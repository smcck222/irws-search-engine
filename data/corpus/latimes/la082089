With television continuing to use actual news events as a source of 
inspiration, real-life incidents invariably turn up as the subjects of new 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example is "Tailspin: Behind the Korean Airliner Tragedy," a 
90-minute "HBO Showcase" drama airing Sunday at 9 p.m. on cable's Home Box 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Tailspin" tells about the Korean passenger jet shot down by a Soviet fighter 
plane after straying into Soviet airspace during the summer of 1983, resulting 
in the deaths of all 269 people aboard, including 66 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It also focuses on the political turmoil that took place in Washington in 
response to the international incident. 
</P>
<P>
The cast includes Michael Moriarty, Michael Murphy, Chris Sarandon and Harris 
Yulin.

<P>
Pennies From Heaven (Channel 5 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is the musical as an art film, 
a work of fantasy so stylized and sophisticated as to be rightly described as 
experimental. Steve Martin lip-syncs his way through the Depression-era 
standards as a breezy Chicago sheet-music salesman who falls on hard times -- 
and in love with demure schoolteacher Bernadette Peters. Directed by Herbert 
Ross and written by Dennis Potter, Pennies From Heaven is the story of this 
couple's struggle to find a little happiness and joy in a bleak world far 
removed from the bright promises held out by all those songs so beloved by 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 Heat (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), Burt Reynolds is a believable 
tough guy, a hard-core gambler and low-rent bodyguard, but the film is just 
another bumpy, tedious ride through seamy Vegas streets. 
</P>
<P>
When Hitchcock's psychological mystery Marnie (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) was 
released 25 years ago, it was not highly acclaimed by most critics yet even 
then it had its defenders. Tippi Hedren stars as a compulsive thief, and Sean 
Connery is her boss, who struggles to understand her. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanging Tree (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.), a highly regarded 1959 Western, 
stars Gary Cooper as a doctor who nurses a young blind woman, played 
impressively by Maria Schell. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about mixing genres: Nick Knight (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie 
starring Rick Springfield as a police detective who also happens to be a 
vampire. 
</P>
<P>
Irreconcilable Differences (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is one of the wittiest 
Hollywood movies of the '80s. Ryan O'Neal and Shelley Long star as a struggling 
director and his screenwriter-wife whose lives spin out of control when O'Neal 
finally gets his big break to such an extent that their daughter (Drew 
Barrymore) sues them for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
The Spy Who Loved Me (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), the 10th James Bond film, achieved 
a kind of perfection of preposterousness. Not only one, but two nuclear subs 
(one British, one Russian) have disappeared without a trace. Giving chase are 
both 007 (Roger Moore) and Soviet Agent XXX (Barbara Bach), which leads them to 
the underwater palace of supervillain Curt Jurgens. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a nine-hour British TV miniseries, Tony Palmer's ponderous Wagner 
(Channel 13 Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is shown as a two-part biography with 
Richard Burton in the title role as the German composer. 
</P>
<P>
Nightmare at Bitter Creek (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a 1988 TV movie, is a cut 
above the usual "ordinary people in mortal danger" shoot-'em-up fare. Four 
women on horseback -- Lindsay Wagner, Constance McCashin, Joanna Cassidy and 
Janne Mortil -- and their alcoholic mountain guide (Tom Skerritt) are marked 
for death when they inadvertently stray into the path of fugitive white 
supremacists. In the middle of all the mayhem Skerritt's shaky hero and Wagner, 
bruised from a recent divorce, make a believable emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
House Calls (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a quite enjoyable kind of 
live-action cartoon for grown-ups: farcical, mildly risque and quick-stepping 
in its broader-than-life way. As a widowed doctor, Walter Matthau is a joy to 
watch as he rages like a dyspeptic moose. Glenda Jackson plays a woman of 
fierce independence and strong opinions with whom he collides. 
</P>
<P>
Midnight Lace (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is that set-in-London 1960 
thriller more notable for its cast -- Doris Day, Rex Harrison, John Gavin, 
Myrna Loy, Roddy McDowall and Herbert Marshall -- and for its decor than for 
its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Harold and Maude (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is that lovely 1972 cult 
classic, written by Colin Higgins, directed by Hal Ashby and starring Bud Cort 
as a suicidal 20-year-old rescued by Ruth Gordon's 79-year-old swinger. 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock's 1936 Secret Agent (Channel 24 Friday at 9:30 p.m.) is an odd, 
offbeat blend of humor and terror. Madeleine Carroll and John Gielgud play 
secret agents who pose as man and wife while on assignment to kill enemy spies. 
Robert Young and Lilli Palmer co-star.

Why is it when there finally comes a program that has some substance to it and 
it is meaty and grown-up that it is pulled from the airwaves? I am referring to 
"Heartbeat." It was a great program, along with others that have been pulled 
before they are given a fair chance. I don't know who is polled or what their 
mentality is, but give us a break, and no more sitcoms that need the brain of 
an insect to enjoy. Let's be real. Give us something worth turning on the 
television. "Heartbeat," "A Year in the Life," "Our House" and so many others 
have been given the round file. Good grief.

TALES FROM THE FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
BABIES ARE BORN. PIANISTS PERFORM. KANGAROOS CRUISE. AND STUFF SPILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

as a Times staff writer. Elizabeth Venant writes for The Times' View section.

It is 5:56 a.m. on a Tuesday, and the freeway situation map that covers one 
wall of the Caltrans Traffic Operations Center in downtown Los Angeles already 
glows with a gaudy necklace of red lights. They show that top speeds on the 
inbound San Bernardino Freeway have slowed to less than 20 m.p.h. Other 
freeways are starting to go amber, indicating speeds of 20 to 35, but most are 
still largely green. Over 35. Not bad, considering the hour. The center 
monitors the freeway system around the clock, relaying problems to radio and TV 
stations and flashing warnings to motorists via electronic signboards. This 
morning, the National Weather Service has predicted showers, and it won't take 
much rain to harden these arteries into a mad tangle of jackknifed semis, 
rippled fenders, spilled loads, cursing drivers and overworked paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Polzin shows up to share the dayside 
watch with three or four Caltrans traffic engineers in the center. The small 
computer screen bringing incident reports from the CHP's dispatch center on 
Vermont Avenue is getting a little cluttered as more drivers head for work. 
Polzin, an affable 20-year veteran of the CHP, scans the Freeway Status Display 
mural, which covers Los Angeles County as well as adjacent chunks of Ventura 
and Orange counties. I-5 is bright red in the Irvine area as electronic 
pavement sensors transmit the speeds and number of vehicles on the move -- or, 
in spots, not moving at all. "About normal," Polzin observes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get some rain," remarks Caltrans traffic engineer Richard Droullard, 
"things will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 They always do. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN A YOUNG MAN RAN OUT OF gas one night in 1985 on Interstate 10 in Covina, 
he used the dubious method of sticking his finger into the tank to assure 
himself the gas was gone. The spring-loaded flap snapped shut on his hand, 
pinning him to his car. 
</P>
<P>
He had to wait an hour before a man in a pickup stopped and offered to help. 
The young man asked his would-be rescuer to go get him some gas while he 
continued to try to free his finger. As he took out his wallet to give the man 
some money, the Good Samaritan grabbed the wallet and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
With his free arm, the hapless fellow finally hailed a highway patrol car. "He 
was really embarrassed," says Officer Mark Roe, adding that he and his partner, 
Reuben Rios, "would take turns going back to our patrol car to giggle." 
</P>
<P>
Using a coat hanger, Roe and Rios worked for 20 minutes to loosen the finger. 
Finally, they called the fire department and, with the help of a lubricant, the 
young man was freed two hours after he got stuck. 
</P>
<P>
While the firefighters were working in the glow of their truck's flashing 
emergency lights, a car pulled up behind. When the highway patrolmen asked if 
he needed help, the inebriated driver replied: "No, I'm just stopping for the 
traffic lights." 
</P>
<P>
Roe and Rios swear the whole story is true. 
</P>
<P>
HOVSEP TATEOSIAN REMEMBERS thinking it was going to be a "lucky day." The 
38-year-old former welder had just started driving a taxi in January of last 
year when he decided to get in some extra work on a Sunday morning. He hoped to 
pick up a fare for Disneyland at one of the downtown Los Angeles hotels. 
</P>
<P>
He was stopped for a red light at Beaudry Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard when he 
noticed a bearded man in a blue dress sitting on the curb of the Harbor Freeway 
overpass. As Tateosian watched, the man suddenly jumped up and grabbed a 
passing pedestrian, 61-year-old Lilla Joy, first throwing her down, then 
picking her up and dangling her over the guardrail above the roaring freeway 
traffic. "Look down there," Tateosian heard the bearded man yell. "That's where 
you're going to go." Joy clung to the rail in terror. 
</P>
<P>
Several drivers stopped and honked their horns in a futile effort to frighten 
the man away. Only Tateosian took action. He ran the red light, swerved around 
the corner and screeched to a halt on the bridge. Jumping from his cab, he 
shouted at the man to let the woman go. That got him nothing but an angry 
glare, which Tateosian later described as "eyes like an eagle when he's trying 
to get his prey." Tateosian grabbed a tire iron from his cab and promised, "If 
you throw her over, you're going after her." 
</P>
<P>
The man screamed a few obscenities, dropped Joy on the sidewalk and ran. He was 
caught by police a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
Tateosian, who was born in Armenia and grew up in Afghanistan, was cited by 
Caltrans for bravery. "My dad always told me," he said then, "that if you watch 
out for kids and women, then God will protect you." 
</P>
<P>
CHP OFFICER LYLE WHITTEN, 54, will never forget what happened one night in 
1970, when he had been in the CHP less than a year. At about midnight, he and 
his partner were trying to move stalled traffic past a non-injury collision on 
the southbound San Diego Freeway near Wilmington. Suddenly, a drunk driver 
going 60 m.p.h. plowed into the rear of a dead-still Cadillac. The two 
officers, a quarter of a mile away, heard the explosion of the Cadillac's gas 
tank and turned to see the bright orange glow. They jumped into their car and 
worked back along the edge of the jam. It took, Whitten estimates, a minute and 
a half. 
</P>
<P>
When they got there, flaming gasoline had spread across several lanes. A man, a 
woman and a little girl of about 3 were rolling on the ground, screaming. 
Motorists were out of their cars, staring in horror. The parents were so badly 
burned, it looked as if they didn't have a chance. Whitten grabbed the child, 
his partner got behind the wheel and the patrol car took off with red lights 
flashing and siren screaming. Whitten clutched the little girl, smothering the 
flames that had burned off most of her hair and clothing. Her skin was falling 
off in his hands. She kept shrieking, "I want my daddy!" They made it to Harbor 
General Hospital in three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
By the next day she was dead, as were her parents. After her grandmother called 
the CHP to ask about the fate of a second granddaughter, an infant's body was 
found in the charred wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"It stuck with me all of these years," Whitten says. "I had a 3-year-old girl 
at that time. That's all I could think of. We just couldn't work the rest of 
the night. We called the sergeant and said we couldn't go back in the field. We 
were done in." 
</P>
<P>
DURING HIS 11 YEARS AS A PARAMEDIC, Jim May saved a lot of people and saw many 
die, but he was called upon only twice to deliver babies. "I had one partner 
who claimed to have had about 30 deliveries, and another had 18 or 20," May, 
39, says. "But I was rarely in the right place at the right time." Then, last 
summer, soon after he was promoted to captain in the Long Beach Fire Department 
and thought he was out of the baby-delivery business for good, he got his 
chance for one more. 
</P>
<P>
Anna and George Tu of Garden Grove, who had come here from Vietnam seven years 
earlier, were speeding toward the hospital for the birth of their sixth child 
when it became clear the baby was not going to wait. The father saw CHP Officer 
John Chilcot on the side of the San Gabriel Freeway near Wardlow Road, pulled 
his minivan over and asked for help. May heard the call in his fire station, 
which had no paramedic team, and though it was no longer in his job 
description, he jumped at the chance. He reached the couple first. 
</P>
<P>
May misunderstood from their rudimentary English that this was their first 
child and assumed that it would be a protracted birth, that paramedics, who 
would have also heard the call, would arrive in time to actually make the 
delivery. He was astonished when a 7-pound, 13-ounce boy dropped into his hands 
just as reinforcements pulled up. "All I had to do was catch," May said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
PEEVISH BEES, STAMPEDING CATTLE, boats, pianos, mayonnaise, fish, broken 
watermelons, bananas, hot asphalt, soft drinks, margarita mix, tomatoes, beer, 
150 tons of honey, a wild boar's head, a 5-foot-tall papier-mache rhinoceros, a 
U.S. Navy depth charge, sides of beef and mannequins -- all of these things 
have littered Southern California freeways. Two exhibitors heading for the San 
Diego County Fair in Del Mar once lost a dead, 15-foot, 2,000-pound great white 
shark on the Escondido Freeway when their trailer overturned. 
</P>
<P>
There have been at least three armored-car mishaps on Southern California 
freeways, the most recent last Dec. 7, when a Loomis truck hauling $500,000 
worth of coins broke an axle on the Pomona Freeway in Rowland Heights. Highway 
patrol officers stood guard with shotguns, remembering that when a Brinks truck 
sprinkled the Hollywood Freeway near Cahuenga Pass with $7,000 in dimes and 
quarters, motorists jumped out of their cars and managed to get away with about 
10% of the loot. 
</P>
<P>
One spill resulted in a drama so long-running it has passed into the realm of 
urban myth. In the late 1960s, a poultry truck overturned and dumped more than 
three dozen chickens along the embankment of the southbound Hollywood Freeway 
at Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood. Nesting in the shrubbery at the side of 
the freeway, the chickens prompted complaints from motorists by wandering out 
on the roadway and stopping traffic. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly widow named Minnie Blumfield made the chickens famous when she began 
spending $30 a month of her Social Security check to feed the small flock. She 
sprinkled seed through the chain-link fence, and the chickens multiplied until 
estimates of their numbers reached as high as 75. "They're just chickens," 
Blumfield said, "but I do love them." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she and a neighbor, actress Jodie Mann, persuaded Caltrans to let 
animal regulation crews trap the birds and truck them off to a farm in Sylmar. 
It took three months to catch them with baited traps. Blumfield, then in her 
90s, died in 1977. Some of the chickens must have evaded capture because a few 
still live at the edge of the freeway, according to CHP Officer Monty Keifer. 
"We had a chicken hunt and tried to catch them," Keifer says, "but we weren't 
too successful. As soon as we showed up, they took off into the bushes." 
</P>
<P>
Mann says the story of Minnie and her chickens is a persistent favorite; every 
couple of years a journalist calls her to revive it. The last call prompted 
Mann to dust off a screenplay she wrote about the incident a few years ago and 
"try to peddle it around town." Some people at a major studio, she says, are 
"very interested." 
</P>
<P>
RAYMOND OPPENHEIM, 37, WAS walking across the Los Angeles Street bridge over 
the Hollywood Freeway on the evening of Aug. 18, 1987, when he saw a man and a 
woman straddling the guardrail. They were, he told police later, "talking to 
each other, acting kind of crazy. . . . " It wasn't until he heard the squeal 
of brakes on the freeway below that he realized they had jumped. "I should have 
stopped them," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Both were struck by automobiles and died. Cards on the bodies identified them 
as Marigail Richardson, 35, and her husband, Peter, 40. Their only address was 
a Chula Vista postal box. It was days before the coroner's office learned that 
they had been living in a Pasadena board-and-care home. Marigail grew up in 
Houston, where her mother said she had been a "beautiful child." But she 
drifted away from Houston after bouts with epilepsy and stays in mental 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
After one marriage and divorce, she met and married Peter, a Shanghai-born 
Vietnam War veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress. The couple moved 
from state to state in an apparent search for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
In their last days, a friend at the board-and-care home said the Richardsons 
became inexplicably upset, saying they "couldn't take it anymore." They set 
fire to the wastebasket in their room and were told they would have to leave. 
That night they jumped from the freeway bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The car that struck Marigail belonged to a family from Houston. They were here 
on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
THE FREEWAY CAN BE AS GOOFY AS IT is grim. There was, for instance, Sandra 
Tsing Loh, a composer who borrowed a white Steinway grand piano and set it atop 
the Citicorp Plaza parking structure in downtown Los Angeles on Labor Day 
weekend of 1987 to serenade Harbor Freeway motorists. Loh said the traffic 
noise enhanced "the musical environment." Whether any motorists actually heard 
the concert isn't clear, but a lot of them waved. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Ralph Elvira remembers that two or three years ago on the Golden 
State Freeway near Newhall he pulled alongside a man who had spread a newspaper 
across his steering wheel while driving at moderate speed. Elvira assumed the 
motorist would notice him and put the paper aside. But while he watched, the 
driver licked his finger and turned the page. Elvira pulled him over and wrote 
him up for driving at an unsafe speed -- the safe speed for reading at the 
wheel being 0 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Steve Ussher found his own casual driver when he stopped an 
Australian proceeding erratically on the San Diego Freeway near Mission Viejo. 
The problem, the driver explained to Ussher, was that his pet kangaroo kept 
jumping into his lap. Indeed, there was a 3-foot-tall kangaroo sitting on the 
passenger side. "It was wearing a little vest with an Australian logo on the 
back," Ussher says. "The rear seat was full of eucalyptus leaves. The guy was 
doing travel promotion for Australia, trying to drum up tours." Persuaded that 
neither driver nor kangaroo was under the influence, Ussher sent them on their 
way without a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
THE HIGH-SPEED PURSUIT HAS TAKEN on new dimensions as the freeway system has 
grown. It is not uncommon now for drivers to try outracing officers through 
several counties. In November, 1988, a woman led the CHP on a 175-mile chase at 
speeds of more than 110 m.p.h. before finally being stopped at a roadblock on 
State Route 94 near Campo, east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, she explained that she "just wanted to get away from San Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
STEPHENE MOSELEY REMEMBERS thinking that Chris Hoyt had been shot by a sniper 
when he suddenly slumped at the wheel of her Dodge Dart on the Golden State 
Freeway in the San Fernando Valley the night of Oct. 21, 1970. "There was a 
loud explosive noise and there was blood coming off his head," she says. She 
managed to grab the wheel, steer the car to the shoulder and stop, even though 
Hoyt's foot was still jammed down on the accelerator. As another motorist 
pulled up behind them, she ran to him, calling frantically, "My friend's been 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
She was wrong. What killed her then-fiance, a 22-year-old University of 
Redlands graduate student in speech therapy, was a 60-pound chunk of Palos 
Verdes stone dropped from the Peoria Street overpass in the Sun Valley area. 
The point of the boulder punctured the top of the car and pierced Hoyt's brain. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very gifted," says Moseley, now married to a Temple City attorney. His 
parents, Gloria and William Hoyt of Redlands, say their 6-foot, 3-inch son was 
not only a good athlete but also a talented musician who sang and had played 
violin in the University of Redlands orchestra for five years. They sued the 
state for $250,000, pointing out that there had been nine other instances of 
rocks -- and in one case an automobile engine block -- being thrown from the 
Peoria Street overpass. But a jury ruled against them. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Hoyt, as well as those of two other Southern Californians killed 
in similar incidents in other areas within 60 days, did, however, prompt state 
legislation to screen some freeway overpasses accessible to pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"They fenced the Peoria Street overpass within one week of Chris' death," says 
Gloria Hoyt. No one was ever arrested for his murder. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE FROM Carson rented a Cloud 9 limousine for the 
evening, directing the driver, Terry Kunce, to take them to a Westside 
restaurant. Afterward, opening a bottle of champagne in the back seat, they 
closed the cloth-covered divider between the front and rear to indulge the 
husband's long-time fantasy: to make love in a limousine. After the long drive 
back to Carson on the 405, the couple emerged unwrinkled and nonchalantly 
thanked their driver for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"They were neat people," says Kunce. But she reminds similarly inclined clients 
to keep in mind that while the partition between driver and passengers may be 
opaque, it's not soundproof. 
</P>

FORGET money. Forget in-laws. Forget real estate. The biggest conflict between 
modern mates is time. After all, you can make more money. You can move to 
another state to escape his or her parents. You can fix up the house. But you 
can't put more hours in a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone has discovered that time is at a real premi um," says Marcia 
Lasswell, a Claremont family therapist. "Both husbands and wives have such busy 
schedules. It's tough to find time when they can be together." 
</P>
<P>
She's telling me? "Isn't this romantic?" Duke asks as I morosely drag our 
shopping cart around the supermarket. Duke has just started a new job and has 
been working 14 hours a day. And I'm in the throes of a writing frenzy, so my 
schedule is equally crazed. Today is Sunday, and we've cut work back to four 
hours so we can share a few precious moments. "What a great deal on 
cantaloupes!" my husband exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't my idea of meaningful conversation. But I really can't complain. Our 
timetables are so hectic we've been living out of takeout cartons. The cupboard 
is bare, the refrigerator is empty, and even if one of us actually found a few 
spare seconds to tackle the last two weeks' worth of laundry, we'd have to do 
it without soap. 
</P>
<P>
Still, on the Quality Time Scale of 1 to 10, a trip to the supermarket rates a 
2. Our next stop, the dry cleaners, rates a 1. And our next stop, the hardware 
store, gets a minus 6. There's no romance to be found amid the plumbing 
supplies and the dead bolts, no matter how advantageously priced. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I really should count my blessings. Many mates can't even get together to 
run errands. "I never get to see my husband," my friend Nina says blithely. I 
shake my head in dismay. When I called her to lament that Duke and I were 
fighting the clock, I expected sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed always works a minimum of 70 hours a week," Nina informs me. "And he jogs 
every other night. And then there's softball league. And computer club." 
Doesn't she mind? "I'm just grateful he's not a surfer," she says with a laugh. 
"They have to get up at 5 every morning and check the waves." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to stopping and smelling the roses? Duke bounds out of bed at 
7 in the morning. "Gotta run," he says, hurriedly kissing me goodby. "I've got 
a breakfast meeting." 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the good old days, when we used to have romantic breakfast meetings 
in bed?" I ask wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll call you," Duke promises. And he does call. But I'm at the gym. And when 
I call him back, he's in a meeting. And then I'm doing an interview. And then 
he's got an important call on the other line. And so it goes. Love in the Time 
of Telephone Tag. 
</P>
<P>
Some duos don't connect for days. "I get bummed out when he gets home after I'm 
asleep and then he wants to talk," says my friend Sabina. "But then you wake up 
the next morning, and you realize that you don't know what he did yesterday and 
he doesn't know what you did. It's a little strange." 
</P>
<P>
A little strange? Lately, it seems as if the unhurried life isn't worth living. 
Couples aren't simply juggling marriage, careers and children anymore -- 
they're juggling his friends, her friends, their friends, families, therapists, 
pets, charity functions, hobbies and sports. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend's schedule is such that I can work as long as I want Monday 
through Friday without feeling guilty," my friend Andy says. "But golf takes up 
at least five hours a weekend. In order to schedule golf, I've got to encourage 
her to do more things. She'll say, 'I'm thinking of checking out this store.' 
Great, I'll play golf. 'Volunteer work?' Great, I'll play golf. Of course, I 
get really irritated if she's not there as soon as I'm done." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "a marriage isn't going to thrive on neglect," warns Lasswell, the 
family therapist, who adds that "any relationship needs energy and time put 
into it. And not poor-quality time when you're both too pooped to do anything 
but just crash." I shuffle my feet guiltily. "Busy couples have to schedule 
togetherness time or they won't get it," says Lasswell, who recommends that 
husbands and wives make appointments to see each other, "a month in advance if 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe that the Day Runner has become a marital aid. But Nina informs 
me that she and her husband book time for everything -- "including sex." 
Whatever happened to getting carried away by the moment? "Not having 
spontaneous sex isn't so terrible," Nina assures me. That may be true. 
</P>
<P>
But this doesn't sound like my kind of foreplay. "Whenever we set up a sex 
date, we always have a fight," Nina confesses. "There's no intimacy, so we have 
to fight first to reconnect." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many couples spend their precious moments in heated combat. On the 
Quality Time Scale, an intense discussion over why she insists on dragging you 
to a shopping mall, when she knows you hate to shop, rates a 4. Giving him the 
cold shoulder because he's paying more attention to the Dodger game than to you 
rates a 3. And packing your suitcases and threatening to fly to Hawaii -- alone 
-- to see if your mate will even notice that you're gone rates a 5. 
</P>
<P>
But if you really want to ruin the day or evening, there's nothing like trying 
to find a significant Quality Time activity. "It's not enough to read the 
Sunday papers and just hang out together," my friend Claire laments. "It's got 
to be hot stuff. Get the band. Get the majorettes. Get the pompons. You're 
really under the gun to have serious fun." 
</P>
<P>
It's as bad as New Year's Eve -- which, for the record, I've never enjoyed. In 
fact, most of the good times in my life haven't been planned -- they just 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, I'm home," says Duke. But it's only 5:30. In the afternoon. "Want to go 
for a walk on the beach?" Duke asks. 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me. I've got to run.

SEVENTY YEARS AGO, FLORENCE YOCH BROUGHT US EUROPEAN LANDSCAPE DESIGN

Magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE DECADES OF the 1920s and '30s were one of the most active periods of 
California garden design, a time when many grand Los Angeles, Pasadena, Beverly 
Hills and Santa Barbara estates were built. Landscape architect Florence Yoch 
helped develop the style of the time -- a casual but distinctively Californian 
interpretation of classic European gardens. She became an important link in a 
chain of garden design that leads from the villas of Italy and the Moorish 
gardens of Spain to the Mediterranean landscape of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yoch's ideas and designs have been rediscovered and are proving inspirational 
to young landscape architects and designers -- to anyone, for that matter, who 
is trying to make sense of a plot of ground. So it is timely that James J. 
Yoch, now a professor of English at the University of Oklahoma, should document 
his cousin's work in "Landscaping the American Dream: The Gardens and Film Sets 
of Florence Yoch, 1890-1972" (Harry N. Abrams Inc./Sagapress Inc.). Yoch's 
inspiration came also from the formal gardens of France and the wilder, flowery 
gardens of England. She was particularly taken with the work of English garden 
designer and author Gertrude Jekyll, whose books she carried to her various 
jobs. But she developed her own distinctive styles. "Patrician gardens," as 
James Yoch calls them, were designed for the wealthy but restrained Pasadena 
and Montecito clients. There were gardens for movie moguls with "the swagger 
appealing to Hollywood." And there were movie set gardens, including the 
gardens in "Romeo and Juliet" (1936), the rice terraces cut into the hills of 
Chatsworth for "The Good Earth" (1937), and the grounds of Tara in "Gone With 
the Wind" (1939). Later, in the 1950s and '60s, she developed "the wilder, 
asymmetrical Monterey gardens." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Florence Yoch's small gardens that are perhaps her most intriguing 
work, and they seem to have been her personal favorites. James Yoch notes that 
of the particularly pretty garden for the Misses Davenport (1922), she "typed a 
proud message on the back of her photograph: the garden 'illustrates what may 
be accomplished on a narrow city lot. The house and garden are on a lot only 60 
feet wide.' " He continues: "The simplicity of smaller sites may have appealed 
to Yoch more readily than the sprawling ranches of her wealthiest clients, for 
she continually defined intimate spaces in even the grandest schemes. Smaller 
gardens ... required more ingenuity on the part of the designer and more 
imagination from the viewer." 
</P>
<P>
Certain trends in garden design -- among them, the concept of the garden as an 
outdoor room -- that are becoming popular once again are apparent in Florence 
Yoch's work. Author Yoch notes: "Yoch was notably successful even during the 
1920s in designing compact, low-maintenance gardens for forward-thinking 
Californians who wanted charming outdoor rooms." Descriptions of these "outdoor 
rooms" and old photographs offer a great deal of solid advice and insight on 
the design of gardens. 
</P>
<P>
When in search of design ideas, "Yoch took the time -- often several days -- to 
be in gardens long enough to feel the walks, see the changes of light, hear the 
sounds of fountains and birds," writes James Yoch. "She never placed her 
confidence in drawings for she was convinced 'that you can't do a decent job 
just on paper.' " On construction documents, the note "Consult Miss Yoch" 
appears in every margin. It is not that she couldn't draw (many of her drawings 
are in the book); she believed that gardens were more dimensional than any 
sketch could demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
In "Landscaping the American Dream," there is also ample advice on gardening in 
Southern California, beginning with the timeless but still unheeded 
observation, "The man in a hurry is not a good gardener." Of her Beverly Hills 
garden, Mrs. David O. Selznick observed that "Miss Yoch didn't stint there (on 
soil preparation) or on any of the sensible priorities. Money was sunk where it 
didn't show, so we had a grand new house, a splendid tennis court, a few nice 
trees, and many tiny plants. Miss Yoch said we were to practice patience and 
let them grow -- a big order in that overnight town." 
</P>
<P>
Present-day gardeners will be intrigued by some of the information in the back 
of the book. For the George Cukor Garden, for instance, there is a "Plant List 
for Spring Border, September, 1936" which includes tulips with names such as 
'Lemon Queen' and 'Altesa,' ranunculus and dimorphotheca, snapdragons named 
'Buff Beauty' and a rose named 'President Herbert Hoover.' Florence Yoch 
usually included a complete set of instructions with each garden she designed; 
"Garden Maintenance Directions for Mrs. Preston B. Hotchkis" has a gardening 
calendar that is helpful even today. 
</P>
<P>
"Her penchant (was) for the notable feature that gives a garden its special 
character: the worn stone, the shadowed fountain, the venerable tree," writes 
James Yoch. Her choice and siting of plants was always inspirational, the 
reason that these European-influenced gardens look so at home here. As Florence 
Yoch believed: A successful garden is one "in which every plant is significant 
and happily used."

PROTECTION FROM ULTRAVIOLET RAYS AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUNG EYES HAVE IT 
</P>

PINT-SIZED, inexpensive sunglasses perched on button noses are too cute for 
words, but are they ruining the eyes of the children who wear them? Perhaps. 
Eye specialists say that unless the lenses protect against ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation, a child is better off without sunglasses, even on the brightest 
days. The safest approach is to buy sunglasses that block at least 95% of UV 
rays. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing you can do is put a child in sunglasses without UV protection 
because studies have shown that the long-term absorption of UV radiation 
probably contributes to cataracts and may also cause degeneration of the 
retina," says Dr. Sharon Spooner, a clinical instructor of pediatric 
ophthalmology at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In bright sunlight, the pupil of the eye automatically constricts and muscles 
around the eye contract to a squint. This offers natural protection, by letting 
in fewer harmful rays. But when the eye is covered by a dark lens, muscles 
relax and the pupil dilates, allowing more UV rays to enter the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about UV radiation absorption has been a hot topic with regard to adult 
sunglasses for several years, but only recently have studies shown that 
children are particularly vulnerable. So doctors have begun to urge parents to 
protect children's eyes from UV. "I'm prescribing more sunglasses for kids with 
normal vision to make sure that they get adequate UV protection," says Dr. Jay 
Schlanger, an assistant professor at Southern California College of Optometry 
in Fullerton and an optometrist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "Parents are 
now beginning to realize that the more UV you absorb in your lifetime, the more 
susceptible to damage you are. They want their kids to be protected as early as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, optician Katheryn Dabbs-Schramm sells sunglasses sized to fit 
infants at her A Child's View optical shops in El Toro and Huntington Beach. 
"It's commonly thought that parents won't spend money on kids' glasses, so most 
optical shops don't carry children's sizes," she explains. "But I find there is 
no limit to what they'll spend." Although non-prescription infant sunglasses 
with UV protection are only $12, Dabbs-Schramm says the average price of 
children's prescription eyewear is about $150, on a par with the national 
average for adult eyewear. 
</P>
<P>
Makers of over-the-counter sunglasses are not required by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration to label their products with regard to UV protection, but 
this summer a voluntary labeling program was instituted. Eyewear marked 
"General Purpose" and "Special Purpose" provide 95% and 99% UV protection, 
respectively. Schlanger recommends that consumers buy only prescription or 
labeled, over-the-counter sunglasses. He also notes that any pair of sunglasses 
can be coated for UV protection at an optical store for about $15. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents put sunscreen on their children to protect their skin," Spooner says. 
"Now we're talking about their eyes. Proper sunglasses are necessary protection 
against harmful rays."

It is unfathomable that Fox threw $43 million in the drink to produce "The 
Abyss" ("Fox Plunges Into 'The Abyss' ").

<P>
The tale of a submersible extraterrestrial spacecraft setting up a bivouac in 
Davy Jones' locker has already been filmed twice, in two excellent, albeit 
relatively inexpensive, renditions: "The Atomic Submarine" (1959) and 
"Destination Inner Space" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
Both of these versions were marked by imaginative scripting, solid acting and 
fairly decent special effects, especially considering their skeletal budgets.

Forget hunting for the perfect West Coast pastrami sandwich. You gotta go to 
New York for a New York pastrami on rye! 
</P>
<P>
Parenthetically, how could the testers have really gotten a good taste of 
pastrami at The Times? By the time the runner got back, the pastrami must have 
been cold. And no one with any sense of self will eat cold pastrami.

<TEXT>
<P>
Reilly's view that Feiffer's incisive pro-choice cartoon of July 23 is 
"obscene" reflects an appallingly anthropocentric view of the human species. 
Whether or not we are willing to acknowledge it, Homo sapiens is subject to 
natural selection just like any other organism. 
</P>
<P>
We may relish a moment of personal satisfaction when we defy natural selection 
by forbidding a pregnant female the choice to abort an unwanted embryo or when 
we artificially prolong the life of a genetically inferior individual through 
the intervention of modern medicine. But in doing this we are incrementally 
decreasing the survivability and quality of life of the human species by 
allowing socially or genetically unfit individuals to reach reproductive age. 
</P>
<P>
And even if they don't reproduce, individuals who are unable or unwilling to 
make a meaningful contribution to society have a tremendous social cost. And as 
one socially aware person stated, "If you aren't making a meaningful 
contribution to society you're just taking up space." 
</P>
<P>
Eugenics? I think not -- just good biology.

Although we are not a deli, I can't imagine anyone writing on pastrami 
sandwiches in Southern California without mentioning Johnnies Pastrami. We sell

ADS AT THE MOVIES

<TEXT>
<P>
After recently moving from Jacksonville, N.C., where movie tickets cost $4.50, 
I was shocked by the prices here -- $6 to $7. But what disturbs me the most 
about Los Angeles-area theaters is that many show commercials. If I wanted to 
see commercials I would stay home and watch TV, without buying any ticket. 
</P>
<P>
A final note: The commercial I see the most is an obnoxious one that makes no 
sense. Only at the end do we find out who it is for -- the L.A. Times.

SETH STEM'S FURNITURE would be right at home in a modern, multi-million-dollar 
Bel-Air manse. While this book doesn't tell anyone how to make furniture, Stem, 
a well-known furniture designer and teacher, details a series of steps in a 
basic design process. He also presents many full-color photographs of dazzling 
contemporary pieces: Garish Memphis-style chairs, sleek tables, and downright 
weird cabinets are offered as examples of the furniture-maker's art and the 
designer's achievement. Stem includes drawings to illustrate his design points: 
"An Exercise in Proportioning," for instance, shows seven different vertical 
cabinet rectangles, each with distinct details that seem to alter its shape. 
</P>
<P>
Stem also provides standard furniture measurements, drawing techniques, a list 
of necessary tools for design and suggestions for making models and mock-ups -- 
just about everything a designer needs except the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The book is intended for the experienced, professional furniture maker. But 
don't let that daunt you; the pictures and the process are engrossing even to 
furniture spectators. ($24.95) Judith Sims

GOT THE BREAD? HIRE A HOME CHEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't know your arugula from your elbow, or simply too tired to cook? Have you 
overdosed on microwave dinners? Is nightly takeout cuisine getting to be too 
much? 
</P>
<P>
Imagine coming home from a draining day at work to find your table set with a 
meal prepared by your own professional chef -- someone who spends his or her 
days trying to please your particular palate and can prepare anything from a 
six-course Russian feast to a simple Thai salad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$750 a Week 
</P>
<P>
A chef of one's own isn't for everyone -- the going rate is around $750 a week 
-- but the Epicurean Connection Agency is here for those who can afford it. 
Like other domestic agencies, the Epicurean Connection provides household help, 
but it's unique in Los Angeles: a small, specialized service that does nothing 
but match chefs with prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients are used to going out to the best restaurants, and they want the 
same kind of food in their homes," says Susan Rabb, who co-founded the 
placement service in March with partner Shelley Janson. Since then, they've 
specialized in placing highly trained chefs in the homes of entertainment 
industry professionals, old-money families and what they call "the new young 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
Janson, 35, is the founder of the Epicurean Cooking School in West Hollywood, a 
training school for professional chefs. The Epicurean Connection, a licensed 
and bonded domestic employment agency, is an outgrowth of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The partners met at the Epicurean Cooking School when Rabb signed up for 
classes. Originally from New York, she had worked in food marketing for General 
Foods and Campbell's Soups, and was trying to improve her personal cooking 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Janson, meanwhile, was ready to start a new business, and she had already had 
people calling the school, looking for recommendations for trained chefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was staffing local restaurants with sous chefs and pantry people as a 
sideline, for free," says Janson. "Then somebody, once, called me from her home 
and said, 'I need someone, can you help me?' " 
</P>
<P>
That caller was one of L.A.'s more prominent socialites, and the call gave 
Janson the idea that they could make money with a domestic agency specializing 
in nothing but professional chefs for the home. 
</P>
<P>
According to the women, their clients aren't satisfied with a combination 
maid-housekeeper-cook. "It used to be the greatest thing in the world to have 
somebody who was a housekeeper and cooked your meals and did five different 
things," says Janson. "Not any more. People are attuned to what's good. Taste 
levels have changed dramatically. People don't just go into a restaurant today 
and spend $100 and think it's great." 
</P>
<P>
All agency costs are paid by the client; the standard is a flat fee equivalent 
to one month's salary for the chef. For qualified chefs who pass the Epicurean 
Connection's screening process, it costs nothing to list with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chefs on their roster, according to Janson, are "in their 30s, and 
pretty well-rounded. They know about ethnic foods, they know about classic 
French, they know about everything. But the forte for most people today is 
California cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Chefs are also expected to have experience with a recognized school, like the 
Culinary Academy of America, or what Rabb calls "superlative experience" in 
private homes or restaurants. They also must agree to sign a statement of 
confidentiality, if hired, to protect the client's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The matching process begins with Rabb, who conducts an initial interview with 
applicant chefs, including a detailed personality profile, references, 
curriculum vitae, employment history, culinary specialties, and expected 
salary. The chef is also asked to prepare several sample menus. 
</P>
<P>
All information on clients, however, is taken over the telephone. If Rabb and 
Janson think they may have found a good match, they send the chef for an 
interview with the client or the client's assistant, and encourage the client 
to try them out for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
After a successful match, the Epicurean Connection works as the chef's agent, 
settling salary demands, time off and the number of hours to be worked each 
week. If the match ultimately doesn't work, clients have a no-questions-asked 
return guarantee on their chef, and they have the option to go back to the 
Epicurean Connection within 60 days to try again. 
</P>
<P>
Salary is based on a chef's experience, and generally runs between $100 and 
$175 per day. All food costs are paid by the client, and they can be sizable. 
Rabb says that one chef told her that the food costs in the household he 
served, consisting of one couple and their son, ranged from $3,000 to $5,000 
per month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Word of Mouth 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling service began operations with no publicity, and only one small 
advertisement in the magazine Beverly Hills 213. Mostly by word of mouth, the 
Epicurean Connection has been growing slowly and steadily over the last five 
months. Janson and Rabb now have 30 to 40 chefs on file at any particular time, 
and they field three or four calls a week from potential employers. The agency 
has already provided chefs for such clients as Aaron and Candy Spelling, Jerry 
Moss of A&amp;M Records, and producer Keith Addis. 
</P>
<P>
For clients with more money than time, one of the main advantages of employing 
a trained chef is the lack of supervision needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted someone who could take full charge, with very little direction," says 
Kathleen Spiegelman, who came to the Epicurean Connection and has since 
recommended the agency to her friends. She and her husband prefer to entertain 
friends at home rather than in restaurants, and they hired a chef to come in 
five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted someone to cook California cuisine -- fish, chicken, salads, etc.," 
says Spiegelman. "And it's great just to tell a chef that six people are coming 
to dinner, that one of them is a vegetarian, one of them doesn't like this or 
that, and just leave it in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Chefs' specific duties vary as to the needs of the household and the 
temperament of the chef. In some households, the chef will be the only member 
of the kitchen staff; in others, he or she will be part of a unit. Domestic 
chores such as cleaning up the dishes are negotiable, but chefs are generally 
expected to shop for the food they prepare. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people have accounts at the Irvine Ranch Market, at Jurgensen's, 
at Phil's Fish market, and elsewhere, and they expect the chef to get the best 
quality (of food)," says Rabb. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one chef who was expected to go out every week to (Beverly Hills 
delicatessen) Nate 'n Al's," says Janson, "just to get pounds of everything, 
fresh meats and rye bread and all of that. And they would fill the refrigerator 
with all that stuff. And at the end of the week, he would just throw them out 
untouched, but the woman of the house just wanted them in there. And he was 
spending hundreds of dollars every week." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chefs listed with the Epicurean Connection are looking for 
full-time work, like Genee Wilner. She has worked on film sets, cooking for 
stars like Jane Fonda, and has cooked at home for Charles Bronson, Cher, Bob 
Dylan and Norton Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Wilner listed with the agency, and soon found herself working in a private home 
four days a week. She is enthusiastic about the Epicurean Connection, though 
she's left that particular job and is still looking for another full-time 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Other chefs, like Brigitte Wiltzer, prefer that the Connection send them out on 
one-time jobs and catering for special parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really interested in a full-time position in a private home," says 
Wiltzer, who owns her own catering service, Brigitte's Kitchen. She is on the 
agency's roster of chefs for special occasion catering. Though the Epicurean 
Connection has only provided her with two jobs, she considers both Janson and 
Rabb to be friends and speaks of the "high quality" of employers that they have 
provided for her. 
</P>
<P>
Janson and Rabb have no plans to diversify the Epicurean Connection into other 
areas. Placing chefs with restaurants might seem to be a logical offshoot, but, 
according to Janson, the few restaurants that have contacted them about placing 
a chef tend to back away when fees are discussed. "Restaurants will never be 
part of our area. No matter how successful they are, they never have any 
money," she says. "Ninety-nine percent of them are just sneaking by." 
</P>
<P>
These days, someone like Wolfgang Puck is almost as famous as some of the 
people for whom he cooks. Status can be very important in L.A., and keeping up 
with the Joneses can take a lot of money, especially when the Joneses have a 
personal chef. How much of the business at Epicurean Connection is really about 
hiring a status symbol rather than an employee? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think it's much," says Janson. "We did have one lady, but that 
was about all. I find that it's truly a question of need. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients fall into three categories: people who already have a household 
staff and want to augment it, people who are just too busy, and some who are 
maybe married to a woman who doesn't know that she has to do this as part of 
her life."

It was a Sunday. Through the crowd of departing parishioners, the pastor eluded 
her through one door; she chased after him through another. Her voice was 
quiet, firm and full of fury. 
</P>
<P>
"I demand to be counseled," Ruth Bryant White told the Rev. Tom Wolf, pastor of 
The Church on Brady in East Los Angeles, one of the city's most ethnically 
diverse Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
The preacher already had spoken to her future husband, Steve White. She said: 
"I want to know why you decided to do premarital counseling to Steve and did 
not ask me to come." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scriptural Silence 
</P>
<P>
By that time, recalls White, a lean, 34-year-old woman with granite-like, high 
cheekbones, "I really didn't want to be counseled by him. I just wanted to make 
a point: Because I'm black and have had three children doesn't mean I'm dumb. . 
. . I know 'The Word,' " says White, who recently became an ordained, 
nondenominational Christian minister. "And there's nothing scriptural to 
justify a prohibition against interracial marriage." 
</P>
<P>
But the pastor never claimed there was, says Steve White, 40, an elementary 
school teacher. Instead, "he said he was against the marriage because Ruthie 
had been with two other men (the father of her three children born out of 
wedlock) and it was as if she was married to them before she met me. Since that 
was the case, she should make an effort to get back with them. . . . 
Irrespective of the fact that they were never married and these guys are not 
Christians. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Says Ruth White: "We know Brother Tom -- he is still our brother -- has 
interracial couples in his church but they usually are not black and white 
couples. The problem mostly comes . . . when blacks and whites want to marry 
because of society's long-standing prejudice against blacks." 
</P>
<P>
When the pastor failed to persuade Steve White not to proceed with the wedding, 
other members of the congregation "started to work on him," says his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"One handed me a list of 15 reasons why I shouldn't marry Ruth" and did 
everything short of pounding the list to the door like Martin Luther, says 
Steve. Nonetheless, the couple were married by a minister in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But they believe that things have not improved much since then for other 
evangelical Christians who are considering, or already are in, an interracial 
marriage and want counseling based on the tenets of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the couple in 1984 formed "A Place for Us," a Christian ministry 
based in Gardena. The Whites both are certified Christian counselors and were 
ordained in 1984 as nondenominational Christian ministers by Living Waters Inc. 
of Garden Grove. They also are the authors of "Free Indeed, the Autobiography 
of an Interracial Couple," and have appeared on locally and nationally 
televised talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, 44, and the pastor of The Church on Brady for 20 years, is pained by the 
Whites' "misinterpretation" of events in 1980. He does not remember ever 
counseling either of them. Further, if he had, it would be inappropriate to 
reveal what went on in a pastoral counseling session with them or any other 
church member, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But in principle, he adds: "We try to take seriously the Judeo-Christian world 
view, the deep affirmative world view of the unity of the human race." 
</P>
<P>
Any kind of "mixed marriage," he insists, has problems built into it. "A man 42 
marrying a woman 22 is a mixed marriage" and will have its problems, too. 
People from different "socioeconomic backgrounds" are a mixed couple. "But the 
only situation that is passed onto children is the interethnic one. . . . When 
you get on to larger ethnic diversions and gene isolation and then pass it on 
to children you have to work with" what perceived physical differences mean in 
society. "Many times bicultural children, based on ethnic and racial 
appearance, feel they don't fit in either world," he says, adding that he 
raises these issues for examination, not to condemn interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
While most Christian ministers preach against prejudice from the pulpit, 
"benign neglect" typifies the attitude of most pastors toward the issue of 
interracial marriage, Steve White claims. "The racism is often subtle." 
</P>
<P>
Christian counselors and clergy "are often into denial about the challenges 
interracial couples face in a racist society," says Ruth White. "Christian 
individuals and couples dealing with interracial issues obviously don't benefit 
from either denial or neglect. They need positive guidance, something concrete 
to give them spiritual strength. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a city, this is a country becoming more diverse every day . . . look 
at all the blacks and Hispanics and Asians who are drawn to the evangelical 
movement, who are born again. We don't push interracial marriage, but it's 
inevitable that there will be more and more in this kind of social 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Evangelicals, based in Wheaton, Ill., estimates that 20% 
to 25% of Americans describe themselves as "born-again" Christians. How many of 
those are black, Latino, Asian or other ethnic minorities is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people believe in God," says Ruth White. "They want to go to church, 
they want to bring their children up right . . . but the very thing they 
believe in is turning them away in many instances." 
</P>
<P>
Many Christian ministers might counter that interracial marriage is still 
relatively rare in the United States and there is little social motivation to 
preach about it. 
</P>
<P>
But the increases in these marriages have been "statistically significant," 
says Steve Rawlings, a U.S. Census Bureau family demographer. In 1988, there 
were 218,000 marriages between blacks and whites, compared to 181,000 in 1970, 
three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down anti-miscegenation laws. 
In 1970, there were 310,000 interracial marriages beyond those involving blacks 
and whites. In 1986, the last year for which figures are available, these 
marriages had more than doubled to 827,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jack Hayford -- pastor of First Four-Square Church of Van Nuys and an 
internationally known and respected Pentecostal clergyman -- explains that "I 
wouldn't say anything any differently to (an interracial couple) than I would 
to any other couple." At his 7,000-member church, also known as the Church on 
the Way, "we have a very involved prewedding counseling program" that lasts 
eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Couples also have three sessions in private with a member of the pastoral 
staff. "In these encounters, at the private level and the group level, one of 
the great challenges any couple has is to appreciate the social, economic and 
spiritual values and family traditions" that may differ between families. While 
these differences might exist because they are from "different ethnic groups or 
racial cultures . . . it would not be discussed from the standpoint of a racial 
or ethnic matter, but simply as a human matter." 
</P>
<P>
Some Christian leaders, however, "actually preach against interracial 
marriage," asserts Steve White, who claims Dr. James Dobson's ministry is one. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, whose $12.2-million ministry headquarters is in Pomona, is not an 
ordained minister but a broadcaster and Christian psychologist to the nation's 
evangelical families. He is considered one of the most influential voices in 
conservative Protestant America. 
</P>
<P>
His "Focus on the Family" radio shows are heard on 1,300 radio stations. And 
while his lay ministry -- he is a layman in the Church of the Nazarene -- 
addresses primarily family issues, he has become a political figure, too. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, 
called Dobson the Religious Right's "rising star." An ardent foe of abortion 
and pornography, Dobson served on the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on 
Pornography in 1985-86, one of several Reagan Administration appointments. Last 
year, he was among those conservatives who urged Congress not to override 
former President Reagan's veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson was out of the country and could not be reached. But a spokesman, Paul 
Hetrick, a Focus vice president, said that Focus on the Family does not 
"actively oppose" interracial marriage, nor has it ever done a program on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed to answer questions on interracial marriage -- "and we haven't 
been pressed often at all," says Hetrick -- the group has recommended that 
people contact organizations like A Place for Us. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Risky Business' 
</P>
<P>
But, Hetrick says, "I think Dr. Dobson believes, and Focus takes the position, 
that marriage is a risky business, not just interracial marriage, but any 
marriage. . . . And it is difficult to forge a successful relationship even 
under the best of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"In interracial marriages there are even greater strains on the relationships. 
Typically, couples can undergo rejection by family members and (there are) the 
strains of cultural differences. All these place added stress on the children 
and the marriage. . . . For those reasons, Dr. Dobson would not recommend 
interracial marriage -- not because of racial discrimination -- but because it 
often leads to marital problems." 
</P>
<P>
Says Church on the Way pastor Hayford: "That point of view . . . is humorous to 
me now. . . . I don't mean that I think that it's humorous today that anybody 
thinks it." But those sociological barriers are "precisely . . . the substance 
of the statement I concluded in a paper I wrote in graduate studies 25 years 
ago. It's humorous that I once thought that and hear it repeated back in my 
ears by somebody in 1989. That's not meant as a slur on Focus on the Family. I 
never have a negative point of observation to make about other ministries. It's 
just humorous today that anybody thinks it." 
</P>
<P>
Hayford, 55, is a regular on Christian television, is heard on 70 radio 
stations and in 1985 was named one of the nation's 10 leading 
Pentecostal-Charismatic church leaders by Charisma magazine, a leading 
publication in the field. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Oakland, Hayford says that despite having many black friends as a 
youth, he was a product of the "socially segregated culture" that characterized 
America most of this century. So, "I find it believable that segments of the 
Christian church, which are essentially WASPish -- and I don't mean that 
unkindly, it's just a fact" -- can't imagine any other conclusion than the one 
Dobson reached on interracial marriage. "It's not even a matter of being 
racist. It's just that you can't imagine anything else . . . because your life 
isn't exposed to anything else other than that general order of experience." 
</P>
<P>
What "helped open my eyes has been living in this stew pot of L.A.," says 
Hayford. "I know that it's a farce in God's eyes that people should not 
intermarry. And as I traveled more internationally . . . I began to discover in 
the Christian Church in foreign nations interracial couples. I encountered them 
so constantly that I recognized what had been a sociological position in my own 
mind was in fact nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest Protestant denomination, the 14.7-million-member Southern 
Baptist Convention -- of which Wolf's Church on Brady is a member -- has 
numerous projects aimed at serving the country's increasing ethnic and racial 
pluralism. The denomination does not know the racial and ethnic makeup of its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
But it does know what the face of America is now and what it is projected to 
look like by the third or fourth decade of the 21st Century. It then will be a 
nonmajority population, with most of the population growth among nonwhites -- 
primarily Latinos, according to the Population Reference Bureau in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explicit Discussions 
</P>
<P>
That scenario is discussed "quite explicitly," says the Rev. Dr. Emmanuell 
McCall, 53, who directs the Black Church Extension division of the Southern 
Baptist Convention Home Mission Board in Atlanta, which is responsible for 
evangelism and church growth in the United States and its territories. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we try to do at the six Southern Baptist seminaries, and in 
ethics and other classes that deal with human behavior, is prepare pastors to 
counsel in a way that accepts that kind of diversity as a given in our 
society," he said. "And then, be prepared to counsel people who intend to 
intermarry in a way that prepares them for the challenges without necessarily 
cautioning them against it." 
</P>
<P>
Further, says McCall, "we help to develop churches that would be open and 
supportive to anybody who may come into their midsts, rather than be 
exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Theory and practice don't always mesh, he agrees, but adds: "There has been and 
continues to be a widening acceptance of black and ethnic peoples" in every 
aspect of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
"Having come to this agency 21 years ago, I remember how very racist it was. As 
a black man who has come up through the ranks and gone high in the structure, 
and been able to bring others along with me, I'm pleased with the progress 
we've made. But I wouldn't rest on any laurels. We still have a ways to go." 
</P>
<P>
Catholicism, like Judaism, is more concerned with issues of faith, not race, in 
intermarriages. The Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles' Office of Family Life 
offers extensive premarital counseling for Catholics. In the archdiocese, 
couples receive formal counseling, which may last one day, an evening or a 
weekend, said Father James C. Gehl, director of the Office of Family Life. 
</P>
<P>
In the formal sessions, engaged couples can raise issues of concern to them, 
explains Gehl. More important, all couples meet several times with their parish 
priest and can explore more intimate matters in depth. "Interracial couples," 
he says, "are still an exception, especially when you talk about color. A 
little more common when you talk about ethnic background, for example, an 
Oriental with an Anglo." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that, too, constitutes an interracial couple, he says: "Yes, that's 
true. I guess I'm thinking black-white. I haven't seen as many of those, though 
they surely take place. And the church has no problem with that. But there are 
no specific points that we want to bring across in regard to interracial 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops recently published a handbook for 
parish priests to use in pastoral premarriage counseling called "Faithful to 
Each Other Forever." It does not cover interracial couples, Gehl says, adding, 
"That's interesting. It's an area of concern, but obviously the Catholic Church 
has not seen it as a major stumbling block. If it had been, no doubt it would 
have come out in this study." 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Brown, 40, is a black Christian married to a Jew. His two children 
are being raised Jewish. He has no plans to convert to Judaism and sees no 
problem in raising his children in a home with a dual religious identity -- 
perhaps because he is not "tied to any religious dogma. And I believe in the 
Old Testament," as do Jews, says the financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, his wife, Nancy, and children "pray to the same God." There is no 
problem, he says. He was even one of the original board members of Temple Shir 
Shalom in Mar Vista, the Reform synagogue his family attends. 
</P>
<P>
Shir Shalom's rabbi, Neil Comess-Daniels, thinks the Brown children one day may 
confront problems from their growing up in a mixed-background family. But 
that's because Roosevelt Brown has not converted to Judaism, not because he is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he is black has never entered into anything here," the rabbi 
says. "I think that's because Reform Jews are sophisticated enough to know that 
Moses was a . . . lot blacker than I. Jesus probably looked like Anwar Sadat." 
</P>
<P>
Jews, says Comess-Daniels, did begin "as a people who were intent upon keeping 
their 'racial purity' intact. The early Biblical stories note how the founding 
fathers and mothers of the tradition wanted their own children to go back to 
their own family, in their own homeland and marry distant cousins rather than 
marry idol worshipers -- the pagans they were living around. That perspective 
broke down when the Jews went into Egypt . . . because we came out as what is 
called the mixed multitude." 
</P>
<P>
During the "400 years we were supposedly enslaved in Egypt, there was a good 
deal of intermarriage going on and it was at least somewhat tolerated. That is 
the way some of us interpret the mixed multitude." 
</P>
<P>
Moses, he says, "was married to an Ethiopian." As for Moses himself, "whatever 
race he was, we are not sure, because his mother and father were slaves and 
their racial background we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Reform, Conservative or Orthodox, rabbis all state emphatically that 
race has never been a barrier to marriage between Jews. It's not even 
considered an intermarriage, which Jews consider to be a marriage between a Jew 
and a non-Jew, says Conservative Rabbi Paul Dubin, executive vice president of 
the Los Angeles Board of Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind that an Orthodox Jew would accept the marriage 
of a dark Yemenite and a Caucasian Jew, both being Jewish, as against a Jew 
marrying a Catholic, both being good-looking, blond, blue-eyed Caucasians, 
because there is a chance that the children would be lost to the Catholic or 
Christian tradition," Dubin says. 
</P>
<P>
As for Comess-Daniels' interpretation of the "mixed-multitude," Jack Simcha 
Cohen, an Orthodox rabbi and now president of the Los Angeles rabbis' board, 
agrees with it -- in part. There have been, he says, conversions to Judaism 
among "different nations and different races throughout the world." So Jews are 
a mixed multitude. But "are we, by nature, a mixed racial and cultural lot? 
That's a pretty high level of conjecture with zero possibility of demonstrative 
proof. Therefore, anybody who wants to can make any leap into the unknown, and 
that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sense of "peoplehood" that exists among Jews -- an ethnic 
identify that transcends religion -- it can be difficult for a converted Jew to 
be fully accepted socially by other Jews, says Comess-Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
African-Americans like Roosevelt Brown have their own sense of peoplehood and 
tradition, too, though it is possible to incorporate both the African-American 
and Jewish cultural traditions in a Jewish home, says Comess-Daniels. That is 
one of the many challenges in a pluralistic society, says the rabbi, sitting in 
his office in a building he shares with an Episcopal church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Across the Centuries 
</P>
<P>
He leans forward. He has a final story: Not long ago, a contingent of American 
Jews went to an Ethiopian province. "They landed in a jet, then took a 
five-seater plane, then they had to go by horseback and then walk." 
</P>
<P>
One among the Americans spoke Amharic and translated. "Where's the synagogue?" 
he asked the Ethiopian Jews. They pointed to a hut that looked like all the 
others, only bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the ark where the Torah is?" the translator asked. It was. "And what 
is your Torah portion for this week?" The translator started to cry, the rabbi 
said. The others asked him why. "We have not been connected with these people 
for centuries and it's the same Torah portion . . . word for word. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes somebody Jewish. That connection, that vibration. There are 
Jews of all races." 
</P>
<P>
And nowhere is it written that a Jew, whatever color, should not marry a Jew. 
</P>

ALICE KAHN: WE'VE REACHED CIRCUIT OVERLOAD ON THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opinions. Do we have too many of them? Do we need more of them? Opinions -- 
bulwark of democracy or high-fiber diet for radio? Go ahead, caller. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't even walk into a hardware store to pick up a bungee cord without 
being drawn into a conflict. In fact, there I was, standing in line buying two 
bungee cords to replace the one the raccoon ate off my garbage can last night. 
</P>
<P>
 Raccoons. Cute animals or cunning antagonists? Go ahead, caller. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in front of me in line suddenly starched up and said to the clerk, "I 
find that T-shirt extremely offensive." 
</P>
<P>
We were at Ace -- Ace is the place with the helpful hardware man. Except that 
this helpful hardware man was wearing a T-shirt that said: "Adolf Hitler World 
Tour, 1938-1945." There was a drawing of Hitler on the front, and on his back 
was a list of the cities Hitler had visited. 
</P>
<P>
REACTION. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, yeah, a lot of people told me it was offensive," said the helpful 
hardware man in the Hitler shirt, who was actually a boy of about 19. He was 
noticeably muscular and blond, and he was wearing camouflage-style pants. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me that maybe the shirt wasn't a joke. Maybe he was one of the 
phantom Nazi skinheads who keep attacking people. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you a Nazi?" I asked. "You know there really are Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
"No," the kid said, getting angry. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm offended, and I'm going to write a letter to the owner of the 
store," said the man in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Do what you want," said the kid, and then he just stalked away from the cash 
register, leaving us standing there. 
</P>
<P>
Now I was stuck. In a hurry. Just wanting a bungee cord, not a moral dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Moral dilemmas. Spiritual breakthrough or waste of time? Coming up after this 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, I know the shirt was a satire on the rock 'n' roll tour 
shirts you see everywhere. On the other hand, what if a Holocaust survivor 
walked in and had to cope with that? 
</P>
<P>
I did have the urge to teach the kid a lesson -- a history lesson. To ask him 
the obvious questions about events that happened 45 years ago. And I could hear 
him saying, "Yeah, yeah. It's just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Then we could get into a dialogue, an extended dialogue about his right to wear 
jokes and his right to wear flags and his right to vote on whether I have a 
baby. And -- yeah, yeah -- the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
REPLACEMENT. 
</P>
<P>
Another clerk came. I bought my bungee cords and went home. 
</P>
<P>
And I was thinking about how weary I am of reacting. Of taking sides. Of having 
opinions. How little is accomplished in these my-ideas-are-better-than-yours 
tests of tongue. How everything gets trivialized as we go on automatic Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Actions -- do they speak louder than words? Next time I go into the hardware 
store, should I lecture the kid or snap a bungee cord on his nose? Should I 
write the owner or organize a boycott? Do I have to do something or can I just 
watch Oprah? 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead, caller.

LESSONS FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ON CAMPUS VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read "Campus Crime Crusade" (by Beverly Beyette, Aug. 10) with mixed 
feelings. I am grateful for the article but wish it had gone one step further. 
</P>
<P>
In a month we are sending our youngest child and only daughter to a UC campus 
so we need to know the extent of violent crimes on the campuses. During a 
two-day orientation for parents and students in June, school officials avoided 
the issue of campus violence and focused instead on academic challenges, 
extracurricular activities and homesickness. Rape was only mentioned once; I 
brought it up in the question-and-answer period. 
</P>
<P>
Our daughter, faced with leaving home for the first time, will be alarmed by 
the article and begin to doubt her decision to go away to school. Her needs and 
those of the many students entering college this fall would have been better 
served by a less graphic description of Jeanne Clery's murder and a more 
thoughtful comparison of the incidence of violent crime on campus with other 
threats to student safety -- alcohol-related deaths, suicide, AIDS, steroid 
use. An accompanying column with a checklist of positive steps an individual 
student can take to minimize the chance of becoming a victim of campus violence 
would have given our daughter what she needs to develop a plan for action. 
</P>
<P>
The painful experience of the Clery family shocks us into facing a problem on 
college campuses. Many of us cannot wait for the universities to install new 
security systems. We must begin by facing the campus violence issue with our 
college-bound children and offering them the means to protect against it.

ON VIEW: MUSIC CENTER BEGINS NEW FUND-RAISING ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The amazements of charity fund-raising never cease. The Music Center raises $14 
million in one year, and it begins all over. No wonder William A. Carter, 
amidst all his accolades from Music Center chairman of the board and first 
Interstate Bancorp chairman Joseph Pinola for Carter's leadership success in 
this year's triumph, was kidding Maurice DeWald, who must raise $15 million as 
Campaign '90 chairman. "We are woefully behind," joked Carter. 
</P>
<P>
But if Carter, a Southland resident of only three years (he's vice chairman of 
Ernst &amp; Young), can do it, so can DeWald, managing partner of Peat Marwick 
Main &amp; Co. and formerly of Chicago and Orange County. And, as DeWald says, 
"Most of the chairs are in place." 
</P>
<P>
They and their wives -- Carolyn Carter, Dorie Pinola and Carolyn DeWald -- were 
definitely the centerpieces of the thank-you party Esther Wachtell, president 
of the Music Center, and the troops hosted the other evening -- dinner in the 
Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and "Phantom of the Opera" at the 
Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 200 couldn't wait for the show. "This is the fourth time 
we've seen 'Phantom' -- London, New York and opening night," said John 
Grundhofer (vice chairman, Wells Fargo Bank), grabbing brownies with wife 
Beverly for the walk across the Plaza to the theater. He'll become a vice 
chairman of the campaign with James Thomas (of Maguire, Thomas), taking over 
from John E. Bryson (executive vice president, Southern California Edison) and 
Roger A. Kozberg (vice president, Johnson &amp; Higgins). 
</P>
<P>
Everyone dined heartily on Chinese pork dumplings and roast beef sandwiches, 
stamina for the emotions of "Phantom." It was a happy crowd: Latham Williams 
and his mother Joan, Kenneth and Linda Docter, Robert and Debra Egelston, 
Stuart and Carrie Ketchum, Nancy and Alan Livingston, Frances Muir, Sydney and 
Jackie Rosenberg, Marlene Billington and Deborah and Tom Tellefsen. 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL WINDS: Quite a group of Diadames accepted Nancy and Corwin Denny's 
invitation to visit their Teton Pines resort at Jackson, Wyo. Art and Lois 
Linkletter were among those on the Snake River float trip, admiring the moose 
and eagles; Mary Davis and Margaret Spillane opted for the white-water trip. 
Louise and John Goode and Midge and Bob Clark trekked to Yellowstone. Diane and 
Robert Anderson, Julie and Bill Bergin, Joni and Clark Smith, Emily and Andrew 
Westham, Mary and Stuart Davis, Donald and Mary Lou Hicks, Kay and Tom McKay, 
Mary and Charles Skouras, Sue and Tom Somermeier, Marcia Adams and John Hessel 
hit the golf course, tennis courts and Jackson Hole art galleries . . . 
</P>
<P>
The French Consul for Cultural Affairs Alexandre Tolstoi, great grand nephew of 
Count Leo Tolstoi, is off on a new assignment to Istanbul, Turkey, with his 
wife Nicole and daughters Natacha and Tania... 
</P>
<P>
Stacy and Piero Salvaggio and Leonard Pennario were in the crowd for the Del 
Mar Race Track's opening week. 
</P>
<P>
GET ENERGIZED: Take a deep breath. You'll need it for fall. September will be 
especially heavy. The Palos Verdes Peninsula people -- Jean Juell, president of 
the Peninsula Committee of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, and Marion 
Scharffenberger, Joan Hanley, Jody Murdock and Robin Serfass -- clued us in 
over a luncheon at the California Club on the 32nd annual Portuguese Bend 
National Horse Show to be held Sept. 8-10 at the Empty Saddle Club in Rolling 
Hills Estates. They're talking about "jumping hurdles for children," a catchy 
phrase to promote their top-rated equestrian event. Funds will endow a 
pediatric cardiology chair at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, organizers are recruiting everyone from their kids to elders to 
staff booths, drive tractors, park cars, sell ads, recruit patrons, design 
brochures, paint fences and scrub portapotties. Show chairwoman Ann Cullen 
expects that by the finale, they will have logged 14,000 volunteer hours. 
</P>
<P>
CIRCLE RED: The trustees of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. have set the 
zoorifically casual Beastly Ball for Sept. 9 . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center Foundation's big fund-raiser will be 
at Filmland Nov. 5 (top donors got recognition at a dinner at the Bel-Air home 
of John and Chantal Kilroy). Lucie Arnaz will entertain and developers Don and 
Ray Watt, foundation directors, hope for a $100,000 net . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteer League of the San Fernando Valley fall benefit, "An Evening Under 
the Stars," at the Universal Amphitheatre with the Pointer Sisters and alfresco 
dining for community service projects is planned for Sept. 9. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Holy Cross Medical Center "Celebration '89" dinner dance will be held at 
San Fernando Mission Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To Goldie Hawn, who's said yes to be the honoree for the Big Sisters 
Guild third annual comedy gala "Alive with Second City" Dec. 9 at the Hollywood 
Palladium. A special merit award will be given to the Krok Sisters -- Arlene, 
Sharon Krok Feuer and Loren -- whose company, EPI Products, has donated 
$100,000 to underwrite the show. 
</P>
<P>
DEBS: Gretchen Schlegel, Patricia Hadfield and Rosemary LaLonde chaired the 
mother-daughter debutante announcement luncheon hosted by the Coronet Debutante 
Ball Board at the Bel Air Country Club. Pink was the color of the day -- pink 
dresses, pink tablecloths, pink carnations, pink coronets. The ball is Nov. 25.

change color and puts to rest that old wives' tale about Jack Frost being 
responsible for the brilliance of autumn colors. The guide advises that the

into the first week of October in northern New Hampshire, with colors peaking 
in southern New Hampshire between Oct. 5 and 15.

ONE KENNEBUNKPORT SUMMER VISITOR ALWAYS GETS PRESIDENTIAL TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB PAYNE, Payne is a free-lance writer living in Milton, Mass. 
</P>

<P>
KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you can't decide what to order at Mabel's Lobster Claw restaurant you can 
always go with the baked stuffed lobster and peanut butter ice cream pie that 
the President of the United States had when he was last there. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you are having trouble making up your mind in the Port Jewelry store, you 
might want to look at a gold cross with a chain similar to the one Barbara Bush 
bought recently. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you are uncertain about how to satisfy your desire for fast action, you 
could ask to see a remote-control model speedboat like the one George Bush 
bought for himself when he visited the Golden Goose Toy Shop a while back. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush family has been summering here for so long, there's hardly a shop or 
restaurant in town they haven't been in," said Ann Livermore, proprietor of the 
House of Brass, where "just the other day Barbara Bush stopped by to pick out 
some gifts while the President was across the street renting a movie at Port 
Video." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Summer Visitor' 
</P>
<P>
There is also hardly a shop or restaurant among this coastal resort town's 75 
shops and 40 or so restaurants and inns where you can't hear a firsthand story 
about the man who has been referred to in a local editorial as, "One of our 
summer visitors who recently landed a good job in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Not that there weren't good stories about Kennebunkport even before visitors 
started asking directions to the then-vice president's spectacularly sited and 
easily viewed ocean-front home out on Walker's Point. (So easily viewed, in 
fact, that the Secret Service considers it a security headache.) 
</P>
<P>
One of several small communities, including Kennebunk, that are known 
collectively as the Kennebunks, Kennebunkport's first claim to fame was as a 
shipbuilding port. 
</P>
<P>
During the 19th Century the Kennebunks turned out about 800 vessels and became 
prosperous enough to foster such extravagances as the Wedding Cake House, a 
truly gaudy and still-standing private home. It serves as an excellent example 
of why some men should not be allowed to choose gifts for their wives. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1800s the shipbuilding industry in Kennebunkport had died of 
a common ailment known as "getting squeezed out by the big guys." 
</P>
<P>
But it had already been replaced by another industry that was to prove 
lucrative in its own right -- catering to summer visitors, many of whom found 
the rugged New England coast and the small-town New England life so much to 
their liking that they built elegant vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
One such visitor was George Herbert Walker, President Bush's maternal 
grandfather. In 1902 he built a "cottage," as well-to-do New Englanders tend to 
call their many-roomed summer mansions, on a rocky promontory now known as 
Walker's Point. Since the day Bush was elected President it has become more 
commonly known as the Summer White House. 
</P>
<P>
The shops have arrays of such presidential memorabilia as post cards, T-shirts, 
coffee mugs, beach towels, tote bags, baseball caps, books, medals, paintings, 
Christmas ornaments and -- rumored to be coming soon -- presidential pizza. 
</P>
<P>
At a gift shop called "What's in Store" you can buy a pair of bedroom slippers 
that have a puppet-size likeness of Bush sitting astride one foot, and Mrs. 
Bush -- complete with pearls -- sitting astride the other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Framed Letter 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Cotton Co. offers a George Bush T-shirt just like the one hanging 
on the wall above a framed letter that says "Love the design -- George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Another letter from the President is displayed at the Zamboanga gift shop, 
where you can get a plaque, made from genuine weathered barn board, that's 
shaped like the state of Maine and features in its collage of Maine attractions 
a likeness of George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At all but the few art galleries and studios whose proprietors will show you to 
the door for even suggesting that they might be influenced by what the public 
wants, you will find that Walker's Point is a popular subject for drawings, 
watercolors and oil paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Even more popular in many shops are the "kinder, gentler" George Bush masks on 
which are printed a warning that says they are not to be worn by small children 
or Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even the possibility, when a neighbor asks how your vacation went, of being 
able to slip on a George Bush mask and say, "Read my lips," hardly compares to 
a better one: That's when you found a great little restaurant where you were 
waited on by the same waitress who served the President of the United States . 
. . and you left her a bigger tip. 
</P>
<P>
Coming home from Kennebunkport with firsthand stories about Bush is relatively 
easy. Simply go into a likely looking shop (the most likely are those with a 
signed photograph on the wall) and, while acting as if you are thinking about 
buying something, casually ask if the President has ever been in. 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is "yes," and if you are polite and patient and continue to act 
as if you might buy something, you are liable to hear a good yarn about his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
You might hear, for instance, how Bush has a tendency to tell the same jokes he 
told on his previous visit. Or how until shopkeepers got used to the Secret 
Service men who precede Mrs. Bush into a store, they assumed that the very 
out-of-place-looking characters were there to rob them. 
</P>
<P>
Or you might hear -- in fact, you can just about count on hearing -- who is 
going to win the presidential election in 1992.

HER WORLD: EXPLAINING THE BARN BARRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New Englander walked into my California home, glanced around -- upstairs 
and down -- and said: "I had no idea you were so crazy for barns." 
</P>
<P>
I did not deny it, but how could he know? My house is modern. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at your art," he went on. "There are barns in every room." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a barn in the background of an acrylic landscape of the lesser 
Andrew Wyeth sort, a barn that was only incidental. He pounced on a large 
mixed-media work that featured a stark white horse barn with empty windows -- a 
work I had bought on an autumn afternoon in Woods Hole, Mass., while waiting 
for a ferry to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
He led me to an oil painting by a Polish artist, which I thought of as a wintry 
study of barren trees and angles, a moody work in whites, browns and blacks. I 
found it at a gallery in Geneva. Sure enough, there is a building in it, but I 
swear it's a cottage. 
</P>
<P>
His next target was a sand casting by Charles Faust of San Diego, an ethereal 
white-on-white work that I treasure for its abstract roots and full moon. Yes, 
there's a hint of a structure on the folds of sand. 
</P>
<P>
Finally the New Englander pointed to a small wooden object the size of a rural 
postbox, a work of gleaming pear wood and cherry that stands on round brass 
feet. "That obviously is a barn -- a carved, toy barn." 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong," I said stubbornly. "That is a doghouse -- an antique French doghouse 
that I bought in Asprey's in London on Christmas Eve and paid far too much for 
and have never regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled at my mad confession. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while my friend saw some barns that weren't there, his premise was 
correct: I love barns and covered bridges and autumn leaves. And I love seeing 
them together along the byways of New England. 
</P>
<P>
The most awesome barn I've visited is the 1826 Shaker masterpiece in Hancock 
Village, just outside Pittsfield in western Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
This round stone barn is bigger than life, rising in simple glory amid rolling 
hills. The functional beauty of its architecture meant that wagons entered the 
vast top level to empty hay into a central haymow. Stables radiated from a 
manger at mid-level so that one person could feed the herd. Manure pits were 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock was an active Shaker community from 1781 to 1960; now it is a museum 
village that tells the story of the "Shaking Quakers" who came to America from 
England and practiced communal living and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
There are barns for all seasons in New England, but autumn is my favorite time 
to ramble along those roads. 
</P>
<P>
Golden birch leaves were splattering down as I drove into Brattleboro, Vt., and 
saw a grand old barn of rain-darkened wood. Light streamed from its open doors 
and from the hayloft above. 
</P>
<P>
This, for me, was Vermont: substantial, proud, inviting. I slowed in the dusk 
to read the sign: FITNESS BARN. Inside were shiny exercise bikes and 
body-building machines. So much for fat cows and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
New England's graceful barns house more than stock or feed, tractors or trucks. 
Some have become country stores fragrant with apples, maple syrup and 
extra-sharp Vermont Cheddar cheese. Others have been restored and converted as 
restaurants, wayside inns, doctors' or dentists' offices, craft centers and 
antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate spiffed-up model is The Inn at Sawmill Farm near West Dover, Vt. 
With hand-hewn timbers and a decorator's flair, it is a place of studied 
elegance. With swimming pool, skiing and golf nearby, it seems more country 
club than country. 
</P>
<P>
Barns have been turned into weekend homes and studios for artists, sculptors 
and violin makers. The pale sun glints on skylights and solar panels atop 
pitched roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The New Hampshire town of North Conway has a pleasant setting east of the 
streams and the green and crimson forests along Kancamagus Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But scenery is not what brings visitors by the busload. North Conway's streets 
are chockablock with factory outlets that offer brand-name discount 
merchandise. One of the brighter cut-rate clusters is called the Red Barn. 
</P>
<P>
Last October at the Old Tavern Inn of Grafton, Vt., a Colonial hostelry of 
immense charm and high-back rocking chairs, I had two questions: 
</P>
<P>
First, where were some good hiking paths? Answer: Try the cross-country ski 
trails of winter. 
</P>
<P>
Second, where was a public telephone? 
</P>
<P>
The woman at the reception desk pointed over her shoulder and smiled. "The 
phone's in the barn." 
</P>
<P>
But of course. And so is the taproom.

A SOUND SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Marton is a great writer ("A Scandalous Tour of Washington," July 16), 
but did he really take this tour? I doubt it or else he sat in the first row. I 
read this in The Times and immediately booked for Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is great and the performances looked like they might be fun, if you 
could hear them. The acoustics were so bad on the bus, so distorted that one 
was forced to listen so hard that one did not have time to listen for the 
scandal. Too bad because the idea is great. We took two guests from D.C. and 
they could have sent many more folks. My advice is to save yourself $46 each 
and just read and enjoy the article in the paper.

LAHAINA, Maui 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Hawaii's capital was moved to Honolulu in 1843 it was at lovely Lahaina 
on beautiful Maui Island. This port town was the center of Hawaiian culture and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today, adored by natives and tourists alike, Lahaina retains its charming 
turn-of-the-century architecture and ambience. It has been given landmark 
status and historic buildings are gradually being restored and refurbished. 
Without losing one bit of charm, Lahaina is becoming one of Hawaii's most 
popular tourist destinations. 
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the Hawaiian Islands' best shopping stops. Best buys include 
casual and sports clothing with tropical styling, chic personal accessories and 
fabulous local art, jewelry and other handcrafts. 
</P>
<P>
Lahaina's biggest concentration of shops is near the waterfront along Front 
Street (less formally known as the strip) in a stretch of about eight blocks 
between Hotel Street (near the famous Pioneer Inn and Lahaina Small Boat 
Harbor) and Papalaua Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Browse the Strip 
</P>
<P>
Begin browsing the strip on Hotel Street, where shops include the incomparable 
Defense D'Afficher (No. 5). This French shop is a must for T-shirt enthusiasts. 
Instead of typical Hawaiian souvenir slogans and such, Defense D'Afficher 
decorates its T-shirts ($31 and up) with lovely drawings based on a 1920s 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
There are darling flappers and dashing racing cars. Sweat shirts ($65 and up) 
are similarly decorated and slacks and other casual clothing are designed to 
coordinate well with the theme. 
</P>
<P>
On Front Street, Wholesale Eelskin (No. 505) sells fashions and accessories 
made of exotic leather at reasonable prices. Available are womens' low- or 
high-heeled pumps in snake or eel skin for $59 and men's shoes for $90. 
</P>

$400. Roomy eelskin carry-ons cost $165, wallets are from $25 and coin purses

your future. 
</P>
<P>
Wyland Galleries Hawaii's two locations (Nos. 697 and 711) are good sources for 
Hawaiian ocean theme art, including artist/owner Robert Wyland's undersea 
pictures of whales and dolphins. Also sold there are Maui artist Andrew 
Annenberg's underwater surrealist paintings (about $70,000), which are best 
viewed under black light for their full effect of neon colors and creatures 
more easily missed with regular light. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Joseph Evers' bronze sculptures and fountain pieces are of playful 
porpoises, whales and other sea animals. A monumental wooden hanging sculpture 
of a whale costs $12,500; gold porpoise and whale pendants on chains are $143.

assortment of pretty pastels or blaring tropical colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

TRIP OF THE WEEK: A ROARING RIDE THROUGH REDWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM, The Grimms are Laguna Beach free-lance 
writers/photographers and authors of the updated Away for a Weekend. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FELTON, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The train whistles that echo through the redwood forest here bring visitors 
back to the 1800s, when sturdy little steam engines hauled carloads of timber 
down from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the historic locomotives are carrying sightseers up the steep 
grades to view virgin stands of Sequoia sempervirens, the tallest species of 
trees in the world. Just hop aboard the Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees 
Narrow-Gauge Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The one-of-a-kind railway makes a scenic 12-mile round-trip journey beneath a 
canopy of coastal redwoods in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The excursion takes 
about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but you can get off to picnic in the woods and 
then catch a later train back to the depot. 
</P>
<P>
The Roaring Camp station is seven miles north of Santa Cruz in this rural town 
that was named after a lawyer, Charles Felton, who later became a U.S. 
congressman and senator. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,800 acres of the adjacent forest have been preserved as Henry Cowell 
Redwoods State Park, where you can explore 20 miles of trails and camp among 
the evergreens. The park also has a nature display center and a riverside 
picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican Land Grant 
</P>
<P>
The redwoods were part of a Mexican land grant, Rancho Canada del Rincon. Some 
of them came into the possession of a boisterous Kentucky mountain man, Isaac 
Graham, who established a rough-and-tumble place called Roaring Camp. 
</P>
<P>
After his death, loggers wanted the property, but Joseph Welch, a San Francisco 
businessman, bought the land to protect the big trees. 
</P>
<P>
However, the lumbermen succeeded in getting right-of-way through Welch's 
redwoods and built a narrow-gauge railroad from Felton to Santa Cruz in 1875. 
Later, a connecting line was added from San Jose over the mountains, and 
tourists by the train load came from San Francisco to see the awesome trees. 
</P>
<P>
Welch operated a rustic resort for visitors to his Big Trees Grove, where some 
redwoods tower more than 250 feet. After his death a portion of the property 
became a county park. In 1954 it was absorbed into a state park, with 
surrounding land donated by the Henry Cowell family. 
</P>
<P>
Another section of Welch's untouched forest was later leased by his descendants 
so that the old narrow-gauge railway could get up steam again. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the dreams and determination of a Los Angeles train buff, the late F. 
Norman Clark, Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees RR made its debut in 1963. More than 
250,000 people now ride the old-time trains annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derelict Engines 
</P>
<P>
Get here from Los Angeles by driving U.S. 101 and California 1 north to Santa 
Cruz, then exiting north on River Street/California 9 to Felton. Turn right on 
Graham Hill Road and go about a half mile to the right-hand entrance to Roaring 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a century-old depot awaiting restoration, and a train yard filled 
with derelict engines and rail cars. After reaching the parking lot ($3 on 
weekends in the summer; free at other times), walk through the covered bridge 
and past a duck pond to the ticket office at trackside. 
</P>
<P>
Excursions depart at 11 a.m., 12:15, 1:30, 2:45 and 4 p.m. daily through Labor 
Day, Sept. 4. The same schedule applies on weekends and holidays through the 
rest of September, but on weekdays the only departure is at noon. No 
reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year trains depart at noon, 1:30 and 3 p.m. on weekends 
and holidays, plus a noon run on weekdays. Christmas Day is the only time that 
the railroad doesn't operate. 
</P>
<P>
Round-trip fares are $10.50; ages 5 through 17 pay $7.50. The ride is free for 
children under 5. Call (408) 335-4400 (recording) or (408) 335-4484 for 
additional information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Squeal of the Wheels 
</P>
<P>
If the train is returning from a trip, you'll hear its whistle and the squeal 
of wheels on the tracks as it descends through the trees. Listen for the roar 
of escaping steam as the engine is "blown down" to keep pressure from getting 
too high in the boiler. 
</P>
<P>
While passengers climb aboard for the next excursion, the spout of an 
old-fashioned water tower is pulled down to refill the engine. Then the steam 
whistle blows and the train circles a grassy meadow before huffing and puffing 
to get up some of the steepest railroad grades in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the railroad's steam locomotives are being used -- a 1910 Shay called 
Sonora and an 1899 Heisler named Tuolumne. They pull four open-top cars with 
bench seats and a covered car at the rear. Passengers needn't worry about soot 
from the smoke stack because the old engines burn oil instead of coal. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals set fire to a corkscrew trestle several years ago, so the train must 
stop to back up into a siding that switches to a spur and bypasses the burned 
section of track. As the train crawls up the mountainside the conductor tells 
the history of the Roaring Camp railroad and describes the tree-filled scenery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ring of Redwoods 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is invited to get off at Cathedral Grove to stand in a ring of 
towering redwoods and hear about the tree's life cycle. The conductor also 
talks about its relatives -- the giant Sequoia in the Sierra Nevada and the 
dawn redwood in China. 
</P>
<P>
If you've brought food and drink you can disembark at Bear Mountain to picnic. 
The train trip up to the picnic area takes about 50 minutes, while the downhill 
ride over the same tracks gets you back to the depot in just 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
From Roaring Camp you also can depart on the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific 
Railway Co. diesel train, which began excursions to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in 
1987. Two round trips are made daily through Labor Day, then only weekends and 
holidays through Oct. 29. Tickets are $16 (weekdays $12), children $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
You can browse in the Roaring Camp General Store for railroad books and 
souvenirs. Visitors also hiss and boo villains during melodrama shows presented 
three times daily on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toasted Marshmallows 
</P>
<P>
A chuck-wagon barbecue is available from noon to 3 p.m. on weekends through 
October. The menu ($7.95 to $13.95) features charbroiled hamburgers, chicken, 
ribs and steaks, plus salad, beans, beverages and marshmallows to toast on the 
campfire. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the tracks a path leads into the state park and mile-long Redwood 
Grove Trail. Pick up a self-guiding leaflet to the giant trees that have been 
named for U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
You can reach the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park campground and its 112 sites 
by driving south on Graham Hill Road. Make reservations through Mistix by 
calling toll-free (800) 444-7275. The reservation fee is $3.95, plus $10 a 
night (no hookups for RVs). 
</P>
<P>
For information about lodgings and restaurants in the area, call the Santa Cruz 
County Conference and Visitors Council at (408) 425-1234. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Felton and Roaring Camp railroad through the 
redwoods is 760 miles.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: WHY FREQUENT FLIERS ARE FREQUENTLY DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks ago, having accumulated more than 90,000 miles in the TWA 
frequent-flier program, I decided to reward myself with a "free" trip to 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
I called the toll-free number at the TWA frequent flier award desk. I confirmed 
that I did indeed qualify for the European trip. But when I then called the TWA 
reservation number to book my flight I was told that there were no seats 
available for London. 
</P>
<P>
"How about the next day?" I asked. Negative. And there were no seats for the 
following day. In fact, according to the TWA reservations agent, there might 
not be any seats available until October. 
</P>
<P>
October? I redialed the TWA reservation number, did not identify myself as 
someone attempting to redeem a mileage award and asked if seats were available 
to London on my original flight date. 
</P>
<P>
They were. And seats were also available on every other date I selected. What 
had happened? I had become the latest victim in the frequent flier award 
redemption Catch-22: You can win the award, but you may not be able to use it 
at your convenience. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight years since they began, frequent flier programs have become 
probably the most popular marketing tool ever created by the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt that the individual programs have built passenger loyalty, but 
the big question is whether they are rewarding it. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are that you've never heard of the Hope Letter. Lately, the document 
has been circulating among certain travel agents angered about what they 
consider to be frequent flier program abuses by airlines, and a copy found its 
way to my desk. 
</P>
<P>
It was a letter authored by Robert Hurd, American Airlines' managing director 
of general accounting. The bulk of the letter addressed how American 
financially accounted for its frequent flier "Advantage" program. 
</P>
<P>
But in one revealing paragraph Hurd described American's philosophy about the 
redemption of mileage awards. 
</P>
<P>
"In a frequent-flier program," he wrote last January, "the most that is offered 
to a FFP member is the hope that they will in some way benefit from the 
program. They must hope that they will take enough trips to earn an award. They 
must hope that the program doesn't cease before enough miles are accumulated 
for an award. 
</P>
<P>
"The FFP member must hope that American will not have blocked usage of travel 
awards at the time they would like to use the award. And they must hope that 
American doesn't change the number of miles needed to earn an award." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd's Hope Letter seems to state the situation precisely for all airlines and 
their frequent flier program members. Indeed, not a week goes by without this 
column receiving letters of complaint by frequent fliers who have experienced 
similar frustrations trying to redeem airline, hotel or rent-a-car awards 
earned with airline miles. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago many airlines -- trying to limit the large mileage liability 
they had incurred -- tried to change eligibility and mileage requirements for 
trip awards. Suddenly a trip for two to Hawaii, which had once required 75,000 
miles, would only be rewarded at 90,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent fliers were incensed. Some of them, who just happened to be lawyers, 
filed class action lawsuits against some of the airlines, including United. 
</P>
<P>
In the United case the airline was charged with breach of contract. Other 
awards were also affected. A mileage award of a cruise, once redeemable for 
150,000 miles, had doubled to 300,000 miles. TWA, which tried to limit who 
could use a mileage award, was also sued. 
</P>
<P>
The airline required that people who earned frequent flier awards had to use 
the tickets themselves or give them to a relative with the same last name. TWA 
was sued by a homosexual couple who claimed that the program discriminated 
against them. United settled the suit two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
And in July TWA announced a change in policy that now allows its frequent 
fliers to use their mileage awards with companions of their own choosing. In 
the United suit the airline agreed to reverse its earlier action and permit its 
"mileage plus" members to claim mileage awards under the old rules. 
</P>
<P>
A group of state attorneys general also got into the act, and issued a mandate 
that forced airlines to give frequent fliers at least a year's notice before 
changing mileage level and redemption rules. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that the lawsuit settlements, coupled with the mandate, would 
have made things better. Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the airlines did roll back the mileage levels. And yes, the airlines now 
give 12 months' notice for rule changes. But that hasn't made getting a mileage 
award flight any easier. 
</P>
<P>
Why? In the case of United, while it did reverse its earlier decision to raise 
mileage award levels, it did other things as well . . . none of them in your 
best interests. For starters, United shortened to six months (from one year) 
the period in which an award certificate must be used. It also changed 
upgrading procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers can no longer use an upgrade certificate to fly first-class if they 
are traveling on a heavily discounted coach ticket. And last but not least, 
United began heavy "capacity controls." What this means is that the airline has 
severely limited the number of seats on each flight that can be used by 
redeeming frequent flier awards. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, United isn't alone. Just about every airline has begun strict 
capacity controls. 
</P>
<P>
How do you beat the airlines at their own games? Approach the frequent flier 
programs the way you would handle the consumer indifference you'd expect from 
any other large public utility. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not satisfied with the responses you get, ask to speak to a 
supervisor, and then to speak to the supervisor's supervisor. In each frequent 
flier program there is someone who can help you, especially in cases of 
capacity control and in cases where the flier had accumulated an impressive 
number of miles. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this isn't a solution to the bigger problem. The U.S. Department of 
Transportation is investigating airline frequent flier programs. And other 
lawsuits, challenging the airlines' policy of blackouts and capacity controls, 
are pending. Stay tuned.

HOW TO ENJOY FALL FOLIAGE AND MISS THE CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM A. DAVIS, Davis is travel editor of the Boston Globe. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are almost as many ways to see New England's fall foliage as there are 
leaves on its trees. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, leaf peeping is much more enjoyable if you avoid the crowds. And 
the best way to do that is not to travel on weekends and other peak times, and 
to stay off the most popular foliage routes. Or, at least, not to travel 
exclusively on them. 
</P>
<P>
But, you ask, won't that mean a foliage experience that, while perhaps less 
stressful, is also less scenic? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Foliage is usually at or near its best over a wide and scenic area of western 
Massachusetts, and southern New Hampshire and Vermont during the Columbus Day 
weekend (Oct. 7-9). This is the time when roads in foliage country are jammed, 
and country inns usually booked. 
</P>
<P>
But the foliage also happens to be good in this area well before that weekend, 
and continues for some time afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In southern New England -- Rhode Island and Connecticut -- leaves may just be 
starting to turn on Columbus Day, while in the northernmost part of the region, 
colors will already have faded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiny Towns 
</P>
<P>
New England's largest foliage festival takes place in North Adams, Mass. This 
year it's set for Sept. 30 to Oct. 1. The first foliage festival will be in the 
tiny neighboring Vermont towns of Victory and Granby, Sept. 23-24. 
</P>
<P>
The two towns have only 150 people between them, but their gorgeous scenery and 
down-home doings usually attract about 10,000 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During the following weekend, some of the prettiest villages in Vermont's rural 
and unspoiled northeastern corner -- Peacham, Barnet and Cabot -- participate 
in the Northeast Kingdom Foliage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
New England's most popular foliage routes are the Mohawk Trail, the western 
stretch of Massachusetts 2 from Greenfield to the New York line, and Vermont 
100 and 9 in the southern part of the state. These are scenic highways that are 
very crowded in season, while roads paralleling or crossing them are just as 
pretty but far less busy. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts 2A, for example, is a winding alternate to 2 that, in its middle 
stretches, passes through some beautiful, quintessentially Yankee central 
Massachusetts towns. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite high-season foliage drives is through the gorge of the 
Deerfield River, along a local road that runs from the little town of Zoar, 
Mass., to Readsboro, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road Less Crowded 
</P>
<P>
Steep hills, festooned with colors like medieval banners, hang over this road, 
which follows the west bank of the river and connects the Mohawk Trail with 
Vermont 100. It is at least as scenic as the two major roads, but rarely 
crowded. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut River forms the boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire, and 
its valley is dotted with handsome villages and New England's greatest 
concentration of superb Federal Era architecture. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. 5 on the Vermont side and New Hampshire 10 traverse scenic stretches of 
what is called the Upper Valley of the Connecticut, a region so distinct that 
it once attempted to form a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire 10 passes through Hanover, home of Dartmouth College, and Orford, 
a jewel of a river village with a lineup of gleaming white federal mansions. 
</P>
<P>
The more adventurous foliage viewer, one who wants to really escape the crowds, 
should consider driving a stretch of third-class or unpaved road. It helps to 
get local advice before trying one, however. And they shouldn't be traversed in 
bad weather or with a low-slung car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough to Book 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite dirt roads in early foliage season is the Stannard Road, 
which runs from Lyndonville to Greensboro Bend in northeastern Vermont. Well 
maintained although unpaved for much of its length, the road passes over 
Wheelock Mountain, with its splendid views, and through the lonely, lovely 
hamlets of South Wheelock and Stannard. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations can be a problem in particularly popular foliage regions -- 
southern Vermont, the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, the Monadnock Region 
of New Hampshire -- and advance reservations are recommended throughout the 
season. They are essential around Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
However, Vermont is particularly helpful about finding beds for leafers without 
reservations, and many Green Mountain towns have a policy of putting visitors 
into hospitable private homes when nothing else is available. Among the 
chambers of commerce providing this service are: Addison County Chamber Travel 
Bureau, Middlebury, (802) 388-7951; St. Johnsbury Chamber of Commerce, (802) 
748-3678, and the Woodstock Area Chamber of Commerce, (802) 453-3555. 
</P>
<P>
Driving may be the preferred method of transportation for looking at autumn 
leaves, but there are other options. 
</P>
<P>
The Providence and Worcester Railroad, exclusively a freight carrier most of 
the year, runs special foliage passenger trains over a scenic central 
Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island route on weekends until mid-October. 
For information, call (508) 755-4000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sky View 
</P>
<P>
Those who have experienced it maintain that foliage looks most beautiful -- 
something like a psychedelic stained-glass window laid end to end -- when seen 
from above while slowly, silently floating in a hot-air balloon. 
</P>
<P>
The Balloon School of Massachusetts in Palmer offers flights over the 
Berkshires throughout the foliage season. Flights usually take place at dawn, 
when there is little wind, and last one to two hours. For more information, 
call (413) 245-7013. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking is a healthy and rewarding way to get good foliage views. Mt. Monadnock 
in New Hampshire may be the most-climbed peak in the country, if not the world, 
rivaling Japan's Mt. Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
On a good fall foliage weekend, the main trail up Monadnock is about as jammed 
as the Mohawk Trail. There are well-marked alternative routes, however, and the 
smashing view makes the effort worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Many ski areas operate their chairlifts and gondolas during the fall, providing 
colorful panoramas on the way up or down. Mt. Tom in Holyoke, Mass., has a 
splendid view of the Connecticut Valley. Call (413) 536-0516. 
</P>
<P>
A tramway runs up Jay Peak in Jay, Vt., (802) 988-2611, and the panorama from 
the summit takes in the Northeast Kingdom and Eastern Townships areas of 
Quebec, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The historic tramway at Cannon Mountain in Franconia, N.H., (603) 823-7751, 
first of its type in the country, offers wonderful vistas of the White 
Mountains, New England's tallest range.

AT HOME: IN IRVINE: IRVINE, WHERE NOT MUCH IS LEFT TO CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
ORDERLY GROWTH WITH CONSISTENT ARCHITECTURE, OPEN SPACE AND LOTS OF ROOM TO DO 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, Wiles is a free-lance writer from Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To get an idea of how fast Irvine has grown, think back to the late 1960s. 
Orange County was already big enough to support a major league baseball team 
and Disneyland, but Irvine didn't even have a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Early residents such as Mary Lou and Ed Chavez, who moved into the area from 
Laguna Beach in 1966, had to drive to Corona del Mar, Tustin or Costa Mesa for 
groceries, and they couldn't take the San Diego Freeway, because it hadn't yet 
been extended through the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite an event in our lives when we finally got a store and a gas 
station," recalled Mary Lou, a retired elementary school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Irvine has its share of supermarkets, gas stations and other trappings 
of development. The population stands at about 100,000, up from 62,000 in 1980. 
During a stretch in the '70s and early '80s, Irvine was the state's 
fastest-growing city. And there's more to come: By the turn of the century, 
planners estimate the city will have 225,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earned National Reputation 
</P>
<P>
The city's business development has been equally impressive. Already, four of 
Orange County's six largest publicly held companies call Irvine home. More 
firms are being lured to the Irvine Spectrum, an ambitious business park now 
taking shape at the junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has earned a national reputation as a carefully thought-out city. A 
zealous master plan has kept growth orderly and property values rising. But 
critics see in the greenbelts and consistent architecture a community sapped of 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
An article in The Washington Post last year complained that Irvine "is a place 
with no possibility of surprise, or chance, no spontaneous diversity." The 
story loosely compared the city with the Stepford wives -- "perfect in a 
horrifying sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
Residents bristle at such criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who write that Irvine has no character come from places with 
billboards, junkyards and body shops, and they're trying to rationalize why 
they live where they do," said Joyce Birdwell, a senior engineering designer at 
Printronix Inc., an Irvine-based firm that builds computer printers. 
</P>
<P>
Birdwell first heard about the city in the mid-'80s while living in Houston, 
and what she heard was mostly positive. She moved to Irvine about three years 
ago after a short stay in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Ed DeLeonardis, a radiologist who grew up in Glendale, moved to Irvine with his 
wife and three children four years ago. He concedes that Irvine has a 
reputation problem with certain outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban on Billboards 
</P>
<P>
"Some people go out of their way to put down Irvine as a place full of yuppies 
and status-oriented people," DeLeonardis said. "But I don't think Irvine's all 
that different from other areas with similar income levels." 
</P>
<P>
If Irvine looks homogenous, it's because of the planning and zoning controls. 
Besides banning billboards, the city makes sure that television antennas are 
kept out of sight and telephone lines underground. Irvine has numerous parks, 
and nearly every boulevard has landscaping, which helps hide gas stations and 
other unsightly business establishments. 
</P>
<P>
In most neighborhoods people can't paint their homes an unapproved color or 
keep a recreation vehicle parked for long on the street. 
</P>
<P>
These measures and features have come in response to the blight created in 
other Southern California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Safeguards have been put in regarding landscaping and traffic so that you 
don't have billboards and harsh streetscapes, as in a lot of older areas," 
DeLeonardis said. Most Irvine residents seem to accept these restrictions as a 
way to keep property values up. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid growth of the past two decades, Irvine still has plenty of 
crop land interspersed among developments. This open space harks back to the 
area's agricultural origin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold Rush Merchant 
</P>
<P>
In 1864, four men, led by James Irvine -- a Scots-Irish immigrant who had 
become a successful San Francisco merchant during the Gold Rush -- purchased 
parts of three Spanish-Mexican land grants and used the property to raise 
sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, Irvine bought out his partners. In 1894, his son, J. I. 
Irvine, incorporated this land into the Irvine Co. and started to shift the 
focus to crop production. 
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, a settlement of tenant farmers had taken root in 
what's now the eastern part of town, near where Sand Canyon Avenue crosses 
under the Santa Ana Freeway. Several historic buildings, including a lima 
bean-packing plant, have been renovated as part of Old Town Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Irvine Co. continues to lease land to tenant farmers, who grow 
oranges, strawberries, asparagus, bell peppers and other crops in various 
fields scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the pressures of suburbanization, agriculture won't disappear 
entirely from the scene. Last year, the Irvine Co. agreed to transfer 8,000 
acres of open space to the city -- much of it crop land -- in return for 
various development concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still a Bit Isolated' 
</P>
<P>
Residents generally applaud the decision to preserve some open space. 
</P>
<P>
"One unique aspect of Irvine is that we're still a bit isolated," DeLeonardis 
said. Farmland greets motorists coming into the city from either direction on 
the Santa Ana Freeway. "You know when you're entering and leaving town," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Around Turtle Rock, on Irvine's southwestern flank, much of the open land has 
been kept wild. Vicki Weatherhead, a secretary who has lived in Turtle Rock 
with her family since 1975, still spots a variety of wildlife, including 
coyotes and red-tail hawks. 
</P>
<P>
"And we've have quails eating in our back yard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other developed parts of Irvine, Turtle Rock is hilly and relatively 
isolated. Perhaps this explains why some Turtle Rock residents have become so 
tightly knit, Weatherhead said. 
</P>
<P>
On each major holiday, for instance, the people on her street throw a potluck 
block party. On average, about 30 residents and guests show up. "This has been 
going on since before I moved in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Property Prices 
</P>
<P>
Blessed by geography, Turtle Rock has become Irvine's priciest area. The most 
expensive residential properties run about $1 million, according to Ruth 
Jacobs, an agent at ERA-Main Street Realty. That's well above the $306,000 
median price for a detached house in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
On the low end of the city's price scale, a three-bedroom, two-bath house in El 
Camino, a neighborhood near the Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin, can be 
bought for $225,000, Jacobs added. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine condominiums sell for a median price of $158,000. The range is from 
$115,000 for a two-bedroom unit in a development called Orangetree, near Irvine 
Valley College, to $750,000 or so for a four-bedroom view condo in Turtle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, housing prices in Irvine jumped 36% during the 12 months ending last 
May. The rate of increase has since slowed, and properties are staying on the 
market a bit longer, Jacobs said. "There's a lot more inventory than there was 
last year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyers From Outside 
</P>
<P>
Rich Steinhoff, a broker at ERA-Main Street Realty, said the hefty price jumps 
of the recent past have put Irvine out of reach of many first-time buyers. "The 
market is mostly move-up," he said, and the vast majority of buyers come from 
outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Why are people attracted to Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
Residents are quick to recite a checklist of items they like about their city: 
cleanliness, open space, order, an extensive network of bike trails, numerous 
recreational facilities and low crime (the third-safest place in Orange County, 
according to a recent state report). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's public education system also gets high marks. Two high schools 
(Woodbridge and University) have been recognized for excellence in education by 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The people who live in Irvine also boast about -- of all things -- the city's 
growing role as an entertainment center. Top musicians regularly perform at the 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
University Offerings 
</P>
<P>
The acrobatic Blue Angels put on aerial shows at El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station which borders Irvine. Then there's The Improv, one of Orange County's 
few comedy clubs, and Wild Rivers, an aquatic amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, UC Irvine features a steady offering of concerts, plays, speeches 
and sporting events. "Most communities don't have a major university in their 
back yard," DeLeonardis noted. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't always like this. David Howitt, an electrical contractor who 
moved his family down from Santa Barbara in 1971, remembers University High's 
Friday night football games as the main social event in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"You went whether you had kids at the school or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the problems brought by rapid development, longtime residents seem to 
complain about traffic most. The Chavezes still remember when they used to 
drive the length of Culver Drive, Irvine's main drag, without seeing another 
car. Today, motorists can't go far without getting slowed by traffic or the 
many left-hand-turn stoplights on the busy thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caught Off Guard 
</P>
<P>
DeLeonardis believes Irvine's planners have been caught off guard by the 
general increase in vehicular volume. 
</P>
<P>
For example, now that Alton Parkway has been extended to the Saddleback Valley, 
providing commuters from the south with an alternative to the San Diego 
Freeway, surface traffic has increased in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"That has caught some planners and politicians by surprise," said DeLeonardis. 
As a result, he figures that city officials will more carefully scrutinize the 
impact of future road extensions. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro Marine base creates a different sort of problem for residents in 
the eastern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Jets fly out of the base, occasionally at 3 in the morning, and so low that 
the house shakes," said Cathleen Mattie, who rents a condo in the Northwood 
section of Irvine. Even so, Mattie likes the city, and she considers rental 
rates in the area reasonable. "You get a lot more for the money than in Costa 
Mesa," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rule Out Move-Up 
</P>
<P>
Mattie graduated two years ago from Cal State Fullerton, and now works as 
publications coordinator at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. She said 
she would like to buy in Irvine someday but sees a definite affordability 
problem. "Buying isn't in the works right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even some established homeowners don't believe they can afford to trade up in 
Irvine. Birdwell views herself in that situation, despite a large increase in 
the value of her one-bedroom Northwood condo since she purchased it in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely happy about the appreciation, but to sell my unit and buy 
another place in Irvine is totally out of the question," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Howitt and his wife came to the same conclusion, but they decided to take the 
money and move. The Howitts recently sold their home in The Ranch, one of 
Irvine's first neighborhoods, for $272,000. They had paid $33,000 for the 
1,800-square-foot property in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Howitts are moving to Menifee, a new planned community in Riverside County. 
In part, they decided to leave Irvine to cash in on their home's appreciation. 
But also, they want to rediscover the quiet life they once enjoyed in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, Irvine's still a pretty fine city," Howitt said. "But I guess 
you'd call us country people at heart."

COUNSELING CENTER HELPS HOME BUYERS GET LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a first-home buyer and puzzled about some aspect of the loan process 
or if you've been thinking about refinancing your home and need some guidance, 
you may find the answers by calling the Home Loan Counseling Center. 
</P>
<P>
The center provides its services free of charge in what its manager described 
as a "non-intimidating, non-institutionalized meeting place" where qualified 
buyers can be matched with available mortgage money. 
</P>
<P>
It also serves as a clearinghouse on special loan availability, including 
government- and municipal-sponsored programs, home-improvement and 
rehabilitation loans. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977 by members of the savings and loan industry, the center handles 
an average of 500 phone requests a month for home loan process information, and 
its two Los Angeles-based offices interview about 70 loan applicants by 
appointment every month. 
</P>
<P>
"Our role is primarily that of demystifying the home mortgage process for home 
buyers, and we especially encourage single-family, owner-occupied home 
ownership," said Gloria Ancira, office manager and a counselor for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center has two Southland locations: 163 S. Avenue 20, Suite 201, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90031, (213) 224-8011, and 1115 W. Adams Blvd., Suite 106, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90007, (213) 747-0807. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 22 participating associations are Home Federal, American Savings, 
Glendale Federal, Great Western Savings, Home Savings, First Federal Savings, 
Coast Savings, First Nationwide Savings and Gibraltar Savings.

DON'T BLAME CACTUS FOR SLOW SALE OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
To paraphrase Wordsworth: The brokers are too much with us. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing personal, mind you. Our broker happens to be professional and 
hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
But my wife and I have endured a 10-week odyssey into the nerve-wracking world 
of selling a home. We've undergone the pressure of a deadline for a 
cross-country move. We've hawked our house in a market that suddenly, 
maddeningly slowed to a crawl just as we jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
Our modest Sherman Oaks house has brought its share of drama right from escrow. 
Even before we closed on it two years ago, we drove up one day to find two 
young women sawing off branches from the majestic cereus cactus in our front 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought you'd want them removed," they lied. 
</P>
<P>
Stealing our succulents? Was nothing sacred in the Southland? 
</P>
<P>
A job promotion drove us back into the marketplace after months of hearing 
about soaring prices and multiple bids -- the California housing gold rush. 
Even our handyman got nearly $1 million for his grubby Beverly Hills bungalow, 
which the buyer demolished and replaced with an oversized monstrosity on a 
quarter-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waited for Bids 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We listed in early May and waited for the bids to come rolling in. And waited. 
And waited. 
</P>
<P>
"The house shows extremely well," our broker said so often it became a kind of 
mantra. But show was all it did; there was no winning with this place. 
</P>
<P>
As my departure date loomed, we lowered the price and tried not to take it 
personally when battalions of would-be buyers traipsed through our living room 
with nary a bid. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with our house?" my wife lamented. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that a generous offer won't cure," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bells went off, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alarms Routs Clients 
</P>
<P>
We were hiding in Santa Barbara from yet another weekend open house. A friend 
had agreed to turn our alarm on and off (if they'll steal your cactus, why 
would they stop at the stoop?) so brokers could peddle "the property" in our 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
He was late one morning and a broker had arrived with clients, only to be 
driven away by a deafening siren that would not stop. 
</P>
<P>
I called to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients were serious buyers," the broker growled. "They really liked the 
property." 
</P>
<P>
"Surely, they'll come back for another look under quieter circumstances," I 
pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," he replied. "They said they want to see what else was around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Cactus in Back 
</P>
<P>
For 24 hours, my anger at my friend smoldered. Then my broker assured me that 
her colleague was probably extracting retribution; his clients were not 
interested, siren or no, if they failed to return to the scene of the crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
But she did have a suggestion: remove the 8-foot cactuses in the back that were 
more impressive than the ones out front. She said many potential buyers wanted 
a traditional grassy back yard, which we could provide, sans cereus. 
</P>
<P>
Since reluctantly inheriting the prickly desert denizens, we had grown fond of 
their delicate night-blooming flowers, their stoic grandeur and merciful 
self-reliance. The notion of hacking them up for resale was painful. We did not 
want to oversee their demise out back in departing after saving them in front 
upon arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we vowed to take them out if the new owner preferred sod to 
succulents. We lowered the price -- again. We even warmed yeast in the oven to 
create that homey smell of fresh-baked cookies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Like Dating' 
</P>
<P>
And we told ourselves there must be someone who would appreciate what we did 
about our home: the logical layout, the French doors and skylights, the serene 
covered patio, the fountain and roses, and gardenias. And, hopefully, even the 
cactus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like dating," I said. "It only takes one." 
</P>
<P>
That one proved to be a sweet couple seeking more space, a more outdoor life 
style, a place to cultivate orchids and plug in computers. They were spurred to 
quick action -- and a full-price bid -- by another offer that came in the same 
electrifying Sunday. Money Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the cereus seem safe. Our buyers appreciate them, too. 
</P>
<P>
So we're off to the East Coast -- and more brokers. I hope no one takes it 
personally when we tromp through his or her home without buying it. I figure 
we'll know we've found the right place when bells go off. But I'm not promising 
my wife a cactus garden.

REAL ESTATE Q AND A: HOW TO SPOT ANXIOUS HOME SELLER FOR BEST PRICE AND 
FINANCING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I desperately want to buy a home. But we only have 
around $15,000 for the down payment and closing costs. We know that isn't much, 
but we keep hearing about people who buy a home for little or no cash. As we 
are not eligible for a nothing-down VA mortgage, we talked to a lender about 
FHA and 90% financing, but we were turned off by the costs and terms. One of 
our friends recently bought a beautiful home where the seller carried back the 
entire first mortgage for 20 years. Any suggestions how we can find a similar 
deal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The home sale market has slowed down recently in many cities. I think 
the reasons include a softening of economic conditions and many prospective 
home buyers are waiting in hopes that mortgage interest rates might decline 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I suggest you jump in and buy a home from an anxious, motivated home 
seller who must sell. Forget the sellers who are testing the market in hopes 
they might get their outrageous asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
To spot an anxious home seller, look for the obvious signals. First, ask the 
realty agent, "Why is the seller selling?" Some obnoxious agents will reply, 
"It's none of your business." Personally, I refuse to do business with those 
uncooperative agents because it is the buyer's business to know why the seller 
is selling, so the purchase offer can be tailored to meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
Second, get excited when you spot a vacant house for sale. That means the 
seller is probably making mortgage payments on two houses and will listen to 
any reasonable offer. 
</P>
<P>
Third, look for homes being sold by retirees. I find retired people often own 
their homes free and clear, so they can carry back the first mortgage at a 
reasonable interest rate with no loan costs. For example, several years ago I 
bought a rental house from a retired lady who told me the $1,083 monthly 
payment she received from me was more money than she ever earned before. 
</P>
<P>
In today's market, if you offer a seller an interest rate of 9% to 10%, that is 
higher than can be earned on most alternative safe investments. 
</P>
<P>
Insure House for the Cost of Replacement 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently bought a new house. Before buying I called my insurance agent who 
recommended a $94,000 policy. But my mortgage is for $124,500. The lender will 
not accept my $94,000 policy. However, my insurance agent refuses to insure for 
more because he says his company won't write policies for more than the home's 
replacement cost. What should I do? The lender threatens to buy their own 
policy at a cost of $20 per day. 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't let that arrogant lender push you around. You are only required to 
insure the premises for its replacement cost. The amount of the mortgage is 
irrelevant. Ask your insurance agent to contact the lender to educate him that 
insurance replacement cost is all that is required. 
</P>
<P>
In some states, it is illegal to insure for more than the structure's 
replacement cost because over-insurance encourages arson. 
</P>
<P>
Buy Title Insurance for Vacation Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering buying a vacation cabin in a rural county. The realty 
agent seems very anxious to sell it to us. He offered to give us a free "chain 
of title" report. He said we will need it when we get the mortgage. Although my 
wife and I have bought several homes, we have never heard of a chain of title 
report. What is it, and do we really need it? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, you don't need a chain of title report. It is merely a history of the 
property's title from its earliest recorded deed to the present time. While it 
might make interesting reading, a chain of title report is not needed to obtain 
a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But you will need to obtain title insurance for the mortgage lender. Depending 
on local custom, title insurance is either arranged by a local attorney, the 
mortgage lender or by a title insurance or escrow company. Since the property 
is rural, you also may need to obtain a survey to locate the property's 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, when you make a written offer to buy that vacation cabin and if 
you need a mortgage to finance your purchase, be sure your offer contains a 
mortgage finance contingency clause. 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining a mortgage on vacation or second homes is not always easy. Before you 
make your offer, please consult at least one lender to find out the mortgage 
terms, because the interest rate is usually higher than for urban homes and the 
loan-to-value ratio may be only 50% to 75%. 
</P>
<P>
Paying Extra Principal Trims Life of Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are paying an extra $50 every month, which is applied to the principal of 
our 30-year, $100,000, 8.75% interest-rate home loan. We are into our second 
year of the mortgage and have been told that doing this only really matters in 
the last five years of the loan. But other friends say the extra payments in 
the beginning years shorten the length of the mortgage, plus saving us 
interest. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: Extra principal payments will substantially shorten the life of your 
mortgage, thus saving you significant interest. I calculate your regular 
monthly payment at $786.70 for 30 years. By adding $50 per month to your 
monthly payment, you will cut the mortgage term to about 23 1/2 years, thereby 
saving you about $46,931.48. That's pretty dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
But if you can add an extra $100 per month and pay $886.70 each month, you will 
cut your mortgage to 20 years and save $70,404 in interest. Don't let anyone 
talk you out of making those extra payments each month. 
</P>
<P>
Try Portfolio Lender for More Flexibility 
</P>
<P>
Q: The first-mortgage conventional loan limit is $187,600. When does this limit 
go up, and what will be the new amount? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are referring to the Freddie Mac-Fannie Mae maximum home mortgage. 
Freddie and Fannie are the major home loan buyers in the secondary mortgage 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Their maximum loan limit is set each January, based on average home sale 
prices. However, try to avoid dealing with local originating lenders who only 
sell their mortgages to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae because they are the toughest 
lenders, with rigid loan standards. 
</P>
<P>
Much easier lenders are "portfolio lenders" who keep their loans in their loan 
portfolios rather than selling their loans in the secondary mortgage market. 
Many of the larger S&amp;Ls and banks are portfolio lenders that can be very 
flexible as to maximum loans and borrower qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant Improvements Belong to Landlord 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago, with permission of our landlord, we installed new 
wall-to-wall hallway carpet in our apartment. It cost us about $500. When we 
were preparing to move out at the end of our lease, the building manager 
cautioned us not to remove the hallway carpet. She said if we did, we would 
have to pay for refinishing the hardwood floors. Since we left the carpets, 
shouldn't we be paid the $500 cost by the landlord? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. When a residential tenant makes permanent improvements, in the absence 
of an agreement with the landlord for removal at the end of the rental, if the 
improvements cannot be removed without damaging the property they become the 
landlord's property. The building manager was correct that if you had removed 
the carpets you would have to pay for restoring the floors. Ask your attorney 
for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Profit Tax Requires Planning 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in half of my two-family duplex and rent the other half to tenants. 
My purchase price was about $35,000 and the building is worth at least $175,000 
today. If I sell, can I use that "rollover residence replacement rule" you 
often discuss to avoid profit tax if I buy a $175,000 single-family house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Owners of residential rental real estate who live in one unit and rent the 
balance of the property to tenants can qualify for the "rollover residence 
replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. But this tax-deferral benefit 
only applies to the net (adjusted) sales price of the unit you occupy. 
Incidentally, the "over 55 rule" $125,000 home-sale tax exemption also applies 
to the value of your unit, but not to the rental portion of the property, if 
you are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
If your duplex sells for $175,000 net and the two units are of equal value, 
your residence unit's sale price will be $87,500. If you buy a replacement 
principal residence costing at least $87,500 within 24 months before or after 
the sale, then you can defer tax on the about $70,000 profit from your 
residence unit's sale. However, you will owe tax on the $70,000 profit on the 
sale of the rental unit. 
</P>
<P>
Make a Written Offer; Seller Might Say 'Yes' 
</P>
<P>
Q: The homes in our town seem to be terribly overpriced. I noticed they don't 
seem to be selling as fast as they did a few months ago. But the prices haven't 
come down. How can my husband and I find a home to buy that is fairly priced in 
today's marketplace? 
</P>
<P>
A: When you find a home you want to buy, make a written purchase offer. The 
asking price is only the seller's "dream price." Some correctly priced homes 
sell for their full asking price, but others sell for thousands of dollars 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Until you make a written offer at the price and terms you want, you will never 
know if the seller will accept. Or the seller may counteroffer at a price you 
like. To find the bargains, look for sellers, such as those who are anxious to 
sell due to divorce, job transfer, death or financial problems. Your realty 
agent can usually steer you to the best bargains, but also read the newspaper 
classified ads every day, especially on weekdays when the most anxious sellers' 
homes are advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Accept Appraisal That You Don't Like 
</P>
<P>
Q: Shortly after we contracted to buy our home, we applied for a mortgage with 
the S&amp;L where we have our savings accounts. But the appraisal was about 
$12,500 below our purchase price for the home. The S&amp;L would approve our 
loan if we would raise our down payment by $12,500. When I protested, the loan 
officer tried to intimidate me into accepting the loan. So we went to the bank 
where my company does business and we had no trouble getting the mortgage we 
needed. However, the loan fee was about $1,100 higher. I am thinking of suing 
the S&amp;L for the extra cost. Do you think I should? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Presuming you can handle the matter yourself without an attorney, you 
have everything to gain and nothing to lose. However, your big mistake was not 
protesting that low appraisal. If I am unhappy with an appraisal, I protest 
loud and clear if I can prove the appraiser is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers are unaware that appraisers are often instructed by lenders to 
appraise very conservatively. One of the worst examples occurred when an 
appraiser valued my residence at $50,000 less than I knew it was worth. I 
refused to accept the low appraisal. The loan agent then hired another 
appraisal company which came in with a valuation $50,000 higher and I obtained 
the loan I wanted. As a result, that lender not only earns interest on my first 
mortgage, but on my home equity loan too. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, most lenders want your loan business. If they don't make 
loans, they don't earn profits. Of course, if your property is in a bad part of 
town where the lender unofficially "redlines," then the lender may have 
instructed the appraiser to come in with a very low value, so you will take 
your business elsewhere. Please let me know if you win your $1,100 lawsuit.

BUILDING A DURABLE WOOD PLANTER BOX, STEP BY STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEMI REIS McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redwood or cedar are most often used for planter boxes because they don't 
decompose as quickly as other woods and they are termite resistant. They are 
expensive, but bargains can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Our most expensive planter was our prototype because all of the milling costs 
were one-time-only. When we "mass produced" three planters at once the 
following weekend, we had the lumber yard saw several boards at once, thus 
reducing the overall milling fee. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing we were unprepared for was the difference between finished lumber 
sizes and the traditional name for a board, a crucial point that can throw a 
project off and add to cost if not anticipated. What is called a 1 by 8 
actually measures 3/4 of an inch by 7 3/8 inches, and a 2 by 2 measures 1 1/2 
inches by 1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
To make a planter that measures 29 1/2 inches by 36 inches by 16 inches (a 
large rectangle that will hold 8 cubic feet of soil), lay four 36 inch long 1 
by 8s edge to edge across two sawhorses. Lay two 26 1/2 inch long 2 by 2s inset 
three-fourths of an inch in from the edge of each side but flush with the top 
board (Illustration 1). This can be hand measured with one of the sideboards 
for more accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Use four clamps placed at opposing corners of the assembly to hold the 2 by 2s 
against the 1 by 8s. Very carefully (as the two center boards are not clamped) 
turn assembly over on the sawhorse. Using a half-inch shank variable-speed 
electric drill to tap the screw holes, which should be sunk through the 1 by 8s 
into the 2 by 2s (working from the outside of the structure to the inside). 
Using a screw driver bit greatly speeds the sinking of the screws. Sink two No. 
10 1 1/2 inch galvanized screws per board, evenly spaced. 
</P>
<P>
After the four 1 by 8s are joined forming one long side, place it back on the 
sawhorse with the 2 by 2s facing up. Clamp a 30 inch 2 by 2 centered onto the 
bottom 1 by 8, offset from its bottom edge by three-fourths of an inch 
(Illustration 2). Invert the assembly on the sawhorse and using three evenly 
spaced screws, attach the 1 by 8 to the 30 inch long 2 by 2. Repeat the entire 
process to build the second long side of the planter. 
</P>
<P>
Once those walls are built, the short sides are a bit tricky to attach but we 
did it this way to get a more exact fit, since each saw cut leaves quirky small 
gaps that can be hand fitted to correct. Stand each long side assembly with the 
2 by 2 facing in and fit the top side board to form a U shape, then screw in 
place. Then repeat on opposite top side board to form a complete rectangle 
(Illustration 3). Stand assembly on short side and attach two remaining side 
boards (leaving the bottom, fourth board uninstalled at this point). 
</P>
<P>
Again leaving a three-fourths inch clearance, screw a 14 1/2 inch long 2 by 2 
into each remaining side board (working from the outside to the inside). These 
2 by 2s, along with the 2 by 2s installed into the bottom long board, will form 
the four floor supports. Complete the third wall by screwing the fourth side 
board in. The fourth complete wall is left open for now to accommodate sliding 
the two long floor boards into place (Illustration 4). 
</P>
<P>
Now attach the last side board and screw the floor boards into the underlying 2 
by 2 supports (Illustration 5). Using a 1-inch spade bit, drill six evenly 
spaced drainage holes into the floor boards. The planter can now be 
waterproofed on the inside with a sealant such as Henry's Standard Asphalt 
Emulsion if desired, but some gardeners may prefer to omit this step -- to 
avoid even the remotest possibility of chemicals leaking into the growing 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
Use plastic mesh squares or pottery shards to partially block the drainage 
holes to avoid soil loss. Fill planters with soil, thoroughly soak and allow to 
drain for about two days before planting. JEMI REIS McDONALD

BALCONY GARDEN YIELDS FULL HARVEST OF PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEMI REIS McDONALD, McDonald is a free-lance writer living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I drive through Los Angeles, the tenacity and imagination of the small-space 
gardener amazes me. 
</P>
<P>
From the New Zealand spinach thriving in the semi-shade of a front porch in a 
1-gallon container to the balcony so full of plants there is barely enough room 
for the gardener, their efforts are undaunted by the amount of room available. 
</P>
<P>
When I first walked out onto the 18-by-14-foot second-story balcony of what was 
then my husband's bachelor apartment, it was clearly a small-space gardener's 
dream. Planter hooks hung in the places of maximum light exposure and flower 
pot rings were part of the wrought-iron railings. 
</P>
<P>
I watched the sunlight move over the area for a couple of weeks and although 
slightly discouraged by the mere eight hours of light (just enough), I bought 
my first 2-inch and 5-inch pots of herbs, vegetables and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Lavender, lemon and peppermint-scented geraniums, thyme, rosemary, dill, curled 
parsley, costmary and basil filled small, hanging clay pots, while my 
rectangular redwood planter held a strawberry plant, a Japanese eggplant and a 
tomato plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Our Little Eden 
</P>
<P>
Using 1-gallon plastic containers, my husband and I carried hundreds of gallons 
of water from our upstairs bathroom through three rooms to the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
We delighted in our little Eden, and were soon treated to a harvest of three 
strawberries, one dozen Japanese eggplants and 14 tomatoes. It was a meager 
harvest, but one we were proud of nonetheless. The herbs, however, thrived, and 
I dried lavender to scent our dresser drawers and the costmary for some 
hoped-to-be-discovered use, and we cooked with the fresh parsley, thyme, dill 
and rosemary quite frequently. 
</P>
<P>
I soon became a victim of my flourishing herbs: they got bigger and bigger and 
required a succession of transplantings into larger and larger containers. I 
reluctantly gave up my beloved clay pots in favor of plastic to reduce weight 
and conserve water. My original 2-inch thyme and rosemary plants are now 
overflowing their 5-gallon containers and measure about 1 foot by 2 feet each. 
</P>
<P>
The second season, I grew more audacious. I planted eight "baby" corn plants 
and discovered, three months later, that although the harvest was miniature, 
the mother plant was within normal corn size -- about 5 to 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cramped Roots 
</P>
<P>
My interest in gardening grew, The Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening and 
Taylor's Guide to Vegetables and Herbs became my horticultural Bibles, yet the 
garden remained imprisoned in inadequate pots and containers with low yields 
because of cramped root systems. 
</P>
<P>
When I would pull out the annual plants at season's end, the entire soil 
content was one solid churning root system in search of nourishment, sometimes 
growing out of the drainage holes. 
</P>
<P>
The garden was pretty, quaint and a joy to tend, but I wanted it to perform, 
wanted vegetable crops I would really see making a difference in our cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Finally one day I put two facts together and began to create a solution to my 
space problems. I had learned the average root depth for vegetables was 2 feet, 
whereas my deepest planter box was 8 inches and my tallest clay pot was 12 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
I realized that if my plants were higher up, in very deep planters, I could 
take advantage of greater sunlight access while providing adequate room for 
greater root spread, increasing my yield. Yet I had little horizontal space, so 
this planter would have to be much taller than wide, something I had not seen 
in any nursery and which would have been exorbitantly expensive, judging from 
the smaller sizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Redwood Planters 
</P>
<P>
Also, the wooden planters I had seen were held together with nails and 
stainless steel ribbons that would pull apart after several season's weight and 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
I had seen something similar to what I needed in a gardening magazine but it 
had handles for carrying and wheels for moving around, was square and required 
nails for its construction. I didn't need mobility, so I figured I would take 
the basic design and enlarge it, strengthen it and make it a rectangle. 
</P>
<P>
Thus one Saturday my husband and I sat over brunch with paper and pencil 
between us. Several muted arguments later, and after drawings, calculations and 
refinements, we ended with a design that is adaptable to any space, is sturdy 
and beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
The redwood we used gives off an intriguing spicy smell when watered as well as 
lending a woodsy feeling to the cityscape it adorns. 
</P>
<P>
Having finished the planters (four in all) by early March (two weekends of 
work), I began the task of choosing vegetables and herbs that would yield the 
most per square inch of space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes Are Healthy 
</P>
<P>
I set seeds into 2-inch pots so I could bring them indoors in case of a freak 
frost (at least three of which have happened in the last three years) and 
transplanted them into the planters in early April. A hose attached to the 
bathtub tap helps with the now-gargantuan task of watering. 
</P>
<P>
As with any garden, especially with the complications of limited light and the 
dangers of over-watering with container gardening, I have had some successes 
and some failures. 
</P>
<P>
My Roma tomatoes are healthy, bountiful and just ripening now and the Japanese 
eggplants are another high-yield crop. I have seen at least a 50% or more 
increase in plant size and crop yield working with the planters. Arugula and 
chiso (a Japanese herb) are shorter-term crops that grow well in the lower 
light areas of the balcony and several summer lettuces are surviving the heat 
so far (Little Gem, Little Red Riding Hood and Red Leprechaun). 
</P>
<P>
The Italian parsley, coriander, red, green, orange and yellow sweet peppers, 
baby watermelon, honeyloupe and basil plants are all thriving to date, though 
the jury is still out on the melons, which are just setting fruit now. 
</P>
<P>
All in all I have reached my sought-after goal: almost every night there is an 
element of our dinner that has been home grown in our own organic garden on the 
balcony off our bedroom.

MOVE UP IN THE WORLD BY REMODELING THE ATTIC; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN ADDITIONAL LIVING SPACE IS CREATED UPSTAIRS, INSULATION IS THE MAIN 
CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who need more living space in their homes but don't want to expand the 
outside dimensions of the house are inclined to look up -- toward the attic. 
The most important factor to consider in the finishing of the attic is the 
amount and placement of the insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Most unfinished attics have some insulation in the attic floor. That insulation 
was originally thought to be needed to prevent the movement of rising heat 
through the ceiling of the living area and attic floor into the attic itself. 
Otherwise energy and money would be wasted in heating an attic in which no one 
ever spent time. 
</P>
<P>
It now has been determined not only that the amount of insulation in the attic 
floor is insufficient to take care of the requirements of an area where people 
live but also that the large savings made possible by proper insulation applies 
just as much to a house with air conditioning as it does to a house with heat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check the insulation 
</P>
<P>
A check of the insulation in the attic floor usually will reveal about 3 inches 
of insulation. The National Bureau of Standards and other agencies concerned 
with energy have estimated that 6 inches of insulation would fill the bill in 
the attic floor in regions of relatively mild winters. Amounts greater than 
that are justifiable where the climate is colder or warmer than average. Other 
reasons for increasing the insulation would be where energy costs are expected 
to rise and where walls are poorly insulated. 
</P>
<P>
When adding insulation to the floor, use batts or blankets without vapor 
barriers. If the new installation has such barriers, remove or slash them with 
a knife. When it is inconvenient to use batts or blankets, loose insulation can 
be used. If, by some chance, the attic floor had no insulation and you are 
utilizing batts or blankets with vapor barriers, make sure those barriers are 
facing downward. 
</P>
<P>
Insulation to be placed in the walls of the new living quarters should be set 
into place after the framework is up but before the full walls are up. Staples 
used on the flanges of the insulation should be spaced about 8 inches apart. 
You may want to look into what are called wire insulation supports. 
</P>
<P>
Because the object of a vapor barrier is to keep moisture out of the insulation 
itself, a cut or tear in the barrier must be repaired instantly. This can be 
done with a piece of barrier from a scrap section of the insulation or, in the 
absence of that, a piece of polyethylene. Any opening in the barrier will 
permit moisture to get through and thus destroy the entire purpose of the 
covering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prevent leakage 
</P>
<P>
No matter how efficiently your attic is insulated, there will be a considerable 
amount of leakage. Air, besides escaping around window frames, can get through 
electrical connections, plumbing stacks, ducts and whatever connections have 
been made to make living upstairs comfortable. A rule of thumb: Wherever you 
see any gap that might permit air or heat to escape, plug it up somehow, with 
weatherstripping, caulking compound or anything at all that will do the job. 
One way to handle this, especially around window frames, is with the wool from 
an insulation blanket. Pull it from a blanket and stuff it by hand into the 
opening. Since insulation fiber can cause skin irritation, wear work gloves. 
It's also a good idea to wear clothing that covers all the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, there must be plenty of ventilation at the top part of the 
attic. There usually are a couple of vents at the gable ends, but a combination 
of vents there and at the eaves is much better. Moisture vapor must be 
permitted to get out of the attic, either through the vents or with assistance 
from one or more fans. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed instructions on insulating an attic are included in Andy Lang's 
booklet "Save Money by Insulating." Send $1 and a stamped, long envelope to 
Know-How, P.O. Box 477, Huntington, NY 11743.

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T GET TIED UP ON REMOVING SASH CORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone haywire. I am 
fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can the cord be removed or is 
it too much of a job? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings 
on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially 
if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash 
cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is 
connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Before you do this, however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the 
market. They are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Can Plywood Be Nailed Directly to Studs? 
</P>
<P>
Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by 
nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is 
much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the 
studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail 
to the studs? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs 
warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven. The furring 
strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method, 
you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it. In any case, no matter 
which method of installation you use, buy the plywood ahead of time so it can 
be kept in the room several days before application. This will give it time to 
acclimate. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered Pumice: Where to Buy It 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently told someone about using powdered pumice to smooth the surface 
of a piece of furniture that had just been finished. I was unable to get it in 
my local hardware store, which referred me to the local pharmacy. Sure enough, 
the drug store carried it. Thought your readers would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. While most hardware stores and home center dealers carry the 
powdered pumice, so do some drug stores and some art supply establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Sawing Metal Takes Different Strokes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have cut a lot of wood, but I have never used a hacksaw. This time I have 
to cut some metal. Is there any trick to it or do I just saw the same way as 
with a crosscut saw? 
</P>
<P>
A: Forget about the way you cut wood. With a hacksaw, you do not apply pressure 
on the backstroke. The hacksaw must be held as flat as possible for an even 
cut. Put the pressure on the forward stroke, release the pressure on the back 
stroke. When possible, keep both hands on the hacksaw frame. Start the cut with 
several short foward strokes. When putting the blade in the frame, the teeth 
should slant forward. 
</P>
<P>
Should Molding on Plywood Be Glued? 
</P>
<P>
Q: To cover the edges of plywood, I plan on attaching molding to them. Should I 
use glue or nails or what? 
</P>
<P>
A: Use glue and then a couple of well-placed nails. Depending on the kind of 
project you are working on, the finishing nails can be driven a bit below the 
surface and the indentations filled with wood putty or other filler. 
</P>
<P>
Patches Available for Hiding Holes in Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can handle most of the 
job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling the few spots where there are 
openings in the wall without anything behind them. Can I apply masking tape 
over each opening and then cover with a patching compound? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill is a ready-made 
patch available in most paint stores and home centers. Tape it on according to 
the directions and you will find it easy to disguise the patch when it is 
painted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach, 
remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the 
Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477,

L.A. OFFICE VACANCIES LOWEST IN 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vacancy rate in downtown Los Angeles offices is at its lowest level in two 
years and is expected to remain low, despite the fact that the market is about 
to be flooded with an unprecedented amount of new space, according to a report 
by Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
It attributed the low vacancy rates to a dramatic surge in pre-leasing activity 
during the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The absorption level, or net total of square footage occupied during the 
quarter ending June 30, soared to 350,031 square feet, according to the report, 
which notes that only 21,960 square feet was absorbed during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the space leased during the second quarter is in buildings still under 
construction. "Downtown office buildings are like cars," said Raymond M. 
Lepone, a senior marketing consultant with Grubb &amp; Ellis. "Everyone wants 
to drive the newest and fanciest car in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 High-Rises 
</P>
<P>
Seven high-rises, including the largest ever built in the city, are nearing 
completion in the Central Business District. Together, the new high-rises will 
add about 6.5 million square feet to the existing base downtown of 25.5 million 
square feet, the report states, and another 16.5 million square feet in 11 
projects have been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"When the first set of (seven) buildings is finished during the next two years, 
the downtown region will have completed one of the largest single cycles of 
development in its history," said Lepone, "but during the next 10 years, even 
this boom will be tripled." 
</P>
<P>
Office vacancies for the first six months in the downtown area stood at 12.6%, 
which is one of the lowest vacancy rates in the nation, the report indicates. 
At the end of last year, the downtown rate was 14.2%, but one year ago, it was 
12.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Major Projects 
</P>
<P>
The study shows that pre-leasing activity has been concentrated in three 
projects: First Interstate Tower at Library Square, which is 70% pre-leased; 
the Wilshire at Figueroa Building, 60% pre-leased, and Grand Place, 50% 
pre-leased. 
</P>
<P>
"Average, healthy pre-leasing would be about 20% to 25%," said Lepone, "so this 
cycle . . . has been phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
The Mid-Wilshire region is also doing well, according to the report, which 
shows vacancies there plummeting at the end of the first half of the year to 
12.2%. That compares with a rate of 17.9% recorded one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Major Signings 
</P>
<P>
The drop is described as "the first major reduction in vacancies since 1985" 
and is attributed to three major lease signings, including two by the State of 
California. No new construction was reported in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Other geographical areas mentioned in the report are downtown Pasadena, which 
posted a vacancy rate of 15.5%, up from the 9.8% recorded a year ago; Glendale, 
which had a vacancy rate of 14.2%, a decline from the 21.1% posted for the same 
period last year, and the San Gabriel Valley, which finished the first half of 
this year with a vacancy rate of 26.4%, the highest of all Los Angeles markets. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes, however, that the expansion rate there is nearly double that 
of Southern California, and absorption levels there are also the highest of any 
market surveyed.

HOTEL GETS A $65-MILLION FACE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lobby lounge and cafe at the Regent Beverly Wilshire have been redesigned, 
marking the completion of the $65-million first-phase renovation of the 
landmark hotel at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm of Gruen Associates, the 
renovation restores "the original architectural character of the hotel, which 
has been obscured and modified over the years," according to Kurt Franzen of 
Gruen. 
</P>
<P>
The major design program is aimed at reclaiming the hotel's place as one of the 
"finest in the nation," according to Robert H. Burns, president of Regent 
International Hotels, the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Glenn Texeira, principal of Project Associates, said his 
firm's goal was "to create a truly grand hotel in the finest European 
tradition." The lobby is designed in tones of gold, beige and brown marble, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also part of the first phase renovation of the 61-year-old building was the 
renovation of the Wilshire Wing of the hotel with larger rooms, reducing the 
number from 220 to 147. Special acoustical windows have been installed that can 
be opened, yet almost completely eliminate traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the renovation, scheduled for completion by next spring, 
encompasses the 235-room Beverly Wing. The wing, constructed in 1971, is 
undergoing a "floor-by-floor refurbishment," according to Franzen.

OUTTAKES: CORNY BUT TRUE

<P>
Universal Studios, eat your heart out. Dyersville, Iowa -- site of the 
cornfield that "starred" as the magical baseball diamond in "Field of Dreams" 
-- has become a hot tourist attraction too. 
</P>
<P>
"We direct hundreds of people to the field each week," said Mary Lee Harmon, 
manager of the Visitors Bureau in nearby Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
For the film's purposes the baseball diamond was built on land owned by two 
farmers. The farmer who owns the land that comprised left and center fields has 
since replanted it with corn. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Lansing, owner of infield and right field, has kept his portion 
unfarmed -- and is personally maintaining it. He's mowing, watering and 
smoothing down the red dirt base paths. And he's put out signs directing people 
to "the movie set." Adjacent to the field is Lansing's lemonade concession -- 
and a T-shirt stand.

STAGE WEEK: ELIZABETH HAILEY: LIFE WITH A PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>

"People are probably more embarrassed for us than we are for ourselves -- 
because we know what really happened," said Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey of her 
two-character comedy-drama, "Joanna's Husband and David's Wife" (opening 
tonight at the Pasadena Playhouse), a semi-autobiographical account of her 
29-year marriage to playwright Oliver Hailey. "The truth is, I've taken great 
liberties." 
</P>
<P>
She describes her story as "the drama that begins after 'happily ever after.' " 
The play opens with David, 25 years married, waking up to find that his wife 
has taken off; the only explanation left is a journal she's kept since the day 
they met. As he reads aloud from it, "The play unfolds inside his head," Hailey 
noted. "So at first it's an older David looking back on Joanna when she was 
young, remembering how enthusiastic and naive she was -- before life battered 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"At one stage, Joanna is content to be 'David's wife.' Then he has to learn how 
to be 'Joanna's husband,' when she writes a book that's successful." Hailey 
faced a bit of that herself a few years ago when her first novel, "A Woman of 
Independent Means," became a hit -- as a book, then a play. Real-life also 
takes a twist with the casting of Kendall Hailey (the author's daughter) as 
Joanna. "Seeing her is very Fellini-esque," Hailey admits, "because it's real 
enough to make people wonder." 
</P>
<P>
That reality wasn't always easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, you wonder if anybody's interested (in your story)," she said. "But 
this is my third novel, and I'm getting brave enough to get close to the 
material of my own life -- and also have the courage to embroider facts, not be 
afraid to invent and heighten the drama. In 'A Woman of Independent Means,' I 
found that by using specific incidents from my own life, I could relate to a 
lot of people. It's the same with this marriage. I'd say the tone is 
bittersweet, finally affirmative -- but a bit ambivalent. It's a hard-earned 
happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cort directs.

THEATER FILE: David Schweizer, who directed Marlane Meyer's controversial 
"Kingfish" last fall at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, will re-team with the

<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Vaclav Havel's modern takeoff on the Faust legend, 
"Temptation," is playing at the Mark Taper Forum, with Mark Harelik as the 
young Czech scientist intrigued with the occult. Richard Jordan directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "Havel overcame the detachment of the early 
didactic scenes to end his play with a deliberate flamboyant flourish of 
jeering and spent emotion. He got it right. The Taper gets it partly right." 
</P>
<P>
From Steve Mikulan in the L.A. Weekly: "Havel's Faustian fable would no doubt 
strike many a sensitive chord back home, but in America it leaves us a bit 
cold. The main problem is the deliberate vagueness of the script." 
</P>
<P>
Noted the Orange County Register's Jeff Rubio: "Fine director Jordan and a 
splendid cast work very hard to milk the play for its theatrical potential, 
(which) yields some hearty laughs and moments of insight about state duplicity 
and suspicion of non-conformists. But they are disconnected moments." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charles Marowitz in the Herald Examiner: "Jordan's production captures all 
the levity of Havel's work but almost none of its gravity. It's as if the 
director felt a pill so remorselessly dialectical had to be generously sugared 
and sprinkled with jimmies if it were going to be swallowed at all." 
</P>
<P>
And from the Daily News' Tom Jacobs: "Havel is an accomplished playwright. His 
technique of having one scene echo another -- key lines and situations get 
repeated in slightly different form -- give the play an eerie, neo-absurdist 
edge. His characters don't have much depth but a number are amusing."

MATCHMAKERS MAY BE LAST HOPE FOR VANISHING SPECIES 
</P>

<P>
Wanted: Big, beautiful beast, one of last of dying breed, as possible mate for 
same. Serious inquiries only. 
</P>
<P>
That is the pitch a group of zoologists is making to zookeepers around the 
country. Their matchmaking service, a sort of modern-day Noah's Ark, could be 
the last hope for many wild animals facing extinction. 
</P>
<P>
This ark is fashioned from computer software and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Through it, a black rhino calf was born in Detroit to a mother swapped from 
Oklahoma City whose seven previous offspring had lived less than a month. 
"Logistically, it was difficult and expensive," said Doris Applebaum, registrar 
at the Detroit Zoological Park. She said the switch cost around $6,000, but "it 
was well worth it." The calf, born in March, is doing well, Applebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
The black rhino is declining at a rate of 97% per generation, said Nathan 
Flesness, director of International Species Information System, which compiles 
data for the animal swapping program. The animal's population has plummeted 
from 70,000 in 1970 to about 3,000 today, and captivity may be the key to its 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Humans shoot them to sell their horns for enough to retire on for the rest of 
their life," Flesness said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, with headquarters here in the Minnesota Zoo, is called the Species 
Survival Plan. It was set up by the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and 
Aquariums in 1980 with a goal not only of matching animals, but also of 
persuading zookeepers that donating or swapping some of their most prized 
possessions is in the long-term interest of their profession. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty species -- including the gorilla, cheetah and thick-billed parrot -- so 
far have climbed aboard the computer ark. Thomas Foose, the program's 
coordinator, said he hopes that number will increase tenfold by the start of 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of species to include usually comes down to "the big and the 
beautiful," Flesness said. "It's a long way short of everything, but it's a lot 
better than doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Foose's group tracks data, including genealogy and medical history, compiled by 
the ISIS on more than 96,000 living vertebrate specimens in 347 zoos and 32 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Foose said that as a result of the gorilla program, for example, there is less 
inbreeding, so healthier babies are being born. About 15 gorillas have been 
born each year for the last 10 years with the population currently about 300. 
"We've gone from a situation where that population was declining to one where 
it's increasing by about 2% or 3% a year," he said. "That's very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Gorilla mating is difficult since long-established pairs tend to treat each 
other like brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, Flesness said, is just a plane ride away: "Put one of the two 
partners on an airplane, switch them to another zoo, and let them make 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
While conservationists once had misgivings about keeping exotic animals in 
captivity, they are realizing the role zoos can play in preservation, Flesness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife managers, he said, increasingly realize that they have a small 
population and that it is often in one place. "They want to take their species 
into captivity for insurance reasons, and they suddenly move into the same 
arena, the same set of challenges as zoos." 
</P>
<P>
The Puerto Rican parrot is an example. Forty-three of the birds exist in the 
wild on the island, and an equal number live in captivity there. 
</P>
<P>
"If one bad hurricane comes, they'll not only wipe out the wild birds but at 
least endanger the ones in the aviary," Flesness said. Conservationists, he 
said, have agreed that a few of the animals should be moved to a mainland zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of easing animals back into the wild look bleak, he said, as long 
as humans keep encroaching on their natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"The species that are going to make it out there are the ones that can handle 
lots of bulldozers, highway disturbance, and little teeny spots of semi-wild 
land left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big ones are the ones that are . . . going to go unless we do something 
radically different. What's surprising is that they're going to go in our 
lifetime."

RADIO HOST TUNES IN ON STARS FOR ADVICE ON EARTHLINGS' WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extraterrestrials are giving advice to the lovelorn, ecology tips and 
suggestions for world peace via a tiny radio show in upscale Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Aliens are said to be tuning in and giving earthly advice when 
weekly radio talk show host Carol Austen hits the airwaves with her "Ask the 
Source" program. 
</P>
<P>
Austen, 61, claims that through channeling, a process in which her brain acts 
as a "crystal" receiver for cosmic messages, she can hear from aliens who dwell 
among the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Her long-distance callers include galactic Commanders Ashtar and Ashtara from 
the star group Sirius, who through Austen sometimes give advice on love and 
family matters. 
</P>
<P>
If the galactic couple is otherwise occupied, there are always the friendly 
Pleiadeans from the Pleiades constellation and the vocal Cosmos family -- 
Cosmos IV through XIX -- who say they are 150,000 years ahead of Earthlings, 
traveling aboard their M-100 space station. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours every Saturday morning, Austen relays the thoughts of various 
extraterrestrials in her broadcast from the trendy Thunderbird Bookstore. About 
30 followers gather to drink coffee and nibble on freshly baked muffins while 
they participate in the program and get first-hand advice from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
Austen's radio show reaches about 7,000 of the curious and faithful tuned to 
10,000-watt KNZS-AM, 1540 on the dial, throughout an area stretching 60 miles 
north to the southern San Jose area and 90 miles south to the San Luis Obispo 
area, says station manager Peter Widdershoven. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has reservations about the validity of the callers from outer 
space, Widdershoven said, "There is a substantial market for this. A lot of 
people are seeking answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I put her on originally as a New Age type of deal, but when I saw those phone 
lines light up with dozens and dozens of callers -- I have to respect this as a 
broadcaster," Widdershoven said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an audience for this." 
</P>
<P>
If E.T. called home, then there's no reason why extraterrestrials can't call 
back. In fact, they do if only we'll listen, says Austen, whose company, 
StarLink Communications, purchases a two-hour block of time from the radio 
station for $400, then sells commercials to cover the costs. The program is 
rebroadcast on Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Correspondents' Report 
</P>
<P>
On a typical Saturday, Austen warms up with reports from "correspondents" like 
Sasha, a middle-aged woman who tells the audience she is worried about 
endangered wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"Some animals are safer on a New York subway than in Yellowstone Park," she 
reports. What can be done, Sasha asks. 
</P>
<P>
Austen tells her audience to relax, place their feet squarely on the floor and 
concentrate with her. She will ask her extraterrestrial friends. 
</P>
<P>
There is a brief silence and then she begins to speak, at first representing 
Ashtar, who commends a recent issue of Life magazine, which did a cover story 
on UFOs. The picture on the cover of a flying saucer is "one of ours" Ashtar 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He advises everyone to buy and carry video cameras so that they can document 
UFO appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting some static," Austen tells the audience, then explains that Ashtar 
has faded and Cosmos IV is now calling from the M-100 star station. Cosmos IV 
feels that, "I should come to be with you and do an entire show." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wildlife in the Subway 
</P>
<P>
Earth's wildlife is endangered everywhere, not just in a subway, Cosmos IV 
says, adding: "You'd be surprised how much wildlife is in a subway." 
</P>
<P>
Cosmos IV recommends an ecological relationship between land and its use. He 
predicts a heightened awareness of the ecology by the heads of large 
corporations and the universities of the world. 
</P>
<P>
And so the program goes. Austen and her alien friends comment on the Alaska oil 
spill (they've given the formula for an emulsion to clean up the oil), give 
advice on rearing children and help 18-year-old Shannon know whether the girl 
he likes truly loves him. 
</P>
<P>
"Get to know each other. Speak through the heart," Cosmos IV advises the 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Austen says she began hearing from aliens four years ago, shortly after reading 
the book "The Psychology of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral 
Mind" by Julian Jaynes. She was studying phenomena in which people were 
communicating with sources outside themselves when the Pleiadeans, using her 
brain as a receiver, tuned in, Austen said. 
</P>
<P>
"One night when we were working as a group I felt a different energy come in 
and I heard an inner voice say, 'Welcome, these are your star friends from the 
Pleiades and we want to talk to you tonight.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delphic Oracles 
</P>
<P>
" 'There are seven stars in the Pleiades. They all have names; they are called 
the Rezen Sisters, the same as the seven ancient Delphic oracles.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'They exist in many histories. Most American Indian tribes think of 
themselves as star children. They all say their ancestors came from the 
Pleiades. So do African natives, the Dagons of Mali, the Egyptians, the 
Sumerians all say they are star children.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her channeling has opened a vast storehouse of information, Austen said. For 
their part, the aliens have charged her with the three-pronged responsibility 
of bringing peace to the planet, cleaning up the Earth and defending the 
innocent.

WITCHES WIN NONPROFIT TAX STATUS AS A RELIGION, HOPE TO SHED EVIL IMAGE

<P>
Witches in Rhode Island -- which was founded as a haven for religious 
dissenters -- hope that they, too, will gain public acceptance now that the 
state has recognized their sect as a legitimate religious group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Rosegate Coven want outsiders to see them as followers of a 
faith, not freaks who ride brooms and cast spells. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in a kitchen adorned with skulls, pictures of sorcerers, 
the obligatory broom and a humorous kitchen-witch, the members talked about 
their attempts to sensitize others to their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to combat centuries of conditioning. People have been conditioned by 
their religion . . . and society to ridicule us, not to take anything seriously 
that the Christian religion doesn't put forth," said the coven's high 
priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't easily give up their misconceptions -- they really enjoy them," 
said Siegrist, 46, who is also director of the New England chapter of the 
Witches' Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last October, the group, which has about 40 members, decided to 
incorporate as a nonprofit religious group and apply for exemption from the 
Rhode Island sales tax. Recently, the state tax administrator reversed an 
earlier decision and approved the request. 
</P>
<P>
The framed exemption certificate hangs in the modest kitchen near an enlarged 
photograph showing the Rosegate "grove," the overall group of about 40 
initiates. The coven, or inner core of leaders, consists of about a dozen 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the intent wasn't to save the 6% sales tax," said Julian Bradford, 
who handles Rosegate's public relations. "It was to obtain the legitimization." 
</P>
<P>
The coven, also known as Our Lady of the Roses Wiccan Church, decided to come 
out of the closet in part because of recent publicity about Satanists. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lumped with them for 800 years. It makes us stand up and say 
'enough is enough!' " Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
To believe in Satan, one first must believe in the Judeo-Christian tradition, 
Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wiccans believe in a deity with both male and female attributes, whose 
psychic energy can be tapped by anyone. Rosegate, a Wiccan sect, emphasizes 
metaphysics rather than simple magic, and does not use many of the props often 
associated with witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"In our tradition we are trying to eradicate needless superstition," said 
Siegrist. She cited as an example the use of crystal balls. "The ball doesn't 
have diddly. The power comes from within." 
</P>
<P>
From Siegrist's kitchen office, equipped with a copying machine, the coven puts 
out a newsletter eight times a year, keeps track of its 75-subscriber mailing 
list, arranges witchcraft classes and plans meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The group has a small building fund and hopes someday to open a center, 
complete with sanctuary and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rosegate suffers little harassment overall, said Siegrist. A crank caller who 
repeatedly phoned during the interview was "really the first crank I've ever 
had to put up with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But "the mockery is always going to exist," said Bradford. "We're the victims 
of eight or nine centuries of bad press." 
</P>
<P>
When hostility surfaces, "we try our best not to return it," Siegrist said. 
</P>
<P>
The witches profess to be uninhibited about their beliefs but appear to be held 
back by their traditional upbringings. 
</P>
<P>
Sanura, 49, the secretary and musician of the group, said she has told only one 
relative that she is a witch. "Those Irish Catholics would disown me for sure." 
She would not give her Christian name. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford, who fought in Vietnam and has a "Mother" tattoo on his forearm, said: 
"We're very open about what we are because we have nothing to hide. We welcome 
the opportunity to educate others." 
</P>
<P>
He said others are accepting when they learn he is a witch. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy made broom jokes at work until he had a problem I worked out with a 
little magic," he said. Bradford, who works at an East Providence car 
dealership, would not elaborate on the problem or his solution, other than to 
say there was "no hocus-pocus, simply the application of proven metaphysical 
principles." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the coven has proved that it is legitimate, at least in the eyes of 
Rhode Island's division of taxation, what does it want now? 
</P>
<P>
"Give us a corporate broom to fly us to the Bahamas," Bradford said.

CANADIAN BORDER HAS TRAFFIC JAMS WHEN CHEAPER U.S. BARS CLOSE;

<P>
Foreign trade could not be much freer than in the Twin Saults, the two cities 
with the same name separated by the 2 1/2-mile breadth of the St. Marys River 
and flying different flags. 
</P>
<P>
Americans and Canadians go back and forth across the border in droves to buy 
bread, have babies or drink beer, without a worry about tariffs or quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it jumping across the big ditch," Canadian steel worker Richard 
Shurtliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1 Beer Draws Canadians 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesdays after work, Shurtliffe and his buddies cross the river from Sault 
Ste. Marie, Ontario, to the $1-a-beer bars in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. Canadian 
brew tastes better, but American suds are cheaper, Shurtliffe says. 
</P>
<P>
Beer isn't the only bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's dairy prices, for instance, are jacked up by a farm support system 
that is unlikely to change even under the country's free-trade agreements with 
the United States. No matter, Shurtliffe says. He buys American. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he buy U.S. milk for his grandchildren, he fills his pickup truck 
with U.S. gasoline and his refrigerator with U.S. steaks. 
</P>
<P>
Even Canadian cigarettes are cheaper in U.S. stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheaper in Michigan 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awful savings," Shurtliffe said. "It seems everything's cheaper in 
Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
It is commerce without national loyalty. In the Sault (pronounce it soo), many 
American women have their American babies in Canada and tourists buy their 
Canadian souvenirs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest traffic jams at Canada customs are at 2:30 a.m., when the U.S. bars 
close and Canadians go home. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agent Giacomo Pastore has seen the happy drivers line up for as long as 
45-minute waits at the border crossing into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ritual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awful pile of Canadians," Shurtliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Towns Not Identical 
</P>
<P>
Locals call them the Twin Saults or the Two Saults, but these cities on 
opposite sides of the Soo shipping locks are anything but identical. 
</P>
<P>
Historical markers on the U.S. side tell of the treaty taking northern Michigan 
from the Chippewa Indians. A plaque on Canadian soil remembers the shameful 
"Chicoro Incident" of 1870, when the United States refused to let a Canadian 
military ship pass through the U.S. locks. The Canadians had to walk around the 
St. Marys rapids. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario's Sault is six times the size of Michigan's. The Ontario town of 83,000 
has a steel mill, paper mill and a large shopping mall. Its downtown Queen 
Street is dotted with upscale china shops. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it has more movie theaters, a lower drinking age and two strip clubs, 
Michigan teen-ager Dean Newcomb noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourism a Big Industry 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Sault is a quiet home to 14,500 people, many of whom don't lock 
their doors. Summer tourism is the major industry. Winter snow is the biggest 
occurence. Along a three-block drive of kitsch shops, visitors can buy blue 
wind chimes from Taiwan and T-shirts that say Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Canada? 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to buy a Canadian souvenir in their Sault," Bob Smith, owner of a 
block of such tourist emporiums as Ships Ahoy, Captains Quarters and the Anchor 
and Seven Seas motels, explained. "This is where the tourists shop." 
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the free-trade pact between the two countries, the easy 
commerce between the Saults has become even freer and easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to have opened up the gate," said Patrick Shannon, the Chippewa 
County prosecutor on the Michigan side. "Trade hasn't changed, but all of a 
sudden the Canadians have realized they can go shopping on our side. Crossing 
the border isn't such an issue any more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Enforcement Problem 
</P>
<P>
That's a problem. Law enforcement in Sault, Mich., used to be a personal 
matter. You knew who was having a family fight and who was driving home from 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people crossing over these days, the town is full of strangers. 
"We don't know who we're dealing with anymore," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the foreign trade is faring well. 
</P>
<P>
American insurance companies have put a crimp in the once-booming business of 
delivering babies in Ontario. Ten years ago, as many as 20% of the women 
patients of an Ontario obstetrician, Dr. T. Orr, were Americans drawn by the 
more-specialized services available in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with U.S. Medicare and many insurance companies refusing to pay for health 
care outside the United States, foreigners make up only 8% of Orr's practice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Border Math' 
</P>
<P>
Because the banks and bars, tourist centers and tollgates all set their own 
exchange rates, commerce between the Saults can get complicated. Those who 
cross frequently must master "border math." 
</P>
<P>
Shurtliffe's wife, Ruth, for example, can figure which is cheaper: gasoline at 
54 cents Canadian per liter or $1.21 American per gallon. That is considering 
also that her Canadian dollar currently buys only 80 cents American and she has 
to pay $1.50 to drive across the International Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
It can get so confusing that many businesses accept the other country's 
currency, even if it isn't legal tender. A Canadian dollar will buy as much 
beer at David Dear's Back Door bar as a U.S. greenback. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, we are the Twin Saults," Dear said. More than half of his customers 
are Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double Financial Whammy 
</P>
<P>
With the American dollar worth more at the moment, U.S. residents who forget to 
exchange their money for Canadian suffer a double whammy. Not only do most 
Canadian businesses take U.S. currency at the lower Canadian value, but 
Canadian prices often are higher. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an advantage of having the right money on the right side at the right 
time," said Linda Sumner, a Michigan tourist from Livonia. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Putman, a farmer from Williamston, Mich., got caught in a Canadian 
restaurant with hungry kids and only U.S. cash in his wallet. He paid American 
and bought his food for 15% more than true cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the waitress gave me my change in Canadian, so I was out there, 
too," Putman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got even. I tipped her in Canadian."

TEEN-AGER'S DEATH OUTRAGES BLACKS IN TOLEDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
TOLEDO, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a Monday morning when most people were returning to work, the Rev. Floyd 
Rose and his supporters gathered at the Ottawa River to remember a 16-year-old 
black teen-ager who drowned in the muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not have to die," Rose, pastor of the Family Baptist Church, said after 
Robert Thomas' mother, Diane, placed a wreath in the water where her son died. 
His death has sparked a new wave of civil rights demonstrations in this 
northwestern Ohio city. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who was described as afraid of water, drowned July 26 after he jumped 
into the river while being chased by a white University of Toledo police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizens Outraged 
</P>
<P>
The prayer vigil Aug. 7 attracted 100 people who were outraged because there 
was about an hour's delay before fire division water rescue workers were 
contacted to begin a search for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, the most visible of Toledo's civil rights leaders, promises to keep the 
pressure on city officials until questions surrounding the boy's death are 
answered. Police and fire officials say proper procedures were followed, but 
refuse to comment further while the investigation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
"The city always takes the African-American community for fools," Rose said. 
"Had they told us that there was a breakdown in communication by the police and 
fire departments and apologized for the error, we would have understood. 
</P>
<P>
"But the city never apologized to anyone. Instead, they said everyone followed 
proper procedures and tried to say Robert was a criminal, even though he wasn't 
charged with anything. Instead of being conciliatory, they have been arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
"We've backed down before, but not this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuse to Meet 
</P>
<P>
About 17% of the city's 340,000 residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders, led by Mayor Donna Owens, have tried to meet with Rose and 
several other key activists to defuse the unrest, but those efforts have been 
rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the city wants something from us they call a meeting," Rose said. 
"But when we try to discuss problems facing the city -- our concerns -- they 
claim we're being unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Owens said the point of meeting is to move beyond rhetoric and start dealing 
with issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time that Rose and everyone else starts considering the safety 
and concerns of all of our citizens in this community and that we work together 
in building positive relationships," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiring Practices 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1970s, an advocacy group has been monitoring the hiring 
practices of the city's police and fire departments, which are under federal 
court order to hire more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Racial tensions flared in June, 1988, after City Manager Philip Hawkey, who is 
white, dismissed one black official and suspended two other blacks he accused 
of mismanaging the city's housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
After public hearings late last year, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission and the 
city signed an agreement July 28 that Toledo will hire and promote more 
minorities and women. A report on Toledo's race relations is pending from the 
Ohio Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, also as a result 
of those hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In March, controversy over sexist and racist remarks allegedly made by Fire 
Chief William Winkle brought many white leaders into the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Winkle was suspended for 20 days for making a sexist remark about a female city 
employee. Later, the city released a 1982 report that said firefighters heard 
Winkle praise Adolf Hitler and support lynching blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Winkle rarely talks publicly about the allegations, which he has denied. He did 
not return a telephone message seeking additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Intangible Prejudice' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the prejudice is intangible," Rose said. "The kind of prejudice in 
Toledo isn't like the segregation in the South. Many people in the white 
community couldn't put their fingers on why we felt the way we did. Then they 
saw Winkle, his attitude and the city's unwillingness to take any action. Now 
they know." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' drowning opened new wounds. Authorities say he jumped into the river to 
elude officers pursuing him and three others suspected of trying to steal 
several cases of soda from a convenience store near the University of Toledo. 
The other suspects were not apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said if Thomas had been white, rescuers would have been sent much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is investigating whether Thomas' civil rights were violated before he 
jumped in the rain-swollen river. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkey said a report on the incident should be complete soon. He said police 
and fire personnel followed procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jack Ford, who is black, said the drowning made more people aware of 
racial tension in the city.

BROOKLYN PROSECUTOR CALLS IT 'A TERRIFYING SOCIAL PHENOMENON'; 
</P>
<P>
ABUSE, NEGLECT OF DEPENDENT ELDERS EMERGES AS NEW 'NATIONAL PASTIME' 
</P>

<P>
Alice didn't dare wait for the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years and a bad hip weighing heavily 
-- but not as heavily as the need to get away from her 52-year-old son who was 
waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street, Alice headed for 
a neighbor's phone to let the police know that he had turned abusive again. 
</P>
<P>
"You work and support a child all your life," she said, "then they act like 
they hate you." 
</P>
<P>
Alice (not her real name) isn't alone. As many as 2 million elderly people may 
be abused, researchers say, often by their children, grandchildren, even 
great-grandchildren -- the very people they depend on for help in their old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens with these blood relatives -- sons, daughters, nieces, nephews," 
said Dorothy Brodie, a 75-year-old retired social worker who works with the 
Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Abuse Common 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do things like keep telling the victim 'You're stupid. You're senile. 
You have Alzheimer's disease.' They'll do things like maybe even taking their 
dentures away so they're forced to eat soft food; or take eyeglasses away so 
they can't even read a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
One in 25 older adults is abused, according to an estimate in a 1985 report to 
Congress, "Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace." The abuse takes all forms: 
psychological torment, neglect, theft -- and often, it is physical. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, an 18-year-old man punched and kicked his 87-year-old 
great-grandmother and later explained that: "She bugs me because she asks me to 
fix her something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
A 54-year-old salesman on Long Island was charged last year with having 
brutalized his parents for three years while demanding that they turn over 
their life savings. When they saw police arrive, neighbors asked, "Did he kill 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
"'This is a terrifying social phenomenon," said Elizabeth Holtzman, district 
attorney of the New York borough of Brooklyn, where reports of such abuse have 
risen 400% since 1986, to 370 cases last year. She attributed the increase to 
the widespread use of crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Statistics 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported nationwide, 10% more than 
in 1987, said Toshio Tatara, director of the National Aging Resource Center on 
Elder Abuse in Washington, D.C. "People still find it incredible that we abuse 
our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years ago -- and we're 
doing it like a national pastime." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tatara estimated that just one in 14 incidents is likely to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
The typical victim is 75 or older, a woman and generally dependent. The abuser 
often is a son or daughter, the congressional report said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old South Carolina woman whose daughter 
kept her in a room that was so cold the urine in a catheter froze; about a 
75-year-old retired nurse from Massachusetts whose 42-year-old son attacked him 
with a hatchet; about a San Francisco woman whose $167,000 estate was whittled 
to $3,000 by a son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are really difficult and scary, even to experienced social 
workers," said Lucy Friedman, director of the Victim Services Agency in New 
York, which helped Alice seek a temporary restraining order against her son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Blames 'the Wine' 
</P>
<P>
"I was really afraid of him," said Alice. She still bears a scar on her neck 
where her son once sliced her. "Once he gets the wine, he goes crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The abusers many times have their own problems: a drug or alcohol problem, 
being out of work, broke or mentally unstable. The violent treatment may be 
repayment for abuse that the son or daughter received as a child. A crowded 
home may spark it; middle-aged people free at last of their own children may 
resent having to take in a frail parent. In some cases, the stress of caring 
for an elderly relative is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics called to a home in San Fernando, Calif., found 77-year-old Virginia 
Grimes Jeter covered with excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died 
five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's daughter, Cynthia Jeter Green, 39, had promised her mother she 
would not put her in an old folks' home, prosecutor Lee Harris said. A 
probation report described Green as "under a degree of emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Sentenced 
</P>
<P>
She pleaded no contest to abuse charges and was ordered to get psychiatric 
counseling and perform 300 hours of community service. She did not return 
several calls from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to put their loved 
ones in a nursing home, or feel they have to be responsible for total care, is 
fairly common in these cases," Rosalie Wolf, associate director of the 
University Center on Aging at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution is getting older people to take responsibility for 
stopping, even preventing abuse, said Lee Pearson, assistant manager of 
criminal justice services for the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people should keep regular appointments and stay in touch with old 
friends, especially after moving in with a relative, Pearson said. They should 
have someone stop by once a week to make sure that all is well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Assistance 
</P>
<P>
New York's Victim Services Agency maintains a 24-hour phone line for access to 
counseling and help in court, getting locks changed, and finding shelter, 
transportation and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
In a Bronx group shelter called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what 
has happened to them and try to make sense of it. 
</P>
<P>
"People just believe and hope so much that this will be the last time, that 
things will change, he won't do it again -- but they do," said Diana Walcott, 
director of the Bronx Elder Abuse Support Project and leader of Safe Place. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents blame themselves, Friedman said. "They say 'Well, how did I bring 
up this monster?' " 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring that 
abuse be reported, but those involved with the cases say the nation has a long 
way to go toward recognizing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The states spend an average of $22 to aid each abused child, but just $2.90 for 
an abused older person, Congress found. Its report recommended emergency 
shelters, tax credits for families caring for older adults, amendments to 
Medicare and Medicaid to eliminate limits on benefits and services to elderly 
people in relatives' homes, as well as mandatory reporting of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so foreign to our thinking," said Holtzman. "Doctors won't even ask if 
abuse has taken place. It's possible the person . . . will be sent back to the 
same environment, possibly to be killed."

POLICE WHO ARRESTED HIM LOSE JOBS;

HAVING PAID DEBT TO SOCIETY, PRISON-EDUCATED LAWYER GETS REVENGE

TICONDEROGA, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wright has never forgiven the police of this historic community for their 
role in sending him to prison for two years in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't just get mad. He got even. He got more than even. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a 61-year-old self-taught lawyer, sued for dismissal of six of the nine 
members of the force, including the chief. His suit contended that they had not 
been trained or tested as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
The town fought him every step of the way, but finally gave up this year, when 
the highest New York court ruled that Wright was right. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief became a former police chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago I would have gone out and knocked these guys silly with my 
fists," said Wright, who lives and works out of two trailers near a famous 
Revolutionary War battleground. "Now, I just take the lawbooks and get them 
that way. It's better." 
</P>
<P>
His neighbors in Ticonderoga are amazed -- not to mention annoyed -- at how far 
Wright carries a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Man in Town 
</P>
<P>
The story began in 1963, when Wright left New Jersey and came here to work in a 
bar his mother owned. He said people in this rugged mountain country, 
suspicious of all outsiders, were out to get him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
About two years after Wright arrived, Horace Snow, then a state police officer, 
led a raid on the bar and arrested Wright for having an unlicensed firearm. 
Wright didn't dispute the charge, but he considered his sentence -- 3 1/2 to 7 
years in prison -- excessive. 
</P>
<P>
During Wright's "two years, two months and 28 days" in prison, his mother's 
tavern was burned to the ground in a fire that was never explained, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of prison, Wright worked in an auto parts store and maintained an 
uneasy truce with the police. He had completed a law correspondence course in 
prison and was taking classes at Adirondack Community College. 
</P>
<P>
The auto parts job didn't work out. Wright, whose wife is a school cook, raised 
money by renting out trailers on his cluttered property. In 1981, Wright fought 
with a tenant who hadn't paid her phone bill. He held the woman's stereo and 
television set until he got his money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Charges Dropped 
</P>
<P>
He also got arrested on grand larceny and possession of stolen property 
charges. Although those charges eventually were dropped, Wright didn't forget. 
</P>
<P>
He retreated into his second trailer, which was stuffed with hundreds of 
second-hand lawbooks and a home computer. 
</P>
<P>
By then Snow had retired from the state force and was chief of police in this 
community of 5,500 on the northern shore of Lake George. 
</P>
<P>
In studying laws and personnel records, Wright noticed that Snow lacked two 
years of supervisory experience and had not taken a civil service examination 
-- both required by statelaw of prospective police chiefs. Moreover, Wright 
said, Ticonderoga had not properly advertised the position when the chief's job 
was open. 
</P>
<P>
Wright also discovered that the town's three part-time police officers and two 
full-time constables had not taken the required civil service examinations 
before they were hired. 
</P>
<P>
So, he sued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partial Victory 
</P>
<P>
A state trial court in Essex County agreed that the part-time policemen should 
be fired, but said Snow and the other two officers could stay on. 
</P>
<P>
Town officials fired the three part-timers, then quickly rehired them as 
constables. Wright filed an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ticonderoga thought so little of Wright's case that the town lawyer didn't even 
drive to Albany to argue before the appellate court. Wright made his case 
before the justices himself. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, the appeals court accepted Wright's arguments. Calling Snow's 
qualifications "questionable," they ruled that he should be fired. The three 
new constables should also be let go because they were doing work they had no 
authority to do, the justices said. The other two officers had to go as well. 
</P>
<P>
The town then hired an Albany attorney to take the case to the Court of 
Appeals, New York's highest court. In February, that court refused to hear the 
case, so the ruling of the lower appeals court stood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Fired 
</P>
<P>
The next month, Ticonderoga's town board reluctantly fired Snow and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Wright is not very popular at city hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm not very fond of him," said Robert Dedrick, the town 
supervisor. "He's certainly caused the town of Ticonderoga a lot of problems." 
</P>
<P>
Dedrick is reluctant to say more because Wright has filed a lawsuit against him 
for calling him an "s.o.b." in a newspaper article. Wright has also harassed 
town officials with other lawsuits and freedom-of-information requests about 
town board decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Dedrick said that Ticonderoga hasn't added up how much Wright's lawsuits have 
cost the town. 
</P>
<P>
Wright estimated that he has spent $20,000 on the cases. He bought a copying 
machine and his shelves literally sag under the weight of his law books. He 
can't tell how many times he has traveled the two hours to Albany to file 
papers and do research. All for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a personality struggle that's frozen town government," said Fred Herbst, 
editor of the weekly newspaper, the Times of Ti. "The town government has 
accomplished virtually nothing in the last year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Officers Wanted 
</P>
<P>
Ticonderoga persisted in fighting Wright because "you don't like to see people 
lose their jobs," Dedrick said. The town now has five police officers and is 
advertising openings for others. A three-member police commission runs the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
There was some feeling that Ticonderoga should not have fought the case when 
the courts said the town wasn't following the rules, but there is not much 
sympathy for Wright, Herbst said. Most people are annoyed that he didn't look 
at the "big picture," at what it meant to the town, the newspaper editor said. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, one person who is not angry at Wright is the 62-year-old Snow, currently 
unemployed. He says no one in law enforcement holds a grudge against Wright and 
he is baffled as to why Wright thinks they do.

"I'm not too bitter about it," Snow said. "I'm that type of person. He did his 
thing. As far as I'm concerned, out of every bad comes some good." 
</P>
<P>
Snow would not say what was behind the police raid in which Wright was first 
arrested. He said Wright had gotten a court to seal the police records of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, meanwhile, is taking no chances. He has strung high-intensity 
spotlights around his property, convinced that someone will come late at night 
to get even with him. He keeps six loaded shotguns in the small trailer where 
he lives, and he carefully locks his doors. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't buy satisfaction like this," said Wright, dismissing those who say 
he carried a grudge to extraordinary lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"They did everything they can to me," he said. "They put me in jail. They 
burned my mother's bar down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like a dog -- if you tie him up and beat him every day, when you 
finally untie him he's going to bite your leg off at the knee."

Hanne and Maurice Strong come from a faster, more international track than just 
about anyone else around Crestone. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice's early years sound like a Jack London story. Born in Manitoba in 1929, 
he ran finished high school five years early and ran away from home at 13. He 
stowed away on a ship to Alaska where, at 17, he became apprentice to a fur 
trader. 
</P>
<P>
He soon started his own mining company, and his business interests 
proliferated. By age 23, he had made his first $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Strong was the first head of the Canadian International Development Agency, 
from 1966 until 1970, and the first head of Petro Canada (1976-78). 
</P>
<P>
He soon began augmenting his business expertise with environmental experience, 
and served as executive director of the United Nations environmental program, 
based in Nairobi, in the mid-1970s. In 1985, he was named executive coordinator 
of U.N. African relief operations. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual mix of capitalist developer and, as The New York Times called him in 
1975, "Custodian of the Planet," he believes there are important links between 
business and concern for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you have to be in the middle of these things," he said. "In our 
system, the market system, you affect the environment, and the only way to 
affect the environment positively is to make sure that you have environmental 
considerations built right into your business." 
</P>
<P>
When Maurice Strong first came to the Baca in 1978 after acquiring an interest 
in AZL Resources, which owned it, he knew he wanted to save it from routine 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"We were attracted by the qualities that make it so special now -- the beauty, 
the space, the fact that it's not a ski resort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strong does want to develop the water, however. He and a group of investors are 
embroiled in a heated dispute with valley water users over the investors' claim 
to what they say is a huge, untapped aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
Valley residents are skeptical of Strong's claim that the valley would benefit 
if his company sold the water to outside cities. 
</P>
<P>
Hanne Strong's interests are closer to the Baca. She says she and Maurice 
complement each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the mystical one," she said. "He's the manifester. He gets things done." 
</P>
<P>
She was born Hanne Marstrand in Copenhagen in 1941. Her father ran a fleet of 
salmon ships, and both her parents were active in the Resistance to the Nazis, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lutheran raised as a Roman Catholic, Hanne said she had mystical experiences 
early on, including seeing angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew from a very young age that I wasn't Danish, that I was Indian," she 
said. "And I knew that one day I would be with my people." 
</P>
<P>
After studying industrial and interior design in Denmark, she moved to New York 
City in her early 20s and set up a design firm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Hanne left her business and moved to Nairobi, where she had been hired 
to design Kenya's United Nations headquarters. There she met Maurice Strong. 
</P>
<P>
The couple moved to Calgary, Alberta, in 1972, where Hanne became involved in 
Indian political issues. 
</P>
<P>
When she first came to the Baca, she says, "I knew I was home." 
</P>
<P>
Hanne believes she and the Baca are creatures of both luck and destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"I like luck -- I feel I've got a lot of it," she said, "but far greater forces 
are at work, and I know it will happen. It was meant to be. We're just tools, 
and we have to perfect ourselves."

PRESIDENTIAL MUSEUMS: POPULAR STOPS ON FAMILY VACATIONS

Most visitors to the Gerald R. Ford Museum are drawn first to the full-scale 
replica of the Oval Office, but just a few feet away is the document for which 
Ford's presidency may be remembered best. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the other exhibits, this one has no accompanying audiotape or 
video; only the glass-encased paper on which Ford grants Richard Nixon a "full, 
free and absolute pardon." 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of comments on that one," Frank Mackaman, director of the Ford 
museum and library, said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hears almost as much comment about Green Bay Packers coach Curly 
Lambeau's letter offering Ford, on his graduation from the University of 
Michigan, a professional football contract. 
</P>
<P>
Such nuggets about the men who have held the nation's highest office are part 
of the lessons in American history to be learned from the eight presidential 
library-museums run by the National Archives. And plenty of priceless items of 
presidential trivia are thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y., displays FDR's 
wheelchair -- a kitchen chair with the legs cut off and wheels attached. 
</P>
<P>
At Harry S. Truman's library in Independence, Mo., there are about 150 walking 
canes that were sent to Truman from all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He carried a cane even though nothing was wrong with him, so people started 
sending him canes," Archivist Ray Geselbracht said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a drawer with hundreds of pairs of gloves that people sent the First 
Lady (Bess Truman). I don't know why, I don't think she ever wore any of them." 
</P>
<P>
At the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa, the first 
working television set is displayed -- because Hoover was the first President 
to appear on the tube. It happened in the mid-1920s, during a broadcast from 
Washington to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a photograph of Hoover fishing in a stream wearing rubber boots 
-- with a three-piece suit. 
</P>
<P>
"That man was never in casual clothes," the curator, Maureen Harding, said. 
</P>
<P>
On the premises of the Hoover, Roosevelt and Truman libraries and the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower Center in Abilene, Kan., are the Presidents' burial sites and the 
houses where they were born or lived as boys. 
</P>
<P>
About 1.2 million people, many of them schoolchildren, visited presidential 
museums in 1988, and about 9,000 researchers used the libraries, each of which 
contains millions of presidential papers and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The museums are built with private funds, but operation costs -- more than $16 
million in 1988 -- are federally subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
The Archives' establishment of a Richard Nixon library has been stalled because 
of litigation over who owns the 44 million documents, thousands of photos and 
4,000 hours of taped conversation from his Administration. Nixon is building 
his own library in Yorba Linda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan's library is scheduled to open in 1991 in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The Lyndon Baines Johnson Center, on the Austin campus of the University of 
Texas, is the largest and most popular library. It draws more than 300,000 
visitors a year; the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston is second. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a love-hate relationship with our politicians and our leaders in 
general," says James Kratsas, the newly appointed curator at the Ford museum. 
"People come here to see how government works, but also, Presidents represent a 
time in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Presidential museums are popular with group tours; some families plan their 
vacations around them. 
</P>
<P>
Kratsas, was curator at the 3-year-old Jimmy Carter museum in Atlanta before 
coming to the Ford museum, said that a day after the Carter museum opened, he 
met a San Diego family who had flown to Atlanta for the event because it was 
the only presidential museum they hadn't visited. 
</P>
<P>
Some former Presidents have been more involved than others in the direction of 
their libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Truman, who in retirement lived less than a mile from the library that honors 
him, at times would surprise schoolchildren by dropping by to give the tour 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Some classified documents are not displayed for national security reasons, but 
living former Presidents have a hand in deciding how to present the sensitive 
issues of their Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
"President Carter wanted to deal with the Iranian hostage crisis in a display. 
. . . President Ford evidently wanted to deal with the pardon," Kratsas said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ford museum, a speech written before Richard Nixon was charged with any 
crime in connection with Watergate reads: "I have the greatest confidence in 
the President, and I am absolutely positive he had nothing to do with this 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibited next to the pardon are several letters criticizing -- and just a few 
supporting -- the decision to pardon Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential library system was started by Roosevelt. Before his day, 
presidential papers, handwritten notes and memorabilia were considered personal 
items. They were kept in the Library of Congress or snatched up for university 
libraries or by private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The various cities that George Bush has called home already are fighting over 
the records of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The only presidential library not operated by the National Archives is the 
Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio, which is supported by 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Mackaman said surveys show that party affiliation has little to do with who 
visits a presidential library. It also appears to have little to do with who 
directs them, as shown in Kratsas' transferring from Carter to Ford. Carter is 
a Democrat; Ford is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have much underlying meaning," Mackaman said, "but it certainly 
proves we are a nonpartisan organization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES 
</P>

A couple is going to have to drink a lot of java between now and 1991 to redeem 
all the coupons they found in a single can of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and Dwight Spates recently found 254 discount coupons totaling $101.60 in 
a one-pound can of Sanka brand coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce was making coffee for friends, and there was a coupon in the first scoop 
out of a newly opened can, then another in the next scoop until she had pulled 
out three or four coupons," Spates said last week.

They emptied the coffee into a bowl and ended up with half a can of coffee and 
half a can of 40-cent coupons.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: S&amp;L REGULATORY SYSTEM STILL 
FLAWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Congress has finally completed legislation to stop the losses in the thrift 
industry. The taxpayers will pick up a bill for $150 billion, give or take $20 
billion or so. The failing thrifts are being taken over by the government. The 
worst will be liquidated; most of the others will be sold for their salvage 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Another crisis surmounted by wise public policy? Hardly. Some useful steps have 
been taken, but we have not seen the end of thrift industry problems. And not 
enough has been done to change the incentives that were the cause of past 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift industry failures and losses did not occur suddenly in 1989. For 20 
years, books and papers have warned about the industry's weaknesses. Most of 
this material was not hidden in obscure academic journals. It was known to 
congressmen, Treasury officials, Federal Reserve governors, presidential 
counselors and to the officials responsible for supervising and regulating the 
thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem is neither obscure nor arcane. Deposit insurance gives owners 
of thrift institutions (and banks) an opportunity to take a one-way gamble. 
Heads they win; tails the taxpayers lose. The gamble only takes that form when 
the savings and loan or bank is insolvent or has very little net worth. That's 
why the problem didn't become serious until years after academic researchers 
first spotted it. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why the failures grew. Inflation eroded the net worth of the thrift 
industry by lowering the value of the mortgages that they held. Everyone who 
took a fixed-rate mortgage in the 1960s or 1970s knows that he gained. The 
losers were the lenders -- the savings and loans that owned the mortgages. The 
end of high inflation in the early '80s and the collapse of the oil boom 
lowered the value of the mortgaged property and led to defaults. The 
accumulated losses wiped out the net worth of many thrifts. They were bankrupt. 
They remained in business, however, because deposit insurance protected them 
from bank runs. The customers had no reason to worry about the safety of their 
deposits. They were guaranteed by the government or, more accurately, by the 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy changed the incentives for the managers and operators. Risky 
investments became more attractive -- so attractive that they flocked to them 
with open pocketbooks. Alas, many of these investments didn't pay off. That's 
the way it is with risky gambles. Did the operators shut down? Not at all. Many 
paid above-market interest rates to attract large deposits and invested in 
other risky ventures. The depositors had little to fear. They were insured, so 
losses rose and the problem grew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Blame to Go Around 
</P>
<P>
The losses became so large that they wiped out the reserves set aside by the 
government's insurance fund. The government's insurer, the Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp., known as FSLIC, was itself bankrupt. By the 1980s, many 
thrifts, with government approval, were using accounting gimmicks to hide the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators mostly dithered. The Reagan Administration made a few 
unimpressive attempts to shut down the worst offenders. Congress looked the 
other way or, in some cases, pushed the regulators toward greater laxity. There 
is so much blame to go around that nothing much is said. 
</P>
<P>
This is a scandal, a government regulatory failure. The costs to the taxpayer 
are far larger than the headline-grabbing mismanagement of defense contracting 
or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The public picks up a bill 
for $600 or more per person, or $1,500 per taxpayer. And no one seems 
interested enough to take a thorough look at what can be done to prevent 
additional scandals and more losses to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit insurance has not been reformed. A few modest changes have been made, 
but a bankrupt thrift (or bank) still has an incentive to take large risks. 
And, once memories of the scandal fade, some will do so. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit insurance makes sense for small depositors, or small amounts, as 
originally intended, but not for large. The system started with a maximum of 
$2,500 per account in 1934. Adjusting for inflation, today's equivalent would 
be about $25,000. This is sufficient to protect small depositors. In 1980, 
Congress expanded deposit insurance, however, to cover deposits of up to 
$100,000. In practice, even accounts above $100,000 are often protected in case 
of failures. 
</P>
<P>
This system removes any incentive that large depositors have to keep track of 
the safety and soundness of their bank or thrift. They know that if the bank or 
thrift fails, their deposits are secure. Large firms are accustomed to 
monitoring the position of people who owe them money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Ceiling Needed 
</P>
<P>
A ceiling on deposit insurance at $25,000 would give large depositors an 
incentive to shift deposits to strong banks. Knowing that large withdrawals can 
occur would spur the manager of the bank or thrift to avoid those one-way 
gambles. Market discipline creates incentives for responsible management even 
where net worth is low. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative, favored by many observers, would have deposit insurance 
protection decline with the size of the deposit. Deposits could be fully 
insured up to $25,000, then 80% insured from $25,000 to $50,000, with lesser 
percentages on larger amounts. Or, Congress could increase incentives for 
management by raising insurance fees at risky banks. Most important of all, 
regulators should require banks to price assets at market value to the fullest 
extent possible instead of hiding losses from sight. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the Bush Administration have ignored these and many other 
proposals. Some increase in capital requirements and higher average fees for 
deposit insurance at all thrifts, whether safe or risky, and modest changes to 
encourage self-regulation are about all that the taxpayers got for their money. 
It's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the government bailout creates a new risk. When the bankrupt thrifts 
are taken over by the government, the land and buildings that have been 
foreclosed become public property. Someone has to decide when to sell, to whom 
and at what price. The opportunities for political favors are large. A 
government decision to sell creates problems for any local developer of 
competing properties, so he will have an interest in encouraging a delay in the 
selling of the foreclosed properties when he has his own properties up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Problems of this kind are not new, but the magnitude of the problem is 
unprecedented. In parts of California, Arizona and Texas especially, government 
has a lot of property to sell. 
</P>
<P>
How can the public recover the remaining value of these assets and reduce 
opportunities for more raids on the taxpayers' pocketbooks? I believe that the 
best solution is for the government to sell the foreclosed properties at public 
auction within a fixed period, say six months or a year from the time that they 
are acquired. Unless there is a fixed time schedule for sales, pressures for 
delay will be powerful. Unless properties are sold at public auction, 
opportunities for favoritism will be difficult to overcome.

Hold on to your hats, or at least your sunglasses: Acid rain may be preventing 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide, the power-plant byproduct that is the chief cause of acid rain, 
is colorless when it leaves the smokestack, but turns bright white as it 
interacts with the atmosphere. New research has raised the possibility that the 
whitening effect of sulfates from this pollution increases the albedo 
(reflectivity) of the Earth's cloud layer, causing more solar energy to be 
mirrored back into space. This would cool the atmosphere somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is no coincidence that during the very decades when artificial 
greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically increased without -- so far at least 
-- triggering a runaway world heat wave, sulfur emissions have skyrocketed too, 
keeping the planet's temperature in a kind of zany equilibrium. But consider: 
Congress is finally hitching up its pants to do something about acid rain. 
Several pending legislative proposals, including one sponsored by President 
George Bush, call for sharp reductions. There's no sign, however, of Washington 
preparing to face the music on the greenhouse effect. Slowing its advance would 
involve serious reductions in fossil fuel use coupled with other measures far 
more expensive and disruptive to the industrial world's auto-oriented life 
styles than controlling sulfur dioxide. Thus without progress against global 
warming, progress against acid rain could actually backfire. 
</P>
<P>
This possible relationship between sulfur and the greenhouse effect is 
unproved; it's strictly theory and may turn out to be wrong. But it illustrates 
the strange interrelations that can spring up when we tamper with the vastness 
of nature. 
</P>
<P>
The environment is not a machine but a living system. Like the body, it has 
some ability to adapt in response to chemical intrusions and, like the body, 
may even come to depend on substances that would otherwise be considered 
poisons. In the same manner that toxic pharmaceuticals are sometimes 
administered to counter the effects of disease microbes and other unwanted 
presences in the body, deliberate pollution may be sent chasing after the 
careless kind. 
</P>

Currently, in several Scandinavian countries, lakes are being "limed" -- bombed 
with tons of pulverized limestone -- to control the pH caused by acid rain. 
There are proposals to do this in the United States. Better to have lakes 
flavored than acidic, one supposes, but who knows what effect the lime will 
have, in turn? 
</P>
<P>
Another speculative theory on why global warming has been held in check is 
that, coming into the postwar industrial boom period, the world's oceans were 
by coincidence relatively cool. Oceans are weather moderators: The enormous 
mass of water in the sea tends to "store" temperature differences the same way 
rocks are used to store heat or cold in solar homes. If the atmosphere is 
relatively cool for some period, the sea will tend to soak that up and remain 
cool for years or decades after the weather warms -- moderating that warming 
downward. Ocean absorption of greenhouse heat may then have worked in 
opposition to global warming during recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
This effect holds, however, only until the relative coolness of the sea is used 
up. The principal evidence that oceans may be warming somewhat is recent 
variations in El Nino and other major current systems: Ocean currents are 
driven partly by temperature gradients. If indeed the sea has been forestalling 
global warming, then we're living on borrowed time -- because even if in 
decades to come humanity brings its greenhouse gas emissions under control, by 
then the oceans will have become relatively warm and will for many years exert 
the side effect of steaming up an atmosphere that would otherwise cool. 
</P>
<P>
Today the most important and scientifically irrefutable interplay of pollutants 
involves ozone. The public is continually being told that higher levels of 
ozone in smog is bad, really bad. At the same time the public is told that 
lower levels of ozone in the stratosphere is bad, really bad. Here's the 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a special molecular form of oxygen. In nature it is found only in the 
stratosphere and the vicinity of lightning -- but some pollutants, principally 
from cars and trucks, cause ozone artificially. Close to the ground, where 
people breathe it, ozone is a hazard because unlike normal oxygen, it degrades 
lung tissue. But high up in the stratosphere where it's never inhaled, ozone is 
a safeguard of terrestrial life, because it screens solar and cosmic 
ultraviolet radiation far more effectively than normal oxygen. Such radiation 
can cause skin cancer, birth defects and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
If the ozone being manufactured above our cities by smog pollutants could 
somehow be piped up to the stratosphere, two problems would be solved at once. 
Patent applications being accepted. Meanwhile, here's the maddening part. 
Chloroflurocarbons (CFCs), the pollutants principally responsible for depleting 
the ozone layer, are mainly emitted in big cities -- the same places where 
ozone is a health hazard. If only CFCs would attack the ozone in smog, another 
zany equilibrium might be established. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately CFCs are not converted into anti-ozone agents until they drift up 
into the stratosphere and are chemically altered by solar and cosmic rays. Some 
chemists have even suggested modifying CFCs so that their transformation into 
ozone-eaters would occur in low-altitude air, creating a pollutant-based 
counterbalance to smog. Unfortunately this idea would have the side effect of 
filling urban air with chlorine, a powerful caustic. Instead, the United States 
and most Western nations have signed an agreement to cut CFC manufacture 50% by 
the turn of the century, and Bush has endorsed upgrading the agreement into an 
outright ban. This issue may become moot in the United States because E.I. du 
Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., the principal manufacturer of CFCs, has announced it 
will voluntarily phase out the compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont made this commitment in part because its chemists invented a new 
substance that can replace CFCs in air conditioners and refrigeration 
equipment, the leading CFC use. Unfortunately Du Pont's creation has a 
problematic side effect. It is less efficient than CFCs -- meaning cars with 
air conditioners operating will burn more gasoline, while municipal power 
plants will consume more coal and other fuels to generate more electricity for 
cooling homes and office buildings, increasing the emission of gases with 
greenhouse effects. And, as the climate warms, it means even more fuel use for 
air conditioning, which in turn would amplify the greenhouse effect, which in 
turn . . . . 
</P>
<P>
As for zany side effects: How about a few good words for smog? Filthy air is 
not without its compensations. Studies are beginning to show that people who 
live in such badly polluted cities as Los Angeles have lower rates of skin 
cancer, blindness and certain birth defects than those who live healthful lives 
on the farm or the pristine outback -- because cosmic rays can't get through 
the smog any more than anything else can. This "portable ozone layer" effect, 
assuming it can be upheld by further research, would suggest that as 
stratospheric ozone depletion advances it may actually become healthier to tan 
yourself on Venice Beach, safely snuggled under the friendly Los Angeles smog 
dome, than in some dangerously clean place such as Hawaii or Australia. 
Assuming, that is, you bring your own breathing apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Another equilibrium question concerns deforestation. Most ecologists believe 
that it's bad to cut or burn forests because trees, like any vegetation, 
subtract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The typical ecologist would say, 
in fact, that few things are better for the Earth and its inhabitants than 
preserving the maximum acreage of forest. Recent research suggests, however, 
that under some circumstances trees are a source of hydrocarbon pollutants that 
cause smog. How it pains to think that Ronald Reagan's "killer trees" wisecrack 
might have been right. Or at least, like so many of his anecdotes, sorta kinda 
right. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a line of thought holding that logging forests is great for the 
environment, assuming each cleared area is promptly replanted. Young, growing 
trees withdraw carbon dioxide faster than mature ones. Moreover, it is possible 
that wooded stands are a net minus for the greenhouse effect compared to, say, 
using the same land for farming. Forests, being dark in color, have a low 
albedo, and so may contribute to the retention of solar warmth. Ideally one 
zany arrangement for combating global warming would call for forests to be 
continuously logged and replanted with some type of genetically engineered tree 
that grows frantically fast and has white leaves, making the brave new forest 
look, from space, like a giant daisy. 
</P>
<P>
There's no indication that radon prevents heart disease, that dioxin 
contamination is what is stopping the killer bees or any such link that would 
make pollution actually sound good. But as the 22nd-Century scientist said of 
Woody Allen's request for sprouts and carrot juice in the movie "Sleeper" -- 
"Didn't they know about hot fudge back then? The benefits of deep-fat frying?" 
-- the damage done by pollution may not stop at the obvious. There may be many 
more undiscovered -- and unwanted -- side effects.

NEW MAN, OLD ATTITUDE WILL RULE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>

<P>
In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden 
resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch 
will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get 
substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor -- 
who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new 
Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating 
crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems 
and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are 
legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and 
visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to "shut up" at 
a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South 
African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news. 
He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to "listen or get out" when the cardinal 
asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given 
Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security 
forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying. 
Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where 
he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand 
for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support 
the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning 
barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New 
York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be 
involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S. 
President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher 
measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for 
Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry 
to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text 
and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and 
segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the 
police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and 
its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the 
effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the 
resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and 
to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to 
legitimate black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one 
will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put 
employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is 
already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are 
increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of 
their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to 
protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more 
threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as 
that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a 
terrible mess. 
</P>
<P>
Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess. 
Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month 
and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from 
those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria 
for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by 
assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
and to enter into negotiations with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to 
allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist 
who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic 
costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract 
blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as 
"leaders" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This 
will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a 
national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher 
recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no 
racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly 
interjected impatiently: "What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what 
you did to them?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes 
repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years 
ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was 
fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government 
to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that 
the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in 
close touch despite their differing politics. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president 
above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious 
circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC 
has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals 
outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even 
more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each 
other about how they would relate during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such 
negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at 
a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South 
Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the 
state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the 
National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it 
was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling 
Namibian independence to South African whites. 
</P>
<P>
Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to 
arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the 
steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party 
hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A 
group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk 
when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening 
patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the 
crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: "Gentlemen, I am prepared to 
accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as 
it keeps the National Party in power." If this is indeed De Klerk's goal, God 
help South Africa.

WORDS MAKE AGENDA IN MIDDLE EAST

<P>
The Israeli capture of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a military as well as spiritual 
Shiite leader in Lebanon, has triggered renewed international interest in the 
10-year struggle between Iran and the United States. The changing circumstances 
of this struggle vividly illustrate the complex diplomatic terrain of the 
Middle East and one of its most nuanced yet highly effective weapons: words. 
</P>
<P>
Did Israel capture a "combatant" or kidnap a "hostage"? Should the 300 Shiites 
now held by Israel be viewed as "prisoners of war" or equated with the Western 
"captives" held hostage in Lebanon? How important are semantic choices in the 
Middle East conflict? 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Iranian leaders have sought to advance their respective interests by 
conveying political signals through highly nuanced messages while preserving 
flexibility of action. President George Bush and Iran's Hashemi Rafsanjani try 
to convince the other to behave differently without explicitly acknowledging 
any fundamental changes in the basic tenets of their forcefully articulated 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining flexibility is vital for both men, not only in the international 
arena, but with respect to their domestic constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a "moderate" who has advocated a more pragmatic policy toward the 
West -- including an end to Iranian efforts to export revolution -- still faces 
considerable opposition from radicals who oppose any reconciliation with the 
United States. Hezbollah receives most of its support from those radical 
factions who oppose Rafsanjani's pragmatism. Thus, Rafsanjani proclaims 
simultaneously that while he is prepared to "approach the problem reasonably," 
the United States must end its "bullying, arrogant approach" to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is also walking a high wire between domestic critics who favor immediate 
military action and those seeking political initiatives aimed at freeing 
hostages at any cost. To his credit, Bush is demonstrating statesmanship by 
deftly conveying signals of resoluteness and a readiness to use force with 
ambiguous but patient diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
These combined efforts have created a tenuous political opportunity that could 
lead to the release of the hostages in Lebanon, peace and economic recovery in 
south Lebanon and the normalization of U.S.-Iranian relations. Notwithstanding 
these hopeful developments, it should remain clear that Iran and its allies are 
at war with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There should be no ambiguity regarding the Iranian-backed Shiites' loathing of 
America and their readiness to fight the West in advancing the Shiite cause. 
Their success can be largely attributed to America's failure to act in defense 
of its national interests. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, America once again finds itself manipulated -- politically and 
emotionally -- with the media delivering the messages of our enemy. In this 
"wartime" environment, decisions by public-opinion-makers to describe Israel's 
abduction of Obeid as a "kidnaping," rather than a legitimate act of 
self-defense, or to identify Israel's Shiite prisoners as "hostages," take on 
considerable political significance. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rhetorical treatment of particular factions of Shiites in Lebanon 
as an independent, national force, exaggerates their political status in a 
country being ripped apart by Syrian and Iraqi proxies. To Lebanon's Shiite 
community, such rhetoric, whether official or unofficial, is perceived to 
reflect subtle but fundamental shifts in U.S. policy -- extending a form of 
political legitimacy to Hezbollah aspirations, strategy and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The accepted use of such charged rhetoric can only register as a victory for 
terrorism and a defeat for Western values and interests. After all, how was 
America's airborne interception of the Achille Lauro hijackers characterized -- 
as legitimate "self defense" or as unlawful "hostage-taking"? 
</P>
<P>
Not only does such careless or carefully chosen rhetoric legitimize Hezbollah's 
struggle -- by equating Israeli actions with those of lawless terrorists -- it 
exacerbates the already strained relations of Israel, the United States and the 
Western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Such strains weaken America's regional position and will make it more difficult 
to arrange some sort of prisoner exchange between Israel and Hezbollah, or to 
persuade Israel to take risks for peace in the broader context of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Another example of the important role of semantics in the struggles of the 
Middle East is the Palestine Liberation Organization's recent political 
recognition by the U.S. government and the ensuing strains in U.S.-Israeli 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO was recognized by the United States government not because it had 
changed its behavior. After all, the PLO maintained it already had renounced 
terrorism. Rather, Washington began an official dialogue with the PLO simply 
because the PLO had finally uttered the "magic words." As far as the U.S. 
government is concerned, the PLO is now a legitimate participant in the 
political dialogues. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO -- well aware how word choice can alter the process -- picks its terms 
carefully. It selects a word in Arabic to satisfy its domestic constituency but 
the English meaning is far different. In recent weeks, Al Fatah called on its 
constituents "to intensify and escalate armed action and all forms of struggle" 
against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Always seeking opportunities to enhance its international standing and achieve 
legitimacy, the PLO recently tried to achieve de facto statehood by asking to 
become a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the subsequent 
protocols. 
</P>
<P>
Whether groups other than states can be a signatory is subject to legal debate. 
But PLO semantic objectives are clear: advance the goal of 
"self-determination," the code word for an independent state, and enhance the 
status of Palestinians arrested in the occupied territories by increasing 
international pressure on Israel to treat detainees as "prisoners of war." 
</P>
<P>
In the current hostage situation, it appears likely that the United States and 
Iran, with Syria playing its "why ask me?" role, will try to inch forward in 
the coming months through a complex set of public and private diplomatic 
initiatives. Israel has offered to exchange the Shiites it holds -- including 
Obeid -- for the Israeli and Western hostages. Hezbollah seems to have said 
implicitly -- although it has also seemingly recanted -- that it will secure 
release of Western hostages if Israel first releases "its hostages." Yet the 
Iranian foreign minister says the Lebanon hostage issue doesn't concern Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Choice of words and timing are critical to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough. 
While it must be clear that Washington will use force if necessary to give 
teeth to U.S. diplomacy, a carefully conducted war of words may offer the best 
chance of achieving political results. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion-makers must choose their weapons carefully, however, in advancing or 
describing U.S. interests. As a nation we risk the lives of the hostages, 
unnecessary damage to our relationship with Israel and repeating our 
regrettable penchant for self-inflicted wounds.

COZYING UP TO RAFSANJANI BY THE WEST MAY JUST UNDERMINE IRANIAN 'MODERATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Middle East for many years.

<TEXT>
<P>
The clumsy and inopportune efforts of Western governments and the Western media 
to cast Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani in the role of the "moderate," 
"pragmatic," Anwar Sadat-like leader of Iran have helped produce the militant 
counterattack that led to his humiliation before the Majlis last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the honorific formality of presenting himself as the newly elected 
president along with his Cabinet to the Parliament, he was there informed by 
outgoing President Ali Khamenei that, according to the constitution, he would 
have to wait till October before he could step up -- and only after Khamenei 
stepped down. Rafsanjani tried to rush things, because in Iran's presently 
volatile politics six or seven weeks is an age, and he was initially rebuffed 
by his antagonists. Only two days later, on the 17th, did Rafsanjani contrive 
to get Khamenei to resign so that he himself could be sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of a power struggle after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomenei were belied by what seemed a smooth transition of power; but in fact 
the struggle went on, just below the surface, in the arcane underworld of 
mullahdom. Now it has burst into the open. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Rafsanjani was succeeded as Speaker of the Majlis by his 
deputy, Mehdi Karrubi, who, as it happens, is a leading militant and a close 
friend of Ahmed Khomeini, one of Rafsanjani's main challengers. Khomeini, son 
of the late ayatollah, is the rabble-rouser who led rioting Iranian pilgrims in 
Mecca in 1987, when 400 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The very bases of Rafsanjani's position are under challenge. He lacks solid 
political legitimacy because almost half the electorate did not vote in the 
presidential election, which was openly rigged. And he also lacks spiritual 
charisma, being a very different sort of person from the usual senior Shiite 
cleric. Rafsanjani, before entering politics under Khomeini, was a full-time 
and successful millionaire trader, managing his family's pistachio-nut 
business. It is inevitable that other ambitious Iranians, whether mullahs or 
civilian politicians, should question why this particular turbaned 
wheeler-dealer should be the leader of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Rafsanjani revealed his pro-Western tilt when he proclaimed 
that he was ready to help obtain the release of the hostages held in Lebanon. 
And for very practical reasons: He is desperate to obtain Western financial and 
technical assistance in the rebuilding of Iran's war-wrecked economy. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the militants have been warning Rafsanjani not to depart 
from "the line of the imam," which remained tough and anti-Western right to the 
end of Khomeini's life. A few days ago, Iran's largest newspaper, Keyhan, 
asserted that the purity of revolutionary principles was more important than 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The West is not helping Rafsanjani in his power struggle by prematurely and 
overeagerly praising him for his "helpfulness" and ascribing to him powers for 
speeding the release of the hostages in Lebanon which he does not actually 
possess. 
</P>
<P>
The militants in Iran are led, among others, by Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the 
minister of the interior, who felt strong enough to throw down the gauntlet to 
Rafsanjani in a recent speech from Khomeini's graveside that denounced those 
who would conciliate the United States and Israel. The day before the Majlis 
session, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei directly answered Rafsanjani's pro-Western tilt 
when he delivered a comprehensive and angry assault on the United States as the 
ally of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the struggle with the fundamentalists, Rafsanjani is in an infinitely weaker 
position than was Sadat vis-a-vis his fundamentalists. Egypt was, and is, a 
secular state and the Egyptian Muslim activists, after their suppression by 
President Gamal Abdel Nasser, were small groups working underground, able to 
obtain arms and explosives only with difficulty. In contrast, Iran for the past 
10 years has been a full-fledged and militant Islamic state with anti-Western 
fundamentalism as the political mainstream. This was backed with all the power 
and charisma of the imam and has been accepted not just by scores or hundreds 
or thousands of people but by hundreds of thousands, even millions, of devout 
believers as their religious and political creed. 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, the militants were on the outside attacking the Establishment; in 
Iran a militant Establishment will have to make a 180-degree turn if it is to 
accept Rafsanjani's pro-Western, anti-militant policies. 
</P>
<P>
There is as much adversarial factionalism down the chain of command from Tehran 
to the Shiite groups in Lebanon holding the hostages as there is at the top 
layer of political power in Tehran itself. Thus, some personalities in Tehran 
have their own especially close personal links with certain factions and 
leaders in Hezbollah, the Party of God, in Lebanon; in turn, the Hezbollah 
leaders have their special connections with one or another hostage-holding 
group and these may be based, variously, in the suburbs of Beirut, in the Bekaa 
Valley or in southern Lebanon; groups have differing interests and objectives 
depending on their geographic location. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the Shiites in southern Lebanon are not as involved in the hostage issue 
as those based in Beirut or the Bekaa. So any order from Rafsanjani has to 
follow a tortuous path to its ultimate recipient in Lebanon. This is further 
complicated by the fact that on the ground in Lebanon, most of what may be 
called Shiite territory is controlled by the Amal organization, which is 
pro-Syrian, anti-Hezbollah and not especially friendly with Tehran. For 
example, when Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual mentor of 
Hezbollah in Beirut, made a "helpful" statement on the hostages Aug. 11, he was 
at the same time contradicted by Sheik Sobhi Tufaili, addressing 50,000 Shiites 
at Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These splits and differences within the Iran-Lebanon Shiite structure have to 
be combined with geography: Iran is far removed from Lebanon, with the links 
between them passing exclusively through Syria, which has its own 
intergovernmental differences with Tehran. Moreover, there is a gut feeling of 
alienation between the non-Arab, Farsi-speaking Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
and the Semitic, Arabic-speaking "terrorists"; the Iranians have not endeared 
themselves to the local population by their crude and arrogant behavior. 
</P>
<P>
This complex of negative factors makes one wonder, when the West confidently 
backs Rafsanjani as a person who will deliver up the hostages, whether it has 
the least idea of the actual situation in Lebanon, or whether it is simply 
whistling in the dark to keep its courage up. The West seems to have learned 
nothing from its Sadat experience, when it embraced him to death.

L.A. COUNTY BORES

I recently returned from Sacramento after having taken a tour of the Capitol. 
One highlight is the display from each California county, showing pictures of 
beautiful vacation spots in that county, or businesses in the county such as 
agriculture or wine. Most had small maps with popular locations marked. 
</P>
<P>
All were interesting, informative and created a desire to visit that county 
except one. It was a shrine to the county supervisors, with their names and 
pictures as the focal point. It was L.A. County. Gee, I wonder whose idea that 
was?

My home was one that survived the Puente Hills fire July 3. I returned home 
that evening to find it had been saved from total loss by a fine group of brave 
young men from Camp Paige. I watched them and they were determined not to give 
up. I still have a home, and I'm filled with gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
I would like all your readers to know that those young men from Camp Paige, 
among all the other firemen and firefighters, deserve special recognition and a

INVADING THE INITIATIVE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most distressing features of California's current political 
landscape is the way in which ambitious office seekers have appropriated the 
people's indispensable guarantor of direct democracy, the initiative, and 
turned it into a private tool of campaign technology. By doing so, these 
politicians hope to portray themselves as champions of popular issues and to 
circumvent the legal limits on campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, nearly every candidate for statewide office in both parties now is 
sponsoring or endorsing one or more initiatives. For example, Sen. Pete Wilson, 
the probable Republican nominee for governor, has linked his electoral fortunes 
to a proposed ballot proposition called The Crime Victims' Justice Reform Act, 
which would make sweeping changes in California's criminal justice system. 
Other versions of this measure, which is a compendium of ill-advised proposals 
prudently rejected by the Legislature over the past decade, have been 
circulated twice since 1984, and then withdrawn for lack of popular support. 
This year, Wilson -- mindful of the public's anxiety over crime -- has given 
the proposal's backers several hundred thousand dollars they could not raise 
from the people on their own. That money currently is being used to fund a 
campaign to gather enough signatures to finally put the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
We believe, however, that those Californians who are properly informed of this 
initiative's implications will refuse to sign it. And, if by some misfortune it 
does make its way onto the ballot, it should be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the title concocted by its authors, this dangerous and destructive 
proposal will do nothing for the victims of crime. It will, on the other hand, 
recklessly abolish Californians' recourse to their own state's constitution as 
a protector of their rights. Among the safeguards thus abrogated will be the 
right of women and their physicians to invoke the California Constitution's 
separately enumerated right to privacy as a shield against anyfuture attempt to 
recriminalize abortion in this state. If passed, this measure also would create 
a dual system of justice in which judges would be forced to accord individuals 
wealthy enough to retain lawyers one set of rights, while holding people of 
modest means, forced to rely on appointed counsel, to another, more restrictive 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if the initiative's so-called speedy trial provisions actually were 
implemented, Californians would be forced to choose between shutting down their 
system of civil courts so that criminal cases could be heard at a greater rate 
or spending tens of millions of dollars to build new courts and staff them with 
hundreds more judges, public defenders and appointed private lawyers. In fact, 
truth in advertising ought to compel this measure's authors to call it The 
Lawyers' Full Employment Act. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's proponents argue that all this must be done to bring 
California's criminal justice system into conformity with that of the federal 
government. This, they claim, will ensure swifter and surer punishment of 
criminals. However, as legal scholar Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara 
University School of Law, has pointed out, this state already does a better job 
of resolving criminal cases than does the federal system: "California currently 
disposes of 10 times as many felony cases per year as the federal courts, with 
only 1 1/2 times as many judges," says Uelmen. "In federal courts, only 75% of 
felony cases are disposed of by a guilty plea. In California, the rate is 95%." 
</P>
<P>
If this ballot proposition were to become law, the people of California would 
be needlessly deprived of this advantage. They would not only suffer the 
diminution of their rights as citizens of this state, but also be forced to 
finance it out of an already overtaxed public treasury. That is a very steep 
price to pay simply to further the ambitions of a few politicians and 
prosecutors.

CATHOLICISM AND LATIN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to "A Continental Shift." 
</P>
<P>
In today's world, Christian faith is an option which evokes other options. 
Faith matures as this option is faced. Protestantism may have the attraction of 
being a new option for many Latin Americans. If, in exploring this option, a 
deepened Christian faith results, the Catholic Church is enriched. What 
benefits Christianity is good for both Protestants and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Conversion is the turning toward God and away from sin. Only in a superficial 
way does conversion have to do with changing one's denomination. It is entirely 
thinkable to the modern Catholic that a person's sincere search for deeper 
connection with God could take them into another denomination. Denominations 
are more different styles of being Christian than opposing and mutually 
intolerant camps. 
</P>
<P>
The jewel of Christianity is many-faceted, and may be viewed through many 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Many Christians in Latin America are . . . forming base communities and probing 
into their personal and common experiences of grace through prayer, sacrament, 
and social action. This is the true reality of conversion, regardless of the 
denomination in which it happens. Where the world is enriched through God's 
grace and human response to it, there is the church and there is the gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Evangelical Christianity can meet the needs of the Latin spirit 
in the sphere of social action and political liberation needs to be seen. For 
now we know that its private spirituality and emotional approach are attractive 
to many. We also know that Catholicism worldwide is more attuned to individual 
conscience, selective acceptance, and the priesthood of all believers. As for 
the saints, we know they protect Protestants as well as Catholics.

IT'S MOSCOW'S WEAPONS FIGHTING LEBANON'S WAR, SO MOSCOW MUST STEP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN P. HANNAH, John P. Hannah is deputy director of the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the summer of 1982, as Israeli troops and artillery laid siege to Beirut, 
the international community wasted no time in demanding that the United States 
act to restrain its ally. Now, seven years later, with Syrian troops inflicting 
what is by all accounts a much more devastating horror on Beirut, world opinion 
should act with equal haste and call to account Syria's paymaster, the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever view one takes of the current conflict in Lebanon, which pits Syria 
and its Muslim proxies against the Christian forces of Lt. Gen. Michel Aoun, 
one thing is indisputable: No outside power -- not the United States, not the 
United Nations, not the Arab League, not Israel, not France -- has more 
leverage to achieve an immediate cease-fire than the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Syria's military is almost totally dependent on arms and funding from the 
Soviet Union. Before Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985, Moscow 
supplied Syria with about $3 billion worth of weapons annually. Since 1985, 
with the advent of Soviet "new thinking" and Syria's economic collapse, a 
greater austerity has been introduced to the relationship, though Soviet arms 
continue to flow to Syria at the impressive rate of $1 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
Syria's military dependence on Moscow represents the Kremlin's most significant 
lever of influence on the fighting in Lebanon, but not its only one. The 
Soviets are also the main arms supplier and superpower patron of Iraq, whose 
massive weapons transfers to Lebanon's Christian forces have buttressed the 
ill-considered belligerency of Gen. Aoun. As it does with Syria, Moscow 
maintains a so-called treaty of friendship and cooperation with Iraq, a 
long-term political/military agreement that borders on a formal alliance. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the carnage in Beirut is being carried out almost entirely on behalf 
of parties that are, in one form or another, allied with and armed by the 
Soviet Union. Under the circumstances, Moscow's unique responsibility to play a 
leadership role in efforts to halt the bloodshed cannot be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the United States has done everything in its power to 
alleviate Lebanon's suffering. It has not. But given Moscow's ties to Syria, 
and the fact that the war is being waged with Soviet weapons, the Kremlin has 
both a greater capability and moral duty to affect the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it to say that the Soviets have been unhelpful in recent attempts to end 
the fighting. Quite the contrary. In May, the Soviet Union joined the United 
States in a statement that urged all of Lebanon's warring factions to agree to 
an immediate cease-fire. In July, a similar call was issued by Gorbachev and 
French President Francois Mitterrand. Moscow backed the mediation efforts of 
the Arab League (which failed) as well as last week's Security Council 
cease-fire appeal, which produced at least a pause in the combat. And a month 
ago, the Kremlin saw fit to send a deputy foreign minister to Damascus and 
Baghdad on a mission of quiet diplomacy aimed at de-escalating the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the changes that he has wrought in Soviet foreign policy more 
generally, Gorbachev's actions in Lebanon have clearly been in support of 
efforts to ameliorate the conflict. But alas, to date, these have been the 
actions that one would expect from a medium-size power. They have not been the 
actions of a superpower whose military and political weight with the main 
combatant in Lebanon's civil war, Syria, far outstrips that of any other 
possible mediator. Even more to the point, they have not been the actions of a 
superpower that claims a responsibility equal to the United States' for 
maintaining and enhancing international peace and stability. 
</P>
<P>
With all other attempts to stem the fighting in Lebanon having foundered, and 
with Syria posed to impose a final solution on Christian East Beirut, the 
international community should now call on the Soviet Union to step up to the 
challenge of world leadership. Moscow must be urged to act, forcefully and 
without delay, by bringing the full weight of its political leverage to bear on 
Syria to agree to a cessation of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
This is no more than the United States was asked to do vis-a-vis Israel in 
1982. Today, when the Soviet Union is demonstrating itself to be a far more 
responsible international actor, it would be a shame if a double standard were 
employed and less was expected of the Kremlin when its ally flouts 
international sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years go, President Ronald Reagan telephoned Israeli Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin and demanded that the Israeli assault on Beirut be brought to a 
stop. President Gorbachev should now be urged to place a similar call to 
Damascus. Lebanon's survival depends on it.

WARSAW AND MOSCOW WALK ONTO SHAKY SOIL; 
</P>
<P>
FOR BOTH, SOLIDARITY IN POWER IS A HUGE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BERNHARD, Michael Bernhard is as assistant professor of political 
science at Pennsylvania State University.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a moment of both keen insight and black humor during World War II, Josef 
Stalin remarked that the idea of creating socialism in Poland was akin to 
putting a saddle on a cow. 
</P>
<P>
Had he fully appreciated the wisdom of his joke, both Poland and the Soviet 
Union would, no doubt, be better off today. Poland has been the most unstable 
country in Moscow's Eastern European empire and, due to Poland's key strategic 
location, this has been acutely felt. 
</P>
<P>
Yet last week, Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski approved the formation of a 
coalition government led by the Solidarity movement. With the participation of 
two small parties formerly subservient to the Polish Communists -- the 
Democrats and the United Peasants -- this government will control both the 
lower and upper houses of the Polish Parliament. The cabinet will include at 
least two Communist ministers, who will hold the crucial portfolios of interior 
and foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
This is yet another link in a chain of remarkable and unexpected developments 
in Poland. But it is probably too soon to be euphoric. The cow has not been 
completely unsaddled. 
</P>
<P>
When the Communists sat down with Solidarity representatives for their 
round-table discussions last March, expectations for a political breakthrough 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity was relegalized and allowed to contest a significant number of seats 
in parliamentary elections. Its trouncing of the Communists in head-to-head 
competition made it possible for an Eastern European government -- the first 
one in 40 years -- to be led by a non-Communist politician. Yet as late as last 
week, this result was seen as outside the realm of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
During the competitive scrambling to put together a ruling coalition, 
Jaruzelski had stated that Moscow would not look favorably upon a 
Solidarity-led government. Then the Soviet Foreign Ministry contradicted him by 
reiterating a statement that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made to the 
Council of Europe earlier this year: "Any interference in domestic affairs and 
any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states -- friends, allies or any 
other -- are inadmissible." 
</P>
<P>
So it is Gorbachev who has radically altered the rules of politics in Eastern 
Europe. If the Soviets abide by their statements, Poland will regain its 
internal sovereignty within the framework of the Warsaw Pact. If the Soviets 
can permit this in Poland, it is possible in every other country in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles have prudently chosen not to test the limit of their autonomy in 
external affairs. Lech Walesa made a point of stressing that Poland would not 
leave the Warsaw Pact. Gorbachev seems to have come to the conclusion that, 
from the point of view of Soviet security needs, a Warsaw Pact composed of 
internally autonomous, politically stable allies is preferable to one made up 
of politically volatile, economically deteriorating, ideologically orthodox 
vassal states. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in both Moscow and Warsaw, the foundations on which this rapidly changing 
relationship hinges are shaky. In the Soviet Union, the continued deterioration 
in conditions on the consumer market are undermining popular support for 
Gorbachev and his program of perestroika. If grumbling turns into labor unrest 
on a scale beyond the recently settled strikes in coal-mining regions of 
Siberia and the Ukraine, if the Soviet nationality problems grow worse, or if 
change in Eastern Europe takes on a violent or explicitly anti-Soviet 
character, the hand of hard-liners opposed to Gorbachev may grow stronger. Thus 
Gorbachev needs peaceful and orderly political change in Eastern Europe. If he 
is removed or is forced to curtail his policies, the tolerance for political 
experimentation in Poland may disappear. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, the most pressing task for the Solidarity government will be to 
reform the moribund Polish economy. For this reason, taking power is a huge 
political risk. Any economic reform and austerity program that Solidarity 
pursues will, in the short run, hurt Polish society and the working class. It 
is unclear as to whether the union's popular support is extensive enough to 
prevent more radical opposition groups from threatening potentially beneficial 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Should Solidarity's future economic reforms fail outright, the union will face 
threats from many corners. Its popular support will certainly begin to wane. 
Internally, it will be beset by recrimination and centrifugal pressures. If 
such a scenario comes to pass, Solidarity will have to worry about the 
dissolution of the governing coalition, the splitting of the union, defeat at 
the polls during the next scheduled elections in 1993, the growth in strength 
of the more radical opposition groups, or even a coup d'etat by hard-line 
elements in the Communist Party, army and police. Such a failure by Solidarity 
would not be of much help to Gorbachev's political career, either. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating the situation is the question of whether the decisions 
that the new government makes will be quickly and wholeheartedly implemented. 
Nobody knows if the state bureaucracy, whose interests are closely intertwined 
with the Communist Party, will listen to Solidarity ministers. In the past, the 
most crucial positions have been filled only by those who have had the overt 
approval of the party. This nomenklatura system has been one of the key 
bulwarks of party rule. Solidarity will want and will have to replace such 
people. Finding enough suitably trained replacements from among Solidarity's 
supporters and the time it will take to make such a transition pose additional 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
At this time the Bush Administration, in concert with our Western European 
allies, must move decisively to help Poland stabilize itself economically. The 
$100 million that the President promised on his trip to Poland earlier this 
summer is much too little. The Polish debt must be restructured so that it does 
not doom Solidarity from the outset. Economic assistance, particularly to 
revive Polish agriculture and create modern consumer and light industry, is 
indispensable to assure social peace. Finally, programs should be established 
as quickly as possible to help train Solidarity cadres to run the state 
bureaucracies.

ASIAN NEWCOMERS WHO 'GET AHEAD SO FAST' MAY BE FAR BEHIND WHERE THEY STARTED 
</P>

By RONALD TAKAKI, Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, 
is the author Strangers From a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans, 
(1989).

<TEXT>
<P>
In Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing," three unemployed black men are 
sitting on the sidewalk in a New York City black community, and one of them 
points to the Korean greengrocery across the street. Those Koreans, the Lees, 
own that store, he says. And they got off the boat only a year ago. Why we 
can't do the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
But the question is left unanswered. We leave the theater with little 
understanding of why the three men are out of work and why the Lees are 
operating a store. 
</P>
<P>
Had Spike Lee allowed his viewers to enter the back room of the greengrocery we 
might have seen a college degree from a Korean university hanging on the wall 
and learned that grocer Lee may have been a professional worker -- an engineer, 
school teacher or administrator -- in Korea. About 78% of Korean greengrocers, 
a New York survey found, had college degrees. In the mid-1970s, only 6% of 
Korean householders in New York City had been small-business owners in the old 
country. Yet, 34% of them were in the retail and wholesale businesses. They 
became shopkeepers after their arrival in America. 
</P>
<P>
"What else can I do?" explained greengrocer Ill Chung, who holds a master's 
degree in engineering. "I need money but there are not good jobs for Koreans." 
Korean professionals such as Chung face discrimination, and, even if they are 
hired, many hit the "glass ceiling" -- a barrier that allows them to see 
high-level management positions but not reach them. 
</P>
<P>
Most Korean immigrants also encounter another difficulty. "The English-language 
barrier," observed one of them, "virtually makes the (Korean) newcomers deaf 
and dumb." According to a 1975 study of Korean immigrants over 23 years of age, 
only 10% were fluent in English. As greengrocers, Korean immigrants need only a 
minimal knowledge of English to operate their business. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason why they are able to "own" stores is the fact that they often 
bring capital with them. "They sell their homes, everything they own in Korea 
and bring their cash with them," explained Christopher Kim, who has worked as a 
lawyer in Los Angeles' Koreatown for over a decade. "Many then open liquor 
stores in the black community." 
</P>
<P>
But most do not become shopkeepers. Instead they find themselves trapped as 
stockers and clerks in grocery stores, service workers in restaurants, 
operatives in garment factories or as janitors at airports and in hotels. "We 
came for a better life," complained garment-factory worker Jung Sook Kim, "but 
we have not found it better yet. It is work, work, work." 
</P>
<P>
The highlighting of Korean shopkeeping success by Spike Lee and also by the 
news media has overlooked the plight of these Korean laborers. This has helped 
create the myth of Koreans and other Asian Americans as a "model minority." 
Although many achievements in education and employment by Asian Americans have 
indeed been impressive, they should not be allowed to shroud other realities 
that exist. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of the New York Chinatown population lived below the 
poverty level in 1980, compared to 17% for the city. From 50% to 70% of the 
workers in Chinatowns in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York are crowded 
into low-paying jobs in garment factories and restaurants. "Most immigrants 
coming into Chinatown with a language barrier cannot go outside this confined 
area into the mainstream of American industry," said Danny Lowe describing what 
happened to him. "Before, I was a painter in Hong Kong, but I can't do it here. 
I got no license, no education. I want a living, so it's dishwasher, janitor or 
cook." 
</P>
<P>
Hmong and Mien refugees have an unemployment rate that reaches 90%. A 1987 
California study showed that 3 in 10 Southeast Asian refugee families have been 
on welfare for 4 to 10 years. "We have no other skills but farming -- except 
that we are not even farmers anymore," said a Hmong refugee. Referring to the 
enlistment of the Hmong by the CIA in the "secret war" in Laos, he added: "We 
are just unemployed soldiers." While thousands of Vietnamese young people are 
entering universities as "whiz kids," others are on the streets. They live in 
motels and hang out in places like the Midnight Cafe and the Saigon Center pool 
hall in the San Gabriel Valley east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
College-educated Asian Indians can be seen working in luncheonettes featuring 
Indian "fast food" and operating newsstands in Manhattan subways. Filipino 
immigrants can be found in food and health services: In San Francisco, their 
employment rate in these occupations is 21% percent, compared to 6% for whites. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, even Korean immigrant "success" has been exaggerated. In San 
Francisco, for example, Korean-immigrant men in 1980 earned only 60% of what 
their white counterparts earned. The figure for black men was 68%. 
</P>
<P>
To do the right thing we also need to see the world from the other side of 
greengrocer Lee's counter.

ACTIVISTS ARE URGING LOW-COST HOUSING AT AUTO PLAZA SITE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. William R. Johnson Jr. is among a group of community activists 
promising to muster 1,500 people for a rally this afternoon to pressure city 
officials to sell a site alongside the Artesia Freeway for low-cost homes. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Benson Sr. is a member of Johnson's Curry Temple congregation and a 
city planning commissioner. Benson says he will fight "tooth and nail" against 
selling the site for housing. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, in what could become a bitter confrontation among people who all 
believe they have the city's interest at heart, is how to best use a 55-acre 
parcel in the southern end of the city where Compton Auto Plaza now stands. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the city has been pinning its revitalization dreams on 
the site and pouring its redevelopment resources into it. Today, though, just 
one auto dealership is operating on the site; a 288-room hotel that was to open 
there a year ago has been stalled several times by financing and construction 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner-Occupied Townhouses 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson and other members of the South Central Organizing Committee (SCOC) 
see it, an owner-occupied townhouse development with peaceful, tree-lined 
streets would provide inexpensive housing and also show Compton residents that 
"gangs and drugs do not have to control the area, that (residents) can control 
it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agrees that city officials have the responsibility to see that the land 
is used in ways of greatest benefit for the community. "But we are saying that 
many of the suggested uses they are proposing are more like pipe dreams than 
they are practical," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Benson says: "We're trying to build a tax base for the city." Pressuring an 
economically disadvantaged city such as Compton to sell its most valuable 
commercial land at a discount for housing, he says, would be "pitting poor 
against poor." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the site attractive to SCOC, an activist group working in Compton 
and several other Southland inner-city areas, is the same thing that makes the 
site so valuable for development. 
</P>
<P>
Street and other improvements are already in place. And freeway access is good: 
The land is alongside the Artesia, a major east-west traffic artery, and a mile 
or two from two other major freeways -- the Harbor to the west and the Long 
Beach to the east. In addition, the light-rail line that is to begin operating 
next year will stop at the site. The station has already been built. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nuby, redevelopment project director for the site, says: "The city has 
a direct need for a development that is income-generating and, basically, the 
(housing) would not bring the economic return to the city that 
retail/commercial development would." 
</P>
<P>
Several developers, Redevelopment Manager Cynthia Coleman says, are knocking on 
the city's door asking to locate on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The council is trying to determine the best use of the site, she says, with the 
plan to develop a new auto plaza largely abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
At the afternoon rally at Compton Auto Plaza, SCOC leaders say they will ask 
the city to hold off making commitments to developers for 120 days to give the 
organization time to conduct an an independent study of the site. 
</P>
<P>
The SCOC, Johnson says, proposes that the city sell 10 to 12 acres on the north 
side of the property along Greenleaf Avenue. To make homes affordable to people 
with annual incomes of less than about $26,000, SCOC leaders say, hundreds of 
homes must be built at once in assembly-line fashion, which would require a 
large, vacant site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money for Construction 
</P>
<P>
Another key to the success of a low-cost housing development, SCOC says, is a 
pool of money to pay for construction. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has committed $3 million of the Los 
Angeles Archdiocese to develop low-cost housing and has promised to raise $5 
million more. Bishop E. Lynn Brown of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church 
has promised $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
SCOC is also considering sites in South-Central Los Angeles for low-cost 
housing, which would be modeled after a successful development in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also says it would have to buy land for the homes at a 
discount. Compton officials say the city has tried that approach for two 
decades to encourage new development, but several failures have made officials 
and residents wary of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Maxcy D. Filer says: "As I understand it, the council is not in 
a mood to give any write-downs or give any more land away." 
</P>
<P>
Filer says he has told SCOC leaders who approached him about the housing 
development that the best use for the land would be commercial, which would 
allow the city to reap sales tax revenues and also provide jobs for its 
residents, a quarter of whom receive some sort of public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore -- who ousted longtime incumbent Floyd A. James 
in the April 16 election, in part, she says, because residents were unhappy 
with the council giveaways -- echoes Filer's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a need for affordable housing, because we're a poor 
community," she says. "I'm just not sure that's the best site." 
</P>
<P>
Moore also points out that the city's lower-income homeowners are paying much 
higher property taxes than residents in surrounding cities because Compton's 
only source of tax revenue is from property. A commercial tax base is 
important, she says, to bring in sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Reuben Anderson, another SCOC leader and pastor of Tower of Faith 
Evangelistic Church in Compton, says the city will never be able to attract 
businesses until it "stabilizes" its population. Most current residents are 
renters, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The city, Anderson says, "has had a shot" at trying to draw development to 
Compton. Now it should consider the SCOC plan to create a community of 
homeowners who would have a "vested, instead of an investment" interest in the 
city.

CITIES LAVISH PRAISE ON 12-YEAR-OLD HERO WHO SAVED 2 BOYS FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though he has been interviewed by television reporters, congratulated by 
friends and honored by city officials, 12-year-old James Lewis has not gotten 
used to being hailed as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird," said Lewis, who is more comfortable riding his bicycle or playing 
basketball with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrust into the limelight in May when he snuffed out flames that 
threatened the lives of two boys who had been set on fire accidentally. Another 
youth playing with gasoline in the parking lot of the Atlantis Motel, where all 
three lived, caused the fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standing Ovation 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Cudahy City Council awarded Lewis a commendation. More than 150 
people gave him a standing ovation during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' commendation is believed to be the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy has "given awards to police officers, but this is probably the first 
citizen," City Clerk Ebbie Mouton said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Lewis also received an Heroic Action Award from officials in nearby 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Outstanding Future Leader' 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was described as "an outstanding future leader" of Bell and Cudahy in the 
commendation presented to him by Bell city officials and Police Chief Manuel E. 
Ortega of the Bell-Cudahy Police Department, which provides police services to 
both cities. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said two policemen who came to his school to tell him "You did a good 
deed," each gave him $5 and told him to buy "hamburger, fries and a Coke." 
</P>
<P>
The youth passed up the food and purchased a T-shirt and some shorts with the 
$10. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a student at Nimitz Junior High School in Huntington Park, lives at the 
low-rent Atlantis Motel with his parents, Helen Acuna and James Lewis Sr., and 
four other sisters and brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was in the motel's parking lot on May 15 when a 14-year-old youth lit a 
match near gasoline that he had poured onto the asphalt, police said. The 
flames leaped around the two children who were playing there. Lewis beat out 
the fire with his bare hands and threw Raul Silav, 10, to the ground, 
smothering the fire in the boy's clothing. He then pulled a burning jacket off 
Phil Kowal Jr., 6. Kowal received first- and second-degree burns on his face, 
neck and left arm. Silav and Kowal have since moved out of the motel. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old, who police declined to identify, was arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon but was later released. The 
fire was determined to be an accident, police Cmdr. Steve Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ortega said of Lewis: "His quick, courageous action certainly 
reduced the injury to the 6-year-old, and very likely saved the lives of both 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
And why did Lewis do it? 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to see anyone burned," said Lewis, who wants to be a 
professional basketball player like his hero Byron Scott of the Los Angeles 
Lakers.

NEIGHBORS OBJECT TO NOISE, USE OF SPRAYS AT NURSERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Holliman retrieved a white gallon bottle of bleach from behind her 
washing machine and pointed to the thick layer of dust that had accumulated 
near the cap. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has recently been having coughing fits after being out on the 
enclosed patio of her home along Stevely Avenue near Carson Street. "When I 
dust out here, I have spasms," she added. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, Martha Holliman said, she and her husband, James, lived 
comfortably in the shady, peaceful neighborhood. Then in January, a wholesale 
nursery expanded into the lot behind their back fence, an area that had been 
used only as a right of way for high-voltage power lines. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Holliman said, the dust has been so bad that she must cover her 
interior and patio furniture with plastic sheets. She said the drift from 
pesticide spraying has twice nauseated her. 
</P>
<P>
The nursery "has caused so much stress that my husband and I don't even want to 
live here anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents have similar complaints. One woman believes that rashes on her 
face are from the pesticide; a couple, fearing that their children will be 
exposed to pesticides, limit playtime in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said nursery workers have created dust, sang or played loud music, 
honked truck horns and generally made so much racket that back-yard barbecuing 
has been curtailed. Residents recently told City Councilman Les Robbins at a 
community meeting that the nursery should be evicted from the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, whose district includes Stevely Avenue, said he will suggest Tuesday 
that the full City Council request the right of way owner, the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, to declare the nursery expansion a nuisance and 
remove it. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins acknowledged that Los Angeles County agricultural and health 
officials have found no evidence of illegal or improper practices at the 
nursery. Officials have determined that the nursery uses approved pesticides 
and proper spraying procedures, according to documents received by Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
And a county Department of Health Services toxics specialist found that 
Holliman's nausea "was not a true pesticide poisoning, but rather a 
physiological response to an obnoxious odor." 
</P>
<P>
The nursery's owner said he is making every effort to be a good neighbor and 
has changed many operating procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to work with the neighbors, and we're being unfairly treated by 
the councilman so he can get his name in the paper," said David Sasuga, 
president of Sunrise Growers. "We're just getting a lot of bad publicity, and 
we're getting unfairly persecuted here." 
</P>
<P>
Sunrise has occupied the east bank of the San Gabriel River, just north of the 
Police Pistol Club of Long Beach, for seven years. But the disputes with the 
neighbors started only in January, when the nursery leased several more acres 
on the west bank from the Los Angeles city department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labored Late Into Night 
</P>
<P>
Residents said workmen started appearing a few feet from their back fences and 
labored late into the night. Some said they could actually see the vapor from 
pesticide spraying wafting over their back-yard fences. 
</P>
<P>
"It just concerns me," said Ricardo Menchaca, who lives in his Stevely Avenue 
home with wife Donna and their sons, 3 years and 8 months old. "I don't know 
what those chemicals can do. Without any scientific study, there is a margin of 
error. What is the margin of error, and does it put children at risk?" 
</P>
<P>
Donna Menchaca said she limits her children's back-yard activities to times of 
day when she can see there is no pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have a home, and we can't have full use of the property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Isabelle McBeth said that the spraying causes breathing problems and that her 
sister, with whom she lives on Stevely Avenue, developed facial rashes. She 
also complained about noise and dust. 
</P>
<P>
"People can't go out and enjoy their back yards," she said. "They are seeing a 
big conglomerate business out there." 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents signed a petition against the nursery operation, owner 
Sasuga said some residents have told him that they like the pretty flowers over 
their back fences. He said his crews removed truckloads of debris from the 
empty lot before converting it to a nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide spraying has been cut back, a 20-foot buffer has been established 
between the beds and neighbors' back fences and crews have been told not to 
work late at night and to be quiet, Sasuga said. Indeed, the loudest noises in 
the neighborhood Thursday morning were gunshots at the police pistol range. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water and Power lease to Sunrise Growers is part of a 
successful program to find suitable uses for land under power lines, said Frank 
Kobashi, senior real estate officer for property management. 
</P>
<P>
The leases not only generate revenue but keep the land free of weeds and trash, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to remove them (the nursery). They're good and competent," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Stevely Avenue residents may be so used to having the vacant lot behind 
their back fences that "they consider that to be their property." 
</P>
<P>
But department officials have decided to reject a nursery plan to expand again 
to another section on the river's west bank, Kobashi said. 
</P>
<P>
When told of the decision to limit further expansion, Sasuga said he was 
disappointed. He said he intends to try to be a good neighbor, even if it means 
contacting each Stevely Avenue resident and asking what he can do to allay 
concerns.

CHRISTIAN POLICE SERGEANT SEES SATAN AS AN ADVERSARY IN CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
First came the 18-year-old La Puente machinist who shot himself with a 
.22-caliber rifle in 1984 while a tape of Ozzy Osbourne's "Diary of a Madman" 
blasted heavy metal anthems from his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, a partially burned voodoo doll with pins in its groin and heart 
was found nailed to the back door of a Baldwin Park dressmaking shop. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1987, seven people were arrested for ransacking an El Monte warehouse, 
where they painted "Suicidal Death Tribe" in giant letters on the wall and 
jammed a dead rat through the plaster. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, a Covina teen-ager pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty 
after he and a friend were accused of mutilating several cats and using the 
blood to scrawl "666" on an elementary school wall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Youths 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, they were all just troubled youths hoping to shock the rest of the 
world into paying them attention. But Randy Emon did not think so. 
</P>
<P>
Emon, a Baldwin Park police sergeant with 18 years on the force, saw a darker 
side to those incidents, a suspicion that has launched him on a bizarre and 
spiritually turbulent journey into the world of occult-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Emon has become a leading authority among a small but growing 
number of occult specialists whose expertise in such practices as satanism, 
witchcraft and Santeria is increasingly in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
Through his course at Rio Hondo College and consulting jobs, he estimates he 
has trained more than 600 California police officers in recognizing ritualistic 
crimes. Adding church and civic groups, he figures that at least 20,000 people 
have heard him lecture about animal mutilation, necrophilia and human 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Emon, a "born-again" Christian and father of three, has also been beset by 
personal conflict as he has immersed himself in a subject that is the 
antithesis of all he believes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Events 
</P>
<P>
Emon, 36, says his children have been possessed by demons just before he 
conducted seminars on the occult. He says his wife has broken out in rashes as 
she approached the boxes of demonic memorabilia that he stores in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
And he says a pentagram, the five-pointed star often used as a symbol by 
satanists, once mysteriously appeared etched in his carpet, disappearing only 
after he dropped to his knees in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel this stuff getting to you sometimes," Emon said. "I have seen 
firsthand the power that's there. I suppose, if I didn't feel a real calling to 
learn more about this, there would be a lot less pressure in my life." 
</P>
<P>
These are statements that are sure to raise the eyebrows of skeptics. Warnings 
about supernatural forces and gruesome rituals often seem overly alarmist, if 
not flat-out fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But with the grisly drug-cult murders in Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this year 
and the self-styled satanism allegedly practiced by Night Stalker suspect 
Richard Ramirez, such notions have slowly begun to creep into the public 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occult-Related Crimes 
</P>
<P>
Some experts now say they hear of so many cases involving blood-drained 
animals, abused children and dismembered corpses that they believe occult 
rituals will be the crime of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you measure it against the tremendous gang and narcotic problems we have, 
it's still not a major issue," said Detective Patrick Metoyer, a 23-year 
veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a widely recognized expert in 
the field. "But it's something we had better be concerned with. Occult activity 
is definitely on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, as elsewhere in the state, documentation is still 
usually piecemeal and anecdotal. No police department has an officer assigned 
exclusively to such crimes. And authorities readily concede that they are not 
always equipped to decipher the clues left behind from ritualistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
That is where Emon steps in. 
</P>
<P>
When two decapitated chickens were discovered last month next to several small 
wax figurines, coconut pieces and shreds of colored cloth near a dry riverbed 
in South El Monte, it was Emon who determined that they were the remnants of a 
ritual from the Afro-Cuban religion, Santeria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Sacrifice 
</P>
<P>
No crime was committed because the animals appeared to have been slaughtered 
humanely, with a quick and clean cut, said Dan Sturkie, district supervisor for 
county Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
"But prior to this, it would have looked to us just like someone's leftover 
dinner," Sturkie said. "Now we're recognizing things more often for what they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The same was true for Covina police who last April arrested two youths, ages 16 
and 17, for allegedly mutilating at least seven cats, scrawling satanic symbols 
with the blood and leaving the tails in a box at the Covina Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the kids were able to convince the D.A. that it was all a joke," said 
Glenn Myers, the Covina crime prevention officer. "But it was still pretty 
scary behavior. Randy was able to look at some of the stuff and let us know 
that we had a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, an athletic, neatly groomed man who belongs to Cops for Christ, traces 
his connection with the occult back to 1985, shortly after Ramirez was captured 
and his obsession with satanic imagery revealed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident in Church 
</P>
<P>
That same week, Emon said he saw a demon possess a woman during a Sunday church 
service, watching as her face grew contorted and she repeated in a deep 
masculine voice, "No, I don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
From that moment on, he said, he felt "a nudge from up there" to learn 
everything there was to know about the occult. He soon realized it would be a 
road paved with tension. 
</P>
<P>
One night, just before he was going to conduct a seminar, his eldest son 
developed a high fever as he lay on his bed, arms extended to the ceiling, 
crying, "Get away, get away." 
</P>
<P>
Emon said he placed the boy in cool water and prayed for him until the fever 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, his younger son screamed from his bedroom that he could not 
see. Emon said he wrapped his arms around him and prayed until his son's vision 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Mere Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"I realized many of the events which had occurred . . . were not mere chance, 
but the work of Satan and his demons striving to discourage my research," he 
later wrote in a Christian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Emon's experiences, however, are not shared by all in his field. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that's pretty far out," said Investigator Sandi 
Gallant, the San Francisco Police Department's occult expert. "I've certainly 
never been haunted." 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer, the LAPD's expert, said he has been invited to attend satanic rituals 
but was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see a darn thing," he said. "I didn't hear diddly-squat. I didn't see 
any devil come down." 
</P>
<P>
A professor emeritus of religion at USC even compared Satan sleuths such as 
Emon to those who conducted the communist witch-hunts during the red-baiting 
days of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"You interpret what you find in the light of the glasses you look through," 
said Gerald Larue, who was named "Humanist of the Year" for 1989 by the 
American Humanist Assn. "You become obsessed with the enemy. And for a 
Christian, the enemy is Satan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiritual Encounters 
</P>
<P>
But an occult expert at the Christian Research Institute in Irvine said 
experiences such as Emon's were genuine spiritual encounters that were typical 
of devout Christians who trespass in the demonic realm. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, these things are nothing short of the bizarre," said Craig Hawkins, a 
research consultant at the institute. "But for a person who believes that there 
really is a spiritual realm, that kind of thing is not impossible at all. 
That's what happens when you enter the domain of the demonic." 
</P>
<P>
Some say Emon's deep faith even enhances his expertise. George Belanger, a 
former drummer for the occult-rock band Christian Death, said Emon was 
instrumental in helping him leave satanism behind. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Christians, when they find out you're from an occult background, they 
freak out," said Belanger, now a "born-again" Christian who lives in Glendora. 
"But Randy was very sympathetic, caring and loving. I had a lot of painful 
memories and he had a real soft ear." 
</P>
<P>
Emon, who is also director of the Christian Occult Investigators Network, a 
nonprofit research group in West Covina, says he works hard to keep his 
religious views from interfering with his police work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freedom of Worship 
</P>
<P>
He stresses First Amendment rights in all of his seminars, cautioning other 
officers that satanists -- unless their rituals break the law -- have the same 
freedom to worship as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
His supervisor, Baldwin Park Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin, said that there 
have been no conflicts, but he acknowledged that the subject can get touchy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sensitive issue," Hoskin said. "As far as being an embarrassment, it 
hasn't really come to that. But we have tried to suggest to him that he not 
become actively involved in that while he's on duty." 
</P>
<P>
On- or off-duty, however, it's hard for Emon to escape the occult. The 30 to 40 
boxes of artifacts from his investigations piled in the garage of his suburban 
home serve as constant reminders of his encounters with the demonic. 
</P>
<P>
He has photos of decapitated pigs, record albums from heavy metal bands, such 
as Venom and Slayer, literary staples such as Anton LaVey's "Satanic Bible" and 
comic books with ads for "100 Ready-to-Use Mystic Chants." 
</P>
<P>
He has a Ouija Board that he says sent mystical messages to a teen-ager to take 
his own life. He has a cardboard shrine splattered with blood. And he has a 
small squirrel tail that he says was cut from the animal in a satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy is a unique individual," said Tony Palmer, whose Walnut-based firm, 
International Law Enforcement Training &amp; Consulting, hires Emon to teach 
occult seminars to police officers. "He lives this stuff. In many different 
ways."

INTERPRETIVE CENTER IS TRIP THROUGH PENINSULA'S PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intimate Point Vicente Interpretive Center lets people teach themselves 
about Palos Verdes Peninsula's natural and cultural history as they make their 
way past photos, artifacts, maps and written material. 
</P>
<P>
But, as volunteer guide Sue Kersey puts it, "you get some of the fun things" 
you might otherwise miss, if you let a guide -- they're called docents -- take 
you through. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell people how the peacocks got here," she said, explaining that the 
pioneer Vanderlip family imported them when they owned most of the peninsula. 
Pausing before a large photo of Portuguese Bend shortly before a landslide 
began slowly wiping it out in 1956, docents point out which homes aren't there 
anymore. That's most of them. 
</P>
<P>
There is a scale model of the peninsula. Docents tell people that the canyon 
where bustling Peninsula Center is located was a lake millions of years ago. 
"Crenshaw (Boulevard) was the runoff, which is why it has such a deep ravine," 
Kersey said. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, the entire peninsula was once an island and Pasadena had a 
shoreline, according to a map that depicts the Los Angeles basin millions of 
years ago. "Our Pasadena visitors are always delighted to know that they once 
had oceanfront property," Kersey said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the docents are able to place themselves into peninsula history. When 
docent Bea Semos shows pictures of the 1961 wreck of the Greek freighter 
Dominator off Rocky Point, she recalls, "My son was in kindergarten and came 
running in and said, "Can we go see it, mom?' " 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes Recreation and Parks Director Mary Thomas calls the 
interpretive center "a jewel and crown of our park system." The city built the 
museum in 1984 on bluff parkland just north of the Point Vicente Lighthouse, 
which dates to 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Residents provided artifacts and memories that became part of the center's 
collection. It covers everything from animal life to American Indians to rancho 
days to whaling; it tells of the peninsula's growth from barren scrubland that 
no one wanted to a wealthy exurb of million-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 fiscal year, the interpretive center had a paid attendance 
of 26,336, though walking, picnicking or looking at native plants in the 
adjoining parkland is free. "It's wall-to-wall people on the weekends," Kersey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She heads the docent group, which numbers about 100 and sees to it that guides 
are always at the center. Docents like things to be "hands on" on their tours. 
Holding a small length of baleen -- which looks like a piece of plastic with 
fringe -- Kersey asked a couple of visitors what they thought it was. 
</P>
<P>
Is it bone, a visitor asked? No, Kersey explained, not bone, but a 
food-filtering system used by some whales that is made of the same stuff as 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are always asked to touch the large gray whale vertebra on display, 
and then touch their own spine.

HISTORIC GLASS FLASKS KEEP HIM LOOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Thomas Walker was about to repave one of the parking lots at South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa, he was probably hoping he might get lucky -- strike it 
rich by finding a rare glass bottle. 
</P>
<P>
In his case, that would mean uncovering a historical commemorative flask, but 
he knows that would be an improbable find, especially in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker, 34, is always on the lookout for pieces for the collection of 
colorful commemorative flasks he keeps in a lighted cabinet in his home in 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
And "every once in a while, I stumble across one in my travels," he said. "Most 
of them are probably hidden inside some New England houses or else buried in 
outhouse holes somewhere in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting these bottles is a serious hobby," says Walker, whose Long Beach 
company does most of the asphalt paving for campuses in the Irvine Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Serious Money 
</P>
<P>
It's one that involves some serious money, at any rate. Walker, who ranks 
himself among the top 25 collectors in the country, estimates that his 90-piece 
collection is worth about $100,000 and points out that a particularly rare 
flask can fetch as much as $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bottles were made between 1815 and 1880 and contained whiskey, wine or 
water. They were done for a variety of people, including presidential 
candidates such as Zachary Taylor, whose campaign handed them out for the 1848 
race. 
</P>
<P>
He began collecting pharmaceutical bottles as a lad, but he didn't start the 
flask collection until 12 years ago. "I really got involved in it after I 
bought my first one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone has seen his collection, though, or even knows that he has it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's risky taking them anywhere," Walker said. In fact, it is rare for him to 
show his collection, although he will take a few pieces to the shows sponsored 
by the Federation of Historical Bottle Collectors. (The federation has a show 
each year at the Anaheim Convention Center.) 
</P>
<P>
The few books with information for bottle researchers say that there are about 
20,000 commemorative flasks in circulation. Most are in private collections, 
although some museums do have flasks that they exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seldom Available to Buy 
</P>
<P>
"About the only time you find them for sale is when a collector dies," Walker 
said, noting that the last major sale was an auction of a 999-piece collection 
in 1983 in Connecticut. It drew 300 collectors; Walker bought one bottle. 
</P>
<P>
His prized commemorative bottle is a yellow and green one called an "Eagle 
Sunburst." Walker said there are 10 in existence but his is the only one in 
those colors. 
</P>
<P>
"Color has to do with everything," he said. "An aqua bottle can bring $600, but 
one in cobalt blue can bring $45,000." Walker declined to place a value on his 
"Eagle Sunburst." 
</P>
<P>
The rainbows of colors on the old flasks will never be re-created, he said. 
"Early glassmaking is a lost art, and nobody can reproduce it these days," he 
said. "They just can't hit the mark."

'CONNECTIONS' OPENS WINDOWS INTO THE DEPTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev is a big fan of Soviet playwright Alexander Gelman. So is 
Kristoffer Tabori. "He looks at people with enormous compassion, enormous 
scrutiny -- and the knife of a surgeon," said the director of Gelman's "A Man 
With Connections," opening tonight at West Hollywood's Matrix Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"The story is about the relationship between a man and woman who've been 
intimate, had a family and made love with each other for 20 years," Tabori 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
As the play opens, the couple (played by Charles Hallahan and Carolyn Seymour) 
are dealing with a horrible industrial accident involving their son; resentment 
and recriminations suddenly engulf their marriage. Tabori, 37, believes the 
characters' pain reaches beyond the concerns of ordinary kitchen-sink drama. 
</P>
<P>
"The play is highly domestic in its structure, yet -- while expecting 
individuals to take responsibility for their own lives -- it reverberates with 
our recognition that a society is responsible for the kind of people it 
produces. That's always a lesson of great drama: Shakespeare, Arthur Miller. 
'Death of a Salesman' is a psychological investigation of Willy Loman and his 
family -- but never forget that a man like Willy compromises himself because of 
the culture he lives in." 
</P>
<P>
To research visual details of a contemporary Soviet home, the director and his 
set designers saw the Russian film "Little Vera" -- thoroughly expecting stiff 
characters interacting unemotionally in a gray-hued setting. "I saw passionate, 
wild, interesting, volcanic people," Tabori marveled. "Immediately I thought of 
the characters in this play, the fights they have. This play is only interested 
in the raw experience. What's so wonderful is, it does it in a rather 
delightfully middle-European way." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Gelman, who's in his mid-50s, is a concentration camp survivor who 
lost his entire family in the war. Married to a screenwriter, he spent many 
years as an engineer, writing his first play at age 38. "Man With Connections," 
with a translation by Stephen Mulrine, will be his first play done in the 
United States. "I think we're dealing with a master," Tabori said cautiously. 
"I can't be sure. We're in a town that tends to worship a new guru every week. 
It used to be that everybody'd be famous for 15 minutes. Now everybody's a 
genius for 15 minutes." He grinned. 
</P>
<P>
Exhaustion aside, at the Matrix, where he starred in "The Common Pursuit" in 
'86 and directed "Inadmissible Evidence" in '85, Tabori is loving the 
experience of being part of the new repertory season established by company 
producer Joe Stern. ("Connections" will play in repertory with Larry Shue's 
"Wenceslas Square.") "I think it was born out of a need in all of us to create 
community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Tabori directs, he uses the name Siegel as a hyphenate to honor his 
father, director Don Siegel. His mother is actress Viveca Lindfors, his 
stepfather -- the man who raised him -- Hungarian playwright George Tabori. 
</P>
<P>
"In this country, we're too naked all by ourselves. The most successful actors 
right now are ones who've come out of and have a home they can return to: Kevin 
Kline from John Houseman's company, William Hurt from Juilliard." 
</P>
<P>
Tabori, who was born in Los Angeles and raised in New York, shook his head. "I 
never had that when I started. I didn't do well in school. I'm a high school 
dropout." (He left at age 16, and immediately started working at Lincoln Center 
and Circle Rep.) "I never liked the idea of being in a company. I think I 
envisioned being an artist as an experience in which you were kind of separate. 
Your identity was created by your work, and your work was created by your 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was wrong. Our profession is about community. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear some directors talk about how they love working with different 
actors. Well, I like to work with the same people. It's a bit like the 
difference between an affair and a marriage. An affair is heady, exciting, 
novel, filled with fresh scents and new behavior patterns. But a marriage -- if 
you get to really know somebody -- is about getting deep. Not so many highs, 
not so many lows. But getting deeper into experience." 
</P>
<P>
Artistically, Tabori hopes to now tap into that at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for me to find a home is so powerful," he said earnestly. "It's what 
I've been looking for. When I was 16 I wanted to have sex all the time. Then I 
wanted to take drugs and travel and then I wanted to stay up late. Then real 
late: 'Hey, I won't even go to bed!' Then it was more coffee. . . . Then it 
gets to be about something else. My journey now -- at least in my work; my 
personal life is mishigas -- is to get down. Get serious. Get down."

WATCHING WATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People in the media are in the business of selling illusion; but, increasingly, 
they are beginning to believe the illusions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case when Daniel Cerone asked television critics "What America 
Watches -- and Why" (Aug. 6). To believe that TV critics are authorities on 
what motivates viewers to watch one program over another is to put up mirrors 
and smoke screens. What is more interesting is how such critics themselves 
influence what America watches. Indeed, TV critics create self-fulfilling 
prophecies by telling the public what they are going to like or dislike and 
why.

MORE DAUGHTERS FOR 'EVERYDAD'; 
</P>
<P>
ACTOR WHO PUT FAMILY OVER HIS CAREER STARS IN 'ASPIRIN AND ELEPHANTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
His face and voice are as familiar as they come -- the byproduct of more than 
30 plays, 80 films and 600 television appearances. On TV, especially, he's been 
Everydad: on "The Patty Duke Show," "The Nancy Drew Mysteries," "Gidget" and 
"The New Gidget." Now, William Schallert is playing another father of daughters 
in Jerry Mayer's new comedy, "Aspirin and Elephants," at the Santa Monica 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Set on a cruise ship bound for Leningrad, the story finds Schallert's character 
newly recovered from a heart attack, celebrating his 50th wedding anniversary 
on a family vacation that includes his two grown daughters and their 
respective, problematic spouses. Mayer -- whose first play, "Almost Perfect," 
recounted a troubled time early in his marriage -- is again skating on 
autobiographical ice, drawing heavily on a vacation that actually took place 
several years ago with his wife, Emily, and her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, my character, Junior, is based on this real-life guy, Buddy, 
who was a clothing manufacturer in St. Louis," explained Schallert, 67. "And 
although Junior and Buddy share a lot of the same qualities -- and there's a 
certain area of interface where they're alike, I'm not playing Buddy. I'm 
playing a guy named Junior, who's a character in a play. So it's not real-life 
anymore. Neil Simon does the same thing; any good writer does. Otherwise, what 
do you draw on?" 
</P>
<P>
Though he has toiled in the theater for more than 40 years (his last local 
stage outing was in the original cast of "Tamara"), this is the first time 
Schallert has worked directly with an author on a world premiere. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first day of rehearsals, Jerry was there. And he's still there, 
monitoring and tinkering with the play, doing a little refurbishing -- 
sometimes more than he should, then pulling back. It's a real testing ground. 
Jerry comes out of television, where that's the M.O. A writer spends his time 
reworking scripts in the rehearsal process. So sometimes we'd make suggestions: 
'It'd be helpful if I could have something here . . . ' He'd say, 'Let me see 
what I can come up with' -- and the next day, he'd have it." 
</P>
<P>
As the son of Edwin Schallert, who was drama editor at The Times from 1919 to 
1958, and Elza Baumgarten, a free-lance journalist and radio host, he was 
well-schooled in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very interested in being a composer," Schallert said, referring to 
college studies with composer Arnold Schoenberg. "Or a singer. I played the 
piano too. But I couldn't do any of them fast enough to make a living. I was 
just a good amateur talent. I was also working on the school paper at UCLA -- 
and I was a campus stringer for the Herald-Examiner." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't where his heart was. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like writing that much -- it was like pulling teeth for me," 
Schallert admitted. A friend asked him to try out for a part in a student 
production of "Volpone," and he got the part. That led to a call from a talent 
scout at 20th Century Fox, and after a stint in the service, he threw himself 
into acting. Graduating from UCLA in 1946, Schallert joined the local Circle 
Theatre;in 1949 he married fellow company member Lia Waggner. They have four 
grown sons, none of them actors. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has maintained a very healthy career over the years, Schallert 
swears that a movie star's salary was the furthest thing from his mind when he 
chose acting. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides talent, I think the most important quality an actor has is need. I 
don't know if I can define what that need is -- but performing satisfies it. I 
tried directing;I don't like it. The director's need is to be the boss, and I'm 
not wild about being the boss. I often wonder how I let myself be seduced into 
running for president of the Screen Actors Guild if I didn't want to be a 
director," he chuckled, recalling his 1979-81 tenure. He is planning to run for 
treasurer in November. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of his recent jobs have been in voice-overs, Schallert is still 
frequently recognized on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been crushed by mobs of screaming fans," he protests. "But yeah, 
more people recognize me today than 10 or 15 years ago. What's happened is that 
the kids who watched me on 'The Patty Duke Show' are in their 30s now. They 
honk their horns at me on the street, lean out the windows and say, 'I grew up 
with you!' Well, that's sweet. And now they're running the show on 'Nick at 
Nite,' so there's a whole new generation of kids seeing them." 
</P>
<P>
Though he has usually been cast as likeable types, a few years ago Schallert 
was offered a role as Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in a stage project being 
developed at the Odyssey. "After I did a little reading, I called them and 
said, 'I can't do this. I don't want to find a justification for the Holocaust 
inside myself. I don't want to go poking around till I find something that 
makes it possible for me to play a guy who could participate in that. If it's 
in me, I'd rather not now t.' I just found it too painful an issue for me to 
deal with; I didn't want to put myself through that." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. "Maybe when I was younger, I would've done it because it was 
such a great part. Well, there are other things in life besides great parts. 
Along the way, I've had to make choices." 
</P>
<P>
One came in 1971, when a stage role in "The Trial of the Catonsville Nine" took 
him from the Taper to Off Broadway (where he won an Obie) on the way to 
Broadway. "It might have been wise for me to stay with the play, but I was 
missing the family so much. I'd been away five months, and I finally said, 
'Enough already. I've got to leave.' " 
</P>

"I've been fortunate to make my living mostly in the voice-over field," 
Schallert said. (He can currently be heard in ads for Van de Kamp's frozen fish 
and Mrs. Smith's Pies. "I haven't had to travel all over the world, as many 
actors do, on location with one movie role after another. And frankly, I'm 
grateful for that. In the long run, I decided that acting was how I made my 
living -- and making a living had to do with providing support for the family, 
making sure the boys got started well in life. There are more important things 
than being a movie star. The most important, I think, is family."

FREEWAY CALL BOXES: HELP IN A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's year-old system of freeway telephones has a problem -- the 
dispatchers at California Highway Patrol headquarters in Santa Ana can't 
understand many of the callers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,134 call boxes spaced every quarter of a mile along all the county's 
freeways were used a record 13,500 times last month. About 10% of the callers, 
as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish or 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatchers, however, speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
"From the start, the number of people calling in foreign languages has 
surprised us," said Todd Murphy, chairman of California SAFE (Service Authority 
for Freeway Emergencies), which handles wireless call boxes in California. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that when the call box service was launched last September, 
officials expected to receive some calls in Spanish but never anticipated the 
volume and diversity of foreign language calls. 
</P>
<P>
An interpreter center was retained to deal with non-English-speaking callers. 
When foreign language calls come into Santa Ana, the caller is patched into the 
interpretation facility -- Communications and Language Line, based in Monterey, 
Calif. -- and a three-way conversation takes place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flood of Calls 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say they receive more demands for interpretation from Orange 
County than anywhere else freeway phones are used. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very start we found that Orange County runs 30 to 40 different 
languages every month, about the same as in New York City," said Mike McFerrin, 
information manager for Communications and Language Line, which can interpret 
in 143 languages. "We get more calls from call boxes in Orange County than we 
do from anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Although the center has had to deal with Orange County callers who speak only 
such languages as Romanian and Farsi, about half the foreign language calls are 
in Spanish. Although they can hook up by telephone with the interpretation 
service, Highway Patrol officials say they need Spanish speakers on staff to 
handle the heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
"The translation service is great, but it's costly and slower than having 
somebody on hand," said Lt. Rick Criner, manager of the Santa Ana 
communications center. "We need somebody on staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better to have bilingual people on hand rather than to try and sort 
things out over three telephone lines. They are faster and they can save lives 
if they know CHP policies and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Criner said the telephone center has had difficulty attracting Spanish-speaking 
applicants and that CHP regulations have hampered the hiring of Spanish 
speakers. Under department rules, bilingual dispatchers can be paid more after 
they are hired but can be given preference in hiring only if they are among the 
top three candidates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the CHP allocated extra money to be paid to two Spanish-speaking 
dispatchers in the Santa Ana office, but so far none has been hired. In June, 
the department held its first bilingual test for dispatchers. Of 20 applicants, 
four qualified and have been listed for hire, said CHP spokesman Keith 
Thornhill. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County began to install the call box system in 1987 after the area's 26 
municipalities approved a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle registrations to pay 
for it.

APPLICATIONS HIT RECORD HIGHS FOR U.S. LAW SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
INCREASE ATTRIBUTED TO IMPACT OF TELEVISION HIT 'L.A. LAW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in more than 15 years, law school applications in the United 
States are breaking records. 
</P>
<P>
At the California Western School of Law in San Diego the expectation of a 
record number of first-year students has led Dean Michael H. Dessent to take 
the unusual step of assigning himself to teach a class. 
</P>
<P>
"The dean's going to have to put on the raincoat and boots, watch out for the 
tomatoes and get back in there," Dessent said. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented interest in law school -- reflected in record applications at 
the University of San Diego, UCLA, USC and elsewhere -- is attributable in 
large part to a single law firm, admissions officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
That would be the firm of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney &amp; Kuzak. They practice 
on the weekly television series, "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to say (the increase is due to) 'L.A. Law'," said Nancy C. 
Ramsayer, director of admissions at Cal Western. "I keep wanting to discount 
that, saying it may have just something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Oh My God, Maybe It Is That' 
</P>
<P>
" . . . However, the other day I had someone telling me they were doing a 
research project, and they had to do so much research, and it wasn't like 'L.A. 
Law' at all. And I thought, oh my God, maybe it is that." 
</P>
<P>
In line last week at the financial aid office at Cal Western, incoming student 
David Guglielmi, 22, of Washington, D.C., said that indeed "L.A. Law" did play 
a part in his decision to apply to law school. 
</P>
<P>
The show portrays "younger people having a good time, making a lot of money, 
the fine clothes," he said. That image is what "people are buying into. That's 
what I bought into." 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Taber, 23, of Eugene, Ore., another incoming student, said that she has 
never watched the show, but she's convinced it still affected her application. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to go to law school before the show but the competition was a lot 
tougher because of the show," she said. "I think it's directly related to the 
TV show, the glamour on TV." 
</P>
<P>
While Cal Western, an independent law school accredited by the American Bar 
Assn., has been able to expand its class size from 240 to about 300 to 
accommodate increases in applications, most top schools don't have that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6,533 Applied for 320 Spaces 
</P>
<P>
UCLA received 6,533 applicants -- "clearly a record" -- for the 320 spaces in 
this fall's class, Michael Rappaport, dean of admissions at UCLA, said. That 
was a 16.5% increase over the 5,607 applicants for the 1988-89 entering class, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that's interesting about the statistics is not only is the number of 
applicants way up but the quality of applicants also is up," Rappaport said. 
"What we find is that we are turning down people who would have been admitted 
several years ago, even last year." 
</P>
<P>
Tuition at UCLA is $832.25 per semester, Rappaport said. But even a tuition of 
$15,316, which is what the coming year will cost at USC, did not deter 
applicants. USC received a record 3,450 applicants for this year's class of 
about 190, said Robert M. Saltzman, dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
At USD, officials received a record 3,570 applications for 320 spaces, said 
Young, the assistant dean. Just two years ago, the school received 2,450. 
That's a 46% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Young ordered 40,000 brochures last fall, figuring they would last two years. 
Instead, the school sent out 28,000 last year alone and needs to reorder, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford received a record 5,255 applicants for a class of 170, or 31 
applications for each opening, said Dora Hjertberg, director of admissions. In 
San Francisco, the University of California's Hastings College of the Law got 
5,126 applications, a new high, up 18% from 4,330 the year before, said Thomas 
Wadlington, admissions director. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard got about 7,800 applications for 540 spots, said Joyce Curll, assistant 
dean for admissions. Yale got 4,682 for 175, said Loretta Tremblay, assistant 
director of admissions. Both figures were records. 
</P>
<P>
This year's cascade of applications is particularly intriguing, UCLA's 
Rappaport said, because it came "in the face of predictions three or four years 
ago, when law school applications were down, that law school applications would 
level off or maybe just keep going down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bottomed in 1985-86 
</P>
<P>
Interest in law school, which had reached a previous peak in 1973-74, bottomed 
out in 1985-86, said William J. Kennish, vice president of operations for Law 
School Admission Services in Newtown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
LSAS runs the Law School Admission Test, which along with an applicant's 
college grade point average is used by most schools to rank candidates. In 
1973-74, LSAS administered about 135,400 tests, Kennish said. In 1985-86, the 
end of 12 years of decline, the number administered was down to about 91,400, 
Kennish said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988-89 testing year, the one during which most people who applied for 
this fall's entering class took the exam, LSAS administered 136,367 tests, 
Kennish said. "So we have in fact made up more than 12 years of decline in 
three years of increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone asks if it's 'L.A. Law' and so forth," Kennish said. " . . . What's 
happened, I think, is that two factors have changed dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The first, he said, is economic. 
</P>
<P>
"If the perception is that the economy is unsound," Kennish said, instead of 
going to law school, college graduates figure, 'Jeez, I've got to get into the 
marketplace.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Sacrifice 
</P>
<P>
But when inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, remains low, as it 
was in early 1970s and then has been again since the mid-1980s, more people are 
willing to make the financial sacrifice law school requires, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A person applying to law school is making a commitment to about $20,000 a year 
now for three years," Kennish said. "That's a $60,000 out-of-pocket expense, 
plus they're out of the marketplace, which probably means another $60,000. 
That's fairly quickly over $100,000 in lost money by a person deciding to go to 
law school." 
</P>
<P>
The second factor, Kennish said, is the "perception of opportunities for 
lawyers, which I believe are not driven by 'L.A. Law,' but rather reflected by 
'L.A. Law,' that there are in fact great opportunities for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
" 'L.A. Law' gives the perception that people come out of law school and take 
$85,000-a-year jobs. So when you combine an improved perception of opportunity 
with an improved economic environment, I believe you have a very improved 
climate for an increase in law school applications." 
</P>
<P>
Since NBC aired the first edition of "L.A. Law" on Sept. 15, 1986. Charles B. 
Rosenberg, the Los Angeles lawyer who is legal adviser to the show, said he has 
"heard many people say that the show is the cause or a major cause of the 
increase in law school applications." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Glamorous and Interesting' 
</P>
<P>
Though he said he doubts it is the primary cause, "I guess the best I can say 
is that it certainly is possible that it contributes to that trend because it 
does tend to paint the profession as glamorous and interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Other admissions officials point to other television dramas as reasons behind 
the increase -- as well as additional factors. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a heightened awareness of the profession due to things like the 
Bork hearings, the Irangate hearings," said Wadlington, admissions director at 
Hastings in San Francisco, referring to congressional hearings probing the 
nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court of Robert Bork and the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, every time I turn around there's something legal on the tube," 
Wadlington said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I think that also other professions have slid as far as attractiveness. 
I think Black Monday (the October 1987 Wall Street crash) burned off your 
traditional M.B.A. candidate and so people steered away from business. Medical 
schools have been down for several years, though they are bouncing back, and 
with talk of national health insurance it no longer is the golden profession it 
once was in terms of earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is a beneficial trend that more students are interested in the law 
is another matter for debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Profession' 
</P>
<P>
Colin W. Wied, a San Diego attorney who is the current president of the State 
Bar of California, where there are more than 117,000 active attorneys, believes 
the interest in law schools reveals "a lot of people view (law) as a good 
profession to be in." 
</P>
<P>
"Just as an observation, (the wave of applications) seems to me to belie the 
notion that law is a discredited profession," Wied said. "Just for starters. 
These are non-lawyers out there who, notwithstanding all the negative things 
that have been said recently about law and lawyers, want to be lawyers. I find 
that encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
But the trend may have a distinct downside, said Rappaport, dean of admissions 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear we are seeing a growing, disproportionate number of technical 
backgrounds (among applicants)," Rappaport said. "Computer sciences, 
engineering majors, biology, chemistry, people out working in these fields, 
people with Ph.Ds. from MIT and Caltech applying to law school." 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport emphasized that his observations were not yet statistically bolstered 
and he had just a "hunch." But "it's what I'm seeing. And if what I'm seeing is 
true, it's something we all ought to be concerned about. It suggests a real 
brain drain into the legal profession from the sciences and other technical 
areas, which frankly are more important to the 21st Century than lawyers. And, 
yes, you can quote me."

OUTFALL FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to respond to your piece, "Scripps Sewage Tack Differs in Own Back 
Yard," (Aug. 11.) 
</P>
<P>
Reputable scientists have never stated that there is no influence of outfalls 
on the local flora and fauna. Most natural communities are very sensitive to 
increases or decreases in food production and the organic loading in sewage 
effluent represents a huge increase in food to the surrounding area with 
well-described local changes. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, is this important? In the context of the overall state of the 
ocean, the answer is no. In the context of recreational and commercial use of 
the coastal ocean near shore, the answer is again, no, if outfalls have been 
properly sited offshore at depth as the one at Point Loma is. In the context of 
trying to maintain an underwater reserve, the answer may well be, yes, which is 
why Scripps questioned the location of an outfall north of the underwater 
reserve, and north of Scripps pier where the intake for seawater used for 
research and aquarium purposes is withdrawn. Given a knowledge of the local 
coastal ocean, there could be times when because of circulation features some 
portion of the waste stream could impinge on either the water supply or on the 
underwater reserve, and could cause changes. 
</P>
<P>
The underwater reserve was set aside in an effort to protect an indigenous 
biota, one that has been under assault from recreational and commercial fishing 
and diving. Additionally, the Scripps pier has served as an important location 
for monitoring physical, biological and chemical properties of the ocean over 
the past several decades, and any kind of potential artificial change to the 
signal should be avoided. These conservation and research issues are different 
from questions about impacts of the outfall on recreational or commercial 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Having Scripps speak out against a northern outfall is not contradictory to the 
idea of maintaining an underwater "wilderness" area. And having Scripps 
scientists speak out as citizens against secondary treatment as expensive and 
not worth the effort does speak not to the goal of maintaining an underwater 
reserve but is answering a question about the impacts of coastal outfalls on 
the general health of the coastal ocean.

As an ardently pro-life Republican, I feel disenfranchised by the results of 
the election in the 76th Assembly District on Aug. 8 and angered by the news 
coverage of the election ("Pro-Choice Forces Take Credit for Victory in 76th," 
Aug. 10). I voted for candidate Dennis Koolhaas because he was an excellent, 
experienced candidate and pro-life. 
</P>
<P>
He and the other pro-life Republicans captured 57.8% of the vote, yet the news 
media continue to report the victory of Tricia Hunter as a pro-choice victory. 
True, two pro-choice candidates won, but if this election is to be treated as a 
referendum on the abortion issue, why do the Los Angeles Times and other news 
media ignore their own statistics, which show 57.8% for pro-life candidates to 
40.3% for pro-choice candidates? 
</P>
<P>
The peculiar nature of the race, which allowed crossover voting, further 
muddies the issue. Republicans in the district are left to choose between two 
pro-choice candidates, both largely selected by Democratic voters. Democrats 
urged Democrats to vote for Tricia Hunter. Thus the large majority of 
Republicans who voted for pro-life candidates are effectively left with no 
choice in the October election. But at least report the significance of the 
statistics correctly.

GIRL, 6, KILLED AS CAR FLIPS ON ROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old San Diego girl was killed Saturday morning when the car she was 
riding in flipped over on a Mission Valley freeway ramp after being sideswiped. 
</P>
<P>
Elise Arent was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Injured in the 11:30 a.m. traffic accident were her father, Terry Arent, 32, 
who was listed in serious condition at Mercy Hospital, and her mother, Shelly 
Arent, 32, who was treated for minor injuries at the UC San Diego Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
They were not wearing seat belts, officials said. But another child in the car, 
identified as 1-year-old Ashley Arent, was strapped into an infant seat and 
escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Gill, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman, said the accident occurred 
when another vehicle illegally passed the Arent car on the ramp leading from 
southbound California 163 to westbound Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
She said the passing car struck the Arent vehicle, which then overturned. The 
driver of the other car, Gary R. Hoag, 26, of San Diego was being questioned, 
the CHP said.

TANKER OVERTURNS; TRAFFIC JAMS TIE UP SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic was gridlocked for much of the day Saturday over a wide area of the 
Santa Clarita Valley after a tanker truck carrying 8,000 gallons of pressurized 
gasoline overturned on an on-ramp to the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A three-mile stretch of the freeway and sections of Sierra Highway and San 
Fernando Road were closed for hours Saturday afternoon and evening after 
officials, attempting to pump fuel from the downed tanker, discovered that it 
was leaking. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was unhurt, and no injuries were reported. But the Antelope 
Valley and Golden State freeways were backed up for miles and traffic was at a 
virtual standstill on numerous surface streets as vehicles detoured from the 
Antelope Valley Freeway after the early afternoon closures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be the first time that a whole city of 140,000 people has been 
closed down by a SigAlert," said Carl Boyer, a Santa Clarita city councilman, 
who said traffic was stopped on streets near his home five miles from the 
accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, thank goodness it's Saturday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The wreck finally was cleared and the roads reopened about 8:45 p.m., according 
to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
After the leaking fuel was discovered and strong gas fumes filled the air, 
officials drew up a standby evacuation plan for a 1/4-mile area around the 
wreck but did not implement it. Although the area is sparsely populated, 
officials estimated that about 1,500 people live or work at businesses within 
the evacuation zone. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker overturned just after 7 a.m. on the San Fernando Road on-ramp to the 
southbound Antelope Valley Freeway. Emergency crews erected a dike around the 
tanker, but the leakage was not detected until about 1 p.m. as fuel was being 
pumped to a second truck. 
</P>
<P>
Vacuum trucks were called in to suck fuel from the pavement and to unload 
remaining fuel from the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
After 7 p.m., when as much gas had been removed from the tanker as could be 
suctioned out, crews began using giant air bags and tow trucks to right the 
tanker, while laying down fire-retardant foam. 
</P>
<P>
The accident mobilized the state Department of Transportation, the CHP, the 
county Department of Health Services and sheriff's officers, along with 
hazardous-materials specialists, fire engines, a foam truck and about 70 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
An official with Hurt's Transportation, owner of the truck, blamed the accident 
on driver error. Bud Kenneally, a vice president of the firm, said the driver, 
Allen LeCain, 23, of Bakersfield, turned too wide on the on-ramp and struck the 
curb with the left front of the truck, which overturned when he turned back too 
sharply to the right.

FAMILY TORN AFTER DAUGHTER GIVES CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Loretta Andrew says she has always been a peacemaker, not a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
But for the past four months, Andrew and her husband William have been 
embroiled in an unusual and bitter adoption dispute that pits the Shadow Hills 
couple against their 18-year-old daughter, Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
The case centers on Cindy Andrew's 1 1/2-year-old child, Griffin Michael 
Andrew. After she gave the boy up for adoption in April, her parents joined 
forces with the child's father, Michael Joseph Turner, in an attempt to get 
legal custody of him. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 20, and Cindy Andrew never married. Cindy was able to give the boy up 
for adoption without Turner's approval because Turner never sought to establish 
legally that he is the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
The battle began when Cindy Andrew took Griffin from her parents' house, where 
they had been living, and asked an adoption agency to place her son with a new 
family. Cindy's parents said she did not tell them or Turner of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, they said, Andrew moved in with her new boyfriend, who owns a 
video store and lives with his parents in Shadow Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Andrew, 40, said she was hysterical when she learned that her daughter 
had put the child up for adoption. "All she would tell us was, 'You'll get over 
it.' I thought, 'Oh boy, is she mistaken.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Andrews are backing Turner in a paternity suit he filed to establish that 
he is Griffin's father. The purpose of the lawsuit, in which the Andrews have 
agreed to testify on Turner's behalf, is to enable Turner to legally adopt 
Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Andrew and the adoptive parents, meanwhile, have petitioned in court to 
deny Turner's parental rights. The lawsuits, pending in Glendale Municipal 
Court, will determine whether the adoptive parents will be able to retain 
custody of the child. The next hearing in the matter is Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cindy Andrew and the adoptive parents, whose identity has been kept 
secret, declined through their attorneys to comment. The attorneys would not 
answer questions about the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services has not approved 
Griffin's adoption by the couple. A waiting period during which the agency 
investigates proposed adoptive parents is routine, and the lawsuits have 
stalled the process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Love Her' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it got to this point," William Andrew, a brakeman for Union 
Pacific Railroad, said about the legal battle over his grandson. "Cindy is our 
daughter and we love her . . . but under the circumstances, we can't just act 
like nothing has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Andrew, a secretary for a construction company, said she is afraid that 
her daughter does not understand the consequences of her decision. "I don't 
think she realizes how much she will miss her son down the road. Now she might 
say, 'Gosh, my Mom and Dad love Griffin more than me.' But it's because of her 
that we love him, and she can't see that." 
</P>
<P>
Both Turner and the Andrews said they are still unsure about Cindy's motive for 
giving her child up for adoption. "It just happened out of the dark," Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said Cindy Andrew had asked him months before she took the child if he 
would sign papers giving up his legal rights to Griffin, but he refused. "I was 
leaning toward the idea of letting her parents adopt the baby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Cindy Andrew asked her parents when Griffin was 4 months old if they 
would take full responsibility for the child and they agreed, Loretta Andrew 
said. She said she talked with her daughter about making the arrangement legal, 
but Cindy said that would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was His Mother' 
</P>
<P>
"From the time the baby was 4 months old to the time he was 15 months old, I 
had full control," Loretta Andrew said. "I fed him. I bathed him. I took him to 
the doctor. . . . I was his mother." 
</P>
<P>
William Andrew said his daughter might have been unhappy that her mother took 
over responsibility of raising her son. "Everybody was happy with the situation 
the way it was," he said. "The only person . . . unhappy was Cindy. I think she 
felt guilty. She would come home and see her mom taking care of Griffin. She 
didn't want the responsibility, and she thought this was a way out, by giving 
Griffin up for adoption." 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Andrew said that when her daughter became pregnant, she and Cindy 
discussed adoption but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said the subject was brought up again about four months after the 
baby was born. "I said, 'Cindy, it's too late. You made your decision,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Andrews said their daughter began talking about adoption about the same 
time that she began seeing her new boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing Trip 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before she took Griffin, Cindy Andrew asked her mother if she and her 
boyfriend could take the boy on a fishing trip. Loretta Andrew said that when 
the day of the trip arrived, she dressed the toddler and helped them get ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last time she saw her grandson, Andrew said. When she returned 
from a shopping trip that day, Andrew found a note her daughter had left 
telling her about the adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just stunned," Andrew said. "We called a child-abuse hot line, the 
police, everybody we could think of." 
</P>
<P>
She and Turner went to an attorney. "We've gotten closer through all this 
because we have a common goal: to get Griffin back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although Turner never provided financial support for the boy, he 
has visited him regularly and has established a close bond with the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Griffin knew who his Dad was," Andrew said. "You can't deny a father his 
rights because he didn't pay any money. He wasn't asked to pay. I never asked 
the mother to pay anything as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Bought House 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who installs security alarm systems, said he recently purchased a house 
in North Hollywood and feels confident that he can take care of his son. 
"Financially, I can afford it," Turner said. "I can't see how anybody in their 
right mind could take a child away from a family that loves him and can take 
care of him." 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Andrew said she hoped that she would be able to share custody of 
Griffin with Turner, an arrangement Turner said he would accept. If Turner is 
not granted custody, Andrew said, she would file her own adoption petition. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Andrews and Turner said the hardest part is not knowing 
where Griffin is and not being able to visit him. Loretta Andrew said she hopes 
that her daughter will realize soon that Griffin belongs with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is to get Griffin back and that someday -- it won't be soon -- Cindy 
will say, 'Thank you' for fighting for him," Loretta Andrew said. "That is my 
hope. But in reality, I don't know."

VENTILATOR PATIENTS ASSAIL MEDI-CAL; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS COMPLAIN POLICIES FORCE HOSPITALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN and LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writers

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of Southern California hospital patients, dependent for breathing on 
mechanical ventilators but nonetheless capable of living at home with proper 
nursing, are trapped in institutions because of inefficient and unfair state 
Medi-Cal policies, patient advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Advocacy Group for Ventilator Dependent People, 
82 patients -- who could be living more happily elsewhere if resources were 
available -- were confined in Los Angeles and Orange county hospitals in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was highlighted last month when Northridge Hospital Medical Center 
went to court to evict Shervin Firouzi, a ventilator-dependent patient who had 
lived at the hospital for nearly two years and had run up hospital expenses 
exceeding $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, these people are in prison tighter than Sirhan Sirhan," said 
William S. Prentice, a registered nurse who works with ventilator patients at 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey. "He gets to face a parole board 
every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Among those trapped is Sarah, a 7-year-old polio victim. She has lived in 
hospitals since she was 2 months old, breathing with a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abandoned by Parents 
</P>
<P>
Abandoned by her parents soon after she became ill, she could have left Rancho 
Los Amigos and gone to live with an Antelope Valley foster family six months 
ago. But the foster family has not been able to find a state-approved home 
health agency willing to provide her with nursing care at the low rates paid by 
the state Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants a family," said Dr. Irene Gilgoff, a pediatrician who heads the 
advocacy group. Gilgoff said Sarah has been her saddest case. 
</P>
<P>
State Medi-Cal officials argue that, in some cases, the cost of providing the 
in-home nursing care needed by ventilator-dependent people far exceeds the 
expense of caring for patients in nursing homes or in so-called subacute 
hospital nursing units. 
</P>
<P>
They also contend that although most ventilator-dependent patients require 
around-the-clock nursing care, not all are sick enough to qualify for the more 
intensive nursing that an acute-care program would provide. In most cases, a 
patient must be classified as needing acute medical services before the state's 
Medi-Cal program will pay for at-home nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a ventilator-dependent person is deemed eligible for at-home nursing, 
advocates and attorneys say, the rate the state pays for nurses is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The state pays $18.75 an hour for licensed vocational nursing in Southern 
California. Private insurers pay between $27 and $35 an hour for the same 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Medi-Cal program has raised its rates several times, partly in 
response to lawsuits claiming that the low rates were causing patients to be 
denied services they were otherwise eligible to receive, the rates are still 
widely considered to be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, however, contend that nursing shortages are widespread and 
would affect patients no matter how high the state sets its rates. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of patients just stay in the hospital a long time until they can find an 
agency that will accept them," said a supervisor at a Santa Ana home nursing 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrendous Amounts of Care' 
</P>
<P>
She said her company, Personal Care Home Health Agency, accepts a limited 
number of new Medi-Cal patients. But many others do not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the bottom line is these people require horrendous amounts of care, 
but they really don't have to be in the hospital, and it could be done much 
less expensively in outside facilities," said Dr. Kenneth Cohen, who works with 
spinal cord-injury patients at Rancho Los Amigos. "It could save everybody a 
lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal officials dispute that the state could save money by paying for 
nursing care at home for these patients. 
</P>
<P>
They also deny that large numbers of ventilator patients are stuck in hospitals 
against their wishes. Darryl Nixon, administrator of Medi-Cal's field office in 
Los Angeles, said only one person in the county is awaiting a hospital 
discharge to go home. He said four others are seeking approval to receive 
nursing care at home. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said he did not know how many patients had applied for but had been 
denied eligibility for in-home nursing care paid by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
That was the situation faced by Firouzi, a 24-year-old quadriplegic whose spine 
was injured in a 1987 diving accident. Although his brain was not injured, 
Firouzi depends on a mechanical ventilator to breathe and needs 
around-the-clock nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
He gets around in a wheelchair controlled by a chin device and has painted 
canvases that have been displayed in galleries. According to Medi-Cal rules, he 
is not sick enough to qualify for the intensive nursing care of an acute 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Firouzi was admitted to Northridge in November, 1987, for what was to be a 
six-week rehabilitation program. However, he remained at the hospital until 
earlier this month, when he was transferred to Temple Hospital near downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had sought to transfer Firouzi earlier, but he and his attorney had 
resisted the moves because they considered the proposed new programs to be 
inadequate for handling his medical needs. Finally, the hospital sought to 
evict Firouzi and filed a lawsuit against him in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Firouzi accepted the transfer to Temple, even though he was placed in a ward 
where most of the patients are comatose and the nurses require special training 
to provide for his care. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had an enormous amount of problems" at Temple, said his attorney, Marilyn 
Holle of Protection and Advocacy Inc. of Glendale. Protection and Advocacy is a 
law firm specializing in making sure that the medical needs of disabled people 
are met. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't a clue about the special problems of spinal cord-injured people," 
Holle said of Temple Hospital. "They ask him if something is too tight, or 
whatever, not figuring out that if you are a spinal cord-injured person, you 
can't feel." 
</P>
<P>
Holle has a lawsuit pending against the state Department of Health Services 
contending that its treatment of Firouzi and other ventilator-dependent 
patients violates federal laws that require all patients to have equal access 
to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
She also contends that it would be cheaper for the state to allow Firouzi to 
live at home with his sister, Doreen, in Canoga Park. Doreen is willing to care 
for her brother for eight hours a day, meaning that it would cost the state 
about $300 a day for 16 hours of nursing care. The state is paying about $330 a 
day for Firouzi's care at Temple Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
John Rodriguez, deputy director of the Department of Health Services, who is in 
charge of Medi-Cal, said it is impossible to compare the cost of hospital care 
to the cost of providing 16 hours of nursing. 
</P>
<P>
"Often there are other costs," Rodriguez said, including the installation of 
wheelchair ramps, backup generators and other expenses. He urged Holle to 
contact him directly to determine why Firouzi was not considered eligible for a 
special waiver program that has allowed patients in similar circumstances to 
receive in-home nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
But Firouzi's situation is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Rowland, 39, severed his spine three years ago when he fell while doing 
sit-ups upside down using gravity boots. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, which left him paralyzed from the neck down, he has been at 
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. The hospital, whose cost of treating 
Rowland has reached nearly $3 million, has been looking for a subacute nursing 
program where it could transfer Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, who is married and has four stepchildren, would prefer to go home, 
with the state paying for in-home nursing. As a compromise, Rowland would like 
to go to New Start Homes, a Chatsworth nursing facility that specializes in 
ventilator-dependent patients. So far, the state has prevented Rowland from 
pursuing either alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitude seems to be let's warehouse these people somewhere until they 
die," Rowland said of Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those who do qualify for in-home nursing care, there are barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Finding nursing care "is becoming our biggest holdup," said Pamela DeWitt, a 
clinical nursing specialist at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Childrens, two youngsters -- including one who has been waiting 18 months -- 
are ready to go home as soon as nursing services are arranged. Two others are 
facing a move back to Childrens from their homes because their nursing agencies 
have decided to stop providing for their care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care at Home 
</P>
<P>
One mother whose son was at Childrens for three months finally decided to care 
for him at home without the assistance of professional nurses. Billy Cothren, 
who suffers from muscular dystrophy, has required a ventilator to breathe at 
night since an operation in October. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first came home, I didn't know what I was doing," said his mother, 
Debbie Cothren, who lives in Claremont. "It was very scary. Even now it's 
bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "I didn't see any choice in this." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez acknowledged that the complaints of patient advocates and attorneys 
are sometimes valid. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a lot of good points," said Rodriguez, referring to the Advocacy 
Group for Ventilator Dependent People. "I'm committed to working with them. I 
will meet with them any time. I don't think they are asking for anything 
unreasonable."

<TEXT>
<P>
The body of an unidentified Latino teen-ager was found Saturday morning near 
Oceanside, apparently the victim of a hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the victim, described only as a Juan Doe who appeared to have 
been an undocumented alien, was found in the center divider of Interstate 5, 
about two miles south of the San Onofre checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Gill, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman, said the man had been dead 
four to eight hours. He was discovered about 7:15 a.m. by a passing motorist. 
No arrests have been made in the case.

MCMAHON DEBUTS, BUT CHARGER ROOKIE BURIES THE BEARS

<P>
The sad part about Jim McMahon's Charger debut and rookie Billy Joe Tolliver's 
coming-out party Saturday night was how they obscured another deceptively easy 
dominance by a Charger defense that is better than most of the rest of the NFL 
realizes. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, traded by the Bears Friday, received an ovation from the fans he used 
to play for when Coach Dan Henning inserted him for four plays at the outset of 
the third quarter. He handed off to Tim Spencer once, completed a pass to Barry 
Redden for 10 yards and threw two incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolliver replaced McMahon at that point and, before the period ended, lit 
up the lakefront sky with touchdown passes of 39 and 70 yards to Anthony Miller 
and Jamie Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this was an exhibition game. And of course, the Bears didn't think 
the Chargers' 24-7 victory meant much. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably doesn't prove anymore than last week did," said Bear Coach Mike 
Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
But don't tell that to Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator whose unit 
limited the Bears to 220 total yards and only 3.4 per offensive play. Neal 
Anderson and Brad Muster, the Bears' starting backs, combined for 30 yards on 
10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Point of reference: The Bears finished third in the league in rushing last 
year. Their only touchdown Saturday came late in the fourth period after an 
interception had turned the ball over at the Charger 12 and long after most of 
the starters had finished working for the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've seen better defense played by 40 guys," said Henning. Last 
week, the Chargers allowed just 206 yards and one touchdown by the offense in a 
20-3 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Henning had compared the Cowboy defeat to missing a four-foot 
putt. Beating the Bears, he said, would be like making a 40-footer. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-footer his team made Saturday, he said, turned out to be a "double 
breaker." 
</P>
<P>
The first break was the acquisition of McMahon, who might start against San 
Francisco Wednesday, according to Henning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an uplift," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a spark," Charger center Dennis McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say too much bad about him," Tolliver said. "My wife likes him." 
</P>
<P>
The second break was having the Bears on the their schedule one day after the 
trade. If this game had been played anywhere but Soldier Field, Henning said, 
he would not have used McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been wrong not to put him in the game," Henning said. 
"He's been here for eight years." 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Bears seemed more concerned about the quarterback who used to be 
their leader than about Jim Harbaugh and Mike Tomczak, who were auditioning to 
replace him. Tomczak, the probable regular season starter, completed two of 
nine passes for 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
To get McMahon ready for his four plays, Henning and Ted Tollner, the 
quarterbacks coach, kept him up until 3 a.m. Saturday watching film. "I'm not 
much of a film guy," McMahon said. "That was pretty tough." 
</P>
<P>
And after the game, McMahon looked tired, especially when he took his 
sunglasses off briefly. As usual, he needed a shave. And the print pants he 
wore looked as if they came off the hide of a zebra. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about the talent he saw on his new team. He talked about some of the 
tips he gave the Charger defense in a quick debriefing on the Bears' offensive 
tendencies. And he talked about what he considers to be his near future when he 
said, "it would have been nice if I could have played the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Then McMahon talked about his reaction to Henning's halftime announcement that 
he would start the third period. "I thought he was kidding," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tolliver was dead serious. Three plays after McMahon's exit, he 
found Miller outrunning Bear cornerback Maurice Douglass down the left sideline 
for 39 yards and a touchdown. Nine minutes later, Tolliver suckered the Bear 
free safety on a play-action fake and lofted a long pass down the right 
sideline to Holland, the Chargers' leading receiver last year. Holland also 
sprinted past Douglass, and suddenly the Chargers' lead was 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
In between Tolliver's touchdown passes was rookie Elliot Smith's interception 
of a Tomczak pass. Smith gathered the ball in after it bounced off intended 
receiver James Thornton, and he raced 49 yards for six points. 
</P>
<P>
An obviously pleased Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football 
operations, conducted an impromptu press conference at halftime during which he 
further articulated his reasons for acquiring McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"What he (McMahon) does is drive the car he's given," Ortmayer said. "And he 
doesn't drive it off the field. That's very attractive to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer was referring to McMahon's historically low percentage of 
interceptions. In 1984, McMahon set a Bear record by throwing 134 consecutive 
passes without one. 
</P>
<P>
It became even more attractive to the Chargers after last Sunday's loss to 
Dallas, in which David Archer and Mark Malone each threw an interception, and 
the Chargers lost two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Chargers, Ortmayer said, is defense. And McMahon, he said, 
has always been a good field position quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Charger defense was evident in the first half when Leslie 
O'Neal (two) and backup nose tackle Les Miller combined for three sacks. The 
Charger pass rush also helped force the Bears into two holding penalties. 
George Hinkle and Gerald Robinson had sacks in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took a 3-0 halftime lead on Steve DeLine's 38-yard field goal 10 
minutes into the first period. The score was set up by a 22-yard completion 
from Archer, the starter, to Miller. Archer played the entire first half and 
finished with five completions in 10 attempts for 74 yards. 
</P>

Tolliver wound up with four completions in 10 tries for 125 yards and the two 
touchdowns. "I screwed up more than I did right, I'm sure," Tolliver said. "And 
we didn't do a very good job of putting the game away." 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense preserved its shutout, momentarily, with a goal-line stand 
midway through the fourth quarter. The Bears had a fourth and goal at the 
Charger one when linebacker Jeff Jackson burst through and dropped tailback 
Brian Taylor behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolliver's late interception enabled Taylor to get a second chance and ruin 
the Chargers' bid for a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver had met McMahon for the first time at an 11:30 Saturday morning. 
"Casual conversation," is the way he described their initial communication. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim McMahon is cool," McKnight said. "This was fun."

PADRES LONG FOR LANGSTON; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD NEWS IN MIDST OF 6-4 LOSS IS THAT HE LIKES THEM, TOO

<P>
In midst of the Padres' 6-4 defeat Saturday night to the Montreal Expos, Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon could not resist taking a longing glance at the guy sitting 
across the diamond in the home dugout at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He's a California native, with blond hair, blue eyes, 6-feet-2, 190 pounds. The 
most appealing aspect of his appearance to McKeon, though, is his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
He's got one of the best in the business, and is quite capable of turning any 
contender into a champion. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
He's eligible for free agency at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
And the Padres want him. 
</P>
<P>
They want him bad. 
</P>
<P>
Shhh. You've got to keep it a secret now. It's a baseball rule that no club is 
allowed to talk about their desire for another team's potential free agent. 
It's called tampering. 
</P>
<P>
"There are heavy fines for that," Padre General Manager Tony Siegle said, "and 
I don't feel like shelling out money." 
</P>
<P>
But behind closed-doors, in private conversations while talking about their 
plans for 1990, the Padres have come to the conclusion that Langston is the man 
who could lead them to the top of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
And you know what? 
</P>
<P>
Langston revealed Saturday that the Padres could also fit into his plans. He 
told a Padre player Friday that it's unlikely that he'll return to Montreal 
next season and revealed to a reporter Saturday that the Padres indeed are 
among the handful of teams he'd be interested in playing for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the man who is the most-coveted free agent in baseball just could be 
wearing Padre pinstripes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here, it's a nice city and everything," Langston said, "but it's 
different. I don't know how to explain it, it's just different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from California, and everyone knows I'd like to play on the west coast one 
day. We'll just have to wait and see whether it's next year." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, born in San Diego and raised in Santa Clara, reportedly has been 
offered a three-year, $9 million contract by the Expos, with incentives that 
could be worth $11 million. But he indicated Saturday that he likely would not 
make a decision on the contract until after the season, which would also allow 
him time to test the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came over here," said Langston, traded from Seattle on May 25, "I told 
myself I wouldn't be distracted by this. I went through all that in Seattle, 
and it didn't do me any good. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm just going to sit back and wait to see what happens. When I get time, 
I'll sit down and go over it (the contract), but not until then. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably will be after the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, understandably, were delighted to hear Langston's revelations. 
While McKeon could only smile, knowing the ramifications of discussing other 
club's free agents, the Padres freely showed their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to show up early for the game tomorrow," Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn said, "because I want to know the scoop. I want to know just what he's 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be awesome if we could get him. I know there are good pitchers all 
around the league, and I don't want to belittle this staff, but there's nobody 
like this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Padres could also use more help than just a pitcher, with particular 
need for a starting shortstop and center fielder, McKeon says, but if nothing 
else, this season has proven has proven that the Padres' starting rotation is 
woefully thin. 
</P>
<P>
Take away Ed Whitson (14-9, 2.72 ERA) and Bruce Hurst (12-9, 2.98 ERA) and 
look, if you dare, at the numbers compiled by the rest of the staff in their 72 
starts: 
</P>
<P>
They own a 23-35 record and 4.85 ERA. They've allowed 476 hits, 245 runs (217 
earned) and 143 walks, yielding a whopping 13.8 baserunners per nine innings 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get on our pitching staff," Gwynn said, "because we've had our 
problems in all phases of the game. But experience is a big part of this game, 
and lack of it on the mound has just killed us." 
</P>
<P>
Take Saturday night, for instance. Greg Harris, making just his seventh 
big-league start, was provided the lead in the fifth when the Padres scored 
three runs, including Mike Pagliarulo's first National League home run, for a 
4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Harris (5-7) came to the mound, yielded a single, two walks, a passed ball and 
a balk, and just like that, the Expos had a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do that and expect to win," said Harris, who allowed eight hits and 
six earned runs in 4 1/3 innings. "The thing that hurts is not so much 
performance but that I let them right back in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pitched poorly, and I let the team down." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, McKeon said, Harris is best-suited for the bullpen. McKeon says that 
he's the perfect setup man for bullpen stopper Mark Davis, and having him 
return to the bullpen would allow Mark Grant to be a middle man once again. 
</P>
<P>
You get the picture now why the Padres lust after Langston, who's 10-3 with a 
1.91 ERA since joining the Expos? 
</P>
<P>
"I really believed we were the team to beat," Gwynn said, "but now I think 
we're going to fall a little bit short. He could push us to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still a good team, and we ain't far, we ain't far away at all, but to be 
honest we're lucky to be 10 games out. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before this trip that it was make or break for us. And now that we've 
lost four out of five, well, we're not showing people we want to win this 
thing. It's like we've reverted back to our old ways. 
</P>
<P>
"What have we got, 39 games left? To win it, I think we'd have to win 35. 
That's not likely to happen, but that doesn't mean we can't be a team to be 
reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Padres were the preseason favorite and are 10 games behind the 
San Francisco Giants with a 60-63 record, it would be quite understandable if 
the Padre front office is a little shy about assuming another huge contract. 
</P>
<P>
They acquired first baseman Jack Clark and his $2 million salary. They obtained 
free-agent pitcher Bruce Hurst, who signed a three-year, $5.25 million 
contract. And now to get Langston, well, it could cost at least $8 million over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing," Gwynn said. "Once we got those guys, the payroll went 
through the sky. And like we proved this year, it's not just about going out 
and getting guys. There are more things that come to play if we're going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong. I'd love for us to go out and get Langston and trade for 
(Cincinnati center fielder) Eric Davis because that would enhance our chance of 
winning. You just know that Langston could win 20 games very easily, and 
everyone knows what kind of player Eric Davis is. 
</P>
<P>
"But to get those guys means money. And if guys start coming in making big 
money, the guys that are here will want money, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting, real interesting. But my God, can you imagine what it'd 
be like to have a pitcher like that on our staff? Oh, man." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn said he fully expects to be back in right field 
at the end of the season, instead of center field, where he has started 77 
times this season. "I don't think they look at me as a center fielder," he 
said. "I think this is just a stop-gap thing. I'll be back in right next year." 
. . . Padre catcher Mark Parent's next start likely will be this afternoon 
since starting Benito Santiago usually is given day games off.

ROUGH ON THE ROOKIE; 
</P>
<P>
JEFFERIES SAYS HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE HURT HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a way, New York Mets infielder Gregg Jefferies concedes that he brought it 
on himself. He means those times he calls "just a living hell" of trying to 
live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Self-inflicted pressure," he calls it, because ballplayers are taught to think 
of the very natural fear of failure as something they can will out of their 
minds. When they struggle and aren't able to make corrections for the first 
time in their lives, it's a terrible blow. 
</P>
<P>
There were times, he said, when he didn't want to come to bat with the game on 
the line. There were times when Jefferies wanted to be alone and had no problem 
finding privacy to dwell on the game, and those times when he wished he didn't 
have to brood alone. The manager could put Jefferies in the lineup, but he 
couldn't make him one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
There is no textbook, no doctoral thesis on how an extremely talented rookie 
should be brought into the media spotlight of baseball when he is expected to 
be a force on a defending division champion. 
</P>
<P>
When those guidelines are written, Jefferies should be the case study on how it 
shouldn't be done. The process was handled poorly by the front office, the 
manager, the player and the teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies ought to be held least responsible because he is only 21. The others 
ought to know better. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Mets have shouldered themselves back into the division race and 
Jefferies is the second baseman again after more than two weeks of Keith Miller 
and Tim Teufel. Davey Johnson explained that Jefferies had "quality at-bats" 
against the crafty slants of Bruce Hurst on Thursday. Jefferies, the manager 
said, "reminded me of the way he swung the bat last year." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Johnson was looking for any rationale to get Jefferies into the 
lineup. Johnson thinks there is no way he can get from Miller or Teufel what he 
thinks Jefferies can give him. Maybe Jefferies doesn't turn the double play 
well, but his 29 games last season were a skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a kid who hadn't proved anything and I was compared to Pete Rose and 
Mickey Mantle," Jefferies said, 120 games into the learning experience. "I 
tried to close my eyes and my ears, but it's there. It's not like whether I 
believe it or not, you can't close the door to all of it. People are saying it; 
it's on you." 
</P>
<P>
He hit .321 from Aug. 28 on. He hit .333 in the playoffs. He hit Orel 
Hershiser, for goodness sakes. He was a switch hitter with power from both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
He was such a beauty they traded Wally Backman. They made room for Gregg 
Jefferies to become Rookie of the Year. That month turned out to be a curse in 
disguise. He batted second on Opening Day; he did not have the luxury of 
batting in the privacy of eighth or ninth. He was such a public beauty that 
teammates became severely afflicted by Venus envy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the least compassionate team I've ever seen," one veteran noted of 
Jefferies' hard times. He wasn't hitting and the team wasn't winning and 
Jefferies linked them as cause and effect. That rankled some of his elders, 
some of whom overlooked the fact that Darryl Strawberry had been portrayed in 
the same rosy light and struggled at first. 
</P>
<P>
Some veterans noted that Jefferies made it difficult for others to include him. 
One time in mid-July he sat polishing his bat until the traveling equipment was 
packed and the weapon had to be cushioned among the uniforms. Strawberry 
plucked the bat out of its repose and flung it across the clubhouse. When 
others wanted batting help, they went to Bill Robinson; Jefferies phoned his 
father. When the manager benched Jefferies for a game or two, Jefferies pouted. 
So Johnson was reluctant to bench Jefferies, fearful of destroying the 
youngster's usefulness. Teufel was expected to take it like a man. 
</P>
<P>
History says that even Mantle was sent back to the minors in his first season; 
Jefferies said he would see himself as a failure. And he was kept. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says now that twice he was prepared to send Jefferies to Tidewater to 
restore his confidence. Once Miller was hurt and once Keith Hernandez was hurt, 
so it never happened. The result was that Jefferies was seen as teacher's pet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the one who wanted it," Jefferies said. "That's the bad thing, that's 
what's going to stick in these guys' minds most. I don't want that to happen. 
That's what was said. That's what really bothers me; it's so totally opposite 
of anything I said or did." 
</P>
<P>
One time Lee Mazzilli, who once had lived through misguided pressures for 
stardom, assembled the players and spoke out for Jefferies. "It was nice to 
know he backed me," Jefferies said. Gary Carter and Hernandez counseled the 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Jefferies not drink, he does not mix well. "A few times I felt 
the door was kind of shut," he said of his teammates. If he had been hitting 
.320, whatever social graces the group dynamic requires and Jefferies lacked 
probably would have been overlooked. "Hitting does bring friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It tried him sorely. He says that blaming his hitting problems on the trials of 
learning second base would be an excuse. Some players can separate hitting from 
fielding. Some cannot. Jefferies wasn't helping in either way. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said I was the best player on the team," Jefferies said. "That wasn't 
the way I was brought up. I learned from my father and my grandfather that it's 
a teao. But I thought, 'If I don't do this or that, we're lost.' 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it. It was bad, really bad. It was a situation I want to 
forget. If I ever become a good player, I'll want to take a rookie to one side 
and explain it. I wasn't asking for sympathy. I don't really like that." 
</P>
<P>
When July turned into August and Jefferies' brief flurry faded, Johnson tried 
his version of tough love. He recalled Miller, slipped him in at second base 
and sat Jefferies down. "That was the thing to do," Jefferies reflected 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But when the manager used Jefferies as a late-inning replacement for sore-armed 
Howard Johnson at third base, Jefferies grumbled. And Johnson shut the office 
door one night in Philadelphia and gave Jefferies a reading out. 
</P>
<P>
And the next game Jefferies started at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Now Jefferies shrugs off what amounts to a second chance to have a month like 
he had last year. He had two hits off Hurst. "If I play, I play," Jefferies 
said. "If I don't, I'll do my work -- run and lift my weights. They see that. 
I've grown up a lot from the beginning of the year." 
</P>
<P>
It is a manly pose. His growth is subject to interpretation. He had that month 
and .226 is no encore at all. He may grow into a great player; he isn't going 
to be Rookie of the Year. He could save the season -- both his and theirs.

JOHNSON, SWITZER, SHERRILL, DOOLEY: HOW DO YOU FOLLOW SUCCESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NELSON, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget Jimmy Johnson, Barry Switzer, Jackie Sherrill and Vince Dooley. That, 
says a man who should know, is the wisest course of action for Dennis Erickson, 
Gary Gibbs, R.C. Slocum and Ray Goff. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go in worried about who you're following, you're in trouble right off 
the bat," said Ray Perkins, who followed the storied Bear Bryant as Alabama 
football coach in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're well organized, know what's expected of them and work hard, they 
can be successful. Then, I don't think they have to worry about the shadow." 
</P>
<P>
At four major football universities, the shadow looms bigger than life this 
season. Four of the nation's most high-profile coaches are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson left Miami to take over as coach of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. Switzer, 
at Oklahoma, and Sherrill, at Texas A&amp;M, left programs under siege by 
allegations of cheating. And Dooley retired after 25 years at Georgia, 
partially to make a shortlived run at the state's governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson replaced Johnson after two years at Washington State. The other three 
-- Gibbs at Oklahoma, Slocum at Texas A&amp;M and Goff at Georgia -- were 
assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an inkling of what was coming," Erickson said. "Expectations are 
extremely high. Losing is an unheard of word around here, and anytime you 
follow a successful coach like Jimmy, that's what you expect." 
</P>
<P>
Also expect resistance to change, endless comparisons and wave after wave of 
boosters and alumni with their own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was highly criticized for certain changes, changes that I felt needed to be 
made," said Perkins, who left Alabama after the 1986 season and now coaches the 
NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. "I was there to do a job and do it the best way I 
knew how. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some changes. I didn't go to cocktail parties with certain people," he 
said. "I was criticized for that, but I wasn't a drinker and I had better 
things to do. I think everybody expected me to come in there and keep 
everything the same. It was said, 'He should have kept everything the same."' 
</P>
<P>
Not only is that not always possible, it's often not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot of boosters, alumni and other people involved who aren't 
actually a part of the team," Erickson said. "There's a lot of 'coaches' in a 
lot of places. I think that's one of their favorite pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always going to happen," he said. "When you take over a program that's 
been successful and done the right way, people want to see if you do it the 
right way because they want it to remain successful. But everybody is 
different, and there are a lot of different ways to do things right." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs was a player under Switzer, then an assistant coach. Like Slocum and 
Goff, Gibbs does not have to deal with a recognition problem at the school. The 
team's fans and the school's alumni know him. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought about replacing coach Switzer or anything of that nature," he 
said. "I'm Gary Gibbs and I'll be Gary Gibbs, and I'm not going to try to be 
anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs and Slocum have a common problem that probably surmounts any caused by a 
well-known predecessor. Both schools' football programs were charged with 
cheating and stung by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really would like," Slocum said, "is for us to have a program at 
A&amp;M that, No. 1, is respected as a program with integrity, and, No. 2, is a 
program recognized as being well coached by myself and my staff. If we can do 
that, all the rest will take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We won three conference titles in a row with coach Sherrill. I don't have 
anything on my mind like having to win three in a row. I haven't done that to 
myself, my coaches or anybody. We'll do things the right way." 
</P>
<P>
The transition at Georgia has been relatively smooth for Goff. Still, there 
can't help but be problems when you replace a man popular enough to be 
considered a candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Dooley was here for 25 years, and he built up a lot of relations with 
people as far as speaking and going places, and when you step in the first 
year, people expect you to assume all the things he's done," Goff said. "I've 
had to limit myself in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
Following a coach like Dooley can be a two-edged sword, although sometimes the 
blade is a little sharper on one side than the other. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is, things have been going well here, and we just need to carry 
on the tradition," Goff said. "The bad part is if you don't oil it right and it 
slips, people want to know why." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened to Perkins. The Tide went 8-4 in his first season -- not 
good enough by Alabama standards -- then fell to 5-6 the following year for 
their first losing record since 1957. The world had come to an end for fans of 
the Tide. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition is not complete until you go through a season," Erickson said, 
"and it will be complete at Miami when we finish this 1989 season." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Perkins got Alabama going in the right direction again with a 9-2-1 
record and a 24-3 victory over Southern Cal in the Aloha Bowl. In Perkins' last 
season, Alabama went 10-3 and beat Washington 28-6 in the Sun Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"At a place like Alabama or Oklahoma, where there have been two or three, or 
even just one coach that really sets the groundwork for a great tradition, I 
believe the school and the tradition makes the coach," Perkins said. "The 
tradition is already there. Hey, it's hard for somebody to go to an Alabama 
and, if they work hard, not be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs agrees. It should work the same way at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a program becomes successful because of the efforts of one man," 
Gibbs said. "What we have here is a great program. Sure, there a lot of 
expectations, but we have those same expectations."

He'll always be remembered for pulling off the "Miracle of Miami," but 
Louisville coach Howard Schnellenberger wants to leave a more indelible legacy 
to college football. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win a second national championship at a school that never thought of 
winning a national championship," Schnellenberger said. "That's something no 
coach has ever done." 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it, it's Schnellenberger. He took over a Miami program in 1979 
that was near death, rescusitated it and delivered the team to a national 
championship -- as promised -- in only five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Now, entering his fifth season at Louisville on the heels on an 8-3 campaign, 
the mustachioed coach with the ever-present pipe feels his once-lowly team 
finally has the experience, talent and depth needed to "have a legitimate 
opportunity to win each game that we play ... and anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
But Schnellenberger, 55, knows not to raise expectations too high. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, the year we won the championship (at Miami), we had just come off a 
7-4 season. That was the year I had commissioned the team to go out and win the 
national championship," he said. "But (quarterback) Jim Kelly got hurt and we 
lost three games by one, two and three points. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back the next year with a freshman quarterback, (Bernie) Kosar, we 
weren't talking about winning the national championship. We were talking about 
winning consistently. We lost our opening game and came back and won 11 in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
Capping that "Miracle of Miami" was a 31-30 victory over top-ranked and 
unbeaten Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Schnellenberger accepted an offer to coach a USFL team that 
was to move to Miami, then to Orlando. But the now-defunct league decided to 
switch to fall football after one more season in the spring, and the deal was 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Schnellenberger sat out the 1984 season as Jimmy Johnson, now the head coach of 
the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, directed Miami to an 8-4 defense of its national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Sentiment then won out over logic and more glamorous possibilities when 
Schnellenberger, the former University of Kentucky All-American who grew up in 
this city, took over the Louisville program prior to the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought coming to Louisville was an insane thing to do," he 
has said. "But it was very thought out. This is my hometown and my home state. 
They were down. I wanted to take the team to national greatness for a second 
time ... and leave a legacy behind." 
</P>
<P>
Even 2-9, 3-8 and 3-7-1 records in his first three seasons couldn't taint his 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that what we're doing here is the biggest thing that's 
ever been done in college football," Schnellenberger said following the 3-7-1 
campaign, adding that non-believers were "know-nothing neophytes." 
</P>
<P>
"And when we make it happen," he continued, "Paul Bryant going to Texas A&amp;M 
and Alabama and winning national championships won't be this big. Knute Rockne 
taking that little Catholic school on the plain in South Bend and making a 
nationally prominent program won't be as big as this." 
</P>
<P>
Never say never with Schnellenberger -- a protege of Bryant, Don Shula, Blanton 
Collier and George Allen who thrives as much on a challenge as he does on 
dreaming up new wrinkles for his pro-style passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Schnellenberger said he believes Louisville is on a "collision course" with the 
national championship in which the only variable is time. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to his first season, the coach said the rebuilding process would take 15 
years -- triple the time frame he had promised at Miami -- because he felt he 
only had five players on his roster capable of playing Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between Louisville and Miami is that it took us three years to 
recruit enough of these young kids, get beat and gain enough experience to get 
to the point where we could win," Schnellenberger said. "At Miami, we had 
enough kids on the squad when we got there that it only took us one year to 
win. Instead of bleeding badly for three years, we only bled badly for one 
year."

HOME FANS SEE WHY 49ERS WON THE TITLE

<P>
Backup fullback Harry Sydney ran for one touchdown and caught a pass from Joe 
Montana for another as the San Francisco 49ers cruised to a 35-17 preseason 
victory over the Broncos at Denver Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Terrence Flagler keyed two scoring drives in his third consecutive 
impressive showing for the 49ers (2-1), playing at home for the first time 
since winning the Super Bowl last January. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway, scheduled to start at quarterback for Denver (1-2), sat out the 
game because his left knee brace was missing. He wears it as a precautionary 
measure to protect the knee, which has been operated on three times since high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Third-stringer Ken Karcher, who's vying with Gary Kubiak for the No. 2 job 
behind Elway, directed the Broncos on a 72-yard drive in the first quarter for 
the early lead. His 27-yard pass to Pat Kelly put Denver in scoring position 
and Rafael Septien, the regular kicker in the absence of holdout Rich Karlis, 
kicked a 26-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers struck back behind Montana with touchdowns on their next three 
possessions for a 21-3 lead. Montana completed 13 of 19 passes for 124 yards 
and a touchdown in one half of action, and has now completed 67% in the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
Flagler's 74-yard kickoff return set the 49ers up for a short scoring drive, 
capped by Roger Craig's one-yard sweep into the end zone for a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Flagler gained 35 yards in three carries on the 49ers' next possession before 
Sydney raced over the left side for the score. Flagler, a 1987 first-round 
draft pick limited by injury to nine career carries, rushed 10 times for 65 
yards and is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then went five for five to engineer a 61-yard march, with the last pass 
to Sydney for a six-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen 49ers regulars from their Super Bowl team, including seven defensive 
starters, did not play. Eight players remain holdouts and nose tackle Michael 
Carter headed a list of four injured regulars. 
</P>
<P>
New England 17, Seattle 12 -- Defensive back Jim Bowman returned a 
third-quarter fumble 21 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a victory in 
St. Louis' first NFL game since the Cardinals left for Phoenix after the 1987 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks drove to the New England six-yard-line in the final minute, but 
Jeff Kemp threw four incomplete passes to turn the ball over to the Patriots 
with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 26, Miami 10 -- Backup quarterback Cody Carlson threw two touchdown 
passes and the Oilers held the Dolphins to 200 yards of total offense at 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (0-2) managed only 29 yards rushing and 171 passing. The Dolphins had 68 
yards total offense in the second half, including five yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 24, Cleveland 21 -- Dwight Stone caught a 43-yard touchdown pass and 
ran 42 yards on a reverse late in the fourth quarter to set up the game-winning 
touchdown and lead the Steelers at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Blackledge, the Steelers' third quarterback, threw the winning touchdown 
to Weegie Thompson on fourth-and-goal from the Cleveland 4 with 1:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The game was a preview of the teams' regular-season opener Sept. 10 in 
Pittsburgh.

TETTLETON CAN FEEL GOOD IN BAD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when Mickey Lee Tettleton was achieving the ultimate in performance, a 
storybook career year and contributing bountifully to a winning team concept, 
he was dealt a sudden jolt that literally took his left knee right out from 
under him. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous Mickey to come from Oklahoma since Mantle had produced 22 home 
runs and was on his way to establishing a record for a Baltimore Orioles 
catcher. But then the knee locked and the searching hands of the surgeon 
uncovered cartilage damage and a cyst on the upper part of his calf. 
</P>
<P>
The team misses the thunder he can create with a bat, booming home runs and 
authoritative line drives. But Tettleton, after an operation 10 days ago, 
already has thrown away his crutches and is getting on with rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to be swinging lightly, off a batting tee, next week," he said the 
other day, "and then we'll see how it goes. I don't rule out being able to at 
least pinch hit in early September. The only thing Dr. Charles Silberstein 
doesn't want me to do is start running. That can wait." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton has accepted this cruel turn of fate -- which took him out of the 
lineup and put him on the disabled list -- with a mature reaction. He knows it 
would be foolhardy to start venting his disappointment by breaking up the 
living room furniture with one or more swings of his Adirondack bat. 
</P>
<P>
He's too well versed and wise in the vagaries of baseball to let the injury 
dismantle his outlook, preferring instead to recount and savor all the good 
things that have happened in a remarkable season. This is known as being a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
At a down time like this, Mickey even casually reflects on his days as a high 
school and college player. He is especially grateful for the decision that 
turned him into a catcher and, consequently, made all this belated rush of 
success possible. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the perceptive judgment of his two college coaches, Gary 
Ward and Tom Holliday at Oklahoma State, baseball might never have heard of 
this mighty Mickey from Oklahoma City. They first awarded him a half 
scholarship and decided he would make a good catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of blinking," is how Tettleton looks back in describing the 
position transition. He now works three sides of home plate -- swinging from 
either side as a switch-hitter and catching behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The important physical mechanics -- the shifting to keep behind the pitch and 
give the umpire a better chance to call it a strike, receiving the ball with 
soft hands, throwing to all three bases, running down foul flies, blocking home 
plate and deciding the sequence of signals -- are all in a day's or a night's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't become a full-time catcher until I signed in professional baseball 
with the Oakland A's," he recalled. "Bob Didier and George Minterwald spent a 
lot of time working with me. I had to learn to move with short, quick steps and 
be faster throwing the ball; not like in the outfield where you get to sort of 
wind up." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton says the lowest point he experienced came on March 28, 1988, when the 
A's gave him an outright release. But, as so often happens, in baseball and in 
life, the negative became a positive. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the Orioles called and offered a chance to catch at Rochester, 
N.Y., in the International League. He could have signed with other 
organizations, notably the Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds 
or Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be a backup to some phenom coming along," Tettleton said. "I 
wanted an opportunity to go to triple-A so I could play, not watch." 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely what the Orioles provided and here he is, a little more than a 
year later, blinking his eyes, but not behind the swish of a bat, as he deals 
with the reality of it all and how quickly fate can spread an exciting new 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton went from a veritable nobody to a somebody, and the Orioles, listed 
at 400-1 on the preseason oddsboard, have stunned the major leagues by holding 
on to first place in the American League's East Division for 93 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought coming out of spring training we were a young, talented team and 
that our main goal was to play fundamental baseball. I never thought so many 
good things would happen to the team and to me. I think we'll keep on winning." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton's wife, Sylvia, disclosed a family secret when she told sportscaster 
Tom Davis in an early-season interview that the reason Mickey was hitting for 
consistency and distance was attributable to a packaged breakfast food known as 
Froot Loops. 
</P>
<P>
"It brought me a lot of attention and recognition," he remarked, not realizing, 
of course, how he has influenced the eating habits of young America. "There are 
a lot of Froot Loop boxes coming in the mail for me to autograph. I don't mind 
it. If it helps the fans have a good time, then I think that's the important 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough for the natural right-hander, 15 of his 22 home runs have come 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton, with an erect stance and arms somewhat close to his body (the 
opposite of what most hitting theorists say to do) has been difficult for 
pitchers to get out. They've tried everything but novenas to negate him, but 
he, before he got hurt, was starting to see more off-speed pitches when he was 
ahead in the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to keep my arms comfortable, free of tension. Jim Lefebvre (now the 
Seattle manager) worked with me when I was with the A's and Frank Robinson made 
the point in the spring I was holding my hands too high. I dropped them down 
and that made the swing quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton is thankful for the opportunity that has come to him and decides it's 
much better than what happened to his father, now a director of security for 
Safeway Stores in three southwestern states. The New York Yankees wanted to 
sign him, but there was a disturbance known as World War II and Roy Tettleton 
had to respond -- with his baseball skills deteriorating in the process. 
</P>
<P>
So now Mickey Tettleton contemplates the future, of recovering from the knee 
surgery and then resuming a career that has become more noteworthy and exciting 
than his boyhood fantasies ever dared let him imagine.

JOHNSON CAPTURES SAUGUS FEATURE AS PHIPPS MOVES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Rod Johnson of Canyon Country rolled to his first main-event win of the season 
Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, easily winning the 40-lap Sportsman division 
main event before a crowd of 3,655. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening really belonged to Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, the two-time 
defending Sportsman champion. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, by virtue of a hard-fought fourth-place finish, moved atop the 
division's points standings for the first time in the 4 1/2-month season. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, 41, who entered the evening second in the standings, three points 
behind Keith Spangler of Northridge, finished two positions ahead of Spangler 
-- a value of four points -- to assume an unofficial lead by a one-point 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Will Harper of Tarzana, who entered the race third in the points standings, six 
points behind Spangler, gained two points on Spangler by finishing fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25-lap Street Stock oval main event, Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley 
cruised from pole position to checkered flag to earn his second main-event win 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Marlewski, who entered the evening seventh in the points standings, finished 
two seconds ahead of Russ Beckers of Sepulveda, who moved into second place 
ahead of Dale White Jr. of Simi Valley on Lap 22. 
</P>
<P>
Beckers entered the race third in the points standings, four points ahead of 
White. Had White been able to finish ahead of Beckers, he would have narrowed 
that gap by two points. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Ebeling of Monrovia, in the right place at the right time, capitalized on 
his good fortune to win the Mini Stock Racing Assn. 20-lap main event. 
</P>
<P>
Ebeling, who last month established a track qualifying record for Mini Stocks 
with a one-lap time of 16.62 seconds (72.20 m.p.h on the one-third-mile paved 
oval), started the race in 13th position and had climbed to third by Lap 14. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mike Frieson of Bakersfield tried to wedge past leader Tim Mitchell of 
La Crescenta while navigating Turn 4, both cars spun into the infield and a 
yellow flag resulted as the pack roared past the start-finish line. 
</P>
<P>
According to track rules, drivers are permitted to complete a lap begun before 
the yellow flag is waved. And Ebeling raced to the yellow, edging Mal Border of 
Tujunga at the start-finish line before drivers were slowed by track officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ebeling easily sped to victory, despite another yellow and one red flag. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of five main events, Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood sped 
unchallenged to win the 10-lap main event for Saugus Mini Stocks ahead of Jeff 
Walker of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Victor Nill won the 12-lap Street Stock oval semi-main event. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Sportsman division heat-race winners included Richard DeLong Jr. of 
Mission Hills, Herb Reich of Alta Loma and Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Street Stock oval heat race winners included John Schuetze of Simi 
Valley, Larry Durm of Northridge and Dale White Jr. of Simi Valley

COAST CHRISTIAN PHENOM EARL RHODES MAY SWITCH TO AN 11-MAN LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Earl Rhodes, twice named the CIF-Southern Section eight-man 
football player of the year, says there is a good chance he will not return for 
his senior year at Coast Christian in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes said he may transfer to South Pasadena High, closer to his home in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaning more toward South Pasadena than Coast," he said. "It's not 
definite, but I've been out there watching (South Pasadena) practice and I've 
talked to some of their players." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 205-pound Rhodes rushed for 3,829 yards and 58 touchdowns in the 
last two years, leading Coast Christian to back-to-back CIF titles and a 
24-game winning streak, currently the longest in the Southern Section and the 
longest in California eight-man history. 
</P>
<P>
After accomplishing so much in eight-man football, Rhodes said he wants to 
prove himself on the 11-man level. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of questions about me," he said. "People say I wouldn't 
perform as well at a big school as I did on the eight-man level. I see that as 
a challenge. I think I can perform just as well." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently there are a number of people who feel Rhodes can play at the 
collegiate level. Leroy Turner, Rhodes' uncle and guardian, said his nephew has 
received dozens of inquiries from colleges around the country. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley and Washington have sent the most letters, Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
With football practice starting next week, Rhodes hoped to decide by this 
weekend where he will finish his prep career. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pride, who coached Rhodes the last three years at Coast Christian and is 
now the coach at Webb in Claremont, said he wanted Rhodes to follow him to Webb 
but felt the school's high academics would have been too rigorous. 
</P>
<P>
"The academic load would probably be too heavy for him here," Pride said. "I 
told him that. I really hated to leave him." 
</P>
<P>
Pride had become something of a stepfather to Rhodes. He drove the player to 
Coast Christian each morning and lectured him on the value of education. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Pride said, sometimes his words fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Earl was slipping academically at Coast last year," he said. "He needs to get 
some things straightened out. Everybody has been trying to help him and he 
hasn't been trying to help himself as much. People need to see him do some 
things on his own, aside from playing football." 
</P>
<P>
The former Chicago Bears linebacker said Rhodes should have a bright future in 
football if his grades don't become a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts from Cal and Washington came down and talked to him before school was 
out," Pride said. "They indicated wherever he was, they'd find him." 
</P>
<P>
Pride, who coached Coast Christian to a 31-4 record in three seasons and was 
named The Times South Bay Coach of the Year last season, said he took the Webb 
job primarily for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a better offer here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pride has been replaced by Marcus Lankford, a former quarterback at Coast 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated to leave Coast, but I think it was time," Pride said. "We graduated a 
lot of seniors. If I had gotten started with another group, I would have stayed 
another two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
Webb, an all-boys boarding school located on 66 acres in Claremont, is trying 
to rebuild its football team after it went 1-6-1 and was outscored, 231-82, 
last year. The Gauls compete in the Southern Section eight-man Large Division, 
while Coast Christian plays in the Small Division. 
</P>
<P>
USC lost Hawthorne quarterback Curtis Conway to Nebraska because of the 
school's policy of not accepting players who do not meet the requirements of 
Proposition 48, the NCAA rule that stipulates incoming freshmen must score at 
least 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska does not have such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
USC football Coach Larry Smith would like to see his school abolish its 
hands-off policy concerning Proposition 48 athletes, especially those who do 
not meet the SAT requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a biased test for minority people, whether they are athletes or 
not," he said. "I think it has been proven many times over that it is not the 
test that tests whether an athlete is ready for college." 
</P>
<P>
Smith used Trojan linebacker Junior Seau as an example. Seau was the last 
Proposition 48 player admitted by USC two years ago out of Oceanside High. He 
failed to score 700 on the SAT, but has maintained acceptable grades in college 
and will graduate, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the tutoring here, I think Curtis would have had a good chance of doing 
well," Smith said. "It's probably a selfish attitude, but I would like to see 
us take one (Prop. 48 athlete) a year." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore linebacker Arnold Ale refused to comment this week on reports that 
his decision to transfer from Notre Dame to UCLA, rather than to USC, was 
influenced by outside factors. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the fact that USC is on Notre Dame's schedule, while UCLA is not, 
had anything to do with Ale choosing the Bruins over the Trojans, the former 
Carson High standout replied: "I'd rather not answer that. I don't want any 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Four South Bay football teams are ranked in CIF-Southern Section 
preseason top 10 polls. Leuzinger (9-2-1 last year) is ranked third in Division 
II, while Morningside (8-3), West Torrance (4-7) and Serra (7-4) are rated 
sixth, seventh and eighth in Division VII. Leuzinger returns 30 varsity 
lettermen and 10 starters, headed by quarterback Zak Odom, who passed for more 
than 1,000 yards in 1988, and wide receiver Quang Banks . . . Conditioning for 
Southern Section football teams begins Monday, with organized practice and

Woodland Hills West went into Saturday night's American Legion Northwest 
regional tournament game with a singular purpose -- to survive the game and 
take its chances in the championship round today. 
</P>
<P>
With six West players in the grandstands because of a suspension for curfew 
violation early Saturday morning, what was left of West lost to Vancouver, 
Wash., 12-8, Saturday night at Lewis-Clark State College. 
</P>
<P>
Most of it was attributable to an exhibition of single-mindedness by Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver used six singles in the third inning to score six runs and appeared 
poised to hand West its first defeat of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
West will play the winner of today's 4:05 p.m. game between Vancouver and 
Lewis-Clark for the championship at 7:35 tonight. The six suspended players 
will be reinstated for tonight's game. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis-Clark defeated Meridian, Ida., 10-9, Saturday. Vancouver (45-19), 
Lewis-Clark and West all enter today's games with 3-1 records in the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be very hard to regroup," West Coach Gary Gibson said. 
"Everybody will be back and believe me, these guys want it pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of the suspended players, West nearly pulled off an upset. 
After trailing, 7-1, West rallied to within 7-6, spurred by the play of 
reserves such as outfielder Gregg Sheren, who was three for four with four runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us played our hardest," said Sheren, whose chin was cut open 
and whose mouth was ringed with dirt after a headfirst slide into second base. 
</P>
<P>
West (33-6) scored four runs in the top of the seventh to cut the Vancouver 
lead to 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Geller and Ryan McGuire singled to open the inning, but McGuire was gunned 
down at second trying to stretch his hit into a double. Jason Cohen drove in 
Geller with a single to left to make it 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Kim followed with a single to right, Cohen moving to third. Greg Lederman 
walked to load the bases for Sheren, who then drilled a single into left-center 
to score Cohen and Kim, cutting the Vancouver lead to two runs and driving Pat 
Lamonica from the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lederman made it 7-6 when he scored on an RBI ground out by Jeff Marks. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver answered with a run in the bottom of the seventh on a single by 
Shaniko Ristau, a sacrifice bunt and a single by Travis Moore. The Cardinals 
added four runs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The West starting battery also included left-handed catcher McGuire, who spent 
Saturday afternoon trying to locate a mitt to wear. It was his first appearance 
behind the plate since he was 12 years old. McGuire was unaffected in the 
batter's box, throwing in three hits over the first seven innings to give him 
seven in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
West had only one reserve on the bench, right-handed pitcher Lance Gibson, who 
is expected to start today. The six players who were suspended were not allowed 
to dress for the game and watched from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
West, which had 15 hits, took a 1-0 lead in the second, taking advantage of two 
Vancouver errors. Kim led off with a bunt to third, but Vancouver first baseman 
Troy Flynn missed a throw from Lamonica, Kim taking second. Lederman then 
reached first on third baseman Don Slattery's throwing error, Kim moving to 
third on the overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Sheren gave West a run with a liner off the wall in left, scoring Kim. Marks 
and Chris Teich struck out and Lamonica retired Ricky Banuelos on a looper to 
short to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead evaporated in the third when Vancouver rattled West right-hander 
Geller (0-2) by sending 11 batters to the plate, seven of whom singled. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver leadoff man Scott Rabitoy opened the inning with a single to left and 
Steve Ramos followed with a single to center. Rabitoy was forced at third by 
Flynn, who reached base when West third baseman Lederman threw the ball away at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
The hit parade then began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Schafte, Slattery, Ristau, Brian Knight and Jeff Stephenson all had 
consecutive singles to give Vancouver a 5-1 lead. The sixth run scored when 
Lamonica grounded to Teich at first, who bobbled the feed to Geller covering 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Geller, who moved back to his more customary position at second base to open 
the fourth inning, allowed six runs on nine hits, walked none and struck out 
one. Five runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
West added an unearned run in the fifth to cut the deficit to 7-2.

SAN PEDRO ADVANCES TO LITTLE LEAGUE SERIES WITH WIN OVER HAWAII 
</P>

Hawaii Little League All-Star manager Myron Tamura was almost correct in 
playing his hunch Saturday night. He figured that the hard-hitting San Pedro 
Eastview All-Stars would struggle against an off-speed pitcher, so he started 
curve-ball artist Jason Adaro. 
</P>
<P>
And Adaro was superb, striking out 11, but even that wasn't enough to stop 
Eastview from winning the Western Regional Championship before 13,000 fans and 
becoming the first team from the South Bay to advance to Williamsport for the 
Little League World Series, which begins this week. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro opens Wednesday at 11 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time against the 
Northside Little League of Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 verdict hinged on a pair of curves that Adaro wishes he had back. The 
first, in the second inning, was lined for a double into the right-field corner 
by clean-up hitter Victoria Brucker, who eventually scored on a single by Joe 
Sulantor. 
</P>
<P>
The second was deposited over the left-field fence for a two-run home run by 
Tim Harper in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Take away four consecutive errors by San Pedro in the bottom of the third 
inning that allowed Hawaii to pull close and add some drama as the game 
mounted, they could have turned the lights out early at Al Houghton Stadium. 
Hawaii got all three of its hits in the first three innings and never got a man 
to second in the final three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were better fastball hitters, so I wanted to give them some 
off-speed stuff, "Tamara explained. 'I guessed wrong. 
</P>
<P>
On paper San Pedro figured to overpower the Hawaiian All-Stars. Eastview, after 
all, had averaged about 14 runs a game in getting to the final game. 
</P>
<P>
But Adaro was superb, tossing a five-hitter and striking out nine of the last 
13 men he faced. San Pedro managed just one hit after Harper's blast, but as 
the team celebrated the victory on the field after the game ended, it really 
didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd hit a little better than we did; that curve ball did pose 
problems for us," Manager Joe Dileva of San Pedro said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he was looking for the pitch, after working Adaro to a one-one 
count. 
</P>
<P>
"He was due," said Dileva of his No. 2 batter, who had 17 home runs in 
regular-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, however, Dileva and Coach Nick Lusic weren't pleased, particularly 
in the fourth inning when each of the infielders took turns making miscues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tendancy to do that once in a while," said Lusic. "We get a big lead 
and then slack off. But we came back. We are a very offensive ball club, but 
our defense is suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Sloan picked up the win for Eastview, his first in playoff action, but he 
was forced from the game after three innings when he was hit on the wrist while 
swinging at a pitch. He was scheduled for X-rays this morning. Harper picked up 
the save. 
</P>
<P>
Eastview jumped on top 1-0 in the second inning. Brucker led off the inning 
with a double just inside the right-field line, and after Steve Williams struck 
out, left fielder Sulantor bounced the first pitch from Adaro up the middle for 
a single, driving in Brucker. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro added a pair of runs in the third inning on the two-run home run by 
Harper.

CASUALTIES OF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
GANG MEMBERS HERE FOLLOW THE SAME CODE AS GANG MEMBERS ALL OVER, AND OFTEN DIE 
IN THE SAME WAY TOO.

<P>
Shadow and Peewee were just two of the largely unknown 8,000 gang members who 
ply their trade on the Westside of Los Angeles defending their turf, their 
honor and, mostly, themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But in one night, at a festival in Culver City this summer, they went from 
quiet anonymity to gang immortality. All it took was an unexpected run-in with 
a rival gang armed with knives, a 2-by-4 and a longstanding vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
To their own gang, they are heroes, remembered in "rest in peace" writings 
alongside their gang's graffiti. To the detectives, they are two of the 13 
gang-related homicides that have occurred in the Westside so far this year, and 
are remembered through grisly police photos as casualties of war. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference between their deaths and most of the nearly 500 
gang-related killings that police estimate will occur in Los Angeles County 
this year is the location. Although the Westside is known for its exclusive 
neighborhoods, upscale shops and general excesses, it is not known for its 
gangs. But as Shadow and Peewee's "homeboys" can attest, Westside gangs are 
very real. Their members live by the same code as gang members in the Eastside 
or South-Central Los Angeles, and often die in the same brutal fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vast Scale of Problem 
</P>
<P>
The murders of Shadow and Peewee, known to their families as Eric Aquino, 19, 
and Mario Isaac, 17, as well as a recent highly publicized gang killing in 
Pacific Palisades, point out the vast scale of the county's gang problem. 
Although Westside gangs constitute just a small portion of the county's gang 
population, with less than 15% of the estimated 70,000 gang members and their 
associates, they contribute to the same growth industry. Police investigators 
estimate that the number of gang members has tripled in the area in the last 
decade. In the last year alone, they say, gang-related crimes are up 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Police and gang experts are quick to add, however, that the Westside is 
probably as safe as any area in Los Angeles County, with only a tiny portion of 
the gang members truly hard-core criminals. But they admit that gang activity 
is creeping into million-dollar neighborhoods along the beach and in the 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Westside gangs are among the oldest in the county, dating back 
close to 40 years. But as is the case with gangs everywhere, things are 
different today. Gangs are more violent, they are more transient and they are 
less focused on turf than they are on drugs and money. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Westside gangs continue to thrive in the pockets of poverty that 
often border streets of great affluence, police say the things that attract 
home buyers and tourists to the Westside -- the beach, the weather, the public 
parks -- are the same things that attract gang members, increasing the 
potential for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
A weekend stroll at the beach is all that is needed to confirm it. Roving gangs 
from Venice, Santa Monica and West Los Angeles, most in their middle to late 
teens, can usually be found strutting their stuff on the boardwalk, "dressed 
down" in their club colors, the blue and white of the Venice Shoreline Crips or 
the black and white of the Little Locos. But the gangs also come from Compton, 
Pomona, Inglewood and Lennox, causing enough concern that gang patrols have 
been beefed up along the beach recently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still 'Pretty Safe' 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the Westside is still a pretty safe place, as safe as any," said Sgt. 
Al Thatcher, of member of the West Los Angeles Police bureau's anti-gang unit, 
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH). "But there are certain 
areas here that are as dangerous as any in South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Westside gang investigators insist that the gang activity is limited almost 
exclusively to poorer areas, noting that Bel-Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills, 
Malibu and other exclusive communities are virtually untouched by gangs. But 
affluent areas such as Pacific Palisades, which were little affected by gangs 
until recently, are now occasionally the site of isolated gang battles, such as 
the ones that led to the recent murder of Efigenio Vital on July 29 and the 
slaying in Westwood Village of an innocent bystander, 27-year-old Karen 
Toshima, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Fowler, a Del Amo Hospital drug counselor who lives in Pacific Palisades, 
says the Santa Ynez Canyon Trail, part of the state park system near Palisades 
Highlands, has become a popular hangout for numerous Westside gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The hiking trail is filled with gang graffiti, and a main hangout for the gangs 
is located just a few hundred yards from a private colony of 
multimillion-dollar homes in the Highlands where such celebrities as Chevy 
Chase live. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people up there that there are armed gangs hanging out there, drinking 
and doing drugs, and they look at me as if I'm crazy," Fowler said. "They say 
things like, 'in the Palisades?' But all you have to do is go there at night or 
look at the graffiti. The entire trail is turfed out." 
</P>
<P>
Police say they are not surprised. Sometimes, they say, it seems as if the 
gangs are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Plug Dam 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got our finger in an overflowing dam right now," said CRASH Sgt. 
Wayne DeBord. "And all we can do is to keep trying to plug it." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night, there was barely a trickle, and that made the 12 officers in 
the six CRASH patrol cars cruising Oakwood extremely anxious. If the gangs 
weren't at their regular hangouts, where were they? 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood is the historically poor and notoriously crime-ridden section of 
Venice, about 15 blocks in area, that police say is the site of some of the 
most conspicuous drug-dealing and drive-by shootings in all of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise sweep of an apartment building at 5th and Broadway that afternoon 
had resulted in five arrests in five minutes, with police confiscating 20 
"rocks" of cocaine and nearly $900 in cash from the suspected street dealers. 
</P>
<P>
But an early evening return produced only a few more arrests, including a 
surprise bust of four junkies for stealing a car. 
</P>
<P>
As two CRASH officers held guns over the junkies, two young men watched from a 
neighboring porch, drinking beer and watching the street scene unfold. It 
turned out to be a bad view: One of the CRASH officers went over and grabbed 
the two young men. 
</P>
<P>
"When did you get out of prison?" the police officer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Couple weeks ago,," the man replied, his speech slurred. His partner remained 
silent. The officer put them up against a fence and patted them down for 
weapons. "Aw, man, I wasn't doing nothing. I don't do no (gang)banging here any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Tattoos 
</P>
<P>
The officer raised the man's shirt, revealing numerous tattoos, including a 
woman's name and figure, a skull and the logo of the Venice 13 gang. The other 
man had a similar tattoo scrawled across his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you shouldn't be hanging out here," the cop said. "You're just 
looking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The two men were handcuffed and arrested for a parole violation: hanging out 
with known gang members. It is done without protest and with little fanfare, a 
routine for both the gang members and the police. It is likely they will meet 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this guy with the tattoos," Thatcher said. "But something must have 
happened to his head from the way he was talking. Might have been a bullet or 
angel dust (PCP), but he's just not the same." 
</P>
<P>
A few more circles around the neighborhood ended with the units converging on 
the Oakwood Recreation Center, where the officers searched for a gang member 
who had assaulted a retarded boy who was riding his bike to the beach. They 
detained five members of the Venice Shoreline Crips, then released them after a 
20-minute interrogation and a warrant check. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we sent everybody underground for the night," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
As have other units of the LAPD throughout the city, the CRASH unit has been 
engaging in sweeps of gang territories and arresting hundreds of suspected gang 
members. But they are just a small band attacking a monstrous problem, and 
police admit that the sweeps do little to combat the underlying social and 
economic factors that contribute to the gang proliferation throughout Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang-Related Homicides Up 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement officials estimate that there are at least 15 more gangs 
operating in the Westside than there are officers in the CRASH unit, which has 
had the same number of officers, 30, that it had when the unit was created in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Dina, head of the CRASH unit that covers four LAPD divisions, 
Hollywood, Pacific, West Los Angeles and Wilshire, said the 13 gang-related 
homicides are up from 12 at the same time last year. There were 21 gang 
killings in each of the previous two years, prompting Dina to note that "right 
now we're ahead of schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Dina said the jump in the number of crimes reported is due in part to an 
increased awareness of the Westside's gang problem and more expertise among 
police in dealing with the gang underworld. He said with the exception of 
certain areas, such as Oakwood and the Mar Vista Gardens housing project, 
residents are cooperating with police in spotting and reporting gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason some people are hesitant to report crimes is because of the 
potential for retaliation," said Salvatore Grammatico, president of the Del Rey 
Homeowners Assn., which represents residents near Mar Vista Gardens. "We've had 
more than seven different gangs operating out of Mar Vista Gardens over the 
years, but the violence is getting worse because now there's more competition 
for the drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
Some nights, neighbors say, the area resembles a scene from "Apocalypse Now," 
with police helicopters swooping over the projects, looking for shooting 
suspects and parole violators on the run. But some residents offer another 
reason for their reluctance to help police in highly visible drug-dealing areas 
like Mar Vista Gardens and Oakwood. They say that the police target everyone -- 
not just gang members and drug dealers -- in the sweeps, and that law-abiding 
citizens are often rounded up with the gangs and the pushers. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every youth they have out here, they affiliate with being in a gang," 
said Melvyn Hayward, a youth counselor at the Didi Hirsch Community Mental 
Health Center in Venice. "The good are just thrown in with the bad. When CRASH 
comes out here, they go crazy on everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is we don't have the type of relationship with the police that we 
should have out here. They're not involved in the actions of the community and 
they should be. What they really need to do is to (sensitize) the Police 
Department. They just get too big a kick out of all of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activities Not Separated 
</P>
<P>
Al Ortiz, a Venice drug counselor, agreed. He said any individuals who deal 
drugs in Venice are immediately labeled as gang members, which creates more 
conflict in the community. Gang investigators say that although many gangs, 
particularly Latino gangs, still operate as traditional turf-defending rogues, 
most black gangs, such as the Venice Shoreline Crips, focus primarily on drug 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The police out here believe that if they look like a duck and walk like a 
duck, then they must be a duck," Ortiz said. "But they don't separate drug 
activity from gang activity, and I believe that an apple is an apple and an 
orange is an orange . . . and that you've got to treat them differently." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, members of the CRASH unit say they feel as if they are under 
siege. CRASH officers cover a 122-square-mile area that includes numerous gang 
hot spots. And they say there have been 10 sniper incidents on police in the 
Oakwood area alone in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole gang thing is out of control," said CRASH Detective Bill Humphry. 
"Almost on a nightly basis you hear shots fired." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the gang wars have taken a toll. At the CRASH headquarters in 
West Los Angeles, a grim photo display of all the gang members killed in the 
unit's coverage area during the last nine years hangs on the wall. There are 
103 pictures on the wall, and officers are running out of room. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica police have a similar board, which, paralleling the city's gang 
problem is much smaller in size. Keeping such grim lists helps gang 
investigators do their job, for knowing which gang had the last pay-back will 
help them figure out which gang is due for the next hit. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the aid of the board, Santa Monica gang investigator Errol 
Southers can't remember what the score is. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ill-Prepared for Random Acts 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that the last person who was killed was on our side," Southers 
said. Usually he and his partner know. Southers and Hector Cavazos, are the 
only two gang coordinators for the Santa Monica Police Department and they make 
it their primary mission to get to know all the gang members in the 
eight-square-mile city, usually on a first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
But as with all gang investigators, they are ill-prepared to deal with the 
random acts of violence that are a staple of gang life. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Parga, 17, of Venice was stabbed to death in a midday attack across from 
Santa Monica College in April. Police said it was a pay-back for an earlier 
attack by Santa Monica gang members on Venice rivals. The attack was 
photographed by a passer-by, but rarely do the police receive such compelling 
evidence. Usually, they must sort through mounds of information on various 
gangs and their members while searching for suspects. They also try to track 
release dates for imprisoned gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time we make a stop, we take names, get as much information as we can and 
we always seize any gang paraphernalia," Southers said. "If the gang members 
want it back, we tell them that they have to come in with their parents so we 
can have a talk." 
</P>
<P>
If they decide to return for their belongings, Southers and Cavazos advise the 
youths and their parents of the dangers of gang life and strongly urge them 
never to don their gang colors again. 
</P>
<P>
"We explain to them that if they want to wear their colors, they might as well 
just be wearing a target on their back, because it has the same effect," 
Southers said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers spend most of their days checking the regular gang hangouts, 
talking to gang members and checking the latest changes in gang graffiti, which 
serve almost as billboards for a gang's size, movement and attitude toward 
rival factions. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, they know the targets. The Santa Monica Gang has been battling the 
Venice 13 and a West Los Angeles gang for more than a decade, but deadly 
flare-ups during unexpected gang encounters are a staple of the life style. 
</P>
<P>
"The gangs do have their priorities," said Cavazos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easier Ten Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, when there were fewer gangs, fewer weapons and defense of 
neighborhood turf was the primary mission, it was much easier to know which 
gangs were at war. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge John Ouderkirk, who was a Santa Monica patrol 
officer in the '70s and later joined the district attorney's Hardcore Gang 
Unit, which prosecuted cases involving the most dangerous gang members, said he 
can remember when gangs were not even an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There were always drive-bys and such, but it wasn't that big a deal and it 
wasn't nearly as violent," he said. "Back in those days, there was an ongoing 
shooting war between the Venice and Culver City gang, but that was primarily 
it."

The gangs remain primarily an outlet for bored youth, looking to join with a 
group, any group. "These kids are 'wannabes,' like any kids," said Southers, 
who, with help from Santa Monica city officials, is attempting to divert some 
of the youths from gangs through a series of classes and sports programs 
offered by the Police Activities League. "In this day and age, you have to join 
something. You're either a gang member, a jock or an outstanding student." 
</P>
<P>
All three of these pursuits offer the prospect of recognition. Jocks and honor 
students just rarely have to die for it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can find a picture of Shadow and Peewee together, it's like having an 
original Babe Ruth baseball card," Southers said.

LACK OF OPPONENTS PRECLUDES ELECTION IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>

Culver City voters are likely to see a low-key school board campaign this fall, 
and, for the first time in many years, Beverly Hills voters will see none at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Because Beverly Hills school board incumbents Fred Stern and Dana Tomarken face 
no opponents, the Los Angeles County registrar will issue letters stating that 
there is no need to hold an election, officials said Thursday. The deadline for 
filing was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, an investment banker who was first elected in 1981, said he was somewhat 
surprised at the lack of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I just assumed there were a number of people in the community who identify 
with a quality school system and would like to be a part" of setting school 
policy, he said. Stern speculated that the lack of challengers might be because 
there is "possibly no boiling issue upon which to differentiate themselves from 
board members that are running. The board members pretty much reflect the 
feeling in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Tomarken said she was thrilled to automatically get another four-year term. 
"Campaigning is a tedious process, a tedious task," she said. "It's tedious to 
get to the end. . . . I'm indeed pleased I don't have to go through that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Save $26,000 
</P>
<P>
District officials said it is the first time there won't be an election in 
recent history. Mary Ellen Figueroa, director of fiscal services, said the 
district will save $26,000 by not having to hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Egerman, a former board member, agreed that the situation was unusual, but 
added: "If either (incumbent had) decided not to run, I think you would see 
quite a few people (running)." Egerman, chairman of the nonprofit Beverly Hills 
Education Foundation, which raises money for the district, said Stern and 
Tomarken are "well respected in the community." 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, board incumbents Bob Knopf and Julie Lugo Cerra and challengers 
Jim Quirarte and Thomas J. Supple are running for three seats to be filled by 
the top vote-getters in the Nov. 7 election. Two-term member Kay Lyou decided 
not to seek reelection, mainly because her house near Elenda Street is to be 
moved this fall so that the city can widen the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Campaigning under those circumstances, I thought, would be a little 
difficult," said Lyou, 59, a free-lance editor of dissertations. She said she 
also needed a "breather. . . . I need to read a book that's not necessarily on 
education." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Accomplishments 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on her accomplishments on the board, Lyou said she was proud of 
helping to establish a health center that serves Culver City Middle and High 
schools, and of a J. Paul Getty Museum program that teaches art to elementary 
school students. She said she will continue to work with the district to start 
a program to help teen-age mothers stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
Cerra, elected in 1985, and Knopf, elected in 1981, both said they would run on 
their records of being accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Cerra, a consultant, said the district has to continue planning for the future 
and renovating the schools. She said the curricula must arm students with 
skills in English, reading, math, problem-solving and critical thinking so that 
they can be adaptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is changing so much," she said. "Kids today will not go into an 
occupation . . . and stay there throughout their work life. They'll need to 
change their occupations." 
</P>
<P>
Cerra, who belongs to the booster club of Culver City High School and the 
Culver City Historical Society, said she plans to run a low-key campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Knopf pointed to the district's technology training center and before-school 
and after-school child care as the top accomplishments of the board during his 
two terms. He said the district has to concentrate more on the "top 10% and 
bottom 10%" students, not just the average ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes Aircraft Corp. engineer said he hopes to run his campaign on less 
than $1,000. "I plan on doing a lot of walking," Knopf said. 
</P>
<P>
Quirarte, who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1987, is on the district's 
strategic planning committee. His priorities include increased communication 
with the community and a back-to-basics curricula. "This school generation is 
going to be the generation that takes care of me," Quirarte said. "I want them 
to be prepared to work in the global economy." 
</P>
<P>
He said that when employees at a bank recently misfiled some of his documents, 
they told him: "What do you expect? We're Culver High grads." 
</P>
<P>
"So they're not proud of it," Quirarte said. 
</P>
<P>
Quirarte, 44, who is in the jukebox and vending machine leasing business, is a 
former director of Culver City High School's booster club and a former 
president of the Culver City Jaycees. He said he had no criticisms of the 
school board, calling it "cohesive." 
</P>
<P>
Supple, a software engineer, has been on an advisory committee to the student 
health clinic. He could not be reached for comment.

BIG DEFECTION OF TEACHERS PUTS SQUEEZE ON COMPTON 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of classes three weeks away, school officials are scrambling to 
replace 154 teachers who resigned in a staff exodus that, officials 
acknowledged, is one of the worst the Compton district has had. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in trouble," said Joseph D. Simmons, director of personnel services for 
the Compton Unified School District. "I won't deny that, but I don't think we 
need to panic. We have been in this shape before, and we have been able to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter strike three years ago, the district lost about 116 teachers but 
filled the vacancies, Simmons said. Last year, there were 50 to 60 teacher 
departures, including retirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, Simmons had hired 81 replacements and is conducting four to 
five interviews every day, he said. School will open Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advertised Nationally 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe we have time to get them filled," he said. "People are coming 
in every day, and we have national ads running." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher union officials in Compton attributed the large number of resignations, 
which represent almost 13% of the district's 1,185-member teaching staff, to 
low pay and poor working conditions. The district and the Compton Education 
Assn. (CEA) have reached an impasse in contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Working conditions are not the issue, district officials insisted, because most 
of the departing teachers have been lured to Los Angeles Unified, where a 
teacher strike this spring resulted in a 24% pay increase spread over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we would have an exodus," Simmons said. "Once Los Angeles approved that 
large salary increase, certainly we were going to lose people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reason Is Money' 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is money; it's as pure and simple as that," school Trustee Kelvin 
Filer said of the teacher flight to Los Angeles. "Several (departing) teachers 
have come up to me and said how they enjoyed teaching in Compton, but their 
decision to leave was purely a financial one." 
</P>
<P>
A starting teacher in Compton, under the union's expiring contract, is paid 
slightly more than $23,000. Starting pay in Los Angeles is $27,000, according 
to Wiley Jones, executive director of the CEA. Maximum pay in Compton is 
$38,000, in Los Angeles $49,000, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is "pulling on all its sources" to replace resigning teachers, 
Simmons said. Besides running national ads, officials are contacting colleges 
and universities around the country. Even before the Los Angeles flight began 
this year, the district created a teacher intern program with Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Cal State Long Beach, under which college graduates still 
working toward teaching credentials can be hired as full-time teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of applications from the Philippines," Simmons said last week. 
"If I have to, I'm going to turn to that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Rely on Subs 
</P>
<P>
If the recruiting drive falls short, the district will rely on substitute 
teachers during the first weeks of school, he said. Simmons insisted, however, 
that the district will find a full-time teacher for every class and will not, 
as teacher union representatives have suggested, combine classes and cause 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers, he said, agree to be put in substitute teacher pools in other 
districts, with the understanding that they will be hired permanently if a job 
becomes available in the first few weeks of September. 
</P>
<P>
When they do not get hired permanently in another district, Simmons said, every 
year many of those teachers come to Compton and take permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of a district as large as Los Angeles, he said, the substitute pool 
can have up to 500 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Compton, which has about 26,000 students and is one of the poorest communities 
in the area, has always had a hard time recruiting teachers, particularly 
bilingual teachers, who are in demand throughout the Southwest, Simmons and 
other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Like several other districts in the area, Compton has teachers from Spain that 
it pairs with Spanish-speaking students. This year, 11 teachers from Spain will 
be teaching in Compton. About 20 Canadian teachers who have been in Compton 
schools the last two years will also be returning.

A MASCULINE COMING TOGETHER

<P>
The poster for the 12th California Men's Gathering, to be held Labor Day 
weekend in Malibu, asks the question, "Why gather?" 
</P>
<P>
The poster also provides an answer of sorts, a rationale for holding a 
convocation of men. 
</P>
<P>
"Taught to compete for jobs, success, love . . . it's hard to know who to 
trust," the poster declares. "Trained to kill, even on the tennis court . . . 
it's hard to learn how to nourish. Surrounded by voices of expectation from 
employers, parents and partners . . . it's hard to hear our own voices. 
Expected to perform, we die under stress . . . it's getting harder and harder." 
</P>
<P>
From 200 to 300 California men have been meeting annually to have a good time 
in a pastoral setting, be with other men and question traditional male roles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Roland Souza, a 42-year-old social worker and an event organizer, 
the theme of this year's gathering, which will take place Sept. 1-4 at Camp 
Sholom Malibu, is "Men Understanding Men." It will consist of workshops on 
relationships, fathers and sons, aging, and other topics. Participants will 
also meet in small groups and have a chance to play "non-competitive games," 
Souza said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Can Attend 
</P>
<P>
Souza, who has attended many past gatherings, said the event is open to women 
as well as men, although only a handful of women usually attend. In the past, 
he said, about half the participants have been straight, the other half gay. 
The event attracts people of all professions, although therapists, counselors 
and others in the helping professions are always overrepresented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the gathering, Souza said, "is men really supporting each other, 
opening up and being vulnerable and just having fun. There's a real spirit of 
positiveness that happens up there that I can never quite put into words. I 
always come back with a sense of optimism." 
</P>
<P>
Participants are asked not to bring alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Souza said the gathering is planned each year by a changing group of 
volunteers, many of whom identify themselves as part of the men's movement. 
"It's amazing that it's been successful so long because no one's in charge." 
</P>
<P>
The cost -- from $75 to $195, including meals -- varies according to income. 
Financial aid and day care is available. For more information, call 262-8019.

ARIEL IN LIFE AND DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
BITTER FAME A LIFE OF SYLVIA PLATH BY ANNE STEVENSON (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 
384 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, Mairs, a poet and essayist, attended the School of Criticism 
and Theory at Dartmouth this summer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To write the life of the poet Sylvia Plath in any form other than a 
"pathography," to use Joyce Carol Oates' apt word, may well be impossible. In 
the 26 years since her suicide, the circumstances surrounding her death by 
carbon monoxide poisoning -- together with the youthful breakdown anatomized in 
her autobiographical novel, "The Bell Jar," and the ferocity of her poems, 
especially those in "Ariel" -- have fueled the imaginations and sympathies of a 
broad readership. She and her fellow poets, Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell, have 
formed in the minds of many an unholy trinity whose lives attest to the truth 
of the superstition -- at least as old as Plato -- that madness and poetry 
cannot be disentangled. For readers who, for a variety of reasons, believe 
passionately in this fusion, pathography is apt to slide into patholatry. 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, Anne Stevenson, in "Bitter Fame: A Life of Sylvia Plath," avoids 
such slippage. Plainly, she admires Plath's work. Plainly, too, she understands 
that mental anguish contributed to Plath's artistic productivity, especially 
the "astonishing blaze of creative power" in which she wrote her last poems. 
But she does not propose either that Plath's poetry caused her madness or that 
her madness created her poetry. Nor does she make the ethically even more 
dubious suggestion that the unquestionable brilliance of the poems redeems 
their grisly price. 
</P>
<P>
The outlines of Plath's life suggest nothing of the turmoil and torment she 
felt in it. The first of two children born to middle-class parents of German 
background, she grew up in Massachusetts, was an honor student in high school 
and at Smith College, and then attended Cambridge University on a Fulbright 
grant. There she met and married another promising poet, Ted Hughes. After a 
couple of years in the United States, one of which Plath spent teaching at 
Smith, they settled permanently in England, where their two children were born. 
The satisfaction these circumstances might have brought, however, was 
repeatedly undercut: by her father's death when she was 8; by attempted suicide 
and four months of treatment in a mental hospital while she was in college; by 
her husband's faithlessness, both imagined and real, which caused her to end 
their marriage; and finally by her suicide on Feb. 11, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to account for an ending one can only perceive as tragic, Stevenson 
has chosen to read Plath's life in conventional psychological terms, although 
her "diagnosis" remains murky. Repeated references to "divided being" recall R. 
D. Laing's work on schizophrenia, but just as often she mentions "depressed" 
and "manic" extremes, suggesting bipolar depression, a diagnosis apparently 
supported by the doctor who was treating Plath when she ended her life. 
Stevenson makes this bipolarity her controlling metaphor. As early as high 
school, "Sylvia had a rare, infectious capacity for exultation -- as great a 
gift for rapture as she had for misery." Indeed, in Stevenson's view, there 
were two Sylvia Plaths: "the outer Sylvia, characterized by Robert Lowell as 'a 
brilliant tense presence, embarrassed by restraint,' and the inner woman, 
fraught with fears and aggressions." And although at one point Stevenson claims 
that "the writer was beginning to identify with the woman, the woman with the 
writer; there could be no true distinction between them," her later evaluation 
is more sinister: that Plath had projected "the 'desired image' (the required 
image) of herself as Eve -- wife, mother, homemaker, protector of the 
wholesome, the good, and the holy, an identity that both her upbringing and her 
own instinctive physical being had fiercely aspired to. Now her submerged and 
subversive self, utterly true to itself, utterly detached, completely the 
artist, turned on the Eve scenario and judged it a deception." This second 
self, which Stevenson labels "the real one, the poet," is not merely 
distinguishable from the woman but actively writing poems "bereft of all normal 
'human' feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait that emerges through Stevenson's words -- of a woman driven by 
ambition, intolerant of frailties in herself or anyone else, wholly 
self-absorbed and equally self-righteous -- is not attractive. But neither is 
it unsympathetic or unappreciative. In her able reading of Plath's poems, in 
particular, Stevenson -- herself a poet -- reveals her awareness of Plath's 
unique and stunning gifts. In places, indeed, she seems willing to permit 
Plath's mental fragility to excuse the ethical questionableness of some of her 
work, for example, the use of Nazi imagery in her best-known poem, "Daddy." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Stevenson's approach may well incur the reproval of the audience 
most instrumental in keeping Plath's work alive. Some feminists, working 
largely from Plath's own testimony, have interpreted her experience as a pure 
redaction of female victimization: The woman poet immured against her will and 
self-interests in marriage and motherhood by the husband who systematically 
undermined and overshadowed her. Stevenson's attempts to sketch the strengths 
as well as the weaknesses of the relationship -- and especially such statements 
as: "It was Ted who persuaded Sylvia to be true to her gift rather than to her 
ambition" -- will likely infuriate the Ted-bashers. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, am a feminist, but I am less troubled by this biography's attempts, not 
always realized, to be thorough and fair than I am by its conventionality. 
Familiarity with feminist and biographical theory might have led Stevenson to a 
more sophisticated and nuanced reading of this troubled and troubling life. The 
memoirs by three of Plath's friends, which occupy about 50 pages of appendixes, 
add little because Stevenson has already quoted their most relevant passages at 
length. More accessible notes and a substantial index would have been more 
useful. Clearly, however, "Bitter Fame" is not aimed primarily at scholars of 
modern poetry. As an introduction to the life and work of a poet of unsurpassed 
originality and intensity, it serves the general reader well.

By Ian Gregson, Gregson will be a visiting professor this fall in the English 
department at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molly Peacock was born in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1947 and now lives in New York 
City. This is her third book of poems. 
</P>
<P>
From the start of her career as a poet she's been interested in the attempt to 
speak intimately -- to speak about love in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"A Kind of Parlance," in her first book "And Live Apart," jokingly establishes 
an analogy between the calls of penguins and those of human lovers: 
</P>
<P>
 In the rookery they find 
</P>
<P>
 their partners by pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is somewhere between you 
</P>
<P>
 pressing against the screen yelling 
</P>
<P>
 Mol-llleee! and the sound of it 
</P>
<P>
 whispered in low registers. 
</P>
<P>
 She then describes a zoo-keeper talking to a sick penguin named Rocko. This 
calls into question the nature of speech itself since it's being used where, in 
the usual human way, it's useless. Or where it's reduced to mere sound: 
</P>
<P>
 Rocko came slowly under her arm 
</P>
<P>
 at four o'clock in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 She smoothed his head and asked 
</P>
<P>
 the questions, "What's 
</P>
<P>
 the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sick?" "What's 
</P>
<P>
 the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just those questions, many times. 
</P>
<P>
 The lover/penguin analogy is then resumed to show that speech between lovers 
is a problem of an equally radical kind. Partly the problem is that human 
desire can't express itself properly in words -- as she says in "Desire" (in 
her second book "Raw Heaven"): 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't speak and it isn't 
</P>
<P>
 schooled, 
</P>
<P>
 like a small fetal animal with 
</P>
<P>
 wettened fur 
</P>
<P>
 Its proper language is touch -- both Peacock and her lover envy Rocko, both 
feel "the desire . . ./ . . . to move / slowly under the arm of that woman." So 
she speaks in "Petting and Being a Pet" (in "Raw Heaven") of the desire to be 
fondled like a small animal, of "needing met by kneading of bone which is found 
/ through flesh" and continues: 
</P>
<P>
Like eyes make sense 
</P>
<P>
 of seeing, touch makes being 
</P>
<P>
 make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Here there's the old pun, very useful to Peacock, on "sense" in its 
intellectual and physical meanings. This is the crucial conflict underlying her 
poems -- the difficulty of speaking about the latter in terms of the former. 
</P>
<P>
And the breakthrough Peacock made in "Raw Heaven," and which is consolidated in 
"Take Heart," was to evolve a style that constantly, if implicitly, alludes to 
this expressive difficulty and makes it a part of her expressive means. 
</P>
<P>
This is to some extent a matter of rhythm. Her lines, like Robert Creeley's, 
tend to move nervously, circumspectly; her line-endings cause abrupt halts and 
awkward 
</P>
<P>
pauses. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Creeley, though, she doesn't believe that form is an extension of 
content. At times her form and content seem deliberately at odds -- as though 
the form is trying to contain something that won't be contained. There are 
sonnets in "Raw Heaven" where the pressure from within is so intense that their 
rhythms buckle and their rhymes distort; somewhere it is so great that they 
burst and overflow into 15 or 16 lines. 
</P>
<P>
This style is especially good at negotiating risky subjects and so is crucial 
to Peacock in "Take Heart" when she's writing about her abortion and the death 
of her father. (For in this latest book the central theme is not so much sexual 
love, as in her earlier work, as the demands of love made between parent and 
child.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Ghost," for instance, expresses her ambivalent memories of her pregnancy: 
The "ghost" of that pregnancy is a source of both comfort and alarm. Peacock 
makes a strange return in this poem to her theme of the need to be held and 
touched, here by this fetal ghost: "When I let it surround me, the embrace is / 
more mother than baby." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, she wants her dead baby to embrace her, as though it were her 
mother. This is grotesque but it illuminates the complex of associations 
connected with this theme in her work -- Freudian associations that link 
infantile and adult sexuality. For example the comfort that the lovers seek in 
"A Kind of Parlance" -- of being tucked, like a sick penguin, under a caring 
arm -- suggests this by placing parental and sexual love together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Plath makes a similar Freudian reference in "Daddy" when she links her 
dead father and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Now Peacock's style is quite unlike Plath's. It's a curious mix of the cerebral 
-- especially in her complex similes -- and the direct, even the raw, in her 
references to biographical and physiological fact (for instance, to 
masturbation and the smell of her mother's menses). 
</P>
<P>
But there's a link in the way both poets explore an obsession with their dead 
fathers 
</P>
<P>
and the effect they've had -- and continue to have, even when dead -- on their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
So "Take Heart" begins with poems related to the death of Peacock's father and 
thereby implies that the other poems in the book should be seen in the light of 
the poet's relationship with this overbearing and alcoholic parent. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly "The Ghost," with its bizarre reference to the parental embrace of an 
absence, suggests the wish to be embraced by an absent dream-parent: 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a dead little thing without a spinal cord yet, but a spirit of the 
parent we all sought to have had, of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 However, instead of this ideal parent, Peacock had a father who, when she was 
a small child, made her loiter outside the bars that his addiction drove him 
to, and who, when she was an adolescent, made her declare her love for him. 
</P>
<P>
In "Say You Love Me," the style that Peacock has evolved for dealing with risky 
subjects is used with great effectiveness. Pinned to a chair, she's cowering 
under her father who, although he's "hunkered over (her)" seems to be 
transformed by his need for love: 
</P>
<P>
Rage 
</P>
<P>
 shut me up, yet "DO YOU? " was 
</P>
<P>
 beginning 
</P>
<P>
 to peel, as of live layers of skin, age 
</P>
<P>
 from age from age from him until 
</P>
<P>
 he gazed 
</P>
<P>
 through hysteria as a wet baby 
</P>
<P>
 thing 
</P>
<P>
 repeating, "Do you love me? Say 
</P>
<P>
 you do," 
</P>
<P>
 in baby chokes, only loud, for they 
</P>
<P>
 came 
</P>
<P>
 from a man. 
</P>
<P>
 These lines are characteristic of Peacock in their telling awkwardness -- in 
the halting quality that comes from treating "DO YOU?" like a noun, and 
separating "beginning" and "to peel" by a stanza break. This is appropriate 
because it insists on the tangle of emotions here. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this is monstrous behavior on her father's part and it's not 
surprising that the poems following this one celebrate his death: 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of death is a release 
</P>
<P>
 from drunken midnight calls and 
</P>
<P>
 the unceasing 
</P>
<P>
 responsibility without control 
</P>
<P>
 of the one who stunted you. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stylistic awkwardness of "Say You Love Me" stresses that these 
feelings aren't simple. And given the context of this poem in Peacock's work -- 
which often speaks of the need to be loved, as it were, like a baby -- her 
father's becoming like a baby seems more understandable, if still unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Peacock's own response in "The Ghost" is similar to her father's -- 
she wants to reverse the roles between herself and her child. 
</P>
<P>
Peacock is conspicuously courageous in the subjects she is willing to tackle. 
That she's mostly successful in doing so in "Take Heart," as in "Raw Heaven," 
is because she's discovered a technique that meticulously follows the 
labyrinthine twists and turns of these emotional tangles.

THE PROPHET OF BLACK ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
VISIONS OF A LIBERATED FUTURE BLACK ARTS MOVEMENT WRITINGS BY LARRY NEAL EDITED 
BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ (THUNDER'S MOUTH PRESS: $19.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Johnson, Johnson is director of the Creative Writing Program at the 
University of Washington. His most recent book is Being and Race: Black Writing 
Since 1970. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 1968 essay entitled "The Black Arts Movement," poet Larry Neal wrote 
that "The motive behind the black aesthetic is the destruction of the white 
thing, the destruction of white ideas and white ways of looking at the world." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one years later, and eight years after his death at age 43, the black 
nationalist aesthetic Neal promoted has in a modified form moved from Harlem's 
Black Arts Repertory Theater, which he co-founded in 1964 with Amiri Baraka, 
into our classrooms, onto the pages of our respected criticism, and echoes in 
virtually all our conversations about black art. It is a poetics that "proposes 
a separate symbolism, mythology, critique and iconology" for black people, one 
that privileges politics over art. But before I say another word, let me 
confess that while I now strongly disagree with Neal's position, I was once one 
of many young artists influenced by his essays on culture and the historical 
events that produced them. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schwartz has collected the best (and most disturbing) of these pieces, 
along with Neal's poetry, and insightful commentary on the man and his age by 
Baraka, Stanley Crouch, Charles Fuller and Jayne Cortez, in "Visions of a 
Liberated Future." This is a book to be valued by anyone interested in the 
genesis of our current debate on how literature is affected by race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Neal witnessed the assassination of Malcolm X in the Audubon Ballroom 
in Upper Manhattan. He vividly describes this event in "New Space/The Growth of 
Black Consciousness in the Sixties," and the frustration felt by young blacks 
-- James Brown's "New Breed" -- during that decade. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the development of our remembered and unremembered history began to 
weigh down on us," he wrote. "And the more of our memory that returned to us, 
the sharper, the more acute the pain became. The more we probed our history and 
the history of the Third World, the more angry we became, the more we nourished 
our hate for the white world. . . . White people deserved to be hated 
uncritically. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Neal, recognizing the inadequacy of hate, saw how "We could never hope to 
develop a viable concept of self if that concept was purely based on hating 
crackers." Therefore, black artists had to turn inward, using their love of 
blackness as a first principle for politically correct literature. In his essay 
"And Shine Swam On," he wrote that "We will have to alter our concepts of what 
black art is, of what it is supposed to 'do'. The dead forms taught most 
writers in the white man's schools will have to be destroyed, or at best, 
radically altered. We can learn more about what poetry is by listening to the 
cadences in Malcolm's speeches than from most Western poetics. . . . The poet 
must become a performer, the way James Brown is a performer -- loud, gaudy and 
racy." 
</P>
<P>
Given these ideological definitions of art, Neal could not approve of many 
black works regarded by whites as masterpieces. "Our literature," he said, "has 
succumbed to the role of merely providing entertainment for white people." In 
nearly all these theoretical works, which proved essential for the shaping of a 
Black Aesthetic and cultural nationalism, he faults his predecessors for their 
lack of militancy: W. E. B. DuBois "was a somewhat stuffy intellectual with 
middle-class hang-ups"; the Harlem Renaissance "was, for the most part, a 
fantasy-era for most black writers and their white friends. For the community, 
it never existed"; James Baldwin "joined the tradition of pleading with white 
America for the humanity of the Negro instead of addressing himself to black 
people and their problems"; and he calls Ralph Ellison's 1952 masterpiece, 
"Invisible Man," "a profound piece of writing but the kind of novel that, 
nonetheless, has little bearing on the world as the 'New Breed' reads it. The 
things that concerned Ellison are interesting to read, but contemporary black 
youth feels another force in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, these are superficial, badly confused evaluations of some of the 
finest authors in African-American literature. And Neal, as he matured, knew 
this. To his credit, he became increasingly troubled by his own extremism and 
wrote the equivalent of an apology in his well-known "Ellison's Zoot Suit," 
where he celebrates the masterful use of folk culture in "Invisible Man" and 
declares that black art "has finally got to exist as good art also because, in 
terms of the development of a national art, excellent art is, in and of itself, 
the best propaganda you can have." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and '80s, Neal found himself re-evaluating his earlier 
ideas in brilliant essays such as "My Lord He Calls Me by the Thunder," which 
finds value in a black Christianity rejected by many other nationalists, and in 
his thoughtful examinations of Zora Neal Hurston's fiction and the philosophy 
behind the blues. 
</P>
<P>
However, his close friend, critic Stanley Crouch, concludes that Neal's "turn" 
away from ideology was tragically incomplete, cut short by his death in 1981. 
Crouch understands better than this book's other commentators how Neal's 
honesty inevitably forced him to look beyond a limited, racial aesthetics based 
on rage. "Larry Neal is important," Crouch writes in a fitting epitaph, 
"because he was one of the first who had been taken in by the self-separation 
of black nationalistic thinking to realize how little it had to offer and how 
easily it prepared the way for demagogues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An obvious commotion had started down in the front rows. Malcolm was standing 
at a podium. He stepped from behind the podium to quiet the commotion. He said 
something like, "Peace, be cool, brothers." Then it came. The strongest 
possible message, direct. The shots came rapid fire. Malcolm fell back, his 
arms flung outward like wings from the impact of the bullets hitting him square 
in the chest. Then there was the rumbling of scuffling feet, and the chairs 
were overturned. After it happened there seemed to be a pause, then the fear 
was everywhere. People scrambled for cover on the floor under the tables in the 
back, shouting. Screams came from the women and children. It seemed like the 
shots were coming from all over the ballroom (a smoke bomb in the rear, found 
later, didn't go off). Security guards were trying to reach Malcolm, trying to 
stop the assassins who now were safely escaping in the confusion. Ahada's 
daughter bolted out of the seat beside us. Ahada managed to catch the child 
before she could be trampled by the mob. A gunman ran by us, shooting and 
hurdling over chairs in his way. He twisted and turned, and fired at a knot of 
black men chasing him. The man was still firing as he ran out of the door 
toward the 165th Street entrance. He was being chased by several of Malcolm's 
men. They caught him at the top of the steps, and he was wounded in the thigh. 
Another assassin left by the side door, waving his gun, daring anyone to follow 
him. The whole room was a wailing woman. Men cried openly.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE CULTURE AND POLITICS OF LITERACY BY W. ROSS WINTEROWD 
(OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 226 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONJA BOLLE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Numerous writers in recent years have deplored the high rate of illiteracy in 
the United States and advocated political action to combat the problem. W. Ross 
Winterowd approaches the problem from another perspective. What is literacy, he 
asks. Is it the ability to read an employment application? The morning paper? 
The answer he proposes is that literacy is culturally determined. A practical 
approach to increasing literacy, he argues, begins with an examination of what 
is needed in this society at this time, how literacy is acquired and what it 
means. 
</P>
<P>
He begins with a historical overview, pointing out that literacy has always 
been an important political tool. He shows how various types of illiteracy are 
linked to certain mental abilities; introducing literacy necessarily changes 
not only a person's social position, but also his way of thinking of 
traditional life. Using examples from his own teaching, Winterowd illustrates 
how the individual learns to read, both at the elementary level -- learning to 
recognize words -- and at the level of "cultural literacy" -- learning the 
associations that distinguish the simply literate person from the educated 
person. He also discusses the common neurological problems that interfere with 
the process of learning to read. 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Culture and Politics of Literacy" proposes no easy solutions, it 
does provide a thoughtful and clear look at a complex part of human life. It is 
that rare book that offers something of use to everyone it purports to address: 
parents of school children, teachers, politicians.

HOW 'UNCLE JOE' HELPED FORGE THE NATO SHIELD; 
</P>
<P>
FORGING THE ALLIANCE THE BIRTH OF THE NATO TREATY AND THE DRAMATIC 
TRANSFORMATION OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY BETWEEN 1945 AND 1950 BY DON COOK (ARBOR 
HOUSE/ WILLIAM MORROW: $22.50; 306 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Josef Joffe, Joffe is foreign editor and columnist of the Suddeutsche 
Zeitung in Munich. He is the uthor of The Limited Partnership: Europe, the 
United States and the Burdens of Alliance (Ballinger). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does NATO make for a good read? No, especially since most people don't even 
know what the acronym stands for, and if you spelled it out for them -- North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, which comes to 11 syllables and 31 letters -- you 
would put them to sleep even faster. But Don Cook's "Forging the Alliance," 
which is really about something else, namely the "dramatic transformation of 
U.S. foreign policy," does make for an astoundingly good read, and an edifying 
one, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
It may have helped that he is no academic (though academics would have liked 
footnotes attached to the deftly chosen quotes from all the lead players). 
Formerly a distinguished foreign correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune 
and the Los Angeles Times, Cook has a natural feel and flair for the innate 
drama of politics. And so he has rendered a felicitous, indeed, suspenseful 
tale not just about the birth of an alliance, but about America's coming of age 
as a great power. 
</P>
<P>
Isolationism is not dead in this country, but in 1945, after almost four years 
of dreadful exertion, it was positively thriving. Traditional distrust of the 
British, weariness with the world, Roosevelt's recklessly naive view of Josef 
("Uncle Joe") Stalin all reactivated ancient withdrawal instincts. Perhaps for 
a "couple of years," and no more, would U.S. troops stay in Europe, confided 
F.D.R. to Uncle Joe at Yalta. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether Stalin purred upon hearing this, or whether he filed 
this good news, too, in a bulging mental folder labeled "Capitalist treachery." 
At any rate, six months after V-J Day, Stalin proclaimed that a "peaceful 
international order" was not possible with the monopoly-capitalists, directing 
his planners to channel what they had into rearmament. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his patrician predecessor, the spunky haberdasher from Missouri, Harry 
S. Truman, got the point even before Stalin made it brutally explicit. And so, 
on Jan. 5, 1946, he wrote: "I do not think we should play compromise any 
longer. I am tired of babying the Soviets." That day probably marked the birth 
of NATO, though it took until April 4, 1949, before the alliance was formally 
consecrated. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's special hero in this drama is the British foreign secretary, Ernest 
Bevin, who was the first to push the idea of an Atlantic alliance -- one where 
the United States would not just look kindly upon a West European defense 
organization, but join with Britain in a "general commitment" to "reinforce the 
Western European project." Even in 1948, when the Cold War was already in full 
swing, that was too much for the United States, steeped as it was in George 
Washington's famous Farewell Address injunction to steer clear of "entangling 
alliances." 
</P>
<P>
So, in a way, Cook ought to have "dedicated" his book to none other than Uncle 
Joe, the unwitting, unwilling father of NATO. Democracies, as Tocqueville had 
so eloquently explained in his American treatise more than 100 years before, do 
not take easily to notions of reason of state, the balance of power or 
realpolitik. Indeed, America, the only true child of the Enlightenment, was 
conceived in opposition to those corrupting "games of princes." 
</P>
<P>
When the United States went to war, it was then never for the sake of interests 
but always and only of ideals. Evil, not encroachment, had to be fought -- at 
least, this is how leaders had to put it to a populace surrounded not by 
jealous rivals, but by vast expanses of land and water. It was the nastiness of 
Kaiser Bill and the sheer evil of Adolf Hitler rather than the menace of German 
power that galvanized Americans for the cause of war, and then only after the 
bad guys drew first. 
</P>
<P>
How then to build an alliance to prevent war -- in corrupt old Europe, to boot, 
on which most Americans-to-be had gladly turned their backs. The short answer 
is: with the indispensable help of Joe Stalin, who did his worst to persuade 
hesitant Americans: by suppressing Polish freedom, extending his covetous hand 
for Greece and Turkey, sweeping away democracy in Prague, finally, by making a 
grab for West Berlin, the Western enclave deep inside the Soviet Occupation 
Zone in the summer of 1948. 
</P>
<P>
The longer, eminently readable answer is Cook's, who manages to tell the story 
with a master playwright's skill, except that the protagonists -- Americans, 
British, Continental and Russian leaders -- all declaim their own prose. 
"Berlin was the high point of Stalin's postwar challenge," notes Cook, and this 
is where "the hinge of fate turned for the West." 
</P>
<P>
But the Berlin Blockade was over in May, 1949, one month after the North 
Atlantic Treaty had been signed. And the treaty was hardly more than a piece of 
paper unless Congress voted billions of defense dollars to infuse it with the 
reality of guns and GIs. And so Stalin had to lend a helping hand once more -- 
by exploding the first Soviet atom bomb in September, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again," recorded Secretary of State Dean Acheson, "the Russians had come 
to the aid of an imperiled nonpartisan foreign policy, binding its wound and 
rallying the divided Congress into accepting . . . the Mutual Defense 
Assistance program." And so, Stalin richly deserved to be included in the 
author's photo gallery of the cast of characters: from Adenauer to Sen. 
Vandenberg, from Bevin and Churchill to Gens. Clay and Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
They, but above all Stalin, were "Present at the Creation" -- thus the title of 
Acheson's memoirs. And they have left behind an institution that has turned out 
to be the longest-lived coalition of free nations in history. That is not a bad 
record for an alliance forged against the historical instincts of its leader 
and sustainer. Indeed, it is that "entangling alliance" that marks America's 
haphazard maturing as a great power -- that must shoulder the burden not just 
because the occasional bad guy has to be chastened, but because world power 
equals world responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of success have shrouded the origins of NATO in the mist of ancient 
history. Cook, who was there when it happened, has brought the creators to life 
again with a fine sense for the adventure of politics among nations. The 
Alliance could not have found a more accomplished director-writer for the 
re-enactment of the "dramatic transformation" of U.S. policy.

FAULKNER BEFOULED; 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM FAULKNER AMERICAN WRITER BY FREDERICK R. KARL (WEIDENFELD &amp; 
NICOLSON: $37.50; 1,131 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 1-55584-088-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Molly Giles, Giles' collection of short stories, Rough Translations 
(University of Georgia Press), won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short 
Fiction. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was known in Oxford, Miss. as "Count No Count," the town bum. He was a 
scruffy young man in a ragged jacket who drank most of the night and hung 
around the golf course most of the day. He did some house painting, some 
gambling, some wheeling and dealing, but most of his income came from handouts 
from friends and his mother. He was a slight man -- only 5 feet, 5 inches tall 
-- with a bad back. He walked with a limp, and sometimes carried a cane. He was 
subject to hiccup fits that lasted for days, talked in an unintelligible 
mumble, drove around in an old car he'd painted white, and had disastrous luck 
with women. One ex-girl-friend described him as "a fuzzy little animal"; 
everyone in town, she said, knew he was nothing but a "screwball." 
</P>
<P>
This screwball was William Faulkner in 1920, or rather, it was one side of 
William Faulkner in 1920, for Faulkner was never exactly who he appeared to be 
to any one person at any one time. He was always playing a role. Toward the end 
of their long and disastrous marriage, his wife Estelle decided that there were 
"two Bills. He is so definitely dual . . . Perhaps artists must needs be." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick R. Karl, in this new and rather nasty biography, contends there were 
more than merely "two Bills"; simple duality was a piece of cake for someone as 
complex as Faulkner. "America's greatest novelist of the twentieth century," 
was also, Karl argues, one of America's greatest con men. He was a parasite, a 
poseur, and a prevaricator; he "desperately wanted to be a great writer, but he 
wanted just as desperately to be an epic hero." To this end he invented a 
glamorous history for himself as a war hero, threw himself into "male 
activities" such as hunting, flying, and horsemanship, played at town tramp as, 
later, he would play at Lord of the Manor. 
</P>
<P>
"All writers hide," Karl assures us, "but Faulkner hid more. All writers play 
roles, but Faulkner played a great variety of them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the "roles" Faulkner played were thrust upon him; some he assumed. He 
came from an alcoholic and violent family; his great-grandfather was murdered, 
and both his grandfather and father were wounded by gunmen. As the oldest of 
four boys, Faulkner had an idyllic childhood, free to wander in the woods on 
his Shetland pony until age 8, when he started school. (He never did think much 
of formal education, and dropped out in the 10th grade.) He went to Canada and 
joined the RAF in 1918, but World War I was almost over and he soon returned to 
Oxford, where he was given a job at the post office. He was a Boy Scout leader 
for a short time (he was eventually fired for drinking) and began to attend a 
few classes at the university. 
</P>
<P>
He met other writers, among them Sherwood Anderson, who encouraged and 
influenced him. His first novel, "Soldier's Pay," was published in 1925, 
followed by "Mosquitos," "Sartoris," "The Sound and the Fury," "Sanctuary," "As 
I Lay Dying," and "Light in August." During this time Faulkner was also writing 
short stories for magazines in New York and screenplays for Howard Hawks in 
Hollywood. He married his childhood sweetheart in 1929 and spent the last half 
of his life (he died in 1962 at age 65) in a flurry of accomplishment and 
honors; he received the National Book Award twice, won the Nobel Prize for 
Literature in 1949 and acted as good will ambassador to Japan and Greece. It 
was not all glory; there were personal problems and money problems and drinking 
problems and problems of the heart. Whether all these problems were calculated 
crises that Faulkner handled through "roles" and "poses" remains, however, one 
of the major problems of Karl's book. 
</P>
<P>
There are others. Karl's biography, which runs, 1,131 pages and weighs almost 2 
1/2 pounds, is burdened with bad writing, pop psychology, glib literary 
criticism, unsubstantiated "scholarship" and a humorless moral outrage that 
rarely flags. His attitude toward his subject soon becomes the real subject of 
"William Faulkner: American Writer," and his attitude is, in a word, negative. 
Karl doesn't like Faulkner, in any of his roles. He doesn't like his looks (we 
are told repeatedly that Faulkner was small, slight, effeminate and 
characterless with "a large beaklike nose" that, Karl marvels, remained "a 
distinctive feature . . . until his death"). Faulkner's writing is described as 
"an obsessional need to put words on paper" and we are warned that during his 
whole life, "Faulkner pecked away at his typewriter, "spewing short stories as 
if programmed," like "an engine chugging along." Faulkner's ability to support 
an enormous extended family is seen "a form of control," his purchase of a 
house and land is seen as a need for "identification," his patience and 
endurance are a response to "self-pity." Telling us that Faulkner showered 
before making love and sneezed into a handkerchief, Karl concludes the writer 
had an "uneasiness about his . . . bodily functions, perhaps a corollary of the 
early years when he was rejected by women and began to form a poor image of 
himself as a man." We are told Faulkner was a lousy pilot, a rotten horseman, 
and in serious need of psychiatric care, "especially in his relationship with 
his mother. That area," Karl broods, "was ripe for picking, although in 
precisely what ways we can only speculate." 
</P>
<P>
About the only area where Karl is willing to let Faulkner off the hook is, 
oddly, in the area of his drinking. He seems to forgive the drinking as "part 
of some grand mystery" that enabled Faulkner to continue his work: It "may have 
been suicidal for the man, but it was joy and delight for the writer." 
</P>
<P>
Karl's earnest, sullen, heavy-footed approach has worked well for him in the 
past -- his biography of Joseph Conrad is, to some anyway, a classic. But 
Faulkner is too slippery for him. The only bright bits in the book come from 
Faulkner's own direct quotes, and the only truly interesting thread through the 
narrative is Faulkner's quiet growth as a writer. Underneath all the bluff 
about male bonding and anal control, a picture emerges of a solitary man rising 
at 4 in the morning to face a typewriter, day after day, and this man is no 
"screwball," no "bum," no "Freudian case," nor even a Nobel Prize winner; this 
man is just William Faulkner, and he is infinitely, triumphantly, mysterious.

VARIETIES OF FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WITHIN THE RIBBONS BY FRANK MANLEY (NORTH POINT PRESS: $16.95; 256 PP.; 
0-86547-379-X) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Grace Edwards-Yearwood, Edwards-Yearwood's novel, In the Shadow of the 
Peacock, was recently issued in paper by Ballantine Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Manley, a professor of English at Emory University and the recipient of 
two Guggenheim fellowships, creates a remarkable world in this fine collection 
of short stories. All of his characters share a common denominator: They 
inhabit and are inhibited by worlds from which they try desperately to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Manley takes us into small spaces, indwelling and claustrophobic, where events 
spin out of control in a matter of seconds. In "Within the Ribbons," the title 
story, Daisy Feed, who had spent her life caring for her recently deceased 
mother, confesses to her friend that she has never been to a wedding. Her 
friend, Amelia Thorlew, a study of easy alarm and good intentions, replies, "I 
go to a wedding once a year. Sometimes twice. And sometimes it just comes in 
bunches. I don't even get back home and take my bicarbonate of soda sometimes 
when here comes another and I got to get sick all over again." 
</P>
<P>
So Daisy accompanies Amelia to the next wedding and Manley, in detailing the 
surreal aspects of the event, draws us into Daisy's inner core. 
</P>
<P>
She gets to sit within the ribbons -- the church pews reserved for family 
members -- but spiritually and physically, she remains on the periphery, 
longing to connect. Yet when the bride tosses the bouquet, she steps back. " 
'Why didn't you get it?' Amelia asked, trying to kick it with her foot. The 
bridesmaids were still screaming and scrabbling. 'You could have got it. She 
aimed it at you.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I didn't want it,' Daisy Feed said. 'I wouldn't know what to do with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The wedding is a rich, vulgar and graceless affair that Manley describes in 
trenchant language: " 'Wait a minute.' The young men rushed up. 'Look here,' 
one of them said. He held out a plate of shrimp.' " 
</P>
<P>
"How do you eat it?" 
</P>
<P>
"With a fork." 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any." 
</P>
<P>
"Daisy Feed looked at the plate, then at the table. There was nothing to eat 
the shrimp with. 'I don't know,' Daisy Feed said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's what I mean,' the young man said.' 'They got it fixed where you can't 
eat it.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Hey, try a toothpick,' one said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Look how I do,' the other one said, and he opened one of the sandwiches and 
with a piece of bread dug at the pile of shrimp on his plate as though he was 
mopping it up with a towel. Then he thrust it in his mouth. Most of it got in. 
The rest rolled down the front of his suit onto the floor. 'Goddamn,' one said. 
'Son of a bitch,' said the other. They both stopped to clean it up, and Daisy 
Feed left." 
</P>
<P>
Amid this confusion, Daisy glimpses an ephemeral figure, more shadow than man, 
who slips in and out of her line of vision. At first, she imagines he is a 
thief, then she realizes that she alone sees him and she alone knows that his 
presence portends fulfillment and disaster of horrifying proportions. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Joy Forever," the characters are finely drawn against a background richly 
detailed to illuminate the dynamics of small town corruption and the casual 
cruelty hidden behind a curtain of soft Southern gentility. 
</P>
<P>
Mattie Chadwick, a spinster buoyed by a new interpretation of Scripture, is 
moved to fight the powers who have closed a rural road, a road to the past that 
must remain open. "That road goes back to the beginning of time . . . I go down 
there, and the rocks are the same, and the trees are the same, and the river, 
it's still the same and it's like I step back. It's important to me. I can't 
live just here. Living here without that road opens like plants living without 
their roots. They shrivel up and die in a day." 
</P>
<P>
Manley pulls us along, almost submerging us in a subterranean current of 
sexuality as Mattie tries to enlist the help of her neighbors -- the 
pistol-packing Widow Grizzle and her three daughters. Her quixotic crusade is 
nearly sidetracked by the women's intense preoccupation with the thought and 
threat of rape; their obsessive attempts to define and describe, within the 
limits of their experience, aggravated sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
Mattie then describes her encounter with the commissioner of roads: "It's like 
he was violating me. One time they robbed me when I wasn't there. My momma and 
daddy just died the year before, and I was out down at the river. It was still 
light, and I got back just before supper, and the door was standing open. It 
was the fall, and it was cold. When I saw it open, I knew something was wrong, 
and I crept up and looked in the windows. It's like somebody lifted my skirt. 
'Oh, God,' Althie said. She clutched her hands. 
</P>
<P>
Mattie continues: " . . . and it was like they did something to me -- lifted my 
skirt and did what they do, and I couldn't stop them. That's how I feel about 
that road -- if I let them, that's what they'd do." 
</P>
<P>
Mattie lets the commissioner know that she intends to fight. To the threat 
implicit in his response, she replies, "That's why I'm doing it, Benny. I don't 
care if I die, anyway. I figure I'm a joy forever." 
</P>
<P>
There are several battles being waged on different fronts. For Mrs. Grizzle, 
the road is a path to the past that should remain closed. "All that talk about 
opening the road and going back there where you were a child and all that talk 
about old lives. That got her (one of her daughters) stirred up and thinking 
about things she wished she hadn't. Let sleeping dogs lie. Better just forget 
about some things. We do what we can. That's all we know how to. And sometimes 
our children forgive us, and sometimes they don't." 
</P>
<P>
But the conversation rolls out of control, assuming a power of its own, 
plumbing the well of memory until finally the image of Reverend Grizzle, 
reeking of incest cloaked in religious ritual, is brought to life, forcing an 
act of personal absolution that is at once pathetic and bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
The urge to escape spirals to comic dimensions in "The Call of Nature." Dortis 
Mulkey, a young thief who specializes in stealing anything on wheels (go-carts, 
dune buggies, tractors, bulldozers, etc.) swipes a car parked in a shopping 
center. He takes off. No particular destination. 
</P>
<P>
In his haste, he neglects to check the back seat and like most thieves who get 
tripped up by minor details, he finds that he has taken a dotty and feisty old 
woman along for the ride. The dialogue here is wonderful and vivid. Dortis 
discovers that the woman, Lucille Arp, wants to get away also. She wants to get 
back to Unadilla, Ga. Back to where she once knew what it was to be happy and 
also to fulfill her life-long ambition to become a reader/adviser. She 
envisions Dortis as a gift sent from heaven and insists that he drive her. 
Dortis, recovering from the shock, "was listening to the tires. The tires were 
saying, 'Unadilla-kiss-my -- Unadilla-kiss-my -- .' " 
</P>
<P>
He develops a plan: Take the car to the nearest car wash and there, abandon the 
old lady. "Dortis Mulkey started to slow down. 'Why are we stopping?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'This's the car wash.' Dortis Mulkey said. It was at the rear of a filling 
station, a long tunnel with red and white brushes. 'Time to get out,' Dortis 
Mulkey said, executing the plan perfectly. He reached back and freed the door. 
'I ain't leaving,' Lucille Arp said, pushing back in the imitation velvet 
upholstery. It was gray. It reminded her of the sides of a coffin she had seen 
in the funeral home at Unadilla . . . no telling what was underneath it. 'I'll 
wait here till you get done. . . . Thank God you came. You're going to drive me 
to Unadilla.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'As soon as you get out of the car so we can get it washed, I am.' Dortis 
Mulkey got out of the car and opened the back door. Lucille Arp screamed as 
though cleaved in the middle. Dortis Mulkey leaped back in and drove through 
the car wash, triggering the wash mechanism. It was still churning and 
squirting behind them as they broke into the sunlight and fishtailed around the 
side of the service station onto the highway. 'That's better,' Lucille Arp 
said. 'What you say your name was?' The question evokes painful memories for 
Dortis: of abandonment and ridicule which he had tried all his young life to 
outrun. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Pull over here.' She pointed with an arm that looked like a stick with a 
dead bird nailed to the end of it. 'What for?' 'The call of nature.' Oh God, 
Dortis Mulkey thought. He imagined Lucille Arp stepping out of the car and 
calling and nature responding -- stars sweeping out of the sky as in the Book 
of Revelations, figuring forth the promised upheavals and cataclysms of the 
last days." 
</P>
<P>
Lucille tries to convince Dortis that she has the gift, describing how she had 
helped the high school girls' basketball team win the state championship two 
years in a row by rounding up every cross-eyed girl in town and convincing the 
coach to train them. "Natural-born basketball players. Look here and shoot 
there. Couldn't figure out which way they were going. That's how signs are. 
Look one way and go the other. Took me to tell them or else they'd still be a 
bunch of ugly girls instead of a state championship team bringing back glory." 
</P>
<P>
Dortis Mulkey is by turns, fascinated and repelled. He reveals his dream of 
becoming a professional stock car racer, then his heart hardens again and he 
succeeds in abandoning Lucille at the entrance of a Pizza Heaven. But only 
temporarily. When he returns to fetch her, his encounter with the leathery 
waitress triggers some of the funniest dialogue in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Conversation with Lucille Arp widens Dortis Mulkey's sense of the possible. He 
envisions something vast, a life beyond Unadilla, beyond Macon, miles from the 
mother who walked out because she was too tired to care for him. Lucille and 
Dortis are now convinced that a new beginning awaits them in Florida. "Disney 
World where you can park your car at one of the dwarfs -- Sleepy or Sneezy" but 
the more they struggle, the tighter the net becomes. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of these stories vary from surreal to sad to sensual to sometimes 
wildly funny and the characters are, by turns, murderous, lecherous, righteous, 
and sometimes childishly simple. The thread drawn through all of this is the 
crying need to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, in addition to the Guggenheim fellowships, has won several awards for 
poetry and deservedly so. He has a fine eye for detail and a sharp ear for 
dialogue. He has created people trapped in the skin of old lives; mired in the 
indescribable misery of failed marriages, and we watch as they seek deliverance 
by unlikely routes. They engage in bruising battles with unpeaceful memories 
that gnaw at the core of the self. They cannot outmaneuver them, yet they 
cannot quite come to terms so they keep trying in ways that make these stories, 
rich in the nuance of Southern experience, memorable indeed.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN SEARCH OF J. D. SALINGER BY IAN HAMILTON VINTAGE: $8.95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This biography became something of a cause celebre in 1986, when Salinger 
emerged from two decades of seclusion and attempted to block its publication. 
After a series law suits, Hamilton rewrote the text, shifting the focus to his 
labors as the biographer of an unwilling subject. The result is an arch 
solipsism that attempts to cash in on the continuing popularity of "The Catcher 
in the Rye." 
</P>
<P>
Salinger is so obsessed with protecting his private life that he has committed 
the literary equivalent of seppuku and refused to publish any fiction for 
almost 30 years. In a series of coy dialogues with himself, Hamilton decides 
that Salinger's search for privacy is really a sort of dare to "catch me if you 
can." He can't. He assembles an array of facts about the man's life from 
secondary sources, but his subject eludes him, and there is little, if 
anything, in this book that will enhance the reader's enjoyment of Salinger's 
fiction.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MR. BOFFO: UNCLEAR ON THE CONCEPT BY JOE MARTIN LITTLE, 
BROWN: $6.95 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the drawings are little more than doodles, Martin has developed "Mr. 
Boffo" into a highly entertaining comic strip. His befuddled characters remain 
stranded in a slightly skewed reality; they'd like to join the normal world, 
but they can't seem to get the moves right. Glancing at the desiccated remains 
in a bird cage, Mr. Boffo explains: "At first we called him 'Chirpy' . . . then 
it was 'Wheezy' . . . then 'Sleepy' . . . then 'Smelly' . . . and now for the 
longest time it's been 'Bones.' " Martin's favorite description of his 
characters, "People unclear on the concept," is rapidly becoming a popular 
catch phrase.

"The work startles both in its density of detail and in its overarching 
anticipation of its own self-chosen task. The spectacle of Third World Poverty 
-- its gaudy declaration of need -- is by now surely too familiar a Western 
stereotype to generate any sense of novelty, but Grass' powerful meditation 
explodes the stereotypical in order to address the nature of the cliches in 
which he may be complicit." Sara Suleri

SMART AND LUCKY, BUT HE LOST;

<P>
ADLAI STEVENSON HIS LIFE AND LEGACY BY PORTER MCKEEVER (WILLIAM MORROW: $25; 
544 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Samuel Kernell, Kernell teaches and writes on the presidency at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Counseling the precariously perched politicians of his age, Niccolo Machiavelli 
explained that their success depended upon two qualities: virtu and fortuna, or 
skill and opportunity. These ingredients are no less vital to success today. 
Where politicians must navigate an uncertain world of elections and others' 
ambitions, none can succeed without a fair measure of both. 
</P>
<P>
Some careers, of course, have been more endowed with opportunity than others. 
Walter Mondale bounded up the career ladder by being appointed to fill 
vacancies of unexpired terms. At the other extreme is Lyndon Johnson, who left 
little to chance. But without John Kennedy's death, L.B.J. may never have 
succeeded in throwing off the yoke of being a Southern politician and winning 
the Democratic nomination on his own. The individual doses of virtu and fortuna 
that make each career unique offer a basis for political biography. 
</P>
<P>
This "first one-volume, popular biography of Adlai Stevenson" by friend and 
associate Porter McKeever is less interested in unraveling the forces that 
propelled the career of this unusual politician than in telling one more 
admiring, personal story. This is unfortunate since Stevenson's ascent in 
politics proved, at least to this reader, to be more interesting than his 
private life. It was as though fortuna had to collar Stevenson and cast him 
upon the public stage. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson's initial launching into politics as a gubernatorial candidate in 
Illinois in 1948 followed a pattern repeated four years later in his nomination 
to the presidency. In both instances, he was wooed by party leaders for an 
office he did not seek. What precisely made Stevenson so attractive for the 
governor's race to Chicago boss Jacob Arvey is not altogether clear from the 
facts presented here. Perhaps, being the namesake of a grandfather who served 
as vice president sufficed to make young Adlai candidate material. (We know 
from long-term friend George Ball that Stevenson occasionally entertained such 
thoughts, but more revealing, Ball considered these ruminations idle fantasy.) 
</P>
<P>
President Truman had a more concrete basis for enthusiasm in 1952. Stevenson 
had not joined the loud chorus of Democratic leaders urging Truman to step down 
in 1948. Moreover, he had run ahead of the President in Illinois that year, 
thereby demonstrating his vote-getting potential in an important swing state. 
</P>
<P>
None of these facts would have mattered much, however, had the circumstances 
for Democrats been more favorable. In both instances, Stevenson became the 
choice of leaders who had few alternatives. Their party was facing repudiation 
at the polls, and more seasoned politicians with greater career investments at 
risk had already passed up the "opportunity" to lead the party into near 
certain defeat. Arvey and Truman needed someone who would be willing to make 
the gamble, which meant someone with little to lose. Moreover, these leaders 
sought a candidate from outside their immediate orbit, an individual who would 
not suffer from association with the incumbent Administration. Stevenson 
satisfied both criteria. 
</P>
<P>
One can appreciate his indecisiveness and reluctance. He understood as much as 
anyone the probable outcome in November. "I'll be damned if I want to be a 
caretaker for the party," he declared to a friend. But in the end, of course, 
he accepted the nominations in 1948 and 1952 that more established politicians 
spurned. Whatever his ambivalence, Stevenson could simply not afford to pass up 
these opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Was his upward ascent based solely on circumstance, and once nominated, did he 
serve merely as a sacrificial lamb? No on both counts for the same reason. This 
political neophyte had one extraordinary skill -- the gift of rhetoric -- that 
distinguishes him from other "also rans." Writing his own material, he 
typically spoke with intelligence and inspiration, equal to the best -- and 
more memorable -- efforts of John Kennedy's speech writers. In both 1948 and 
1952, in fact, a speech helped him make a strong first impression on those who 
were asked to nominate a man they did not know. The more famous of the two 
instances, well told here, is the apparently unanticipated, tumultuous response 
to Stevenson's welcoming address at the 1952 Democratic Convention in Chicago. 
After the speech with its 27 interruptions for extended applause and 
demonstrations, most observers on the scene conceded that Stevenson had locked 
up the presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
An equally impressive display of Stevenson's forensic prowess occurred four 
years earlier, when Arvey had him make a few remarks to an assemblage of nearly 
30 state party leaders who controlled the party's gubernatorial nomination. 
Reading from hastily jotted notes, Stevenson delivered his first campaign 
speech. To these "veterans of Illinois' grimy battlefields," he urged reform in 
a manner that would have befitted Oliver Wendell Holmes: 
</P>
<P>
"How else can we insure the survival of our free institutions when the winds 
begin to blow? If the people are cynical, suspicious and abused, if their 
confidence in their heritage is undermined by corruption, greed, excessive 
partisanship, we cannot be sure they will withstand or even identify the 
demagogues and false prophets of a better way who always march in the forefront 
of reaction . . . when the winds blow, and blow they surely will if we stumble 
much further down this path of inflation . . . and corrosive, insensitive 
materialism." 
</P>
<P>
"He's got class," judged one ward committeeman. "We can go with him." Over the 
next decade, a generation of party faithful would hear Stevenson and agree. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Stevenson's singular virtu failed to yield victory. Television 
proved an unfriendly medium: He was clearly uncomfortable in front of the 
camera, and he complained to producers that television made him look like a 
gargoyle. And, of course, standing in his way was Eisenhower, whose formidable 
presence had made it possible for him to receive the party nomination in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
McKeever's sympathetic portrait proceeds at a steady pace. Rarely does it pause 
to reflect. Instead of probing his subject's intellectual development, we are 
presented with perhaps too many excerpts from speeches and magazine articles. 
Similarly, the author makes little attempt to assess Stevenson's widely claimed 
impact on the next generation of Democratic party activists and leaders. A 
quarter of a century after his departure Adlai Stevenson still awaits his 
historical appraisal.

<P>
The best 35,000 words ever put to paper in English? My vote goes to "Heart of 
Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
That is bound to start an argument, but I welcome it as long as those girding 
for battle do one thing: Listen to a good reading of this novella on audio 
cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Even those resistant to the idea of putting classics on tape will be 
transported. 
</P>
<P>
The aural sensation here achieves such an awesome level that you'd swear Joseph 
Conrad sat down in 1901 and wrote this tale to be read into a late 20th-Century 
microphone while a high-tech recording apparatus hummed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through his character Marlow, Conrad says, in effect, "Got a little 
time to kill? Let me tell you a story." 
</P>
<P>
An intimacy is achieved immediately. A great tale is about to be told, and you 
tingle with anticipation as it moves forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Heart of Darkness" fans will recall that as it begins, Marlow, the erstwhile 
seaman and world traveler, is sitting with four chums on a cruising yawl 
anchored in the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
The sun dips, the powerful tide jostles them amid their game of dominoes, and, 
almost apologetically, Marlow drifts into a story about his days as a steamer 
captain on the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
Today, thanks to biographer Norman Sherry and others, there is little mystery 
about how "Heart of Darkness" came about. 
</P>
<P>
A Belgian company hired Conrad in 1890 to pilot a steamboat up the Congo to 
pick up some ivory agents. He made only one trip, so disgusted was he with the 
greed he saw. It is worth thinking about as we in this supposedly more 
civilized time witness the slaughter of the last African elephants. 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'ivory' rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed," wrote Conrad in 
"Heart of Darkness." "You would think they were praying to it. A taint of 
imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! 
I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside, the silent 
wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something 
great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing 
away of this fantastic invasion." 
</P>
<P>
When you hear the late Michael M. Thompson read that part for Recorded Books 
you know you are in the grips of both a great writer and a man whose easy, 
confidential voice is perfect for this story. 
</P>
<P>
You must pay attention, though, because Thompson uses only one voice and it is 
possible to get confused as he switches from the omniscient narrator to Marlow 
to several other characters in the book. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a book for stop-and-go driving. Listen to it on a long drive or 
late at night on a Walkman so that you can savor it and never lose the 
marvelous thread. 
</P>
<P>
Another excellent reading is done by Jack Sondericker for Books in Motion. 
There is no chance of confusion here because Sondericker uses a different voice 
for Marlow, for the Russian who shows up later in the story and for the 
mysterious Mr. Kurtz. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those readings of "Heart of Darkness" can be rented ($9.50 from 
Recorded Books; $7.50 from Books in Motion). The unabridged reading lasts 4 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to own this masterpiece on audio cassette, it is hard to beat 
Norman Barrs' reading for Listening Library. Along with the unabridged "Heart 
of Darkness" you get excerpts from "Lord Jim" and Conrad's great sea tale, 
"Youth." The purchase price is $44.95. 
</P>
<P>
Books on Tape also rents and sells "Heart of Darkness," but I cannot recommend 
their reading by Wolfram Kandinsky .

MALARIA DREAMS AN AFRICAN ADVENTURE BY STUART STEVENS (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: 
$18.95; 236 PP.; 0-87113-278-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dervla Murphy, Murphy's most recent publication is Cameroon With Egbert 
(John Murray, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stuart Stevens is a political consultant who lives in New York and Connecticut 
and contributes to The Washingtonian, The New Republic and Esquire. His first 
book, "Night Train to Turkestan," was described by Beth Henley as 'The best 
travel book I've ever read.' 
</P>
<P>
One evening, in Thailand, a French friend -- Lucien -- suggested to Stevens 
that he might enjoy driving Lucien's new Land Rover back to Paris from Bangui. 
Naturally enough, Stevens had never heard of Bangui. But, when Lucien 
identified it as the capital of the Central African Republic, "To my surprise, 
I realized I had heard of the country. 'Bokassa's empire,' I said. 'The fellow 
who made himself emperor and ate all those schoolchildren.' " 
</P>
<P>
On Page 1 Stevens emerges as ebullient and impetuous, with a disarming line in 
rueful humor. Soon he was flying to Bangui, having chosen Ann, a petite 
23-year-old ex-model, to accompany him on one of the world's most hazardous 
motor routes. 
</P>
<P>
In Bangui Stevens and Ann were cherished by a coffee-planter, Henri -- 
"Lucien's best friend in the CAR." They needed cherishing. A senior government 
official had taken a fancy to the Land Rover which, though blatantly present, 
was not available for the journey to Paris. How had this absurd situation come 
about? Why could it not be altered? To answer those questions here would spoil 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually it became clear that the government official and the Land Rover 
could not be pried apart. Whereupon Stevens and Ann, still determined to drive 
to Europe, trucked into Cameroon to buy a suitable (they hoped) vehicle at a 
reasonable (they hoped) price. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' witty account of arriving late in Yaounde, after a shattering journey, 
and encountering a plethora of surreal problems, is one of the most memorable 
passages in "Malaria Dreams." He soon discovered that, as a vehicle 
sales-point, the Cameroonian capital has its limitations. Seeking, haggling, 
supervising essential repairs and maneuvering through the bureaucracy took a 
very, very long time. Not until Page 114 of this 236-page book does the drive 
to Algiers begin. 
</P>
<P>
When the journey at last begins, the Land Cruiser's bizarre variety of tedious 
mechanical problems provokes a new obsession -- equally uncontrolled. "What I 
liked most about N'Gaoundere were the auto-parts stores" -- Stevens doesn't 
even mention the Lamidat, or the ancient walled market, or the several fine old 
mosques, or the astounding (rather than fine) new mosque. Yet one would have 
expected N'Gaoundere to be of particular interest. As the center of a Fulani 
Emirate, built long before Yaounde appeared, it was among the few pre-colonial 
towns on Stevens' route. 
</P>
<P>
Between Yaounde and Algiers there are, over long stretches, no roads as 
Westerners understand that term. The many foreigners who follow this route -- 
through Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Algeria -- use vehicles that have been 
elaborately adapted in Europe to meet the grim challenge of the Sahara. Stevens 
and Ann were extraordinarily brave (or foolhardy?) to attempt such a journey in 
a Land Cruiser of poignant decrepitude. And they were extremely lucky to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Malaria Dreams" is uneven: sometimes uncommonly well-written and hilariously 
funny but too often -- especially in the second half -- incoherent or banal. 
While crossing one of the remoter regions of West Africa Stevens tells us 
almost nothing about the landscape but records: "With visions of mission 
comforts, we decided to try to reach Tibati that night. . . . Ann had brought 
with her two baseball caps -- one from Notre Dame University (a gift from her 
boyfriend) and the other her red St. Louis Cardinals hat. We debated which 
might have the strongest appeal to a Catholic clergyman." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and Ann frequently camped out, for lack of a mission, but seem to have 
wasted all their opportunities to fraternize with villagers. At one stage 
Stevens' gums bled -- a symptom of scurvy, in an area where everyone eats large 
helpings of Vitamin C-rich greens (jammu-jammu) at least once a day. Did these 
travelers fear the local food? Or did the villagers not offer any because 
"white man" was motoring and therefore apparently self-sufficient? But that 
seems unlikely; most rural Africans are compulsively hospitable to strangers of 
any color or transport-status. 
</P>
<P>
There are significantly few good books about motoring through Africa, where the 
gulf between rural and urban life creates serious psychological as well as 
material problems. Stevens' brilliant vignettes of urban life are completely 
authentic. Anyone who accuses him of exaggeration will be wrong. Yet numerous 
descriptions of African city scenes add up to a misleading impression of that 
continent. For a complex web of reasons -- economic, religious, geographical, 
political -- the spirit of Africa can by now only be contacted in 
bush-villages, far from the nearest town or motor track. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens is culpably vague about the historical background to his journey. His 
reference to West Africa's immemorial tradition of domestic slavery is wildly 
inaccurate. It was a much less vicious institution than he deduces from the 
1851 comments of an ill-informed and politically biased English traveler. Also, 
Cameroon was not divided between the French and English "as a spoil of World 
War I." Having been a German colony, it became two League of Nations Mandated 
Territories. In theory these were not colonies though the French, unlike the 
British, rapidly forgot that fine ethical distinction. Had Stevens given 
himself more than three weeks to do his homework, "Malaria Dreams" might have 
been a much better book.

RAFSANJANI CUTS HARD-LINERS OUT OF IRAN CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani moved abruptly Saturday against hard-line 
opposition, dumping his prime political rival as interior minister and bringing 
in new, moderate faces. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's refusal to retain Ali Akbar Mohtashemi as the minister in charge 
of police and revolutionary committees came in the face of a parliamentary 
petition to keep him on, according to a report of the Iranian national news 
agency monitored here. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that 138 parliamentary deputies, a thin majority of the 
270-member assembly, signed the petition to retain Mohtashemi, a strict 
fundamentalist reputed to have firm ties to the Hezbollah (Party of God) 
movement in Lebanon. Hezbollah factions hold the 14 Western hostages there, 
Western intelligence officials say. There was no indication what, if any, 
effect the change would have on the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout last spring, in the months before the death of Iran's revolutionary 
leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the pragmatic Rafsanjani was locked in 
a rivalry with Mohtashemi and other hard-liners for political power in Iran. 
Passing over the interior minister for reappointment was a bold and potentially 
explosive political move. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani had already engineered a reorganization of government that gave him 
expanded powers in the presidency to which he was elected July 28. The revamped 
structure also eliminated the position of prime minister, held by another 
rival, Hussein Moussavi, who now, like Mohtashemi, is out of a job. Also passed 
over for reappointment was Security and Intelligence Minister Mohammed 
Mohammedi-Reyshahri. 
</P>
<P>
According to the news agency report, the deputies' petition pointed out that 
the "presence of powerful personalities in the future Cabinet is inevitable." 
In advocating Mohtashemi's retention, the petition made note of the 
"sensitivity of the arrogant world" -- the United States -- to developments in 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Moujahedeen opposition, speaking by telephone from Baghdad, 
Iraq, said that the session was stormy, according to the group's reports from 
Tehran. He also said that Iran's new spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, was consulted on only three of Rafsanjani's appointments and that one 
of those was the interior post. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Tehran reports, ministerial appointments will have to be 
confirmed by the Parliament, which took on a more hard-line character in the 
last national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's choice for interior minister, disclosed after the petition was 
read in Parliament, is Abdullah Nouri, who was once Khomeini's representative 
to the Revolutionary Guards, the elite military units charged with defending 
the government. In the late stages of the eight-year war with Iraq, Rafsanjani 
was acting commander of the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Nouri is a representative from Esfahan and a Muslim clergyman, and he headed 
the parliamentary planning and budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than half of the Cabinet ministers were dropped in favor of new 
men. Many of Rafsanjani's choices are technocrats, apparently selected to help 
the new president in his avowed No. 1 priority, reviving the war-devastated 
economy.

SOLIDARITY AIDE NOMINATED AS POLISH PREMIER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Wojciech Jaruzelski on Saturday formally nominated a longtime 
Solidarity adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as Poland's new prime minister, who 
will put together the first non-Communist government in Eastern Europe since 
the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The historic step was announced in a four-paragraph statement issued by the 
Polish news agency and climaxed a swift and incisively orchestrated drive by 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to wrest the government from Communist control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Message to Sejm 
</P>
<P>
"In the nearest future," the announcement said, "the president will table a 
motion to the Sejm (lower house of Parliament) Speaker on the appointment of 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki to the post of premier and entrusting him with the mission 
of forming a government. In the present situation, the president sees a need to 
create a government enjoying the necessary support of parliamentary floor 
groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between Poland's 
political and social forces." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, 62, the editor of Solidarity's weekly newspaper, Tygodnik 
Solidarnosc, has been a member of Solidarity's inner circle of advisers since 
the union was born in the Gdansk shipyards in 1980. Walesa's personal choice 
for the job, Mazowiecki met with Jaruzelski for two hours on Friday and said 
afterward he was ready to accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
His election by the Sejm, probably on Wednesday, is a virtual certainty. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of a new coalition with the United Peasants' Party and the 
Democratic Party, Solidarity controls 264 seats, a majority in the 460-member 
Sejm. With 103 votes between them, the Peasants and the Democrats on Wednesday 
abandoned a 40-year alliance with the Communists, decisively shifting the 
balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, who told reporters Friday that he intended to spend Saturday 
"walking in the woods," spent the day at a school for the blind run by 
Franciscan nuns, where he was briefly interviewed by Polish television. 
</P>
<P>
The economy, he said, is "the greatest problem" for Poland. "I think about it, 
but no one has a miraculous answer. I think the most important thing is that 
people think that things can be better. . . . We are capable of doing very 
much. It is not easy, but it is possible if people feel they are on their own. 
. . . The government has to give the feeling that it is creating possibilities, 
not limiting them." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, a devout Catholic, was one of Solidarity's leading negotiators in 
the lengthy "round-table" negotiations that began last April. Like many of 
Solidarity's leaders, he was imprisoned during the martial-law crackdown 
imposed by Jaruzelski in December, 1981, and was released after one year. He 
immediately returned to his opposition activities. 
</P>
<P>
President Jaruzelski on Saturday also accepted the formal resignation of Prime 
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who offered to step aside on Monday after attempting 
unsuccessfully since his appointment Aug. 2 to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
As the announcement of Mazowiecki's appointment was issued, the Communist 
Party's 230-member Central Committee was meeting in an emergency session to 
formulate a new strategy to deal with a situation that reflected the worst 
fears of party hard-liners, who had fought hard against a yearlong government 
rapprochement with Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners, however, appeared in general retreat, while the party's 
younger and more progressive members lobbied for a proposal that would advocate 
a technocratic government of "experts" free from direct links to political 
parties. It was not a proposal likely to generate much enthusiasm from 
Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for the president, said there is "some 
division" within the Central Committee over the president's action, but 
"generally speaking," there was support for accepting it, since "there is no 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Major Breakthrough' 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's leadership, in its own executive session in Gdansk, issued a 
statement saying the move "should produce a major breakthrough in Polish public 
life by doing away with the present policy of nomenklatura, " the system in 
which party members are appointed to key positions throughout government and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the formation of a Solidarity government appears to spell an end to the 
Leninist principle that insists on the leading role of the Communist Party in 
the affairs of state. The reversal of this cherished Communist idea promises to 
upend power arrangements that have existed in the country since the Communist 
takeover in Poland after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreed upon arrangement, the Communists will retain control of two 
sensitive ministries -- defense and interior -- thus assuring the Soviet Union 
that its security arrangements with Poland remain intact. The Communists also 
expect to play a strong role in foreign affairs, and a bargain may be struck to 
assign a Communist to the position of deputy foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
However, it seems assured that all other ministries will be in the hands of 
Solidarity and its new coalition allies. Solidarity sources say that the United 
Peasants' Party could wind up with four or five ministries and the Democratic 
Party with two. 
</P>
<P>
The key ministries of agriculture, industry, commerce, health, justice, 
transport, communications -- in short, all government departments dealing with 
domestic affairs and economic policy -- are sure to be in the hands of the 
Solidarity coalition. The effects will be sweeping, although, as Solidarity 
activists admit, the changes may be at times confusing, conflicting and perhaps 
even chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Political Reforms 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity has made clear already that it will press ahead with further 
political reforms. Speaking to a parliamentary caucus last week, one deputy 
said that Solidarity can be expected to move as quickly as possible to bring 
state-run television and radio under the supervision of Parliament, thereby 
cutting out Communist control of the electronic media. It is also expected that 
the Communists who have served as spokesmen for the government will be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity has also said it wants to renegotiate the agreements reached with 
the government in April, which called for fully free elections in four years, 
and schedule free elections in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Jaruzelski to accept a Solidarity prime minister and what 
amounts to a Solidarity Cabinet can be taken as the ranking achievement so far 
in the career of Walesa -- a career that clearly has still not reached his 
peak. It is generally assumed that Walesa, when the chance comes, will seek 
election as president of Poland, a possibility that no longer seems remote. 
</P>
<P>
The drive for Solidarity to take the government was Walesa's own idea, one that 
ran counter to the thinking of Solidarity's moderate-leaning brain trust, which 
cautioned that Solidarity is not yet prepared or experienced enough to take 
over a government. 
</P>
<P>
The notion first began to be discussed after Solidarity's triumph in the June 
elections, in which its candidates swept 99 of 100 seats in the new Senate and 
won all 161 seats for which it could compete in the Sejm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Grand Coalition' 
</P>
<P>
The Communists tried unsuccessfully to coax Solidarity into a "grand 
coalition." They watched ("paralyzed like rabbits," in the scolding phrase of 
Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski) while Walesa's lieutenants pried 
loose the Peasants and Democratic parties from the Communist coalition. 
</P>
<P>
After its embarrassing performance in the elections, the Communists' setbacks 
continued. Jaruzelski himself was elected president by the margin of half a 
vote in the Sejm. Gen. Kiszczak's election as prime minister was briefly 
stalled by a premature threat by the Peasants' Party to vote against him. And 
after his election, the threats mounted to vote against any Cabinet he 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Walesa's campaign -- some of it carefully waged behind the 
backs, or over the heads, of some of Solidarity's more conservative advisers -- 
was on the edge of success. The defections of the two minor parties clinched 
it. 
</P>
<P>
A key element, however, was out of Walesa's hands: the acceptance of the idea 
by the Soviet Union. Walesa, early last week, pointedly repeated his assurance 
that Solidarity had no intention of withdrawing Poland from its Warsaw Pact 
security commitments to the Soviet Union. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman 
called the statement "sensible" and went on to say that while the Soviet Union 
was watching Polish events with "concern," it had no intention of interfering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Major Turnaround 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's acceptance of an opposition government in Poland represents a major 
turnaround for the Soviet Union, which has considered Poland a key element (as 
well as a most troublesome one) in the string of East European nations that 
serve as a buffer against the West. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and experienced observers of East European politics believe it is 
inconceivable that Jaruzelski could have taken such a momentous step without 
close consultation with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. And the 
activities last weekend of Soviet Ambassador Vladimir I. Brovikov, who met with 
Kiszczak, the outgoing prime minister, and the heads of the Peasants and 
Democratic parties, suggest that the Soviets were kept closely informed and 
were passing on their own counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The implications, for the rest of Communist Europe, are far reaching. The 
Polish experience gives the green light to Hungary, running second in the 
reform sweepstakes, for similar changes, which could follow elections to be 
held there next year. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, however, is likely to be the country where Communist leaders 
will receive the news with the most shock and alarm. The hard-line Czechoslovak 
leaders have dug in their heels against political reform and give little more 
than lip service on issues of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the regime in Prague has been increasing its pressure on 
opposition activists, common targets of arrest and police harassment. In recent 
days, the leadership has attempted to forestall planned demonstrations Monday 
(in protest of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion) by circulating rumors that police 
may be issued live ammunition to deal with protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line regime in East Germany, which is wedged between Poland and 
affluent, democratic West Germany, also views the momentous changes in Warsaw 
with alarm. Its concern is compounded by the recent flight of large numbers of 
East Germans to the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Pressure 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on Solidarity are enormous, now that it enters a new era, clearly 
transformed from a union-based opposition movement to a political party -- even 
though it has not yet accepted that definition of itself. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity faces its own internal divisions as well, including disputes over 
how fast to move toward a market economy, steps that could cause steep price 
increases and consequent worker demands for compensatory wage hikes. Walesa 
could find himself in a replay of 1981, when he spent much of his time 
crisscrossing the country in the attempt to get strikers to go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the Polish public, and even demanding factory workers, will 
give Solidarity a period of grace, but it is not certain how long the patience 
will last. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible success for our struggle, but let us now see it in 
practice," a delighted Walesa told the Associated Press in a telephone 
interview from Gdansk after Jaruzelski's announcement. "This is just the 
beginning."

At the end of each school year, when his Harvard Law School classmates began 
summer jobs with the country's leading law firms, Hugo Morales returned to the 
fields and picked plums with his family for 25 cents a box. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 14 years after graduating, Morales still has not abandoned the fields 
nor the farm workers he once labored beside. 
</P>
<P>
While many of his former classmates are earning huge salaries in corporate 
America, Morales is making $17,000 a year running a radio station for farm 
workers. Radio Bilingue, a nonprofit FM station Morales founded, is broadcast, 
engineered and managed almost entirely by current and former farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I went away to school to learn skills so I could one day return and help my 
people," said Morales, who grew up in a Sonoma County labor camp. "I felt it 
was important to come back every summer and work in the fields so I never lost 
that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heard in Fields 
</P>
<P>
Drive along U.S. 99, through the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, and Radio 
Bilingue can be heard wherever people are working in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, a radio slung on a post blares Mexican folk music to grape 
pickers in Bakersfield. After lunch, cotton field workers near Tulare listen to 
a Spanish language talk show hosted by a former farm worker. In the late 
afternoon, a car radio blasts "Tex-Mex" music to plum and nectarine pickers 
near Fresno. After work, in a Madera labor camp, farm workers listen to a 
Spanish language news show. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a farm worker radio station became apparent to Morales when he was 
working in the fields with his family. Years later he decided to create a 
station that would entertain farm workers in the fields and also provide news 
and information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farm Workers' Interests 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up, many people figured farm workers were stupid and 
couldn't possibly have any interest in civic issues," he said. "But as a kid I 
heard the workers talk about the contributions they made to their villages in 
Mexico. They had served as mayors and had built schools. They had brought in 
telephone lines and built roads. 
</P>
<P>
"But in America it was like they didn't exist. I wanted to give them a window 
to the outside world through the radio station . . . a way to contribute to 
their own communities and a way to link up with the world outside." 
</P>
<P>
When Morales founded the station nine years ago he immediately began featuring, 
in addition to music, public affairs shows focusing on farm-worker issues. The 
station broadcast forums and call-in shows on issues such as immigration 
reform, pesticides, labor law and bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the Fresno station has been reaching out to a national audience. The 
daily Spanish-language news show produced by the station -- "Noticiero Latino" 
-- is now broadcast by satellite and nationally syndicated. The station created 
a series on refugees and immigrants, funded by a Ford Foundation grant, that 
was broadcast by more than 300 stations. And this fall Radio Bilingue will 
produce a nationally distributed series on the problems faced by immigrant 
children in schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Purpose 
</P>
<P>
Although the station has gained much attention for its news shows, the variety 
of Mexican music that farm workers listen to in the fields also serves an 
important purpose, Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many farm workers are made to feel that they have no culture of their own. But 
when they hear the many types of music from Mexico on the radio, they realize 
it is worthwhile. They know their music and heritage is something to be proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Mejia first heard Radio Bilingue while digging an irrigation ditch two 
years ago. He keeps a transistor radio hitched to his belt when he works, and 
he flipped through the stations until he heard a Radio Bilingue music show. He 
listened to the station every day for the next few months, and when he heard a 
broadcaster ask for volunteers, he decided to call the station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hosts Music Show 
</P>
<P>
Now every Wednesday night, after working 10 hours in the fields, he hosts a 
show featuring contemporary Mexican music. Between songs he reads public 
service announcements and, he said, gives frequent advice "to my neighbors so 
they have a better life." Register to vote, he tells them; take an interest in 
your children's education; contribute to your community. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only been to school for one year, so I never dreamed I'd be speaking to 
so many people from the radio," said Mejia in heavily accented English. "There 
is a lot of injustice. . . . Many people live in terrible conditions. It's 
important that we all do what we can to help each other have better lives. This 
is my way." 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Espinoza, a former farm worker, hosts a call-in show twice a week. On a 
recent afternoon, his guest was an attorney from California Rural Legal 
Assistance who answered questions and gave legal advice to callers. A 
50-year-old woman from Fresno said she could not get a job in the fields 
because of her age. An orchard worker from Madera reported that a grower who 
still owed him money had just sold his ranch. A farm worker from Reedley 
complained about a large ranch without adequate bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the callers were intimidated at first, so Espinoza casually chatted 
with them before turning them over to the attorney. Espinoza has an informal 
style and uses the name "Primo" (cousin) on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these callers are afraid to go into an office and complain about 
mistreatment," Espinoza said. "They might not feel comfortable talking to some 
guy with a necktie. But after they talk to me they become more at ease. . . . I 
was a farm worker until I was 28 years old. I don't use 50-cent words. I speak 
the language of the barrio." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Morales still has strong ties to the fields. His father works in a 
vineyard; his mother works in a fruit cannery. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a diminutive, soft-spoken man with wire spectacles, has the manner of 
an aging graduate student. But because he has worked at the same backbreaking 
jobs as the farm workers he broadcasts to, he knows the music they want to hear 
and the type of news that interests them. 
</P>
<P>
He began raising funds for the radio station shortly after he graduated from 
law school. He worked for the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, and 
later as a professor at Fresno State University, but he decided that through 
radio he could have the greatest impact on farm workers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think the commercial Hispanic media was doing a very good job," he 
said. "The news was generally a translation of mainstream news that had little 
relevance to the lives of farm workers. Many of the stations were owned by 
whites who weren't interested in the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
Morales decided to offer people an alternative to commercial radio by starting 
a public radio station. He began by creating hand-lettered signs with crude 
drawings of radio transmitters, requesting volunteers. He held dances and 
"menudos" -- fund-raisers featuring the popular Mexican dish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Resistance 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of resistance at first," Morales recalled. "People would ask 
me: 'Who's going to put on all these shows?' I'd answer: 'You are.' But the 
common Joe couldn't conceive of it. They thought you had to be some 
well-trained golden voice to do it." 
</P>
<P>
After three years, he was only able to raise $1,500, and he was considering 
abandoning his dream. But in 1979, a Catholic charity gave him a $166,000 
grant. Soon, other foundations followed, and on July 4, 1980, Radio Bilingue 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
"That first day was incredibly emotional. People were calling the station, 
crying, so moved that something like this could happen. . . . I drove all the 
way to Modesto to see how far the signal reached and all the way there I could 
hear the station being played in the fields. It was a wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the shows were in Spanish, Morales wanted to attract 
English-speaking Latinos in the Fresno area and "to bring these communities 
together." The station broadcasts a few programs in English, such as the Latin 
jazz and salsa shows. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Bilingue, which is broadcast from the seventh floor of a downtown Fresno 
office building, recently added transmitters in Bakersfield and El Centro. Now 
the station can be heard throughout the San Joaquin Valley, the Imperial Valley 
and over the border in Mexico. But the paid staff is still small, and the 
station is run largely by volunteers, most of whom are farm workers. Because of 
cutbacks in state funding, Morales said, the station, which is now supported 
mainly by grants and donations, is perpetually in debt. 
</P>
<P>
The donations usually are small, money orders rather than checks, five or 10 
hard-earned dollars saved from a farm worker's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a Mixtec Indian, left Oaxaca, Mexico, when he was 9 years old and 
moved with his family to a Sonoma County farm labor camp. His family of six 
lived in a rickety, two-room house with no insulation, heat or indoor plumbing. 
Morales worked in the fields during the summer and after school with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
His father had been a community organizer in Mexico, and both parents stressed 
the value of education. All four children graduated from college, but Morales 
was a particularly good student and received a full scholarship to Harvard. His 
yearly academic expenses exceeded his mother and father's combined annual 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Every summer, during his seven years at Harvard, Morales returned home. He 
picked prunes, dropped them into buckets and sorted them into boxes. He picked 
apples, grapes and strawberries. He drove a tractor and forklift. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back every summer was important, but it also helped me. Harvard was a 
lonely place. I felt very alienated. I enjoyed coming home and being part of 
the community again . . . living and working with my family and going to church 
with everyone on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
People from humble backgrounds who have succeeded, Morales said, are often used 
by "Reagan-type Republicans" to justify cutting programs to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Totally Wrong' 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the best will always rise, regardless of their circumstances, is 
totally wrong," he said. "I'm the rare exception. The vast majority of kids 
with my background still have no future. There's a desperate need for organized 
programs to assist the poor. You can't rely on a few exceptions to justify 
denying help to the many who need it." 
</P>
<P>
Morales, who is single, frequently works 60-hour weeks, spending his days at 
Radio Bilingue and his nights working with various Fresno organizations that 
aid the poor. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, after another long day at the radio station, he drove the 
back roads of the San Joaquin Valley, through small towns where farm workers 
lounged on lawns and porches, listening to Radio Bilingue on hot summer nights. 
Morales occasionally slowed down to study the ramshackle apartments and labor 
camps where his listeners live. 
</P>
<P>
"Just seeing people living like this gives meaning to what I'm doing," he said 
softly, engine idling beside a row of wooden shacks. "These are the people we 
are trying to serve. These are the people who need our station."

MAMMOTH LAKES FACES A NEW ERA; 
</P>

SIERRA GETAWAY LEARNING TO HANDLE URBAN WOES, POLITICS, REDEVELOPMENT

MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many tourists who come for the fishing, mountain bike trails and High 
Sierra scenery, summer in Mammoth has an idyllic appeal that lasts until the 
first snow brings skiers speeding up the highway from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But the resort and its 4,000 year-round residents have been confronted this 
summer with evidence that Mammoth Lakes, the first incorporated town in 
mountainous Mono County, is no longer an escape from the pressures that 
complicate life in American cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Times Change 
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, local headlines have screamed about a drug ring that 
kidnaped and tried to murder a police source. Trees and meadows will soon give 
way to three new large developments, including the eastern Sierra's first urban 
redevelopment project. And, less than five years since it was formed, the Town 
Council faces a recall led by disgruntled businessmen and the former mayor. 
</P>
<P>
All might be common occurrences in other California towns and cities, but in 
Mammoth Lakes they are signs of new times and, to some, a new order. Once a 
small community of motels and steak houses at the foot of a promising ski 
mountain, the Mammoth Ski Area has burgeoned into one of America's largest and 
the town has grown with it. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate boom, the first since a volcano threat in 1983 that spurred a 
local recession, is bringing more year-round residents, pushing Mammoth further 
over the edge from resort to modern American town. The community calendar still 
includes regular meetings of High Sierra Fly Fishers and volunteer 
firefighters. But there are also weekly sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous, Adult 
Children of Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous. A rape crisis center is 
scheduled to open soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't find a married couple with kids when I moved up here," said Wally 
Hoffman, publisher and editor of the Mammoth Times, the more colorful of two 
weekly newspapers in town. Now the schools are filling up. 
</P>
<P>
The most telling sign is not the crime wave, which by urban standards was small 
and short-lived. Mammoth Lakes police cracked a drug ring and arrested 23 
people, including three women charged with trying to beat to death another 
woman they suspected of working with police. 
</P>
<P>
More explanatory of the upheaval in Mammoth is the effort to recall the Town 
Council. Officially, recall leaders complain that the town pays its help too 
much and doesn't listen to the people. But many people here agree a changing of 
the guard is behind the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became More Sophisticated 
</P>
<P>
"There was a good ol' boy mentality that has been here forever," said John 
Eastman, a Town Council member. "The community demanded a higher level of 
sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was a move this spring by the Town Council and an aggressive 
new town manager, Paul Marangella, to stop giving a portion of the 9% tax on 
condo and motel rentals to a group of local business people. The group is 
supposed to use the money to promote Mammoth in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Around town some feel the group, the Mammoth Lakes Resort Assn., has done its 
job well. "The MLRA was designed to bring visitors here," former Mayor Boyd 
Lemmon says. "We are getting substantially more summer business." 
</P>
<P>
But others are leery. Three years ago an association executive embezzled more 
than $100,000 and was sent to state prison. There is no hint of theft now, but 
the Town Council decided there must be a better way to lure tourists than 
letting the resort association spend more than $600,000 a year of town taxes on 
advertising and promotion. "We can't continue to be unsophisticated," said Town 
Councilman Kirk Stapp, a high school government teacher. "We're in competition 
with Colorado and other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Led by Marangella, town officials also questioned the group's practices, which 
include using some of the tax money to finance a telephone service that refers 
skiers to selected motels and condos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Straw 
</P>
<P>
The resort association challenge was the last straw for business people who 
dislike the changes in Mammoth Town Hall. "They want to control that money," 
said Tom Cage, owner of Village Sports Center and a recall leader. "We 
incorporated this town for the people, not for bigger government." 
</P>
<P>
Some animosity stems from the council's hiring last fall of Marangella, the 
stocky, intense town manager. He has angered Mammoth old-timers in a variety of 
ways, from calling for an end to the town's policy of free child care and 
proposing a fee for tennis court reservations, to getting free snow boots as 
part of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how disruptive he has been in this community. It's 
unbelievable," said Lemmon, who was mayor until he resigned from the council in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Marangella's most controversial step may have been a written report that 
alleged the Mono County Grand Jury might investigate threats of retaliation by 
disgruntled resort association members. "The message -- perhaps unintended -- 
was 'if you mess with us, we will break you politically,' " Marangella said in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
But Marangella has also brought a professional edge to the town offices, a side 
that was sorely lacking, according to his defenders on the Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked for aggressive city management," said Mayor Gary Flynn, a longtime 
Long Beach resident who came to Mammoth to publish a magazine. "We got it." 
Said Councilman Stapp: "In the nine months that he has been here, we've 
probably accomplished three years of business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Charge 
</P>
<P>
Marangella, who came to Mammoth from the Bay Area city of El Cerrito, 
acknowledges stepping on toes and shaking up things, but says Mammoth Lakes 
needed to mature as a town. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration was in total disarray," he said. "There's a little 
different value system now at the town offices. We don't accept gifts . . . 
we're not doing things in the back rooms." 
</P>
<P>
He took over just as Mammoth Lakes was finally rebounding from the economic 
effects of a 1983 U.S. Geological Survey warning that a swarm of earthquakes in 
the eastern Sierra might presage a volcanic eruption near Mammoth. Cinder cones 
and steam vents found all over the area indicate a high level of geologic 
activity, so the alarm was not a total surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Property values plummeted after the volcano warning. But a year later, after 
frenzied lobbying by residents and developers, top U.S. Geological Survey 
officials said the threat was overstated. Volcanoes are still not a subject 
spoken of often locally, and the evacuation road that was judiciously carved 
through a forest is known simply as the Mammoth Lakes "scenic loop." 
</P>
<P>
Now town officials have begun plans to change what one calls "the texture of 
the community," encouraging the first luxury hotels and pedestrian villages 
with shopping and restaurants for skiers. There is also talk of building a 
conference center and expanding the airport. The airport is served by a 
commuter line, Alpha Air, but it has only one runway and cannot accommodate 
jets or strong crosswinds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects Under Way 
</P>
<P>
On a meadow south of town, the area's first golf course, plus a hotel and 
skiers village are now under construction. The developer, Tom Dempsey, is a 
former ski instructor at Mammoth Mountain who has built hundreds of Mammoth's 
condos. Controversial plans to include a new ski area, called Sherwin Bowl, 
have yet to receive U.S. Forest Service approval. 
</P>
<P>
The town's redevelopment project would be a joint effort of Dempsey and Mammoth 
Mountain to extend a ski lift into the north village area of Mammoth Lakes and 
add another hotel. The third big project, still in discussions, would be built 
in the undeveloped center of town and would also bring a new, luxury-class 
hotel to a town better known for ski condos and older motel-style lodges. 
</P>
<P>
By providing more amenities to skiers and summer tourists, locals hope to give 
themselves a hedge against the hard times inevitable in a mountain resort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough town to survive in," said Mayor Flynn. "Living costs are high. 
Winters can be harsh. You're totally dependent on the weather, because if 
there's no snow there won't be any customers." 
</P>

VIET WRITER ONCE FRIENDLY TO REDS IS SHOT IN FRESNO

An internationally known Vietnamese writer who sympathized with the Communists 
before the fall of South Vietnam but later was imprisoned by the North 
Vietnamese was shot and seriously injured here Saturday while walking along a 
residential street near his home, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Oliver Moon said witnesses reported that Doan Van Toai was 
wounded from shots fired at 9 a.m. by two Asian men in a "dirty" brown Pontiac 
station wagon. Toai was hit three times and underwent surgery at an undisclosed 
hospital, said Moon. He was listed in serious condition and by late Saturday 
still had not been able to talk to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Known Motive 
</P>
<P>
Moon said there was no known motive for the attack. Until detectives are able 
to question Toai they will not know if the shooting has any connection to other 
assaults in recent months aimed at prominent Vietnamese who advocated closer 
ties with Vietnam, such as travel and establishment of diplomatic relations. 
Several such incidents have occurred in Orange and Los Angeles counties, home 
to large Vietnamese immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
Phuong Tran, president of the Vietnamese Committee for Human Rights in 
Washington, who said she has known Toai for more than 15 years told the 
Associated Press, "A lot of Vietnamese accuse him of being a communist agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of him as a Vietnamese who tried to do something good for the people 
of Vietnam and for the good of the country itself," she said. "That doesn't 
mean he agreed with the present political situation in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Toai, 42, came to the United States in 1978 after being released from a 
Vietnamese "re-education camp." 
</P>
<P>
He co-authored two books "The Vietnamese Gulag" and "Portrait of the Enemy" 
with writer David Chanoff. "The Vietnamese Gulag," published in 1979, was a 
best-seller in France and in 1986 was published in the United States, making 
Toai one of the few Vietnamese authors able to attract a non-specialist 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backed Ho's Cause 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Mekong Delta in 1945, the same year Ho Chi Minh began his campaign 
to free Vietnam from French colonialism, Toai grew up following the politics of 
his family, including his village school teacher-father, in backing Ho's cause. 
He said he wanted an independent Vietnam, but like many southerners, was wary 
of Northern Vietnamese, fearing that given the chance, they would take all 
power to themselves and dominate the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Toai said he strongly supported the Hanoi-backed National Liberation Front but 
never actually joined the organization. Instead, he became branch manager of a 
bank in the central coastal city of Qui Nhon and carried out secret financial 
transactions for the NLF. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after South Vietnam fell to the north in April, 1975, Toai returned 
to Saigon seeking, but failing to find, a way to leave the country. Instead he 
became a member of the finance committee of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Government, which held power before the unification of the country under the 
government in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
After a dispute over Hanoi's increasing refusal to give power to southerners, 
Toai was imprisoned for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View of Communism 
</P>
<P>
As he later said: "Communism does well in repelling foreign invasion, but does 
not bring the good society." 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving in the United States, Toai supported his family through his 
writings, as a visiting research associate for the UC Berkeley's Institute of 
East Asian Studies .

Gunmen dressed as tourists, down to the wearing of shorts and the carrying of 
cameras, shot dead a Palestinian stone thrower and wounded three others 
Saturday, Arab witnesses said. The incident appears to be the latest chapter of 
a covert war where participants in the Arab uprising are assassinated on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the body of an American-Palestinian was found in a field near the 
West Bank town of Al Birah, the apparent victim of torture and a shooting, 
family members said. The U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem has asked for an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Bethlehem said that between six and eight gunmen, who were seen 
carrying knapsacks and tourist maps, loitered near St. Mary's Syrian Church at 
the top of a staircase that leads down to Manger Square, the traditional site 
of Jesus' birth. 
</P>
<P>
As happens almost every morning, masked youths and young men taunted soldiers 
who were stationed below until the troops began an armed pursuit. As one such 
group threw stones at approaching soldiers, at least two gunmen pulled 
revolvers, shooting one stone-thrower in the chest and three in the legs. The 
dead victim, Radi Mahmoud Salah, was from the village of Dar Salah on the 
outskirts of Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents have used a 
series of disguises -- from Arab dress to journalistic credentials and 
apparently now tourist garb -- in order to close in on Palestinian protesters 
and stone throwers. 
</P>
<P>
The use of civilian dress by Israeli soldiers and the Shin Bet security service 
and the stalking of Palestinian rebels have brought up uncomfortable parallels 
with tactics common to so-called dirty wars in countries like Argentina and El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shot Them in Cold Blood' 
</P>
<P>
"I could not believe my eyes," said a druggist who witnessed the shooting in 
Bethlehem. "They grabbed them and shot them in cold blood." 
</P>
<P>
Residents viewed the use of such cover as endangering foreigners in Bethlehem, 
a place where the Arab uprising and pilgrimage have been carried on side by 
side. Leaders of the uprising had told their followers to avoid throwing rocks 
at tourist buses entering the city or parked in Manger Square. 
</P>
<P>
"We like tourists here. We never bother them," said a bread salesman who also 
witnessed the killing. "But now, we must suspect them, too." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, an eight-year-old pointed aggressively at two unwary tourists from 
Bethlehem, each carrying a camera, and yelled in English: "No good, no good." 
An army spokesmen said only that the stone throwers were shot by security 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arab-American Slain 
</P>
<P>
The shootings in Bethlehem coincided with the grisly discovery of the body of 
14-year-old Amjad Hussein Jibreen in Al Birah, north of Jerusalem. Jibreen, who 
was born in Denver and maintained American citizenship, was shot in the chest, 
and his body showed signs of a beating and cigarette burns, family members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Al Birah say the boy was last seen leaving a mosque in Ramallah 
last Wednesday, two days after youths in the city threw firebombs at a car 
carrying four Israeli tax collectors. Two of the passengers were badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said they were told that the boy was held by the army. The army 
spokesmen denied it. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee demanded an investigation 
into the killing of Jibreen. 
</P>
<P>
Jibreen's cousin, Ayman, said the body was discovered Saturday morning by a 
shepherd in the hills near Al Birah and was quickly buried. 
</P>
<P>
Ayman said he saw the body after it was discovered and that it appeared that 
his cousin was shot at close range. "There were burns on his body, some of his 
teeth were knocked out, and there was a bullet in his chest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amjad Jibreen moved to his mother's hometown of Al Birah in 1983. His father, 
Wathak, lives in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discovery Sparks Rioting 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the body set off rioting in Al Birah, and the army sealed off 
the town. Troops also piled sand high on the road to the Jibreen household to 
keep reporters and mourners away. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers during the 
20-month uprising. Palestinians have killed another 80 of their own people 
suspected of collaborating with Israel. Thirty-five Israelis and two foreigners 
have died at the hands of Palestinians.

HEZBOLLAH HINTS AT NEW ATTACKS ON U.S. TARGETS

The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah on Saturday accused the United States, France 
and Pope John Paul II of favoring Lebanese Christians over Muslims and hinted 
that new attacks may be mounted on U.S. targets. 
</P>
<P>
Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's main Lebanese ally, ordered a general 
mobilization in his 200,000-member Druze community to prepare for a major 
battle against the Christians, Muslim sources said. The Druze are an offshoot 
sect of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two people were killed and nine were wounded in clashes between 
Syrian troops and Christian forces along Beirut's Christian-Muslim dividing 
line and three other fronts in the central Lebanese mountains and in the north. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Toll Now at 781 
</P>
<P>
The new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and 2,118 wounded 
since fighting broke out March 8 between Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly 
Christian army units and Syrian troops backed by Jumblatt's Progressive 
Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since the U.N. 
Security Council appealed Tuesday for a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement published by Beirut newspapers, Hezbollah, or Party of God, 
accused France, the United States and the Pope of favoring Lebanese Christians 
in the 14-year-old civil war with Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"The French naval buildup in the Mediterranean, the Pope's fanatic and biased 
stands, and America's moves at the (U.N.) Security Council are part of the 
arrogant campaign aimed at taming the Muslims," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the Crusaders' 
invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of martyrdom that forced 
the (U.S.) Marines and the French to retreat in 1983," it said. 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks on Oct. 23, 1983, 
against the U.S. Marine base and the headquarters of French paratroopers in 
Beirut. The bombings killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers and 
led to withdrawal of an international peace force. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for terrorists holding 14 Western 
hostages, including eight Americans, in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
French Warships Dispatched 
</P>
<P>
France dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch, the destroyer Cassard, and the 
destroyer Duquesne to the Mediterranean in recent days while its envoy, Alain 
Decaux, discussed the crisis with Lebanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, who serves as army commander and leader of a Christian Cabinet, was 
quoted Saturday as saying that he would like to see French forces get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like a French military intervention, but I don't want to compromise 
France with a Lebanese request. Up until now, we have exhausted much of our 
human and material resources, and we need help to continue the resistance," 
Aoun was quoted in an interview in the Paris weekly Journal du Dimanche. 
</P>
<P>
French officials say the movement of their forces in the Mediterranean was 
designed to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French citizens if necessary. 
They say Paris has no intention of intervening militarily.

Hungary's ruling Communist Party blamed itself Saturday for the current 
national crisis and resolved to turn into a humane socialist party committed to 
a mixed market economy and a welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
"State socialism has brought Hungary into a critical situation," the Hungarian 
Socialist Workers' Party (HSWP) said in a lengthy draft policy program 
published in the Party daily Nepszabadsag. 
</P>
<P>
"The HSWP dissociates itself from all versions of Stalinism but at the same 
time feels responsible for the crisis and considers it its duty to take a part 
in overcoming it," it said. 
</P>
<P>
With Poland, Hungary has been in the forefront of the reformist wave sweeping 
across Eastern Europe, to the dismay of hard-liners, notably in Czechoslovakia 
and East Germany.

Historic change and daunting challenges in Poland were bannered in the Western 
press Saturday but given decidedly less coverage in the East Bloc. A smiling 
Pope John Paul II called the developments in his homeland "a step forward." 
</P>
<P>
"All that has been done is very important," the pontiff, visiting Spain, said 
of the nomination of his friend, Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as 
prime minister. "It's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Coverage in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria was restrained. In 
Romania, where the government has been hostile to liberalization in Poland, the 
events were not reported at all. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet newspapers carried a report from the official Tass news agency 
quoting Polish Communist leaders as complaining about the "confrontational 
actions of the leaders of the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few commentaries to appear in Soviet papers was in Moskovskaya 
Pravda, where East European specialist Mikhail Tretyakov stressed the dangers 
of letting Poland's government crisis drag on. 
</P>
<P>
"The prolonging of the process of forming the government does not further 
social consolidation, the establishment of order and the removal of the country 
from its state of crisis," Tretyakov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency took a more positive approach: "Government 
crisis enters calmer waters," it said. Reports in the Hungarian news media also 
were supportive. 
</P>
<P>
China's official New China News Agency carried factual reports but no 
commentary on the developments in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Poland was the lead story in most French papers Saturday, with the pointed 
exception of the Communist Party's L'Humanite, which put its report on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the leftist Liberation newspaper said that "the choice of a 
prime minister from Solidarity's ranks is beyond any possible contest one of 
the most important events since Yalta. But the road leading Poland to democracy 
remains long." 
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro, in an editorial, said a Solidarity-led government "will have only a 
short honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
Some Italian newspapers played up the role of Poland's Roman Catholic Church. 
"Close Follower of the Pope Will Be Premier in Warsaw," said the headline in 
the Communist Party daily L'Unita. 
</P>
<P>
In a commentary in Corriere Della Sera of Milan, Arrigo Levi said the "rules of 
behavior" under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are now more evident. 
</P>
<P>
"But much remains unknown: do these rules really apply for all the countries of 
Eastern Europe . . . not only for Hungary, but also for Czechoslovakia? . . . 
And for East Germany? In reality, we don't know," Levi said.

AZERBAIJANIS PACK CAPITAL IN PROTEST MARCH

Hundreds of thousands of people, some holding banners proclaiming "Down with 
Russian dictatorship!" on Saturday packed the central square of Baku, capital 
of the Azerbaijan republic, protest organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering was called by the unofficial Azerbaijani Popular Front to back 
its demands for greater local autonomy and continued control of the disputed 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
Popular Front spokesman Nazim Ragimov told Reuters by telephone from Baku that 
at least 600,000 people took part in the protest. No independent crowd estimate 
was available. 
</P>
<P>
Ragimov said the gathering was much larger than a similar protest in Baku's 
Lenin Square last Monday at the end of a one-day strike. An estimated 150,000 
people took part in that demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Ragimov said talks between the Popular Front and the Azerbaijani leadership had 
achieved nothing. "They are not prepared to agree to any one of our demands." 
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front has threatened to call a general strike across the republic 
unless the authorities support their calls for greater political and economic 
autonomy and the recall of parliamentary deputies they say are 
unrepresentative. 
</P>
<P>
They are also demanding an end to Moscow's direct control over 
Nagorno-Karabakh, imposed last year after clashes between Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians, and the end to a curfew and military presence in Baku and other 
Azerbaijani towns. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani authorities, while agreeing to talk to the group's leaders, 
have refused to formally recognize the movement.

Rep. Mickey Leland was eulogized Saturday as a martyr for the cause of world 
hunger, and mourners were urged to honor his memory by carrying on his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Mickey is gone, but his values and his work will live after him in our memory 
and in our commitment," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said at a 
funeral Mass at St. Anne's Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the world, there are voices -- tens of thousands, perhaps millions, now 
and in the future -- who will live longer, will live better, will have hope 
because of the efforts of this man," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
Leland, 44, was killed with 15 others on Aug. 7 when their plane crashed in 
Ethiopia while carrying them to a camp for Sudanese refugees. A private burial 
is planned for the six-term congressman when his remains are returned to 
Houston, probably some time this week, family friends said. He is to be buried, 
as he had requested, in a simple pine coffin, which rested before the altar for 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended by Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Leland's mourners were white, black, Asian and Latino. Some, such as Atlanta 
Mayor Andrew Young and Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards, were easily 
recognized. Others less famous were Leland's neighbors in Houston's 
impoverished Fifth Ward, where Leland grew up and later represented in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people crowded under the ornately carved arches of the central 
Houston church Saturday and hundreds more gathered outside as politicians and 
clergymen praised Leland's work on behalf of the starving in Africa and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Leland's wife, Alison, and other family members attended the service, along 
with numerous dignitaries. The Mass followed Friday's memorial service, which 
drew 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vatican Message 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Joseph Fiorenza of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston read a message 
delivered through the Vatican Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, the message said, "is well aware of Rep. Leland's great 
humanitarian effort to relieve the starvation of the Sudanese refugees in 
Ethiopia. His holiness is likewise grateful that his admirable concern helped 
to bring the plight of these unfortunate people to the world's attention." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke forcefully during a service that mixed the 
elements of a traditional Roman Catholic Mass with jubilant gospel singing and 
the jazzy strains of a saxophone and electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beloved Member' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, (D-Berkeley) said Leland was a "beloved member" of a 
small family -- the Congressional Black Caucus -- and spoke solemnly of its 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Along with Mickey we lived in a world of words. Where words have great 
significance, where words have great power, where words even have the 
implications of life and death," Dellums said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, at this moment, words are so incredibly inadequate to communicate to all 
of you here this incredible loss for an extraordinary member of our family."

An explosion ripped open a Manhattan street Saturday, spewing steam high into 
the air, killing two people, injuring at least 26 others and prompting the 
evacuation of hundreds of residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole street is broken up and there is steam pouring into the sky like a 
geyser in a national park," Fire Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast on 20th Street near Third Avenue apparently occurred when underground 
pipes carrying steam to buildings broke, Consolidated Edison Co. spokesman 
Martin Gitten said. Con Ed workers had been working on a steam line. 
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman who suffered multiple injuries were pronounced dead at 
Bellevue Hospital Center, a spokesman said. No other details on the dead were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Officials evacuated people from an 18-story apartment building next to the 
explosion site in the exclusive Gramercy Park neighborhood. Broken windows 
could be seen at least 11 stories up.

Matthew Horeczko threw himself a party at his parents' home in San Pedro on 
Thursday, the night before he was to leave for his first year in college. Wade 
Hashimoto of Torrance was one of at least 150 teen-agers who came from all 
around the South Bay to enjoy the end-of-summer bash. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the gathering in a normally placid middle-class section of 
the community overlooking Los Angeles Harbor, Hashimoto was dead, Horeczko was 
in jail on suspicion of his murder and two other youths were recovering from 
stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Police, relatives and friends said Saturday they were still trying to 
understand how two seemingly nonviolent, wholesome boys would become involved 
in such a bloody confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Out of Town 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective James Vena said Horeczko's parents were 
out of town the night of the party in the 1800 block of Chandeleur Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said accounts vary as to whether the party was supposed to be by 
invitation only but, regardless, young people arrived from all over. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said the party was real fun and there were no problems until the very 
end," Vena said. 
</P>
<P>
At a little after 10 p.m., someone turned off the blaring music and announced 
on a disc-jockey's microphone that everyone should go home, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
But some guests who arrived late did not want to leave and congregated in front 
of the house, said William Steel, who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
A series of fights broke out and then a few teen-agers began throwing bottles 
and debris at the house, Vena said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a war zone to me," Steel said. "There was pandemonium in the 
streets . . . fist fights and kids running in all directions." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Vena declined to provide details about the attack on Hashimoto, 19, 
saying only that he was standing in front of the house when he was stabbed in 
the chest by Horeczko, 18. Hashimoto died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Are Wounded 
</P>
<P>
Two other 19-year-olds, Derek Gray of Hawthorne and Jose Romero of Carson, also 
were stabbed and taken to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, Vena said. The 
detective declined to say whether Horeczko is suspected of those attacks. Gray 
was treated and released and Romero was in good condition at the hospital 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said that Horeczko told investigators that he stabbed Hashimoto in self 
defense. The case will be presented to the district attorney's office Monday or 
Tuesday, Vena said. 
</P>
<P>
Horeczko and Hashimoto, who apparently did not know each other, were both 
described as amiable, athletic young men. 
</P>
<P>
Horeczko was an all-league fullback and defensive back last fall at Mary Star 
of the Sea High School in San Pedro, according to his coach, Jerry Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot, 11-inch, 185-pound Horeczko was due to report today for his first 
football practice at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also played football before graduating from Torrance High School in 
1988. His parents said Saturday that he had been working part-time as a pizza 
deliveryman and preparing next month to begin his second year at El Camino 
College in Torrance, where he studied business. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 5 feet, 8 inches and 160 pounds, liked to go out with his friends 
but never got into trouble, his mother said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved to go out to parties. We always cautioned him to be careful," said 
Carol Hashimoto, a school teacher. But she said Wade told her not to worry, 
saying: "Everybody likes to go out and see their friends. It's fun."

A REAL MULTI-MEDIA KIND OF GUY;

<P>
DAVID LYNCH, ARTIST IN MANY FORMS, TELLS HIS TALES OF HOLLYWOOD AFTER 'BLUE 
VELVET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the film "Blue Velvet" hit movie theaters three years ago, it was clear 
that director David Lynch was a cinematic visionary in full bloom. The story of 
a young man in small-town America who stumbles onto a mystery that leads him to 
discover forbidden sexual knowledge of himself, the modestly budgeted ($6 
million) film was hailed as a masterpiece and garnered a best director Oscar 
nomination for Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed safe to assume that the Hollywood money men would beat a path to his 
door, and Lynch was indeed courted by all the usual suspects -- he has come 
close to making more than half a dozen films since "Blue Velvet" elevated him 
to the ranks of "A" directors. But, basically, he has spent the last three 
years struggling to get a film off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Ask him what he's learned from this protracted flirtation with the film 
industry and he declares that "I've learned that the major studios don't want 
to make movies with me -- and I don't know why that is. I think they respect 
me, but when it comes down to it, they don't want to take a chance because I 
could ruin things for them. Hollywood is a fragile place and heads roll easily 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"As to how all this has affected me, you just learn what your lot in life is, 
and I think my lot in life is to be true to your school, like the Beach Boys 
said. And, really, my lot in life is pretty great. I have faith that I can make 
the pictures I wanna make and have them near the main center but still be 
different in ways that are important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Though Lynch is exasperated by three years of misfired deals, he hasn't let the 
slowly creaking machinery of Hollywood hamper his creative output. In fact, 
Lynch has so many irons in the fire that it's hard to figure out how he fits 
everything in. On his current agenda: 
</P>
<P>
* A series of new paintings is presently on view at the James Corcoran Gallery 
in Santa Monica. Trained as a painter, Lynch also maintains a career in the 
visual arts and is represented in New York by the prestigious Leo Castelli 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
* Lynch's debut LP, "Floating Into the Night," will be released by Warner 
Brothers Records next month. Done in collaboration with singer Julee Cruise and 
composer Angelo Badalamenti, the pop music record features lyrics and 
production by Lynch. Lynch will also design a set and direct Cruise's fall tour 
to promote the record. 
</P>
<P>
* He's presently at work on a musical program to be presented this fall at the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the New Music America series. 
</P>
<P>
* He had the male lead in Tina Rathbourne's debut film of last year, "Zelly and 
Me," and continues to occasionally go up for acting parts. 
</P>
<P>
* A coffeetable book of Lynch's writings, drawings and photographs will be 
published next year by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
* He co-wrote and directed the pilot for "Twin Peaks," a nighttime soap opera 
that will air on ABC early next year as a mid-season replacement. 
</P>
<P>
* He draws a weekly cartoon strip, "The Angriest Dog in the World," that 
appears locally in the L.A. Reader. 
</P>
<P>
* And, at long last, Lynch is shooting his fifth film, "Wild at Heart," 
scheduled for release by Propaganda Films next year. Based on a script by Lynch 
that he adapted from a novel by Barry Gifford, the film stars Laura Dern, 
Nicholas Cage, Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe and will be distributed 
domestically by Samuel Goldwyn Co. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's creative output is impressive, to say the least, but even more 
remarkable is the fact that he manages to do all that he does and still has the 
energy left over to win the devotion of nearly everyone who comes in contact 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
"David is an unusually balanced individual, very pure, focused and committed," 
says actor Kyle MacLachlan, who's starred in three Lynch projects ("Dune," 
"Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks"). "But what really makes him great is that he 
makes such an effort to get down to fundamental human issues. He's very good at 
taking the 
</P>
<P>
dilemmas in his own life and throwing them up on the screen, and it's amazing 
how emotionally candid he is in his work." 
</P>
<P>
Candid and unequivocating though he is in his work, Lynch is a fascinating 
bundle of contradictions off the set. When journalists attempt to describe him 
they frequently compare him to Jimmy Stewart, and Lynch does have a wholesome, 
boyish charm and a Midwestern drawl reminiscent of Stewart. But he has 
eccentricities decidedly at odds with Stewart's all-American archetype. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch has never bothered furnishing his house, for example, because he's never 
seen any furniture that he likes. "I like a real spare feel," he explains. "The 
way the Japanese live is thrilling to me." 
</P>
<P>
He loves to build things -- he's particularly fond of sheds -- and speaks of 
the glories of lumber in rapturous tones. ("This Old House," a PBS how-to show 
on home improvement, is one of the few TV programs that he watches.) A creature 
of habit who frequents the same four restaurants, where he always orders the 
same thing, he lives modestly in all respects other than his work, where he's 
an extravagant perfectionist. Though he maintains long and solid friendships 
with a few people (director Jack Fisk and cinematographer Fred Elms are two 
close friends), he rarely socializes. 
</P>
<P>
"David's not easy to get to know," says vocalist Cruise. "He's very careful and 
only trusts a few people, and though a lot of people want to claim his 
friendship, he has so much energy that he'd rather be submerged in his work 
than socialize. I think he's happiest when he's working." 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do have a pretty good time when I'm working," says Lynch over a tuna 
sandwich at Musso &amp; Franks, "but sometimes it's pure terror. There are 
mornings when I'm going to the set and I want to go anywhere but there because 
there are just too many things that can go wrong. How can I face this? It's too 
much! It can all go wrong and you can die the death. But, basically, I'm having 
a great time doing all the stuff I do." 
</P>
<P>
Born 41 years ago in Missoula, Mont., Lynch describes his parents as "regular 
people" and recalls his childhood as a bucolic montage of "picket fences, 
dreamy afternoons and camping trips." After high school graduation, he studied 
painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, married and 
had a daughter, Jennifer, now 20. (He subsequently divorced his first wife and 
married Mary Fisk, with whom he has a son, now 6. Lynch and Fisk divorced two 
years ago, and Lynch, who has kept steady company with actress Isabella 
Rossellini for the last three years, now lives alone in a house in the 
Hollywood Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
While at the academy, Lynch made an animated film short, "The Alphabet," which 
served as his entry to the American Film Institute, where he worked on his 
debut film, "Eraserhead," from 1971-76. 
</P>
<P>
There's no other movie remotely like "Eraserhead." Described by Lynch as "a 
dream of dark and troubling things," this astonishingly original, inexplicably 
erotic film articulates deeply rooted fears with such dreadful accuracy that 
it's been labeled a horror film. In fact, "Eraserhead's" story of a befuddled 
young man and his mutant baby is simply a devastatingly evocative recounting of 
one man's subconscious life. 
</P>
<P>
Released in 1977 and now permanently enshrined on the revival theater circuit, 
"Eraserhead" caught the eye of comedian/producer Mel Brooks, who hired Lynch to 
direct "The Elephant Man," a critical and commercial success that garnered 
Lynch an Academy Award nomination in 1980. From there, Lynch went on to what 
proved to be an ill-fated multi-picture deal with Italian entrepreneur Dino De 
Laurentiis, who hired Lynch to direct the film version of Frank Herbert's 
classic science-fiction novel "Dune." Budgeted at $40 million and three years 
in the making, "Dune" was one of the major commercial flops of 1984 and was 
Lynch's Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly what happened with 'Dune,' " says Lynch. "Sometimes I 
guess you're supposed to have a bad experience and I really had one -- 'Dune' 
was my failure and I blame myself for it." 
</P>
<P>
Having learned some painful lessons on "Dune," Lynch returned to the top of his 
game two years later with "Blue Velvet," but his relationship with De 
Laurentiis' company, DEG, had begun to sour. When DEG went bankrupt in 1988, 
three of Lynch's properties ended up in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"Dino's company going down had a lot to do with my not making a movie for three 
years," says Lynch. "A lot of my projects were tied up there, and it's hard to 
get geared up for new things when you have to deal with that kind of 
frustration. I'm almost on the verge of regaining control of the projects that 
got tied up at DEG ("Ronnie Rocket," "One Saliva Bubble," and "Up at the 
Lake"), and I still want to make them." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to work and tired of waiting for the dust to settle around the 
dissolution of DEG, Lynch decided to try his hand at television, first with a 
program called "The Cowboy and the Frenchman," which aired last year on French 
television, and now with "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Co-written by Lynch and Mark Frost, a writer Lynch has collaborated with on 
several projects during the last four years, "Twin Peaks" is a murder-mystery 
soap opera set in a logging town in the Pacific Northwest. Featuring a large 
ensemble cast, the 90-minute pilot was filmed for $3.8 million, put up by ABC 
and WorldVision, which is handling worldwide distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't try to make 'Twin Peaks' realistic -- it's sort of a mythical town 
and it's a desire town." says Lynch. "It's where you'd want to go at 10 at 
night to just float and see what was gonna happen. The story revolves around 
what happens when the most popular girl in high school is mysteriously murdered 
-- she's found floating face down at the Packard Saw Mill. We then get to know 
the secret lives of all the people in the town as an FBI agent attempts to 
unravel the crime." 
</P>
<P>
Though "Twin Peaks" has been picked up for seven episodes, Lynch will only 
direct the pilot -- for the simple reason that he'd rather make movies -- and 
subsequent episodes will be directed by Jonathan Sanger, Tim Hunter, Leslie 
Glatter, Tina Rathbourne, Mark Frost and Duwayne Dunham. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lynch is very high on "Twin Peaks," he generally has no interest in 
television. "I didn't watch much TV as a kid and I don't watch it now. I don't 
find anything beautiful or unique to the medium, and the only thing you can do 
on TV that you can't do in film is make a continuing story -- which is so cool! 
I love the idea of the soap-opera thing. 
</P>
<P>
"On the downside, there are more restrictions in TV, and you know up front you 
can't even think in certain directions. Heavy sex or violence is out -- 
although I think the kind of violence that's allowed on TV is the very worst 
kind. There's no feeling behind it, and that makes it completely diabolical." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many new faces that turn up in "Twin Peaks" is Julee Cruise, who 
performs a tune in the pilot written by Lynch and Badalamenti. Composer of the 
score for the hit film "Cousins," Badalamenti first teamed with Lynch on the 
song "The Mysteries of Love," which was featured in the score to "Blue Velvet," 
and the two have been working on various music projects, along with vocalist 
Cruise, for the last three years. The fruits of their labors can be heard on 
"Floating Into the Night," a moody record that smokes with the ethereal, heavy 
sensuality of music by the Cocteau Twins or the Cowboy Junkies. 
</P>
<P>
"Music's been real important to me since the time I was small," recalls Lynch, 
who played a central role in reviving the career of the late Roy Orbison when 
he featured Orbison's classic song "In Dreams" in "Blue Velvet." "And it's 
amazing how much we know that we don't realize we know. Like music -- I'm not a 
trained musician, but when you get into it, you discover you really do have an 
understanding of the form and have incredibly strong feelings about how music 
should be made. I'm not saying I'm a skilled musician, but me and Angelo -- 
who's a great musician -- have an instant dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
"David doesn't know how to talk in musical terms, so he talked to me like he 
was directing a film," says Cruise. "He'd say things like, 'Really sad, Julee, 
make it just rip your heart out!' Or, 'You're singing into a void and feel sad 
but not hopeless.' His music is different from his films. He's much more tender 
and intimate in his music -- it's as if he's whispering a secret to you in his 
songs." 
</P>
<P>
While Lynch's music focuses on the theme of romantic love, the dark side of his 
nature dominates his work as a visual artist. Built around a murky palette and 
an enigmatic vocabulary of crudely drawn forms, Lynch's figurative abstractions 
pulsate with an eerie quality of violence and menace. 
</P>
<P>
In a field where it usually takes years to build a career, Lynch debuted in 
1987 with a show at the respected James Corcoran Gallery. While his first show 
sold well and garnered fairly good reviews, his show last February at Castelli 
was lambasted by the New York Times. Though Lynch has worked steadily as a 
painter for the last 20 years, the fact that he's an established director who 
debuted with a one-man show at a heavyweight gallery rubbed some people the 
wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally the art world's been willing to take my work seriously, but I have 
encountered some resistance as far as my crossing over into their turf," says 
Lynch. "A critic in New York crucified me for my last show -- it really seemed 
to bug her that I went from zero to 60 in no time at all just because of who I 
was. Her review was like, who was I to show up at the Castelli Gallery with 
this worthless crap?" 
</P>
<P>
"The art world is very protective of its turf," says dealer James Corcoran, "so 
it's hard for people like David who are crossing over from another field. 
Several artists I know like his work very much, but at the same time, artists 
tend to be so dedicated that they have a hard time with the idea that someone 
could do art -- and do it well -- while maintaining a career in another field. 
</P>
<P>
Any turf war that Lynch's presence in the art world might have aroused didn't 
diminish public interest in his work, and the opening of his show two years ago 
drew hundreds of people. The man of the hour, however, missed this year's 
Corcoran opening, as he was behind the cameras for "Wild at Heart," which 
finally began shooting last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll shoot 60% of the film in L.A. this month on a budget of $9 or $10 
million -- which seems a bit high to me," Lynch says with concern (one of the 
things he learned on "Dune" was the dangers of big budgets). "As to what it's 
about, 'Wild at Heart' is about finding love in hell -- which might be a theme 
in all my movies. This particular hell is modern life, and it's set in the 
South. After we're done shooting in L.A., we'll finish up with some location 
stuff in New Orleans and El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex is central to 'Wild at Heart' in the same way it was in 'Blue Velvet,' " 
he continues. "Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical, but 
movies usually depict it in a completely flat way. Being explicit doesn't tap 
into the mystical aspect of it either -- in fact, that usually kills it because 
people don't want to see sex so much as they want to experience the emotions 
that go along with it. These things are hard to convey in film because sex is 
such a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
Sex is one of several volatile subjects that Lynch explores in his work; and 
through his work he expresses a world view with an accompanying code of 
morality. In "Blue Velvet," for instance, he depicted violent sex with a great 
deal of empathy -- a point of view some viewers found offensive. How conscious 
is he of the underlying messages in his work? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very dangerous thing," he says warily. "It's important to think about 
it but it's like money -- if you think of it first then you're like a 
politician. You're gearing your campaign around winning, and everything you say 
is to make the message known -- and a message is a load of crap. I don't know 
what I want to say to people. I get ideas and I want to put them on film 
because they thrill me. You may say that people look for meaning in everything, 
but they don't. They've got life going on around them, but they don't look for 
meaning there. They look for meaning when they go to a movie. I don't know why 
people expect art to make sense when they accept the fact that life doesn't 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's feelings about the senselessness of existence reach critical mass in 
his comic strip, "The Angriest Dog in the World." Best described as an ongoing 
study in despair, frustration and rage, the strip is often criticized as being 
highly perverse, and Lynch agrees: "Yes, it is perverse because the humor in 
the strip is based on sickness -- the sickness of people's pitiful state of 
unhappiness and misery. But it thrills me," he adds with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Absurdity is what I like most in life, and there's humor in struggling in 
ignorance. If you saw a man repeatedly running into a wall until he was a 
bloody pulp, after a while it would make you laugh because it becomes absurd. 
But I don't just find humor in unhappiness -- I find it extremely heroic the 
way people forge on despite the despair they often feel. Like the character in 
'Eraserhead' -- he's totally confused, yet he struggles to figure things out 
and do what's best. Isn't that fantastic? 
</P>
<P>
"Playing by rules made up by God knows who kinda stinks, but at the same time, 
it's fun playing the game," he says. "Life really is the greatest game, and 
somehow we seem to forget that. You know what dogs are like in a room? They 
really look like they're having fun. They're bouncing this ball around and 
chewing on stuff and they're kind of panting and happy. Human beings are 
supposed to be like that. We can be in a lot of trouble, but basically we 
should be pretty happy. And I don't know why we aren't."

SANTA FE OPERA AUDIENCES WILLING TO EMBRACE NOVELTY AS WELL AS LUXURIATE IN 
SAFE, FAMILIAR PLEASURES

SANTA FE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some things do change. Some things change even in the irrational, potentially 
lofty world of the lyric muse. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Opera, now celebrating its 33rd season, used to be an ambitious, 
struggling, quaintly modest all-American mirage. It was the private toy, and 
the dream-gone-public, of a stubbornly idealistic, sadly second-rate conductor 
named John Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders in those distant days, Santa Fe was a sleepy little desert city 
known primarily for its high altitude, artists' colony, ski facilities and 
Indian market. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Santa Fe Opera has become a slick, ambitious, high-powered, 
quasi-international festival, and a popular tourist mecca all by itself. It 
clings to its adventurous image, but, with the passage of time, seems to have 
become a little prosperous, a little paunchy and a little smug. Ev 
</P>
<P>
erything operatic, of course, is relative. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe itself has retained its chronic -- some might say terminal -- charm. 
The turquoise-and-silver jewelry, howling-coyote sculptures, primitive adobe 
facades, lethal margaritas, tough blue-corn tortillas and honey-buttered 
sopaipillas still exert their special compulsion. So do the ageless cactus 
flowers, not to mention the superannuated flower-children. But the New Mexico 
capital has grown drastically in size, as well as glamour, sophistication and 
snob appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Some visitors find it very important to stay in the right expensive hotel 
(assuming rooms are still available), to eat in the right trendy-folksy 
restaurant (if a table still happens to be available), to frequent the right 
gallery (especially if the visitor can casually drop the name of Georgia 
O'Keeffe as if she were an old friend) and to attend the right socially 
prominent party (one crashes if an invitation cannot be wangled). 
</P>
<P>
Old Canyon Road has become chic-boutique heaven. It also has become a classy 
yet bucolic haven from ubiquitous shopping-mall placidity and plasticity. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't want to go to the opera (or can't commandeer one of the 1,773 
seats available each night) can find some solace in other arts nearby. A tiny 
summer theater has materialized a couple of blocks from the old plaza, offering 
intimate musicals as well as vintage drama. Numerous mini-museums dot the 
marvelously cloudy horizon. A splendid, far-reaching chamber-music festival 
holds forth in a variety of attractive locations, including an ancient church. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond all that, one can find choral concerts, modern-dance concerts, poetry 
readings and art movies in Santa Fe. A really famous flamenco virtuosa appears 
nightly in one of the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the Santa Fe summer, the opera is the thing. A new off-ramp takes 
the visitor from the Taos highway to the quasi-alfresco theater on the hill, 
some 7 miles from town. The famous, venerable road sign still volunteers useful 
advice: "OPERA TRAFFIC KEEP LEFT." 
</P>
<P>
The performances begin at 9 -- when it is reasonably dark. This means that the 
longer operas, "Der Rosenkavalier" for instance, end after midnight. No one 
seems to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Aficionados, laden with blankets and in some cases with umbrellas, arrive early 
to observe the magical sunset and to absorb the vast panorama of anonymous 
mesas, Sangre de Cristo Mountains and Los Alamos lights. The lights also can be 
seen during performances, flickering behind the open stage if the set designer 
happens to be sensitive to natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
On balmy nights, the mood can be so euphoric that it comes close to stifling 
any base critical impulses. Luckily, balm tends to be reasonably scarce around 
here. 
</P>
<P>
On cold nights, the concession stands do a brisk business in weak coffee or 
cocoa spiked with strong brandy. On stormy nights, dramatic intrusions of wind, 
rain and lightning can embellish the action and discommode those seated in the 
central, unroofed portion of the auditorium. No one seems to care -- much. 
</P>
<P>
John Crosby has come up with a general formula for his repertory. Each summer 
he tries to offer two standard items, two contrasting examples of esoterica and 
something very new. 
</P>
<P>
It is a healthy formula. Luckily, his audiences seem nearly as willing to 
embrace novelty as they are eager to luxuriate in safe, familiar pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe prides itself on discovering and nurturing talent, most of it young 
and most of it American. The company also prides itself on cultivating ensemble 
values. Occasionally, however, a star turn is permitted, even encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case with Massenet's "Cherubin." The opera itself, never staged 
professionally in this country, is a strange, fragile fusion of perfumed 
banalities and charming poignancies, anno 1905. The titular hero of this period 
piece is borrowed from Mozart and Da Ponte, but neither the convoluted libretto 
nor the formula score does much to honor the noble source. And there is no 
Figaro in sight. 
</P>
<P>
If it is to make any sense today, "Cherubin" demands, above all, a stage 
director with a light, elegant touch. Giulio Chazalettes, unfortunately, 
contented himself with ponderous cliches, encouraging his cast to undertake a 
lot of prancing, mugging and leering. 
</P>
<P>
Under the clumsy circumstances, it was easier than usual to surrender to 
Frederica von Stade, here irresistibly breathless, guileless and impetuous as 
the love-sick incipient officer en travesti (a role created by Mary Garden). On 
a less exalted plane, one could admire the sweet lyricism of Sheryl Woods as 
the girl who really loves Cherubin and the flamboyant lyricism of Karen 
Huffstodt as the vamp who discards him. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast was grim. So was the amateurish incidental choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Bernardi conducted with elan. Ulisse Santicchi's decors looked lavish 
(the costumes were borrowed from Milan). Everyone worked hard, but it wasn't 
enough. Crosby &amp; Co. ended up suggesting that "Cherubin" really deserves 
the oblivion it has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
More successful, in its brazen campy-kinky way, was the first local production 
of Cavalli's "La Calisto" (1651). John Cox updated the proceedings -- the usual 
mythic melange of picturesque nymphs and cunning satyrs, mortal gods and godly 
mortals, mistaken identities and knowing masquerades -- with deep respect for 
the cute, the timeless and the irreverent. As is customary in Santa Fe, he 
savored any opportunity to stress sexual ambiguity or sensual innuendo. Robert 
Perdziola, the resourceful designer, seconded every trendy motion. 
</P>
<P>
The excellent cast was headed by Tatiana Troyanos, lush and authoritative as 
the virgin goddess Diana who lusts, after a fashion, after the limpid Calisto 
of Janice Hall. Most notable among the others happily caught in one 
semi-amorous web or another were Kevin Langan (the sonorous, cigar-chomping 
Jove), Mikael Melbye (the flitting Mercury), Drew Minter (the piping 
countertenoral shepherd), John Fryatt (the executive nymph in matronly drag) 
and Kathryn Gamberoni (the sweetly hermaphroditic Satirino). 
</P>
<P>
Justin Brown conducted Raymond Leppard's suave, moderately stylish performing 
edition with appreciative brio. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Weir's "A Night at the Chinese Opera," which received its U.S. premiere 
here, is witty and crafty, potentially stark and eloquent. A bold and bizarre 
fusion of ancient Asian drama, Marx Brothers comedy, Brechtian tragedy and 
political parody, its impact would seem to depend on an intimate theater and a 
cautious stage director. 
</P>
<P>
The Kent Opera reportedly provided both for the first performances, much lauded 
in Cheltenham two years ago. Santa Fe, alas, provided neither. 
</P>
<P>
In the wide open spaces here, the words tended to get lost, along with the 
fragile expressive subtext. The fundamental emotive definitions blurred in 
Robert Carsen's gimmicky production, Michael Levine's clever sets 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
George Manahan conducted with just the right combination of efficiency and 
passion. The cast performed with dedicated zest. The orchestra sputtered and 
soared with apparent conviction. Still, one felt as if the crucial, clever 
narrative were taking place in some all-too-distant room. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe has always been most compelling when the company dealt with the 
unknown, least impressive when it tried to tame old warhorses. The latest 
versions of "La Traviata" and "Der Rosenkavalier" proved, once again, that the 
tried doesn't invariably ring true. 
</P>
<P>
"Traviata" looked hopelessly, clumsily conventional as staged by John Copley in 
cumbersome, garish sets by Perdziola (the lavish costumes of Michael Stennet 
came courtesy of the Australian Opera). The raison d'etre for the endeavor, no 
doubt, was Sheri Greenawald, rather brittle in tone though eminently touching 
as the introspective, vulnerable Violetta. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby surrounded her with an aggressively competent entourage of comprimarios 
and an inadequate pair of Germonts: Richard Drews as a painfully constricted 
Alfredo and Brent Ellis as a stiff and cranky Giorgio. Both encountered serious 
pitch problems. 
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging contribution to a rather dismal evening came from the 
young conductor, John Fiore. Taking over from John Crosby, he demonstrated a 
rare grasp of the arching Verdi cantilena plus rare sympathy for the singers' 
individual needs. 
</P>
<P>
The operas of Richard Strauss have long enjoyed special favor with Crosby. 
"Rosenkavalier," however, had not been ventured here for 20 years. The pause 
has not refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
Copley stressed vulgar burlesque in his stage maneuvers. He allowed Baron Ochs 
to act more like an ox than a baron, and actually permitted his retainers to 
take the preposterous liberty of testing the Marschallin's bed. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin's confusing sets began with a nice, realistic boudoir for the 
Marschallin. With her anteroom remaining oddly in place, this gave way to an 
incredibly tasteless foyer for the nouveau-riche Faninal manor. Then, without 
warning, the designer shifted stylistic gears for an cluttered Expressionist 
jumble that supposedly represented the seedy inn. At least David Walker's 
costumes, on loan from the English National Opera, retained a semblance of 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
The problematic, ill-matched cast should have been dominated by the Marschallin 
of Ashley Putnam. For all her persuasive intelligence, she she looked more like 
a Barbie doll than a mature Viennese princess. It is true that the composer and 
librettist thought of Marie Theres' as a 32-year-old. If she is to be played 
that way, however, Octavian and Sophie must register as credible teen-agers. 
That certainly didn't happen here. 
</P>
<P>
Even more problematic, Putnam found the vocal line uncomfortably low, the 
orchestral component uncomfortably thick and the demands for aristocratic 
bearing just plain uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many a more famous colleague, Eric Halfvarson can sing every 
unreasonable note Strauss prescribed for Ochs -- high and low (very low), loud 
and soft, fast and slow. On this occasion, unfortunately, he concentrated on 
bellowing and grunting. Crude to the end, he missed the charm of the character, 
along with the muted nobility. He deserves better direction. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Piland, remembered from numerous New York City Opera assignments and 
Tchaikovsky's Joan of Arc in Reno, returned from Europe as a bland, chubby 
Octavian, opposite the tough looking, ethereal sounding Sophie of Cheryl 
Parrish. Peter Strummer projected an authentic Faninal. Richard Drews as the 
Italian Singer simulated the Pavarotti manner if not the Pavarotti tone. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby stirred up a great deal of business-like noise in the pit. It all 
sounded primitive and prosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Some things don't change.

DICK EBERSOL'S BACK ON THE FAST TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDENLY, A ONE-TIME 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' EXECUTIVE IS A FORCE IN NBC'S SPORTS 
AND NEWS DEPARTMENTS

<P>
"Willard, buddy," says Dick Ebersol, smooth and confidential on the phone to 
"Today" show weatherman Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
It's still two weeks before Ebersol officially takes over as the NBC executive 
in charge of "Today," but he's already working the phones from his Rockefeller 
Center Office. It probably won't be long before "Today" posters are added to 
the collection of TV posters that he keeps in his office. All are shows that 
Ebersol has had a hand in: "Saturday Night Live," "Wide World of Sports," 
"Friday Night Videos" and the wrestling program "Saturday Night's Main Event." 
</P>
<P>
From his days as a long-haired vice president shepherding an unruly "Saturday 
Night Live" through the corporate brass, Dick Ebersol has made a career of 
succeeding in surprising places. "I don't buy into this notion that you have to 
have an identity card that labels you as any one thing in television," says the 
42-year-old Ebersol. "I define myself as a TV person with curiosity about the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the TV world is curious about Dick Ebersol. In April, seemingly out of 
nowhere, he was named president of NBC Sports. Then last month, Ebersol -- who 
has no traditional hard-news experience -- was given the additional title of 
senior vice president of NBC News, and he officially took charge Wednesday. His 
plum assignment: day-to-day control of "Today," the top-rated morning-news 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Ebersol, a close friend of both "Today" host Bryant Gumbel 
and NBC entertainment chief Brandon Tartikoff, comes at a time when some NBC 
News employees are expressing unhappiness with the style and budget cuts of NBC 
News president Michael Gartner. Add to that the fact that TV is experimenting 
with new forms of "reality" programming that hopscotch the lines between news, 
sports and entertainment -- and you've got Dick Ebersol as a man to watch. 
"Everyone is wondering about Ebersol," says one NBC executive. "He's perceived 
as being on the fast track to running NBC News." 
</P>
<P>
Minor-league sports scores on "Today"? Hulk Hogan as White House correspondent? 
Don't look for it, says Ebersol. As he points out, his double duty is not 
unprecedented. Ebersol's old boss, former ABC sports chief Roone Arledge, 
created "Nightline" and other innovative news programs as head of ABC news. 
</P>
<P>
"When Roone came in, people were wondering when Howard Cosell would start 
anchoring 'World News Tonight,' " says Ebersol. "Well, Howard has retired, and 
Roone is seen as the senior executive in TV news. . . . I'm not some graduate 
of the Joe Schmo school of sports or variety shows. The straight line through 
my career is live television, whether seeing the right spin on a sports event 
or getting the right producers to cut news footage." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Today" remains the No. 1 network morning-news show, the gap between 
it and ABC's "Good Morning America" has narrowed recently. With the 
unauthorized disclosure last spring of host Bryant Gumbel's analysis of the 
show, including a brusque criticism of weatherman Scott as a hogger of air 
time, "Today's" ratings dipped briefly. "The show needed innovation and new 
leadership," says NBC's Tartikoff. "It seemed to be running on previous 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
In today's increasingly star-driven newscasts, Ebersol adds diplomacy with 
on-air talent to the executive's resume. "Bryant and Willard have two different 
philosophies: Willard the showman and Bryant the perfectionist, driving himself 
to do the best interview," says Ebersol. "I like to think that I might have 
been able to throw a warm blanket over the controversy if I'd been there at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Before he had begun the job officially, Ebersol was already dropping by the 
"Today" control room during the early-morning broadcast, meeting senior 
producers and "hearing the thoughts" of Gumbel, co-host Jane Pauley and Scott 
about the program. "I had a meeting with him where he acted as if he had 
nothing else on his agenda besides seeking my views about the show," says 
Pauley. "Bryant and Willard are up (emotionally), and there's a general feeling 
that Dick represents a new cycle -- that we don't have to cede No. 1 to someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
"Today" staffers are hopeful that Ebersol's high profile will bring them 
additional financial resources from an ever-competitive pie. "Ebersol is the 
kind of guy who has to succeed at whatever he does," says one news executive. 
"He'll be a financial advocate for the show." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel declined to speak about Ebersol. But NBC sources say that having Ebersol 
overseeing the show puts a friend between Gumbel and NBC News president 
Gartner. "Bryant didn't like Gartner, and he thought the 'Today' show was 
getting short shrift," says one NBC News source. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol bridles at the suggestion that his friendship with Gumbel got him the 
job. "Bryant never knew that I had any interest in being involved in the 
'Today' show," he says. "I think he and Brandon probably figured that sports 
was what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a lawyer from Litchfield, Conn., Ebersol was one of those '50s kids 
who literally waved to the rest of their generation from the studio window of 
the old "Today" show. "When I was 9 years old, my father brought me to the 
'Today' show studio, and I saw Dave Garroway do the show through a window. When 
(NBC chief executive) Bob Wright offered me the presidency of NBC Sports in 
April, I said I had this one other dream aside from running sports, which was 
to run the 'Today' show. Gartner and I started talking about things we might do 
together, and we resolved ourselves to go ahead on the 'Today' show." They're 
already working on their first joint venture between news and sports -- several 
upcoming documentaries along the lines of Tom Brokaw's recent documentary about 
black athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great relationship," says Gartner. "Dick is smart and decisive, and he 
likes to try new things." Despite rumors that the 50-year-old Gartner may 
leave, he says, "I plan to be here until I retire." 
</P>
<P>
The other intense TV image in Ebersol's memory was the premiere of ABC's "Wide 
World of Sports" in the 1960s. "I was a frustrated athlete. . . . When I saw 
'Wide World,' I understood that Arledge was doing something new -- taking 
sports events and turning them into stories seen through the eyes of the 
competitors. When I went to the LeMans car race in 1965, 800,000 Frenchmen were 
watching the race -- and I was looking around for the 'Wide World' crew so I 
could get hired as a gofer. I wanted in -- and that's how I got in." 
</P>
<P>
Hired as an Olympics researcher in 1967, Ebersol became Arledge's assistant and 
later became director of program development for ABC Sports. At ABC he produced 
numerous sporting events for "Wide World of Sports" before being hired away by 
NBC in 1974 to be director of late-night programming. "Herb Schlosser (then 
president of NBC) had offered me the job of being No. 2 at NBC Sports," says 
Ebersol. "I wasn't ready to compete with Roone and I wasn't sure that NBC was 
going to go after the big sports events. I turned the job down, but Schlosser 
made up his mind that NBC needed a 'youth movement' among its executives, so he 
offered me the job of running late-night." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, wearing thick glasses and a hippie haircut, Ebersol pitched the NBC 
affiliates on a new late-night comedy show called "Saturday Night Live." "I was 
guaranteed the 11:30 p.m. time slot, a year to get the show ready, and at least 
six months on the air," Ebersol said. As the network's youngest vice president 
at 28, Ebersol is credited with being the network brass who let "SNL" be "SNL" 
while producer Lore Michaels focused more on the creative side. "Dick ran 
interference between us and the network," says "SNL" writer Al Franken. "He ran 
a well-structured ship so the show could be as loose as possible." 
</P>
<P>
But according to "Saturday Night," a backstage book by Doug Hill and Jeff 
Weingrad, there were strong differences between Michaels and Ebersol over how 
much creative credit Ebersol took for the show. Says Franken, "I think they're 
way beyond that now." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Ebersol returned to "SNL" as executive producer, replacing producer 
Jean Doumanian and staying till 1985, during the Billy Crystal and Eddie Murphy 
eras. The show made Murphy a star, but overall it was not compared favorably 
with the original. Still, says Tartikoff, "As far as I'm concerned, Dick saved 
the show." Ebersol then took his series commitments from NBC, part of his 
business deal for producing "SNL," and started his own independent production 
company. Before being named head of NBC Sports, Ebersol was a successful 
producer, with "Friday Night Videos," "Saturday Night's Main Event" and "Later 
With Bob Costas." 
</P>
<P>
Married to actress Susan St. James of "Kate &amp; Allie," Ebersol lives in a 
Colonial-style compound that would do credit to the Kennedys: The troop 
includes their sons, Charlie, 6, and Willie, 2, and her two children, Sunshine 
and Harmony, by a previous marriage. Her parents live in a guest house on the 
property; his parents live down the road. "Susan has just gutted the main house 
and put up a tent over the garage where we all eat," he says. "People accuse me 
of taking this job to avoid the renovations." 
</P>
<P>
If he is still formulating his plans for "Today," Ebersol already has moved 
quickly in sports. Last spring he fired NBC sports executive producer Mike 
Weisman, replacing him with CBS Sports' Terry O'Neil, a long-time colleague. 
O.J. Simpson and former San Francisco 49er Coach Bill Walsh have been signed up 
as analysts for NBC's National Football League coverage. And, besides Wimbledon 
and other events, NBC is experimenting with some unusual sports programming, 
such as a series on boxing's best bouts, and a TV movie based on "Joe D. and 
the Blonde," Roger Kahn's book about Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
But don't get Ebersol started on losing major-league baseball to CBS, which has 
sold off its music and publishing businesses, and is flush with cash. "How can 
people write that CBS 'won' baseball?," he says vehemently. "They're going to 
lose a minimum of a quarter of a million dollars over the next four years!" 
</P>
<P>
With the increased competition for rights to sporting events by the networks, 
cable and other sources, NBC has made its own $400-million investment for the 
rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. That compares to the 
$300 million that NBC paid for the rights to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
But last year's ratings fell below those guaranteed to Summer Olympics' 
advertisers, and it was reported that NBC had to provide as much as $70 million 
in extra commercials to advertisers to make up for those low ratings. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the cost to the 1992 Summer Olympics, Ebersol says, NBC will offer a 
new pay-per-view package, as yet unannounced, with a consortium of cable 
operators. "One of the complaints of fans for various events is that they don't 
get to see the event all the way through in the Olympics coverage," he says. 
"This way, viewers will be able to see three different events channels." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to news. Supporting Gartner in the budget cutbacks, 
Ebersol says, "If someone hadn't come along and grabbed control in terms of 
finances, this place would have been faced in three or four years with whether 
or not to be in this business. I'm not saying that news has to make a profit, 
but we can't subsidize something out of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Would Ebersol want the tough job of running NBC News? "No. And, most of all, I 
don't want to be president of NBC News and NBC Sports. You can't do both. And 
nothing would get me to give up doing the Olympics in Barcelona in 1992. Does 
that leave me a little opening after that?" He laughs. "Post-Barcelona will be 
post-Barcelona."

UNDERDOG TALK STATION KFI JOINS THE FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The subject was betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
"Your life has gone to shambles," said Mother Love in her sultriest, silkiest 
tones. "Your trust has been replaced. What do you do? . . . If you've got a 
good betrayal story, give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
It was midnight and the first night on the job for one of L.A.'s newest 
talk-show hosts, and callers lit up the KFI switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
Calls came from young men who had been burned by women they misjudged, women 
who had been two-timed by philandering married men, a baffled man who found his 
"perfect woman" was, in fact, a man. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the call that really set off Mother Love, former Cleveland comedian 
Jo Anne Hart. "I've been betrayed by the management at KFI," the male voice 
said. "I'm really sorry that they replaced the intelligent interviews of Larry 
King. . . . I just think the station has gone so far overboard into being a 
radio tabloid show with these kind of topics. KFI panders to voyeurism. It's 
nothing against you, I assure you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her moniker, Mother Love was not dispensing good vibes: "What can I 
say? You get bent out of shape. You'll live. Get a life. I am an employee here. 
I do as I am told, at the time I am told. They told me 'Mother Love 10 till 1.' 
Hey, that's it. That's the way it goes. Larry King is still alive and well on 
KFI from 1 a.m. till 4 a.m. We will have stimulating talk radio all night 
long." 
</P>
<P>
We see ourselves as the Arsenio Hall of talk radio and KABC is Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KFI General Manager Howard Neal 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Although the comparison to late-night TV talk-show hosts may seem like so much 
mixed media, underdog talk station KFI-AM (640) is using a strategy they hope 
may duplicate the success of Arsenio Hall. By bringing in younger, hipper, 
on-air personalities, KFI's management believes they might capture a similar 
audience to the one that Hall has attracted to his late-night alternative to 
the long-reigning Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
With this strategy and other moves, the station that's only been in talk radio 
for 13 months is taking on the one that pioneered talk radio in Los Angeles, 
KABC-AM (790). The programming and personality changes at KFI were quickly 
followed by countermeasures and upheaval at KABC. 
</P>
<P>
This jockeying to grab more listeners has resulted in nearly a month and a half 
of tumultuous change that is unusual, even in the volatile and highly 
competitive L.A radio market. And this may just be the preliminary -- the fight 
figures to get even more intense in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The two stations have also been feuding in the courtroom. KABC filed suit in 
U.S. District Court on April 3 charging KFI with trademark infringement. KABC 
claims that the term Talkradio is a trademark that it "invented and adopted" 
and has been using for 17 years. The station has said that it's spent millions 
of dollars in advertising and promotion using the term as its slogan. KFI 
maintains that talk radio is a generic term that describes a programming 
format. In May, KFI was temporarily enjoined from using the moniker in 
conjunction with its call letters and dial position. A ruling is expected Sept. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
But it's over the airwaves that the battle takes on its highest profile. 
</P>
<P>
The move that KFI made that brought the call from the betrayed listener was 
made Aug. 7. The 35-year-old Mother Love was brought in to appeal to a younger 
target audience with her offbeat blend of street-wise advice and earthy humor. 
She moved into the 10 p.m.-to-1 a.m. slot that was formally occupied by Larry 
King, longtime syndicated talk-show host. His more serious issues-oriented show 
was shoved into the 1 a.m.-to-4 a.m. slot. KFI managers explained the change by 
saying they wanted the appeal of a local personality rather than a syndicated 
program from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens when you have a real war," said Tom Leykis, host of an 
increasingly successful "verbal combat" show at KFI. "This is what happens when 
you have real competition. The stations start making moves like this." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a full-fledged battle all the way around," said veteran 
broadcaster Gary Owens, a former KFI morning-show host who himself was dumped 
early last month. 
</P>
<P>
How has the war gone so far? 
</P>
<P>
Though KFI's ratings aren't startling, compared to the No. 3-rated KABC, it has 
managed to crack the Top 20 during the most recent Arbitron ratings period, 
less than a year after changing to the talk format. The station went from No. 
25 to the 20th spot. KABC, which has been in the Top Five of all L.A. stations 
for the last eight years, also jumped in the latest ratings period, which seems 
to reflect an increasing audience for talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high in the market. Los Angeles has 9 million potential radio 
listeners, and the market is No. 1 in terms of advertising sales. Talk-radio 
station KABC in the latest Arbitron survey netted a 7.2 share (or about 144,000 
people older than 18) during morning drive time -- when most people listen to 
radio. The car is also the reason that makes Southern California such a prime 
battleground for a talk-radio war. In fact, listeners dialing in from car 
phones now make up a good percentage of callers. 
</P>
<P>
"In-car listening has a lot to do with it," said John Dobel of Birch 
Scarborough Research Corp.'s radio ratings group. "This is a better market than 
some for talk radio." 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers really help generate revenues," said J. Ray Padden, vice president 
of West Coast Radio Advertising Bureau. And, Padden said, talk radio is a 
popular and financially lucrative format. High ratings can mean tens of 
millions of advertising dollars for the station. 
</P>
<P>
And this shapes up as a record year for radio advertising revenues. Ad sales 
for the first six months of 1989 have been the highest in history -- $235 
million so far, compared to $353 million for all of last year, to be divided 
among Southern California's 80 or so radio stations. A single rating point -- 
equivalent to between 13,000 and 20,000 listeners -- can mean at least a 
million dollars in advertising to a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
Talk radio, as a genre, has long been popular. And in big cities it may even be 
growing in popularity, radio analysts say. In the first six months of 1989, the 
number of new stations with the talk format increased by 8%, Padden said. Talk 
radio is the ninth most popular radio format, with 433 stations nationwide. 
(The most popular format is country, followed by adult contemporary.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's the little last vestige of the town meeting," said physician Dean Edell, 
whose syndicated talk radio program is heard in 200 markets. "The little guy 
can have his thoughts heard by thousands. He can talk to the biggest of the 
big. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk radio stations in the top 50 markets throughout the country historically 
are always in the top 10," Padden said. "They're usually tied in with a sports 
franchise which are very marketable and lend a lot of additional visibility. 
It's a nice combination." 
</P>
<P>
KABC has exclusive rights to broadcast Dodger games and KFI has the rights to 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
However, with baseball season drawing to a close at the end of September, KABC 
will not have its trump card to fend off the onslaught of upstart KFI. To hold 
on to its lofty ratings in the fall quarter, the station must assemble a mighty 
lineup, and that is one of the major forces driving the current war. 
</P>
<P>
There's an old saying that if it ain't broke you don't fix it, and KABC was 
never broke. I don't know what they're up to. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dean Edell, whose syndicated medical show moves from KABC to KFI next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KABC, in existence for 29 years, has long been the dominant player on the local 
talk-radio scene. KFI is a relative newcom 
</P>
<P>
er, having changed to the format in July, 1988. Its ratings had been dismal, 
until this spring. In the last quarterly Arbitron survey, KFI hit No. 20, 
eclipsing two other talk stations, KIEV and KGIL, with weaker signals and lower 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the marshaling of forces by KFI, KABC has begun to tamper with 
its winning formula, creating a crisis in management in the process. For 
example, to answer KFI's emphasis on local programming, as of next month all of 
KABC's shows will originate from their Los Angeles studio and will no longer 
provide programming to the ABC national network. But KFI isn't standing still 
either. 
</P>
<P>
* KABC last month dropped popular Dr. David Viscott, at KABC for eight years, 
and replaced him with a call-in psychology/issues show hosted by Detroit 
personality Sonya Friedman, generating lots of angry letters from loyal 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
* Tom Snyder's evening syndicated program was dropped last month and Superfan, 
Ed Bieler (currently on the air at KCMO, Kansas City), will return to KABC 
sometime after baseball season, most likely in Snyder's old time slot. 
</P>
<P>
* The time slot of KABC top-rated morning personalities Ken Minyard and Bob 
Arthur ("The Ken and Bob Co.") switched from 5-10 a.m. to 5-9 a.m., and 
talk-show host Michael Jackson picked up the extra hour and is now heard 9 
a.m-1 p.m. instead of 10 a.m.-2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* As of mid-September Michael Jackson and Ray Briem, late-night conservative 
talk-show host, will no longer be heard on the ABC national network. Each will 
refocus his issues-oriented call-in show on local topics. 
</P>
<P>
* In the past month KFI brought in Terry Rae Elmer and Dave Grosby from 
KFBK-AM, the Sacramento station where program director George Oliva had worked, 
replacing Gary Owens and Al Lohman from 5 to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* Mother Love and Australian Christopher Bartlett, seen by some as the 
station's answer to KABC's South African Michael Jackson, started two weeks ago 
in the evening lineup. Bartlett replaced a sports talk show hosted by Chris 
Roberts, who is on 7 to 10 p.m., and Mother Love from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* KABC lured away Dick Whittington from KIEV last week. His show will likely be 
heard on weekends starting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
* KABC last week lost Edell and his syndicated medical show to KFI. Edell will 
have an hour afternoon slot starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
* Rumors indicate that veteran broadcaster Wink Martindale may quit amid 
speculation about the impending demise of his and Bill Smith's show. ("The Wink 
and Bill Show" is the only one that KFI was able to beat in the 25-64 age 
category in the recent Arbitrends survey, though Wink and Bill's overall 
audience is still substantially larger than Leykis'.) 
</P>
<P>
* Psychologist Toni Grant, one of KFI's top ratings-getter and one of the 
best-known personalities on talk radio, will soon be retiring from the station, 
program director Oliva said, to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
* About two weeks ago KABC program director John Rook abruptly quit after eight 
months at the station, and no replacement has been named. 
</P>
<P>
Rook said in a telephone interview from his Idaho ranch last week that he left 
because he and KABC general manager George Green did not agree on programming 
matters. Rook said Green did not heed his input and insisted on making most 
programming decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes to control and I'm not very easily controlled," Rook said. "It just 
got to the point where I have to have more control over my own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rook said he believed Green was trying to undermine the afternoon "The 
Wink and Bill Show." Rook said he did not believe Green was standing behind it. 
Green was quoted in several newspaper stories, referring to the show as the 
weak link in the station's daily lineup, saying the show was being carefully 
watched to determine if it would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry are puzzled as to why KABC is bothering to change a 
formula that has kept them consistently among the top five stations for the 
last eight years. Before that, it was in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's strange," said KFI programming director George Oliva. "Here's a 
station that has really been very dominant, very strong for 20 years and all of 
a sudden they start changing their programming." 
</P>
<P>
Green denies that the changes are being propelled by KFI's improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not making changes because of KFI," Green said. "How can our radio 
station be affected by a radio station that's not doing anything?" 
</P>
<P>
However, a former staff member who asked that his name not be used, said: "He's 
scared to death of KFI and that itself is ridiculous. He listens to more of 
them than he does us." 
</P>
<P>
Green maintains that the new-found competition has improved KABC. 
</P>
<P>
"Their existence makes us review what we do and makes you sharper. I'm pleased 
at the fact that they are there because if anything (the competition) makes us 
a better facility. . . . I think it's all very healthy up to a point. . . . And 
if they're able to attract a younger audience, great. Once they find them, 
they'll find us." 
</P>
<P>
But, "we've still got to get better at what we do," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
KABC is not No. 1 in the overall AM market -- like sister talk station KGO-AM 
in San Francisco -- and wants to be. They have lost listeners, particularly in 
afternoon drive time -- to KFI as well as to other stations. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that KFI's top ratings-getter, the verbally combative Tom 
Leykis whose show airs from 3 to 7 p.m., opposite Martindale and Smith, "is 
doing very slightly better than the rest of the radio station." 
</P>
<P>
"KFI had been having a very difficult time in the ratings for many years. Now 
they have come in with some brand-new talk personalities that are making hits 
for them," Padden said. "I think the talk format on KFI has gotten good, the 
ratings have started to move. I think it's going to be a battle now. KFI has 
put in some very strong personalities in morning, afternoon drive, and 
mid-morning and most of the day. It will give KABC a fight and KABC has 
reacted." 
</P>
<P>
When KFI jumped to the Top 20 this last ratings period, from a 1.3 to a 1.8, it 
made a 25% jump, Padden said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice little move that kind of ties with their new programming and 
that will generate new dollars for them," Padden said. 
</P>
<P>
As people move past the 40-45 mark in their life cycles, they become less 
interested in music programming and they tend to use radio more for news and 
information and certainly a popular aspect of that is talk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tom Birch, chairman of Birch Scarborough Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both stations acknowledge that they are working on attracting younger 
listeners. However, their methods to accomplish this differ. KFI is actively 
courting more youthful listeners and minorities (talk radio has long been a 
bastion for older, white listeners), by bringing in younger on-air 
personalities who discuss more youth-oriented topics, such as "bitchy women" or 
"what is tacky," two recent subjects tackled by Mother Love. Leykis has a 
regular program in which he matches up singles who call in for a date. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy at KABC, on the other hand, is that good programming will draw 
listeners of all ages and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make a concerted effort to reach any specific group," Green said. "I 
don't think a radio station should make a concerted effort." 
</P>
<P>
At the helm of the clear front-runner, Green's is a less aggressive approach. 
He also expects some of the new younger listeners drawn to KFI to sample KABC 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who would like them who would also like us," Green said. 
"Once they find them, they'll find us." 
</P>
<P>
Both are focusing on local origination, cutting back on network programming and 
re-dedicating themselves to local issues. However, KFI is gaining a reputation 
for more exploitative programming and more controversial, flamboyant on-air 
personalities, while KABC is viewed as a more established, mainstream 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to win, then they have to find a niche and I think they have 
chosen that tabloid niche, that rock 'em, sock 'em and intimidate 'em on the 
air," Green said. "We would never take that approach. We have a very classy, 
traditional all-talk format that's been around for ages. . . . Class comes 
first." 
</P>
<P>
KFI personalities such as Leykis and ultra-conservative mid-morning syndicated 
host Rush Limbaugh are seen by some as sensationalist attention-getters. 
</P>
<P>
But KFI is also touting its renewed focus on local issues, ironically delivered 
by out-of-towners -- on-air personalities from such places as Sacramento, 
Cleveland and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Even KFI's morning weatherman is based in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that dumb?" said Michael Jackson, who has been at KABC for 23 years. "To 
talk about issues that pertain to this country you have to earn your spurs. You 
have to know the issues." 
</P>
<P>
Elmer and Grosby -- whose morning news show interspersed with conversational 
patter is pitted against one of Los Angeles' most highly rated morning teams, 
KABC's Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur -- admit that they are somewhat at a 
disadvantage while still learning the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about being here is there's so much going on all the time," 
Grosby said. "There are a lot more things to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
The pair replaced veteran broadcasters Gary Owens and Al Lohman, because the 
station wanted less joking and conversation and more news, program director 
Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who we replaced here were legends," Grosby said. "You don't replace 
them, you just try to do your own thing and try and be interesting and 
hopefully people will take you on your own merits. . . . We're not really 
trying to follow their act. We're trying to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
Oliva thinks the force of their folksy personalities will eventually draw 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted people that had worked together as a team and were comfortable and 
easy with this sort of presentation, not straight news anchors," Oliva said. 
"These are people that are news professionals that are also people. Their 
personalities are very important to the program. A lot of news anchors are not 
necessarily as facile in that area." 
</P>
<P>
The morning team is a departure from the more controversial personalities heard 
during the day. In mid-morning the archconservative Rush Limbaugh has incited 
the ire of listeners with his "caller abortions" (a vacuum cleaner sound used 
to wipe the caller off the air), his "feminist updates" and "condom updates" as 
well as his scoffing at the plight of the homeless and denunciations of the 
causes of such liberal activist celebrities as Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Toni Grant espouses a traditional non-feminist platform on her 11 
a.m.-to-2 p.m. show, which has drawn criticism from many women. From 3 to 7 
p.m. the strident voice of Tom Leykis can be heard discussing topics ranging 
from "the most disgusting place you've ever put your mouth" to a religious cult 
that worships sex to non-racist skinheads. Leykis drew national attention in 
March when he destroyed Cat Stevens records as a protest against the singer's 
endorsement of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Though they just started a couple weeks ago, the evening newcomers, Mother Love 
and Christopher Bartlett seem to be following in the tradition of Leykis and 
Limbaugh. Mother Love's topics during her first week on the air included 
betrayal, the lighter side of death and "good women, bad marriages." Bartlett's 
topics ranged from sex in the workplace to gang warfare to "how to tell if your 
child is on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
KFI general manager Howard Neal said that before establishing the current 
"issues-oriented" programming format, the station had been plagued by 
directionlessness and a lack of listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"For a number of years the station has groped for a direction," Neal said. "In 
the past couple years, the station has evolved. You could call it changes, but 
I like to call it evolution. It has become what a lot of people have wished 
for." 
</P>
<P>
But KABC personalities point to their established position in the ratings and 
claim that is what listeners are wishing for. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Michael Jackson, who at 55 is perhaps one of the best-known local 
personalities, said he is enjoying the heated competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I am genuinely very pleased that there is an alternative," Jackson said. 
"Without sounding arrogant, it stops you from being complacent and it gives 
people a chance to make a comparison. " 
</P>
<P>
"I believe competition is good for everybody," said Hart (Mother Love). "There 
are enough listeners out there for everybody. . . . I'm not here to try to 
offend anybody. Shake up a few things, yeah, maybe. Get them a little angry, at 
least get them thinking. If they love me, I think that's splendid, if they hate 
me, that also splendid. It sounds strange, but I figure either way I've aroused 
a strong emotion from my listeners. As long as I can arouse some emotion, I'm a 
happy camper."

WHO'S NEXT WHEN ROCK 'N' ROLL VOTES TO INDUCT NEW ARTISTS TO ITS HALL OF FAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Who's three Southern California concerts this week are part of a 25th 
anniversary celebration for the landmark British band that is virtually certain 
to culminate with the group's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
next January in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The question facing the 300 record industry leaders who have been asked to vote 
in this year's selection process: What other rock artists also deserve to join 
the fifth annual Hall of Fame class? 
</P>
<P>
The selection panel -- mostly record company executives, musicians and critics 
-- was given a list of 30 nominees and asked to vote for up to 10 artists. 
Results will be announced in October. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hall of Fame rules, performers become eligible for induction 25 years 
after the release of their first record -- in this case, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The Who is one of five acts on the 1989 ballot that became eligible this year. 
The others: the Animals, the Kinks, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the Yardbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley also appears on the ballot for the first time, but he was eligible 
in 1986 because the reggae champion began his recording carer in Jamaica in 
1961. He didn't appear on earlier ballots because the early records weren't 
brought to the attention of the nominating committee members. Most members had 
assumed his career began with his mid-'60s recordings with the Wailers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other names appearing on this year's ballot for the first time were also 
eligible previously, but didn't receive enough votes in preliminary screening 
sessions to qualify. They are Johnny Cash, Brenda Lee and the Shirelles. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven artists have been on the ballot ever since the Hall of Fame voting was 
begun in 1985, but haven't received enough support to be inducted. They are 
LaVern Baker, Hank Ballard, Ruth Brown, King Curtis, Bobby Darin, Duane Eddy, 
Little Willie John, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Reed, Gene Vincent and Chuck Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Del Shannon was nominated this year for the fourth time, while Solomon Burke, 
the Four Seasons, Gladys Knight and the Platters are on the ballot for the 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Evans, executive director of the Hall of Fame Foundation in New York, 
said the decision on how many artists will be inducted in January will be made 
after looking at the final vote to see if there is a natural dividing point. 
Last year, five record makers were honored: Dion DiMucci, Otis Redding, the 
Rolling Stones, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
While the foundation gives the 300 voters no guidelines for judging Hall of 
Fame qualifications, the balloting so far has shown that the voters lean much 
more heavily toward artists with a strong sense of artistic vision than artists 
who simply registered a lot of hits. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my rating of the 1989 nominees -- with artists listed alphabetically 
within categories. Commentary is provided on artists in the top two categories 
and on artists in other categories who are on the ballot for the first time. 
The others were discussed in previous Hall of Fame handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
The Musts 
</P>
<P>
The Kinks 
</P>
<P>
Stats: 12 Top 40 singles in the United States -- notably "You Really Got Me" 
(1964), "All Day and All of the Night" (1965), "Lola" (1970) and "Come Dancing" 
(1983). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early hits, the Kinks didn't make as big a splash with the 
mainstream pop-rock audience in the mid-'60s as such rival British Invasion 
outfits as Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five. But thanks to Ray Davies' 
songs, the Kinks went on to establish a body of work that far outdistances 
virtually every band from the period save the Beatles, Stones and Who. Davies 
wrote with imagination, passion and wit about social attitudes in England and 
his own frustrations and doubts in rock 'n' roll. Along with Dylan and the 
Beatles/Stones/Who, the Kinks helped establish the album -- rather than the 
single -- as the artistic showpiece in pop. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley 
</P>
<P>
No Top 10 singles, though eight of Marley's albums -- including "Rastaman 
Vibration" (No. 8 in 1976) and "Exodus" (No. 20 in 1977) -- made the Top 100 
album chart in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Marley was called everything from the Bob Dylan of reggae (for the commentary 
and grace in his music) to the Mick Jagger of reggae (for his charisma on 
stage), and both phrases made sense. But Marley's influence went far beyond the 
reggae world. There was a passion and commitment in his music and manner in the 
mid-'70s that helped remind countless rock fans and musicians of what was 
missing for much of the decade in their own music. Marley -- and reggae -- was 
especially influential in England on the Clash and other members of the 
punk/new wave uprising of the late '70s. Marley was 35 when he died of cancer 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Garfunkel 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Top 40 hits -- notably "The Sounds of Silence" (1965), "Mrs. Robinson" 
(1968), "The Boxer " (1969) and "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (1970). 
</P>
<P>
 Some purists will argue that the duo's soft, folk-aligned style wasn't truly 
rock, but Simon &amp; Garfunkel's music brought added breadth and dimension to 
rock. While concentrating on themes of interest to the young rock generation, 
Paul Simon's writing reflected a consciousness of traditional pop craft, 
ultimately helping rock expand its base to the thirtysomething and 
fortysomething audience. 
</P>
<P>
The Who 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Top 40 hits -- notably "I Can See for Miles" (1967), "Pinball Wizard" 
(1969), "See Me, Feel Me" (1970) and "Won't Get Fooled Again" (1971). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the half-dozen greatest rock bands ever, though the current tour -- 
which includes stops Tuesday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, Thursday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre and Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- may 
offer only a distant glimpse of that greatness. The Who never achieved the mass 
acceptance of the Beatles or the Stones during its early and most creative 
years because Pete Townshend didn't write with the same pop sensibilities as 
Lennon/McCartney and Jagger/Richards. But Townshend's early music for the Who 
expressed the energy, insecurities and desires of youth with an integrity and 
force that have rarely been exhibited in any art form. 
</P>
<P>
The Near-Musts 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bobby Darin 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Top 40 hits -- notably "Splish Splash" (1958), "Mack the Knife" 
(1959), "18 Yellow Roses" (1973) and "If I Were a Carpenter" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Darin has been passed over by Hall of Fame voters for four years is 
that he never seemed committed to rock. After breaking into the pop charts with 
a series of rock hits (including "Early in the Morning" and "Queen of the 
Hop"), the ambitious Darin headed quickly for the adult pop market. For all his 
many changes (he also dabbled in country, R&amp;B and folk), Darin was a 
legitimate part of the first rock generation and his vocal authority and 
passion reflected the spirit of the rock experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Four Tops 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Top 40 tunes -- notably "I Can't Help Myself" and "It's the Same Old 
Song" (both 1965), "Reach Out, I'll Be There" (1966) and "Standing in the 
Shadows of Love" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Tops were also passed over last year, partly because the Detroit 
outfit was in the shadow of the Temptations, a more significant vocal group 
that was inducted. However, the Tops' best music -- much of it shaped by the 
team of Holland-Dozier-Holland -- was an integral part of Motown's marvelous 
first decade and an unforgettable part of the pop-rock-soul history of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Ike &amp; Tina Turner 
</P>
<P>
Six Top 40 singles as a team -- notably "A Fool in Love" (1960), "It's Gonna 
Work Out Fine" (1961), "Proud Mary" (1971) and "Nutbush City Limits" (1973). 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Ike &amp; Tina Turner to get into the Hall of Fame last year 
was an even bigger surprise -- and disappointment -- than the Four Tops 
oversight. The duo doesn't have an impressive string of chart hits, but Ike was 
a studio pioneer and Tina's vocal on Phil Spector's recording of "River Deep, 
Mountain High" was among the most spectacular ever in rock. Still, the Turners' 
most memorable contribution to rock was their sizzling live show. 
</P>
<P>
The Yardbirds 
</P>
<P>
Six Top 40 hits -- notably "For Your Love," "Heart Full of Soul" and "I'm a 
Man" (all 1965), "Shapes of Things" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that keeps this English band from the "musts" category is its 
short life span. Before breaking up in 1968, however, the group came up with 
some explosive blues-rock explorations that made an extraordinary impact. The 
Yardbirds not only served as the launching pad for such classic guitar figures 
as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, but they also stimulated an army of 
musicians to move farther along the band's spectacularly original path. Among 
the most notable descendants: Cream and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
Next in Line 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Animals 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Top 40 songs -- notably "The House of the Rising Sun" (1964), "Don't 
Let Me Be Misunderstood" and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" (both 1965) and 
"Don't Bring Me Down" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 Though this British band carried on longer than the Yardbirds, its peak 
creative period was not much longer, one reason it isn't ranked higher. For a 
few electrifying moments in the mid-'60s, however, the Animals looked like as 
much of a contender as the Beatles and the Stones, thanks to a series of 
records that recalled the frightening intensity of the most striking early 
R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Cash 
</P>
<P>
Twelve Top 40 hits -- notably "I Walk the Line" (1956), "Guess Things Happen 
That Way" (1958), "Ring of Fire" (1963) and "A Boy Named Sue" (1969). 
</P>
<P>
 Cash is one of the most important figures in the modern pop era, but he was a 
great country artist whose talent reached over to pop-rock fans rather than 
someone who consciously contributed to rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Shirelles 
</P>
<P>
Eleven Top 40 tunes -- notably "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" (1960), "Dedicated 
to the One I Love" (1961), "Baby It's You" and "Soldier Boy" (both 1962). 
</P>
<P>
 The Shirelles are pretty much just another name today on the long list of 
"girl groups" from the '60s, but their key hits defined the genre more than any 
female group outside the Phil Spector roster and the Supremes. 
</P>
<P>
Previously nominated and evaluated in these pages: Hank Ballard, Booker T. 
&amp; the MGs, the Impressions, Little Willie John, Frankie Lymon, the 
Platters, Gene Vincent and Jimmy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Shot 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brenda Lee 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven Top 40 singles -- notably "Sweet Nothin's" (1959), "I'm Sorry" and 
"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" (both 1960), "Dum Dum" (1961). 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of hits, little lasting impact. 
</P>
<P>
Other previously evaluated holdovers: LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, Solomon Burke, 
King Curtis, Duane Eddy, the Four Seasons, Gene Pitney, Lloyd Price, Del 
Shannon and Chuck Willis.

POP EYE: WARNING STICKERS SEEM TO HYPE ALBUMS' APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being banned in Boston never hurt a book's chances of making the best-seller 
lists, right? It just piques people's interest by making the book seem 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
Some music retailers are saying that the same is true of record albums that 
carry parental advisory stickers. Under pressure from the Parents' Music 
Resource Center, most major record companies agreed two years ago to put 
warning stickers on albums with explicit lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of warning people off, the stickers are often red flags 
</P>
<P>
signaling to customers that the album is racy and provocative. 
</P>
<P>
The top new entries on Billboard magazine's pop album chart for the past two 
weeks have carried stickers warning of explicit lyrics. Both are rap albums: 
the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique" and the D.O.C.'s " No One Can Do It 
Better." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very possible that by stickering, you attract attention and cause a 
frenzy to get the album," said Gary Ross, executive vice president at the 
700-store Musicland chain, based in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for the 50-store Music Plus chain, agreed 
that stickering doesn't inhibit sales. "It probably even helps a little bit 
because it adds a little titillation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the attention the stickers attract is positive. Some department 
stores, including Target and K mart, refuse to stock stickered albums. As a 
result, record companies have to either forfeit those sales or come up with 
alternate versions of albums with the offending language deleted. 
</P>
<P>
At stores carrying both versions, it's no contest -- and really no surprise -- 
which one sells better: the stickered versions. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Lee, director of music buying for the 240-store Wherehouse chain, said 
that the "street version" of LL Cool J's recent Top 10 album, "Walking Like a 
Panther," has outsold the cleaned-up "radio version" by a margin of 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We buy both and make both available, but our customer is telling us they like 
the hard-core version better," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Heller, an executive at Ruthless Records, which released the D.O.C. 
album, agreed that customer response is far greater to the original, stickered 
albums than to the toned-down versions. He based that conclusion on sales last 
spring of N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" and Eazy-E's "Eazy Does It." 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten two negative calls from parents who bought albums not knowing 
that they had explicit lyrics and I've gotten literally hundreds of complaint 
calls from kids who have gotten the watered-down version thinking it was the 
real thing," Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to believe there are more people out there that want the regular 
version than a clean version."

LOVE AND ROCKETS: AGREEING TO DISAGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Ash, one-third of the English band Love and Rockets, entered a trailer 
dressing room at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre before a recent concert and 
squinted severely at the harsh fluorescent lighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't we turn those lights off?" he asked. "It's like a bloody supermarket in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The lights were killed, leaving only a little illumination from a small window 
to keep the room from being completely dark. As Ash settled onto a small sofa, 
David J., who splits Love and Rockets' singing and writing duties with Ash, 
stepped into the room and immediately asked: "Can't we get some light in here? 
It's like a bleeding morgue." 
</P>
<P>
A brief discussion ensued. Ash and J. never actually agreed, but settled on a 
compromise: The light in the room was left off, and a door was opened so light 
from an adjoining room could filter in while Ash and J. expressed conflicting 
opinions on a number of subjects for the next 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That, in essence, is Love and Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The spike-haired Ash -- who is flamboyant enough to don fishnet stockings and a 
mini-dress for the band's encore -- is fairly blunt, sometimes seeming to think 
as he speaks and prone to making sweeping statements in a working-class English 
accent disconcertingly reminiscent of the satirical Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap. 
Bassist J., in contrast, is more reserved and pensive, considering a topic 
before speaking in even, measured tones. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually see eye to eye at the end of the day," explained Ash, who plays 
guitar in addition to singing. "But we like a bit of healthy contrast. 
</P>
<P>
"Us two are very different in many respects and I think we learn from each 
other, really. Particularly on the creative side, there are areas we wouldn't 
indulge in normally, both of us. Because of that, hopefully, the group is a 
more substantial entity through the two or three leanings we have." 
</P>
<P>
I's a contrast mirrored by the audience Love and Rockets attracts. With "So 
Alive" -- the first single from the current "Love and Rockets" album -- making 
Billboard's Top 5 this summer, the trio has reached the level where it can 
headline big arenas such as the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows. (The group 
returns to the Southland, sandwiched between the headlining Cure and the 
opening Pixies, at Dodger Stadium on Sept. 8.) 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Love and Rockets has held on to fans who have been with the 
trio since it was three-fourths of the gloom 'n' doom icon Bauhaus in the early 
'80s, while adding new fans attracted by the hits. The resulting audience -- 
predominantly white teens and young adults -- is the kind usually reserved for 
either a hey-let's-all-party-together band, like Motley Crue, or a 
hey-let's-all-be-alienated-together experience, like the Cure or the Smiths. 
Love and Rockets is neither, but in the Irvine audience it was easy to find 
both extremes represented. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else can flirt with death and bring it back like Love and Rockets," 
said Dave Caspine, 23, during the Irvine concert. "Can't you hear the afterlife 
in their voices? They sing about life and death and being alone." 
</P>
<P>
But right next to him, Eddie Fisher, 20, had a more down-to-earth assessment: 
"I don't know, I just like the rhythms and the beats," he admitted. "I'm not 
too good with lyrics. I don't really understand them unless I know the songs 
real well." 
</P>
<P>
In either case, it's an audience with an average age at least a decade younger 
than the musicians (Ash is 31, J. is 32, and drummer Kevin Haskins -- J.'s 
younger brother -- is 29). 
</P>
<P>
Is it awkward to be speaking to, if not for, a younger generation? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Ash replied. "That's part of rock 'n' roll anyway. It keeps you 
young. It sort of deliberately keeps you at an adolescent stage in a way. It 
lets you act like a kid longer than the usual time you're supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, J. disagreed, interrupting Ash: "No, but it's a more advantaged 
position we're in, because you learn from experience, but we still have 
sympathy for that time of life." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief argument, Ash confessed: "Personally, I don't remember going 
through any big change in my teens. I don't remember that thing that's supposed 
to go on between 15 and 20. Nothing drastic happened to me at that age at all. 
My voice didn't even break or anything." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't spend hours sitting alone in his room, anguishing, as many of his 
young fans certainly do? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but I still do that," Ash said. "That's what I'm saying. I've always 
done that." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ash shrugged off any implied responsibility held in having young 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility? None at all," he said. "If you start worrying about that sort 
of thing, you can miss your own truths." 
</P>
<P>
Added J., "Your responsibility is honesty." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Rockets haven't thought about their relationship with their fans. 
Ever since the Bauhaus days in the early '80s, they've had steady streams of 
encounters with and yearning letters from young fans who take their 
introspective songs very personally. 
</P>
<P>
"We get quite a variety," Ash said. "From strange obsessive letters to very 
interesting letters that can give an insight into the music that really hadn't 
occurred to us." 
</P>
<P>
If not responsibility, they do acknowledge a potential power in their position. 
It's a subject they have addressed in song. 
</P>
<P>
"Swing the Heartache," a newly released collection of BBC radio sessions by 
Bauhaus, includes "Party of the First Part," which features dialogue taken from 
a film presenting stardom as a Faustian exercise. And on the new "Love and 
Rockets" album, the song "Rock and Roll Babylon" presents pop stars as 
tightrope walkers through whom fans vicariously take risks. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody that's in the public eye, people want them to take their chances for 
them," Ash said. "But I wouldn't presume that it's us." 
</P>
<P>
J. again disagreed, saying that the risk-taker's role is indeed something 
relevant to Love and Rockets' relationship with its audience. "But if you're 
aware of it," he said, "then you've already made a move to avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
Ash countered: "But it's not about us. It's observations about the general 
things that go on." 
</P>
<P>
"It beckons, though," J. insisted. "But we recognized it for what it is, so it 
isn't a danger." 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very presumptuous to think we're anywhere near that sort of 
situation where you get into the subject you're talking about," cautioned Ash. 
</P>
<P>
With weary, almost patronizing exasperation, J. insisted to his band-mate, "Oh, 
it happens very early on, in all its insidious forms." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but we've never gotten trapped by that." 
</P>
<P>
Insistently, J. stated: "No we haven't. I know we haven't, because we're aware 
of it. But it happens early on. We could have been led down that path."

POP EYE: AZOFF UPDATE: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The music industry has been rife with rumors that Irving Azoff, chairman of the 
MCA Music Entertainment Group, may be leaving MCA Inc., to form his own record 
company. The most frequently cited sources of funding for such a venture: 
PolyGram and Warner Bros. Records and various forms of independent financing. 
</P>
<P>
But Azoff told Pop Eye last week that he hasn't been talking to anyone but MCA, 
where he has 19 months remaining on his contract. He declined to say whether he 
wants his own record company. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor mill went into overdrive on Aug. 8, when Azoff was not named to MCA's 
board of directors while two other MCA officials -- Tom Pollock, chairman of 
the motion picture group Universal Pictures), and Charles S. Paul, president of 
MCA Enterprises -- were appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff, who assumed the top job at MCA Records in 1983, is credited with turning 
the company from a perennial also-ran into a formidable force. 
</P>
<P>
MCA has enjoyed a string of best-selling albums since 1985, including the 
"Beverly Hills Cop" and "Miami Vice" sound tracks and studio albums by Bobby 
Brown, Boston and Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
But Azoff reportedly desires to once again own his own company. From 1974 to 
1983 he owned and operated the highly successful Front Line Management, where 
he represented such blue-chip clients as the Eagles, Dan Fogelberg, Stevie 
Nicks and Steely Dan. 
</P>
<P>
And Azoff is said to prefer the challenge of building a company to the task of 
maintaining one. Said a source at MCA: "It's been a lot of fun building a 
record label from nothing. But once it's put together, it becomes a 
nine-to-five job." 
</P>
<P>
After denying that he's talking to outsiders, Azoff declined further comment. 
But he added: "I've never worked a nine-to-five."

NOTEBOOK: GOODBY L.A. OLE; HELLO ATLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Tamayo, co-founder of the once super-hot Cha Cha Cha in far southeastern 
Hollywood and also of Cafe Mambo nearby, has a new, large-scale project in the 
works: By mid-October, he will open the Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, where L.A. Ole 
now stands in the Wilshire District's ornate Pellissier Building -- better 
known as the Wiltern. (L.A. Ole remains open, doing business as usual, through 
Aug. 29.) 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo says that the Atlas, which he will run in partnership with the Ratkovich 
Co., owners of the building and of other renovated landmark properties around 
Los Angeles (including the soon-to-open Chapman Market not far from the 
Wiltern), will feature "transcontinental cuisine." That means, he explains "an 
eclectic sort of menu, sort of Californian, but with Latin and Asian flavors." 
Victoria Granof, formerly in the kitchen at Trumps, among other restaurants, 
will be executive chef. Designer Ron Meyer is doing the interior. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Atlas will be primarily a restaurant, Tamayo adds, he also plans to 
present music and comedy performances on an occasional basis. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles," he says, "going out to dinner is the whole evening to most 
people, and most people don't go to clubs afterwards -- so I thought I would 
add that element of entertainment here. I want to make the Atlas a really fun 
sort of venue, with a bit of wit to it -- not a place that will take itself too 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, says Tamayo, who gave up operation of Cha Cha Cha by court order 
after a dispute with his one-time partner, chef Toribio Prado, he will continue 
running Cafe Mambo and his clothing store, Modern Objects. "I own and operate 
both of them," he says. "I also own but don't operate Cha Cha Cha, and I'm not 
sure what will happen there. We are still in litigation." 
</P>
<P>
VIKING FAREWELL?: Another of L.A.'s old classic restaurants, Scandia on Sunset 
Strip, has closed -- at least temporarily. The venerable Danish/Continental 
establishment, once one of the best restaurants in town, has locked its doors 
and left a message on its phone machine saying that it will reopen after Labor 
Day. Sources in the industry, however, say magazine publisher, Robert Petersen, 
plans to sell the restaurant he's owned for more than a decade. More 
conservative Scandia watchers say the restaurant, at the very least, will 
undergo a substantial management change. 
</P>
<P>
CLAWS: "Lobster is never really cheap," says Hans Rockenwagner, proprietor of 
Rockenwagner's in Venice, "but it is most reasonable at this time of year." 
With that in mind, Rockenwagner is now offering, in addition to the regular 
menu, a small menu devoted exclusively to lobster dishes. Among the items 
served are lobster lasagna with a "checkerboard" of pasta, and lobster salad 
with avocado, home-cured tomatoes and spicy walnuts. The lobster menu will 
crawl, er, run until early September at least . . . Meanwhile, also in 
celebration of the current seasonal plentitude of lobster, the Bistrot Terrasse 
at Le Meridien hotel in Newport Beach presents a weekly Maine Lobster Cookout 
every Sunday from 4:30 p.m. The cost is $22 per person, including a grilled 
one-and-a-half pound lobster, Caesar salad, baked potato and corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
HOT STUFF: If you're a spur-of-the-moment kind of chili fan, you'll probably 
want to head right over to the Perkins Palace parking lot in Old Town Pasadena 
for the Pasadena Chili Cook-Off and Antique Car Show '89 -- held today from 11 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Among the participants will be such restaurants as Roxxi, the 
Rose City Diner, the Crocodile Cafe and Johnny Reb's, plus the Pasadena Fire 
Department, Bristol Farms markets and chili expert Layne Wootten. Tickets are 
$7 each, with proceeds going to the Guadalupe Home for Boys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE RECORD: The UCLA Extension Division of Culinary Arts Open House, to be 
held next Saturday, the 26th, begins at 10 a.m., not 10 p.m. as noted in this 
column last Sunday. Call (213) 206-8120 for details.

AVALON'S CURE FOR ITS GROWING PAINS; 
</P>
<P>
15-YEAR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD CHANGE MUCH OF TOWN THAT'S BURSTING AT THE 
SEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By boat, the view approaching Avalon presents a trio of vivid images, each 
rising from the morning mists like a post card come to life. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Hamilton Cove condominiums, tier upon tier of gleaming white 
buildings hewn into a hillside of the rugged Santa Catalina Island terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the landmark Casino Ballroom, a round, domed Art Deco structure, perched 
on a showy vantage point of land jutting into the blue Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, rounding the curve into Avalon Bay, the town itself, exuding Old World 
charm and a Mediterranean-like ambience. Picturesque houses with red-tiled 
roofs line the steep, winding streets, overlooking a white sand beach and the 
boat-filled harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Even ashore, Avalon lives up to its idyllic image. 
</P>
<P>
It is a town where many residents are on a first-name basis, where townspeople 
pick up their mail at the post office because there are too few residents to 
justify the expense of home mail delivery, and where locals often can recite 
their post office box numbers more readily than their street addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Crescent Avenue, a pedestrian mall of souvenir shops and restaurants with 
quaint names like Buoys and Gulls and the Busy Bee, retains a small-town 
flavor, though year-round residents tend to avoid it in summer months because 
of the throngs of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
But even in picture-perfect Avalon, there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Room for Improvements 
</P>
<P>
In surveys conducted over the last year by the Santa Catalina Island Co., 
residents and visitors alike identified a number of ways that life in Avalon 
could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the city of about 2,500 is bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon suffers from a shortage of housing for permanent residents, and would-be 
workers in the year-round tourist industry often have trouble finding a place 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion and a shortage of parking space are critical issues. Even 
though many residents tool around the hilly streets in space-saving golf carts, 
and the city strictly limits the numbers of cars and other vehicles, summer 
traffic often collects in a bottleneck at downtown intersections. 
</P>
<P>
For residents, tourism is both an economic boon and a hindrance to day-to-day 
life. As many as 15,000 tourists from "overtown," as the mainland is called, 
flood the 1.25-square-mile town daily, providing lucrative profits for Avalon 
merchants but straining the town's already taxed freshwater resources, streets 
and sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Headaches 
</P>
<P>
Twice weekly, the tourist tide swells when cruise ships are moored offshore and 
hundreds of vacationers are ferried to the Pleasure Pier for a few hurried 
hours of sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Avalon resident John W. R. Windle, who arrived on the island as a 
6-year-old in 1910, reveres Avalon's small-town charms but says the city's 
growth and its increasing popularity as a year-round tourist attraction cause 
headaches for permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things need fixing, there's no doubt about it," said Windle, 85. "And 
it's getting more commercial, it really is. Sometimes I get to feel like a 
stranger in my own town." 
</P>
<P>
To ease the problems, officials at the Santa Catalina Island Co., which owns 
much of the land in Avalon, have unveiled a sweeping, 15-year plan aimed at 
redeveloping much of the town in three-year phases. 
</P>
<P>
The plan -- still at a conceptual stage -- is intended to address some of the 
most pressing issues facing Avalon, including lack of year-round housing and a 
water supply so limited that salt water is used to flush toilets and to douse 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes new moderate-cost apartments and homes for year-round 
residents; a new transportation center to consolidate ticket-buying and other 
travel functions now spread out over the town; a desalination plant; three new 
hotels with a total of about 200 new rooms, and a general sprucing up of 
Avalon's streets and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Island officials are uncertain how much it will cost to implement the plan and 
how any future development costs will be divided among the Island Co., the city 
and private developers. A desalination plant alone will cost $3 million, 
officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, although acknowledging that the changes are overdue, say they 
want to preserve Avalon's small-town quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought in 1919 
</P>
<P>
Therein, Island Co. officials say, lies a major dilemma: how to upgrade Avalon 
without altering its charm. 
</P>
<P>
"Avalon's now 75 years old, and a lot of the things that were convenient and 
appropriate 75 years ago are no longer convenient and appropriate," said Island 
Co. Vice President Ron Doutt. "They are, as a matter of fact, contributing to 
these problems." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Catalina Island was purchased in 1919 by the family of chewing gum 
magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the Island Co. The company now owns about 
two-thirds of the land in Avalon and about 20% of the city's buildings. In 
1975, the company deeded about 86% of the island to the nonprofit Catalina 
Conservancy, which maintains the pristine interior. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Avalon's buildings date from the early part of the century. City Hall, 
for example, a wood frame, stucco-covered structure built into a steep 
hillside, was constructed around 1917. 
</P>
<P>
The cramped council chambers, with green, plastic-covered benches, hold a 
maximum of 36 people. If a large turnout is expected at a council meeting, the 
location is switched to the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere at City Hall, office space is so limited that some city workers share 
desks in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facilities in 3 Buildings 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Chuck Prince said the city "has facilities strung out over three 
buildings." Offices for the city clerk and the city manager, for example, are 
about a block apart. 
</P>
<P>
"If any of those locations were sufficient, that would be great," Prince said. 
"But they're not. They're old, accessibility's difficult, and there's no 
meeting space. If more than three people want to get together, generally they 
have to borrow space from a local bank." 
</P>
<P>
Space is at an even greater premium at the Avalon fire station, just across 
from City Hall on Metropole Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's unbelievable," said Fire Chief Jack Goslin. "We don't even have a 
ramp to pull out the trucks and work on them." During daily maintenance checks, 
the trucks must be pulled out onto Metropole, partially blocking the 
thoroughfare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems at the station include a leaky roof and living quarters crammed 
into a converted garage under City Hall -- a space about 12 by 22 feet, shared 
by two on-duty firefighters. When an alarm sounds, firefighters must dash 
across the street to get to the fire trucks, Goslin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fumes in Sleeping Quarters 
</P>
<P>
"Right next door to (the living quarters) is where the ambulance is," Goslin 
said. "When you start that up, all the fumes come in to where they sleep." 
</P>
<P>
A new fire station -- proposed for a site on Avalon Canyon Road near the school 
and Avalon Municipal Hospital -- could provide training and classroom space for 
the department's 25 volunteer firefighters, Goslin said. Also, the proposed 
site is more level than the present one, allowing easier access to Avalon's 
main streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see it done," Goslin said. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents have expressed dismay that the plans will take 15 years to 
complete. "It's not fast enough," one resident wrote on an Island Co. survey. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith called the plan "workable and doable" and said he 
supports the Island Co.'s plan to proceed "a step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Island Co. officials say developing the project over 15 years will minimize 
disruption to Avalon's tourists and residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Plans 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for developing over a long term, officials said, is because the 
plans are so massive. The plans call for: 
</P>
<P>
Construction of 50 units of housing a year over 15 years. The additional 
housing is planned for three locations: Las Casitas, the site of a former 
bungalow-style hotel where the Chicago Cubs held spring training until 1951, 
now used for housing of Island Co. employees; Bird Park Canyon, the site of a 
former aviary, once the home of a private collection of exotic birds, and Quail 
Canyon, on the outskirts of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a civic center, including a new City Hall, fire station and 
day-care facilities for children, to be built on part of the seven-acre Las 
Casitas site. 
</P>
<P>
While the new housing is being built, a desalination plant will be under 
construction near the Southern California Edison power plant on Pebbly Beach 
Road to provide a source of fresh water for new homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Three new hotels, including a high-quality hotel and public-access beach at 
Descanso Bay, a 16-acre site between the Casino Ballroom and the Hamilton Cove 
condominium development. A second hotel would be built near a city park at the 
west end of Crescent Avenue, the town's main street. Also, the Atwater Hotel 
would be razed and a new hotel built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
A plan that would make land owned by the Island Co. available for lease and 
eventual purchase by permanent residents to build single-family homes. Island 
officials said the plan is new and that they are still unsure how it will work. 
</P>
<P>
A central commercial area for residents, to include a new 15,000-square-foot 
grocery store and a new post office, providing a location for residents to shop 
and check their mail away from the onslaught of visitors on tourist-crammed 
Crescent Avenue. Nearby would be a "transportation hub," where tourists would 
validate cross-channel transportation tickets, check in baggage and purchase 
tickets for tours into the interior. Such arrangements are now done at various 
locations, including Cabrillo Mole on Pebbly Beach Road and the Island Plaza on 
Sumner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing traffic by relocating many service-oriented businesses away from 
tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
General sprucing up of the city's parks, possibly adding landscaping along 
Sumner and Metropole avenues, based on the same architectural theme as the 
pedestrian mall on Crescent Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$8-Million Annual Budget 
</P>
<P>
Island Co. officials said it is difficult to estimate how much the new 
developments could bring the city in revenue from hotel and business taxes, but 
one official ventured a rough estimate of $1.7 million annually, when all the 
projects are completed. Avalon's current annual budget is about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of the plan have been in the works for at least 20 years, said 
lifelong Avalon resident Malcolm Renton, a retired vice president of the Island 
Co. For example, building a grand hotel at Descanso Beach has been the 
company's goal since the St. Catherine Hotel, an elegant structure where 
Hollywood stars including Clark Gable, Mary Pickford and Cecil B. De Mille once 
stayed, was razed in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was always to keep that a choice hotel location," said Renton, 81, 
whose father also worked for the Island Co. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Island Co. presented conceptual plans to residents at a town 
meeting, and reaction was mostly favorable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
41% Approved Unconditionally 
</P>
<P>
Of 67 residents who responded to an Island Co. survey after the presentation, 
25 residents, or about 41%, unconditionally approved the overall concept. Only 
two residents didn't like the plan. More meetings are planned over the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, residents seem confident that the plan will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful setup," said Lolo Saldana, owner of Lolo's Plaza Barber Shop 
on Sumner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely impressed with it," said Lita Mulvihill, an Avalon resident for 
17 years, who said the plan "is renovating and restoring and bringing things 
back to life that used to be, like the old St. Catherine." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber is unlikely to take a formal position on the Island Co. plans. But 
Griffin said he approves of the plans and the Island Co.'s solicitation of 
response from the town. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was great," Griffin said. "They're being very up front about what 
they're doing and asking people what they think. It's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Due for an Uplift' 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Moore, director and curator of the Catalina Island Museum, said the 
timing couldn't be better. "I think our town needs to take a good hard look at 
ourselves because we're outgrowing ourselves," she said. "I think we're due for 
an uplift." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing off the development plan hinges largely on one crucial element: water. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we can't build any of these projects without water," said island 
spokesman Doutt. "We've reached our maximum at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Southern California Edison supplies Catalina consumers with about 
300,000 gallons of fresh water daily during the winter and more than a million 
gallons during the summer, officials said. The island's main freshwater source 
is Middle Ranch Reservoir in the interior, which collects rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, which has an 1,143 acre-foot capacity, is currently at about 635 
acre-feet, said Keith LeFever, Edison district manager for Catalina. An 
acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
When the water supply drops to 600 acre-feet -- which could happen in 
mid-September, according to LeFever -- water restrictions will be imposed, 
including restricting the use of water for washing streets, cars and boats and 
watering lawns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flash Distillation 
</P>
<P>
To get enough water to carry out their development plans, island officials hope 
to use a desalination method known as flash distillation, which involves 
condensing seawater to remove the salt, company spokesman Doutt said. 
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study of a desalination plant, commissioned by the Island Co., is 
about 90% completed, LeFever said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing right now is reviewing the different desalination 
alternatives to determine what will be the most cost-effective for them to 
pursue," LeFever said. 
</P>
<P>
Another desalination plant, using reverse osmosis technology to filter 
impurities from the water, is scheduled for construction at Hamilton Cove 
within the next year, LeFever said. 
</P>
<P>
For some residents, a more immediate problem is housing -- or the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon officials have attempted to alleviate the problem with such measures as 
a 1981 city ordinance requiring new hotel developers to provide housing for 50% 
of the people they employ during the peak summer season, and residential 
developers to make 20% of their units available for low- and moderate-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Obstacle 
</P>
<P>
Still, finding an apartment remains a major obstacle for would-be islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the (rental) vacancy rate is zero," City Manager Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year the situation gets worse," said five-year resident Ann Marshall. 
Residents who find a job in Avalon but can't find a place to live soon 
discover, Marshall said, that "you don't always get a warm welcome when you 
come to Catalina." 
</P>
<P>
The housing shortage is so severe, said Marshall, that "some people read the 
obits to see who died, just to see what apartment is coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling her own difficulties finding housing when she moved to Avalon, 
Marshall who is the city's director of community services, said she "bends over 
backward" to help new city employees in search of housing, sometimes letting 
them stay at her two-bedroom apartment for a few days, sleeping on the sofa or 
camping out on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Mulvihill, who owns a women's clothing store, said many business owners -- 
herself included -- work short-handed during the busy summer season because 
potential employees can't find housing. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have just suffered," Mulvihill said. "We don't have a choice of 
employees. We don't have young people coming (to work) in the summer like we 
used to, the college kids. There's no place for them to live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daily Visits to Post Office 
</P>
<P>
The Post Office Arcade is another point of concern for some residents. Because 
mail is not delivered to homes, a daily visit to the Post Office Arcade is a 
necessity -- and often a pleasure -- of life in Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents want it to stay where it is. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I don't think there's a necessity for moving it and a lot of 
people don't that I talk to," said longtime resident Windle. 
</P>
<P>
But others, including postmaster Lydia Saldana, are ready for a bigger, better 
postal facility. The present building dates from the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely we need a new post office," Saldana said. "This one's a little old, 
and with the planned growth we'll need a few more boxes." About 1,800 of the 
facility's 2,000 boxes are currently rented, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Island Co. official Doutt said the old post office building -- part of the 
Atwater Hotel complex -- will be demolished in the last phase of the plan, but 
that the company hopes to recapture some of its flavor in the architectural 
design of the new postal facility and commercial complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Small-Town Feel' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to preserve the feel of the arcade," Doutt said. "You go in there and 
you buy your PTA raffle tickets and you buy your Girl Scout cookies and you 
socialize and get your mail and get caught up on how families are. It's really 
a neat small-town feel." 
</P>
<P>
The new post office arcade will be located near the new grocery store and other 
service-oriented businesses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents questioned how much the plan will cost and who will pay for 
what. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the city afford it?" one anonymous resident asked on the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what all of this would cost," said island spokesman Doutt. 
"We're not even close to breaking ground on any of this." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Prince said a new City Hall "is going to require substantial 
(financial) commitment from the city. Today, we don't have the financial 
resources. . . . Three to five years down the road, we may." 
</P>
<P>
One option, Prince said, is seeking voter approval for a general obligation 
bond to finance a new City Hall. The City Hall site -- which is owned by the 
city -- itself presents another option: The building sits on valuable 
commercial property that could be sold to help finance the cost of a new 
building on a less expensive site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Value Cited 
</P>
<P>
How the City Hall building will be used after a new one is constructed remains 
undecided, Mayor Smith said. Many residents may want to keep the building 
intact because "there's a lot of historical value associated with the present 
City Hall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have held preliminary discussions with the Island Co. and hope 
to have worked out a development agreement by the fall of 1990, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a long, far-reaching document," Prince said, "but probably the 
best way to deal with this would be in a long development agreement that 
undoubtedly . . . would be amended many times" over time. 
</P>
<P>
The city's role in that process would remain unchanged whether the individual 
projects are done by the Island Co. or independent developers, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"The process is the same with respect to evaluation of the project and making 
sure it conforms to Coastal Commission requirements and (city) planning 
ordinances," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Island Co. President Paxson (Packy) Offield said the plan "is going to have to 
be reviewed in an environmental impact study, (and) impacts to the 
infrastructure will have to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Development in Phases 
</P>
<P>
Once a development agreement is reached, island officials envision a phased 
plan that, during the first three years, would see construction begin on 
employee housing and the desalination plant, land would be made available for 
lease purchase, and construction of the hotel at Descanso Beach would begin. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of a new City Hall, fire department, more employee housing and 
more hotels would begin in later phases. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the island company's ambitious plans, optimism for Avalon's future 
is running high among townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted that they're looking at their property from the point of view of 
how we all can benefit," said museum curator Patricia Moore. "It will certainly 
change the town, but generally speaking, I think it will change it for the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, islanders say, the pleasures of life in Avalon more than make 
up for any shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of a better place to live and work, and, if you're going to have 
problems, to have them," said Mulvihill. "I'm sure there are very few places 
like Avalon. Our world is wonderful over here."

TORRANCE CONSIDERS STRICTER LIMITS ON THE SIZE OF HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of public hearings, the Torrance City Council on Tuesday will 
consider a new set of building standards to limit the size of single-family 
houses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards are similar to, but somewhat stricter than, temporary 
controls adopted by the council in May. The proposal would limit the floor area 
of a house relative to lot size, set a new height limit for single-story 
houses, establish new side and rear setback requirements, and limit the 
percentage of the lot that a house can occupy. 
</P>
<P>
The search for new standards was prompted by complaints from dozens of 
residents who said oversized single-family houses being built throughout the 
city are increasing density and traffic and encroaching on neighbors' privacy, 
views and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents have applauded the city for considering stricter 
standards, several builders said the proposed limits are too restrictive and 
will hurt their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance has about 32,000 single-family homes on lots totaling 4,043 acres. 
About 38% of the city is zoned for single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Burrescia, a builder in Torrance since 1971 who has attended some of the 
hearings, said the proposed standards are too restrictive and would force 
developers and builders to take their business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As did several other builders, he said he thinks the city is acting in haste to 
implement arbitrary limits. 
</P>
<P>
"The restrictions are being created more by emotion than a professional 
approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners, such as Mary Papavasiliou, a 20-year resident of Torrance and 
a member of the Seaside Homeowners Assn., say the building standards are needed 
to ensure that single-family houses in Torrance do not have a negative effect 
on adjacent neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she understands the concerns expressed by builders but that the 
city needs to address the problem of oversized single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I see their side," she said. "But I don't want the city to look the way 
(builders) want it to look." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Affect Existing Homes 
</P>
<P>
The recommended standards will not affect existing homes but will have an 
impact on new houses, additions and houses that are remodeled. If the standards 
are adopted, the City Council will decide Tuesday whether to exempt all 
construction plans for single-family houses that are currently being reviewed 
by the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
In order to control the size of two-story houses, the recommendations would 
limit the floor area to 60% of the lot area. The proposal includes garages as 
part of the floor area but excludes basements. 
</P>
<P>
The average single-family lot in the city is between 5,000 and 6,000 square 
feet, city officials said. Under the proposed limit, a house on a lot of 5,000 
square feet can have no more than 3,000 square feet of floor area. A house on a 
6,000-square-foot lot can have no more than 3,600 square feet of floor area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow a floor area of up to 70% of the lot area if the 
side-yard setback is increased. A minimum side-yard setback of 10% of the lot 
width, or at least three feet, is required under current restrictions and would 
remain the same under the proposed standards. 
</P>
<P>
To exceed the proposed limit, a builder must increase the minimum side-yard 
setbacks to 20% of the lot width for the second story or 15% for both the first 
and second stories. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, houses exceeding the limit must also conform to a new "bulk 
control" measure. It requires that no portion of the house protrude outside an 
invisible "tent" that rises vertically 21 feet at the minimum side-yard setback 
and extends at a 45-degree angle toward the interior of the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Size Control Measure 
</P>
<P>
The concept has been used as a size control measure in Palo Alto and Santa 
Monica, according to Principal Planner Patricia Bluman. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also establishes new requirements for back-yard setbacks: an 
average of 15 feet, with a minimum of 10 feet, for single-story houses, and an 
average of 20 feet or a minimum of 15 feet for second-story additions. The 
back-yard setbacks for two-story houses would remain at the current average of 
20 feet or minimum of 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Front-yard setbacks will remain the same as now required: an average of 20 
feet, with a minimum of 15 feet for both one- and two-story houses. 
</P>
<P>
Under current regulations, the height of all single-family houses is limited to 
27 feet. The new standards would set limits of 18 feet for one-story houses and 
27 feet for two-story houses. 
</P>
<P>
The standards would also require that the base of a new two-story house cover 
no more than 40% of the lot. The current limit for lot coverage is 50%. Under 
the proposed standards, the lot coverage limit of 50% for one-story houses and 
second-story additions would remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
Bluman said the 40% lot coverage requirement would ensure that more open space 
is provided around the house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detached Structures Prohibited 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards would also prohibit single-family detached guest houses, 
outdoor staircases and detached, two-story accessory buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the City Council approved an emergency ordinance limiting new 
single-family homes to a floor area of no more than 60% of the lot area. The 
ordinance also applies to additions or modifications. Up to 400 square feet of 
the garage area can be excluded from the floor area. 
</P>
<P>
That ordinance was adopted as a temporary limit until the city enacts permanent 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Burrescia said that the emergency limits were fair and that he would not oppose 
the new standards if the floor area limit also excluded 400 square feet for the 
garage. He said that without the extra garage area, builders will make smaller 
garages, forcing owners of new single-family houses to park in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Bluman, who has been instrumental in developing the proposed standards, said 
the limits are reasonable and are intended to satisfy the concerns of residents 
and builders. 
</P>
<P>
She said that developing the standards was "difficult because we were trying to 
balance the concerns of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developed Over Six Months 
</P>
<P>
The recommended standards have been developed over the last six months and 
discussed at six public hearings where city planning officials heard testimony 
from residents, developers and real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials said they also studied the building limits imposed in 
cities throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Although builders say the proposed standards will hurt their businesses, Bluman 
said that the market for new single-family houses in Torrance is strong and 
that "it would surprise me if it truly turned away the developers." 
</P>
<P>
Tom May, a builder in Torrance for 2 1/2 years, disagrees. He said the proposed 
limits have made him contemplate moving his business. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year is really up in the air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the sentiments of several builders, May said that new-home buyers are 
requesting large two-story houses with two-car garages and that the proposed 
limits would make building such houses difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sad Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad situation," said Judy Trombertta, who owns Judy T Escrow Co. in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
She said the limits could ultimately hurt homeowners who will someday want to 
sell their single-family houses. Homeowners may find that builders, developers 
and real estate brokers will be reluctant to buy older, smaller houses because 
the proposed standards would prevent tearing them down to build larger houses, 
Trombertta said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those concerns, Bob Billett, president of the Southwood Homeowners 
Assn., said he believes the market for single-family houses in Torrance will 
continue to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
Billett, who has also expressed his views at some of the hearings, supports the 
proposed standards, saying, "I think the city is certainly going in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council this week will consider new construction guidelines 
for single-family houses. Drawings show setbacks and height limits set by 
guidelines. Maximum lot coverage for the one-story home and a home with a 
second-story addition is 50%, 
</P>
<P>
or 2,500 square feet for lot size shown. Maximum lot coverage for a new 
two-story home or one with significant remodeling would be 40%, or 2,000 square 
feet for the lot illustrated.

MOBIL ASKED TO HOLD REFINERY OPEN HOUSE SOMEPLACE ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Torrance has decided to play party pooper for open house 
festivities Mobil Oil Corp. hoped would draw 12,000 people to its refinery on 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The oil company -- which is being sued by Torrance over hazards at the refinery 
-- was planning to spend up to $200,000 for jugglers, clowns, hot dogs, 
hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, informational booths and bus tours of 
the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter released Friday, the city expressed concern about safety at the 
plant and suggested that Mobil hold its "public relations" event at a large 
city park. City officials in interviews Friday stopped short of saying they 
would flatly ban the party or refuse to issue permits for it. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials responded to the city in a short, sharp press release late 
Friday. Noting that the city reacted after only brief talks with refinery 
officials, Mobil said "the city's letter amounts to a blanket rejection of our 
plans without any consideration of what they might be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Rights Cited 
</P>
<P>
Mobil declared: "Our plant is safe." It said the city's "unlawful and unfair" 
action would deny the company "its constitutional rights of assembly, free 
speech, equal protection and due process of law." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Barry Engelberg said company officials had received the city's letter 
Friday and had not decided whether to go ahead with plans for the open house or 
whether Mobil would try to force the city to issue permits for the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
The city and Mobil already are embroiled in legal and political disputes on 
several fronts. In April, the city sued Mobil, seeking to have the refinery 
declared a public nuisance subject to city regulation. The oil company 
countersued, saying the refinery is safe. 
</P>
<P>
In July and August, the city also filed criminal misdemeanor charges against 
Mobil, several of its officials and subcontractors as a result of accidents 
that happened in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And in March, 1990, Torrance voters will decide a ballot initiative that would 
effectively eliminate the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid at the 
plant. Mobil officials estimate that the measure would cost the refinery from 
$50 million to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The existing disputes played a role in each sides' actions. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Ken Nelson said Friday that the city's lawsuit might be harmed if 
the permits for the open house were issued, because the action could be 
interpreted as indicating that the city considers the refinery safe. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city has limited grounds on which to refuse some permits, such as 
those needed for erecting a tent or stringing electric lights for 
entertainment, Nelson said Mobil might be able to force their issuance in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"We would just as soon not fight over the fact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Seek Stipulation 
</P>
<P>
If pressed, Nelson said, Torrance might seek a stipulation from Mobil that 
approval of the permits in no way addresses the safety issues at the core of 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
And Mobil, which has said previously that the reason for the party is to polish 
the refinery's image, accused the city of being hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
The Mobil statement noted that the city has "criticized Mobil for being 
non-communicative with its neighbors," but now that there is "a real 
opportunity . . . to have an informal exchange of ideas with its neighbors, the 
city has said 'NO.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Our proposal to stage an open house at our facility creates no risk to our 
neighbors who would attend," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they learned of the Mobil open house proposal in a July 25 
letter from Mobil seeking city assistance for crowd and traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to Refinery Manager 
</P>
<P>
The city's response came in a letter dated Wednesday, from Assistant City 
Manager Albert Ng to Refinery Manager Wyman Robb. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Ng wrote: "It is understandable that Mobil Oil would want to have an 
event such as this, and it makes sense that the positive public relations would 
be important to the corporation at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it is the feeling of the city of Torrance that it is inappropriate to 
have such a large public assembly at the refinery in light of the safety 
concerns which have been expressed over the past several years. Furthermore, it 
seems particularly unwise for the city to issue permits for the planned 
activity based on these concerns."

REDONDO WILL PAY $50,000 TO MOVE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council, reacting to an application to demolish the 
Queen Anne Cottage on South Broadway, has agreed to pay the estimated $50,000 
cost of moving it to Dominguez Park, where the city hopes to establish a 
"Heritage Court." 
</P>
<P>
City officials were urged by council members to make haste in making 
arrangements, since the cottage is destined for demolition to make way for a 
two-unit condominium project. The property owner, Dan Murillo, agreed to delay 
the razing for up to 60 days, said City Manager Tim Casey. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the city moved another historic building, the Morrell House, from 
North Catalina Street to the Perry Allison Playfield in North Redondo Beach. 
However, when nearby residents protested that they didn't want their 
neighborhood play field used for that purpose, the council decided on the 
Dominguez Park location. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Morrell House nor the Queen Anne Cottage can be moved to Dominguez 
Park until the Planning Commission issues a special-use permit. The matter is 
scheduled for a public hearing Sept. 7.

COUNCIL MISSES DEADLINE FOR BALLOT ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council missed the city clerk's Wednesday deadline for filing 
ballot arguments on four city measures to be decided by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
Because they missed the cutoff date, council members will not be able to 
present their views on the measures, which they placed on the Nov. 7 ballot 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3, the council voted unanimously to put on the ballot three measures 
designed to clear up confusion over the validity of the city's General Plan. 
They approved, 4 to 1, a fourth measure, which would allow the city to accept 
large federal or state grants to finance public projects without voter 
approval. Councilman Harold E. Hofmann opposed that measure. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's council meeting, Councilwoman Carol Norman said she is 
disappointed that council members will not have an opportunity to write ballot 
arguments on their measures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought Council Had Time 
</P>
<P>
Norman said that because items relating to the measures were on Thursday's 
agenda, she had assumed the council still had time to draft its arguments for 
the ballot. She said she went out of town for the weekend without opening a 
letter notifying her of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Norman's comments, City Clerk Neil K. Roth would not budge from the 
deadline. He said he had posted it at City Hall and sent notification letters 
to the homes of the five council members on Aug. 10 "as a courtesy." "Everyone 
had an equal opportunity to respond," he said during a break in Thursday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. David J. Aleshire acknowledged that setting the deadline is entirely 
up to Roth. It is "completely within the discretion of the city clerk," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire will write an impartial analysis of each of the measures, and 
opposition arguments have been filed against the measures, including one 
co-authored by Hofmann. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting, developer Jonathan Stein objected loudly to Roth's 
deadline. He said he heads a 488-member homeowner group that "had no idea the 
election deadline had come and gone. The election is not until November." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Example of Arrogance' 
</P>
<P>
Stein called Roth's holding to the deadline "another example of the arrogance 
and insensitivity of city government" and said the council should order the 
city attorney to draft a resolution extending the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy J. Marthens, however, said that she and other residents made it their 
business to find out when the deadline for the ballot statements were, and to 
meet it. "If you are interested in these things you can respond (on time)," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And Hofmann commented that since deadlines were set, "we have to live with 
them." Hofmann, acting as a private citizen, co-signed with four other 
residents the argument against the financing measure. He said he did not sign 
as a councilman because, under state law, this would have precluded other 
residents from submitting arguments on the same side. 
</P>
<P>
Activists Marthens, Herman Weinstein, Virginia Rhodes and Steve Mino joined 
Hofmann in the argument against the financing measure. Marthens, Weinstein, 
Rhodes and Mino also opposed the three General Plan measures. 
</P>
<P>
The financing measure would allow the city to take advantage of federal or 
other outside funding to build public facilities costing more than $1 million. 
A 1987 initiative, enacted by a 3-1 margin, requires the city to obtain voter 
approval for public projects costing more than $1 million. The proposed measure 
would allow the city to exceed that figure as long as the amount in excess of

Attempt to Resolve Confusion 
</P>
<P>
The other three measures attempt to resolve confusion over Ordinance 82 and the 
city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinance 82, a successful 1963 initiative, required the city to obtain voter 
approval for the General Plan. The ordinance was deemed unconstitutional in a 
1974 state attorney general's opinion, so the council adopted the plan in 1976 
without a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the attorney general's office reviewed the case and found the 
1974 opinion erroneous, throwing the legality of the city's General Plan into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
One of the measures on the ballot would repeal Ordinance 82; another would 
amend it to include major amendments to the General Plan, and a third asks 
voters to decide whether to approve the 1976 General Plan.

SHORE PROJECT FOR WILMINGTON GAINS BACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners last week said 
they will press their colleagues to set aside additional land for waterfront 
development in Wilmington -- although both stopped short of saying the 
development should include the Heinz Petfood cannery. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Floyd Clay and Robert Rados made their remarks after touring the 
cannery, which is to close Sept. 1. Wilmington leaders want to convert the 
71-year-old cannery building into a restaurant and include it in their plans 
for a community-oriented recreational and commercial development along the 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rados is against the restaurant proposal and Clay said he is not 
convinced that it can work, both commissioners said they believe the port ought 
to spare some additional land to make the public-access project work. The 
Harbor Department has designated 29 acres for community access, but only a 
small portion is along the water. 
</P>
<P>
Rados said he would like the land occupied by the cannery's loading dock, which 
fronts the water, included in the development. "If we can get that, I'd be real 
happy," he said.

4 COACHES WHO HAVE TOUGH ACTS TO FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NELSON, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget Jimmy Johnson, Barry Switzer, Jackie Sherrill and Vince Dooley. That, 
says a man who should know, is the wisest course of action for Dennis Erickson, 
Gary Gibbs, R.C. Slocum and Ray Goff. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go in worried about who you're following, you're in trouble right off 
the bat," said Ray Perkins, who followed the storied Bear Bryant as Alabama 
football coach in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're well organized, know what's expected of them and work hard, they 
can be successful. Then, I don't think they have to worry about the shadow." 
</P>
<P>
At four major football universities, the shadow looms bigger than life this 
season. Four of the nation's most high-profile coaches are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson left Miami to take over as coach of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. Switzer, 
at Oklahoma, and Sherrill, at Texas A&amp;M, left programs under siege by 
allegations of cheating. And Dooley retired after 25 years at Georgia, 
partially to make a shortlived run at the state's governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson replaced Johnson after two years at Washington State. The other three 
-- Gibbs at Oklahoma, Slocum at Texas A&amp;M and Goff at Georgia -- were 
assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an inkling of what was coming," Erickson said. "Expectations are 
extremely high. Losing is an unheard of word around here, and anytime you 
follow a successful coach like Jimmy, that's what you expect." 
</P>
<P>
Also expect resistance to change, endless comparisons and wave after wave of 
boosters and alumni with their own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was highly criticized for certain changes, changes that I felt needed to be 
made," said Perkins, who left Alabama after the 1986 season and now coaches the 
NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. "I was there to do a job and do it the best way I 
knew how. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some changes. I didn't go to cocktail parties with certain people," he 
said. "I was criticized for that, but I wasn't a drinker and I had better 
things to do. I think everybody expected me to come in there and keep 
everything the same. It was said, 'He should have kept everything the same."' 
</P>
<P>
Not only is that not always possible, it's often not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot of boosters, alumni and other people involved who aren't 
actually a part of the team," Erickson said. "There's a lot of 'coaches' in a 
lot of places. I think that's one of their favorite pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always going to happen," he said. "When you take over a program that's 
been successful and done the right way, people want to see if you do it the 
right way because they want it to remain successful. But everybody is 
different, and there are a lot of different ways to do things right." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs was a player under Switzer, then an assistant coach. Like Slocum and 
Goff, Gibbs does not have to deal with a recognition problem at the school. The 
team's fans and the school's alumni know him. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought about replacing coach Switzer or anything of that nature," he 
said. "I'm Gary Gibbs and I'll be Gary Gibbs, and I'm not going to try to be 
anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs and Slocum have a common problem that probably surmounts any caused by a 
well-known predecessor. Both schools' football programs were charged with 
cheating and stung by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really would like," Slocum said, "is for us to have a program at 
A&amp;M that, No. 1, is respected as a program with integrity, and, No. 2, is a 
program recognized as being well coached by myself and my staff. If we can do 
that, all the rest will take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We won three conference titles in a row with coach Sherrill. I don't have 
anything on my mind like having to win three in a row. I haven't done that to 
myself, my coaches or anybody. We'll do things the right way." 
</P>
<P>
The transition at Georgia has been relatively smooth for Goff. Still, there 
can't help but be problems when you replace a man popular enough to be 
considered a candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Dooley was here for 25 years, and he built up a lot of relations with 
people as far as speaking and going places, and when you step in the first 
year, people expect you to assume all the things he's done," Goff said. "I've 
had to limit myself in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
Following a coach like Dooley can be a two-edged sword, although sometimes the 
blade is a little sharper on one side than the other. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is, things have been going well here, and we just need to carry 
on the tradition," Goff said. "The bad part is if you don't oil it right and it 
slips, people want to know why." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened to Perkins. The Tide went 8-4 in his first season -- not 
good enough by Alabama standards -- then fell to 5-6 the following year for 
their first losing record since 1957. The world had come to an end for fans of 
the Tide. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition is not complete until you go through a season," Erickson said, 
"and it will be complete at Miami when we finish this 1989 season." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Perkins got Alabama going in the right direction again with a 9-2-1 
record and a 24-3 victory over Southern Cal in the Aloha Bowl. In Perkins' last 
season, Alabama went 10-3 and beat Washington 28-6 in the Sun Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"At a place like Alabama or Oklahoma, where there have been two or three, or 
even just one coach that really sets the groundwork for a great tradition, I 
believe the school and the tradition makes the coach," Perkins said. "The 
tradition is already there. Hey, it's hard for somebody to go to an Alabama 
and, if they work hard, not be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs agrees. It should work the same way at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a program becomes successful because of the efforts of one man," 
Gibbs said. "What we have here is a great program. Sure, there a lot of 
expectations, but we have those same expectations."

STREAK PUTS RIPKEN IN RIGHTFUL PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
ORIOLE MAKES HIS MARK IN BASEBALL HISTORY DESPITE CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has spent more than seven seasons downplaying the idea that going to work 
every day is unusual. But Thursday night, after showing up 1,207 straight 
times, Cal Ripken's remarkable consecutive-game streak took on historical 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
When he took the field against the Toronto Blue Jays at Memorial Stadium, 
Ripken didn't set a record, but he established a baseball endurance standard 
unequaled in the last half century. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Lou Gehrig's incredible 2,130 consecutive-game record ended 50 years 
ago has there been a streak of this duration. With Thursday night's game, 
Ripken moved past Steve Garvey into third place on baseball's all-time list, 
leaving only Everett Scott -- and 922 games -- between him and Gehrig. Scott 
played in 1,307 straight contests, between 1916 and 1925. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a couple of us know what it's like to have a streak of this length," 
Garvey said from San Diego, where he conducts a daily radio talk show. "It says 
something about the commitment of the player, not only to the game, but to the 
fans, because they are the ones we play the game for. Cal has certainly done 
that; he's made a statement for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta outfielder Dale Murphy, who held the longest active streak at 740 
before he sat down three years ago, had lost track of Ripken's streak. He 
expressed awe and amazement that the Orioles' perennial All-Star shortstop was 
about to climb into third place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," said Murphy, when informed that Ripken was on the verge of passing 
Garvey. "I couldn't do it. It didn't work out for me, I needed time off. I was 
at the point where it was just enough to be a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Cal's has gone on long enough that it's not a novelty any more. What 
are you going to do, ask him about it every day?" said Murphy, who admitted 
that the streak became a distraction to him. "But I can't say it is for Cal. 
It's bad when it gets to the point where you play even if you can't help the 
team -- but I know that's not the way Cal is, which makes what he's done even 
more remarkable. My situation was, when I wasn't hitting, I needed a day off, 
just like anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the advisability of Ripken's streak has subsided considerably 
since his streak of 8,243 consecutive innings was stopped two years ago, when 
his father, Cal Ripken Sr., the Orioles' manager at the time, decided it was 
creating too much attention. But there will always be some who insist The 
Streak curtails Ripken's offensive production, just as there will always be 
those who feel he should be playing third base instead of shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken long ago learned to explain his durability by insisting his string of 
games was nothing more than a series of 162-game streaks. "Once a season ends, 
it has no bearing on what happens the following year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at it, I'm proud of the fact that I've done it," he said, "not because 
of the number of games, but because I can be counted on to play on a daily 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us is supposed to do an individual job, but at the same time each of 
us is counting on others to do their jobs. If you can't pull your weight ... I 
think I'll be smart enough not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken tries to keep all phases of the game in perspective at all times, and 
that includes The Streak and whatever effect it has on his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty analytical person," he said, "and I read things like Rick Dempsey 
saying I'd be more productive if I took some time off. Maybe that would be, we 
don't know, but how does that translate to the team? Maybe my stats would be 
better, but would the team be any better? 
</P>
<P>
"I get as much enjoyment out of turning a double play to help hold a lead as I 
do from hitting a home run," said Ripken. "You don't have stats to back it up, 
but perhaps I can still have a stabilizing influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Selfishly, perhaps, my numbers might be a little better if I took some time 
off, but I prefer to dwell on the positive things." 
</P>
<P>
Since his first full season with the Orioles in 1982, Ripken has been asked 
only once if he wanted to sit out a few days. "Joe Altobelli asked me after we 
clinched the division in 1983, but I was going so good at the time I didn't 
want to disrupt anything," said Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour after the Orioles had won the World Series that year, Altobelli 
went to Ripken, draped his arm around his shoulder and said, "Cal, we're not 
going to go through that again." But the next year, under Altobelli, Ripken 
played every inning. 
</P>
<P>
The following year The Streak started to take on significance and was 
threatened for the only time since it began on May 30, 1982. In the second game 
of the season, Ripken sprained an ankle and it appeared almost certain he would 
miss time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Wednesday afternoon game," he said, "I can remember that very 
clearly. The next day was an off day and we were going to play the Naval 
Academy, and the next game wasn't until Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Ripken, who turns 29 next Thursday, recovered and it wasn't until 
1987 that his streak of consecutive innings was halted, as much to stem the 
publicity as anything else. "That just started out as a note, but it kept 
getting magnified," said Ripken. "The trouble with innings is you play them 
nine at a time and it doesn't take long for them to get into the thousands." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't enthralled with the idea of sitting down then (he's missed only 26 of 
the last 11,996 innings the Orioles have played), and still doesn't prefer to 
be idle, but he admits that attention over The Streak has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Frank Robinson "has asked me a couple of times if I wanted to come out 
(of a game)," said Ripken. "But when you're going good you don't want to stop 
because you're afraid you'll lose it, and when you're going bad, you figure you 
might get it going again. 
</P>
<P>
"The blowouts are the only real time you have to experiment," he explained. "If 
the experiment works, then you leave the game with a good feeling. If it 
doesn't work, it's no big deal because things weren't good to start with." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken made up his mind early that he would do whatever he could to enhance his 
career. "When I first came up, there were a lot of guys who were close to 
retiring," said Ripken, ticking off names like Jim Palmer, Al Bumbry and Ken 
Singleton. "Somewhere along the line it seemed there was always some feeling of 
regret ... a lot of small things, nothing in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like I heard a lot of 'ifs" -- if I had done this, or if I had done 
that. I decided then, that when my turn came (to retire) I didn't want to sit 
back and say 'what if.' Of course, I already have one, because they'll always 
wonder what if I had taken a rest now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play games because of the streak," said Ripken. "I play because that's 
what I do. If you start out the season saying you want to play every game, it's 
like going to work every day, and when you play 162 it's great. But when you 
start putting a few seasons together and gets up around 1,000, then things 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken was asked if he could perceive himself playing just to keep The Streak 
alive (something even Gehrig did on occasion). "That's difficult to answer," he 
said with a smile, "but I hope not. It would border on doing something strictly 
for yourself. It wouldn't be something I'd be proud of. It wouldn't go along 
with what I've been saying all these years. It would be a contradiction, and 
something I might question for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
But that shouldn't be interpreted as an indication that a slump would be enough 
to get Ripken out of the lineup. He doesn't believe you solve problems by not 
playing, and he does believe there is enough time for rest in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of one day challenging Gehrig's record is still too far off to even 
comprehend. Ripken would have to play every day until midway through the 1995 
season (when he would be only 34). To put Gehrig's streak, and what Ripken 
already has accomplished, into perspective, consider that Ripken will own the 
third longest streak in baseball history when he plays one more game. To catch 
Gehrig he would have to put together another streak that would be the 
equivalent of the seventh longest in history. 
</P>
<P>
When Ripken's streak started there were three players still active who are now 
in the Hall of Fame -- Carl Yastrzemski, Johnny Bench and Willie Stargell -- 
and current teammate Gregg Olson was in the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
The man comes to play. Every day. And that's all the recognition he expects 
from The Streak. "That's what it means to me -- that I can be counted on to 
play on a daily basis," said Ripken.

WETTELAND IS TAUGHT LESSON, 4-1;

<P>
DODGER ROOKIE, BACK FROM BULLPEN, HIT EARLY BY METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Dodgers' resident wordsmith, starting pitcher John Wetteland, returned from 
a 10-day stay on the bullpen bench Saturday to offer a national television 
audience the following essay: 
</P>
<P>
What I Didn't Do on My Vacation. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't work on his curveball. He didn't work on his pitching mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Dodgers, the Mets worked on Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up three runs in four innings as the Mets scored a 4-1 victory before a 
crowd of 38,453 at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The schooling of a rookie pitcher continues. This kid who read a flowery poem 
aloud at a team meeting this spring has been reduced to simple sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"This stuff I'm throwing," Wetteland said emphatically, "has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
It was Wetteland's second consecutive loss, giving him three defeats in his 
last four starts. During those four appearances he has survived past the fifth 
inning only once. He has given up 11 runs in 20 innings, increasing his 
earned-run average from 2.20 to 3.05. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to start kicking myself in the butt,"' said Wetteland (3-5). "Today, 
I was terrible. I was completely lost." 
</P>
<P>
That was the reason the former reliever was moved back to the bullpen in the 
first place. With several recent days off, the Dodgers were able to juggle 
things so that the best four members of their five-man rotation were given 
extra starts. Wetteland was listed as the No. 5 starter and sent to the 
bullpen, where he was told to help out until they would need a fifth starter 
again. 
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't pitch in relief. For the last 10 days, all of his energy 
went into warmup pitches. He said he didn't have the time to work on anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew I wasn't going to pitch, I could have taken 10-15 minutes every 
couple of days to work on things, to keep my edge," Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
"Throwing to stay sharp is completely different than warming up to come into a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the bullpen, you never know when you are going to pitch, so you can't 
afford to work on things. You can't blow yourself out one day on the side in 
case you get called into a game the next day." 
</P>
<P>
So he did nothing to improve himself between starts, not a good habit in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"On days like today, it is highly evident the difference between this and minor 
leagues," Wetteland said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, he had to throw fastballs because his curveball was 
nowhere near home plate. Kevin McReynolds singled to left. Dave Magadan singled 
to center, moving McReynolds to third. One out later, Kevin Elster's fly ball 
to right field scored McReynolds with the game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
"They were spitting at my curveball (ignoring it) and sitting on my fastball," 
Wetteland said. "It was bad." 
</P>
<P>
It got worse in the fourth inning, when Darryl Strawberry led off with a 
line-drive double to right. After McReynolds walked, Magadan looped another 
double to right to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept trying to find his curve, but it was never there," said catcher Rick 
Dempsey, who doubled in the seventh inning off Met starter Bob Ojeda and scored 
the only Dodger run on Alfredo Griffin's single. "This was a big learning 
process for him today." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what he learned was subject to debate. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher, a starter again after being relegated to the bullpen earlier this 
season, said: "He learned you can't expect too much when you start after being 
in the bullpen. It's a hard adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
But pitching coach Ron Perranoski said that he doesn't agree with Wetteland's 
bullpen theory. 
</P>
<P>
"As a starter, he throws every two days. He probably did that in the bullpen. 
What's the difference?" Perranoski said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said Wetteland caused his own problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make adjustments, as when he saw his curve wasn't working, he 
didn't make adjustments," Lasorda said. "I saw three or four curveballs in a 
row in the same place, in the dirt. You can't keep doing that." 
</P>
<P>
"Next time in the bullpen," Wetteland said, "I'm just going to do my normal 
work and if they need me to pitch the next day, I'll gut it out. But I'm not 
going to let this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
He could be back in the bullpen sooner than he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda, on the other hand, gave up one run on four hits in seven innings to 
improve his record against the Dodgers to 4-0. Since Frank Viola joined the 
Mets from the Minnesota Twins Aug. 1, Met starters have gone 12-2 with a 2.04 
ERA. The two losses have belonged to Viola. 
</P>
<P>
After Randy Myers retired six of the final nine Dodgers to pick up his 21st 
save, the Shea Stadium loudspeaker appropriately blared the song, "Glory Days." 
</P>
<P>
For the Mets, who have won 30 of their last 40 games, those days could be 
coming soon. For Wetteland, they have never seemed farther away. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dempsey, besides hitting a double and scoring the Dodgers' only run 
Saturday, was also walked twice. "Are those pitchers crazy, why wouldn't they 
give me a pitch?" Dempsey said. "Do they think I'm Babe Ruth? Maybe they got my 
average backward. Maybe instead of me hitting .153, they think I'm hitting 
.351." Dempsey improved his average to .164. . . . Reliever Mike Morgan gave up 
one run in two innings. In what is becoming an unhappy bullpen stay, he has 
given up three runs in his last 2 2/3 innings. Earlier this year, he gave up as 
many as three runs in only two of his first 16 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie outfielder Mike Huff made his sixth start after being recalled from 
triple-A Albuquerque Aug. 7. He went 0 for 3, making him four for 19 (.211) in 
those starts. . . . Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director, examined Franklin 
Stubbs' sprained left knee. Stubbs was not placed on the disabled list but will 
be examined next week in Montreal. At that time, Mickey Hatcher will be 
eligible to come off the disabled list. . . . The Dodgers will get their first 
look at new Expo pitcher Mark Langston Monday in Montreal, when he is the 
scheduled starter against Tim Belcher.

NORMAN REACHES FINAL OF INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Norman scored an eagle on the 17th hole and forgot about it. 
</P>
<P>
Norman made his way into the final of the peculiar International golf 
tournament Saturday at Castle Rock, Colo., and immediately started talking 
about today. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's on to the Super Bowl," Norman said. "The playoffs are over, and we're 
going to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The field of 72 has been reduced to 24 players who will compete today for the 
bulk of the $1-million purse, of which $180,000 goes to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
No scores are carried over. All start at zero under the modified Stableford 
scoring system, in which an eagle is worth five points, a birdie scores two, a 
bogey costs one point and a double bogey and higher cost a player three points. 
Pars are worth nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It took six points Saturday to make the final round. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was at six points through 16 holes, then hit a six-iron second shot 
eight feet from the cup and made the putt for an eagle three on the 17th. He 
finished with 11 points, making his final putt just moments before a 
thunderstorm caused a one-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was joined at 11 points by Chip Beck and Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Schulz led all players with 14 points after making seven birdies in a 
bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus made a four-foot bogey putt on the final hole and finished with 
six points. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a very long putt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite also was in danger of leaving early but birdied two of the last three 
holes to finish with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who didn't make the final were Ryder Cup captain Ray Floyd, Lee 
Trevino and Craig Stadler. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger shot his second straight four-under-par 68 to take a two-stroke 
lead over Mike Hill and Dave Hill in the $350,000 GTE Northwest tournament at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger had a 136 total after 36 holes on the 6,501-yard Inglewood Country 
Club course. Mike Hill shot a 66, matching the lowest round of the day, while 
his older brother, Dave, had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Erickson also shot a 66 and was tied at 139 with Frank Beard and 
first-round leader Miller Barber. Beard shot a 70, but Barber slipped to a 74. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Senior of Australia shot a seven-under-par 65 and took a three-stroke 
lead after three rounds of the $500,000 PLM Open at Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Henninger of Eugene, Ore., shot his second consecutive six-under-par 66 
to take a two-stroke lead after three rounds of the Queen Mary Open at Lakewood 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Henninger's 200 total, 16 under par, was one better than the tournament record 
for 54 holes set by John McComish last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sutherland of Sacramento was second at 202 after shooting a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Lehmann of Simi Valley was third at 204 after shooting a 68.

NEWSWIRE: ARGYROS: MARINERS' SALE BEING DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner George Argyros said Saturday that he has had serious discussions about 
selling the Seattle Mariners to a group of Indianapolis businessmen but that 
even if the deal should go through, the team would remain in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group is headed by Jeff Smulyan, owner of Emmis Broadcasting Corp., 
and includes Indianapolis real estate developer Michael Browning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received an offer -- a comprehensive, qualified offer -- from a group 
of investors led by Jeff Smulyan," Argyros said in a news conference at the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"The talks could terminate without an agreement. The Mariners have not been 
sold."

THEIR INSPIRATION; 
</P>
<P>
AUNESE'S FIGHT FOR LIFE DRIVES COLORADO'S PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He's only 21, on the cusp of manhood, but to many Sal Aunese has become a 
teacher, an inspiration, a role model. 
</P>
<P>
Until last March, Aunese was a successful quarterback with one more year left 
at the University of Colorado. He had gained the most total offense -- 1,401 
yards -- of any Colorado player in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
He had set a school record by throwing 92 passes without an interception, led 
the team in earned first downs, passed for 1,004 yards and two touchdowns, and 
rushed for 397 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
With Aunese at quarterback, the Buffaloes were 8-3 in 1988, and were hoping to 
seriously challenge for the Big Eight title and an Orange Bowl berth this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But then he got what he thought was a bad cold, which turned out to be 
inoperable stomach and lung cancer. He has been hospitalized twice in six 
months and the football training season has started without him. 
</P>
<P>
As Coach Bill McCartney leads his team through the season's first drills and 
calisthenics, Aunese endures treatments of chemotherapy and radiation as an 
outpatient at the school's Health Sciences Center in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
He is in seclusion at his apartment, tended to by extended family that commutes 
from Oceanside, where Aunese was a basketball and football star at Vista High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
One sister has taken a leave from her job and moved to Colorado to care for 
him. Friends say his Samoan heritage -- his formal name is Siasau Pepa Aunese 
-- as well as his religious faith and naturally optimistic outlook are 
bolstering his spirits. 
</P>
<P>
But since his disease was diagnosed as cancer, his physical condition has 
deteriorated. Aunese must breathe oxygen from a nose tube around the clock. He 
cannot lift weights or run around the track. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his determination has infused the whole Colorado football program. Aunese's 
doctor, coach, trainer, and teammates say his presence is with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the players have re-dedicated themselves because it is an incentive 
for them to know how difficult life is for Sal, to see how much he suffers," 
McCartney said. "They have more of a resolve and are less prone to complain 
about their own circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
When Aunese showed up for a few minutes at the team's practice last week, it 
was the first time he had been with his teammates since last spring. But he 
became too emotional to talk, said McCartney, so he just told them to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese has declined to discuss his illness with reporters. But its devastating 
impact on his friends and colleagues is revealed through their thoughts and 
words about the young man fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's an hour that goes by that Sal's not in my mind," said 
Dave Burton, the Buffaloes' trainer. "His illness is a poignant and meaningful 
event to all of us. These guys become like part of your family. There was 
already a great deal of unity inherent in the team. Sal's situation has united 
that feeling of family." 
</P>
<P>
Burton said he and his wife have taken their three children, ages 7, 5 and 3, 
to the hospital to visit Aunese, and the kids now write letters and make 
get-well cards for him. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been emotionally depressing," Burton said. "Everybody on the team 
considers Sal their best friend. He was the team leader. He never walked into 
our training room (when) he wasn't singing. He is well loved." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gersoff, the team physician and head of the Sports-Medicine Department at 
the Health Sciences Center hospital, had never been involved in a case such as 
Aunese's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hard for everybody," said Gersoff, who talks to Aunese almost daily. 
"One minute he was sitting on top of the world and the next he was knocked out. 
Seeing him stricken down like this has had an impact on his teammates, who say 
'Hey, this could be me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Describing the cancer as "very rare in people Sal's age," Gersoff said his 
patient is "hanging in there." 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't lost his smiling personality. It would have been so easy for him to 
turn into an angry young man, but he isn't. It's admirable to see someone who 
could so easily give up. But he doesn't. He just keeps on going, looking 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese has told his teammates he wants to be with them Oct. 28 for Colorado's 
game against Oklahoma. The Buffaloes almost beat the Sooners last season, 
losing 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a special person to all of us," wide receiver Jeff Campbell said. "He's 
the epitome of inspiration. If you know Sal, you know that he'll be there."

DAVIS, MASTER OF ALL HE SURVEYS, LEFT HELPLESS BY RECENT DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't get Al Davis wrong; he wants to win, baby, as much as ever. And the 
Raiders really do need to win now, after three consecutive forlorn seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, Davis has other concerns, life-and-death concerns, and the 
man whose entire life has been predicated on controlling his environment is 
having a difficult time coping with the recent deaths of so many people close 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask Davis how he's doing these days, he's likely to say not so good. 
Sure, the Raiders look like a football team in need of help, but turning around 
a football team is something Davis believes he always can do. 
</P>
<P>
"The football I'll get straight," he said. "My biggest thing right now is this 
death business. I've always been able to control the elements of my life, 
dominate my environment without hurting others. But this death business . . . 
That's the thing I can't control and it bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' high school teammate, Don McMahon, died two years ago while pitching 
batting practice at Dodger Stadium. His high school coach, Al Badain, died 
recently and Davis flew a red-eye back to Miami to deliver the eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stanczyk, his athletic director in college at Adelphi, died, as did Don 
Clark, the former USC coach who hired Davis in the late 1950s and gave him his 
start in big-time football. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Davis mourned the death of former Raider John Matuszak, who overdosed 
on prescription pain-killer. And two weeks ago, Raider safety Stacey Toran -- 
who was found to have a massive amount of alcohol in his blood -- drove his car 
to a tragic death. 
</P>
<P>
"When my players and friends start dying, I can't win that battle," Davis said. 
"The team? We'll get this thing straight. When someone's sick, I can go to a 
hospital and actually help the thing and eventually win. But this death, I 
can't beat it. I can't win. It makes you callous. You almost begin to accept 
death a little bit, but you don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 60, looks as weary as his words sound. He is serving on two of the 
National Football League's committees, one searching for a new commissioner and 
the other assisting in the formation of a new international league. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders seem to be on the move again, either to Sacramento or Oakland. 
Already one lawsuit has been filed against him and another is likely to follow. 
The team has playoff aspirations, but only because it is playing in the weakest 
division in the National Football League, the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has enough time to deal with everything he needs to do to get the 
Raiders back on top, Davis said firmly, "No, but I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows better than Davis that, come the second week in September, life 
and death, stadiums and committees don't mean a thing if the Raiders can't 
play. Just win, baby. 
</P>
<P>
"In this culture, nothing can take the place of winning," he said. "You have to 
win, just win." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Raiders haven't been doing much of that lately. Since the end of 
the 1986 season, they have a 12-23 record. They haven't had a winning season 
since 1985. Attendance has fallen off. 
</P>
<P>
Few positions are set. Marcus Allen is holding out and Bo Jackson will be in a 
baseball uniform until the first weekend of October, meaning another bad season 
is not an unreasonable expectation. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis insists that pulling the team back up shouldn't be any different than 
it was after a couple of lean years in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1978 and 1979 (both 9-7, non-playoff seasons) we were down and everyone 
said, 'That's it,' " Davis said. "And we started 1980 by losing to the (San 
Francisco) 49ers, 33-14. But we won the Super Bowl. In 1981 we slipped to 7-9 
and everyone said, 'That's it, here's the decline.' Then we had four great 
years (43-14)." 
</P>
<P>
As veteran tight end Todd Christensen said this week: "Yes, something has to 
happen positively or we'll see an apocalypse of sorts." 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, however, the Raiders probably will have a new home in the next 
year or so. 
</P>
<P>
As the offers roll in, Davis is saying nothing, not about moving, anyway. The 
primary suitors are Sacramento and Oakland, the patient jilted lover waiting to 
be taken back. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, which has plenty of money and space to construct a new stadium, 
initially offered a reported $35 million package. Oakland supposedly has 
offered $32 million, which has some city officials outraged. The Oakland school 
system is in deep financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale, which has already paid Davis $10 million, appears out of the 
running. Indications are that if the Raiders move north, Irwindale will slap 
Davis with another lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the intrigue, Sacramento last week increased its offer to a reported 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the Raiders wind up, Davis, Christensen and anyone else can trace the 
team's football decline to one afternoon, even one play, in a game against the 
Philadelphia Eagles at the Coliseum in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who went into the game 8-4, apparently were headed toward the end 
zone for a winning score in overtime and a playoff berth. Business as usual. 
Commitment to excellence. Just win, baby. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Marcus Allen fumbled, the Eagles returned the ball deep into Raider 
territory and won the game in overtime. The next week, the Raiders lost in 
Seattle, 37-0, and proceeded to lose the next two games for an 8-8 record. They 
didn't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly you can trace it to that," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis, recalling the moment: "We blew it. It started then. That was it." 
</P>
<P>
That might have been the start of the decline, but the Raiders have made some 
unsound decisions since, and Davis has to shoulder some of the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 and 1986 drafts were almost complete washouts. The top three draft 
choices from 1985 have been waived or traded. The top pick from 1986 was waived 
and the second pick never played a down. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with receivers James Lofton and Mervyn Fernandez and newly drafted 
Tim Brown already on the roster, Davis traded this year's No. 1 pick to the 
Bears for Willie Gault, who contributed a career-low 16 catches. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time in several years, the Raiders finally have a relatively 
young, healthy, physically capable quarterback in former Washington Redskin Jay 
Schroeder. He was so intent on being ready for this season, he spent four hours 
a day during a long stretch of the off-season in skull sessions with 
second-year Coach Mike Shanahan, studying the play book. 
</P>
<P>
But in the exhibition opener, Schroeder threw two interceptions, completed only 
four of 12 passes and was booed lustily. He was so upset with himself that he 
walked up to Shanahan during the game and said: "I'm sorry. I put in all that 
work in the off-season and it looked like it wasn't worth anything." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to tell where Shanahan stands, or even how long. There's no 
particular public discord between him and Davis. But if the Raiders don't look 
a lot better by midseason, there aren't many who expect Shanahan to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Raiders' decline may even be a result of Davis' own success at 
picking up other teams' rebels and rejects and turning them into stars in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said: "In the '70s and early '80s, Al's ability to get a person a 
little off-center and deal with him was unique. . . . Other teams began doing 
the same thing that only Al was doing at one time." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what, the Raiders are behind and everybody here knows it, especially 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get this thing straight and we'll be all right," he said.

MIKE DOWNEY: STEINBRENNER A MAN WITH FIRE IN EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
Lucky Bucky Dent became manager of George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees 
Friday. First thing he did was move Don Mattingly from third to second in the 
Yankee batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Every poor slob who becomes manager of George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees 
has his own notion of how he is going to improve the ballclub. Bucky's big idea 
was to move up Mattingly in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Mattingly is too much a gentleman to second-guess a new manager on his 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mattingly has been around long enough that he no longer has 
much stomach for all this Yankee doodling around. He is fed up with seeing guys 
come and go. 
</P>
<P>
So, if the new manager wanted to take a $2.5-million-a-year hitter and make him 
bat behind the leadoff man, fine. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Mattingly ranks among the American League's top five in runs 
batted in. Never mind that Mattingly is arguably the greatest hitter of this 
generation. Lucky Bucky sez: Let's make him the No. 2 man in the lineup, so he 
can try to move the leadoff guy along. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sure enough, Steve Sax led off Friday night's game at Detroit by reaching 
base. Good start for the Bucky Era. 
</P>
<P>
Then, up stepped Mattingly . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . who bunted. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't ordered to bunt. He wasn't dragging for a hit. He just decided to lay 
down the ol' sacrifice for the good of the team. Yep. Uh-huh. In the first 
inning of a scoreless game. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it went foul. 
</P>
<P>
This was just one seemingly insignificant moment in a fairly meaningless 
ballgame, but it spoke volumes. It was Don Mattingly's subtle protest over the 
latest move by the Big Apple's large barge of garbage -- George Steinbrenner's 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"I still consider Dallas to be a good friend," the owner's statement read after 
Dallas Green got pink-slipped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Good friends? Hey, you bet good friends. George Steinbrenner still has seven 
different managers on his payroll, including Green. He is paying six people not 
to manage the New York Yankees. Now, that's what we call a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Green's good bud flew all the way to Detroit to fire his pal, whose team was in 
sixth place. Naturally, this urgent matter couldn't wait a few days, until the 
team got back to New York. Had to happen now. 
</P>
<P>
"Manager Green!" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, mein boss!" 
</P>
<P>
"You haf done poorly!" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, mein boss!" 
</P>
<P>
"I vill still pay you!" 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Herr Steinbrenner!" 
</P>
<P>
"You may leave now! Don't spit in der dugout!" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, mein former owner!" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Green stood up to Steinbrenner, because Green is his own man. He is 
his own man the same way Billy Martin was his own man, and the way Lou Piniella 
was his own man. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that has been the problem. Maybe the Yankees should hire somebody else's 
man. Steinbrenner woke up one morning last week, scratched himself, kicked the 
dog, then decided to fire a few coaches. He told Dallas Green his plan. Green 
looked him in the eye and said, and this is an exact quote: "If you're gonna 
fire anybody, you'd better start with the head honcho." 
</P>
<P>
Picture this scene with Dallas Green wearing chaps and a vest and cowboy boots 
and speaking in John Wayne's voice. It'll help. "Now listen, pilgrim, and 
listen tight. You ain't a-firin' nobody 'round here 'lessin' it's the head 
honcho." 
</P>
<P>
There. That's more like it. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees, Green went on to say 
Friday, was that to manage the Yankees, you need to "succumb to George 
Steinbrenner." 
</P>
<P>
Succumb? Sounds like something a wrestler would do after Steinbrenner jumped 
off the top rope. Succumb. Let's see. How would the classified ad read? 
</P>
<P>
"Wanted: Manager of major league baseball team. Must be dignified, seasoned, 
intelligent baseball career man, willing to succumb to owner. Send letter and 
photograph to: House Ruth Built, Bronx, N.Y., c/o Wacko in Front Office. 
Previous experience managing New York Yankees not necessarily necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee slugger Ken Phelps went so far as to say: "George wanted a puppet." 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, Ken: Steinbrenner is no ventriloquist. This is one act 
where the dummy works the controls. 
</P>
<P>
This has been another stupendous season for George Steinbrenner's New York 
Yankees, who have become a sixth-place team after adding Steve Sax to the 
squad. Imagine where they would be without Sax, who is hitting around .320. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner recently said he would like to have "24 Steve Saxes." Someday, he 
probably will. He'll trade Mattingly and a cow for three magic beans. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 Saxes, meanwhile, will make 27 outs each game by getting singles and 
then getting thrown out trying to stretch them into doubles. 
</P>
<P>
As for Bucky Dent, he should "X" off a calendar every day, like a prisoner. He 
is the manager of George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees, a job with a great 
title, great benefits and no real authority. It's sort of like being Dan 
Quayle.

KEY RETURNS TO PITCH BLUE JAYS PAST ORIOLES, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays have good reason to be optimistic and not just because 
they are only a half-game out of first place in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
The best news for the Blue Jays is that Jimmy Key is back. Key, a liability 
most of this season after being the Blue Jays' most dependable pitcher for four 
years, came off the disabled list to start Saturday night at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Key (8-13) was shaky in his first appearance in more than two weeks, but he 
settled down to pitch the Blue Jays to a 5-1 victory over the stumbling 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander, who was 57-30 in the previous four seasons, gave up hits to 
the first two batters he faced but only two more hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Before being sidelined with an inflamed rotator cuff, Key had lost six games in 
a row and had not won since June 21. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first couple of innings, I felt good," Key said. "But I was falling 
behind hitters, and they jumped on me. Going in, my thinking was not to be too 
fine in the first couple of innings, and they took advantage of it. Later in 
the game, I was able to make much better pitches. I'm encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Manager) Cito (Gaston) after six that I could give him one more 
inning. It made no sense to stay in any longer the first time off the DL, 
especially when we scored those runs in the eighth inning." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milacki (7-11) was the losing pitcher despite retiring the first 12 
batters. It was the third consecutive game in which he went into the fifth 
inning with a no-hitter and lost. 
</P>
<P>
A walk to Fred McGriff and a run-scoring double by Ernie Whitt tied the score 
in the fifth, and Lee Mazzilli's sacrifice fly put Toronto ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who led the division by 7 1/2 games a month ago, lead Toronto and 
Milwaukee by just a half-game. The Blue Jays lead the Brewers by .001. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays also received encouragement from the performance of reliever Tom 
Henke, who pitched two shutout innings in relief of Key. 
</P>
<P>
Henke seems to have turned it around in the last 10 days. In his last six 
appearances, he has pitched 10 scoreless innings, struck out 16 batters and 
earned three saves. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Milwaukee 1 -- Greg Harris had made only one previous appearance in 
Milwaukee's County Stadium, and it was a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
On Easter Sunday in 1987, Harris, then a reliever for Texas, was brought in to 
protect a 4-1 lead. He gave up a three-run homer to Rob Deer, then a two-run 
homer to Dale Sveum to lose the game. 
</P>
<P>
This was a different performance. Harris gave up just one hit in four innings 
and won his first game for the Red Sox when Ellis Burks hit a bases-loaded 
single in the 14th inning. 
</P>
<P>
While ending the Brewers' eight-game winning streak and preventing them from 
taking first place, the Red Sox ended a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible Sunday (in '87)," Harris recalled. "I was just hoping for a 
chance to come in and pitch well." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Minnesota 4 -- After building an early 4-0 lead at Oakland, the 
Twins dropped two balls in the late innings and lost. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson beat out a bunt in the eighth inning. He stole second base and 
tried to steal third. Umpire John Shulock called Henderson out, but third 
baseman Gary Gaetti dropped the ball. Henderson scored the tying run on Jose 
Canseco's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, right fielder Randy Bush dropped Walt Weiss' fly ball for a 
two-base error, and Carney Lansford followed with a game-winning single. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire, Dave Parker and Henderson hit solo home runs for Oakland. 
McGwire's homer, his 22nd, was his first ever against the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, New York 4 -- The switch in managers hasn't put a dent in the Yankee 
problems, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pettis bounced a two-run single off the glove of Yankee second baseman 
Steve Sax with two out in the eighth inning at Detroit as the Tigers won their 
second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have lost both games since Bucky Dent replaced Dallas Green as 
manager Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee reliever Dave Righetti had a 4-3 lead with two out in the eighth when 
the Tigers loaded the bases for Pettis. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Morris (3-10) went the distance to win for the first time since May 12. 
Morris gave up a two-run homer to Jesse Barfield in the second inning, then 
settled down. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Chicago 6 -- The Rangers' ninth-place hitter, Steve Buechele, had two 
doubles and a single, scored two runs and drove in two runs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Buechele, who hit a three-run home run in Friday's victory, helped provide 
Bobby Witt (10-10) with a 7-3 lead, but the Rangers barely withstood the White 
Sox rally. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 13, Seattle 5 -- Jim Eisenreich hit a grand slam and drove in five 
runs, and Bo Jackson hit his 25th home run and drove in four runs in this 
victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, who are 4 1/2 games out of first place, have won five games in a 
row. DAN HAFNER

PHILLIES' MULHOLLAND HAS LAST LAUGH ON GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was merely his sixth major league victory, but Terry Mulholland won't soon 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old left-hander pitched a two-hitter Saturday night at Philadelphia 
to beat his former team, the San Francisco Giants, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland was sent to the Phillies earlier this season as part of a deal in 
which relief ace Steve Bedrosian went to the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Bedrosian who gave up a bases-loaded single to Ricky Jordan with one 
out in the ninth inning that enabled Mulholland to improve to 3-5 with his 
second complete game for the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Roger Craig and the Giants can't feel too bad. Kelly Downs, after 
spending most of the season on the disabled list, turned in his second strong 
performance since coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Downs held the Phillies to three hits in eight innings before giving up a 
double to Len Dykstra and a single to Tom Herr in the ninth. Craig Lefferts 
came in and walked the bases full, then got John Kruk to ground into a 
force-out at home. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian came in to face Jordan. The Giants brought the outfield in, and 
Jordan, on an 0-and-2 pitch, hit the ball over the head of right fielder Candy 
Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland gave up singles to Matt Williams in the second inning and Jose Uribe 
in the sixth. He stopped the 1-2 punch of Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell eight 
times, four apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably is the best game I've pitched and certainly the most gratifying," 
Mulholland said. "I told myself to stay under control and not get carried away. 
I just concentrated on (catcher) Darren Daulton.I wasn't making eye contact 
with the hitters, guys I played with." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland said he owed a lot to Craig. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me an awful lot," Mulholland said, "both in the minors and with the 
Giants." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said Mulholland probably had never pitched a better game. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I'm pleased with Kelly's progress. He was still throwing well, 
into the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Houston 8, Chicago 4 -- Glenn Davis became the first Astro to hit 30 home runs 
in three different seasons in the victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had two other hits and drove in two runs as the Astros tightened both 
division races. The Astros moved within two games of San Francisco in the West. 
The second loss in a row cut the Cubs' lead in the East to 2 1/2 games over New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' Jerome Walton singled in the seventh inning to extend his hitting 
streak to 29 games, the longest by a Cub this century. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings, Mark Portugal 
improved to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Cincinnati 1 -- If the Cardinals had two more pitchers like Joe 
Magrane, they would be a real threat in the East. 
</P>
<P>
It took a five-hitter by Magrane at Cincinnati to give the Cardinals their 
first victory over the Reds after seven losses. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane (16-7) has won five games in a row and 11 of his last 12 decisions. 
With the Cubs losing again, he put the Cardinals within 5 1/2 games of the East 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Magrane is the best left-hander in the league," Red Manager Pete 
Rose said. "He led the league in ERA last year and is again on his way to a big 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Brunansky drove in two runs and made a leaping catch in right field to rob 
the Reds' Todd Benzinger of a home run in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, San Diego 4 -- The Expos are over their slump and climbing back 
into the Eastern race. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Larry Walker, playing for slumping right fielder Hubie Brooks, broke a 
fifth-inning tie with a two-run single, and the Expos went on to win their 
second in a row. They trail the Cubs by three games. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez (13-3) needed last-out help from Tim Burke in winning for the 
first time this month. Burke picked up his 24th save. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- John Smoltz gave up six hits in eight innings at 
Atlanta to end a slump that began after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Boever pitched the ninth to get the save and help Smoltz (12-11) end a 
five-game losing streak. DAN HAFNER

TUDOR MAY PUT RETIREMENT ON HOLD

<P>
Dodger pitcher John Tudor said Saturday that missing most of this year because 
of shoulder problems might alter his plans to retire after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor said he will reevaluate his future this winter when, as a free agent, he 
might seek a one-year contract that would only pay him if he pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to play one more year; this was going to be it," said Tudor, 35, 
who pitched three games this season before being disabled July 8 because of a 
sore left shoulder. "But this year has been a wash. I've been paid this year 
for doing absolutely nothing, and that's not my style. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played 10 years, but it's really only like I played nine years and 
watched one. I don't like it. I'm going to wait until November or December and 
see how it feels. If it feels good, I'll pursue a job for one more year. I 
won't ask for any money, just incentive money that only pays me when I pitch. 
That's only fair." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor wouldn't say whether he preferred to return to the Dodgers. "I still 
don't know whether I would come back, period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Vice President Fred Claire was equally noncommittal. "I can't comment at 
this time, there is still a lot that remains to be seen," Claire said. "The 
season has to run its course." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tudor is not ready to pitch, he said the shoulder feels good enough 
for him to have stopped most of his rehabilitation program. He has been 
throwing in the bullpen every other day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to try to play before the end of the season, sure," Tudor said. "But 
I'm not going to rush it just to see if I can play next year. I'll be able to 
decide that this winter, even if I don't pitch. It will be a touch-and-feel 
thing. And this time, it has to be right." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor still remembers his 10-pitch start in Chicago July 7 that ended a brief 
comeback from arthroscopic shoulder surgery last winter. He remembers arriving 
at Wrigley Field, "knowing that there was going to be big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
He was forced to leave the game before he had retired a batter in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done all we can do," Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director, said of 
Tudor's shoulder. "It is severely arthritic. There's a lot of wear and tear in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But Tudor said that with the variety of ways a body can throw a baseball, 
there's always hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I could come down to making an adjustment in my motion, and I can do that," 
Tudor said. "I've made adjustments in the past. Heck, when I came into the big 
leagues, I was throwing 89-90 m.p.h. consistently. That alone tells you how 
I've been making adjustments."

Jim McMahon figures to be the quarterback of the San Diego Chargers, but it was 
rookie Billy Joe Tolliver who did the Bears in Saturday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon made a surprise token appearance for four plays at the start of the 
second half. Tolliver, meanwhile, threw two touchdown passes to lead the 
Chargers to a 24-7 exhibition victory over the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have much hand in it," McMahon said. "It might have been nicer if I'd 
played the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver connected with Anthony Miller on a 39-yard touchdown pass play and 
threw to Jamie Holland on a 70-yard touchdown pass play in a 21-point third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' other score in the quarter came on a 49-yard pass interception 
return by Elliot Smith. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 35, Denver 17 -- Backup fullback Harry Sydney ran for one 
touchdown and caught a pass from Joe Montana for another as the 49ers 
overpowered the Broncos without John Elway in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Elway was scheduled to start at quarterback for Denver but was held out by 
Coach Dan Reeves because the brace that protects his left knee, which has 
undergone surgery three times, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who completed 13 of 19 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown, led the 
49ers to touchdowns on three consecutive drives to build a 21-3 lead in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 35, Detroit 3 -- Barney Bussey scored on a 70-yard fumble return and 
ran back one of eight Bengal interceptions for another touchdown as the Bengals 
routed the Lions at Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Hilger, Detroit's starting quarterback, completed four of 14 passes for 
89 yards and three interceptions. Eric Hipple completed six of 19 passes for 
102 yards and four interceptions. Chuck Long was four of eight for 43 yards and 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the fans were chanting for rookie quarterback Rodney Peete, 
who did not play. 
</P>
<P>

At least 45 people were killed in a 24-hour period in some of Sri Lanka's worst 
political violence, official sources said in Colombo. The sources blamed an 
extremist Sinhalese group for 35 deaths in Sinhalese-populated southern areas. 
Six people died in clashes in the Tamil-populated north and east, where Indian 
troops are fighting Tamil separatists. Chiefs of the three armed services and 
the police, responding to a threat to kill their families if they do not resign 
and help set up a socialist government, said soldiers and police will do their 
duty.

The Afghan government and rebels marked the 70th anniversary of Afghanistan's 
independence by exchanging rocket and missile fire. About a dozen rebel rockets 
hit Kabul, the capital, wounding at least 10 people. Government forces fired 
rockets and missiles at suspected rebel positions in surrounding mountains. 
Afghanistan declared its independence in 1919 in a treaty ending the third 
Anglo-Afghan war.

A British diplomat and Middle East expert was arrested in London under the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act. He was identified by the British press as Andrew 
Balfour, 39, who had held a series of diplomatic posts in the Middle East. 
Britain's Independent Television News said he was apparently involved in 
facilitating visas for Iranian nationals. Few other details were immediately 
available on Balfour or on a second man arrested along with him. Both were 
later released on bail.

 -- What if they didn't give a concert and everybody came? Not a single rock 
star was scheduled to perform, but cars were lining the roads leading to the 
former Max Yasgur farm where the Woodstock Festival took place 20 years ago. A 
crowd estimated to be at least 20,000 showed up, although some proved 
themselves less hardy than their predecessors by leaving when they were rained 
on. In contrast, a reunion concert 12 miles from Bethel, N.Y., at a resort 
flopped when only 250 people came to see such performers as John Sebastian and 
Edgar Winter. An offer to move the concert to the farm was nixed by Bethel. 
"There's enough frenzy here already," town Supervisor Allan Scott said. Most of 
the Woodstock pilgrims were willing to pay a $5 donation, which is to go toward 
cleaning and reseeding the field when the party's over. Current owners Jeff and 
Charlie Gelish were paying half the cost of providing water and portable 
toilets, and garbage and ambulance services were donated. The crowd was an 
eclectic mix including hippies, bikers, Grateful Dead fans, middle-aged 
tourists and housewives. Local musicians were doing their best to entertain the 
crowd on a makeshift stage, using sound equipment and a generator that were 
donated. Finally, one of the original performers, Melanie, showed up for a 
45-minute encore. "Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?" she said.

 -- An original painting of Mickey Mantle used to create his 1953 baseball card 
fetched $110,000 as the Topps Co. auctioned 35 years' worth of rare cards and 
pictures. Topps spokesman Norman Liss said the winning bid was from Marriott 
Corp., which also paid $80,000 for artwork of Willie Mays from the same year. A 
Jackie Robinson painting brought $71,000 from an unidentified bidder. Paintings 
of Whitey Ford, Bob Feller and Roy Campanella went to the Rarities Group of 
Marlboro, Mass., a collectibles company, for prices ranging from $15,000 to 
$32,000.

 -- The object of the game is to go down the water slide and reach the 
air-conditioned doghouse. On the weekend before jury selection begins in PTL 
founder Jim Bakker's trial on fraud and conspiracy charges, the Charlotte 
Observer in North Carolina published a board game called "Down the Tube." It 
asks true-false questions about the lives of Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye. 
If you land on Tammy's face, you advance four spaces. But if you land on 
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, you must "return to start and sob your heart out."

Fleas carrying bubonic plague have been found on squirrels at two campgrounds 
in the San Jacinto Mountains near Idyllwild, said Riverside County health 
officials. James Lang, public health entomologist for the county health 
department, warned campers and hikers not to feed, touch or even get close to 
squirrels in the area. The two campgrounds where 10 squirrels tested positive 
for the plague-carrying fleas during the last two months were Boulder Basin and 
Stone Creek. Boulder Basin is about six miles north of Idyllwild and Stone 
Creek is four miles north of the mountain town. Symptoms of the disease are a 
reddening of the area around a flea bite, followed by flu-like symptoms. The 
plague can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.

Random negotiations were under way in the telephone walkout against three 
regional "Baby Bell" companies. Bell Atlantic and the Communications Workers of 
America, having reached a tentative pact, conducted talks on local issues, and 
a company spokesman said he was optimistic the Tuesday midnight deadline would 
be met. The strike against Bell Atlantic in the East, NYNEX in the Northeast, 
Ameritech in the Midwest and Pacific Telesis in California and Nevada affects 
about 190,000 employees and 50 million customers. The main issues are wages and 
health care. Ameritech and the CWA are bargaining on a state-by-state basis, 
and a CWA spokesman said talks with Telesis are "making a little progress." 
Formal talks involving NYNEX have been in recess for several days.

DRUG SUSPECT, BAIL ARE LOST

Nothing seemed to work right for Contra Costa County authorities who arrested a 
man on charges of running the most sophisticated drug laboratory ever 
encountered in the county, and then lost him -- and his $150,000 bail -- in a 
series of communications foul-ups and court delays. Barry Starr of Orinda was 
under "house arrest," wearing an electronic monitoring device that would alert 
officials if he left his home between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. The alarm went off on 
a Friday night but because it was the weekend, the monitoring agency in 
Cincinnati waited until Monday to notify authorities. By that time Starr was 
nowhere to be found. Later, officials learned they couldn't even revoke his 
$150,000 bail. Legal maneuverings had caused court delays and the bail bond 
expired before Starr could be brought into court for a hearing on renewing it. 
Contra Costa County Dist. Atty. Gary Yancey said Starr was arrested in 1988 on 
state charges of manufacturing methamphetamines. He subsequently was indicted 
on federal charges and his case was transferred to federal court. Starr is 
being sought by federal marshals.

Michigan-based Enstrom Helicopter Corp. has privately sold training helicopters 
to the Chilean army, but the deal does not violate an embargo on arms sales to 
Chile's military government, officials at the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said. 
Chile's opposition daily La Epoca reported that Enstrom, of Menominee, Mich., 
had sold about 15 three-seat trainers to the Chileans. A U.S. Embassy official 
said the sale did not violate a 1976 U.S. law, which requires that arms sales 
be authorized by the President only after the government of President Augusto 
Pinochet has shown significant progress in respecting human rights.

Two Colorado prison inmates and their wives, captured in a shoot-out after the 
women hijacked a helicopter for a daring escape, will likely face federal air

answering Colorado charges, officials said. Investigators into Friday's escape 
from the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility near Ordway, Colo., said the 
escapees, Freddie Gonzales, 21, and Ralph Brown, 30, and their wives, Patricia 
Gonzales, 41, and Rebecca Brown, 26, surrendered after a nine-minute gun battle 
in Holdrege, Neb., 400 miles from the prison.

JAMES FLANIGAN: RISE IN SAVINGS FOR RETIREMENT NOT A FLUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How swiftly flow the years. Twenty years after Woodstock, the generation of 
young people who attended the 1969 peace and rock festival is thinking about 
saving for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And not only that generation. According to several recent studies, saving for 
retirement has become Topic A among great numbers of Americans -- and hopes are 
high. The majority of those 35 to 44 years old hope to live well in retirement 
on $42,000 in annual income, according to a study by Investors Diversified 
Services, the financial planning firm. Those 45 to 64 years old -- called 
"pre-retireds" in the IDS survey -- reckon to live well on $32,000 a year on 
average. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, hopes are brighter than that. People want to retire early rather than 
wait till age 65, says a survey by Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm. The 
45-and-over folks want to kick back at 62, and the younger, 35-and-up 
generation aims for retirement at 60. 
</P>
<P>
But with the hopes there are fears of not having enough money on which to live 
in retirement. Younger people even worry that Social Security won't be there 
for them, that the government will give them only an IOU when they retire in 
2019 or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Security Safe 
</P>
<P>
So what's the story? Are the fears unfounded, the hopes unrealistic? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that there's no reason to worry about Social Security, but 
whether you can save enough on which to live is cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
First, the anxiety about Social Security arises paradoxically because the 
system has too much money. The Social Security trust fund -- which receives 
deductions from your paycheck -- is taking in more than it has to pay out these 
days because active workers greatly outnumber retirees. So a big reserve, 
currently $169 billion, is building up for the day when today's workers retire. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, that $169 billion is being invested in Treasury securities -- 
meaning, in one sense, that Social Security funds are hiding the size of the 
federal deficit. That's worrisome, perhaps, but the issue is a complex and 
long-term one -- depending on how the government spends the money and whether 
its budget moves toward balance early in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no doubt about "individual cash benefits, which are well financed 
for 75 years out," says Alicia Munnell, research director of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston and author of "The Future of Social Security." The 
reserves will keep growing until the year 2030, when they will amount to $12 
trillion. And after that there is no conceivable way that Social Security could 
get into difficulty until 2046 -- when today's 18-year-old worker will be 75 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings Rising 
</P>
<P>
So benefits are secure. But Social Security only gives a maximum of $11,000 a 
year. How are people who hope for $32,000 to $42,000 a year going to come up 
with the rest of the money? Financial experts -- who suggest 70% of working 
income as a target for retirement -- assume that some funds will come from 
company pensions. But there is a hefty gap to be filled by personal savings. 
</P>
<P>
And that's why "the current rise in the national savings rate is no fluke," 
says Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments who travels the 
country sampling consumer attitudes. "Americans are saving more because of a 
deep desire to do something about their own retirement." 
</P>
<P>
However, saving is hard to do, given the effect of taxes, inflation and the 
need for safe investments when the nest egg is at stake. A return of 3% to 4% 
over the inflation rate is all you can really count on. And to get that you 
need to earn 8% to 9% on your savings -- based on the annual inflation rate 
that the Social Security Administration assumes will prevail in the years 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But taxes can reduce even a 9% return to a measly, after-inflation 1% or so -- 
and that won't build many nest eggs. 
</P>
<P>
What you need is a tax break on savings, and that's hard to come by since 
Congress cut back the Individual Retirement Account in 1986. In the classic 
IRA, you could deduct $2,000 of income and put it away to earn interest that 
was tax-deferred until withdrawal at age 59 1/2 or later. That is, savers could 
put away money earned in high-income years and pay tax on it later, in 
retirement, when it was assumed that they would be in a lower tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
But the new tax laws sharply limited the IRA deduction for employees covered by 
company pension plans. And even though IRA savings could still earn income 
tax-deferred, the non-deductible IRA proved less attractive to the public and 
the national savings rate fell to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why there is a growing demand to bring back the old IRA -- although, 
given today's federal budget troubles, the classic IRA has no chance in 
Washington because it would reduce government tax receipts by $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, proposals to give tax benefits at the IRA's "back end" -- at time of 
withdrawal -- are gaining attention in Washington. Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) 
has a bill proposing an IRA that would allow non-deductible savings to earn 
income tax-free as opposed to just tax-deferred. There would be no tax at 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Federal tax receipts would suffer no immediate reduction, but the IRA holder 
would get the full benefit of compound interest -- which at 9% can double your 
savings in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people with high hopes for retirement think that it's an idea whose 
time has come.

After pumping $2.7 billion into the United States over the past several years, 
Shigeru Kobayashi owns a large chunk of downtown Los Angeles and a string of 
landmark American office buildings. He hobnobs with presidents, dabbles in 
philanthropy and celebrates his achievements in a high-profile publicity 
campaign. But he has an image problem at home. 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi, 62, founder and president of the real estate giant Shuwa Corp., is a 
perennial outsider here, regarded with a degree of disdain in Japan's staid 
business world because of his unorthodox style. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a furniture maker, Kobayashi emerged from the unsavory demimonde of 
Tokyo real estate speculation to become one of the world's richest men. He is a 
self-made man and a dynamic entrepreneur, but he concedes: "My image is 
decidedly bad." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the maverick landlord has acquired a dubious reputation as a corporate 
raider, a breed of investor that the Japanese derisively call nottori-ya, 
literally a hijacker. Last month, Kobayashi revealed himself as the leading 
shareholder in two medium-sized supermarket chains and rattled Establishment 
nerves with bold talk of merging them -- against the wishes of their family 
managements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Reform 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi says he challenged the sacrosanct rules of corporate ownership 
because he intends to help rationalize Japan's arcane distribution system, 
which, he points out, has posed a "structural barrier" to foreign imports and 
so is a flash point in trade friction. 
</P>
<P>
In justifying his stock market gambit, Kobayashi paints himself as an agent of 
internationalization who aims to repay a debt of gratitude to his American 
friends by promoting structural reform in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how hard America tries, there are a lot of old commercial practices 
among the causes of the trade imbalance," Kobayashi said the other day during a 
rambling, two-hour interview at his Tokyo headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same in the securities industry, the construction industry and the 
distribution industry," he said. "There are many things Americans cannot 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Such rhetoric comes as the governments of Japan and the United States are 
poised to begin consultations next month on a wide range of so-called 
structural impediments to free trade. After Texas oilman and corporate raider 
T. Boone Pickens Jr. clashed earlier this year with the management of an auto 
parts maker affiliated with Toyota Motor Co., the cross-holding of corporate 
equity promises to become a contentious issue. Pickens was denied a seat on the 
board of Koito Manufacturing Co., despite his status as its largest 
shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kobayashi is adopting the tone of a Japan-basher these days, his 
motives remain even more opaque than the confidential balance sheets of his 
tightly held real estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi has been the conspicuous symbol of Japan's massive investment in the 
United States since 1986, when, enriched by the dramatic appreciation of the 
yen, he bought the Arco Plaza complex in Los Angeles for $620 million and paid 
a staggering $165 million for a single office tower, the ABC building in 
Manhattan. Amid rising anxiety about the sudden influx of Japanese capital, 
Kobayashi went on a phenomenal shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, his Los Angeles-based subsidiary, Shuwa Investments Corp., 
trumpeted its debut as a major American landlord with a full-page ad in leading 
U.S. newspapers that teased: "If you followed the Shuwa Group's 1986 
acquisitions, stay tuned for future developments." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, more acquisitions followed; Shuwa now owns 35 major U.S. office 
buildings. A blitz of publicity also followed. Kobayashi donated $1 million to 
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and attended a farewell banquet when the 
former President left the White House. He wrote $100,000 checks to the cities 
of Los Angeles and New York and made a substantial contribution to the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. In January, he attended President Bush's 
inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambience of Ostentation 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this year, he grabbed headlines by awarding building contracts in 
Tokyo to two separate joint ventures involving American firms, which U.S. 
officials hailed as an important step to loosen Japan's closed construction 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes the limelight, but he has a relatively low reputation in Japan," 
observed Tokunosuke Hasegawa, executive director of the Research Institute of 
Construction and Economy, a Tokyo think tank. "There is the perception that 
he's buying social status in the United States and trying to bring it back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
A visitor to Shuwa's head office in the fashionable Akasaka section of Tokyo is 
struck by an ambience of ostentation. A large porcelain Dalmatian guards the 
entrance to the executive suit, while more dog statues and a row of colorful 
paintings in gilt frames line the long hallway. Kobayashi's office is 
cavernous, with a white marble floor and a wall covered with a patchwork of 
commendations, mounted keys to several cities and clocks set to times in 
California, Chicago, New York, London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi stopped the interview at one point to illustrate his commitment to 
U.S.-Japan good will by conducting a guided tour of a row of blown-up 
photographs, prominently displayed on easels, depicting himself in a tuxedo 
next to U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and John H. Sununu, the 
White House chief of staff. The three were among those honored with a "golden 
plate" award by the American Academy of Achievement in June. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which Americans he admires most, he named Pickens, the corporate raider, 
who he has never met but regards as a "very important person." Likewise, he 
feels an affinity for New York real estate czar Donald J. Trump, who embodies a 
"fighting spirit" that he lamentably finds missing in many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disdains U.S. Work Habits 
</P>
<P>
In Kobayashi, there is a paradox of emotions about America, a blend of humility 
and arrogance sometimes seen in Japanese men of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled being strafed by U.S. warplanes when he was a private in the 
Imperial Japanese Army operating a locomotive near the end of World War II. He 
said he was awed by the wonders of American Cadillacs and Lucky Strike 
cigarettes during the impoverished Occupation Era. He also expressed contempt 
for the American work habits that he has encountered since taking his real 
estate business across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to an American company after noon on a Friday, and there's hardly anybody 
around -- they go to lunch and don't come back," Kobayashi said. "You can't win 
when you do that sort of thing. The Americans of old have disappeared. They've 
stopped working and lost their fighting spirit." 
</P>
<P>
After discharge from the army at age 18, Kobayashi suffered briefly from 
tuberculosis, dropped out of Meiji University, went to work with his father 
building furniture, then struck out on his own with a shipping business. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Japan was a supply and repair center supporting U.S. combat troops 
in the Korean War, and Kobayashi made a killing. Once the war ended, the 
company went bankrupt. But Kobayashi discovered that the value of its land had 
ballooned, and he plunged into real estate during Tokyo's postwar redevelopment 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
His Shuwa Corp. introduced the concept of "social buildings," or integrated 
rental space for bars, restaurants and galleries, in Tokyo's Ginza district. 
Starting in 1965, he pioneered the market for Western-style condominiums, 
catering to what Hasegawa of the construction think tank called the "Japanese 
Western complex." His timing was impeccable: The new middle class was ready to 
start moving off traditional tatami mat floors and onto the carpets, chairs and 
beds of his "Shuwa residences." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Move to America 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, when the housing market sagged, Kobayashi branched into Tokyo 
commercial real estate. Today, after a dizzying price spiral that saw Tokyo 
land prices double and triple during the mid-1980s, Shuwa's 54 office buildings 
in Japan are valued at about $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kobayashi dispatched his only son, Takaji, to the United States in 
1978 to head a subsidiary that for many years floundered, losing millions of 
dollars developing apartment complexes in California. But when the yen nearly 
doubled in value against the dollar after 1985, Kobayashi made a bold move into 
U.S. commercial real estate, using his hyper-inflated Japanese holdings as 
collateral to leverage financing from an array of banks. 
</P>
<P>
"He literally took half his fortune and staked it all on No. 7 red," said Alan 
Woodhull, a real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. "He's one of the 
entrepreneurs who grew up in the postwar period when tremendous opportunities 
were available to people with bold spirits. The guy has a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi attributes his success to his freedom from the constraints that bog 
down decision making at most Japanese corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always done things that no one else is doing," Kobayashi said. "I don't 
imitate people, I do it myself. You also have to work 10 to 20 times harder 
than anyone else. But as an outsider, you can do things very freely. It's 
outsiders who bring about revolution." 
</P>
<P>
In management style, Kobayashi has a reputation as an autocrat, who calls all 
the shots on U.S. operations in frequent transpacific telephone calls with 
Takaji, 35. Stories circulate in Los Angeles alleging that the elder Kobayashi 
has been arrogant and vindictive in his dealings with business associates and 
former employees, in some cases blackballing those who fell from his favor. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent interview with The Times, Kobayashi did display signs of a short 
temper. When documents were not immediately available, he snapped at his aides 
-- five of whom were on hand to pipe in with names, dates and details. 
Kobayashi frequently rolled his head and squinted at the ceiling through his 
large, horn-rimmed glasses, as though exasperated with some of those in his 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alarm Unwarranted 
</P>
<P>
But as the interview proceeded through the lunch hour, Kobayashi gradually 
displayed warmth and courtesy, and spoke with animation about his business 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The recent backlash against Japanese investment in the United States, known in 
Japan as "investment friction," is of particular concern to him. Japanese 
invested $16.54 billion in U.S. real estate last year, for a cumulative total 
of $42.9 billion, according to a recent study by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a 
Los Angeles accounting firm that specializes in real estate. Kobayashi protests 
that alarm is totally unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust America that much, that I'd invest my capital and leave it there. It's 
a permanent investment," he said, denying that Shuwa repatriates rents or 
profits. "Rather than creating investment friction, this should be seen as a 
plus in the trade imbalance." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shuwa's activities are fostering the redevelopment of American cities 
and creating jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the emotional level, there seems to be a lot of problems, but economics is 
not emotional," he said. "In reality, we can't bring home the buildings we've 
constructed in America. We leave the benefits behind in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi rejected criticism that Shuwa paid too much for some of its U.S. 
acquisitions and drove up prices in otherwise stable markets. Prices may well 
have been too low to begin with simply because of a lack of demand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of buildings (on the market) in Los Angeles, and nobody was 
buying them. But when I bought Arco Plaza, that sparked demand in the 
transactions," Kobayashi said. "They say it was a problem because I was a 
Japanese. But what if it was a Frenchman or an American or an Englishman? I 
don't think they would have said much. The buyer just happened to be from 
Japan, so it stood out."

AYALA, BADER RAISE MORE THAN $250,000 EACH FOR SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite new restrictions on political contributions, Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino) 
and Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) already have collected more than a 
quarter of a million dollars each for their face-off in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will say how much they hope to raise for next year's state Senate 
election. But Bader said that some recent Senate candidates have spent up to $2 
million. And Ayala, exuding confidence about his reelection chances, said Bader 
"may need $2 million," because he is not as well-known in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Their aggressive fund raising has produced 30% of the more than $1.1 million 
that has been collected by campaign committees for the San Gabriel Valley's 15 
state legislators in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contribution Limits 
</P>
<P>
Ayala raised $185,481 and Bader raised $156,727 since Jan. 1. Adding that money 
to funds already on hand, each man had nearly $270,000 in cash at the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The solicitation of political funds appears to have been unhampered by the new 
contribution limits that took effect in January. Individuals and corporations 
are permitted to give up to $1,000 a year to a candidate, and broad-based 
political action committees can give no more than $5,000 a year. These 
limitations are part of Proposition 73, passed by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala said the restrictions "don't bother me in the least." As long as rules 
apply equally to Democrats and Republicans, he said, he won't complain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Confusing' 
</P>
<P>
But Ayala said the whole fund-raising business has become "very confusing" 
because voters last year approved two campaign-financing initiatives and the 
rules are still being interpreted by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission and the courts. Although he might know the rules one day, he didn't 
know "what the rules will be next week," Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala and Bader stepped up fund raising in the first half of this year because 
Proposition 73 established contribution limits according to the fiscal year, 
from July 1 to June 30. Thus, each campaign could ask a donor for $1,000 before 
June 30 and still collect another $1,000 during the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
A court decision earlier this month gave both campaigns another incentive to 
rush their fund-raising efforts. That ruling could prevent candidates from 
collecting any money from October through the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal upheld a provision of Proposition 68 that bans fund 
raising in non-election years but delayed implementation until October. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission put most of Proposition 68 on hold last 
year because of conflicts with Proposition 73. Although both measures were 
approved in June, 1988, Proposition 73 received more votes, giving its 
provisions priority. But the Court of Appeal ruled that the fund-raising ban in 
off-years can take effect because it is not in conflict with any of the 
provisions in Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Abuses 
</P>
<P>
Bader said Proposition 73's contributions limits and its rule prohibiting one 
politician from transferring campaign funds to other candidates have ended 
political abuses that were damaging the state. No longer will state legislative 
leaders be able to raise millions of dollars from special interests and then 
dole out the money to candidates, he said. Instead, candidates will have to 
raise money themselves from a large number of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bader said, ways will be found to circumvent the contribution 
limits. For example, it would be easy enough for donations to be split among 
family members so that instead of the head of the household giving $5,000, as 
was possible under the former regulations, five family members can give $1,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"A family can run contributions in from the cousins and the uncles, but you're 
still not going to get the big hunks of money" that used to be common, Bader 
said. "I like the changes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reform Drawback 
</P>
<P>
The drawback to the campaign reforms, particularly the ban on fund raising in 
non-election years, Bader said, is that challenging an incumbent has been made 
more difficult for anyone who does not hold another political office. 
Incumbents can always raise money, he said, but challengers need every dollar 
they can get, and any limitation on their fund raising can be devastating to 
their chances. 
</P>
<P>
Bader, a former mayor of Pomona, is giving up a safe Republican seat in the 
Assembly to challenge Ayala, a former Chino mayor and San Bernardino County 
supervisor who has been in the Senate since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate district, which stretches from Pomona eastward through Chino and 
Ontario to San Bernardino, has been undergoing rapid growth, with housing 
tracts supplanting farms and ranches. Republican registration has climbed from 
31% in 1982 to about 40% today, according to Bader's figures, and 39%, 
according to Ayala's. 
</P>
<P>
Since Republicans tend to vote in greater numbers than Democrats, Bader 
describes the district's political makeup as "competitive -- leaning 
Republican." Ayala scoffs at such talk, insisting that he is still in good 
shape with 50% of the voters registered as Democrats. "When I was in school, 50 
was more than 39," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said his race against Ayala is likely to be the most hotly contested 
Senate election in the state next year. "It's going to be a classic 
Republican-Democratic battle," he said. "It'll be a real shoot-out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lopsided Registration 
</P>
<P>
All of the other legislative districts in the San Gabriel Valley have lopsided 
registration advantages for one of the two major parties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the advantage, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) could be in 
political trouble because of a federal indictment stemming from an FBI 
investigation of political corruption in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was indicted by a federal grand jury in May on charges of racketeering, 
money laundering and extortion. He was accused of asking for a $3,000 payment 
in 1988 from FBI agents who had posed as businessmen seeking special 
legislative help for a business project. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who raised $250,000 last year, has raised only $14,850 in the first 
half of this year. Although Montoya has declared his intention to seek 
reelection, a spokesman at his district office in El Monte said no one was 
available to discuss fund raising for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aide Indicted 
</P>
<P>
The senator has been using his campaign funds to pay attorney fees for himself 
and his former top aide, Amiel Jaramillo, who also is under indictment. 
Montoya's campaign spending reports listed $75,000 in payments to his attorney, 
Michael Sands, since October and $10,000 to Jaramillo's attorney, Christopher 
Wing. 
</P>
<P>
Two other San Gabriel Valley legislators, Assemblymen Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) 
and Frank Hill (R-Whittier), have been identified as targets of the federal 
investigation, but neither has been charged. And both have continued to raise 
money successfully. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Nolan raised $170,858 -- more than Bader and nearly as much as Ayala 
-- in the first half of this year. The difference was that Nolan spent 
$115,208, much of it to pay fund-raising expenses, leaving him with much less 
than Bader or Ayala at the end of the reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, EXPENDITURES 
</P>
<P>
Figures show contributions and expenditures during the first six months of 1989 
for all campaign committees of state senators and Assembly members representing 
the San Gabriel Valley, and the amount of money the committees have in the bank 
as of June 30. The figures are based on reports filed by campaign committees 
with state and county offices.

Savings and Loan Salvage Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 201 to 175, the House sent to President Bush legislation (HR 1278) 
designed to bail the thrift industry and the federal government out of the 
financial calamity caused by thecollapse of hundreds of savings and loans in 
the 1980s. The Senate had passed the bill on a non-recorded vote. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the S &amp; L salvage will be for the government to borrow 
$50 billion primarily for closing or merging troubled thrifts and meeting 
federal reimbursement obligations to those who lost billions in U.S.-insured 
deposits. About $20 billion will be incurred by Treasury borrowing and included 
in the fiscal 1989 budget. The remaining $30 billion will be borrowed by a new 
government-chartered corporation but will not be counted on the budget nor 
tallied as part of the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thrift industry will have to repay the $50-billion principal, 
taxpayers will be required to pay borrowing costs. Conservative estimates are 
that the total bailout will cost at least $160 billion, including debt service 
over 30 years with the average taxpayer supplying $1,000 of the amount. Other 
estimates double those projected costs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Chalmers Wylie (R-Ohio) said: "We are not bailing out S &amp; Ls. We 
are not bailing out their stockholders or their managers. We are delivering on 
our promise that the federal government stands behind the safety and the life 
savings of millions of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) said the rescue "should have been paid for by 
taxes, current taxes, a very small tax, but the President could not bring 
himself to say the word. So we have foisted on our children and grandchildren 
an unconscionable debt of perhaps $100 to $200 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Violence, TV and Antitrust 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 399 to 18, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1391) providing 
an antitrust exemption to enable competing television industry executives to 
meet to discuss ways of making their programs less violent. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the bill would "remove the perception, 
apparently held by many in the television industry, that the antitrust laws are 
a possible impediment" to less violent programming. Opponent Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose) said: "I have never seen an exemption to the antitrust laws that worked 
for the benefit of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the antitrust exemption.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
To Pass S&amp;L Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 201 to 175, the House sent to President Bush legislation (HR 1278) 
designed to bail the thrift industry and the federal government out of the 
financial calamity caused by thecollapse of hundreds of savings and loans in 
the 1980s. The Senate had passed the bill on a non-record vote. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the S&amp;L salvage will be for the government to borrow $50 
billion primarily for closing or merging troubled thrifts and meeting federal 
reimbursement obligations to those who lost billions in U.S.-insured deposits. 
About $20 billion will be incurred by Treasury borrowing and included in the 
fiscal 1989 budget. The remaining $30 billion will be borrowed by a new 
government-chartered corporation but will not be counted on the budget nor 
tallied as part of the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thrift industry will have to repay the $50 billion principal, 
taxpayers will be required to pay borrowing costs. Conservative estimates are 
that the total bailout will cost at least $160 billion, including debt service 
over 30 years with the average taxpayer supplying $1,000 of the amount. Other 
estimates double those projected costs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Chalmers Wylie (R-Ohio) said: "We are not bailing out S&amp;Ls. We 
are not bailing out their stockholders or their managers. We are delivering on 
our promise that the federal government stands behind the safety and the life 
savings of millions of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) said the rescue "should have been paid for by 
taxes, current taxes, a very small tax, but the President could not bring 
himself to say the word. So we have foisted on our children and grandchildren 
an unconscionable debt of perhaps $100 to $200 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Violence, TV and Antitrust 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 399 to 18, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1391) providing 
an antitrust exemption to enable competing television industry executives to 
meet to discuss ways of making their programs less violent. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the bill would "remove the perception, 
apparently held by many in the television industry, that the antitrust laws are 
a possible impediment" to less violent programming. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Don Edwards D-San Jose) said: "I have never seen an exemption to the 
antitrust laws that worked for the benefit of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the antitrust exemption.

Argentina by Train -- In Karl Zimmerman's story that appeared in last week's 
Travel Section ("Chugging Along on the Old Patagonian Express") the address and 
telephone number for Trains Unlimited Tours was incorrect. The company has 
relocated and can be reached by writing to 235 W. Pueblo St., Reno, Nev. 89509. 
The new toll-free telephone number is (800) 359-4870.

ZAN THOMPSON: A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN LOS FELIZ SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young woman took a solo and when she opened her mouth, the music sounded as 
if a nightingale were singing. Her voice had that same liquid tremolo that a 
songbird has. The illusion was so strong that the memories came floating back 
and, of course, I thought of "A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square," "It's 
Been a Long, Long Time," and a hundred other songs of the green and hurtful 
days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
So do phrases of music and wafts of perfume transport you instantly and 
entirely into another time and place. The girl finished her solo and joined 
again in the voices of the Armenian chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Marine Der-Ghazarian, and she had just won a scholarship in piano 
to the USC School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus was singing on a waning afternoon two weeks ago in the Los Feliz 
area garden of Dr. Aram and Marilyn Kezirian. Its conductor is Setrak 
Der-Ghazarian, the father of the beautiful girl with the lovely voice. 
</P>
<P>
The second song the chorus did was a patriotic song called "Mother Armenia." 
Change the languages and it could have been Mother Ireland. So do all saddened 
people sing of their homelands, in part defiance and courage and part tears for 
lives lost in a forlorn cause. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for the choral concert was the annual meeting of the USC Friends 
of Armenian Music. I was lucky enough to be a guest because Aram and Marilyn 
Kezirian are friends of mine, as are Jessie and Roy Kaprielian and Eric 
Avazian, all supporters of the Friends. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is 10 years old, and for the past eight years there has been a 
course in Armenian music at the university, a one-unit course with one lecture 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Avazian, who was president of the group five years ago, says that there 
are about 150 members. That shows what a few determined people with a cause 
they believe in can do. 
</P>
<P>
The official definition of the group is "an organization devoted to the 
well-being of Armenian music studies at USC through its membership, 
contributions, its public activities and its sponsored events. 
</P>
<P>
"The Friends provide the financial support and public awareness the program 
requires to accomplish its educational and cultural goals. 
</P>
<P>
"To preserve the rich Armenian musical heritage for future generations is its 
main objective. The Armenian musical library at Doheny Library at USC, 
cataloguing and collecting manuscripts, compositions, and through Armenian 
music and through scholarships to support music students of Armenian heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Avazian is a lawyer as is his twin brother Arthur. Eric told me that early 
supporters of the organization included Grant Beglarian, the dean of the USC 
School of Music when the Friends was founded. Another was Zohrab Kaprielian, 
who was dean of the School of Engineering and later a vice president of USC. 
Eric Avazian told me they had very few and much appreciated large donations, 
but mostly the group's money comes from very small donations. The new Friends 
president is Rose Ketchoyan, a leader in the Armenian cultural community. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the meeting was conducted in Armenian. I can tell you it was just like 
most annual meetings you have attended. People were congratulated, sworn in and 
escorted out with thanks. Meetings have been conducted in this format since 
someone first gathered the neighbors to see what they could do about the 
marauding saber-toothed tiger that was knocking down property values. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting and the chorus performance, there was a buffet of Armenian 
dishes the women had prepared. There was tabouleh, that marvelous salad of 
bulgur, parsley, mint leaves, green onions and tomatoes, dressed in olive oil 
and lemon juice. The boureg was made of phyllo dough, filled with a subtle 
white cheese and parsley. There was lamajun, a dough-wrapped turnover stuffed 
with meat, herbs and tomatoes, and a dozen other dishes. The star of the 
dessert table was the baklava, pastry dough layered with honey and walnut. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, I made tabouleh at home, and while it wasn't as good as that of 
the Friends, it was tasty. 
</P>
<P>
If you're ever invited, be sure and ask for Aunt Pauline Kezirian's yalanchi. 
She is Dr. Aram's sister and yalanchi is grape leaves stuffed with rice, 
onions, parsley, pine nuts and lemon juice. It's almost as good as the smoked 
salmon pate I learned to make at that fine restaurant on the Hook of Howth on 
the north sweep of Dublin Bay.

So, you've sweated through the preliminary auditions, agonized through the 
finals, endured the probation period and collapsed with happiness upon getting 
the nod: You're a tenured member of the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Now what? What's at the end of the rainbow? 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will be playing classical subscription concerts, pops programs, 
family concerts and a summer series. It also will be playing for choral 
concerts and for such visiting dance companies as the Kirov, San Francisco and 
Joffrey ballets and the American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
If you play every one of these programs -- and, as needs vary, not every 
musician is asked to play every program -- your take home pay will be about 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Which won't make much of a down payment on a condo in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But probably you will have other options. Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's 
executive director, says that all the Pacific's concert dates and rehearsals 
for them take up about 24 weeks out of the year, "roughly 50%" of one's time. 
Which leaves "plenty of opportunity for doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even though the musicians have a contract with the orchestra, the 
Pacific Symphony is essentially made up of free-lancers, according to Robert W. 
Stava, secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Musicians Assn., the union that 
represents them. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Pacific can't keep them busy -- and can't keep food on their tables 
-- on a full-time basis, "all are full-time musicians" who also teach, play in 
other orchestras or, if they're lucky, tap into the lucrative Hollywood studio 
market, Stava said. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, it's hardly the most stable and secure life imaginable. But, as Spisto 
notes, this is the professional musician's lot in life. If anything, he said, 
Pacific Symphony members have it a little better than most. "There are more 
than 1,600 orchestras in the country," he said. "Only about the top 50 can 
offer the type of contract we are." 
</P>
<P>
The average Pacific Symphony member receives only about 50% of his income from 
the orchestra. "The key," Spisto repeated, "is that they've got to be flexible. 
They've got to be willing to do a variety of things and, if they are, they will 
do very well. Many of our musicians make far more than the average major 
orchestra player throughout the country. In fact, some musicians came to 
Southern California to seek the diversity and income that goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
A number of the musicians, he said, end up making more than the $67,000 he gets 
as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"Some earn a great deal of money," he said. "Some basically are making a modest 
living. But my sense is that they all are doing reasonably well." CHRIS PASLES

RANDY LEWIS: WOODSTOCK PROMOTERS SHOOT THE MOON AND WIN; 
</P>
<P>
BUT 1969'S OTHER GREAT SHOW, MAN'S FIRST LUNAR LANDING, IS LAGGING A BIT ON THE 
NOSTALGIA CIRCUIT 
</P>

<P>
Is it just coincidence that more attention has been devoted this summer to the 
20th anniversary of Woodstock -- that back-yard-barbecue and rock 'n' roll 
party for 400,000 -- than to the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the 
moon? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, and any number of explanations loom. 
</P>
<P>
One is that there were so many eyewitnesses on Max Yasgur's farm back in August 
of 1969 that there's no dismissing Woodstock as a hoax, foisted on the world 
out of a Hollywood movie set. (The only proof brought back by those guys who 
said they went to the moon was a couple of buckets of rocks.) 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that Woodstock struck a deeper emotional chord with an 
entire generation (especially if you count everyone who saw the movie) than the 
sight of a couple of guys on TV hopping around the lunar surface. Jeez, we'd 
seen that years before on "Lost in Space." 
</P>
<P>
You might even consider that Woodstock is getting so much better play on TV, in 
newspapers and magazines because there's a wider variety of vintage photos 
available than for the landing on the moon. What with a half-dozen moon shots 
in all, one mission looks pretty much like the next, right? 
</P>
<P>
The real reason, I'd submit, is far more tangible. Woodstock has been doing 
stronger box-office on the nostalgia circuit because nobody gave enough thought 
to making a buck off Apollo 11. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. Have you seen Neil Armstrong posters and T-shirts flooding 
finer department stores everywhere? Record companies issuing the flight tapes 
on triple compact-disc sets (with new liner notes by Carl Sagan)? Movie 
companies re-releasing the historic film footage to theaters and pay-per-view 
cable networks nationwide (in Lucasfilm THX stereo)? Bumper stickers with a 
photo of the moon, the NASA logo and the slogan "We did it OUR way"? 
</P>
<P>
If they had any real smarts, the feds could be selling off most of those stones 
Neil and the boys brought back from Tranquility Base as 20-year-old 
commemoratives. They could net enough to finance a manned shot to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it -- NASA blew it. They had a hot property -- one of the monumental 
scientific explorations in history, certainly the biggest to be preserved so 
exhaustively on film, magnetic tape and computer memory -- and what did they do 
with the bulk of it? Handed it over to public television. 
</P>
<P>
Not the folks connected with Woodstock. To them, the sky's the limit. Heck, the 
hordes of individuals and corporations holding any ties whatsoever to those 
"three days of peace, love and music" not only made headlines for all the ways 
they dreamed up to cash in 20 years later, but generated even more news with 
fights over all the alleged copyright infringements. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., which had copyrighted the name of "Woodstock," sued a bunch of 
'60s rockers -- including some of those who turned the festival into a 
marketable commodity in the first place -- to stop them from using the name in 
connection with a commemorative concert they wanted to stage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, lacking rights to the Woodstock name hasn't prevented capitalizing 
-- with a capital CAPITAL -- on the Woodstock memory. This weekend, the "20 
Years After Music &amp; Art Festival" at Cal State Dominguez Hills is bringing 
together such Woodstock hall-of-famers as Canned Heat (minus Bob (Bear) Hite 
and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson -- deceased), Electric Flag (minus Mike Bloomfield 
-- deceased), Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company (minus Janis Joplin -- 
deceased) and the Band of Gypsies (minus Jimi Hendrix -- deceased). 
</P>
<P>
Curious that the 20 Years After fest didn't or couldn't book 10 Years After. Is 
it because leader Alvin Lee is still alive, or because by now they'd be 30 
Years After and it'd just be too darn confusing? 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the whole enterprise is being sponsored by KLSX-FM, the Los Angeles 
radio station that owes its existence to dredging up hourly the Ghosts of Rock 
'n' Roll Past. Besides the retro music, there will be an "art and crafts bazaar 
featuring tie-dye shirts, hand-tooled leather and beaded goods, candles, 
pottery, musical instruments, body painting and much more activity reminiscent 
of the '60s." All the quaint accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a "psychedelic car and hippie van competition." Beginning to feel 
like Charlie Brown at Christmas, when he comes upon Snoopy decorating his dog 
house to "win, win win -- money, money, money"? 
</P>
<P>
If the real Woodstock had been born of this attitude, it wouldn't have featured 
Hendrix, Joplin, the Who and others at the forefront of popular music. It would 
have been an ode to the great music, cars and clothes of 1949. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad Jackie Gleason isn't still around to put this all in the proper 
perspective. Wouldn't you just love to see Ralph Kramden getting more and more 
fed up with all the genuflecting over the anniversary of Woodstock, turning 
from his dinner plate and growling: 
</P>
<P>
 One a these days, Alice -- to da moon!

RURAL FUROR IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
ANGER GREETS PLANS FOR HUGE CHURCH IN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A plan to build a massive church complex east of Mission Viejo with more 
seating than the Crystal Cathedral and enough parking space to cover seven 
football fields has ignited the wrath of residents and environmentalists 
battling development in the hills and canyons of southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Saddleback Valley Community Church, which is affiliated with the Southern 
Baptist Church, is planning to spend $55 million to build a permanent home on a 
113-acre parcel bordering Cleveland National Forest. Its proposal calls for a 
4,800-seat, seven-story sanctuary; two lighted softball fields, 84 rooms for 
Sunday school classes and offices, a day-care center and parking for 2,200 
vehicles in lots that would include two multilevel structures. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?" asked Sherry Meddick, a Silverado Canyon resident who has 
championed numerous efforts to preserve the county's diminishing backcountry. 
"They want to build parking structures in a rural area. Most of us out here 
don't even have garages. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Meddick's anger at the ambitious proposal is echoed by scores of other 
residents and environmentalists who believe the size and scope of the project 
is inconsistent with the bucolic character of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even county planners have expressed concern that the project would be too 
urbanized for the area. The planners last week recommended approval of a much 
smaller church center -- one with a 2,800-seat fellowship hall, no sanctuary or 
softball fields, and fewer than half the number of Sunday school rooms and 
offices church officials want to build. Further, planners recommended limiting 
on-site parking to 1,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
"As proposed, this church is not appropriate for a rural setting," said Lynn 
Dosherry, chief planner for the advance planning unit of the county 
Environmental Management Agency. "What concerns us most is how much of the 
natural terrain would be altered. They are talking about completely reshaping 
the look of the land. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Meddick would agree. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an anti-church movement," she said. "The issue is appropriateness. 
That area has been designated by the county as a rural transition zone. And, 
believe me, there is nothing rural about a 4,800-seat church." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the church -- which, with its more than 1,500 members, is one of 
the county's fastest growing congregations -- contend that their proposal has 
wrongly become a lightning rod for opposition in the larger controversy over 
development in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Church elders contend that 80% the proposed church site, off Santiago Canyon 
Road north of Cook's Corner, would remain undeveloped, being dotted with stands 
of historic oak trees and framed by pristine ridgelines. Moreover, except for 
the day-care center and the softball fields, officials said, most of the 
complex would not be in use other than during Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Bought in 1987 
</P>
<P>
"If you listen to some people, it sounds like thousands and thousands of cars 
will be going in and out our church every day," said Glen Kruen, executive 
pastor of Saddleback Valley Community Church. "That's just not true. . . . A 
church on that site is far more compatible with the environment than houses" 
would be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The church bought the land from the William Lyon Co. for $3.5 million in late 
1987, culminating a four-year search of southern Orange County for a place 
suitable for a permanent facility. Since it began in 1980, Kruen said, the 
church has led a nomadic existence, having leased 13 different facilities. 
Sunday 
</P>
<P>
services are now held on the campus of Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Many believed the wanderings ended with the purchase of the Lyon parcel. Lyon, 
which is one of the nation's largest home builders, already had tentative 
approval to build 78 homes on the property. As part of the deal, the church 
acquired the tract maps to build the homes should its sanctuary proposal be 
rejected. (It is more likely, however, that the church would instead sell the 
property and its 
</P>
<P>
development rights.) 
</P>
<P>
The church complex is one of five specific project proposals county officials 
are considering together with a broader plan to set development guidelines for 
the 6,500-acre region known as the Foothill-Trabuco area. The county Planning 
Commission is expected to consider the Foothill-Trabuco Specific Plan as well 
as the five individual proposals next month, then turn its recommendations over 
to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, in turn, will have public hearings and vote on the 
Specific Plan. Environmentalists and developers agree that whatever the county 
decides may set the course for growth in the county's rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Among Congregation 
</P>
<P>
Support for the project among the members of Saddleback Valley Community Church 
is intense. Earlier this month, more than 200 of them packed a county Planning 
Commission meeting on the subject. The support is, in part, rooted in the 
desire for a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
"Several thousand people who belong to that congregation need a place to 
worship," said Brett Bray, a regular at the Sunday services at Trabuco Hills 
High, who also lives in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there is going to be more traffic in the area. But change is coming, 
whether it is from this church or some other project. And I'd rather have a 
church in my back yard than a shopping center or more housing tracts." 
</P>
<P>
Detractors are showing equal determination. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing low-density or low-intensity about this project," said 
Trabuco Canyon resident and activist Diana Glass at a recent Planning 
Commission hearing. "This is a big-time development that will alter forever the 
look and feel of this whole area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Warnings 
</P>
<P>
Some residents warn that the project would dramatically increase the traffic on 
two-lane Santiago Canyon Road, which is already reaching capacity because of 
residential development in nearby Portola Hills. 
</P>
<P>
To build the church, environmentalists contend, tons of earth will be moved and 
several oak-tree-covered knolls will be bulldozed to manufacture 80-foot-high 
slopes along Santiago Canyon Road to conceal the sanctuary and other church 
buildings from the view of passing motorists. Opponents also argue that 
building 78 homes on one-acre lots at the site would change the environment 
less than the church complex would. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting homes out there would be much more reasonable," said Meddick, who is 
president of the Rural Canyon Residents Assn. "A church can keep growing and 
growing, adding an unlimited number of new members. But with a finite number of 
homes, you know what you're getting." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Malkoff, a land planning consultant representing the church, said opponents 
have unfairly portrayed the project as a "concrete giant." 
</P>
<P>
Malkoff said that, in an attempt to be "good neighbors" and show their 
recognition of the concerns about traffic, overdevelopment and building 
heights, the church scaled down its proposals from what they were a year ago. 
The proposal for the sanctuary reduced the number of seats from 5,700 to 4,800 
seats. The heights and configurations of several buildings have been changed to 
better conceal them from Santiago Canyon Road, Malkoff said. The church also, 
in an attempt to discourage its members from using forest land, eliminated 
several hiking and biking trails leading to Cleveland National Forest on the 
north side of the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bare Bones' 
</P>
<P>
"We've scaled back the project to the bare bones," Malkoff said. "I'm not sure 
we can reduce it further and still have a credible church program or provide 
for this congregation to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Malkoff said that the Santiago Canyon Road site was not the congregation's 
first choice. He pointed out that, in a county whose population has nearly 
doubled since 1970 and whose median home price is $250,000, the congregation 
had a tough time finding land it could afford. The Lyon property, although it 
is farther away from the residential core of Saddleback Valley, is big enough 
for the church to operate its many varied programs in one place. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at every piece of available land from Irvine to San Clemente and 
found nothing that was large enough within our price range," Kruen said. "It's 
only because of our size that we were able to finally afford" the Lyon site. "I 
don't know how a small church can do it these days. We're lucky." 
</P>
<P>
But Kruen said that he is not sure how much longer the church can afford to 
wait to build its facility. Interest payments on the mortgage for the property, 
he said, are running about $28,000 a month, and the annual property taxes are 
about $100,000. "That's half a million dollars a year, and there's nothing we 
can do but sit and wait," he said. "It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are 'Impatient' 
</P>
<P>
Don Hill, a Mission Viejo resident and three-year member of the church, agreed: 
</P>
<P>
"The congregation is excited about becoming part of that community out there, 
helping shape its future. But some members are getting impatient. They believe 
the time to move forward is now -- or find another alternative." 
</P>
<P>
And there are canyon residents who are not opposed to having a church there. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bess, president of the Canyon View Condominium Assn., the body that 
oversees operation of the 141-unit complex, lives on a ridge west of Santiago 
Canyon Road in the Portola Hills development. Looking east from his back yard, 
he would be peering right down on the church. Bess said he has concerns about 
the potential for traffic but that he believes there would be some advantage to 
having the church there. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for churches in this community," Bess said. "This is a fair 
proposal that will help our community mature. We can't say no to everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What the Church Is Proposing 
</P>
<P>
The Saddleback Valley Community Church is proposing to build a 4,800-seat 
sanctuary and other buildings on a 113-acre parcel in the foothills east of 
Mission Viejo. The project has drawn 
</P>
<P>
opposition from environmenttalists and local residents, who argue that it would 
change the character of the area. Church officials disagree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also proposed for this site 
</P>
<P>
* A 2,886-seat fellowship hall that would include assembly seating, classrooms, 
administrative offices, dining hall, kitchen and storage areas. It would be 54 
feet high and about 74, 750 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* Three ancillary church buildings would include 84 Sunday school rooms, 
offices and multipurpose rooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* A 4,985-square-foot day-care center and playground for 200 children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* Parking, including two multistory parking structures, for 2,200 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* Two lighted softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* A resource conservation area and artificial lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sanctuary 
</P>
<P>
The 4,800-seat sanctuary would be nearly seven stories tall at highest point 
and cover 51, 337 square feet. 
</P>

CHURCH'S SUCCESS BUILT ON BLEND OF YUPPIES, MARKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When pastor Rick Warren asked his burgeoning Saddleback Valley congregation for 
money to build a permanent church, Don and Hootie Hill were willing to do what 
they could. 
</P>
<P>
The couple sold their four-bedroom, three-fireplace lakeside home in Lake 
Forest, moved to a smaller home in Mission Viejo and contributed the profit to 
the church building fund. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the congregation, which numbers 4,000 on Sundays, gave recreational 
vehicles, stocks and cash generated from retirement accounts, second mortgages 
or vacation funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have a strong desire to build a house for the Lord," Hootie Hill said. 
Warren "had the vision and he had us catch it. . . . He's a motivator, no doubt 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when an estimated 95% of Orange County's young congregations are 
stymied by prohibitive land and building costs, Warren's Saddleback Valley 
Community Church, a 9-year-old congregation of many previously unchurched baby 
boomers, has been able to purchase a $3.5-million, 113-acre site in the 
semirural Foothill-Trabuco area. Even more unusual, the Southern Baptist church 
has proposed a controversial $55-million compound that would include the 
county's largest sanctuary with 4,800 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Hill believes it was "a total miracle of God." Others credit Warren's charisma, 
shrewd timing and marketing techniques -- like sermons based on surveys and 
"Jacuzzis for Jesus" baptisms -- with the church's success. Saddleback 
Community Church is among the fastest growing congregations in the country, 
according to a recent study done at Southwest Baptist College in Bolivar, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently we've got a message that is meeting a real need in people's lives," 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
The church has spawned 13 "daughter" congregations in Southern California and 
Warren holds seminars on church growth for pastors of various denominations. 
One this year drew 500 pastors from as far away as Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole philosophy that basically says we're trying to take a traditional 
message and communicate it in a contemporary way," Warren said. "Our big 
emphasis is on people: What do you need? Where are you hurting?" 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Baptist preacher and a high school librarian, Warren, 35, grew up 
in Redwood Valley, a rural town north of San Francisco, and graduated from 
California Baptist College in Riverside and Southwestern Baptist Theological 
Seminary in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
After seminary in 1979, Warren said he made a demographic study of areas likely 
to need new churches and discovered Saddleback Valley was the fastest growing 
area at the time in the fastest growing county. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife moved in 1980 with "no members, no friends, no building, no 
income," he said. "We pulled into a real estate office and met a guy named Don 
Dale. I said, 'Hi, my name's Rick Warren, I'm here to start a church. We have 
no money.' Within two hours, he showed us a condo, got us the first month 
rent-free and became our first member." 
</P>
<P>
Warren designed his church based on his own door-to-door survey of 500 
residents. He discovered his target was "Saddleback Sam," a prototypical yuppie 
who believes in God but has not attended church since childhood. The "Sams" 
told him they weren't going to church because sermons were boring, people were 
aloof, child care was a problem and -- curiously in light of his later success 
-- pastors were too interested in money. 
</P>
<P>
Warren believes the days are gone when people go to church out of habit. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of baby boomers would attend church if it used their kind of music, the 
pastor talked in real-life terms of people's problems of paying bills, stress 
and freeways and what the Bible says about raising kids." 
</P>
<P>
(What does the Bible say about freeways? "Be patient," Warren said.) 
</P>
<P>
The church, for example, has no creed or statement of faith and does not use 
the word Baptist. To attract the unchurched, Warren has: 
</P>
<P>
* Placed full-page ads in the local Saddleback Valley News with grabber 
messages for Saddleback Sam: "Some Days Nothing Seems to go Right!" "Most of Us 
Live Our Lives the Way We Watch TV." "Is Your Marriage Hurting?" "Are You 
Making More Money But Enjoying Life Less?" 
</P>
<P>
* Sent brochures with photos and comments from converts to 35,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Based on a survey of the radio listening habits of his congregation, formed a 
band with electronic keyboard and synthesizers for Sunday worship and scheduled 
top Christian singers like Debbie Boone for Easter services. 
</P>
<P>
* Developed dozens of activities for individuals and families such as bowling, 
fishing, a luau for singles and 26 small Bible study groups. The church also 
sponsors 15 softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
From 146 members in 1980, the church has grown to 1,500 official members with 
voting rights on land purchases and budgets. Four thousand generally attend 
Sunday services at Trabuco Hills High School and 13,000 names of visitors are 
in a computer. The church has 12 ministers and a support staff of 35. 
</P>
<P>
Like most young Orange County churches, the Saddleback Community congregation 
was a wandering tribe, holding Sunday services for five years at Laguna Hills 
High School before moving to Trabuco Hills, and using other church or school 
district facilities for its programs. 
</P>
<P>
Without a permanent building, Warren uses the ocean, lakes, swimming pools and 
"What we call Jacuzzis for Jesus" -- a member's back yard hot tub in Nellie 
Gail Ranch -- for baptisms. 
</P>
<P>
Though arranging meetings in far-flung facilities is frustrating and costly -- 
last year, the church paid $200,000 in rent to Saddleback Valley School 
District -- Warren put off his building program "as long as possible" to let 
the congregation grow, said executive pastor Glen Kruen. "If 200 people are 
giving, or 4,000 people are giving, it's a big difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the initial $1.5 million raised in the fall of 1987, an equal amount 
in pledges is coming in at $500,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Warren won county approval to build a 5,700-seat church on 72 
acres in Rancho Santa Margarita, said church planning consultant Mel Malkoff. 
The plans fell through when a Newport Beach developer bought the property while 
the church sought financing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time they were able to tie up enough land to build the 
church program at an affordable price," Malkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
To potential neighbors who cry that a seven-story, 4,800 seat church would ruin 
the countryside or that churches should not be allowed to build recreation 
fields, church leaders say the compound they propose provides multiple 
community services -- such as day care and recreation -- and should be treated 
as if it was a school or community center. 
</P>
<P>
Churches, particularly those in Orange County, are developing in a manner 
similar to malls, which replaced neighborhood shopping centers, Malkoff said. 
Saddleback Community Church typifies the trend of a larger church offering 
specialized services such as counseling and recreation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're trying to do -- be a community service institution and 
provide a lot of amenities builders don't want to provide, such as day care," 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
"A verse in the Bible says Jesus moves in four ways: physically, spiritually, 
intellectually and socially. We believe the purpose of the church is to be able 
to help people be better in all areas." 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 10 letter to County Planning Commissioner Steve Nordeck, Warren 
wrote: "It is not the duty of county staff to define what a church should or 
shouldn't have as part of its ministry. Our attorneys have informed us that 
this is a clear violation of the separation of church and state issues." 
</P>
<P>
The church's popularity dictated its size, he wrote. "If the residents didn't 
want the church, they wouldn't attend and the size could be scaled down! 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell 12,000 residents to stop liking their church and to go form a 
smaller one!" 
</P>
<P>
Warren concluded: "We believe this is God's piece for a beautiful community 
amenity that will benefit the people who already live there. After meeting 
nearly ten years without our own permanent home, we are committed to this 
piece."

KRISHNAS' LAGUNA BEACH FESTIVAL FALLS IN STEP WITH 'FREEDOM' WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a sparkling Saturday afternoon in Laguna Beach: a cloudless blue sky, 
waves crashing onto a beach packed with bronzed bodies, a volleyball game in 
progress, and bumper-to-bumper traffic on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Then, from a crowded sidewalk up the street, comes the increasingly loud sound 
of jingling, jangling, chanting and drumbeats. Heads turn. Eyebrows lift. 
</P>
<P>
A pack of bobbing, smiling Hare Krishna devotees comes into view, clad in 
pastel-colored robes of peach and white and green, dodging parking meters and 
handing out brochures to anybody who would take one. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like something we do with the preschool children -- freedom of 
expression of oneself within a group," said Susan Ludeman, who said she runs a 
preschool in Las Vegas and was watching the procession. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth annual Krishna festival at Main Beach Park, a time for 
spreading the good word about vegetarian diets, reincarnation and meditation. 
But it was also a time for politics, a time when the Krishnas are trying to 
cultivate public good-will while they appeal an Orange County court case that 
could force them to sell seven temples, including one in Laguna Beach. (Except 
for one temple in Los Angeles, the other six temples are scattered around the 
country.) 
</P>
<P>
As part of this public relations campaign, a group of about 30 Krishnas are 
participating in a 1,000-mile "walk for religious freedom" from San Francisco 
to Tijuana, said Tracey Killeen, 25, who joined the movement three years ago in 
Boston. "We're not out here recruiting members." 
</P>
<P>
The walk began May 29 and is expected to end in Tijuana during the Labor Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Krishnas believe their First Amendment rights have been threatened because 
of a lawsuit that accused the group of kidnaping and brainwashing a 15-year-old 
Cypress girl who left home in 1974 to join the Laguna Beach temple. After Robin 
George returned home in 1977, she and her mother sued the Krishnas and won a 
$32.5-million judgment. The judgment has since been reduced to $9.7 million, 
and the Krishnas may have to sell seven of their temples to pay if the decision 
is upheld by the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Krishnas are appealing the ruling, Killeen said, "because under the First 
Amendment, we have every right to make this decision to practice Krishna 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to explain the Krishna faith, which devotees believe has been 
maligned in the news media, the Laguna Beach temple set up informational 
displays under maroon-and-gold striped tents just south of the lifeguard 
station at Main Beach Park. Visitors perused information on reincarnation, 
vegetarian diets and the history of the Krishna movement, while a four-man band 
on a makeshift stage chanted happily to the beat of cymbals and drums. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Varnadeaux of Claremont stopped to read a display about the dangers of 
eating meat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very happy I had fish for lunch," Varnadeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
The Krishnas also had religious items for sale, including incense, meditation 
beads, copies of the Krishnas' sacred text, the Bhagavad-Gita, and T-shirts. 
Another booth offered free samples of Krishna cooking, including rice, bean and 
vegetable dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Come and take a plate, special for you!" the Krishna behind the table urged. 
"No meat, no colors, pure nature." 
</P>
<P>
Lola Busch of Mission Viejo munched cauliflower fried in sunflower oil while 
she scanned information about vegetarian diets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a 'born-again' Christian," Busch said. "I don't understand it, but it's 
interesting. The food's good." 
</P>
<P>
The festival was part of the California experience for some tourists, who 
captured chanting Krishna members on videotape and in snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from North Dakota," explained one woman as she photographed the Krishna 
procession from across the street. "It's something new to me." 
</P>
<P>
But not to Susan Ludeman of Washington, who said, "This is just normal -- what 
you'd expect to see out here."

ROAD PROJECT TO TIE UP TRAFFIC NEAR AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On an average day, more than 27,000 vehicles use Campus Drive near John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But starting Monday, airport officials predicted, traffic there will be 
anything but average. Officials foresee major rush-hour tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
That's the day that extensive road widening work will begin, adding two lanes 
to the four-lane thoroughfare between MacArthur Boulevard and Bristol Street. 
The new lanes will cover a strip of what is now Airport Way South and the 
median between Airport Way and Campus Drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Route Recommended 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the northbound entrance to the airport from Campus Drive will be 
closed, as drivers will not be able to turn left there from Campus. However, 
drivers traveling south will still be able to turn right at that entrance. 
</P>
<P>
For two to four months, then, officials said, the only other entrance to the 
airport will be from MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Officials recommend that drivers use Birch Street as an alternative route. 
</P>
<P>
Because Campus Drive serves many airport-area businesses, airport officials 
earlier this year met with local business owners to discuss the project's 
effect on them and ways to notify the public that their businesses would remain 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation firms on Airport Way South alongside Campus Drive will remain open; 
access will be available on driveways through the construction area, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The southbound exit from the existing passenger terminal to Campus Drive will 
also remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the $3.5-million project actually began with the relocation of utility 
lines in May. The project is expected to be completed in March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The project also includes widening the Campus Drive bridge over the Corona del 
Mar Freeway. Work to widen Campus Drive at the MacArthur Boulevard intersection 
is scheduled to begin in mid to late 1990, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The road-widening is part of the airport expansion program, the total cost of 
which is estimated at $310 million. That figure includes $50 million for a new 
passenger terminal and for new roadways, taxiways, aircraft aprons and parking 
garages.

HUNTINGTON BEACH READY TO PICK NEW POLICE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach is expected to have a new police chief Monday night when the 
City Council decides among three finalists vying for the top law enforcement 
job in Orange County's third largest city. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, all of them police chiefs in smaller cities, are Richard M. 
Tefank of Pomona, William E. Eastman of Pleasanton and Ronald E. Lowenberg of 
Cypress. Each would get a raise by winning the Huntington Beach job, which pays 
about $85,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the second- or third-highest chief salary in the county," said Huntington 
Beach City Administrator Paul Cook, for whom the police chief works. "I still 
have a little more work to do but I plan to make my recommendation before the 
council meeting and hopefully they will decide that night." 
</P>
<P>
The new chief will succeed Grover (Bill) Payne, who retired Aug. 4 as the 
department's most veteran officer. Payne, 54, who began his law enforcement 
career in Huntington Beach in 1958, became chief in 1987, intending to retire 
within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Donald Jenkins, who was not a candidate for the job, has been acting 
chief for the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said his final pick will be "a team player, which is very important to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of chiefs don't get involved (in the city's management team) and 
basically run the police department as though it is a fiefdom of their own," he 
said. "We want someone who interacts with the rank and file and is visible in 
the community, and works well with other city leaders. I want the new chief to 
attend briefings and get to know the (officers) on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bill Martin, president of the Huntington Beach Police Officers Assn., 
whose political action committee endorsed several City Council candidates, 
said: "We're looking for a strong chief who's going to be good for morale of 
the rank and file." 
</P>
<P>
The new chief will be the first in decades who did not rise through the 
Huntington Beach police ranks. He will inherit a department of 213 sworn 
officers who police a city of 187,000 residents plus thousands of visitors who 
flock to the city's eight-mile shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Payne took the reins of the department when it was being sued for alleged 
brutality in its use of stun guns on jailed men. The excessive-force 
allegations and the lawsuits, which were settled before trial when the city 
paid five defendants $60,000 each, represent the most controversial episode of 
Payne's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Eastman and Lowenberg were both candidates for the 
Huntington Beach job. Cook said all three finalists have strong leadership and 
management skills. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman, 48, has been Pleasanton's police chief since July, 1981. He was a 
captain with the West Covina police force before that. His 66 sworn officers 
patrol a city of 52,000, according to Pleasanton Lt. Dave Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Eastman, president of the California Police Chiefs Assn., wrote an 
"open letter" to baseball player Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics and sent 
it to the ballclub management. He chided Canseco for citations for driving with 
a loaded gun in his car and for five speeding tickets, including one in 
Pleasanton, a 45-minute drive from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Your sniveling was quite profound when you bemoaned the fact that your 
teammate, who was following you, was not ticketed," Eastman wrote toward the 
end of the two-page letter. "That's really class!" 
</P>
<P>
Pleasanton Lt. Dave Freeman said Eastman, who could not be reached for comment, 
is well-liked among the department's rank-and-file. "Our officers association 
-- he's always gotten along well with them," Freeman added. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg, 43, has been Cypress police chief since December, 1981. He started 
his law enforcement career as a patrol officer in Cypress in July, 1967, and 
rose to sergeant in July, 1972. Lowenberg left Cypress in March, 1977, to 
become a lieutenant for the Baldwin Park Police Department. He left two years 
later and became a police captain in Tustin, where he remained until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He leads a department of 52 sworn officers that patrol a city of 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cook praised Lowenberg's handling of the arrest and conviction of his son, 
Robert E. Lowenberg, 21. The younger Lowenberg was sentenced to two years in 
prison for starting two forest fires two summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
The fires destroyed 7,100 acres of Cleveland National Forest and caused $2.7 
million in damage. The younger Lowenberg went through voluntary drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation. His father was supportive and open about the family 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very well-liked here," said Nancy Leonard, the city personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Tefank, 44, has been with the Pomona Police Department for 16 1/2 years, the 
past three as chief. Before that he spent four years with the Montclair Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
His San Gabriel Valley force has 171 sworn officers that police a community of 
120,000, the largest department and community of the three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing Tefank "would be great for them, bad for us," said Jack Blair, acting 
Pomona police captain. "Obviously, we're partial."

SPIRIT OF ADOPTION REACHES INTO AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was that smile. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago this month, Cheryl Shotts of Indianapolis watched as Diane 
Sawyer interviewed a starving boy for a "60 Minutes" segment on the famine in 
the west African nation of Mali. 
</P>
<P>
Mesmerized by the boy's gentle grin and dignity in the face of the death around 
him, Shotts felt she must do something to save the child. Her life would soon 
become a voice for African children looking to escape a life of hunger, disease 
and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Shotts, a delegate at the North American Council on Adoptable Children, which 
wraps up its four-day annual convention at the Anaheim Marriott hotel today, is 
viewed as an example of the organization's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,600 people came to Anaheim to swap ideas about adoptions in the 
United States and how Americans can adopt children from other countries. Shotts 
held a seminar on adopting African children Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kroll, NACAC's executive director, said the purpose of the conference is to 
provide workshops on various aspects of adoptions, including how to deal with 
children who have special needs and how parents can best provide for the new 
members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
"We really do go out of our way to give children a future," executive director 
Joe Kroll said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
For Shotts, the adoption process meant four months of red tape and $12,000 in 
expenses before Mohammed, the boy she had seen on "60 Minutes," arrived to a 
new life in Indianapolis with her husband, Charlie, who flew to Mali to get the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Shotts said Saturday that after seeing Mohammed on television she 
knew that she would find him "even if I had to tear up the world looking for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, estimated to be 13 at the time -- no official records were available 
-- at first thought he came overseas to be a housecleaner. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, you're my son,' " Shotts said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for the family to realize that emotionally, Mohammed was a 
cross between a 20-year-old and a 5-year-old, she said. On one hand, he knew 
about MTV from a group of U.S. Army soldiers he had met in Mali. On the other, 
he did not know how to tie a shoelace or pull up a zipper. 
</P>
<P>
Now 17, he likes wearing his Batman hat around the house -- and watching his TV 
favorite -- CNN's nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know how to be a child," Shotts said of her son, who had been left 
alone since he was 5. "He never had a childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Shotts, who later located and adopted Mohammed's brother, said her "African 
angel" enjoys learning in school and has adapted well. Now a U.S. citizen, 
Mohammed dreams of becoming the U.S. ambassador to Libya or Iran, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shotts, who formed Americans for African Adoptions Inc. after Mohammed arrived, 
leaves for Ethiopia in October planning to return with 13 children from that 
impoverished nation engulfed in civil war. The children will be adopted by 
families in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have tremendous potential," she said. "Once they're given the right 
environment, they excel."

EXTENDED LENGTH OF KRAFT MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One measure of the greatness of our country has been our unique legal system. 
</P>
<P>
My opinion is that our judicial system has lost track of its goal and seems to 
be running for its own sake, not the sake of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin would express 
his dismay over the length and cost of Randy Steven Kraft's trial. After all, 
this man was found driving with a corpse whose presence he couldn't explain in 
the passenger seat of his car. McCartin said the trial should have been over in 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
It is no mystery to me why these trials take so long. The longer the trial, the 
more attorneys are paid. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there is a simple solution already created by the attorneys. 
However, it was conceived by the attorneys to limit costs in medicine, not law. 
It's called Medicare. Attorneys decided that for life-and-death surgery, 
physicians and hospitals could only charge a maximum allowable charge. There 
are criminal penalties for charging above this level. Bureaucrats review each 
charge, and they decide whether the procedure was necessary and reasonable, and 
they will disallow any excess. Some states require that physicians accept 
Medicare patients to maintain their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The entire groundwork has already been laid to reduce court costs. If maximum 
charges can be set for surgery, hospital, and anesthesia charges -- situations 
in which there is no "appeal" for mistakes because of forced economy -- then 
why not for court trials? 
</P>
<P>
Court-appointed defense attorneys would be paid fixed reasonable fees and 
nothing more. Let them hire extra attorneys out of this amount. Let them take 
two years. Let them delay, to a point. Fines could be levied for undue 
postponements. Then after the trial, a utilization review board -- a panel 
composed of non-attorney bureaucrats -- would evaluate and reduce the fees as 
they see fit. Of course, the acceptance of these fees would be a condition to 
practice law. 
</P>
<P>
In the Kraft case, the panel might, for instance, decide that extending the 
trial beyond what was necessary to convict on the original murder charges was 
unnecessary and would not be paid for -- just like unnecessary laboratory work, 
hospitalization or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is no chance that the attorney Legislature would enact such 
measures as they did against physicians. I have no desire to abridge our Fifth 
("due process") and Sixth Amendments wherein the accused "shall enjoy the right 
to a speedy and public trial . . . and to have the assistance of counsel for 
his defense." But what about the right of the people to a speedy trial? Due 
process has been converted to "dough process" by the attorneys. Our Founding 
Fathers could never have foreseen the ridiculous delays and concepts in the 
McMartin, Ramirez and Kraft trials. 
</P>
<P>
We voters should initiate a proposition to set court fees. It's our only hope. 
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

ACCEPTANCE OF HOMOSEXUALS AS 'MINORITIES' IS COMMON -- BUT WRONG 
</P>

<P>
The proliferation of "gay pride" days across the country -- replete with 
parades, festivals and smiling public officials -- confirms the increasing 
power and political sophistication of a movement that had, until quite 
recently, "dared not speak its name." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Orange County, homosexual political activism is on an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
After the Board of Supervisors voted down an unnecessary AIDS discrimination 
ordinance, which would have afforded special status to a behavior-based group, 
homosexuals, militant board members of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center of Orange County, which receives your tax dollars to encourage and 
support homosexuality, participated in a "die in" to accuse the supervisors of 
being responsible for deaths of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
The incriminating evidence is that the Board of Supervisors would not grant 
legitimacy to sodomy. Many of these same individuals have disrupted local town 
hall meetings, instigated what KCBS reported as a "near riot" at Santa Ana City 
Council meetings and participated in boisterous pickets, usually shouting down 
an opposing view. 
</P>
<P>
What has caused such a transformation in public acceptance? Traditional 
liberals, like Thomas Jefferson, regarded homosexual acts as a form of 
"buggery," not unlike bestiality (but worse than bestiality because he thought 
it was more "injurious" to society); modern-day liberals arrange mayoral 
proclamations, set aside public parks and politically bless acts historically 
regarded as a self-destructive perversion. Why? 
</P>
<P>
The secret lies in an event "gay pride" days celebrate: the Stonewall Riot in 
Greenwich Village in June, 1969. When homosexuals resisted a police raid on the 
Stonewall Bar with rocks and epithets, it sparked more than a short-lived riot 
in the Village. The demonstration became a movement. The "movement" came from a 
powerful political locomotive: the language of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
By positioning themselves as a minority, homosexuals skillfully used the 
rhetoric of civil rights ("discrimination") and the widespread public 
legitimacy of the civil rights movement to advance their political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
As a reverend who endeavored to advance the civil rights movement in 
conservative areas of North Dakota and Delaware in different Presbyterian 
churches that I served, I have found it increasingly curious that many people 
uncritically, indeed reflexively, accept this comparison of homosexuals to 
minorities. To equate a status fixed by genetics (sex, race) or historical 
accident (national origin) with a behavior-based status (a group linked by a 
common preference, say, to commit sodomy) requires serious analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of homosexual behavior on contemporary culture is increasingly 
clear. This byproduct of the sexual revolution has spawned enormous public 
health problems. The median male homosexual, the Centers of Disease Control 
discovered in the early days of AIDS, has had more than 500 sex partners. A 
small slice of the population (perhaps as small as 1.4%, based on recent 
statistical profiles from major cities and surveys by the National Institute of 
Mental Health) is responsible for the majority of syphilis cases in the 
country. Anal sodomy has been the principal means of transmission of the most 
enormous pandemic this country has ever seen, and one which the Wall Street 
Journal estimates will cost $60 billion next year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexual practices are so unwholesome that they generate staggeringly 
disproportionate cases of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, venereal disease, parasite 
infections and other exotic ailments to such an alarming degree that one doctor 
in the New York Times Magazine has called the average homosexual "a tropical 
island of exotic diseases." 
</P>
<P>
The only answer is the mesmerizing impact of a misplaced analogy. The person 
who finds sexual expression in sodomy (or, for that matter, in incest, 
adultery, bestiality or sadomasochism) can define himself as a member of a 
particular "minority" who shares that behavior. But it makes no sense for him 
to claim the same social protections of those who are born black, female or in 
a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
A popular celebration of one of the most dangerous behaviors in modern life is 
hardly a constitutional imperative or sound public policy. Nor is it 
compassionate to those who (despite the growing number of the groups like 
Homosexuals Anonymous and the treatment success of both traditional 
psychiatrists and religious groups) continue to do damage to themselves or 
others by leading unnatural and destructive life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the Old and New Testaments, Plato in his "Laws," the great 
majority of major religious tradition of the world and Thomas Jefferson had it 
right -- and modern political trends have it wrong?

FINDING LOST PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Humanitarians of Orange County is extremely concerned about a recent 
development in our county regarding lost pets. The cities of Westminster and 
Costa Mesa are no longer contracting with the county's animal shelter in 
Orange, effective July 1, 1989. Because cats and dogs often cross the borders 
between cities, this also affects the many cities bordering on Westminster and 
Costa Mesa. This change means that owners of lost pets now need to look at two 
or three different facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in or near Westminster and are missing or have found a pet, please 
call Westminster Animal Control at (714) 898-3311, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m., seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
You should also look for your pet at the Orange County Humane Society, 21632 
Newland St., Huntington Beach, or call (714) 536-8480. This is a private 
veterinarian's facility that Westminster now contracts with for animal shelter 
services. I also suggest that you call Seal Beach Animal Control at (213) 
431-2541. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in or near Costa Mesa and are missing or have found a pet, you 
should call Costa Mesa Animal Control at (714) 754-5311. Costa Mesa pets are 
taken to the Bayshore Animal Hospital, 2077 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa. The phone 
number is (714) 646-3800. Westminster and Costa Mesa residents, and those of 
their bordering cities, should be sure to look at the above facilities in 
addition to the county animal shelter at 561 The City Drive, Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this change will undoubtedly cause the killing of many pets 
while owners are looking at one facility and their pets are being housed or 
killed in another. An owner's identification tag should always be on your dog 
or cat. For one month, UHOC is offering readers a superior Formica ID tag at 
our cost. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to UHOC, 8921 Blackheath 
Circle, Westminster, Calif. 92683, and we will mail you an order blank 
immediately.

CUTTING FUNDS FOR THOSE WHO HELP ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the Costa Mesa City Council ruling to take back funds from nonprofit groups 
that provide services to illegals (except medical and dental): 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision, following so closely on another, similar one (denial to 
renew lease of the Share Our Selves center) clearly shows that the three men on 
our Council aim to get rid of all "undesirables" -- first the homeless, now the 
illegal aliens. The frightening question is: Who's next? Members of a 
particular race maybe? Or creed? Or even affiliation? 
</P>
<P>
But let's assume the target is illegal aliens. Does Orville Amburgey really 
believe that someone would trek all the way from Guadalajara because he's heard 
that in Costa Mesa he can get a free bowl of soup? Isn't it rather because he 
heard that here he can get employment? 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Amburgey, Peter F. Buffa and Ed Glasgow, wouldn't it be a better 
idea to close all the businesses rather than the soup kitchens? I'm sure that, 
as members of the Chamber of Commerce, you'd be at the source to implement a 
speedy cessation of commerce in the city, thus getting rid of illegal aliens as 
well as the worry of how to distribute the taxpayers' money in one inspired 
swoop! 
</P>
<P>
No, Amburgey, as a fellow Republican, I resent your idea of setting yourself up 
as an instrument for the U.S. Congress 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
As a business owner and resident of Costa Mesa, I agree with Mary Hornbuckle to 
leave the implementation of immigration policy to the federal government and 
that your job, as a council member, is to keep our city healthy, prosperous and 
humane. Or all the glorious Performing Arts Centers and glittering shopping 
malls will not hide the fact that "Costa Mesa, City of the Arts" is on the fast 
road to becoming known as "Costa Mesa, City Without Heart"!

CUTTING FUNDS FOR THOSE WHO HELP ILLEGAL ALIENS

<TEXT>
<P>
Well, three cheers for good ol' Costa Mesa! Imagine any city having the courage 
to put its citizens' rights ahead of the freeloaders who not only come 
uninvited to the table, but demand dessert as well. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged, indeed. Many of us have long been outraged at the gall and greed of 
the interlopers who expect us not only to support them, but also whine when we 
don't love them. 
</P>
<P>
Our homeless problem can be attributed directly to the law-breaking illegals 
who grab all the low-cost housing, thus depriving our own people of the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Let other cities take heart and follow suit by denying taxpayer funds to the 
illegals, and maybe they will stay home and help their own country.

What has happened to Costa Mesa's leadership? As a resident for 22 years, I saw 
Costa Mesa as a city of creativity and compassion in dealing with typical 
problems facing all cities in Orange County. Now, with the leadership of Mayor 
Peter Buffa, Costa Mesa is seen by many as racist. With its decision to stop 
granting federal funds to any agency that serves "illegals," Costa Mesa has 
taken another step backward. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Orville Amburgey, in his continual drive to try to push SOS out of 
the city, sponsored an ordinance that affects a lot more than those helped by 
SOS. Many think Amburgey bit off more than he can chew. 
</P>
<P>
All agencies that receive funds are now required by the city to check those 
they serve for legal status. That includes organizations that serve only 
children, the Lions Club, which sponsors an annual fish fry, and even the 
Newport Mesa Unified School District, which received $65,521, as stated in the 
Times chart of grant recipients. That means that Costa Mesa has ordered the 
district to check the legal status of every 5- to 18-year-old child that enters 
school, an issue that constitutionally has already been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the new bureaucracy created for all the agencies. Perhaps we should 
have Buffa, Amburgey and Glasgow IDs before anyone can come in. 
</P>
<P>
SOS rightly refused to adhere to such a ridiculous and inhumane policy, and it 
can afford to turn down its city grant, which is just a trickle in its flow of 
annual donations. But can other, smaller agencies afford the cut? Local 
agencies should wake up to the fact that Amburgey's personal attack on SOS has 
caught them in the line of fire, and they should unite in opposition against 
this new city ordinance. And all registered voters should remember these 
councilmen who constantly interfered with the running of private service 
organizations and who opened a dark hole in Costa Mesa's caring past. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget Buffa. The fearless leader who slyly sits back and agrees to 
all this nonsense. We all know Amburgey and his clone, Glasgow, will never 
change. But what motivates the major? 
</P>
<P>
Those in Newport Beach should remember, too, in case Buffa ever seeks higher 
office.

DANNEMEYER ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One can't help but be struck by the contrast between two articles that appeared 
in the Aug. 4 Orange County Edition of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
On the front page of your newspaper appeared the very positive article 
reporting the results of a new study that shows the significant effect of the 
drug AZT when used as an early intervention treatment program for persons with 
AIDS-related complex. Because of the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal AIDS 
chief, renewed his call that persons at risk undertake the AIDS antibody test 
to see if they are HIV-positive, and, if so, to possibly begin early drug 
therapy, which might prevent or delay the onset of full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the front page of Part II appeared a report about the current 
activities of our infamous Orange County congressman, William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton). By threatening to legislatively withhold federal funds, he wants 
to force states to require the reporting of names of all persons who test 
positive for the virus causing AIDS. He is now attempting to do at the federal 
level what he failed to do last year at the state level when California voters 
overwhelmingly rejected Proposition 102. 
</P>
<P>
As Fauci and every knowledgeable, reputable figure in our public health system 
has warned, such a reporting policy would discourage people at risk from taking 
the test and would be completely contrary to exactly what Fauci calls for in 
the front-page article. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear once again that Dannemeyer is not really interested in public 
health or in the prevention of the spread of AIDS. His true interest is his 
political and religious agenda of zealotry.

MISSION VIEJO INVITATIONAL SOCCER TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HAWKS BEAT JUST-UNITED ORANGE UNITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Manulkin got the call Thursday night. It was his youth soccer coach with 
news that the season was starting early -- as in early the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Manulkin, 14, had just returned from a Lake Arrowhead vacation with his 
parents, and he hadn't played soccer since February. But Friday morning he was 
one of 11 Orange United players competing in the Mission Viejo Invitational 
Soccer Tournament. Eleven players -- the bare minimum for soccer -- were all 
Orange United coaches could round up after they were asked Thursday morning to 
replace a team that had canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Fisher got the call Friday night after returning from a week of 
cross-country training in Mammoth. With Fisher, who will be a sophomore at 
Villa Park High School in the fall, and with a couple of other players added, 
Orange United had the luxury of a few substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
However, it still wasn't the same team that was the under-16 runner-up in the 
California youth soccer championships this year. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Gary Manulkin, Tom's father and an "assistant-assistant coach," 
seemed a bit surprised Saturday afternoon that the team even had a chance to 
advance to the tournament's final. Orange United went into Saturday's game 
against the Diamond Bar Hawks knowing that the winner would advance to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
On the sideline, watching the second half of the game against the Hawks, the 
elder Manulkin explained that practice was scheduled to start Monday for his 
son at Mater Dei. Martin Stringer, the Monarchs' soccer coach, was planning to 
put the team through a week's conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"That was going to be our hell week," Manulkin said. "Instead this is our hell 
. . . " His sentence was cut short by his own yelp and cheers for the first 
goal of the game, by Orange's Alex Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
After Freddy Romo scored to put Orange ahead, 2-0, there was a excitement on 
the Orange sideline. Orange United beat Diamond Bar in the semifinals of the 
state tournament this year, but a victory in this tournament would have been 
considered an upset. 
</P>
<P>
But the upstarts were stopped quickly by Diamond Bar. Three Hawk goals in about 
six minutes ended Orange's chances. Manulkin, the player, watched the three 
goals from the sideline, fearing that he had pulled his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Going for its second consecutive Mission Viejo Invitational Championship, 
Diamond Bar will play the North Huntington Beach Football Club at 2 p.m. today 
at the Mission Viejo Lake Youth Athletic Park in the under-16 division. Orange 
United will play the Junior United Soccer Assn. Banditos at 9:15 a.m. for third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' under-19 semifinal round today, the North Huntington Beach 
Football Club will play Cal Express at 8 a.m. and the Corinthians will play 
Mission Viejo Pateadores Gold at 9:15 a.m. In the girls' under-19 semifinal 
round, the Shooting Stars will play Mission Viejo United at 8 a.m. and the 
Villa Bratz will play the Football Club Heat at 9:15. 
</P>
<P>
Finals will be at 4 p.m. today.

JULY TOURISM SHINES IN SAN DIEGO DURING AN OTHERWISE LACKLUSTER YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turnstiles whirled in July at most local tourist attractions -- the best month 
so far in an otherwise lackluster year for the local visitor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry experts are hoping the spurt in attendance will continue 
throughout the summer to brighten what has otherwise been a disappointing year 
-- at least when contrasted with the last few years, which were glorious for 
local hotels, theme parks and other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Although both total number of visitors and tourist spending in San Diego 
increased since last year, traditional hot spots such as the San Diego Zoo, Sea 
World and Cabrillo National Monument showed diminished drawing power in the 
early part of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Through June, San Diego attracted 16.4 million visitors who spent $1.4 billion. 
Those numbers represent a 2.6% increase in visitor attendance and a 1.7% rise 
in spending over the same period last year, according to the San Diego 
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
But the zoo drew only 2 million visitors through Aug. 6 -- a 15.5% drop from 
the same period last year. At Cabrillo National Monument, 1989 attendance 
figures through July were down 11% from 1988, with only 917,638 paying 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
And, although attendance at Sea World has held steady with last year's, the 
theme park's gate has been inflated somewhat by free admission passes and 
widespread discounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition From Disneyland 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say they are perplexed by the season's sluggish start but 
agree that a combination of factors, rather than a single cause, has stunted 
tourism growth. Those factors include stiff competition from other major 
Southern California amusement parks such as Disneyland and Universal Studios, 
both of which opened new attractions this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors, tourism officials said, were higher gasoline prices and the late 
opening of new exhibits at local attractions. For example, this year, the San 
Diego Zoo opened its Sun Bear Forest exhibit July 1, much later in the year 
than the zoo's unveiling of Tiger River in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But industry followers say it's inaccurate to label this season as a 
disappointment and argue that contrasting 1989 with recent years is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to describe the tourism season so far is to say that we've been 
holding our own," said Al Reese, a Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau spokesman. 
"Now, if we don't show improvement over the previous year every time, some 
people say that's bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not necessarily true, because we have already achieved a high level 
of tourism success. So holding at that plateau doesn't mean something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Both 1987 and 1988 were banner years for tourism. In 1987, the San Diego Zoo 
drew 3.8 million visitors, Sea World lured 3.7 million patrons and Cabrillo 
National Monument welcomed 1.8 million, all record attendance figures. Last 
year, the "Big Three" drew crowds that were almost as high. 
</P>
<P>
With local attractions recently unveiling their new summer shows, tourism 
boosters are now hoping that the attractions can match the record-setting pace 
of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although overall countywide hotel occupancy through the first half of 1989 was 
down 3.3% from last year, rates at San Diego's most popular sectors -- La 
Jolla, Pacific/Mission Beach and Old Town -- increased in June. According to 
Pannell Kerr Forster consultant Bill Seymour, the gains are especially 
significant because they occurred during a hotel building boom. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy was up 14% in Old Town over 1988, 9% in La Jolla and 11% in 
Mission Bay/Pacific Beach. And countywide, hotel occupancy in June increased 
over last year, from 68.4% to 69.4%, or 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that demand is keeping pace or is even ahead of the increasing 
building supply," Seymour said. And he projected that hotel occupancy for 1989 
should hit 70%, comparable to last year's 70.4%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4.6 Million Room Nights 
</P>
<P>
According to a Laventhol &amp; Horwath report, June was the best month of the 
year so far for hotel/motel room nights sold -- 799,808, up 6.7% from last 
June. More than 4.6 million hotel/motel room nights were sold in the county 
through the first six months of the year, up 1.6% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel building has been big business in San Diego recently, as hoteliers await 
the overnight visitors expected to flock to the San Diego Convention Center 
when it opens in November. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of hoteliers are eagerly awaiting the opening of the convention center 
so they can fill the empty rooms they currently have," said Max Schetter, 
director of the Economic Research Bureau for the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Other tourist indicators provided by the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau 
confirm industry analysts' mixed review of the first half of 1989: 
</P>
<P>
* 812,109 visitors used Mission Bay Park, down 8.7% from last year's 889,616. 
</P>
<P>
* 2,918,794 visitors went to Old Town State Park, up 11.2% from last year's 
2,625,797. 
</P>
<P>
* 1,158,692 patrons visited major museums, down 4.2% from last year's 
1,208,905. 
</P>
<P>
* Through June, 2,636,278 passengers have arrived at Lindbergh Field, up 2.2% 
from last year's 2,578,830 arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego's major attractions, such as the zoo, aren't faring well so far 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although concerned about the 15.5% drop in zoo attendance through Aug.6 -- more 
than 80% of the Zoological Society's budget comes from tourists' dollars -- zoo 
spokesman Jeff Jouett says comparisons against last year are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's attendance numbers in 1988 were skewed, Jouett said, because they 
included the exhibit of giant pandas from China in January and February. 
"People wanted to see them before they left," Jouett said. "The pandas drew 
huge crowds." 
</P>
<P>
The zoo also opened its Tiger River exhibit at the end of March, 1988, enabling 
it to pull in added visitors for most of last year. The zoo only opened this 
year's new exhibit, the Sun Bear Forest, on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, because of the late opening, we haven't had the same impact," 
Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with the opening of the Sun Bear Forest, the zoo pulled in 436,141 
visitors in July -- down 7% from last year's attendance but about equal to the 
436,344 visitors recorded in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's tourism rally may still be stalled by the big tourist guns of 
Southern California: Disneyland and Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"This year the competition is even more intense with Splash Mountain opening up 
at Disneyland and with Universal's Earthquake," Jouett said. "They're both big 
draws, and those organizations have spent lots of money to spread the word 
around to create an urgency to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Such competition, however, isn't the only thing disturbing zoo officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easterners Stay Away 
</P>
<P>
According to the zoo's exit surveys, the number of "Easterners" -- visitors 
east of the Rocky Mountains -- visiting the zoo has declined noticeably. 
Through June of this year, only 424,000 of the zoo's patrons were Easterners. 
From 1986 to 1988, the zoo averaged 506,000 Easterners. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most significant area of decline according to our exit surveys," 
said Jouett about the 20% drop in Easterners' attendance. "But whether that's a 
market-wide phenomenon or whether it's just peculiar to the San Diego Zoo and 
Wild Animal Park, we can't reliably say right now." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said such a decline could mean that San Diego is slipping from a tourism 
pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, Southern California has basked in 
the tourism spotlight," Jouett said. "There are highs and lows in the tourism 
trade, popularity goes in cycles. We may be coming off a peak, or it just might 
be a temporary setback," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett, like others in the industry, says it is difficult to definitively say 
how the season is faring. For example, although zoo attendance is down, the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park is attracting big crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Through Aug.6, the park has drawn 755,000 -- up 8% from the same period last 
year when 697,000 visitors passed through the turnstiles, an increase Jouett 
attributes to special circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of babies -- gorilla babies, cheetah babies -- and we opened a 
stork exhibit," Jouett said. "We've been advertising the babies, and we think 
that's been bringing in more people." 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start earlier this year, Sea World is also witnessing an 
attendance pickup. Through Aug. 6, 2.4 million visitors entered Sea World -- up 
9% from last year's 2.2 million attendance figure, said Sea World spokeswoman 
Corinne Brindley. Summer figures are even more impressive: from June 24 to Aug. 
6, Sea World pulled in 1,023,000 visitors -- up 16.1% over last year's 881,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Sea World officials acknowledge that this summer's figures are somewhat 
inflated, in part because of free summer nights passes and discount coupons 
widely available at gas stations, convenience stores and other retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brindley, a summer nights pass -- a promotion that began June 24 
-- is given to each paid entrant, allowing the visitor unlimited admission to 
Sea World after 5 p.m through Sept. 4. As of Aug. 6, 64,000 people have visited 
the park with the free pass, Brindley said. In addition, Sea World's 
traditional coupon campaign is offering a variety of discounts -- including $4 
off the $21 adult admission price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Boost Sale Price 
</P>
<P>
Sea World's parent company, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, has good reason to try 
to boost the gate: it is in the process of selling the San Diego Sea World and 
five other theme parks, and the sale price could be enhanced by higher 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were all off to a slow start, but we're having an excellent summer 
season so far, and attendance has been very strong," Brindley said. "We have a 
strong line-up, plus Baby Shamu. A lot of people are coming for Baby Shamu." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials also attribute the increase to a variety of new shows, 
including an ice-skating extravaganza choreographed by Olympic champion Scott 
Hamilton and several nighttime shows featuring killer whales, sea lions and 
dolphins. Although usually open only until 5 p.m., Sea World has extended its 
hours until 11 p.m. since June 24. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cabrillo National Monument has been charging admission fees -- $3 per 
vehicle; $1 per pedestrian/bicyclist -- since March, 1987, the effect of such 
fees on attendance has become clearly evident this year. 
</P>
<P>
Through the end of July, 917,638 visitors have gone to the national monument at 
the southern edge of Point Loma, said Chief Ranger Howard Overton, an 11% drop 
from the same period last year, when 1,064,131 visited Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
"Visitation is declining slightly at this park, and we attribute the decline 
primarily to the fact that we're collecting fees now," Overton said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 to 1987, Cabrillo enjoyed annual attendance increases, reaching a 
peak of 1,772,037, Overton said. But the following year, in 1988 -- the first 
full year admission fees were collected -- the growth pattern, Overton said. 
Attendance dropped to 1,674,004.

Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, in a move to serve more of South County, 
has launched a $20-million fund-raising campaign for an expansion and 
remodeling program at the 15-year-old nonprofit hospital. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Ray, the hospital's executive vice president, said the hospital is 
considering adding up to 100 more beds to its existing 215. The hospital also 
needs a second catheter laboratory for the diagnosis and treatment of 
cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
Ray said that just a year ago, the medical center completed a $40-million 
expansion that included construction of a women's hospital and a medical office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
He added that last month the hospital opened a 15-bed cancer unit and obtained 
state licensing for its first pediatric beds.
