SACRAMENTO LIGHT RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A July 13 article on the performance of American rail systems erroneously 
quoted Sacramento's light rail ridership as 13,000 in contrast with projections 
of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in the final environmental impact statement, adopted just prior to 
the commitment to build the system, the federally approved weekday ridership 
forecast was 20,500. Current ridership is now over 21,000 daily boardings. 
Rush-hour trains are crowded; additional cars are under construction to expand 
capacity, and the system is generally considered a technical and political 
success.

STATE LAWYERS GET ON THEIR OWN CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA BAR PUSHES A COMMENDABLE ANTI-DRUG, ANTI-MISCONDUCT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is estimated that substance abuse is the cause of half of all misconduct 
cases handled by the State Bar of California. Faced with that frightening fact, 
its president, Alan Rothenberg, and his colleagues are backing a bill now 
before the state Senate to institute innovative programs for policing unethical 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figure that one out of 10 Americans has a substance abuse problem and 
there are 122,000 lawyers in the California bar, then as many as 12,000 may 
have a problem," reasons Rothenberg. "Even if it's only 5%, that's 6,100 
lawyers and that's too many." 
</P>
<P>
If Sacramento signs off on the proposed increase in dues charged to bar 
members, the professional association can step up chemical dependency 
counseling referrals and provide insurance to cover the cost of treatment, 
among other innovations. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be financed by the fee hike is a network of volunteer mentors who will 
help foundering attorneys nip potential ethical breaches in the bud. This 
first-tier disciplinary program would include continuing education on ethical 
concerns such as substance abuse and conflicts of interest, and on daily 
sources of stress such as office management and client-attorney relations. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill would not only work to prevent misconduct cases, it would 
also put muscle into the bar's in-house efforts to police the legal profession: 
The changes would for the first time allow the bar to reveal the names of 
attorneys under investigation if there is a compelling reason to publicize a 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys are realizing that they might save themselves time, money and bitter 
frustration through stepped-up in-house policing of a profession the public 
often perceives as inflexible and intractable. Resolutely implemented, the 
California attorneys' ideas could go a long way toward boosting their public 
image and conducting themselves more professionally, providing a model for 
other organizations that need to stop acting solely in their own defense.

PARENTING: THE BIOETHICAL ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
REMOVE THE PROFIT MOTIVE TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunning advances in the technology of human reproduction are proving to be a 
mixed blessing. Medical science now can address the age-old problem of 
childlessness; with wise choices and proper counseling, surrogate parenthood 
has the potential to bring satisfaction to couples who in the past would have 
lived out their lives without children. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, scientific advances have led to situations like the Baby M 
case in New Jersey where agreements went awry, where lives changed or where the 
men and women involved expected different results from a pregnancy. Wondrous as 
this new ability to manipulate nature may be, it is still new enough to be 
capable of taking the participants and the society at large in unforeseen and 
disturbing directions. 
</P>
<P>
The latest disturbing direction involves Orange County, where a surrogate 
mother, seven months pregnant, has sued to keep a baby she contracted to bear 
even though the fetus is entirely the product of the egg and sperm of a 
sponsoring couple. 
</P>
<P>
This troubling case involves a surrogate, Anna Johnson, unhappy over the way 
she says she has been treated by the test-tube baby's genetic parents, Mark and 
Cris Calvert, who claim to have willingly met their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
While the courts have yet to decide this case, it already teaches at least one 
important lesson: Surrogateship for money can be a legal nightmare, beginning 
with the decision to rent out a womb. Johnson, charged in July with fraud for 
continuing to accept welfare benefits while working as a nurse, fits a classic 
profile of a single mother whose poverty influenced her decision to become a 
surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
From the often super-rational perspective of the law, a California judge might 
easily apply a standard here similar to the one that prevailed in the Baby M 
case. The contract could be thrown out because it amounted to baby-selling, 
followed by some Solomon-like decision about custody and visitation rights, 
with due consideration being given to whether the surrogate somehow had a 
lesser claim because she did not provide the egg. 
</P>
<P>
Where would that leave society in human terms, those of considering the 
expectations of a poor mother and a hopeful couple? It seems absolutely inhuman 
to weigh the case solely in contractual terms when lives and the future of a 
family are at stake. But society's dilemma is that unless it can screen the 
participants and outline responsibilities beforehand, it inevitably will have 
to watch a judge deal with the results with the only legal tools at hand when 
something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What if a surrogate, succumbing to life's anxieties, develops a substance-abuse 
problem during pregnancy? Can the sponsors then compel an abortion to prevent a 
damaged baby from coming into the world? What if a surrogate decides that she 
does not want to carry the baby to term? Can the sponsors force her to give 
birth? 
</P>
<P>
Judges can review these cases, but what society really is asking them to do is 
wrestle another of the genies of science to a fall. A number of states have 
tried to do this with legislation, California not among them. Writing rules to 
cover any contingency will be difficult, perhaps impossible. 
</P>
<P>
There are no good answers. The best hope may be to find a legislative approach 
that would remove as much ambiguity and contention from these agreements as 
possible. Two important points: 
</P>
<P>
1) Contracts involving a profit motive for the surrogate are full of risk. 2) 
Volunteers are a plentiful enough alternative to commercial ventures; indeed, 
many surrogate pregnancies are done this way. But even in these cases, 
arrangements among friends can result in unanticipated disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
Only with careful provisions, adequate supervision and counseling can this 
promise of scientific advancement hope to produce satisfactory results in human 
lives.

SIN TAXES

<P>
It seems we are always looking for something new to tax. 
</P>
<P>
We have the cigarette tax, the gas tax and the 5 cents a drink tax on alcohol 
coming soon. These taxes are tolerated because they are punishment for doing 
something bad. 
</P>
<P>
I have an idea for a tax that will pass the burden to another sinful segment. 
It is the dessert eaters. Let's tax every helping of dessert 25 cents. We might 
even tax desserts with raspberries a little more. I don't care much for 
raspberries.

U.S. POLICY ON TEXTILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "U.S. Textile Policy Is No Bargain," editorial, Aug. 6: 
</P>
<P>
As a domestic manufacturer of women's dresses and sleep wear, we have no 
problem competing in the world marketplace so long as we are faced "with a fair 
competitive environment." We employ over a hundred sewing machine operators, 
cutters and other related textile professionals in our plants in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that we along with hundreds of other manufacturers who strive to 
make high-quality products which offer value to the consumer are facing an 
unfair competitive environment. Why? Because California just increased the 
minimum wage to $4.25 and because of other benefits which we must provide for 
employees such as Social Security and disability along with a myriad of other 
regulations which we must follow in addition to the non-regulatory but humane 
benefits such as vacation and health care. 
</P>
<P>
This is why we support the textile bill which is currently before the House 
which would restrict imports of textiles, apparel and footwear. The bill serves 
simply to make the competitive environment fair and equal because by limiting 
imports, it will help domestic manufacturers to pay for the regulatory burden 
which our overseas counterparts do not face. Overseas factories in Hong Kong, 
Singapore, India and other Third World countries do not have to provide the 
same wages, benefits nor comply with the myriad of labor, health and 
environmental regulations which California manufacturers are faced with. 
</P>
<P>
We pride ourselves on the "Made in the U.S.A. with love" label which is in all 
garments which we manufacture, and the fact that we recycle most material waste 
in order to be "environmentally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
However, in today's current California regulatory environment if the bill 
before the House on restricting imports is not passed, then the incentive will 
be for manufacturers like ourselves to shut down our domestic factories, lay 
off hundreds of workers and begin manufacturing overseas where we can employ 
"cheap foreign fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The textile bill plainly provides incentive for manufacturing jobs to stay 
within the United States and provides workers with a job and their dignity. 
Failure to pass the textile bill will continue the long-term incentive for 
apparel manufacturers to lay off their workers and shift apparel production 
overseas. The result will be placing of thousands of people on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial characterizes U.S. textile apparel makers as "fat, happy and 
complacent." We are "lean, mean and socially and environmentally responsible" 
and fighting for survival in a very competitive and tough economic environment.

<P>
I have just read the interview with Sullivan for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
I was unable to believe what I was reading in his responses to the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Seat belts and no smoking. What a fantastic leadership position. Also, no salt. 
Also many small businesses would sink with the oppressive need to cover their 
employees with some insurance for health. Oh, I am in pain. 
</P>
<P>
National health insurance is offered worldwide in industrial nations, but not 
here. Why not? The federal government does certain things well; others that it 
doesn't . . . that we have fundamentally a system that has been very 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Go tell that to the people that have to rely on the county and federal 
deliverance systems. They are in full failure. 
</P>
<P>
I've written to Dr. Sullivan. So what. I've now written The Times -- so what? 
</P>
<P>
I am at my wit's end to comprehend how far we have fallen as a nation of real 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Here's to Dr. Sullivan's charity hospitals. Woe is me.

GOP SHOULD WISE UP ON SOCIAL SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
SEN. MOYNIHAN'S IMPROVED FIVE-YEAR PLAN WOULD GRADUALLY RETURN MONEY TO 
WORKERS' POCKETS. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Moynihan ostensibly has applied the ointment of compromise to the abrasions 
caused by the budget unpleasantness. But he actually could be creating, from 
the unpromising material of his fellow Democrats, a serious opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan, the Senate's Sisyphus, recently applied his sore shoulder yet again 
to the rock that he has been trying to roll uphill. Months ago he proposed 
cutting, within just two years, Social Security taxes, putting the system on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. This would have shut the spigot from which now gush 
surpluses generated by the increases put in place in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Those increases were supposed to build "reserves" for when, around 2020, baby 
boomers retire. The reserves, now flowing in at $1 billion a week, are 
scheduled to rise to $3 billion a week in 1997 and even more after that. But 
they are being used to finance government operations, thereby masking the real 
size of the deficit. (The real deficit is forecast to be $241.8 billion in 
fiscal 1991, not counting the cost of the savings-and-loan shambles.) 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's aim was -- is -- to force honesty in budgeting and equity in 
taxation. However, his party, the conservative (meaning resistant to change) 
party, flinched from his radicalism and from the need to think (about equitable 
taxes to replace the Social Security revenues). But now comes Moynihan's 
compromise: Phase in the rate cuts over five years. 
</P>
<P>
For someone earning the maximum income taxable for Social Security purposes 
(about $54,300 next year), the savings during 1991-1995 would be $1,900. In 
1996, the wage earner would be saved $708. The tax rate would not rise again 
until 2010 and would not reach today's rate until 2015. Moynihan says 132 
million Americans are paying a rate that is a quarter of a century premature, 
on a tax that is inequitable in its current use -- financing the government's 
general operations. 
</P>
<P>
This tax, which for 74% of taxpayers is a bigger burden than the income tax, is 
regressive: It has a flat rate and is not applicable on income above $51,300. 
Because of the 15.3% Social Security tax on earnings (including the employer's 
portion), most workers in the 15% income-tax bracket pay a total tax rate 
higher than paid by the richest Americans. The richest are in the 28% bracket, 
but any income in excess of $51,300 is exempt from Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute notes that if fringe benefits, such 
as employer-paid health insurance, are thought of (as they should be) as 
income, then two workers with equal incomes can have significantly unequal 
Social Security tax burdens. A worker with $30,000 cash wages will pay $1,200 
per year more than a worker whose $30,000 in earnings include $8,000 in fringe 
benefits. That means a five-year difference of $6,000 in tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
If this regressive tax is not cut, by the end of this decade it will slurp up 
$200 billion a year more than Social Security will pay out that year. Moynihan 
says the money is not needed now for Social Security, so leave it with the 
workers who do need it: "The soul of the Democratic Party is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Talking about that party's soul is what philosophers call a category mistake, 
like talking about the wit of Brussels sprouts. But consider the political 
consequences if Moynihan's tax cut for 132 million Americans were to pass in 
September with the support of most Democratic senators and opposed by most 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
For a quarter of a century, since George Wallace got their attention, 
Republicans have celebrated Joe Sixpack, a fellow of hearty but simple 
appetites -- beer, not Scotch. The courtship of Joe Sixpack is going to be 
complicated enough if Republicans, busy campaigning for a capital-gains tax 
cut, vote against the cut in Social Security taxes. And that might not be Joe's 
only grievance. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the surrealism of Washington these days. The estimate of the number of 
S&amp;Ls that will fail has been doubled from 500 to (so far) 1,000. The Bush 
Administration cannot say, within half a trillion dollars, the eventual cost of 
this black hole for money: Guesses range between $400 billion and $1 trillion. 
And while these big numbers are bandied about, Republicans have floated an 
itsy-bitsy idea for helping to reduce the deficit by just $50 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
(Perspective: $50 billion is less than the deficit number that will be 
increased by removing Social Security surpluses from the budget for deficit 
calculations. And $50 billion is half of the additional sum sought last week 
for this year's S&amp;L spending.) 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' bright little idea for nibbling at the deficit? A new tax 
adding 75 cents to a six-pack of beer.

REPEAL THE LAW THAT FOSTERS BIAS IN HIRING; 
</P>
<P>
SOMETHING'S VERY WRONG WHEN U.S. CITIZENS ARE DENIED WORK BECAUSE THEY LACK 
'GREEN CARDS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAUL YZAGUIRRE, Raul Yzaguirre is head of the National Council of La Raza,

article.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something momentous happened at last month's NAACP convention in Los Angeles, 
but in national media coverage, it got swamped by the more glamorous debate 
about African-Americans' role in Hollywood: In a courageous move, the delegates 
voted to call for repeal of the employer-sanctions provision of the immigration 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The move was courageous not because this is a difficult position -- the 
evidence is overwhelming that employer sanctions cause enormous levels of 
discrimination -- but because it required the NAACP to overturn previous 
policy. Under the leadership of Dr. Benjamin Hooks, the African-American 
community now stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Latinos in a mutual struggle to 
repeal employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions" is shorthand for the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act's 
holding employers responsible for determining whether employees are legal U.S. 
residents. Latino leaders knew in the early 1980s, when Congress was 
considering immigration reform, that this policy inevitably would lead to 
employment discrimination. We have since been proven right by more than a dozen 
studies by city, state and federal human-rights commissions. The evidence 
culminated in a report released last March by the U.S. General Accounting 
Office, in which 19% of the employers surveyed admitted to adopting 
discriminatory hiring practices directly because of employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Apologists for the present immigration policy have made specious attacks on the 
GAO's findings; Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) even dredged up an internal GAO memo 
that "cast doubt" on the methodology in the report. That had already been 
addressed by the GAO, and the memo's author ultimately approved the final 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these tactics have focused attention on numbers and methodology 
rather than on the hardship being inflicted on human beings. On the East Coast, 
Puerto Ricans applying for jobs are being asked for "green cards," which, as 
U.S. citizens, they cannot produce. ("Green cards" -- which are any color but 
green these days -- are issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to 
resident aliens.) Other U.S. citizens report being told to provide "INS 
registration numbers" before they can work. Hiring personnel are refusing to 
interview anyone who seems "foreign," locking Latinos, Asians and Caribbean 
people out of jobs before they get a chance to apply. 
</P>
<P>
If even one such incident were the result of a federal policy, the policy 
should be reconsidered. Given the widespread human suffering that sanctions 
have produced, repeal is a moral imperative. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that this discrimination results from employer "confusion." This 
"benign" motive for unlawful discrimination does not make the impact on Latino 
workers any less painful. The effort to educate employers about sanctions 
doubled last year, yet reports of discrimination increased. Some in Congress 
are considering proposals to educate 7 million more employers in order to fix 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Others suggest trying to expand our anti-discrimination laws. While welcome, 
this approach would have little practical effect; research shows that most 
discrimination victims are unaware that their rights have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, these "quick fixes" require that we embrace a law that creates 
wide-scale discrimination, clean up a tiny amount of that bias after the fact, 
and tolerate what's left in the name of border control. As the NAACP action 
confirms, this approach is inconsistent with the commitment to eliminate 
invidious discrimination in all forms. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of sanctions have precious little evidence that they are working. The 
number of undocumented migrants -- and tension at the border -- continues to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of this policy are unacceptably high, especially when so many 
Americans are paying with their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Once our society accepts laws that jeopardize the rights of one group of 
people, other such laws become permissible. The NAACP joins a number of groups 
that previously supported or took no position on employer sanctions, including 
the International Ladies Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing and 
Textile Workers unions. 
</P>
<P>
Congress should gather its courage, reexamine the issue of border control, 
recommit itself to the principle of equal opportunity for all Americans, and 
repeal employer sanctions.

Four men attacked an Irish graduate student at an automated teller machine and 
beat him to death with a baseball bat while six bystanders watched. Paul 
O'Meara, 29, a San Francisco State University student, died at San Francisco 
General Hospital nine hours after the attack, said police. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses who shouted at the thugs said at least six other people saw the 
attack at a Mission District bank machine, said San Francisco Police Inspector 
Art Gerrans. "One fellow grabbed him by the hair and another fellow grabbed him 
by the leg and all four proceeded to pull him back into a parking lot area," 
said Gerrans. The suspects fled down a side street and jumped over a fence to 
make their escape, Gerrans said.

PADRES FALL, BUT GWYNN JOINS CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn despises. It has 
happened each of the past six years, so you'd think he'd get used to this. But, 
if anything, the frustration only increases. 
</P>
<P>
He can't stand knowing that six weeks still remain in the season, and the 
Padres are all but mathematically eliminated from the National League West 
race, having lost Sunday, 3-2, to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
When you trail the Cincinnati Reds by 12 games, and have two other teams in 
front of you with 43 games left to play, precious few team goals remain. Oh, 
it'd be nice, the Padres say, to finish in third place, maybe even second. 
They'd consider it an achievement in self-respect if they finished the season 
with a .500 record, considering they're 56-63, and have only 17 home games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But realistically, the only race Padre fans know that's still remains alive is 
the one for the National League batting title, which Gwynn has captured each of 
the past three years, and four times in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's so much easier to play when you're in the hunt for a pennant," 
Gwynn said. "Everyone has so much more fun. Winning is what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
"But I go out in the outfield now, and I hear them saying, 'Come on, Tony, get 
a hit. We want another batting title.' 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm trying, I'm trying, but it isn't the same like it was in '84." 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1984 when Gwynn won his first batting title, hitting .351 with a 
career-high 71 RBIs, helping the Padres run away with the division and go onto 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since that celebratory year, the final six weeks of a season have 
meant little to the Padres. Let's see, at this time a year ago, they were 10 
games out of first place. In 1988, they were 11 1/2 back . . . 13 1/2 back in 
1987 . . . 13 back in 1986 . . . and eight back in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the same question emerging each year at this time is not whether 
the Padres can make a run for the pennant, but whether Gwynn can win the 
batting title. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has the opportunity of becoming the first National League player in 65 
years to win four consecutive batting titles. Rogers Hornsby was the last to 
accomplish the feat in 1920-1925 for St. Louis when he won six in a row. Honus 
Wagner also won four consecutive titles (1906-1909) with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gwynn too has a chance for immortality, although he realizes if he doesn't 
make a surge in a hurry, the batting race will pass him by. He trails Phillie 
outfielder Lenny Dykstra by 24 points, .344 to .319. 
</P>
<P>
The only hit Gwynn was able to obtain Sunday in front of the crowd of 22,627 at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium was his ninth-inning bunt single. Replays showed 
that John Kruk's throw beat him to the bag, and first-base umpire Mark 
Hirschbeck missed the call. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, it looked like it might be the call that would swing the game in 
the Padres' direction. They suddenly had runners on first and second, no outs, 
Jack Clark at the plate, and Joe Carter on deck. 
</P>
<P>
It took all of six pitches for Clark to hit a foul pop-up to Kruk at first 
base, and Carter to ground into a double play, ending the game, sending Padre 
starter Dennis Rasmussen, 8-12, to his eighth defeat in his last nine 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Wasted was Rasmussen's finest outing since June 26. He allowed just six hits 
and one earned run in seven innings -- facing 14 batters before allowing a hit 
-- but his throwing error in the seventh inning, followed by second baseman 
Roberto Alomar's fielding error, proved to be too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
And games such as these have left the Padres in the mess they're in, with 
Gwynn's chase for the batting title serving as the only suspense. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of Gwynn clearing off space on his mantel for another batting title 
this season appear as remote as Roseanne Barr bringing home a Grammy, but yet, 
this is Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone figured he was doomed in 1988, batting .246 on July 2, but there he 
was in the final 73 games, hitting .367 to win the title. A year ago, he 
trailed Will Clark of San Francisco by four points, but there he was again, 
obtaining six hits in his last eight at-bats to win his third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he finds himself with Dykstra sitting far ahead of him, and Willie McGee, 
Dave Magadan and Andre Dawson also in the way. 
</P>
<P>
So, why is everyone still pointing toward Gwynn, the man who just so happens to 
be batting .388 in his past 11 games? 
</P>
<P>
"I think because of what I've done the past six years," Gwynn said, "when 
people think of batting titles, they always think of me. I'm sure right now 
people are saying, 'Where's Tony at, where's Tony.' Then, it'll be, 'Here he 
comes, here he comes. Watch out for Tony.' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure on me because of that. It's almost like people come 
to expect it, and if I don't win the batting title, I had a bad year. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think that way at all. If anything, I'm thinking of 200 hits, 
because that's what I shoot for every year. If I get 200 hits, I know I can be 
proud of the year I've had." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn just so happens to be on a pace to finish with 208 hits and a career-high 
78 RBIs, but when you've won three consecutive batting titles, everything else 
tends to get lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say I don't wake up every morning and grab the newspapers just 
to see where I am," Gwynn said, "but if I get in the heat of it like I think I 
can, sure, I'll go for it. I don't think it's out of reach, because I really 
believe .335 will win the thing this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pressure might get to Dykstra (who went two for 13 in the series), 
but for me and Willie (McGee), it's not first and foremost on our mind. We've 
done it before, and we know we can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre third baseman Bip Roberts left the game after the seventh inning because 
of a possible epididymitis, an injury to the coil above the testicles. Roberts 
sustained the injury in the fifth inning when Phillie third baseman Charlie 
Hayes slid into third, with his foot crashing into Roberts' groin area. Roberts 
stayed in the game, but after two innings, he realized he was only hurting the 
team. "Oh, man, it just took my legs away right there," Roberts said. "It gave 
me a stomach ache. I just don't understand why a guy had to come in with his 
spikes up like that. I had surgery in that area in 1981, and it's been 
super-sensitive there ever since. . . . I didn't want to seem like a wimp 
asking to come out, but it never got any better." . . . The Padres left 12 
runners on base, and now have stranded 48 in the past five games. . . . 
...First baseman Rob Nelson of the Padres' triple-A club in Las Vegas was 
selected as the Pacific Coast League Player of the Week. He batted .500 (13 for 
26) with two doubles, six homers and 16 RBIs in six games. . . . Padre starter 
Andy Benes celebrates his 23rd birthday today.

DODGERS WASTE INSPIRATION; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ROOKIE OFFERMAN HITS A HOME RUN IN FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE AT-BAT, BUT 
THEY DON'T SCORE AGAIN IN 2-1 LOSS TO EXPOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Dodgers, knowing the first-place Reds had already lost Sunday, unveiled 
21-year-old shortstop Jose Offerman against the Montreal Expos. Offerman hit a 
home run in his first major league at-bat, had two other hits and stole a base. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers didn't score in the next eight innings after Offerman's home 
run and suffered a 2-1 loss that left them 6 1/2 games behind the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers left 11 on base, stranding runners on second and third with one out 
in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez (15-6), who lost his second decision in a row, worked out of 
jams for most of the game, giving up only a fifth-inning home run to rookie 
catcher Jerry Goff until the ninth. Martinez then gave up a one-out single to 
Dave Martinez and left with a 2-and-0 count on the next batter, Goff. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell completed Goff's at-bat by walking him, got a fly ball out, then 
gave up the game-winning single to pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete. 
</P>
<P>
The game left much of the Dodger Stadium crowd of 40,603 seeing visions of a 
bright future for Offerman, who received several standing ovations, but it left 
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda disgusted by the present. 
</P>
<P>
"You're . . . right this was a tough one," he said. "We had a chance to win it 
in the eighth inning, we had a . . . chance right there -- second and third, 
one out. Then (the Expos) get a (game-winning) hit with two outs. We just 
didn't score any runs, that's the answer to it. Ramon pitched good enough to 
win. We gotta win. We're not in the lead, (the Reds) are. We've gotta win and 
pray they lose." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez (10-8) held the Dodgers to seven hits in eight innings and 
struck out eight. Steve Frey pitched the ninth for his sixth save. The victory 
allowed the third-place Expos to stay within eight games of Pittsburgh in the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrete, the Expos' leading pinch-hitter with eight, said he went to the plate 
looking for a fastball from Howell and got one. He slashed it to center. "It 
helped that he started me with a curveball that was low. I had a better chance 
of getting the fastball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez, who made 128 pitches but said he wasn't ready to leave in the 
ninth, said, "Today was a very good game, tight game. Denny Martinez throws 
very good. We leave lots of guys on base." 
</P>
<P>
Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said his Martinez was a little sharper. "Both 
Martinezes were very good today," Rodgers said. "Dennis had a very good 
breaking ball, all his pitches were working well. Ramon didn't have his 
breaking ball -- it was fastball-changeup all day. Dennis has been our big man 
every year he's been here. It just goes to figure if we're going do something, 
it's going to be with him on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
In the first, the switch-hitting Offerman's first swing produced a pop foul, 
but third baseman Tim Wallach slipped while starting after the ball and it fell 
untouched. Martinez worked the count to 0-and-2, then came in with a 
split-finger fastball that Offerman hit over the 385-foot mark in right field. 
Offerman didn't have a home run at Albuquerque this year. 
</P>
<P>
As he touched home, he got a standing ovation, acknowledged the crowd with a 
pointed forefinger, then was called out of the dugout for a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous," said Offerman, who appeared less comfortable talking to the 
media than playing his first major league game. "Baseball is the same (on all 
levels). Yeah, I was surprised I hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez said the home run energized the Dodgers. "The other players were 
excited," he said. "I told him, 'Welcome to the big leagues.' That's the best 
feeling, to homer in the first at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
Offerman also made several good defensive plays and showed wide range. He 
finished three for five, but an afternoon that started out all smiles and 
high-fives finished with grumbles and low notes for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a great way for a youngster to start his career off," catcher Mike 
Scioscia said. "It's a shame we couldn't build on it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jose Offerman is the 61st player to hit a home run in his first at-bat, and the 
55th to hit one in his first plate appearance. The last player to homer in his 
first at-bat was Toronto's Junior Felix May 4, 1989. . . . Manager Tom Lasorda 
said Offerman will continue to see spot duty behind Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia made several fine fielding plays Sunday. In the first inning he 
caught Tim Wallach's foul pop while sliding into the screen behind home. And in 
the seventh he protected a 1-1 tie by keeping Tom Foley off the plate while 
handling Kal Daniels' throw from left field. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels was one of several Dodgers who didn't care for home plate umpire Jerry 
Layne's strike zone. Daniels struck out three times. . . . A three-man crew 
worked Sunday's game. Rookie umpire Mike Winters did not work because of flu. . 
. . The Dodgers and Expos played six consecutive one-run games here, with L.A. 
winning five. . . . Ramon Martinez lost for only the second time in 11 
decisions at Dodger Stadium this season. It was only the second time he has 
lost back-to-back games this year. . . . Kirk Gibson was caught stealing but is 
17 for 19 on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel, who didn't have an at-bat, has two hits in his last 20 at-bats, no 
extra base hits in his last 53 at-bats and has struck out 110 times in 106 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela now ranks eighth on the all-time Dodger list in victories 
with 138, having moved past Johnny Podres. Next is Claude Osteen at 147. 
Valenzuela, who has thrown 2,306 innings as a Dodger, needs 19 more to move 
past Sandy Koufax into eighth place in innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE LONG CHASE 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have gone to the postseason 12 times since moving to Los Angeles. 
However, they have never been this far behind after 120 games and still won. A 
look at their 120-game position during their first-place seasons and this 
season.

HANDLEY, BERTSCH WAVE IN CHAMPIONSHIPS

Hal Handley and Sonya Bertsch competed in as many or more heats than any other 
man or woman in the World Body Surfing Championships (WBSC) Sunday. They also 
caught the best waves and were the Grand Champions in the 14th annual contest 
at the Oceanside Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Both Handley, a 40-year-old research scientist from La Jolla, and Bertsch, a 
36-year-old elementary school teacher from Corona Del Mar, came out of tough 
age divisions to win their 15-minute finals. 
</P>
<P>
Each also won about $2,700 in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Desire," Handley said of his motivating facotr. "I've been trying to win this 
for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
Handley has been competing in the world championships since 1983, including the 
four years he spent obtaining his Ph.D. in cell biology from Virginia. During 
those years on the East Coast, Handley planned his vacations around the WBSC. 
</P>
<P>
Bertsch said being able to relax was her key. "I tend to get super hyper 
beforehand, and I blow it. I have to find a way to settle down, and the team 
(Muddy Creek) really helped me out." 
</P>
<P>
Handley, a division champ in '85 and '87, won three close heats Sunday in the 
35-44 division and defeated seven other age-division champions in the Grand 
Champion final. 
</P>
<P>
They were: San Clemente's Niell Kohlhase (65 &amp; older); Oceanside's Jim 
Enright (55-64); Summerland's Daniel Drown (45-54); Newport Beach's Jeff 
Stevens (25-34); Leucadia's Tim Casinelli (18-24); Cerritos' Todd Kennedy 
(15-17); and Cerritos' Vincent Trotter (12-14). 
</P>
<P>
Casinelli, a two-time Grand Champion, had the best four-wave score of the day, 
107, in the 18-24 final. Trotter tied Ojai's David Ford, 72-72, in the 12-14 
division, but won on the basis of the next best wave. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burnside of Palm Desert, the defending men's Grand Champion, finished 
second in the 55-64 division. Five-time Grand Champion Mike Cunningham of 
Gardena was eliminated in the men's 25-34 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Bertsch won the 25 &amp; older division final, 88-78, over two-time world 
champion Virginia Cartwright of Encinitas. Bertsch defeated San Clemente's Kris 
Kohlhase (18-24) and La Palma's Mailei Robinson (12-17) in the women's Grand 
Champion final.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PIRATES SHOW REDS THAT THE EAST IS STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds built their big lead in the National League West at the 
expense of the supposedly stronger East Division. 
</P>
<P>
When the Pittsburgh Pirates arrived in Cincinnati for a four-game weekend 
series Friday, the Reds probably thought that they had just about wrapped up 
the pennant. After all, they had a nine-game lead and a 36-19 record against 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning Sunday to send the 
Pirates to a 6-3 victory and their first ever four-game sweep at Riverfront 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The four wins not only solidified the Pirates' grip on first place in the East, 
it made the Reds wonder if they really had wrapped up the West. Their lead was 
reduced to 6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek, with help from Stan Belinda, became the league's first 16-game 
winner. Belinda bailed Drabek (16-5) out of a bases loaded jam in the seventh. 
Belinda gave up a two-run homer to Jeff Reed in the ninth, but got his seventh 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella wanted to rest his two overworked relievers, Rob Dibble 
and Randy Myers, in the series. But he probably wondered why he didn't use 
Dibble in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds trailed, 2-1, but the Pirates had two on against struggling Jack 
Armstrong (12-9). Bonilla hammered a hanging change-up for his 28th home run, 
and third of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"Dibble was ready. I chose to stay with Armstrong and obviously it was the 
wrong choice," Piniella said. "You've got to show some confidence in your 
starting pitching once in awhile." 
</P>
<P>
While Drabek is 7-1 since the All-Star break, Armstrong has lost six of his 
seven decisions since starting the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, who is only 6-5 against the East, is 10-0 against the West. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff King also homered for the Pirates, who have won seven of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
New York 10, San Francisco 9 -- Dwight Gooden earned his 13th victory at San 
Francisco. His pitching hasn't been too good, but the Mets give him more runs 
than any other starter in the majors gets -- an average of more than seven runs 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds hit two home runs and drove in six runs for the Mets, who 
remained two games behind Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets took a 10-2 lead, but Gooden couldn't make it through the sixth. He 
left with one out after Ernest Riles hit a pinch grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell hit his 27th homer in the ninth and the Giants had the tying run 
on third when Jose Uribe grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Atlanta 4 -- His parents had spent three weeks watching rookie 
catcher Hector Villanueva play in the majors and were scheduled to return to 
Puerto Rico today. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva made their stay worthwhile when he hit a two-out, two-run homer in 
the eighth inning at Chicago to give the Cubs the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been disappointed because they hadn't seen me play much," Villanueva 
said. "They'll go home happy now." 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva's seventh homer made a winner of Greg Maddux (11-10), who gave up 11 
hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Houston 3 -- With Pedro Guerrero hurt and Ozzie Smith needing a 
rest, it didn't seem likely that Jose DeLeon was likely to end a two-month 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis Walling, subbing for Guerrero at first, and Tim Jones, at short for 
Smith, hit home runs and DeLeon (7-12) ended a seven-game losing streak with 
his first win since June 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals scored just 17 runs for DeLeon in his previous nine starts, but 
broke through for 10 hits and six runs off Mike Scott (9-12) in five innings. 
Scott, who hadn't given up more than three earned runs in his previous seven 
starts, yielded three runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman walked, stole second, moved to third on a fielder's choice by 
Terry Pendleton and scored on Willie McGee's infield single. 
</P>
<P>
Walling followed with a 419-foot homer, his first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, San Diego 2 -- Dennis Rasmussen, who had lost seven of his last 
eight decisions, had a 2-1 lead with one out in the eighth inning and it 
appeared that he would win at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But his poor defense contributed to his defeat. With a chance at a double play, 
he fielded Dickie Thon's grounder, but threw wide of second base. Then, second 
baseman Roberto Alomar bobbled a grounder to load the bases. Finally, Sil 
Campusano, batting only .192, hit a pinch-single to score two runs. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE JUMP ISN'T A PROBLEM FOR TELFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The usual route to the majors for a pitcher is through triple A, the highest 
minor league classification. As a rule, pitchers require more time in the 
minors than position players do. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles, however, have had success bringing up pitchers from 
double A. 
</P>
<P>
They did it with reliever Gregg Olson, and last season he was the American 
League rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, they brought up Anthony Telford from Hagerstown (Md.), their 
affiliate in the double-A Eastern League, so he could start Sunday's game 
against the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Telford, the former San Jose State star, held the Athletics to one hit in seven 
innings and the Orioles won, 3-2, ending a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken and Joe Orsulak hit home runs for the Orioles to give the rookie a 
3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They brought Olson in to pitch the ninth. Although he gave up a two-run homer 
to Mark McGwire, Olson was credited with his 28th save. It was McGwire's 32nd 
homer and the first hit off Olson at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Telford, a 24-year-old right-hander who was Baltimore's fourth-round pick in 
the 1987 draft, had a 10-2 record and a 1.97 earned-run average at Hagerstown. 
He had a no-hitter until Terry Steinbach looped a single to center with two out 
in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous, but Oakland had never seen me, so that was an 
advantage. They didn't know what to expect," Telford said. "I was just trying 
to do the best I could to keep us in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Telford who was called up to replace injured Dave Johnson, started the season 
at Class A Frederick, Md., where he was 4-2 with a 1.68 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched in only one game in 1988 before undergoing surgery on his right 
shoulder. He returned 15 months later, and was 2-1 with Frederick last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous effort," Oriole Manager Frank Robinson said. "He showed a 
lot of poise and savvy -- he made some pitches when he had to make them. He 
kept them off balance. That's what pitching is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa also praised Telford. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very effective," La Russa said. "He showed a good variety, good 
location and different speeds." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 9, Minnesota 1 -- When the Twins won the World Series in 1987, they 
were almost unbeatable at home. The noisy Metrodome was given much of the 
credit for their success that season. 
</P>
<P>
But, as they wallow in the cellar in the West this season, the Twins don't have 
a home park edge. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have made themselves at home there. When the Twins made two 
errors to help the Blue Jays score six runs in the seventh inning, it enabled 
the Blue Jays to sweep the six-game season series at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins had a 1-0 lead over David Wells (9-3) when a single and errors by 
shortstop Greg Gagne and pitcher Mark Guthrie put Toronto ahead. Mookie 
Wilson's two-run double broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is batting .424 against the Twins this season, also had a two-run 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
The third win in a row kept the Blue Jays in a virtual tie for first with 
Boston in the East. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Seattle 1 -- On the day before owner George Steinbrenner is 
supposed to be swept out of office, the Yankees completed their first home 
sweep of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leary (7-15) won for the first time in 10 starts at Yankee Stadium. The 
former Dodger right-hander gave up six hits in seven innings to end his 0-6 
record at home. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Geren hit a two-run homer off Matt Young, another former Dodger, in the 
fifth to give Leary the support he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Guetterman pitched a scoreless eighth and Dave Righetti retired the last 
three batters for his 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 7, Kansas City 2 -- Darryl Hamilton singled twice, stole two bases 
and scored two runs at Milwaukee to support the three-hit pitching of Mark 
Knudson (9-6). 
</P>
<P>
About the only Royal who presented a problem for Knudson was George Brett. 
Brett, continuing his late-season hitting splurge, had two of the hits and 
drove in both runs with his 10th home run and a single. 
</P>
<P>
The loser was Andy McGaffigan who had won three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Texas 2 -- The White Sox moved back to within 6 1/2 games of the 
Athletics with this victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Karkovice drove in two runs and Bobby Thigpen registered his major 
league-leading 40th save. Thigpen, Chicago's fourth reliever, pitched a perfect 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers put at least one runner on base in eight innings, but stranded 
seven. DAN HAFNER

Minnesota Vikings beat the Cleveland Browns, 23-20, in an exhibition game 
Sunday night.

<P>
Rich Gannon, the Vikings' third quarterback, guided the 14-play, 73-yard 
winning drive on his first series.

He set up the winning score by scrambling 18 yards on a third-and-20 play, then 
completing a five-yard pass to Andy Schillinger on fourth down.

<P>
Rice, who missed most of last season with a knee injury, scored on the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Gannon completed six of 10 passes for 51 yards on the drive, which gave 
Minnesota its only second-half points. He later ran for 19 yards on the final 
series, helping the Vikings run out the clock.

BLOCKER REACHES OUT, TAKES STARLING'S TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice Blocker, taking advantage of a five-inch height advantage and a 2 
1/2-inch margin in reach over Marlon Starling, won the World Boxing Council 
welterweight title on a majority decision Sunday at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time I went in to fight for the belt. This time I came to take the belt," 
Blocker said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Miguel Donate of Puerto Rico and Lynn Carter of New Jersey scored the 
fight 115-113 for Blocker, and Judge Chuck Giampa of Las Vegas saw it even at 
114-114. The Associated Press scored it 115-113 for Blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Blocker, at 6-foot-1, towered over the 5-8 Starling, but didn't hesitate to 
fight the champion inside. 
</P>
<P>
Blocker's only loss in 32 professional bouts was a 1987 decision to Lloyd 
Honeyghan for the WBC version of the title. Starling beat Honeyghan for the 
title a year later, stopping him in nine rounds. 
</P>
<P>
An unintentional head butt opened a deep cut under Starling's left eyebrow in 
the seventh round. His corner slowed the flow of blood between the remaining 
rounds, but the cut bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow first round, the fighters started mixing it up in the second. 
Starling (45-6-1) won the middle rounds on most of the scorecards, but faded in 
the last three. There were no knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Blocker, of Washington, D.C., was the No. 1 WBC contender going into the fight. 
He received $79,000. Starling, of Hartford, Conn., got $164,000. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked heavyweight contender Razor Ruddock of Canada overwhelmed Kimmuel 
Odum of Gary, Ind., and knocked him out in the third round of a scheduled 
10-round bout at Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Ruddock, 24-1-1 with 18 knockouts, floored Odum with a right uppercut and a 
left hook to the head with two seconds remaining in the round. 
</P>
<P>
Odum, 13-4 with 12 knockouts, couldn't handle Ruddock's continual pressure and 
scored only with short flurries that had little impact. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Rudy Battle deducted a point from Ruddock's score because he knocked 
down Odum with a left hook seconds after the bell ending the second round.

HAROLD ROBINSON WINS TRIATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KUTCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Robinson should have been distracted enough not to win Sunday's 
triathlon at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Robinson had to fight uneven, strong surf on the first leg of the 
triathlon, and then head winds on the bicycling leg. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even have his own hotel room the night before the event. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson, 27, of Santa Rosa, overcame the obstacles to win the triathlon in 
1 hour 57 minutes 47 seconds to win his first U.S. Triathlon Series event of 
the year. Brett Rose of Tempe, Ariz., was second in 1:58.58. He was followed by 
Andrew Carlson of Laguna Niguel in 1:59.23. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, Joy Hansen of Newtown Square, Pa., passed defending 
champion Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas to increase her lead. Entering the 
triathlon, Hansen held a 9.5-point lead over Colleen Cannon of Nederland, Co., 
who finished third. KIM KUTCHER

SHAKY COALITION REGIME FOLDS IN E. GERMANY

<P>
East Germany's first freely elected government collapsed in a cross-fire of 
political accusations Sunday, throwing the process of German unification into 
disarray, yet possibly accelerating the rush toward unity. 
</P>
<P>
In a move widely expected, the government's second-largest party, the Social 
Democrats, voted overwhelmingly to leave the coalition after Prime Minister 
Lothar de Maiziere accepted the resignation of two Cabinet ministers last 
Wednesday and fired two others, including Social Democrat Finance Minister 
Walter Romberg. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, leader of the Christian Democrats, the coalition's largest party, 
claimed the ministers were incompetent; the Social Democrats accused him of 
engaging in election politics by appearing to place the blame for East 
Germany's precipitous economic slide on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the behavior of De Maiziere, the Social Democrats have decided to 
leave this broken coalition," the party's chairman, Wolfgang Thierse, told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere labeled the Social Democrats' withdrawal as "a flight from 
responsibility." He said he would continue to rule as leader of a minority 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, the pullout of the 88-member Social Democratic 
parliamentary deputies leaves De Maiziere's remaining coalition partners with 
only 192 members in the 400-seat Volkskammer. 
</P>
<P>
It also raises serious questions about the future of a state treaty currently 
being negotiated between the two Germanys that would govern the terms of 
political unity, including such issues as financial assistance to the 
soon-to-be-created five new federal states that presently make up East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty is one of the few important remaining pieces of legislation facing 
the De Maiziere government, which is likely to disappear when political unity 
occurs, most likely within the next eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with East German state television late Sunday, Thierse said his 
party had yet to decide whether it would support the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if the treaty fails to get the required two-thirds majority vote 
in the Volkskammer, unity would still occur, but under terms of a simpler 
"transitional law" that would be passed by the West German Parliament, the 
Bundestag, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has a comfortable 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
With this method, however, the very process of political union would be 
completed with a dominant West German Parliament setting the terms of accession 
without direct East German participation -- an image that would only reinforce 
the reality that the fusion of the two Germanys is occurring far more as a West 
German takeover of the East than as a unification of equal partners. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and political analysts suggested that failure of the state treaty 
could backfire against the Social Democrats in all-German elections, officially 
set for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Kohl's chancery minister, Rudolf Seiters, pushed this point in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"A treaty is in the interests of the German Democratic Republic (East 
Germany)," he said. "If it doesn't go through, there will be no (East German) 
participation, and the Social Democrats must explain to the voters why." 
</P>
<P>
The level of financial support for East Germany upon declaring its accession to 
West Germany is a major point of dispute, both between East German parties and 
between the East German Social Democrats and Kohl's ruling coalition in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats have demanded sharp increases on current suggested West 
German proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an interest in a unity treaty but not at any price," Thierse said 
when asked about his support. 
</P>
<P>
The final round of treaty talks is scheduled to resume today in Bonn and De 
Maiziere said they would go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In what is also interpreted as pre-election jockeying, the Social Democrats -- 
now in opposition in both Germanys -- have resumed pressure to accelerate the 
timing of East Germany's formal accession to West Germany, with some 
speculating a formal legislative proposal for immediate unification could be 
tabled in the Volkskammer this week. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, leading Social Democrats have pushed for accession on Sept. 12, the 
date when the two Germanys and the four victorious World War II powers are 
expected to meet in Moscow to conclude the final round of talks on the external 
arrangements for unification. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and De Maiziere want unity to occur on Oct. 14, the date on which East 
Germany's five new states conduct their first elections. 
</P>
<P>
Early unity would allow the Social Democrats to focus on Kohl in the election 
run-up as the sole individual to blame for East Germany's economic difficulties 
and the rising costs of unification. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the treaty, the biggest potential casualty of the coalition's 
collapse is the image of democracy itself for a people tasting their first real 
freedom in nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Already upset by the drastic economic slide resulting from the sudden exposure 
of East Germany's antiquated, over-manned industry and farming sectors to free 
market Western competition following last July's monetary union, the unseemly 
manner of the government's collapse is likely only to deepen the 
disillusionment among East Germans, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
A survey published by the Bonn-based Infas Institute found only 27% of East 
Germans believe their government is doing a good job dealing with the country's 
problems, less than half the 56% figure registered in May. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts familiar with the conditions here, however, noted that the 
coalition's performance over its 130-day life has been credible despite its 
difficulties and eventual collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in with very little time, no experience and staffs they can't trust 
and have faced enormous problems," noted one Western diplomat here. "The 
amazing thing is that this burden has been carried as well as it has."

<P>
When Gene Brull moved to Robinson Street, it was a quiet lane on a Redondo 
Beach hill. Then one day, commuters discovered it made a fine shortcut to the 
San Diego Freeway and local office parks. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Brull couldn't back out of his driveway for fear of being broadsided 
by rush-hour road hogs. Children stopped riding bikes on the street. People 
started keeping pets indoors. 
</P>
<P>
So the aerospace engineer and father of three persuaded the city to make 
Robinson one-way. Now he wishes his life could be half as peaceful as his 
street. Brull's neighbors a block over are up in arms because the roaring 
short-cutters now cut past their homes. And for a while, he was even getting 
hate mail, computer-typed messages exhorting him to leave the neighborhood "or 
risk your health." 
</P>
<P>
Brull's is a tale from the front of what traffic engineers and city planners 
say is an escalating battle in car-clogged Southern California. As freeways and 
major surface streets reach capacity, more and more traffic is spilling into 
suburban neighborhoods -- pitting commuter against homeowner and block against 
block. 
</P>
<P>
From the rural byways of Malibu to Santa Ana's city core, from the broad 
boulevards of the San Gabriel Valley to the teeming Fairfax District of Los 
Angeles, freeway gridlock is leading more and more commuters on a quest for new 
and faster detours, traffic officials say. There are half again as many cars 
crammed onto the state's freeways today as there were 10 years ago, and the 
average 10-mile workday commute now takes 30 to 40 minutes -- 10 to 15 minutes 
longer than it took just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation also has led residents and local governments to rise up with 
a host of obstacles aimed at forcing short-cutters to shortcut someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, for example, the demand last year for speed humps to slow down 
short-cutters on residential streets ran so high that the city ended up paying 
triple what it had budgeted for such impediments and had to suspend its 
speed-hump program. In Orange County, spillover from the perpetually congested 
"Orange Crush" -- the junction of the Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove 
freeways -- has prompted a neighborhood in Orange to blockade its streets with 
concrete barricades. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the quandary over whether to extend Reseda 
Boulevard to ease shortcut congestion in Encino has been so emotional that a 
public hearing on the issue last year erupted into a fist-swinging brawl. In 
Beverly Hills, city staffers have embarked on an endeavor known as the Livable 
Streets program, aimed at protecting the neighborhoods south of Wilshire from 
cut-through traffic out of Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The list of shortcuts goes on and on, from the streets of Claremont offering 
rush-hour relief from the San Bernardino Freeway to the overrun byways around 
Dodger Stadium. The problem is so pernicious that traffic engineers have 
assigned it an official name -- Commuter Infiltration -- and have accumulated 
volumes of reports on how to rectify it: 
</P>
<P>
Barricades. Stop signs. Speed bumps. Speed humps. Man-made curves built into 
streets with big lumps of concrete known affectionately in the traffic trade as 
"elephant droppings." 
</P>
<P>
But still the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is like water," observed Maria Rychlicki, transportation planning 
manager for Beverly Hills. "It'll go where it can find a way." Shortcutting 
commuters have been a problem for decades in some parts of the country, said 
Dan Smith Jr., an Oakland-based transportation consultant who has co-authored 
two books on residential traffic management. In Michigan and New Jersey, for 
example, some cities have been experimenting since the 1940s with devices 
intended to divert traffic away from residential neighborhoods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there has been a lot more ferment in California in the last two decades," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason, he and others say, is simply that California has more cars. 
A report released earlier this year by Californians for Better Transportation, 
a highway lobbying group, found that traffic statewide has grown 55% in the 
last 10 years to 241 billion vehicle-miles a year. In the same period, the 
group reported, the miles of new road construction have increased less than 2%. 
Moreover, two-thirds of existing roads were found to be in fair or poor 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
In newer suburbs, streets are arranged so it is all but impossible for 
short-cutters to disrupt neighborhoods. Homes are built on cul-de-sacs that 
feed into so-called "collector" streets that, in turn, flow into major routes 
to and from office parks and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But streets are more vulnerable in older neighborhoods -- rural ones, for 
example, and those built on the standard grid pattern of streets popular in the 
post-World War II building boom. The crosshatch of streets in Gene Brull's 
neighborhood in North Redondo Beach, for example, offered an uninterrupted 
route to the massive office park dominated by TRW, one of the South Bay's 
biggest employers. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhoods erected during a quieter era in the Fairfax District of Los 
Angeles now abut the bustling Wilshire Corridor. And Malibu has in recent years 
complained about "Z-pattern" short-cutters -- commuters from Ventura County and 
northwestern Los Angeles County who avoid taking the Ventura Freeway into the 
central business districts by taking a Z-shaped route, east to Malibu or 
Topanga Canyon, south via the Pacific Coast Highway, then east again on the 
Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But cars, Smith believes, are not the only reason cities are doing battle 
against cut-through traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the California population, being new, tries to take more control of 
their environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best-known assault on "commuter infiltration" occurred in Berkeley 
in the 1970s, when the city erected $618,000 worth of signs, lights, barriers 
and other devices in an ambitious effort to keep cars on main arterials and 
away from neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The endeavor cleared some residential streets, but left the city politically 
polarized. Critics charged that the plan was anti-automobile paranoia. The 
barriers had been in less than a year when a physician -- whose seven-minute 
drive to the emergency room soared to 20 minutes because of the changes -- 
launched a ballot initiative for its repeal. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative failed, and, despite the years of litigation that ensued, most 
of the diverters installed by the city remain in place, said Dan Smith Jr., a 
traffic consultant who worked on the original plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Berkeley is still a tough drive in some places and not as bad in others," 
Smith said. But the Berkeley experience galvanized other California cities as 
freeway congestion began to spill over into neighborhoods never intended as 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot more consciousness about the problem now than, say, 15 
or 20 years ago," Smith said. "So even while traffic has grown a lot, people 
are also a lot more willing to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't to say that the solutions to cut-through traffic have become any 
less divisive. 
</P>
<P>
"The technical issues aren't the tough ones," said Dave Barnhart, Pasadena's 
city engineer. "It's the political consensus that's tough. We all want to live 
on a nice, quiet cul-de-sac with an on-ramp running into our garage -- we want 
to have privacy, but we also want to have access to the road." 
</P>
<P>
The little neighborhood in the southwesternmost corner of Orange understands 
the political problems only too well. Surrounded on two sides by development 
and freeways and equipped with a street system dating in some spots to the 
early 1900s, the little community once known as Pumpkinville found itself under 
virtual assault from the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
To the south was the massive MainPlace mall, one of Orange County's biggest 
shopping centers; to the west was the junction of three freeways. The major 
arteries were so notoriously jammed that the junction earned the nickname 
"Orange Crush." It wasn't long before the little neighborhood was awash in 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten million square feet of office space and one of the busiest intersections 
in Southern California," marveled Mike Spurgeon, chairman of the area's traffic 
committee. "And guess where all those people were driving?" 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the city erected signs blocking access to the neighborhood's south 
end, allowing drivers to get out but not in. The signs were so popular that, 
this year, the City Council voted to replace them with concrete barricades. 
</P>
<P>
But consensus didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some wanted all the streets open," Spurgeon said. "Some wanted everything 
closed. It took 4 1/2 years for us to get anything done because these 
neighborhood meetings turned into shouting matches." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Conner, assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Transportation 
Department, agreed that commuter infiltration "is a very emotional and touchy 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the meeting last August called by Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude to talk about San Fernando Valley short-cutters. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by cut-through traffic from the San Diego Freeway, Encino residents 
wanted to extend Reseda Boulevard to Mulholland Drive. The people of Tarzana 
hated the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to be debated on a Thursday night at an Encino elementary school. 
But the meeting hall filled before everyone who wanted to speak got a seat. 
Soon emotion superseded words. Outside, people began pounding on the windows 
and doors, and teen-age boys scrambled onto the roof to post anti-extension 
signs. The president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. got tackled in the 
melee. A boy from Tarzana hurt his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"We get fingers pointed at us. We get called names," Conner said. "People say 
we don't care, but we do. Our professional associations are constantly trying 
to come up with solutions to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has been particularly aggressive in its attempts to tackle cut-through 
traffic -- or slow it down, at least. By summer's end, 85 streets will have 
been equipped with 350 speed humps -- gently sloping mounds of asphalt about 3 
inches tall -- so many that the city had to suspend the program because the 
demand outstripped the budget for speed humps, Barnhart said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have flooded neighborhoods with stop signs and no-left-turn 
restrictions. Still others have built S-curves into straightaways with lumps of 
concrete and made it harder to turn into beleaguered neighborhoods by narrowing 
intersections with so-called traffic chokers. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, a citizens committee has been working with City Hall for the 
last two years on a 20-point program to rid residential streets of the 
downtown-bound Santa Monicans and the Valley-bound Brentwood commuters, traffic 
planning manager Rychlicki said. Meanwhile, back on the blacktop, the commuters 
continue to infiltrate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in fact, two Los Angeles writers published a novelty book of 
shortcuts through 90 of the city's most congested areas. Co-authors Brian 
Roberts and Richard Schwadel earned brief notoriety after homeowners around 
Lake Hollywood blamed the book for an onslaught of cross-town traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts said the little book has sold more than 7,000 copies so far. 
</P>
<P>
"People are frustrated out there. Everybody's looking for a better way," 
Roberts said. "If I have one more person call me asking for an Orange County 
book, I'll scream."

THE SOVIET UNION'S UNEXPECTED BUMPER CROP OF GRAIN HAS TURNED INTO TOO MUCH OF 
A GOOD THING. A LACK OF RAIL CARS AND STORAGE FACILITIES MAY MEAN MORE FOOD 
SHORTAGES.

<P>
The squinting, weathered watchman at the Korenovsk Elite-Seed State Farm 
surveyed the small mountains of grain surrounding him, spilling along the 
pavement under the beating sun, and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the bread is good this year," Nikolai Govorushenko said. "But there's 
nowhere to send it. The elevator won't take it, the storehouses won't take it. 
</P>
<P>
"May God hold back the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet farmers are blessed with one of the best harvests in memory this year -- 
260 million tons of grain, according to preliminary government estimates -- but 
the country's storage and transportation network cannot cope with the 
unexpected bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the summer's bounty, the Soviet Union again faces the prospect of 
worsening food shortages this winter. 
</P>
<P>
The probable loss of up to one-third of the harvest -- the difference between 
the country being able to feed itself or being forced to turn to expensive 
imports -- has prompted a desperate scramble among local and national leaders 
to get the crops in as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical president of the Russian Republic, issued an 
anything-goes appeal to citizens to do whatever it takes to bring in the 
harvest, promising that all those who help will receive special coupons 
allowing them to buy scarce consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
In Yaroslavl, 150 miles northeast of Moscow, authorities imposed a local state 
of emergency and vowed to get the harvest in even if it meant marshaling 
industrial workers, students and army units. 
</P>
<P>
By government count, only 150,000 urban residents are helping gather the 
harvest this year, compared to 700,000 in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov announced that the country would hold 
back oil it had planned to export, largely to Eastern Europe, and reallocate it 
to harvest areas suffering from drastic fuel shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, he said the government planned to send 10% to 15% of all 
vehicles belonging to the country's enterprises to help with the harvest and to 
put police, KGB and Defense Ministry personnel on the job as well. 
</P>
<P>
The country must make the harvest a success, Ryzhkov has warned on national 
television, because it cannot afford to keep importing tens of millions of tons 
of grain each year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Soviet Union spent sorely needed hard currency to import 44 
million tons of grain, but the government has warned that it does not have the 
cash to buy the same amount this year. Soviet officials have requested $2 
billion in credits from the United States to buy American grain. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not cardinally change the situation," Ryzhkov told a meeting of the 
government's top advisory councils last month, "the country will be in no 
condition -- and I state this responsibly -- to import grain in such 
quantities." 
</P>
<P>
In Krasnodar, a province in the northern Caucasus Mountains often likened to 
California for its natural riches and superb climate, railroad workers washed 
out more than 100 cars meant for carrying concrete, dried them and loaded them 
with grain instead. At the seed processing center of the Kolos experimental 
farm a few miles away, a garage was turned into a temporary granary. 
</P>
<P>
"More grain, more problems," said Alla V. Kubakhova, the center's agronomist. 
"There's just nowhere to put it." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, the tons upon tons of tawny grain lie out in giant mounds until 
trucks can be found to take them to local elevators and trains can be found to 
move them out. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one rain, it will start to rot, and if there are two rains about 
three days apart, that's it," said Govorushenko, the watchman at the Elite-Seed 
State Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Two million tons of grain is being lost each day because it is not gathered and 
stored fast enough, according to the Soviet Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Russia exported grain before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But since Josef 
Stalin eliminated private farms in his 1929-1930 collectivization of 
agriculture and replaced them with large collective and state farms, the 
country has had to struggle to feed itself. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has introduced a series of increasingly radical 
agricultural reforms aimed at making farmers work better by giving them the 
feeling that the land once again belongs to them and they will profit 
personally from bigger harvests. 
</P>
<P>
But food supplies have dwindled further, discrediting his policies and costing 
him more popular support than any other aspect of perestroika, his reform 
program. 
</P>
<P>
If the government cannot buy enough grain from the country's farmers and 
refuses to spend more hard currency on imports, there are dire predictions that 
there might even be shortages of bread, the staple of the Soviet diet. 
</P>
<P>
But an imminent catastrophe was hard to discern amid the towering sunflowers, 
flourishing beet greens and straight-standing corn in Krasnodar. With the peak 
of the grain harvest just past, the picture was one of widespread abundance, 
and officials here said Gorbachev's reforms were finally starting to work. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai I. Kondratenko, the head of the provincial administration in Krasnodar, 
said that in addition to perfect weather, the boom harvest reflected improved 
technology learned from the West over the past few years and the farmers' new 
feeling of being "masters of the land." 
</P>
<P>
The reforms have given farmers more control over their own fields but failed to 
solve the problem of how to get the increased produce to Soviet consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are now allowed to sign contracts themselves with produce-buyers 
instead of working through centralized ministries, but many of the contracts do 
not deal with transport and storage, according to Yuli N. Semenenko, the 
Krasnodar correspondent for the farming newspaper Village Life. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Semenenko said, the centralized planning system is breaking down, 
new direct market links are only now being formed and rail traffic, the Soviet 
Union's main means of transporting goods, is growing increasingly snarled. 
</P>
<P>
The general disorganization turned into crisis in the last week of July when 
partisans in the nearby Caucasus republic of Georgia blocked rail traffic in a 
political protest, paralyzing most of Krasnodar's rail lines for days and 
putting the grain in danger of further spoilage. They lifted their blockade on 
Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The region, known as the Kuban, also suffers from train shortages because cars 
that go into the restive Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia 
sometimes fail to return, and those that carry grain to the far reaches of 
Russia sometimes take weeks to get back. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the Kuban, some of the Soviet Union's richest agricultural land, 
got only about half the rail cars it needed during much of the harvest, 
according to the government newspaper Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the marble-fronted administration building of the Krasnodar regional 
railroad, in the anteroom of the acting chief of operations, occasional 
shouting could be heard through the thick door. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been standing idle for four days!" was one audible fragment. 
</P>
<P>
Arkady D. Tolstobrov, neat in a blue railroad uniform when he emerged from his 
office but also apparently exhausted by the long hours, said there is increased 
pressure on railroad workers to free grain cars for the new crop of sunflowers, 
a major source of cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for cars is growing," he said. "The problem is, we're supplying all 
of Russia -- it all wants to try our Krasnodar grain. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no time for sleep now. The main thing is to get out this grain. 
Nothing else matters." 
</P>
<P>
Trucks cannot help solve the problem because there are too few of them and 
gasoline is severely depleted as well, with many drivers waiting two or three 
hours in line to fill their tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Russian country roads are also notoriously poor, many still unpaved or with 
giant, axle-bending potholes, while most rail lines are at least adequately 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
At a railside elevator just outside the city of Krasnodar, a scale operator 
said tension was so high that drivers of grain-laden trucks had begun fighting 
over whose turn was next. 
</P>
<P>
"And myself, I didn't even have time to go to the bathroom," the operator said, 
plucking black seeds from a sunflower head and chewing on them. 
</P>
<P>
Added enthusiasm on the farm is also not enough to offset deep-seated supply 
problems that leave combines and other harvesting equipment rusting in the 
fields for lack of spare parts. Out of 700,000 combines in the country, 107,000 
were not ready for this year's harvest, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Govorushenko pointed out two large pieces of the Elite-Seed farm's machinery 
left rusting out in the sun. They cost thousands upon thousands of rubles, he 
said, but seemed to be good for nothing. "They spend money on machinery instead 
of the workers," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
One more complication for the overloaded grain storage system arose in the 
final days of July with the arrival in Black Sea ports of shiploads of imported 
American grains, ordered before the bumper harvest was assured. The expensive 
imported grain thus took storage space away from Soviet grain, national 
television reported. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one day, the Soviet television reporter added, those seaside elevators 
will once again be used for exporting Soviet grain instead of holding grain 
bought overseas.

LIGHT PLANES COLLIDE; FALL INTO OCEAN

Four people were killed when two single-engine planes collided in midair and 
crashed Sunday afternoon in the waters off the Long Beach breakwater, about a 
mile south of the Queen Mary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3:26 p.m. collision between a four-seat Cessna 172 and a Piper Turbo Arrow, 
also a four-seater, was witnessed by people aboard at least two vessels in the 
area, including a U.S. Coast Guard craft on routine maneuvers, Long Beach Fire 
Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boats was able to drop a buoy near the Cessna crash site. That 
marker guided rescue crafts, which were dispatched by the Long Beach marine and 
fire departments, to the site about 400 yards west of the Long Beach 
lighthouse, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of two men -- ages 21 and 50 -- were pulled from the Piper that had 
crashed inside the Long Beach Harbor breakwater, Caldon said. The 50-year-old 
was believed to be the pilot, authorities said. The victims were not 
identified, pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gennaro, a Downey plumber, and his son Franco, 17, were fishing aboard 
their 21-foot cabin cruiser just outside the breakwater when they saw the two 
planes in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked like they were doing stunts," said Gennaro, 44. "I thought they 
must have been from the Queen Mary or something. All of a sudden the prop from 
one plane chopped the wing off the other one. There was no explosion, no fire." 
</P>
<P>
Gennaro said the Cessna, with only one wing left, "just sank -- rapidly. Other 
debris fell into the water. We rushed over hoping to God there might be 
survivors. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Waning light and poor underwater visibility forced divers to call off their 
efforts late Sunday to recover two bodies from the Cessna that fell outside the 
breakwater, Caldon said. The search is to resume at dawn today. The National 
Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility has been the biggest problem," Caldon said. "Divers can't see three 
feet in front of themselves because of red-tide conditions. They're just 
groping down there." 
</P>
<P>
Caldon said the Piper went down south of Pier J, and "the water there is about 
60 feet deep," he said. "We sent several rescue boats to the scene and put 
divers into the water." 
</P>
<P>
Caldon said there was very little debris visible, except "an oil slick and some 
paper floating on the surface." 
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen divers, from Los Angeles and Long Beach rescue agencies, 
searched the waters for wreckage and victims, he said. The effort was "like 
finding a needle in a haystack for them, since they could only see the length 
of their arm," Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Divers also found some landing gear, including two tires, said Kristine 
Johnson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Gennaro said that an armrest, a steering wheel, papers, maps and other debris 
floated to the surface.

KGB ASSAILS EX-OFFICER RUNNING FOR SEAT IN PARLIAMENT

While Russians in the southern region of Krasnodar went to the polls Sunday, 
the Soviet State Security Committee and the Communist Party waged a propaganda 
war against one candidate on the ballot, cashiered KGB Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin. 
</P>
<P>
Kalugin was running for the seat in the Congress of People's Deputies, the 
national Parliament, that was once held by Ivan K. Polozkov, a powerful 
conservative who vacated it upon becoming chief of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation, largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
If Kalugin wins over 19 rival candidates, it will be a symbolic victory for the 
growing social democratic movement in the Soviet Union and another blow struck 
by the citizenry against the Kremlin powers that be. 
</P>
<P>
While Kalugin stumped for votes, KGB officials intensified their battle against 
the 55-year-old former chief of foreign counterintelligence. He is facing an 
investigation that could lead to criminal charges against him for disclosing 
methods and activities of the KGB, the Soviet security and espionage agency. At 
a Kalugin campaign rally Thursday, planes circled over the crowd and dropped 
leaflets in support of Kalugin's opponents, most of whom are connected with the 
Communist Party, including cosmonaut Anatoly Beregovoy. 
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, Kalugin drew large crowds to campaign speeches, during which he 
denounced the Communist Party's manipulation of society through the KGB and 
called for a free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
But in the countryside, his support appeared minimal. Two-thirds of the 
estimated 3 million voters in the area on the shores of the Black and Azov seas 
are peasants who traditionally have endorsed candidates from the Communist 
Party, who until last year were the only choices on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come to a rural area, I rarely see a peasant who supports me," Kalugin 
was quoted by the Reuter news agency as saying recently. "The people who read 
newspapers do support me." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the large number of candidates, election results were not expected 
before today.

A Panamanian tanker and a barge carrying more than 7 million gallons of 
gasoline and heating oil collided early Sunday, spilling 152,000 gallons of 
gasoline into Delaware Bay, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill left a light sheen of gasoline over a 2 1/2-mile by 200-yard area 
four miles from the mouth of the bay off Lewes. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said it expected the gasoline to dissipate by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Donald Gilbert of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Philadelphia 
said Sunday's high temperatures and rain later in the day were helping to break 
the sheen apart. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was not expected to threaten the Delaware or New Jersey shorelines or 
the two states' popular ocean resort areas. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said that a fish kill 
was likely, although none had been reported more than 15 hours after the spill.

DOZENS FLEE IN INDIANA AS RAINS PRESSURE DAM

Pounding rains swamped the Midwest and Great Lakes states Sunday, sending 
rivers over their banks in Wisconsin and Ohio and forcing evacuation of parts 
of Rochester, Ind., where officials worried that a dam might not hold. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, flash flood warnings were lifted in northeast and east 
central Ohio and in West Virginia, where storm systems dispersed and weakened 
during the late morning. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton County sheriff's deputies at Rochester, in north central Indiana, 
evacuated 28 patients from Woodlawn Hospital and about 50 residents of 
Waterhaven, a senior citizens' center, as a precaution in case the Lake Manitou 
dam failed. 
</P>
<P>
Water was spilling from the lake and officials estimated that if the dam should 
break, floodwaters would rise to six feet deep within about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, about 1,500 people were allowed to return to their 
homes at Tomah. Fear of dam breakage there caused their evacuation on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tomah Fire Chief Tom Flock said the dam held, although Tomah Lake had 
overflowed when more than eight inches of rain fell Saturday morning. About 250 
homes near the lake were flooded, streets were in disrepair and damage was 
estimated at $3 million, Flock said. 
</P>
<P>
A series of thunderstorms pushed through northern Illinois early Sunday and 
low-lying areas were flooded as the storms swept into Wisconsin. In Chicago, 
floodwaters were receding, and the carp that swam across Higgins Road on 
Saturday night returned to Higgins Creek on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Minnesota and northern Iowa also received heavy showers. Scattered 
storms hit parts of Oklahoma and Texas, where severe weather was reported 
southeast of Childress. 
</P>
<P>
In Ohio, slow-moving storms dumped up to two inches of rain on some areas in 
less than two hours, and some low-lying areas near Akron and Cleveland were 
flooded. Near Ashland, thunderstorms brought damaging winds, frequent lightning 
and heavy rains that overwhelmed drainage systems.

TRAIN WRECKS LEAVE TONS OF GRAIN, DELIGHTING GRIZZLIES. BUT, AS WITH ANY BIG

<P>
Grizzly bears are among nature's most determined opportunists, eating most 
anything and willing to fight most anybody in their way. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine in the spring of last year when the grizzlies of northern Montana 
awoke from winter's hibernation to behold an opportunity to end all 
opportunities -- an opportunity bigger and tastier than any famished bear ever 
fantasized. Imagine them awakening and finding more than 10,000 tons of grain 
corn dumped on their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"For grizzly bears it was like dying and going to heaven," said Forest Service 
District Ranger Allen L. Christophersen. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, however, it's been a hellish chore for man to clean up his spilled 
corn and hold off a hungry stampede of wild grizzlies, and a few black bears, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with a freakish series of train derailments during the winter 
of 1988-89 on the Burlington Northern line east of here along the border of 
Glacier National Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the first derailment, a westbound train coming down Marias Pass broke a 
wheel and sent 20 grain cars tumbling across the landscape. A month later, 32 
cars derailed when a track broke at the same spot. And then just days later, in 
a winter storm with howling winds and 30-below temperatures, a train lost its 
brakes and 52 cars full of corn came flying off the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
With each rail car carrying about 100 tons, the spills totaled more than 20 
million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The bears awoke in spring and began to assist in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers tell of 11 bears at any one time gorging on the mounds of corn. So 
blissfully content was one grizzly that it lay down on its side and simply 
scooped corn into its face until it could eat no more. 
</P>
<P>
Bears dined in the morning, napped and returned in the evening to plunder 
again. The booty was so vast that little bears ate peaceably right along with 
the big ones, and even some black bears -- which normally flee at the sight of 
the bully grizzlies -- came to join in the feast. 
</P>
<P>
As the corn ripened in the sun, some people worried about fermentation. Would 
the bears become not only fat and lazy, but drunk, too? 
</P>
<P>
Turns out, however, a bigger problem was not the bears so much as the bear 
watchers attracted to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Highway 2 from Hungry Horse to Browning runs only a few hundred yards from 
the spill, and no sooner did the snow melt than carloads of summer tourists 
arrived and joined the wrecked rail cars, the corn and the bears for a regular 
inter-species wilderness hoedown. 
</P>
<P>
It seems most everyone knows bears are unpredictable and dangerous. Well, not 
everyone. And coincidentally, those people who never got the word about bears 
all set out to travel U.S. 2. They pulled to the edge of the narrow mountain 
roads, yanked out cameras, lawn chairs, children, picnics. Oh what fun, that 
bear is only 50 feet away! Yeah, but see here -- that one is even bigger, and 
closer, too! 
</P>
<P>
Christophersen blanched. The bears were too near to the tracks and were in 
danger of being killed by trains. People were too near to the corn and in 
danger of being killed by the bears. 
</P>
<P>
Signs were posted to mark the whole area off limits: no stopping, no parking, 
no trespassing. A nearby campground was closed. Law enforcement officials 
cruised the remote scene to shoo away disbelievers and dispense tickets to a 
few rubberneckers. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy said: 'Hey, I'm a cop from Cincinnati,' " Christophersen recalled. "He 
figured that qualified him to handle a bear. I tell you, we heard every excuse 
there is." 
</P>
<P>
Burlington Northern began scooping out the corn, a job that is still going on 
today. They had some experience at the task. In 1985, there was a corn spill in 
the very same treacherous pass. And in 1983, tons of barley were spilled in the 
area. The latest spill has cost the railroad $3.9 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured we were going to have to deal with this for at least three summers," 
Christophersen said the other day as he surveyed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
This is summer No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
A sizzling 9,600-volt electrified fence has been put up around several acres 
down a steep embankment where the corn has sifted into the rocks and removal 
has been hardest. A few bears have broken in, but the fence seems to be 
holding. Corn plants that popped up from the seed have been pulled. The 
situation is stable, but not solved. 
</P>
<P>
The sickly, sweet smell of rotting corn fills the air, and fresh mounds of scat 
and diggings show that the grizzlies of northern Montana still find corn where 
the cleanup crews cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Three bears have been killed by passing trains -- two last summer and one so 
far this summer. The hazard will remain for years. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife biologists figure that even when the last kernel of corn is hauled off 
or rotted away, bears will remember and visit the scene each spring just to 
double check. This will likely go on for as long as they live, which for 
grizzlies is about 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
That means a cub that visited the site in 1990 will be dropping by in 2001 -- 
perhaps telling its disbelieving offspring the legend about that year when the 
great steel cars gave up mountains of corn, about that spring when the corn was 
deeper than the snow.

France confirmed Sunday that 27 French nationals were being held somewhere in 
Iraq, after the wife of one hostage accused Paris of keeping their detention 
secret for three days. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that the French citizens had been taken 
away, soon after the unidentified Frenchwoman appealed on France's TF1 
television channel for their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said the hostages included her husband and a 4-year-old girl 
traveling without her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi authorities informed us officially on Saturday, Aug. 18, of their 
intention to implement the measures they announced recently concerning 
foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the government learned of the French group's removal.

IRAN AND IRAQ AGREE TO EXCHANGE 8,000 PRISONERS DAILY

Iran and Iraq have agreed to increase the number of prisoners of war being 
released under their Persian Gulf War peace initiative from 1,000 on each side 
each day to 8,000, the Iranian news agency IRNA said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is insisting on 
interviewing each prisoner to make certain that he wants to return home, said 
in Geneva that it is sending more staff to Iran and Iraq to allow the prisoner 
exchange to speed up. 
</P>
<P>
But it declined to estimate how many prisoners a day it would now be able to 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries, impatient to see their people free after eight years of 
devastating war and two years of inconclusive diplomacy, urged the Red Cross on 
Saturday to send more staff. The exchange started Friday and so far 3,000 
Iranians and 2,000 Iraqis have been freed. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross has registered 50,000 Iranian prisoners of war and 20,000 Iraqis, 
but it estimates that there could be up to 15,000 more Iranian prisoners and 
20,000 more Iraqis.

Muslim fundamentalists trampled and burned American, British and Israeli flags 
at a rally in Jordan on Sunday to show anger at Western military action in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh America, assemble your troops, tomorrow the soldiers of truth will crush 
you," chanted a mainly Palestinian crowd of 3,000 in the industrial town of 
Ruseifa, just outside Amman. 
</P>
<P>
Youths masked with checkered head cloths doused the flags with gasoline and set 
them on fire. The crowd surged forward, ripping at the blazing fragments of 
cloth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of rallies and protests in Jordan, where 
anti-Western feelings have exploded since U.S.-led forces arrived in Saudi 
Arabia to defend it against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, which organized the Ruseifa rally, has not 
traditionally supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who has crushed 
militant Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Saddam has changed. We hope he is a good Muslim now," said Omar Obeid, a 
Brotherhood supporter in the crowd.

TROOPS KILLED JORDANIAN SOLDIER IN WEST BANK CLASH, ISRAEL SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Israeli army reported that its troops killed one Jordanian soldier and 
wounded a second Sunday in a clash in the occupied West Bank. No Israelis were 
hurt, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish occurred in the Jordan River Valley near the Damia Bridge (also 
called the Adam Bridge), about 17 miles north of Jericho and less than a mile 
inside Israeli-occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
The army said that an Israeli patrol noticed footmarks in an unpaved military 
road that runs along the Jordanian border and sighted two men in Jordanian army 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
The men were ordered to halt, but instead they opened fire on the patrol, the 
army said. The Israeli patrol returned the fire, killing one man and lightly 
wounding the other, who was taken into custody and is being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Itzak Mordechai, chief of the Central Command, arrived at the scene 
soon after the incident and commended the unit for its action. 
</P>
<P>
The army said that there have been two other infiltration attempts from Jordan 
this year and three incidents involving shots fired at Israeli soldiers from 
across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces weekly publication, Bamahane, quoted an 
unidentified intelligence source as saying that current events in the Persian 
Gulf are leading toward "an inevitable military clash." 
</P>
<P>
The publication also asserted that Israeli intelligence had alerted the United 
States beforehand to the likelihood of an Iraqi attack on Kuwait but that the 
Americans "remained complacent."

I.A. LEWIS, 68; DIRECTOR OF THE L.A. TIMES POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I. A. (Bud) Lewis, director of the Los Angeles Times Poll since its inception 
in 1979 and prior to that a respected pollster for CBS and NBC who was credited 
with conducting the first canvass of voters as they left their polling places, 
died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was 68 and had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this month at Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the relatively new art of polling after writing for Dave Garroway on 
the original "Today" show. He delighted in telling colleagues how each day he 
would try to create accompanying dialogue for whatever antics had been sketched 
out for J. Fred Muggs, the chimpanzee Garroway used on the daytime talk and 
information show. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1956-57, a few years after he had returned from Germany, where he 
had been a civilian employee of the Armed Forces Network working as a news 
writer and bureau chief. 
</P>
<P>
He then worked for United Press International and for Armed Forces Radio before 
joining the Garroway unit at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, born Irwin Albert Lewis, next joined the NBC election unit and became 
its director of polling in 1966 and director of elections in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Jordan, former director of the NBC election unit, said Lewis -- as 
director of polling -- was the first to station his workers outside precincts 
asking voters how they had marked their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
That was in the off-presidential year elections of 1966 and the samplings were 
taken in U.S. Senate races in a few selected states. The results provided an 
early, accurate edge in predicting the outcome of races. Exit polls since have 
become a staple of the industry, sometimes angering candidates who believe that 
West Coast voters may stay at home when they believe elections have already 
been decided by their counterparts in earlier time zones. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Lewis joined CBS News as director of polling for the CBS News/New York 
Times Poll, leaving for the Roper (polling) Organization the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later he came to this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Princeton University and a veteran of Air Force Intelligence 
service in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II, Lewis is survived 
by his wife, Allison, and four daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are pending at Forest Lawn Glendale.

Two of the 18 Cubans who were sheltering at the Spanish Embassy in Havana gave 
themselves up to the authorities Saturday night, the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said that Ricardo Figueroa Laredo was taken to a hospital 
suffering from a stomach illness, while Felipe Nerey Fonseca was returned to 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
The two, who had managed to break into the embassy early last July 21 despite a 
heavy police guard, left voluntarily and without conditions, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba has refused to allow any of the embassy refugees to leave the country but 
has promised they will not be punished if they give themselves up voluntarily.

INTO THE NIGHT: A LOT OF VOLUME AT ACLU BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Thursday night's premiere of "Pump Up the Volume," a benefit for the 
American Civil Liberties Union's Musical Majority. (Despite the allusion to 
Jerry Falwell, the M.M. supports free expression within the record industry). 
An after-party at the Hollywood Boulevard club Spice was hosted by New Line 
Cinema and MCA Records, which are putting out the movie and the soundtrack 
respectively. Each corporation even had its own eponymous ice sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Stars Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis and Lala, along with 
writer/director Allan Moyle, producers Rupert Harvey and Sandy Stern, and 
guests C. Thomas Howell, Richard Grieco (with his sisters), Lou Diamond 
Phillips, Polly Bergen and the ever-nightlife-lovin' Drew Barrymore. There were 
also several thousand publicists representing everyone and every group 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Ponytails and earrings -- for the guys, of course. Most of the 
women were clad in garments cut down to there and up to here. Lots of big hair 
for both genders. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Shrimp, lox, salads, fondue and strawberries so obscenely large, so 
simply red that they looked like David Lynch props or as if they'd been 
cultivated at Chernobyl. Slater, who will soon be 21, received a birthday cake 
with an icing picture of a St. Bernard carrying a keg. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: Performances by Liquid Jesus and the Cowboy Junkies. Dancing to 
taped music. Watching in fascinated horror as guests used their heels to put 
out cigarettes in the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Decor: Posters for the picture urged, "Give an Attitude" -- as if L.A.'s 
club-goers need any encouragement. In addition, the walls were painted with 
faux-subway graffiti, including the mysterious injunction, "Everybody Do the 
(expletive)." (If that's a new dance, we don't want to see it.) 
</P>
<P>
Favors: "Volume" buttons and soundtrack cassettes, plus -- courtesy of the ACLU 
-- a copy of the Bill of Rights and a bilingual, wallet-sized pamphlet about 
what to do if you're arrested. (FYI: You get two phone calls, not just one like 
in "Dragnet," and one of them can be to your "bail bondsperson.") 
</P>
<P>
Noted: The party had a designated "celebrity door," through which those who 
were more famous-than-thou were given ingress to meet the press and press the 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: The flick is about a teen-ager who challenges rights of free speech 
with his own pirate radio station. Writer/director Moyle says he began working 
on the story long before the 2 Live Crew and record-labeling controversies. 
"The FCC is just a pernicious, toxic government agency," he said. "It's a shame 
we have it in such a cool country with such a cool Constitution." (Speaking of 
cool, Christian Slater kept muttering an oft-repeated mantra in the crowded VIP 
area: "It's hot in here.")

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: PROSTATE PROBLEMS

<P>
Question: If someone has an enlarged prostate, won't there come a time when he 
will have to have an operation? And if that's the case, wouldn't it be better 
for that person to have the operation and get it over with, rather than 
waiting? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Surgery for an enlarged prostate may not be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The results of one study showed that of more than 100 men who had symptoms of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia, only 10 had opted for surgery during the 
following five years. Moreover, of those men who did not have an operation 
during this period, most felt their symptoms improved. 
</P>
<P>
Q: From talking with other mothers, I've become convinced that most ear 
infections in children happen during the winter months. Is there any logical 
reason for this? Since the ears are exposed all year-round, what difference 
does the time of year make in regard to the possibility of an ear infection? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ear infections in children can and do occur throughout the year; however, 
children tend to have more colds and upper respiratory infections during the 
winter. According to Dr. Richard Layton, an expert on pediatric allergy, when 
children have more colds, the possibility of ear infection increases. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184, 
Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. He cannot give personal replies but will answer as 
many questions as possible in his column.

LOOKING AT TINSELTOWN FROM A NEW ZEALAND POINT OF VIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SISTER HOLLYWOOD BY C.K. STEAD ST. MARTINS PRESS $15.95, 224 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best thing about watching movies -- even bad ones -- is that they catapult 
us immediately into another world. This is not a new idea, but it is always 
fascinating: Elmer Rice wrote about it in the 1930s, MacDonald Harris in the 
'80s, and many writers took their turns in between. Beyond the lure of the 
movies lies the lure of Hollywood itself -- again, not a new idea; again, 
always fascinating. Steve Fisher and Horace McCoy wrote about Americans seduced 
by the idea of Hollywood and then dashed upon the rocks of its unforgiving 
reality, and so did Nathanael West and many, many more. 
</P>
<P>
But this novel, "Sister Hollywood," looks at the seduction from another point 
of view: literally another place. Young Bill Harper grows up in Auckland, New 
Zealand. He has three sisters -- Edie, Ellie and Cassie. His dad is active in 
union politics. His grandma is an avid fan of movie magazines. And his mother 
-- partly because we're talking about the 1940s here -- is depressed. The kids 
give her a hard time, merely by their existence; and her husband every once in 
awhile bashes her up against the wall. They don't have the world's greatest 
relationship. Not terrible, not terrible, but the kind of home where the 
children might be wakened in the middle of the night, and dad is bashing mum, 
and she's screaming to beat the band. 
</P>
<P>
Any child would want to get away, that goes without saying. Mentally and 
emotionally, all the Harpers escape when they go out at night to the movies, 
but one day, Edie, the oldest, really does escape. No one in the family talks 
about it: It's one of those family secrets that is both "known" and "not 
known." Bill's mother gets worse; hard times come to his dad, and Bill himself 
takes up another, very well known form of escape. He buries himself in books, 
goes abroad to take a degree, returns, becomes a scholar, marries, "escapes" 
from his marginally squalid origins. 
</P>
<P>
But what of Edie? One night, at the movies, the whole family sees Edie in a 
film. They're sure of it. She plays a secretary and recites one line. But can 
it really be Edie? No one talks about it, but everyone knows it's true. 
</P>
<P>
The family's story is intercut with the story of Arlene and Rocky Tamworth, 
which spins out in a Hollywood location. Rocky hopes to become another Errol 
Flynn. But Rocky's Australian accent is too rough. And his own personality is 
too vulnerable. He's bluff, hearty and handsome, but Hollywood scares him to 
death. Rocky gets as far as being a crewman for Humphrey Bogart on his yacht, 
the Santana. Rocky goes to parties at Charles Laughton's house on the brink of 
the Pacific Palisades. Through him, and his wife, Arlene, the reader is 
reintroduced to Salka and Berthold Viertel (of Christopher Isherwood's "Prater 
Violet" fame), and to "Bert" Brecht, who cooperated with the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, and then flew out of the country the very next day. 
</P>
<P>
That wife, Arlene? It's Edie, of course. Not a starlet at all, but an 
increasingly successful Hollywood writer. Her husband, culturally orphaned, 
drinks himself into oblivion. Arlene/Edie falls in love with a Jewish 
producer/director. She realizes that her lover will never leave his wife 
because she, Arlene, is not only from New Zealand, but genteel. 
</P>
<P>
So, Edie has escaped. But she's orphaned, just as much as her husband. Bill 
Harper has escaped, in another way, but his way has its drawbacks as well. This 
is a very interesting book. But I would like to suggest to the author that he 
might want to check out the date that the San Diego Freeway came into 
existence. And I wonder where the place is on that freeway where you can see 
both the San Fernando Valley and the sea. And, finally I must suggest that the 
American expression is: "You take the cake," not, "You take the biscuit!" These 
are little things, like the date and time of Charles Laughton's party, that 
make the compulsive reader nervous.

KID FROST: POLITICAL RAP FOR CHICANO SOLIDARITY; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: HIS HIT 'LA RAZA' IS THE FIRST POPULAR EAST L.A. ANTHEM IN YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be incendiary; hot East L.A. rapper Kid Frost spitting out 
angry, Chicano political rap in his first headlining show, but it seemed more 
like date night in Reseda at the Country Club on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Frost is being touted as the Mexican-American answer to gangster rap, reporting 
the real scoop from the vicious Eastside streets. His image is kind of hard 
core too, and on stage he surrounded himself with a bunch of ominous guys in 
black caps, slim mustaches and dark shades, who glowered at the audience the 
whole show. Still, his hit "La Raza" is the first popular East L.A. anthem in 
years, and he seems more a spokesman for Chicano solidarity than a merry thug. 
</P>
<P>
Kid Frost is a chunky guy with slicked-back hair, a reindeer-print poncho over 
his T-shirt and chinos. A fat, gold rope around his neck supported a red, white 
and green pendant in the shape of Mexico, in place of the Afrika medallions 
worn by black unity rappers. He asked "How many people in the house speak 
Spanish?" and the crowd exploded in cheers. He said "This is for La Raza," the 
race, and they exploded again. He's got the Mexican-American equivalent of 
"Black and Proud" down cold. 
</P>
<P>
Frost has a truly idiomatic Chicano rap sound, underpinned with slightly 
Latinate beats -- maybe the cha-cha settings on the drum machine that 
generations of black rappers had ignored -- and overlaid with the kind of 
tough, bouncy sax lines associated with the East L.A./Tex-Mex rock of the '60s. 
His rapping style is light but fluent -- something like a Young M.C. with an 
edge -- and his articulation is clear. 
</P>
<P>
After half a dozen songs, Frost said good night, left the stage and waited for 
the tumultuous applause that would call for an encore. Finally, Frost came out 
-- a manhole-cover-size Aztec calendar slung around his neck -- and rapped 
another number anyway.

You tend to think of Sonic Youth more as a force of nature than just a band. 
The New York noisemeisters' music has become the defining standard for a whole 
wing of underground rock, where they're something like patron saints -- young 
bands name themselves after Sonic Youth records. 
</P>
<P>
A product of the alchemy between rock 'n' roll's aggression/release and the art 
world's heavy irony, their music expresses social decay and psychological 
breakdown with harrowing immediacy. Even the most committed disciple of dread 
might find Sonic Youth a little daunting. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hollywood Palladium on Friday, Sonic Youth canned the mystique and just 
played like a rock 'n' roll band. Lee Ranaldo might have jammed a screwdriver 
under his guitar strings on some songs, but the set was always hard-driving and 
forward moving, with Steve Shelley whaling away at the drums as if he were 
pushing the Ramones. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't quite as friendly as New Kids on the Block, but there was no 
studied aloofness: How remote could they be when members Thurston Moore and Kim 
Gordon were out in the audience checking out their friends STP, a New York girl 
punk band that opened the three-act show? 
</P>
<P>
The demystification coincides with Sonic Youth's surge from rock's hidden 
recesses into at least the twilight of the mainstream. The band's new album 
"Goo" is the first of seven to be on a major label, and headlining the 
4,400-capacity Palladium marked a huge and sudden increase in drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
Does selling tickets add up to selling out? "Goo" might be lighter in theme 
than earlier records, but there weren't any apparent concessions to 
commercialism during Sonic Youth's 80 minutes on stage Friday. The band hit 
some amazing grooves as it mounted its massive, burrowing sound, its roars and 
whoops and construction-site uproar inspiring stage-divers on the physical 
plane and art students on the cerebral. 
</P>
<P>
For a group of musicians who started as anarchists in the dark, they've 
acquired a few chops. Concentrating like a string quartet as they raced around 
atop skittering rhythms, they showed the touch and intricacy of a fusion band. 
The occasional strobe light and projected design conspired with the free-form 
jams to suggest a Fillmore flashback, and every now and then the players all 
hooked up and clattered off like a hellbound train. 
</P>
<P>
But they were also true to their roots: The set ended with a raw spasm of 
shrieking and guitar-smashing, all being shot for what Moore kept calling their 
"big video." They haven't lost their irony either.

LARRY CARLTON: LOOKING GOOD, SOUNDING GOOD;

JAZZ: THE GUITARIST-SINGER SEEMS FULLY RECOVERED FROM HIS GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

Larry Carlton is back and looking good. More than two years after he was shot 
in the neck by an unknown gunman, the guitarist shows no signs of the trauma he 
suffered in his voice and left arm. 
</P>
<P>
Any questions to the contrary were quickly dispatched at his Universal 
Amphitheatre concert Saturday night when Carlton opened his set with a 
whimsical, hard-swinging vocal on "Crazy Momma." It was, he explained, the 
first time he'd sung in public in three years, and his voice sounded firm and 
clear -- a marked change from the whispery utterances that were all he could 
manage in the first year after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton's program stuck with the things he does best: one or two big, blowzy 
blues to showcase his high-flying, tone-twisting guitar lines; funk-driven 
night-music pieces like "All in Good Time," and a few Carlton standards like 
"Smiles and Smiles to Go" and "Knock on Wood." All very predictable stuff, but 
all done with the drive and enthusiasm that are Carlton's best qualities. 
</P>
<P>
His one diversion from standard practices -- a rousing, up-tempo romp through 
Miles Davis' "So What" -- provided the evening's most unexpected musical 
sparks, both from Carlton and, especially, from the soloing of tenor 
saxophonist Hollis Gentry and keyboardist Terry Trotter. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Stanley Jordan, who opened the program with a trio, has firmly moved 
his music into the arena of rock/funk/fusion. Working with a setup that allows 
him to employ his unique, string-tapping technique on two guitars, one for each 
hand, Jordan has become a virtual one-man orchestra. Using the guitars as 
synthesizer controllers, he produced sounds ranging from massive orchestra 
textures to small jazz-group timbres. 
</P>
<P>
The results -- especially during Jordan's interaction with bassist Charnett 
Moffett -- were startling, if at times so technical as to lack a sense of 
emotional urgency. Jordan was far more moving when he encored with a 
passionately probing solo reading of "Over the Rainbow."

'SINGIN' IN THE RAIN' A WINNER AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The centerpiece of the American Cinematheque's "An Old-Fashioned Night at the 
Movies" Friday at the Hollywood Bowl was the presentation of MGM's classic 1952 
"Singin' in the Rain" to an audience of 18,000 people. It didn't start until 
after 9:30, for it was preceded by an hourlong program of shorts -- a newsreel, 
trailers, an amusing 1935 travelogue of Los Angeles and a delightful Tom and 
Jerry cartoon in which they're competing conductors -- at the Hollywood Bowl, 
no less. 
</P>
<P>
There was a welcome robust overture on the organ from Gaylord Carter, but there 
was also a dog act, a Rockette-type chorus line and Doc Severinsen and "The 
Tonight Show" Band. The 3 1/2-hour evening could have done without the live 
stuff, especially Severinsen and his group, who were not only off-form but on 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
"Singin' in the Rain," which stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor 
and Jean Hagen, needs no supporting acts but was well worth the wait. It has 
long been regarded as one of the greatest of American screen musicals, and a 
fresh viewing (on a pristine print prepared especially for the evening by 
Turner Entertainment) only confirms its stature. Its evergreen songs by Nacio 
Herb Brown and Arthur Freed (the film's producer) are set off by Betty Comden 
and Adolph Green's script, which is one of the wittiest ever written for a 
musical, a knowing, affectionate satire on Hollywood at the time of the chaotic 
talkie revolution in the late '20s. 
</P>
<P>
Comden and Green introduced Reynolds, its co-directors/choreographers Stanley 
Donen and Kelly, and from the audience, Kathleen Freeman, who played Hagen's 
squeaky-voiced silent star's pompous vocal coach. Also introduced from the 
audience were the film's hair stylist Sydney Guilaroff and make-up artist 
William Tuttle, two Hollywood legends in their own right. The American 
Cinematheque has an inspired idea with presenting classic films at the Bowl; it 
just needs to get on with the show faster.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHY THE NETWORKS NEED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT CHILDREN'S TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY CHARREN, Charren is president of Action for Children's Television 
(ACT). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The promise by commercial television networks to air eight hours of educational 
programming next April ("Networks Get a Lesson on the Education Crisis" by 
Steve Weinstein, Aug. 14) in reply to calls for help in dealing with the 
educational crisis in this country is obviously too little response from a TV 
system licensed by law to serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it is not too late to get stations to do more. The Children's 
Television Act of 1990, now working its way through Congress, requires stations 
to serve the educational needs of young viewers as a condition of license 
renewal and will open up a market for what's missing from TV offerings for the 
young. 
</P>
<P>
With television now feeding kids a steady diet of animated comic strips 
interrupted by exhortations to spend money, we are denying youngsters a chance 
to benefit from the most cost-effective educational system ever devised. Once 
envisioned as a magic carpet, TV today rarely carries the child audience 
farther than the toy store. Commercial television provides few excursions to 
lands across the sea or contacts with characters who are not zany cartoon 
ducks, dogs or dinosaurs. Morover, it gives youngsters only a smattering of 
information tailored to help them understand the major issues of our time. 
</P>
<P>
Children, especially those who lack the support of stable families and 
well-funded schools, need social institutions like TV to steer them in 
appropriate directions and help them make the most of available learning 
opportunities. Television can, on a daily basis, encourage virtually all of 
America's youngsters to read, including the 13 million who live in poverty, 
those who will pay illiteracy's greatest penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in our culture can match TV's extraordinary capacity to touch children 
and to influence how they think and behave. During the 25 hours per week that 
they watch it, TV should be sending out a loud and clear message that knowledge 
matters -- a lot. The message demands more than well-intentioned public-service 
announcements promoting the joy of reading, more than an occasional documentary 
spotlighting student skill deficits, more than the excuse that PBS stations and 
cable channels are "taking care of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Our need to know is more than just curiosity. In a democratic society, there is 
an obligation to inform and an equal obligation to be informed. Democracies 
depend on citizens who know enough about what's going on to choose leaders and 
chart policies that reflect their will. While children, too, have a need to 
know, their capacity to deal with some of the events that make news is limited 
by their cognitive and emotional development. 
</P>
<P>
Action for Children's Television (ACT) believes that along with fun and games 
the broadcast menu should include news and public-affairs shows geared to young 
people. Children's interests are poorly served when the most accessible 
news-gathering system in the world dispenses only news that's fit for adults. 
The news children see on TV does not help them understand what's happening 
(government), where it's happening (geography) and why it's happening 
(history). 
</P>
<P>
TV used to give children's literature a better break. In the 1970s, networks 
and stations frequently turned to books to entertain school-age viewers. Since 
then, deregulation has worked to distance children's programming from the 
printed page. 
</P>
<P>
TV and books are good for each other. TV builds readership for books, and books 
bring readers to the small screen to watch familiar scenes and characters come 
to life. Prize-winning author-illustrator Maurice Sendak noted that the TV 
version of his "Really Rosie" stories was seen by "more children than I could 
ever reach in 20 publishing lifetimes," an audience vastly multiplied since the 
release of the home-video cassette. Booksellers and librarians report they 
cannot keep in stock books that have made their television debuts. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who worry about children's TV think it can be improved by taking 
"bad" shows off the air. ACT disagrees on the grounds that censorship is never 
a proper remedy. Instead, we should make sure that the schedule gets filled 
with the kind of programs that are now missing. Were television programmers to 
look more often to bookshelves rather than toy shelves for inspiration, there 
might be less apprehension about TV's damaging effects. 
</P>
<P>
That's why America's parents will be cheering when President Bush signs the 
children's television bill. I bet Barbara will be clapping, too.

COUNTERPUNCH: CRITIC IS OUT OF TUNE WITH COUNTRY MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HINTON, Hinton is president of MCA/Nashville, Strait's record label. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' pop music critic begins his review of country music star George 
Strait's Aug. 12 Greek Theatre concert with the words "how embarrassing." How 
embarrassing, yes. Embarrassing for Robert Hilburn. 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn was "generous" enough to concede that "only about 10 country artists in 
history have had more No. 1 singles, and the standing ovation when Strait 
walked on stage at the sold-out Greek testified 
</P>
<P>
to his acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance? A better word would be adoration, as exemplified by Strait's recent 
hit single, "Love Without End, Amen," which tied Billboard's all-time record by 
holding the No. 1 spot on the singles charts for five consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In his review, Hilburn attributes George Strait's success to "today's 
undemanding market." Undemanding? Nothing like having a "pop music expert" 
patronizing country music fans and the music they love. 
</P>
<P>
Country music is healthier than ever, and it's not like the "Urban Cowboy" fad, 
which was fueled by the movie, and was something of a Hula-Hoop. This new 
explosion is based on great artists and great music. 
</P>
<P>
After admitting that "Strait did country music a service in the '80s by helping 
refocus attention on the music's classic values and away from the slick pop 
emphasis of the '70s," Hilburn announces that now "this rich American music 
form is in need of a creative jump-start." 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn should take some time and listen closely to the music of the new and 
established country artists on the scene today. Then, I'm confident he would 
hear all of the creativity that millions of country music fans are presently 
enjoying. To this end, I am sending a collection of CDs to him as recommended 
listening. Also, I am repeating my standing invitation of four years ago for 
him to attend the annual Harlin Howard "Birthday Bash" in Nashville on Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
What more can I say? When even one member of a choir is out of tune, the least 
one can do is suggest a tuning fork.

Prague Rock: The Rolling Stones, nearing the end of their 3-month-old Urban 
Jungle tour, rolled into Prague Saturday, drawing 100,000 to their first 
concert ever in Czechoslovakia. The crowd was all the more impressive because 
tickets sold for the equivalent of $10, about 8% of the average Czechoslovak's 
monthly wage. The Stones are donating all proceeds from the concert to a 
charity headed by the wife of Czechoslovakia's playwright-president, Vaclav 
Havel. BETH KLEID

LINES DRAWN IN 'MISS SAIGON' DISPUTE

<TEXT>

Hopefully, Charlton Heston's comments in Counterpunch (Aug. 13) were a failed 
attempt at prose and not the "obscene racist drivel" he accuses Actors' Equity 
of in its attempt to reconcile the "Miss Saigon" affair. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "Thousands of years ago, when blacks roved innocent in the African 
rain forests and Jews reigned remote in their desert redoubts, actors were 
wandering around Europe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago and presumably today Heston has us divided and categorized 
incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
According to him, there were blacks, Jews and then there were actors. 
</P>
<P>
Heston paints a clear picture of what we are all up against and the underlying 
reasons the "Miss Saigon" controversy has erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Mr. Heston, blacks are not a minority in the world. Nor did 
actors spring to their feet full formed on the streets of Europe. All actors 
have their roots in those tribal societies you mock in your opening statement.

It seems that in this latest affront to the Asian-American community (the 
attitude of "Miss Saigon's" producer), we are again ignoring the sexism 
inherent in the casting. 
</P>
<P>
From Charlie Chan to Kurosawa's upcoming film (which is one import from Japan 
we ought to ban), whenever the leading male role is an Asian character, time 
and time again it is played by a white actor while Asian females have 
opportunities to play not only leading roles as Asian characters, as in "Miss 
Saigon," but in mainstream parts (witness Joan Chen in television's "Twin 
Peaks"). 
</P>
<P>
Is this the same mentality that ensures that no Asian male can work as a news 
anchor in this town? 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that the feminists are keeping a tally on that score.

According to the World Book Encyclopedia, empires flourished in Ghana, Mali and 
Songhai during the Middle Ages, and civilizations had developed on the African 
continent as early as 5,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
African Americans are weary of the "jungle bunny" stereotype perpetuated by 
statements such as Heston's. As a musician, I empathize with his frustration 
with "union politics"; but as an African American, I take offense at the 
carelessness of his remarks.

'JOHN HAMMOND' TONIGHT ON KCET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, the legendary talent scout John Hammond went to Chicago to take 
part in a public television special staged in his honor. He was surrounded by 
many of the artists in whose careers he had played a seminal role; he talked 
with them and about them. 
</P>
<P>
Because that program, which has been rerun several times, was a unique tribute 
overflowing with live talent, it is difficult to understand the raison d'etre 
for "John Hammond: From Bessie Smith to Bruce Springsteen," to be seen tonight 
at 10:15 on KCET Channel 28 as part of the "American Masters" series. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier show was 90 minutes long; the new one is half an hour shorter. 
Whereas giants such as Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson, George Benson and Bob Dylan 
performed entire songs, live and in person, in Hammond's presence, this 
posthumous show (he died in 1987) finds the artists often in truncated early 
film clips; typically, Billie Holiday begins to sing one number and after eight 
bars the emcee, Ossie Davis, interrupts with a voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond is seen in color footage apparently shot not long before his death, and 
in snippets from a black-and-white interview in 1958 with the very unhip 
Gilbert Seldes. Comments about Hammond's role as a radical reformer and 
integrationist visionary are offered by Nat Hentoff, Milt Hinton, George Wein 
and others. Peter Seeger talks for a minute about the blacklisting days. Count 
Basie and Aretha Franklin are shown in short black-and-white segments. The 
cliche clips so familiar in jazz documentaries -- shots of jitterbugs, Harlem 
street scenes -- are shown yet again. 
</P>
<P>
There is valuable music and a measure of historic information here, but much of 
it smacks of deja vu. (How many more times are we going to see that one and 
only Bessie Smith film?) Those who did not see the earlier program may well 
find this sequel fascinating, though its better passages might well have been 
telescoped into the form of an addendum to the original.LEONARD FEATHER

TNT'S 'LAST ELEPHANT' HAS WRENCHING EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ray Loynd 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivory ornaments are slaughtered elephants. That's the theme -- and the 
wrenching visual impact -- of the strongly cast fictional film, "The Last 
Elephant" (TNT cable today at 5 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., with encore 
broadcasts Tuesday and next weekend). 
</P>
<P>
Shot in Nairobi and the wildlife bush country of Kenya, with Joseph Sargent 
directing a cast featuring John Lithgow, Isabella Rossellini and James Earl 
Jones, the production is the National Audubon Society's first effort to expand 
its environmental message beyond the documentary format. 
</P>
<P>
As an entertainment, with murderous poachers, corrupt ivory traffickers and a 
cynical, alcoholic adventure novelist (Lithgow) who finds mystery and purpose 
in Africa, "The Last Elephant" is a radical departure for Audubon Society 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
And a smart leap: You won't watch the staged but realistic massacre of a herd 
of elephants by ax-wielding, AK-47-bearing poachers from neighboring Somalia 
and Burundi and easily slip on ivory jewelry or feel the same way about the 
ivories on a piano. 
</P>
<P>
The movie doesn't pound you with facts, but there's an urgency here: bloody 
mutilation has cut the African elephant population in half in the last decade 
and in Kenya the number of elephants has plummeted from 70,000 to 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Richard Guttman and Bill Bozzone's script, from a story by Bradley T. 
Winter, the dialogue is brushed with telling images. "If man allows the beast 
to die, man's spirit will die of loneliness" becomes an unusually poignant line 
because it's translated from Swahili and uttered by an aging Masai tribal chief 
(not an actor). 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the writers deftly dramatize thematic points. Jones, playing a 
Nairobi police inspector, has such a great voice that he can, of course, make 
any line of dialogue tremble. Gazing at an elephant family of sisters, 
grandmothers, babies, he asks, "When will they learn to distrust us?" 
Rossellini's field researcher remarks more bluntly, "Elephants are cursed 
fugitives in their own territory." 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting the story's conventional, action-filled, romance-filled ending, the 
film's import is that it recalls arguably the greatest narrative prose ever 
written about the elephant (and collapsing colonial empires): George Orwell's 
unforgettable autobiographical essay (from his Burmese days), "Shooting the 
Elephant."Ray Loynd

BOOKS: CHARLES JOHNSON'S LATEST NOVEL, 'MIDDLE PASSAGE' IS A SEA TALE THAT ALSO 
RELATES A SLAVE REBELLION. ONCE AGAIN, THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED AUTHOR DEFIES 
CATEGORIZATION OF HIS WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, critics were describing "Faith and the Good Thing," Charles 
Johnson's book about a young black woman's quest for the meaning of life, as 
"brilliant" and "ebullient," the sort of first novel with which to anchor a 
major career. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, his second novel, "Oxherding Tale," traveled forlornly from 
publisher to publisher, like a flagless ship searching for a port, before 
diminutive Indiana University Press finally accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"My agent said selling that book was the major triumph of her career," says 
Johnson, 42, an impeccably polite man, who took 10 minutes to answer a 
stranger's question about writing workshops, while other fans at a recent Los 
Angeles book-signing affair fidgeted restlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was in town to talk about his latest book, "Middle Passage," an offbeat 
sea tale about a 19th-Century slave ship rebellion, and about some of the 
extra-literary stereotyping he has met with in his career as a novelist. When 
he's not writing, he teaches creative writing at the University of Washington 
and he lives in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Still far from being a household name despite three novels, a book of short 
stories, a book of literary criticism and 16 years of mostly raves, Johnson has 
garnered a lot of respect. He has established himself as a prime experimenter 
("If there's a rule in creative writing, I have to look at it real carefully," 
he says) and a wordsmith, the kind of writer who might sketch a bumbling Karl 
Marx into a story or create a swamp crone who spouts philosophy as if she were 
a Yale doctoral candidate. 
</P>
<P>
He's "part of the wave of the future . . . one of a few who are going to the 
head of the class," says critic Stanley Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't complaining about the indifference with which publishers met his 
second novel, just making a point about the powerful undertow that any black 
literary experimenter must swim against. "The publishers wanted a different 
kind of book from me," says the writer, an unobtrusive man behind thick glasses 
and a dark suit, like an extra in a crowd scene. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, things changed for all American writers in the early 1980s, he says. 
"There was a slump in the publishing industry," recalls Johnson. "Suddenly, the 
kinds of books that were projected to sell less than 10,000 copies weren't very 
popular. Publishers were going after the bestsellers." Despite good reviews, 
"Oxherding Tale," an updated slave narrative with Zen allusions, wasn't the 
kind of book that you'd expect to climb the charts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Illinois-born novelist had to face another big obstacle -- the notion 
that the African-American community somehow serves up its writers one at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"First it was Richard Wright, then James Baldwin, right?" says Johnson, a 
longtime teacher who likes to add a little interrogatory fillip to the things 
he says, as if he's leading the listener, point by point, through an exegesis. 
"The mantle was about to be passed on to Amiri Baraka when he decided that he 
didn't want to have anything to do with the white world. There was a little 
valley then, and Toni Morrison came along." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is that there's such a unity of experience among black people that one 
writer is enough to interpret it, while others are supposed to fall in as the 
top dog's imitators. "It's one writer speaking for 12 million people," says 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson passionately rejects the notion. His work has never fit into the 
categories that have defined recent black literature -- like the 
"up-from-the-ghetto" novel -- and he believes strongly in the variability of 
the black experience in America. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude has always been since, God knows, the days of Frederick Douglass, 
that, instead of richness and diversity, we see one level of expression," 
Johnson says. "But that's changing, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Along with "the novel of black pathologies . . . rats, roaches and drugs," he 
says, publishers and reviewers are at last recognizing black writers as diverse 
as David Bradley ("The Chaneyville Incident"), Clarence Major ("Emergency 
Exit") and Al Young ("Snakes," "Sitting Pretty"). 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of stories could be written about black professionals, black people 
who are mayors of cities," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's latest novel tells of the voyage of the Republic, a 19th-Century 
slave ship. It's written from the perspective of a freed slave, the well-read 
thief and stowaway Rutherford Calhoun. There are hurricanes, mutiny and a 
rebellion by members of a mystical tribe -- who have been imprisoned in the 
hold along with a powerful African idol -- as the ship's Faustian captain, an 
American buccaneer named Ebenezer Falcon, leads the ship recklessly towards 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The writer uses the Republic's voyage along the slave route to explore the 
philosophical underpinnings of slavery and the nature of a larger republic, 
another variegated construction that requires a lot of cooperation to stay 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun ultimately concludes: "If this weird, upside-down caricature of a 
country called America, if this land of refugees and former indentured 
servants, religious heretics and half-breeds, whoresons and fugitives -- this 
caldron of mongrels from all points of the compass -- was all I could rightly 
call home, then aye: I was of it." 
</P>
<P>
There is some hair-raising description of a small ship in a storm ("And then it 
was full upon us: a sea hot with anger, running in ranges like the Andes or the 
Rockies . . . "), mostly based on research rather than on direct experience, 
Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Johnson ever came to taking a sea voyage was a ferry on Puget 
Sound. But he rejects the idea that, before you can be a novelist, you have to 
work as a merchant seaman, a lumberjack and a short-order cook to provide the 
raw material for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I do enough research on a book for a dissertation," he says. For "Middle 
Passage" "I read all the sea stories -- Apollonius of Rhodes, Homer, the Sinbad 
stories and, obviously, Melville, Conrad and London. I read all of the 
narratives of slaves who came over by the middle passage." 
</P>
<P>
Several reviewers have said that the book is in the tradition of Herman 
Melville, whom Johnson candidly acknowledges as one of his literary forebears 
-- not because "Middle Passage" is a sea tale but because it is, like all of 
Johnson's fiction, consciously philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"All the characters in 'Middle Passage,' in fact, sound as if they're double 
majors in classics and philosophy," said one generally laudatory review in The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
As the narrator alludes freely to Bishop Berkeley and Parmenides, Falcon, whom 
Johnson modeled on the ruthless and erudite 19th-Century explorer Sir Richard 
Burton, ranges wide on the subject of slavery, describing it as "the social 
correlate of a deeper ontic wound." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the State University of New York 
at Stonybrook, is unapologetic about his characters' philosophical 
inclinations. "I believe firmly in the philosophical novel," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Born the son of a night watchman in Evanston, Ill., Johnson grew up with the 
idea of becoming a cartoonist. He almost made it. By the time he was 17, he was 
selling cartoons to Ebony, Jet and the Chicago Tribune, and in 1970, he became 
the host for 52 episodes of a PBS series on cartooning called "Charlie's Pad." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson had an irrepressible literary bent that cartooning couldn't 
satisfy. He wrote six "unpublishable" novels, he says, before attending 
Southern Illinois University, where he came under the sway of novelist John 
Gardner. The author of "Grendel" and "Sunlight Dialogues" got his youthful 
protege to discard formulaic writing and to explore philosophical issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He instilled a spirit in students which suggested that, even though there were 
high-wire performances by previous writers that were really up there, you could 
do it too, if you were willing to work hard," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has taught at the University of Washington since 1976, pounding away 
tirelessly at egotistical tripe in some of his young charges. "I have a real 
problem with literature that's full of interpretive cliches," he says, using an 
analogy that reverts to his days as a draftsman. "When you paint the model's 
hand, are you looking at the unique hand in front of you or are you drawing 
what you've seen hundreds of times in other drawings of hands?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has studied the martial arts -- kung fu and karate -- since he was 19. 
He's the co-administrator of Twin Tigers School in Seattle, where he and other 
instructors seek to emphasize, aside from chops and kicks, "respect for the 
forms." 
</P>
<P>
But martial arts belt rankings are an American obsession that are really 
unimportant, he says. "The main purpose of a belt is to hold up your pants," 
Johnson laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Belt coloration originally came from hard work, he says. "The harder you 
worked, the dirtier the belt got, until one day it was brown and finally it 
turned black," Johnson says with a glint of amusement. "If you kept at it, the 
white threads started to show through again, which meant a return to 
innocence." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on spiritual, rather than material, improvement is something 
Johnson tries to instill in his writing students. "Ultimately, the book is more 
important than the author," he says. "As a writer, there are tremendous ego 
pressures on you." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, an "off-again-on-again" Buddhist, meditates daily. "It has been said 
in the (Zen) literature that every meditation is holding a funeral for the 
ego," he says. "That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Like a martial arts teacher or a Zen master, Johnson leads his writing students 
through a careful study of their predecessors. He demands that his students 
understand and work with traditional forms -- fables, allegories, sea tales, 
slave narratives. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get here except by standing on the shoulders of others," he says.

AFTER 44 TORTURED YEARS, A MOTHER FINDS HER STOLEN CHILD VIA 'UNSOLVED 
MYSTERIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been 44 years since Alma Sipple had seen the woman, and then only 
briefly, yet she could not forget her -- the no-nonsense brown hair, the 
rimless glasses, the air of authority. Everything about her said "authority" -- 
and that's why Sipple had handed over her infant daughter. This nice woman was 
going to take the child to a hospital for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Sipple never saw her baby again. 
</P>
<P>
All these years, she has lived with the pain of her loss, with her guilt, with 
a gnawing need to know if her daughter was alive. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Dec. 13, scanning the TV dial, Sipple happened on NBC's "Unsolved 
Mysteries," a program she wasn't in the habit of watching. She sat forward on 
her chair, transfixed, as Robert Stack told the story of the late Georgia Tann, 
an infamous Tennessee social worker who'd made a fortune running a black-market 
baby adoption ring in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple recognized Tann immediately -- that face, that air of authority. "When 
they showed her picture," she says, "I let out a scream. I said, 'That's the 
woman that took Irma!' My husband said I turned white. I felt like going 
through the television." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers searching for their birth parents, or parents looking for their 
children, were advised during the show to contact Tennessee's Right to Know, a 
volunteer agency that reunites families separated by adoption, in Memphis. On 
Jan. 3, Sipple wrote to the address. Seven months later, with the help of that 
group and Marilyn Miller, an independent search consultant in Harbor City, 
Calif., Sipple found her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In Tennessee, Denny Glad, president of Right to Know, located the adoption 
records, which gave the names of Irma's adoptive parents. It was a first step. 
But then she was stymied. The records did not indicate the state in which the 
parents lived. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, on July 27, Sipple contacted Miller. On Aug. 3, Miller called back 
with good news. She had the name and address of Sipple's daughter. She was able 
to tell her that she was a registered nurse, married and living in Cincinnati. 
But the phone number was unlisted. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Sipple sent a basket of daisies and carnations to her daughter, with 
a guardedly written message that read, "Please call regarding family matters." 
Irma -- now Sandra Kimbrell -- was puzzled; she knew no one in California. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell called the California number the next day. She didn't know it, of 
course, but she was calling a mobile home park in Carson where Alma Sipple and 
her husband, Steve, live. Returning home, the Sipples picked up the message on 
the answering machine. "I could feel my blood pressure shoot up," Alma Sipple 
says. 
</P>
<P>
So now she had a number -- but what was she going to say to this woman, a 
stranger whose life she was about to turn upside down? 
</P>
<P>
She was scared. Would she be rejected? 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Sandra?" she said. "You know you're adopted?" Yes, she knew. "Well, 
this is your birth mother . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter let out such a scream, Sipple says, that she had to hold the 
telephone at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
They talked for an hour. Sipple says, "She wanted to know what happened, how, 
what I looked like, how many brothers and sisters she had." 
</P>
<P>
She also wanted to know, "Mom, where did you get that accent?" (Sipple is a 
self-described Kentucky "hillbilly," who gives both Elvis Presley and Jesus 
Christ wall space in her mobile home). 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell reflects, "At first, it was more than I really could take in. It's one 
thing when you find your birth mother. It's something else when you hear the 
circumstances that go with it." 
</P>
<P>
This is the story she heard unfold over the next few days, Alma Sipple's story. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1946, Sipple, then in her early 20s, moved with her infant 
daughter to Memphis, where her 2-year-old son, Robert, a child of a previous 
marriage, was staying with friends. Sipple's boyfriend, Julius John Tallos -- 
"Johnny" -- had just shipped out to Panama. They planned to be married, by 
proxy, as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
They'd met in Biloxi, where Tallos was stationed with the Air Force and Sipple 
was working as a bartender. By the time Irma was born -- on Aug. 27, 1945 -- 
they'd been together about two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so crazy about each other, it didn't matter if we were married or 
not," she recalls. Besides, there had been two marriages that ended in divorce, 
the first when she was only 14 and had married to get away from her Kentucky 
home, where there were 17 children and a razor strop was the preferred form of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
In Memphis, Sipple and her two children settled into a an oil-heated one-room 
apartment, where she shared a pullout sofa with her toddler son and the baby 
girl -- a dimpled child with reddish-blonde hair -- slept nearby in her crib. 
</P>
<P>
About six weeks after they'd moved in, a woman from the Tennessee Children's 
Home Society, an organization with an impeccable reputation for finding homes 
for orphans, came to the apartment building, saying she was investigating an 
alleged child-abuse case involving a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, the woman returned in her big black limousine, this time 
striking up a conversation with Sipple, asking her questions about the 
whereabouts of the baby's father. Then the woman looked at Irma, who had a 
runny nose, and said, "Your baby's sick, isn't she? You should get her a 
checkup." Sipple explained that she had no money for a doctor, so the woman, 
who identified herself as Georgia Tann, generously offered to take the child to 
Memphis General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Sipple wonders at her own naivete. "How did I mess up so bad? I 
guess she knew the dumb ones." Still, she had been worried about her baby's 
health. And she'd assumed she would go with them to the hospital. So she had 
signed a piece of paper. When Tann told her it would be impossible for her to 
go along, Sipple remembers, "I had a weird feeling, but I thought, 'Well, 
you've gotta trust somebody.' " 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Sipple went to the children's ward at the hospital, where she 
found Irma "jumping up and down in her bed." But when she told a nurse she 
wanted to see her baby, the nurse said, "You don't have a baby in there. Those 
children belong to the Children's Home Society." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, Sipple's calls to Tann went unanswered. Finally, Sipple 
says, Tann called back. "She told me Irma had died." Pneumonia. "Of course, I 
went into hysterics." 
</P>
<P>
When Sipple said she wanted to make arrangements for the burial, she was 
rebuffed by Tann, who told her, "I took it on myself and had the state put her 
away." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Sipple says, "I guess I went crazy." She took Robert to Ohio to 
stay with her mother. And she returned to Memphis. "I wanted to find the grave. 
I was half out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, she says, "It still hurts when I think about it." 
</P>
<P>
She found no grave. Her calls to the Children's Home Society yielded only the 
information that "the case is closed." She was told that Tann "has nothing to 
say to you." 
</P>
<P>
With her son, Sipple returned to Kentucky. Her roots were there, and there she 
had two small daughters, the children of her first marriage, who were living 
with their father. She got a job at a uniform company in Cincinnati tried to 
put behind her the tragedy of Irma. 
</P>
<P>
The letters from the child's father in Panama were fewer and fewer. "He'd 
worshipped Irma," she says, and couldn't deal with the death. 
</P>
<P>
"That," she says, "and my going crazy. I drank, I admit it. I thought it would 
make it easy. All it did was keep me crying all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The last she knew, Tallos was living in Flint, Mich. She says, "I hope he does 
show up, if he's living. He loved her so much . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards, Sipple married James Smith, a steel mill worker, a union that 
lasted 12 years and produced three sons and a daughter. She never stopped 
thinking about Irma, but her husband did not encourage her to think those 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
After her divorce from Smith, she married Steve Sipple, a welder. They had a 
daughter and lived in Kentucky until 1969, when they moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sipple understood her need to trace Irma and, in the last few years, she 
had resumed her search. In 1982, she sent a query to the Bureau of Vital 
Statistics in Nashville. The answer came back: There was no death certificate 
for Irma Tallos. After that, she ran into brick walls. The district attorney in 
Memphis couldn't help. The Tennessee Department of Human Services couldn't 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Then, by chance, Sipple happened to tune into "Unsolved Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irma -- named Sandra by her parents -- was growing up in a 
comfortable home in Cincinnati, where she and her adoptive mother had gone to 
live after her parents divorced. At one time, Alma Sipple had lived only a few 
miles across the river in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
She was an only child with doting parents -- now deceased -- with whom she had 
a "wonderful" relationship even after the split. She always knew she was 
adopted but she was too content, she says, to search for her biological 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably was very spoiled," she says. "I was a very wanted child. They 
always told me because I was adopted I was special, I was chosen. I had a very, 
very comfortable upbringing. I don't think I could have asked for much more." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents were in their 30s when they adopted her, and were thrilled to have 
a child. "I went through the whole bit," she says, "the piano lessons, the 
dancing lessons. We traveled. They were very much for education, very 
supportive of a working woman." 
</P>
<P>
In short, she says, "it's been a good life." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of University of Cincinnati and an R.N. who is head operating room 
nurse at Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati, Sandra has been married for 24 years to 
Bill, a stockbroker, and has a daughter, Kara, 22, a teacher and a recent 
bride, and a son, Bill Jr., 20, who is in college. 
</P>
<P>
Home is a four-bedroom French country-style house on a golf course in an 
upper-middle-class planned community in Westchester, a suburb north of 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks about the events of the last few weeks and tries to absorb the fact 
that she, an only child married to an only child, suddenly has eight siblings 
-- Alma's four sons and three daughters and Steve Sipple's daughter from 
another marriage. "It's like, whoa! My kids always complained they never had 
aunts or cousins." 
</P>
<P>
She is also trying to absorb the "unbelievable" story of how she was taken from 
her birth mother. All she knew until now, she says, is that she had been born 
in Denver and adopted out of Memphis. She had never asked many questions of her 
adoptive parents -- "I really thought it would hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
When she thought about looking for her birth parents, it was mostly because of 
her interest in her medical history. Recently, she'd thought about it more 
often, realizing that her birth parents would be getting older. 
</P>
<P>
The truth has been hard to swallow, that she was a black market baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I was illegitimate," she says, but "whoa! This is bizarre." She 
admits it's been "hard for me to understand letting someone come in and take 
your child away, that's the hardest thing." She wonders how much she was sold 
for. 
</P>
<P>
She calls her birth mother "Juanita," her middle name, which is what other 
family members call her. There have been long phone calls, letters and 
videotapes. Now, the families are trying to figure out how to get together. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on what has happened, Kimbrell says of her new-found family, "The 
love they have poured out in this last week has been unbelievable. One of them 
said it was like having a new baby in the family. It's kind of neat to feel 
love from somebody who doesn't even know you." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, she says, has been "real supportive . . . he's here for me." Then 
she laughs and says, "He keeps asking, 'How many kids are there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Alma still calls her daughter "Irma," and is constantly correcting herself. 
Sandra says, "That's really hard to deal with, another name. I've been Sandra 
for almost 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
For mother and daughter -- both of whom have reddish hair and resemble one 
another physically -- it's been a process of getting-to-know-you. "We have very 
definitely lived two different lives," Sandra says. "There's some working 
through for both of us to do. I have had a very, very nice life and I had a set 
of parents." 
</P>
<P>
Each must figure out where the other fits in her life. "I don't think it's 
something that's not workable," Sandra says. "If nothing else, we can all come 
out of this feeling like we're friends. Where it goes from there, I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Alma Sipple is but one of thousands of victims of Georgia Tann and her black 
market baby scam. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Glad, president of Tennesee's Right to Know, says, "We have been 
overwhelmed" by callers who saw "Unsolved Mysteries." "We got over 600 calls," 
most from apparent victims of Tann. Sipple's case is one of about 50 that Right 
to Know has solved or is close to solving. 
</P>
<P>
Glad, who has researched the Tann case extensively, says she "continues to be 
amazed at the enormous volume of children" who were placed in adoptive homes by 
Tann, using the respected Tennessee Children's Home Society, of which she was 
Shelby County director, as cover. 
</P>
<P>
Some children, like Irma, were simply stolen. Others, usually older youngsters, 
were abducted and taken to Juvenile Court as the first step toward being placed 
for adoption. Other parents were coerced into giving up their children. The 
judge, Camille Kelley, apparently was on Tann's payroll, and parents' protests 
fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
All together, it is estimated, Tann illegally placed more than 5,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the wronged parents did go to the police, Glad says, but most were poor 
and not well-educated -- Tann's primary target group -- and frustrated in their 
efforts to fight the powerful and charismatic Tann. There were complaints and 
lawsuits filed. But, Glad says, all of these "would just be dismissed by these 
local judges. The political machine was so entrenched, and so powerful." 
</P>
<P>
She adds, "I understand why people find it incredible. It's taken me all these 
years to reconcile myself to the fact it really could have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Taylor, the attorney appointed by the Tennessee governor in the late 
1940s to investigate Tann and Kelley, estimated that Tann made well over a 
million dollars selling babies. Typically, the children were whisked out of 
state by dark and delivered to waiting adoptive parents out of state. The 
majority went to California and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Glad believes the adoptive parents were unaware of the chicanery. "For whatever 
reason," she says, "most of them had not been able to qualify to adopt in the 
state in which they lived. Primarily, age was the reason. Most were in their 
40s and 50s." Through word-of-mouth, they would learn that they could get a 
child out of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
And, she says, "they didn't raise too many questions." In California, the 
average cost to adopt one of Tann's babies was $750. 
</P>
<P>
Often, Denny Glad has wondered whether Tann had motives besides money. She 
says, "In most cases, (the victims) were poor people, or unwed mothers. Miss 
Tann thought that affluency meant good and I believe that's how she justified 
what she was doing. She was taking children who never would have had a chance 
and placing them in homes where they were going to get good educations and all 
the material things. 
</P>
<P>
"She just thought that she knew better than God." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tann died of cancer in 1950, three days before the state investigators 
delivered their damning report. After the state's investigation, Judge Kelly 
was permitted to resign; she died in 1954. The Children's Home Society was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple's little boy, Robert Anderson, is now 46 and living in Northern 
California. Finding Irma was a real thrill. For years after his baby sister 
disappeared, he thought he'd killed her, having just bopped her in the head 
with his toy Jeep in a sibling dispute. 
</P>
<P>
And Alma Sipple? For the first time in 44 years, she says, "I feel whole. Ever 
since Irma was taken from me, I felt something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
She adds, "The Bible says you're not supposed to hate anybody, but I'll tell 
you, if that woman was still living . . . all those people she did this to, all 
the suffering she caused for money. And she couldn't take a dime of it with 
her."

GOLDEN AGE FOR NISEIS CELEBRATED IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: WEEKLONG CEREMONIES MARK 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FESTIVAL IN L.A. THE 
EVENTS PASS ON JAPANESE CULTURE TO CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS AND OTHERS.

Three 16th-Century warlords stepped out of the pages of Japanese history and 
rode horseback through the streets of Little Tokyo on Sunday afternoon as the 
Nisei Week parade marked the 50th time the weeklong festival of cultural events 
has come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On a float and on foot, authentically costumed ladies of the court and marching 
samurai followed the Japanese folk heroes -- all part of a company of Japanese 
actors who had come to join the Japanese-American community in Southern 
California as it celebrates its heritage with traditional Japanese dancing, 
theater, art, music and food. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Nisei Week Japanese Festival. The 
event was organized to pass Japanese culture down to children of Japanese 
immigrants, hence the word "Nisei," or second-generation Japanese-American. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, the largest Japanese-American cultural event in the United 
States, also served to gather a Japanese community that is spread throughout 
Southern California, and to stimulate business in Little Tokyo. It did a good 
job of both: 
</P>
<P>
Masaru Ota, 72, began attending the parade when he lived in a downtown boarding 
house in 1939. "It's getting better," he said. He likes the fact that more 
non-Japanese seem to be coming to Nisei Week events. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people took part in Sunday's parade. The 150 parade entries 
included large dance troupes, forming seas of gracefully moving women, some of 
them in pink and blue kimonos and swirling fans of orange and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Among the spectators -- whose numbers police estimated at 10,000 -- was 
Imperial Princess Sayako, 21, who watched from the fourth-floor balcony of a 
bank building. The only daughter of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko is on 
her first U.S. visit at the invitation of Nisei Week officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ota had brought his relatives from Japan, including his sister, Harumi Omai, 
69, a councilwoman from Hiroshima. Omai was born in Baldwin Park but returned 
to Japan when she was young. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has changed so much," she said in Japanese as Ota interpreted. "The 
old Niseis had such a hard time. I can see now that they have achieved success. 
I'm very impressed by the parade. You don't even see this many dancers in 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the music was classical Japanese and some was straight out of American 
jukeboxes. 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of the Oki family were there to hear it. Seventeen-month-old 
Aimee Oki was so taken by the beat of the rock 'n' roll classic "Louie Louie," 
played by the Banning High School Band, that she started rocking out in her 
baby stroller. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Rick Oki, a chimney sweep from Ventura County, said he came to the 
parade for his children's sake. His 3-year-old daughter has her own kimono and 
wants to dance in the parade someday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Mattucci, 59, brought his 7-year-old grandson to give him a glimpse into 
other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids these days don't even know where Sacramento is," said the former Navy man 
who was stationed off Japan for a time. "For me, I've been around. But for him, 
it shows that people have different habits than in his world. I try to get my 
grandchildren interested. Like I say, they're very narrow-minded." 
</P>
<P>
Nisei Week concludes next Sunday. During the week, throughout Little Tokyo, 
performers and artists will be presenting ceramic displays, the art of bonsai, 
arts and crafts, martial arts demonstrations, a tea ceremony and a children's 
performance of Kabuki theater. 
</P>
<P>
As Frances Hashimoto, Nisei Week chairwoman, said: "Nisei Week is a great way 
to promote Japanese culture, and I guess when it does that, it promotes 
Japanese-American relations."

HOLLYWOOD MAN KILLS 4 IN FAMILY, THEN HIMSELF 
</P>

A Hollywood man, reportedly distraught over domestic problems, stabbed his 
common-law wife to death, then shot and killed his three young children before 
turning the gun on himself, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers went to an apartment in the 1700 block of North Normandie Avenue at 
1:30 p.m. Sunday to check on Rodolfo Meinguer, Maria Ortiz and their three 
children after Ortiz's sister had been unable to contact the family for two 
days, Los Angeles Police Detective Russell Kuster said. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers forcibly entered the locked apartment where they discovered the 
entire family of five dead on the living room floor and in the bedroom," Kuster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that Meinguer, 40, a supermarket butcher, had 
apparently stabbed his 28-year-old common-law wife to death in the apartment's 
bedroom with a butcher knife, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
"He then went to the living room where he shot and killed the three children 
who were sleeping on the floor," Kuster said. "Later, he turned the gun on 
himself and committed suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the children as Joe, 3, Rosalyn, 6, and Rodolfo 
Meinguer, 8. They were shot with a large-caliber handgun, Kuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Reyes, the dead woman's brother-in-law, said Meinguer had called 
several times Friday insisting that he and Ortiz's sister visit the apartment 
that night for a family reunion. Reyes said he believes Meinguer wanted them to 
come by so that they would discover the dead bodies. Police say the family 
could have died as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there was evidence that Meinguer had been drinking heavily before 
the killings. He and Ortiz were Mexican immigrants who had been living in the 
United States for several years, Kuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuster said there was no record of any past domestic violence between the 
couple, although relatives told investigators the pair had been having problems 
recently with their relationship.

GROUP MAKES 'MIRACLES' IN COURT HAPPEN; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL SYSTEM: VOLUNTEERS GUIDE APPLICANTS FOR GUARDIANSHIP THROUGH A PAPERWORK 
MAZE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sandra Gregory was hunched over the counter in Room 258 in the Los Angeles 
County Courthouse shuffling a pile of papers as thick as a suburban phone book. 
</P>
<P>
The documents that she was supposed to fill out had titles such as "Order of 
Notice," "Notice of Hearing," "Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Act" and 
"Proof of Service." For days, these forms had confused her and slowed her 
efforts to, as she said, "Get my miracle from heaven." 
</P>
<P>
The "miracle" is a 6-year-old girl whom Gregory has had custody of since the 
child was a month old. The baby had been given away to a neighbor by her 
mother, who could not care for her. The neighbor had hired Gregory to baby-sit. 
</P>
<P>
"I just fell in love with her, so she gave her to me six years ago," recalled 
Gregory, of Los Angeles. "My own son was killed 20 years ago when he was a baby 
and I felt God had given me another child." 
</P>
<P>
But Gregory, like hundreds of others seeking legal guardianships, has found the 
court procedures confusing, intimidating and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The court's guardianship system has for several years been staggering under 
increased caseloads. In the last two years, the number of applications has 
doubled as more and more parents -- many of them drug-addicted and homeless -- 
are unable to care for their children, and relinquish them to family, friends 
or neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally bananas," court clerk Ozzie Cortes said. "Some take a day off 
from their jobs to do it. They'd come for their court appearance in tears, with 
crumpled court papers in hand, incorrectly filled out or not filled out at all. 
"They'd beg us to do it for them, and of course we couldn't right there in the 
courtroom. So we'd tell them to get help and come back." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no help for those who could not afford to hire an attorney. So 
they would end up going back to court again and again, clogging the system with 
delayed court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin gave a talk at a meeting of 
the Beverly Hills Bar Assn. about the plight of the guardianship applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by attorney Barbara Bailey, organized a volunteer program in 
which 25 attorneys and paralegals from across the county volunteer their time 
to help those seeking guardianships. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers do not give legal advice. Instead, they take turns assisting 
applicants every Tuesday and Thursday morning in the court's Probate 
Department. They help them fill out the paperwork and make sure they have all 
the necessary documents for their court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The founders believe that it is the first of its kind in California, and they 
have had requests from other court systems wanting to try a similar project. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the legal work, Goldin also provided some practical aids. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the applicants bring along the babies and children," she said, adding 
with a laugh: "We got tired of them changing diapers on the counter, so we 
installed changing tables in the second floor bathrooms for them." 
</P>
<P>
The typical guardianship applicants, Probate Commissioner Ann Stodden said, are 
grandparents or relatives who have had to take over the care of a child because 
the parents are on drugs, in jail, on the streets or have simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been an increase in the number of women who join the armed 
forces and must have guardianships for their children while they are in basic 
training, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a total of 443 guardianships were granted in the county, but in the 
first six months of this year the number of guardianships processed was 398. 
</P>
<P>
There are two types of guardianships available, Stodden explained, those of the 
"person" and those of an estate. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney volunteers can assist only those who want to take over the custody 
of children, by far the most common. Those seeking guardianship of a minor's 
estate must obtain bonds and hire attorneys to help them set up trusts for any 
money the child has inherited, usually insurance money and bank accounts of 
deceased parents. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes people keep children for years without guardianships, but discover 
that they need legal control of them when they go to enroll them in school, 
obtain medical care and receive welfare benefits for the child. 
</P>
<P>
The guardianship fees are $329, but the county waives them for those who have 
low incomes. As part of the guardianship process, the applicant must also 
undergo a criminal background check and an investigator visits the home. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain a guardianship of children under the age of 18, the applicant must 
serve papers informing the real parents that a guardianship request is taking 
place. Rarely do the parents -- whose whereabouts are often unknown -- contest 
such actions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
If they do contest them, the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Guardianships differ from dependency cases, which are legal proceedings in 
which children are made wards of the court, usually because their parents have 
been criminally negligent and abusive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, half a dozen people had taken numbers and were awaiting 
their turn with the volunteer attorneys in Probate Court. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Gregory had returned again on this day to finalize her legal work. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so excited, I can't wait," she said. "I can't wait for the judge to tell 
me my little girl is mine."

HOMEOWNERS' REVOLT IN DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS PROTEST HUGE PRICE CUTS ON NEW TRACT 
HOUSES, DEMAND REBATES FROM DEVELOPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Only a few months after moving into new homes in the Antelope Valley, Tom 
Schreiber and many others like him say they ought to be concentrating on 
tending yards, building patios and the other supposed joys of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they say, they are anguishing over how the developers who built their 
houses are now selling the same ones, sometimes next door, for as much as 
$50,000 less than what they paid. And that anguish is spurring Schreiber and 
others to demand some of their money back. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty bad. I feel like I've been wiped out. I'm back to square one, 
like I was back in college," said Schreiber, 36, an aerospace worker who put 
his life savings into a new $245,000 house, only to have the price cuts erase 
his equity. The same model now sells for $196,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although a downturn in the housing market exists throughout Southern 
California, housing industry officials say the high desert is the only place 
they know of where residents who bought at the market's peak are demanding that 
developers reimburse them the amount of recent price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, dozens of homeowners in at least four tracts in the Quartz 
Hill area, a relatively pricey community west of Lancaster, have asked for 
money back, to no avail. Angry homeowners have picketed the sales offices at 
two of those tracts, and some residents are threatening lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaufman and Broad Home Corp., one of the state's largest home builders, 
hoping to avoid such protests, gave at least nine buyers in their California 
Chateau project in Quartz Hill rebates worth $13,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The rebates were doled out to existing homeowners after the developer decided 
to try to entice new buyers with offers of valuable upgrade packages that gave 
them more for the money. Even those upgrades -- more elaborate landscaping, 
fancier tile, more fashionable window treatments -- failed to spur sales of the 
homes, costing up to $325,000. The developer ended up selling off lots with 
only foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Greene, president of the Antelope Valley Building Industry Assn., said 
that market swings affect developers as much as homeowners, and drastic price 
cuts are a move of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs us a great deal of money to carry homes," he said. "It has nothing to 
do with profit, but . . . survival." 
</P>
<P>
The rebate demands, picketing and sharp drops in builders' asking prices in 
some Antelope Valley areas are all signs that the new home market there, the 
largest and most affordable in the county, has been hit unusually hard by the 
state's broader downturn in housing. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts say that is the result of an unusual and unfortunate set of 
local events. 
</P>
<P>
Hefty increases in city development fees approved by the cities of Palmdale and 
Lancaster last fall caused developers to rush hundreds of new homes onto the 
market, just as the statewide slowdown was taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
That slump, along with already high home prices in the San Fernando Valley, 
left many residents unable to sell and trade up to more expensive homes in the 
high desert, cutting the demand for homes in the market's top rung. At the same 
time, several years of double-digit price increases made even lower-priced 
homes in the Antelope Valley less affordable for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the housing glut and the shortage of buyers led to frenzied 
competition among builders that caused them first to offer incentives and then 
to cut prices. That touched off a furor among those who paid much higher prices 
last fall. Some real estate experts also partly blamed builders for panicking. 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials said they know of nowhere else in the county where the 
housing slowdown has caused such turmoil. They said other fast-growing areas, 
such as the Santa Clarita Valley and Calabasas, seem to have fared better 
because fewer new homes are on the market and fewer developers compete for 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
While the Quartz Hill area has suffered the deepest price cuts, people who 
struggled to buy fast-moving homes in Lancaster and Palmdale last year are now 
finding new buyers enticed with offers of free cars, swimming pools, vacations, 
upgrades or financing packages. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate experts, the new home market in the Antelope Valley, 
which consists of about 150 separate projects, the most in the county, became a 
victim of its own size, success and, to some extent, bad timing. Some 
homeowners said that developers raised prices too high, too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two to three years of progressive great times. But when it fails, it 
fails fast," said Eric Brown, an Encino-based vice president with the Meyers 
Group, a real estate consulting firm. He said the Antelope Valley's new home 
market has been harder hit than any other in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the median price of homes in the Antelope Valley was about 
$153,000, compared to about $300,000 in the San Fernando Valley. New home sales 
in the high desert dropped from nearly 1,600 from March through May of last 
year to just under 600 for the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of unsold new homes in the high desert skyrocketed 
from just under 300 last May to more than 2,500 this May. At the current rate 
of sales, with no new homes built, that is a 55-week supply, according to the 
Meyers Group. 
</P>
<P>
Builders valleywide have had to lay off employees and executives, some as much 
as half of their work force, said Greene, a senior vice president with Pacifica 
Corp., a Westlake Village-based developer. Auctions of homes and even sales of 
partially built ones have been held. 
</P>
<P>
But developers get no sympathy from Schreiber, a former test pilot who works 
for Lockheed and lives in one of Pacifica's tracts, Steeple Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Housing industry officials and lenders have urged those in Schreiber's 
situation to wait for the market to recover. Banks and other lending 
institutions say California still has perhaps the nation's strongest real 
estate market, and they are not fearful of owners defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
But angry residents say they have been permanently damaged and will always be 
at a disadvantage, compared to neighbors who bought for substantially less. 
Some also complain that they cannot get equity loans, and some, such as 
Schreiber, whose job has been moved to Georgia, say they can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Schreiber's tract, demands for rebates in recent weeks have come 
at Griffin Homes' Quartz Hill project and Cambridge Development's Cambridge on 
the Hill tract, where residents have picketed, and Watt America's Highlands 
project.

The Ventura City Council will consider today granting $400,000 to the Ventura 
Visitor and Convention Bureau and $17,500 to the Ventura County Museum of Art 
for the 1990-91 fiscal year that began in June. 
</P>
<P>
Both grants were included in the current city budget and are expected to 
receive the council's support. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the city, the bureau will use the money to promote 
tourism with brochures, pamphlets, posters, periodicals and convention 
materials. It also would track visitor statistics, monitor legislation 
affecting local tourism and present the council with a marketing plan outlining 
the bureau's strategy for wooing tourism to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The museum grant would go toward acquisition, development and promotion of 
historical collections, artifacts and programs, said Assistant City Manager 
Lauraine D. Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the museum states that the city expects the museum 
eventually to become self-sufficient. "It is not intended that the museum will 
rely on the city for support," the document states. Ventura began funding the 
museum in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Brekke said the grants are similar to allocations that the bureau and the 
museum received last year. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

The Boys and Girls Club of Ventura and the Youth Connection of Camarillo are 
moving ahead with plans for expanding their facilities after winning grants of 
$75,000 and $750,000, respectively, from the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys and Girls Club provides care for disadvantaged children while offering 
recreation and enrichment activities for children ages 5 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Jane Goldschmidt said the money will be used to buy 
equipment and furnishings for a 15,000-square-foot expansion of its facility on 
Bristol Road, which will include a gymnasium and a computer learning center. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Youth Connection was formed to coordinate and develop the Casa 
Pacifica project, a crisis care center able to house 85 to 110 abandoned, 
neglected or abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Pamela Burke said the group's award will go toward financing 
about half of the center's administration facility on Esplanade Drive, which 
will include a toddler area, medical unit and nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said construction is slated to begin in June, 1991, and will take about a 
year to complete. SCOTT LAWRENCE

NEW OPERATION FOR DIABETES

<P>
An experimental transplant operation designed to free diabetics from insulin 
injections has produced the most promising results since the technique was 
developed, researchers reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure enabled five of nine patients to significantly reduce their need 
for daily insulin injections, including one 16-year-old Louisville, Ky., girl 
who has remained completely independent of injections for more than six months, 
the researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely excited," said Dr. Camillo Ricordi of the University of 
Pittsburgh, who published the results with his colleagues in the British 
medical journal Lancet. "It's opening up a whole new perspective on cellular 
transplants." 
</P>
<P>
The procedure involves removing so-called islet cells from the pancreas of a 
donor, then purifying them and injecting them into a patient. The cells, which 
are the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, then lodge in the liver and 
begin cranking out insulin. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure has shown promise for years in animal studies and some early 
attempts on humans. But the new study has produced the most favorable results 
to date, experts said.

<P>
STUDIO CITY: THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL CONDUCT A HEARING TODAY ON THE 
PROPOSAL TO HOUSE LOW-RISK PRISONERS ON WORK FURLOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retirement home in Studio City may be converted to a work furlough facility 
for low-risk prisoners under plans scheduled for a hearing today before the Los 
Angeles city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The program would allow drunk drivers, check bouncers and others convicted of 
nonviolent misdemeanor crimes to work at their regular jobs while serving their 
sentences. The minimum-security facility would be on the site of the Ventura 
Retirement Villa, a 146-bed home for elderly people requiring supervision but 
not medical care. 
</P>
<P>
It would be Los Angeles County's second privately run work furlough residence, 
said Carl Curtiss, program director for the county's Probation Department. A 
work furlough program with 220 beds opened recently in south Los Angeles, and 
Curtiss said the county hopes to establish more such facilities to relieve 
overcrowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the proposal among neighborhood residents so far is mixed. Members 
of the Studio City Homeowners Assn. last week voted 28 to 12 to oppose the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rubin, whose Long Beach-based company, Working Alternatives, submitted 
the proposal to convert the retirement home, said residents had nothing to 
fear. "This is not a program for serious felons," he said. "It's for Uncle 
George who drinks too much and Aunt Mary who doesn't pay her bills." 
</P>
<P>
Working Alternative's application for a conditional-use permit must be approved 
by the Planning Commission. A decision may be reached today, although the 
commission could also wait if there is much opposing testimony. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen to residents of the Ventura Retirement Villa, at 11201 Ventura 
Blvd., is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
The home's owner and operator, Donald Gormly, could not be reached for comment. 
The district manager for the state Department of Social Services, which 
licenses such facilities, said it had received no notice of plans to close. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Thomas, the department's district manager, said 85 of the home's 146 beds 
were filled during an inspection earlier this month. Thomas said residents and 
their guardians should be given adequate notice so they can make other 
arrangements, and she expressed surprise at plans to change the facility's use. 
</P>
<P>
Gormly would continue to operate the facility even if it began housing 
prisoners, according to Curtiss. Gormly is a vice president of Working 
Alternatives, Curtiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtiss and Rubin said participants in the work furlough program would be 
screened by the Probation Department and approved for assignment there by a 
judge. They would pay for their room and board on a sliding scale according to 
income. Residents would be strictly monitored and would be allowed to leave 
only for work. The facility would hire private parole officers to check on them 
at their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Some nearby residents want to keep the work furlough facility out, despite 
those assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is you don't take people that are felons . . . and put them in an 
area where there's very rich people shopping on one side of you and dope 
dealers on the other side . . . The temptations are too great," said real 
estate broker Mort Allen. He said the facility should be "in a blue-collar area 
like Ventura Boulevard and Magnolia." 
</P>
<P>
But Jerry Hays, former president of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce and a 
homeowners association board member, said the plan did not bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read about thousands of criminals being released by judges back into 
the community who have committed serious crimes because they have no facilities 
for them, I think that presents a lot more of a hazard to my community than a 
person who committed a stupid mistake," Hays said.

APPROVED DRUG INEFFECTIVE IN NEW ALZHEIMER'S STUDY

The only government-approved drug for treating Alzheimer's disease appears to 
be completely ineffective, researchers reported last week. A study involving 80 
people with the degenerative brain condition found no evidence that the drug 
Hydergine could improve their mental capacities, said Dr. Troy Thompson II of 
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, 39 Alzheimer's patients were given oral daily doses of Hydergine 
for 24 weeks while 41 patients received a placebo. Those in the Hydergine group 
averaged 72 years of age and those in placebo group had an average age of 70. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the study, participants were given a series of tests to measure 
their mental capacity. The tests were repeated after the 24-week treatment 
period. "The Hydergine-LC group did not perform better after treatment than the 
placebo group on any test," the researchers reported, "and its performance was 
worse" on one cognitive and one behavioral measure than that of the placebo 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The mental abilities of both groups deteriorated during the treatment, and 
there were indications from the test results that "the Hydergine-LC group 
actually had more deterioration than the placebo group."

ABORTION- RIGHTS GROUP PICKETS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15 abortion-rights activists picketed outside a large fundamentalist 
church in Van Nuys on Sunday in an effort to dissuade the congregation members 
from supporting Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion organization. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing bright yellow placards that read: "Dialogue is nothing to fear. 
</P>
<P>
We will listen to you, too," the demonstrators greeted members of the Church on 
the Way as they left Sunday morning services and handed out invitations to a 
meeting Sunday in the Van Nuys Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's peaceful demonstration was the second Sunday this month that the 
Irvine-based Coalition Against Christian Violence appeared at the Church on the 
Way at 14300 Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leaders Paul Courry and Larkette Lein, Episcopal crusaders for 
abortion rights, said they targeted the 8,000-member church because it supports 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
They allege that Operation Rescue uses tactics that are violent and harassing, 
including biting abortion-rights activists and blocking the entrances to 
clinics where abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Courry said that after the demonstration he met briefly with Church on the Way 
leaders, who asked him to stop picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hicks, director of pastoral care for Church on the Way, denied any official 
support for Operation Rescue and said the congregation has been unfairly 
targeted because of its size and prominence. 
</P>
<P>
He said some parishioners participate in Operation Rescue, but questioned why 
other churches that support the group are not picketed. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks said the church opposes abortion but does not "mean to raise social 
consciousness by anything other than prayer."

THIEVES ROB HOLOGRAM ART EXHIBIT FOR 2ND TIME IN WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in a week, thieves broke into a Santa Monica exhibit of 
holograms on Sunday, ripping 17 of the art pieces from walls or cutting wires 
that attached them to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know what to do," said J. William McGowan, chairman of the board 
of Associates of Science and Technology, coordinator of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm past the point of being able to speak coherently." 
</P>
<P>
Police said there was no sign of forced entry. McGowan speculated it was an 
"inside job" by someone with a key to the exhibit building. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 17 pieces taken Sunday were valued at about $40,000 and that the 
thieves took popular works rather than the most valuable pieces. Among the 
thefts were holograms of a telescope and microscope that viewers could look 
into and see objects. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 12, thieves stole about $50,000 worth of holograms from the same 
"Images in Time and Space" exhibit. McGowan said the eight pieces that were 
stolen or damaged last week had been replaced with other works. The 
replacements were among the pieces stolen this week.

MAN SEIZED AFTER 2 GUNFIGHTS IN 1 NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty sheriff's sergeant driving home from a gathering with his wife 
escaped injury early Sunday during a gun battle in the Florence area with an 
alleged would-be robber who was later captured after a second shoot-out with 
other deputies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Turner, 34, of Los Angeles, was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted armed robbery, said Sgt. 
Joaquin Herran, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Turner was being held without bail at County-USC Medical Center's jail ward, 
where he was treated for three gunshot wounds to a leg, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's sergeant and his wife, who were not identified, were driving home 
about 1 a.m. when a fast-moving car approached them from behind. When they 
pulled over to let it pass, the other car also pulled over and the driver got 
out and approached them, Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe he knew it was a police officer," Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
When the sergeant saw the man was carrying a handgun, he pulled out his weapon 
and shots were fired, Herran said. It was not known if the gunman was wounded 
then. The assailant returned to his car and sped off and the sergeant ran to a 
nearby house to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in a patrol car spotted the fleeing gunman five minutes later and 
chased him for eight blocks before the man's car crashed into a wall, Herran 
said. The gunman tried to run from the area, firing at the pursuing deputies. 
They returned fire and wounded the man, who was then captured, Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
Herran said the car that Turner was driving was reported stolen in Los Angeles 
on Saturday.

Davis Love III, making nine birdies on a day when two players had double 
eagles, scored a three-point victory over Steve Pate, Peter Senior of Australia 
and Eduardo Romero of Argentina in the International golf tournament Sunday at 
Castle Pines Golf Club in Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Only five double eagles were recorded in PGA Tour competition from 1987-1989, 
and there have been only two this season. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King held off Beth Daniel by three shots to win the $400,000 Big Apple 
tournament. King eagled the par-five, 475-yard 18th hole for a 68 and a 72-hole 
score of 273 at the 6,209-yard Wykagyl Country Club at New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Rives McBee fired a final-round 68 to win the Seniors Showdown event at Jeremy 
Ranch by one stroke. McBee's 54-hole total of 14-under-par 202 was a tournament 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sutherland of Sacramento shot a five-under-par 67 to win the Queen Mary 
Open by two shots at Lakewood Country Club. Mike Miles of Cypress and Alan 
Tapie of Newport Beach tied for second.

MIDEAST TURMOIL IS SALT IN WOUND OF TOKYO MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: EVEN BEFORE IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT, FEAR OF INFLATION POUNDED THE 
MARKET ALL YEAR. THE CURRENT WOES CONTRAST WITH 1987-89'S SUPER-LOW INTEREST 
RATES AND SURGE IN STOCK PRICES.

<P>
It has been a rough year for stocks in Tokyo, and the Middle East crisis has 
not helped. 
</P>
<P>
The current plunge in share prices, the second of the year, started even before 
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. It appears to be slowing down, but brokers agree 
that there is no light at the end of the tunnel yet. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the Persian Gulf crisis, conditions affecting the Tokyo stock 
market have changed fundamentally from the 1987-'89 era of super-low interest 
rates and booming stocks, according to Kenji Mizutani, managing director of 
Tokai Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Various factors -- double-digit increases in the money supply, a worsening 
labor shortage, rising exports, record low inventories and growing backlogs of 
orders -- have sparked worries of inflation, even though rising inflation so 
far has failed to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of higher interest rates have also bedeviled the market all year. After 
the central Bank of Japan in March raised rates for the fourth time since May, 
1989, concern mounted that there would be another increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion, and the ensuing turmoil in the world oil scene, simply has 
put a new damper on the market. By last Monday, the 225-stock Nikkei average 
hit a 1990 low of 26,176.43 -- down 33% from its all-time high at the end of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average zigzagged on news from the Persian Gulf last week, while 
many investors and dealers enjoyed their traditional summer holiday. The Nikkei 
recovered Tuesday and Wednesday but then lost some of those gains Thursday and 
Friday, closing the week at 26,786.72. 
</P>
<P>
Assurances by economists that Japan's economy stands to lose only 0.1% of its 
growth this year if oil prices stabilize at $25 a barrel or lower have failed 
to bolster the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Even as prices fell again Thursday, the newspaper Nihon Keizai reported that a 
survey of major corporations showed that investments would rise 16.4%, 
guaranteeing a third straight year of double-digit growth in investment. Most 
firms, the newspaper said, already have the needed funds in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Middle East crisis heated up concerns that the Bank of Japan 
will be forced to again raise the rate on loans that it makes to commercial 
banks, said Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital 
Markets, Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Weak prices of stock futures Friday doused hopes of a comeback. One broker 
predicted that the market would not find its bottom until the Nikkei fell to 
22,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tokai Bank's Mizutani, in a column written for the newspaper Asahi, warned that 
"compared with European and American stocks, the prices of Japanese stocks are 
too high." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say: "Expectations of capital gains that prevailed in the 
super-low interest era no longer exist. Other financial investments with 
fixed-interest returns have become more attractive. And with expectations that 
eventually higher interest rates will dampen economic growth, investors will be 
tempted to sell." 
</P>
<P>
A weakening of the yen contributed to the January-March stock plunge, and the 
currency skidded again right after the Iraqi invasion. But the Japanese 
currency, unlike the stock market, quickly started gaining value again. On 
Friday, in Tokyo, the yen closed at 147.35 to the dollar, compared to Monday's 
150.65 yen to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Recognition that Japan's economy is no longer linked directly to the price of 
oil, as it was in the 1970s, spurred hopes that the yen would not weaken as it 
did in the first two oil shocks. 
</P>
<P>
If these hopes are borne out, the Japanese economy will have to cope only with 
a "single punch" of higher oil prices, and not the added problem of a lower 
yen, which would effectively raise the cost of imported oil to Japan further. 
Anticipation of U.S. stagflation because of higher oil costs was bolstering the 
yen's value, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Energy costs, including petroleum, account for 7.6% of the consumer price index 
in the United States, but only 4.7% of the index in Japan, according to the 
Bank of Tokyo. And although Japan has a large trade surplus to pay for the 
higher costs of oil, increased oil costs for the United States could worsen 
America's trade imbalance, depressing the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Until the momentary decline after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the yen had 
gained ground on the dollar because of investors' expectations that the Federal 
Reserve Board would be forced to ease credit to cope with the slowdown in the 
American economy, said Takafumi Abe, director of the international treasury 
division of Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Abe predicted that the dollar will weaken further "once market participants 
lose interest in the Middle East turmoil (and) the focus of trading returns to 
the U.S. economy."

Electric Tool Slander Suit: Jepson Inc., a Torrance firm that sells electric 
tools made in Taiwan, filed a $10-million slander suit against New York-based 
Makita U.S.A. Inc., which sells similar tools from Japan. The federal suit in 
Los Angeles asserts that Makita launched a "campaign to harass the customers of 
Jepson" in 1986 by telling them that Jepson products infringed on Makita's 
trademark and that authorities would soon prevent their sales. 
</P>
<P>
Makita also advertised that consumers should "beware of imitation" tools and 
"poor-quality look-alikes" -- warnings that Jepson contends hurt its sales. 
Makita in 1988 complained to the International Trade Commission that Jepson and 
30 other firms infringed on its trademark, the suit said, but the ITC last year 
exonerated Jepson and all but one of the others. (Filed Aug. 13, 1990. Case No. 
90-4312.)

Chrysler's Golden Handshake: Chrysler Corp. is offering a buyout to its 
union-covered employees with as little as one year seniority to try to avoid 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Lee Sechler said 400 to 450 of about 60,000 Chrysler employees 
covered by a contract with the United Auto Workers union have signed up for the 
program. He declined to say how much it has cost or to give details of the 
formula used to arrive at the amount of an individual's buyout. Sechler said 
the computation would be based mainly on an employee's seniority with Chrysler.

CRISIS SPURS NEW INTEREST IN RISKY OIL AND GAS DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Middle East is driving up commodity prices and spurring a 
wave of speculation in such previously moribund investments as oil and gas 
limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
Investments in partnerships that promise to drill new wells are particularly 
strong, said Furman Nettles, vice president of Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a 
Shrewsbury, N.J., consulting firm. Only last year, oil and gas partnership 
sales hit a 12-year low. 
</P>
<P>
The theory behind the boom is that rising energy prices are increasing the 
value of oil discoveries, which in turn improves potential gains from drilling 
investments. Still, experts say the partnerships might not be bargains because 
of high risks, big up-front fees and hidden costs. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they say, it takes so long to turn investor money into a producing 
well or oil field that the recent price swing means little. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to take something longer-term than the Iraq situation" to improve 
fortunes for oil and gas investors, said John Owens, a partner at the 
accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although crude oil shot up to the upper $20s per barrel after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, no one is predicting $100-a-barrel oil as they were in the 
mid-1970s and early 1980s, when many energy partnerships were launched. 
Instead, industry experts believe oil prices will slide sharply as soon as 
there is some resolution to the Persian Gulf situation, before bouncing back 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
"We think prices are going to average $21 or $22 (a barrel) this year and 
increase by about $1 next year," said Timothy Curro, vice president of research 
at First Boston Corp. in New York. In 1992 and beyond, Curro expects about a 7% 
annual rate of increase in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas prices are another story, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The natural gas market is depressed by a "bubble" of oversupply. Normally, the 
cost of 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas should be one-sixth the price of a 
barrel of oil, said Nettles. In other words, when oil was selling at $18 a 
barrel, 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas should have been about $3. 
</P>
<P>
Now that oil is selling in the high $20s, natural gas should be selling around 
$4, Nettles said. But with the oversupply, natural gas is selling for $1.50 to 
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Nettles expects the natural gas glut to ease even if the Mideast crisis is 
quickly resolved, making investments in these partnerships more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
However, investing in any type of limited partnership is risky. 
</P>
<P>
First, many partnerships are privately traded. That means investors might have 
a hard time selling. Moreover, without a public market, it is difficult to 
determine their true value without a costly audit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these partnerships typically charge upfront fees ranging from 9% 
to 15% of the original investment. Some partnerships have additional hidden 
costs, Nettles said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an oil drilling partnership may promise to give investors 99% of 
revenues produced by a well until they get back 100% of their original 
investment. Sounds good? What investors may not realize is that their 99% comes 
after the partnership pays its expenses, which just might include a 12.5% fee 
to the land owner; a 6.5% fee to the "land man" who helped find the property, 
and another large chunk to a driller. 
</P>
<P>
In some notorious cases, the contractors have had ties to the partnership's 
promoter. Not surprisingly, the promoter made a fortune while investors earned 
virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also need to be wary of con artists who exploit market fears to sell 
bogus partnerships. Already, state regulators said, there has been an upswing 
in commodities scams, including some oil and gas deals. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the best cases, limited partnerships often do not produce high enough 
returns to compensate for the risks, Nettles said. Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co. 
studied returns on oil and gas partnerships and found that investors got back 
$1.40 for every $1 they put in over a 10-year period. That's a lower return 
than on Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
If investors are lucky enough to find a well-run partnership that comes across 
a big find, they can make hefty returns. There can be tax benefits, too. 
</P>
<P>
Still, experts say that no one should invest based on a potentially short-term 
event such as the Persian Gulf crisis. Not only could the crisis end quickly, 
other countries could boost oil production and create a price-depressing glut. 
</P>
<P>
Nettles' firm has a 900 number that provides information on, among other 
things, partnerships' past returns and the value of their reserves. The 
service, which costs $5 a minute, can be reached at 900-786-9600.

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT: SSI'S HEDGING WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistical Sciences Inc. has preached its novel stock market hedge strategy 
for 17 years. But nothing makes the word "hedge" sound so interesting as a bear 
market -- such as the one Wall Street appears to be in. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based SSI, founded by John D. Gottfurcht in 1973, manages $260 
million for about 60 clients, including Pepperdine University and Hawaiian 
Airlines. The firm is little-known in L.A. money circles, yet Gottfurcht and 
his staff of 20 claim an enviable investing record: 
</P>
<P>
* SSI's basic stock-picking plan, called Profits Plus, beat the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index in seven of 10 years in the 1980s, SSI says. 
</P>
<P>
* Profits Plus 70, a conservative stock plan that on average invests 70% of a 
client's money in stocks and 30% in cash investments, beat a similar 
S&amp;P/cash portfolio in eight of the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
* The SSI Hedge plan, a stock program designed for ultraconservative investors 
who would otherwise stick with short-term Treasury bills or other safe havens, 
has beaten Treasury bill returns six of the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Hedge plan that sets SSI apart from most money managers. Traditional 
hedge programs try to protect stock portfolios from sharp market declines by 
using futures or index options contracts. Those instruments are sold at a 
locked-in price while the stocks are bought. So, in theory, the portfolio is 
hedged if the stocks plunge. 
</P>
<P>
SSI hedges in a different way. Each time it buys a stock that it believes is 
poised to advance, it also "sells-short" the weakest-looking stock in the same 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In a short sale, you borrow stock and sell it, betting that you can replace the 
loaned shares later at a lower price. If the stock indeed drops, your profit is 
the difference between the price you got in the sale and what you pay to 
purchase the stock later to cover the loan. If the stock rises, you lose. 
</P>
<P>
Short-selling has a foul reputation, mostly because some short-selling pros 
have used nasty tactics -- such as spreading lies about a firm -- to make their 
shorted stocks drop. 
</P>
<P>
So, not surprisingly, SSI has faced a major marketing job in pitching its Hedge 
program to some big investors -- particularly pension funds, which are subject 
to close public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, John Gottfurcht says, SSI is the antithesis of the traditional gunslinging 
short trader. SSI uses short sales solely as a means to a conservative end -- a 
hedge -- rather than as a speculative tool for big gains, he says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, to balance a "long" position in Procter &amp; Gamble, the Hedge 
portfolio has shorted Clorox. If consumer stocks in general zoom, SSI figures 
that P&amp;G will lead -- which it did in the spring bull market. If those 
stocks plunge, SSI figures, Clorox looks weakest. Hence, the hedge. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Hedge plan has a long position in Texaco and a short position in 
Ashland Oil. That has worked well, as the stock of oil producers such as Texaco 
has jumped with higher oil prices, while stock of refiners such as Ashland has 
been pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea we had in 1973 was to develop a strategy where we could do well in 
all different types of market environments," Gottfurcht said. The Hedge plan 
isn't aimed at aggressive investors, he said, but at investors who want 
controlled risk and consistency of return -- but something better than what 
T-bills pay. 
</P>
<P>
In the current market slump, SSI's hedge portfolio is a standout. Year to date, 
it's up 9%, the firm says. In contrast, an investor who stayed in T-bills has 
earned about 5%. Meanwhile, the market, measured by the S&amp;P 500, is down 
5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a forgone conclusion, Gottfurcht notes, that a portfolio hedged with 
short sales will under-perform the market when the vast majority of stocks are 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
That's why hedging was such a tough sell in the 1980s, when the bull market 
raged, said Amy Jo Gottfurcht, who as SSI's executive vice president has built 
the company with husband John since 1982. "In the 1970s nobody understood 
hedging, and in the 1980s nobody wanted it," she said. But in the '90s, she 
said, the return to careful stock picking bodes well for hedging -- because 
careful stock analysis will identify many probable losers as well as probable 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
And in fact, short-sale techniques are finally gaining acceptance among a 
growing number of pension funds and other big investors. Pensions &amp; 
Investment Age magazine reported in April that big investors had pumped about 
$950 million into short-sale strategies during the previous year -- an amount 
unheard-of in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many pension funds, in particular, face barriers to short-sale investing, 
and even those that use the strategy generally refuse to discuss it. Imagine, 
for example, a pension fund shorting the stock of the company whose employees 
are the pension beneficiaries. That might be difficult for many of the 
employees to accept, even if they thought it was a smart investment move. 
</P>
<P>
Even if SSI faces a tough challenge selling the Hedge program, its 
stock-picking ability under its Profits Plus plans could win the firm greater 
recognition in the '90s. So far this year, the Profits Plus portfolio is down 
just 1%, versus the market's 5.7% loss, and Profits Plus 70 is up 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
With a strong long-term record, why isn't SSI managing a lot more than $260 
million? Besides the difficulty in marketing the Hedge plan, Gottfurcht 
maintains that SSI has in general spent little time prospecting. Many clients 
have come as referrals from others. And some rival money managers say the 
Gottfurchts simply don't sell their message well. 
</P>
<P>
SSI's strategy is computer-driven, which John Gottfurcht says was his 
orientation from the start. The firm uses a wealth of historical data on market 
trends and individual stock trends to guide its market timing and stock 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The basic question is the same that any investor asks: How do I buy low and 
sell high? SSI breaks the question down into individual stock price building 
blocks, such as price-to-earnings ratio trends and corporate asset values. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, SSI focuses heavily on money-flow trends, identifying patterns 
that indicate when a stock is building up to heavy buying -- or selling -- by 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jo Gottfurcht, who manages the computer operations, says a key to SSI's 
success is constant experimentation with historical data to determine "what 
events make a difference with a stock and what events are redundant" compared 
to what SSI already knows. 
</P>
<P>
In late June, the company's computer model turned negative enough to warrant a 
pullback from stocks, which has helped minimize the damage to SSI's portfolios 
compared to the market. 
</P>
<P>
For now, SSI is a firm for big investors only (its minimum is $250,000). John 
Gottfurcht says a pooled investment fund for smaller investors has been 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
As for SSI's unheralded status in the Southland, Gottfurcht says he has no 
regrets spending more time on computer models than on marketing. "If our 
strategy weren't so complex, a lot of other people would have been doing the 
same thing," he said. 
</P>

SSI'S LONG-TERM RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Here is how two conservative investment plans of the money management firm 
Statistical Sciences Inc. have fared since 1980, compared to benchmark 
conservative measures. The Hedge plan is aimed at investors who want consistent 
performance and controlled risk. The Profits Plus 70 plan is for investors who 
aim for 70% of their portfolio in stocks and the other 30% in cash investments, 
on average.

MARKET BEAT: INVESTORS GO FOR THE GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who are all those gold bugs out there, pushing the price of the metal up with 
every nervous tick in the Mideast? They're your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Southland coin dealers say they're suddenly doing a booming business in sales 
of one-ounce pure gold coins such as the American Eagle, Canadian Maple Leaf 
and Australian Kangaroo: 
</P>
<P>
* Calls for information on gold coins are up 50% in the past few weeks at 
Miracle Mile Coin Center on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles, says partner Wayne 
Wojdak. 
</P>
<P>
* At the Gold &amp; Silver Emporium in Encino, Barry Stuppler says his sales 
volume in gold coins has tripled this month. 
</P>
<P>
* Wes Bakke, who runs the Coin Shoppe in Fountain Valley, says he has sold 200 
Eagle coins alone during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to buy the coins was sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 
which gave a sharp boost to the market price of gold. But dealers note that the 
metal had been rising even before the Iraqi invasion, from a low of about $350 
an ounce in late June. Friday, gold closed at $409.60 on the spot market in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the Mideast situation behind this; it's economic worries, too," 
Wojdak said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, professional money managers have long advised individuals to follow the 
European tradition of keeping at least 5% to 10% of one's investment portfolio 
in gold, purely as a safeguard against world calamity. The idea is that, if 
inflation were to soar, or the economy were to plunge into a depression, gold 
might be one of the few investments to hold its value. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, no one knows whether gold bullion would indeed be such a great 
investment if the world were to fall apart. Some coin dealers admit that many 
of the buyers they're seeing are jumping into gold not to hold it forever, but 
to try and make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, if you're interested in buying gold coins from area coin shops, 
here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Expect to pay 4% to 6% over the spot price of gold for a one-ounce American 
Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf, the two most popular coins. Friday afternoon, for 
example, the Gold &amp; Silver Emporium was selling Eagles and Maple Leafs for 
$426 a piece, compared to the spot gold price of $409.60. Miracle Mile Coin 
Center was quoting $427 for an Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
* Many of the coins are available in smaller sizes, but you'll pay a much 
greater premium. A half-ounce Eagle, for example, was selling for $221 on 
Friday at Miracle Mile Coin Center. That's an 8% premium over the spot price of 
a half-ounce of gold. 
</P>
<P>
* You can avoid paying 6.75% California state sales tax on your purchase if you 
buy more than $1,000 in gold. 
</P>
<P>
* A dealer may not be able to deliver your coins the same day; you may have to 
wait a day or so for a shipment from a wholesaler. In such cases, a dealer may 
ask for a 10% down payment and the balance when you pick up the coins. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan to store your coins in a secure place -- preferably in the safe deposit 
department of a major bank. "These coins are generic -- like a $20 bill," 
Stuppler says. If they're stolen, they're virtually untraceable and a thief 
could sell them anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
* You can buy South African Krugerrands, the original gold coin, for $10 to $12 
less than an Eagle or Maple Leaf. But many dealers advise against Krugerrands 
because they are less marketable, because of the emotional issue of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Stock Fund Owners Stay Calm: Despite mounting concerns last week about the 
Mideast crisis and the economy, mutual fund companies say stock fund 
redemptions slowed dramatically from the previous week. Fidelity Investments in 
Boston says its outflow from stock funds last week was one-sixth that of the 
previous week. "The sentiment on the phones is much different," said Neil 
Litvack, vice president for marketing. "We're still getting calls from people 
who are concerned," he said. But they're calling to talk rather than sell. 
"Most of them are just saying things like, 'I know I'll make out fine after 
this is over,' " Litvack said. 
</P>
<P>
T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore-based fund giant, says that so far in 
August, its stock funds have seen only a 1% net asset loss from redemptions. 
Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston says its outflow has been 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Have all the sellers finally been shaken from the market? Philip Roth, 
technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, doubts it. The Dow Jones 
industrial index rallied back from a 63-point loss at midday Friday to close 
off 36.64 at 2,644.80. But Roth believes that's a bad sign, because he didn't 
see real conviction in the buying. "What we need to see is a good rally" to 
restore some faith that the Mideast and economic traumas aren't the end of the 
world, he said. Until then, half-hearted rallies that fade will just deepen the 
pessimism, he said. "I don't see the conditions yet for a good bottom," Roth 
said. If the Dow can't hold around 2,640 to 2,650, the next stop could be 
2,500, he said.

stock on NASDAQ's National Market System. The stock ($8.50 on Friday) now 
trades in the secondary over-the-counter market.

PARK'N PAY: All-day parking rates at John Wayne Airport will climb from $12 to 
$14 if the county supervisors approve a county staff proposal Tuesday. The 
price would drop to $7 on the third day and the $1 hourly rate would remain the 
same. . . . The new prices are scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 16, when 
the Thomas F. Riley Terminal opens. . . . "We're providing more service for the 
money," an airport spokeswoman says. "People are getting covered parking, and 
it's very convenient." Lanie Jones and Frank Messina

MORE WATER: What a difference a year makes. This time last year, the volume of 
water in the main reservoir serving San Clemente dropped to its lowest in 
history -- 17.3 million gallons -- jolting city officials into enacting a 
series of rationing laws that are the toughest in Orange County. Now, thanks to 
restrictions on lawn watering, building and excessive-use penalties, along with 
voluntary conservation, the 48-million-gallon-capacity reservoir has reached 
44.3 million gallons. Lanie Jones and Frank Messina

LATEST RAGE IN STATE CAPITOL IS O.C.-BASHING 
</P>

<P>
In your face, Orange County. Increasingly frustrated legislators from around 
the state are saying just that to their ideologically intractable colleagues 
from California's bastion of suburban Republicanism. 
</P>
<P>
The message reverberates in private interviews and public debate. And it was 
painfully clear last week when the Assembly roughed up a series of bills 
dealing with one of the county's pet projects: toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled lower house seized on the bills as a way 
to temporarily humble the Orange County delegation, which they accuse of being 
legislative obstructionists and unrelenting Scrooges when it comes to the poor 
and needy. 
</P>
<P>
Still raw over the budget battle and irked that privately financed roads were 
approved in the first place, Democrats used parliamentary procedure to hold up 
the toll-road bills and deliver a tongue-lashing to the peers they often deride 
as "cavemen." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's some Orange County-bashing going on, and I'm enjoying the hell 
out of it," Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) declared after the floor 
fight over the bills, which come up for another vote today. 
</P>
<P>
"The silk-stocking guys are going to be taking their lumps because, quite 
frankly, a lot of people are recognizing that people like me, areas like mine, 
we're getting screwed over," he said. "The more misery they endure, far as I 
see it, is just retribution for their activities in voting everything down that 
there is." 
</P>
<P>
Such venom against Orange County isn't new, says Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), whose derogatory remarks about homosexuals and war against 
liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) make him one of the most 
infamous of the local delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson chalks up the hard feelings to old-fashioned partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's always that residue of feeling among the majority party that 
the Republicans are rooted in Orange County, and I think they would rather not 
have anything go to Orange County," he said. "But, at the same time, they have 
to have Republicans on their biggest and most important votes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What they would like to do is harm us, but then on second thought, they 
shouldn't do it. After having their say, making their points and voting against 
us, they immediately put up their green lights and let the bills go out." 
</P>
<P>
Gentility in the 40-member Senate, where more moderate county representatives 
like Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) and Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
work, generally prevents such open skirmishes and regionalism. There, 
conservative senators are just as likely to hail from Rohnert Park and Fresno 
as from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But in the more raucous 80-member Assembly, the relationship between Orange 
County and the rest of the state is more precarious. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) can only lay claim to 45 
Democrats. When he is able to hold his independently minded scouts together, 
the number is more than the simple majority of 41 needed to pass most bills. 
That number is also more than the simple majority Brown needs to retain his 
hold on the speakership, which appoints committee chairmen and runs floor 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
However, it falls short when the chamber needs a two-thirds vote to pass 
emergency measures, tax increases and the budget. The task for the Democrats is 
to woo enough Republicans to tally 54 votes on those crucial measures. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the two-thirds rule is a bottleneck to Democrats but an occasional 
opportunity of power for Assembly Republicans. And it sets the stage for a 
never-ending political dance that inevitably includes the archconservative 
gavotte of the Orange County delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) is leader of the 33 Republicans in the 
lower house, responsible for rallying his troops and representing their 
viewpoint in negotiations with legislative leaders and Gov. George Deukmejian. 
He is also involved with running Republican legislative campaigns outside the 
Capitol, hoping to either hold onto or increase conservative seats in the 
Assembly numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, the mastermind behind those Republican legislative campaigns 
was Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange). Before sitting out this year, Lewis 
matched wits against Willie Brown's operatives in a series of hardball 
political campaigns that earned him the universal enmity of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Also sticking in the Democrats' craw is Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove), who squeaked out a victory in the only Democratic Assembly district in 
the county. Democrats are ever mindful of the controversy surrounding Pringle's 
victory -- charges that he and the Orange County Republican Party intimidated 
Latino voters by posting uniformed security guards at Democratic polling places 
in Santa Ana. Last year, some of the defendants in the lawsuit settled with the 
Latino plaintiffs for about $480,000. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Capitol, Orange County Republicans have proven just as nettlesome. 
Bent on reducing the size of government, people like Ferguson, Dennis Brown 
(R-Los Alamitos) and Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) are eager to hit the 
red "no" button for existing or increased programs and spending. Meanwhile, 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) has angered some Democratic leaders with 
her stubborn campaign to ban gill nets off Southern California shores, a 
proposal she managed to get on the November ballot. Mild-mannered Robert C. 
Frazee (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes San Clemente, is on the outs 
because he decided to take a vacation in July when Speaker Brown was counting 
on him to help break the budget deadlock, according to capital insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has come to symbolize ardent right-wing enthusiasm that acts as a 
centrifugal force, pulling the Republican caucus to the right on such issues as 
abortion and spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd is more pointed in his description of the Orange County officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all Republicans, aren't they? And they're all Neanderthals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County legislators were sympathetic to the kind of budget cuts this year 
that created the summer's fiscal crisis and resulted in more than $750 million 
being axed by Gov. Deukmejian from social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Their part in the budget drama, with leader Johnson serving as the public point 
man for Assembly Republicans, has sparked widespread muttering in the capital 
about the tyranny of the two-thirds voting rule. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Democrats returned the favor when they attacked a trio of 
Orange County toll-road bills up for floor approval. 
</P>
<P>
The measures, requested by the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, 
were presented as inconsequential measures that would help reduce the costs in 
selling the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
One would have allowed all 15 Orange County cities in the toll-road corridors 
to hold a consolidated public hearing before raising tolls or developer fees. 
Republicans requested a two-thirds vote so that the bill could pass as an 
emergency measure and go into effect immediately after Deukmejian signed it. 
</P>
<P>
A second bill would have permitted the transportation corridor agencies to use 
the tolls on one of the three private roadways to help pay for construction on 
any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) led Northern California Democrats in 
attacking the measures. He said that despite promises that developers and 
motorists would fund Orange County toll-road construction, the county is in 
line to receive $35 million in state highway funds -- money set aside to help 
build 15 miles of the toll roads. The county is also asking for another $11 
million, a California Department of Transportation spokeswoman said last week. 
</P>
<P>
During the Assembly debate, Areias called the toll-road bills a "sinking 
Titanic." He was particularly critical of the bill that would allow 
consolidated hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this bill is part of a registration drive for Republicans because when 
it passes and developer fees are raised without a check by the public, no 
Democrat's going to be able to afford Orange County," Areias said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Republican leader Johnson drew attention to the fact that Northern 
California structures such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco charge 
tolls. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll volunteer . . . to elevate the roadways in Orange County, run a garden 
hose under them and call them a bridge," he said. "That way, all you Northern 
California hypocrites can be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Areias, a longtime foe of toll roads, accused Orange County of its own brand of 
hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, what these Republicans are doing is asking for taxation without 
representation," he said. "What it smacks of to me is it's OK as long as it is 
special-interest developers in Orange County building projects in Orange 
County. . . . That's contrary to what we hear all the time from these folks." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Seymour, who lobbied on the Assembly floor for the measures Thursday, said 
afterward that he heard other gripes about Orange County: Why have its 
residents refused to enact a 1-cent county sales tax for transportation? Why 
did they vote in June against Proposition 111, the ballot measure that passed 
statewide and added a 5-cent gasoline sales tax to help pay for transportation 
projects? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the members said: 'Orange County hasn't passed a sales tax, and they 
didn't vote for Proposition 111 either. Therefore, I don't like Orange County, 
and I'm going to vote against this because Orange County wants to do it this 
way,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he approached Brown during the floor debate and asked why the 
bills were being hamstrung. He said the Speaker looked right at him and said, 
"We're going to kill those damn bills." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Assembly Democrats refused to give their Republican brethren 
the two-thirds vote needed to pass the consolidated-hearing measure as an 
emergency bill. It is likely to pass today but only as a regular measure that 
goes into effect next year -- a wait that toll-road officials had clearly 
wanted to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
The other two measures actually passed Thursday but were pulled back and 
stalled at the last minute when Areias asked for reconsideration today. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour and Frazee said Areias used the procedural tactic at Brown's urging. 
</P>

Brown's office would not comment Friday on the toll-road bills. But Floyd said 
Orange County would eventually get its bills -- after getting a message.

"The governor will sign it all, but some of us are just damned sick and tired 
of . . . Orange County legislators with their . . . attitude towards the rest

recognize it."

<P>
In summers past, Dee Edling has cooled off each evening in her back yard and 
watched the sun set over the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Not this year. Not as long as the mosquitoes are around. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been covered," Edling said. "I go outside and just get eaten alive." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the drought drying up some potential mosquito breeding grounds, Norco 
and Corona officials are mobilizing their biggest assault on mosquitoes in at 
least six years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let the kids go out after sunset," Edling said. "And sometimes 
(mosquitoes) get inside, and I have to get up and spray the house." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Nathan, who has lived in Norco for 22 years, says the 
infestation is "the worst we've seen it." 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic sign of the mosquito problem came during the last week in 
July, when the average number of mosquitoes found in mosquito traps climbed 
from 125 to 379, said Dr. Major Dhillon, an entomologist with the Northwest 
Mosquito Abatement District. Normally, only about 100 would be found in Norco 
traps at this time of the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Greenbriar section of Corona, as many as 800 mosquitoes were found in 
each trap, Dhillon said, up from an expected 500. 
</P>
<P>
These mosquitoes, the Culex tarsalis and the Culex quinquefasciatus, or quinqs, 
generally breed in stagnant water along the river and bite at night, Dhillon 
said. He has been monitoring the population by setting about 45 traps a week. 
The traps include several pounds of dry ice, which serve as a lure by giving 
off carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how the mosquitoes find their host 'blood meal,' " Dhillon said. "They 
sense that it is a little bird or animal." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the cause of the mosquito outbreak is a mystery. Some officials point 
to the hotter and more humid weather, which provides prime conditions for 
breeding. Although there has been a drought, water collects when residents 
water their lawns or wash their cars. 
</P>
<P>
In Norco and Corona, the mosquito abatement district has had trouble getting to 
some breeding grounds, including jungle-like areas along the Santa Ana River 
and small duck ponds, exacerbating the problem, Dhillon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could say that the drought has brought the population down, but I 
can't," said Lino Luna, the manager of the district. "We still have water and 
that's where mosquitoes will go. A lot of the problems are man-made." 
</P>
<P>
The assault on the mosquito is being waged on two fronts. For the first time in 
half a dozen years, officials have taken to the air and doused about 500 acres 
along the Santa Ana River, including the bluffs area of Norco and the 
Greenbriar section of Corona, with a pesticide called Bti, a bacterial agent 
that attacks mosquito larvae but is harmless to humans and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide was sprayed once in May and once last week, Dhillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Even more concentrated efforts to control the mosquitoes are being made at 
about a dozen dairy farms north and west of Norco. There, district officials 
fear that a different type of mosquito, the Aedes dorsalis, will get out of 
control. This so-called "dirty water" mosquito can begin breeding in mud 
deposits, which are common on dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
Up until last summer, the Aedes mosquito was seldom found in the district, 
Dhillon said. This year's discovery is worrisome because the Aedes can grow 
into adulthood in about four days, a much shorter maturing time than for other 
mosquitoes. Even more troublesome, they bite during the day and their eggs can 
lay dormant for as long as 10 years before hatching, Dhillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews are now checking some dairies twice a week and ground-spraying the areas 
every seven days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate even one of those mosquitoes," Dhillon said. "If we didn't 
control it this year, it would be a real big problem." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Vector Control District officials are concerned about the 
threat of an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a viral disease carried by the 
mosquito that can be transmitted to birds and humans. The virus can cause 
headaches, flu-like symptoms and, in extreme cases, coma and death. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 19 of 293 birds caught in about a dozen traps throughout Orange County 
tested positive for the virus, a number 10 to 20 times higher than in recent 
summers, said Vector Control biologist Jim Webb. Fifteen of the birds that 
tested positive were trapped in Huntington Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, four people in Orange County are being tested by state health officials 
for the virus, Webb said. In addition, a Moreno Valley man, who is an 
electrician at Disneyland, is suspected of contracting the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still debatable whether he got it at Disneyland or in Moreno Valley," 
Webb said. "He said that he sometimes sleeps outside on hot evenings." 
</P>
<P>
Samples were taken of birds at Disneyland, and four of 140 birds, or about 3%, 
tested positive for encephalitis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No cases have been reported in the northwest district of Riverside County, 
Dhillon said.

KENNEDY SCHOOL DEDICATION TODAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John F. Kennedy Elementary School, 1300 E. McFadden Ave., quietly opened to 
approximately 840 students earlier this summer, but the Santa Ana Unified 
School District will celebrate the official opening of its newest elementary 
school today. 
</P>
<P>
The district will begin ribbon-cutting ceremonies at 6 p.m. in the presence of 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, Superintendent Rudy M. Castruita and School Board 
President Audrey Yomagata-Noji. 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the new school will be available at that time. Entertainment for the 
evening will be provided by an elementary school troupe of Cambodian dancers 
and a choral group from Century High School. The public is invited. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, a two-story, red-brick structure, is located on six acres of land near 
residential and industrial areas. The school's 33,000 square feet contain 19 
classrooms, a library and a multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
Students attending Kennedy spent nearly two years attending classes at a 
temporary school site made up of portable classrooms. Classes at the new school 
will be year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of new schools will become common within the next few years as the 
district prepares to build 11 more elementary schools to house a population 
growing at a rate of about 1,000 students per year. Other schools recently 
opened include Century High School, which opened last fall, and Jose Andres 
Sepulveda Elementary, which opened in the spring. GREG HERNANDEZ

CONSERVATION CORPS PROVIDES WORK SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Gill, 21, of Seal Beach, dropped out of school in the ninth grade and 
since then, he says, he hasn't been doing "much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
But for the next 12 months, that will change as Gill joins 150 other volunteers 
who left last week to begin their time with the California Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The corps began recruiting in Orange County this summer in search of young 
people to join its program of clearing trails, building rock walls, landscaping 
freeways and reforesting hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the first group of Orange County recruits got to work on the first 
phase of their corps experience, a year that, as the corps motto boasts, will 
be filled by "hard work, low pay, miserable conditions . . . and more!" 
</P>
<P>
An average day for a corps member starts at 5:30 a.m. with physical training 
exercises, followed by a rigorous regimen of natural resource work and, when 
needed, emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The corps is sometimes called in to help tackle emergency situations -- 
volunteers helped battle the Huntington Beach oil spill cleanup in February and 
are often asked to back up firefighters battling forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gill, a number of the corps members are school dropouts with few 
marketable skills, and the corps helps them develop skills that will increase 
their job opportunities after the program. 
</P>
<P>
Some volunteers sign up because they are interested in preserving the 
environment, and many go on to become firefighters, park rangers, recreation 
directors and landscapers. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Newbern, 23, of Torrance, said he joined the corps because he wants to 
become a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Newbern has only been a corps member for five months, he already has 
assisted in fighting two forest fires. He said he believes the fire training 
will give him the chance to get one step closer to his dream. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great program," Newbern said. "If you want to become a firefighter, the 
corps is the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
And for some of the volunteers -- as well as some of their parents -- the 
program represents a chance to test their adulthood in a strictly controlled 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gill, a contractor from Seal Beach, wants his son Kenneth to learn to be a 
little more responsible, and said he thinks the corps will teach him to be 
exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds to me like it's a little bit of an Army-indoctrinated type deal where 
you have to be a little bit more responsible as far as doing your own laundry 
and cleaning up your own mess," Gill said. "I think it'll give him a little 
more self-discipline." HAROLD TILLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

<P>
SURVEY OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS COMPLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of exhaustive research and many walks around the city, Tustin's 
Cultural Resource Committee produced a survey of the city's historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a labor of love," said Councilwoman Leslie Anne Pontious after the 
report was presented to the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
The survey identified 271 pre-1940 buildings, 94 of which were rated as 
"premier historic resources" on the basis of their historic significance, 
architectural style and uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
"Tustin has the largest amount of pre-1890 houses in Orange County," said Diann 
Marsh, an architectural historian with Thirtieth Street Architects of Newport 
Beach, the consulting firm that prepared the survey. "There are some really 
rare houses, some really fine Italianate and Greek Revival houses." 
</P>
<P>
The five member committee -- John Sauers, Brent Ferdig, Richard Vining, Jeff 
Thompson and Robert Edgell -- met 13 times to complete the report. 
</P>
<P>
For committee chairman John Sauers, who has lived in Tustin all his 74 years, 
the report brought back many memories. When he was growing up, the town was a 
farm community and his classmates at Tustin High School included teen-agers 
from Laguna Beach who arrived each day in a Pierce Arrow bus. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also brought back memories for Marsh, who graduated from Tustin High 
in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
"It's grown so much but yet that old part is so much like it was," Marsh said. 
"It's really very charming." 
</P>
<P>
Although nearby Orange might be better known for its historic area, Tustin has 
far more Victorian houses -- one of the most impressive collections in the 
county, Marsh said. The report identified 31 Victorian homes ranging in size 
from cottages to mansions. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the committee made several recommendations, including expanding 
the historic zoning district to include two areas north of 1st Street that 
contain a number of bungalows dating to the 1920s. The district provides a 
framework for preserving significant structures. 
</P>
<P>
The district is generally bounded by 1st Street, 6th Street, the Costa Mesa 
Freeway and Prospect Avenue, roughly the same area as the original town. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also recommended that the city work with residents to revitalize 
the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
"The downtown area is kind of dead," Sauers said. "We kid about rolling up the 
sidewalks at 6 o'clock, but we want to see what we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
At the last council meeting, Mayor Richard B. Edgar suggested setting up a town 
hall meeting to discuss the future of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also in the process of forwarding the report to the State Office of 
Historic Preservation, City Manager William A. Huston said. With state approval 
of a local program, Tustin would become eligible for state and federal funds 
for projects such as renovations, history studies or moving historic houses.

BATTLE FOR PARKLAND HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents won an important battle last week to keep a Burnett-Ehline/William 
Lyon Co. development out of Santiago Creek, but they still are a long way from 
realizing their dream to make the 37-acre site into a public park. 
</P>
<P>
After more than four years of public hearings and plan revisions, last week the 
City Council rejected the developers' proposal to build 160 homes and a 
shopping plaza on the site of the former Santiago Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Now residents want the council to consider their proposal for the land, and 
leaders of a neighborhood coalition will present a preliminary plan to the City 
Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of five neighborhood groups has pledged to work with the city to 
raise funds to buy the land, which is owned by the Burnett-Ehline and William 
Lyon development companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to talk with the council formally about what could 
happen with the space because there has always been a development proposal 
before them," said Ralph Masek, president of the Santiago Homeowners Assn., one 
of the groups involved. "We are going to ask for their support because we can't 
do anything without their cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
State grants sought by the group require City Council approval, but so far the 
council has not agreed to cooperate in any partnership with residents. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have not announced future plans for the site. However, Lynn 
Burnett, principal of the Burnett-Ehline Co., said the company would consider 
selling the land to the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the land is sold, the next owner will have several problems to resolve. The 
site is designated in the city's general plan for an extension of La Veta 
Avenue from Cambridge Street to Tustin Avenue. An amendment to the general plan 
would be necessary to delete the four-lane thoroughfare, and the city would 
need to find another east-west traffic route. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said it is impossible to create an alternate plan for the site without 
knowing the fate of La Veta. Residents have strongly protested an extension of 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also are concerned about 22 abandoned homes on Rosewood Avenue which 
would be demolished under the original Burnett-Ehline proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett-Ehline last week requested that the city take action on the La Veta 
extension, and the council agreed to discuss the issue at its Sept. 11 meeting.

PACKARD TO MEET WITH CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To keep abreast of developments in Washington, the City Council will hold a 
breakfast meeting with Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the agenda are several issues being discussed in Congress that will directly 
affect San Clemente, including the Border Patrol checkpoint, offshore oil 
drilling and a proposed regional airport in South County, said City Manager 
Michael T. Parness. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get together with him a couple times each year to touch bases on 
current issues," Parness said, "and get some input from Congressman Packard on 
what's happening in Washington that's important to us." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is open to the public, will be at 8 a.m. in the Ole Hanson 
Room of the city's Community Center, 100 N. Calle Seville. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics to be discussed will be the proposed airport, which has been 
proposed for Cristianitos Canyon, just east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and Packard strongly oppose the site, which has also been turned 
down by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport is a major issue to the city," Parness said. "Yet I don't think 
we'll talk much about it because (Packard) is so solidly behind us on this." 
</P>
<P>
Although Parness is in regular contact with Packard or his aides, the city 
manager said direct conversations between the legislator and the council are 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for him to sit and talk face to face with the City 
Council and simply make contact with them," Parness said. "He gets a better 
feel for the issues and our range of concerns." FRANK MESSINA

CITY GRAPPLES WITH NEW POLICY ON SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The candidates haven't even gotten out of the starting blocks, and already this 
city's November election is causing a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the mudslinging here isn't among those vying for seats. Instead, the City 
Council is battling it out over a law that restricts where and when candidates 
can put up endorsement signs. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed ordinance, placards could be placed in city-owned parkways -- 
the area between the sidewalk and the curb -- without the adjacent property 
owners' consent. It would also eliminate an existing clause which prohibits 
signs from being put up more than 30 days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians are going to be able to place signs between the curb and sidewalk, 
and you don't have the right to take it down," said Councilman Don R. Griffin, 
who opposes the changes. "I think it is a disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
However, attorney Andrew Arczynski, who provides legal counsel for Buena Park, 
said the city's current restrictions are unconstitutional. Recent court 
decisions prohibit cities from treating political signs and nonpolitical signs 
differently, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park is the latest city in Orange County to grapple with the question of 
political signs, and its neighbors have arrived at a variety of ways to address 
the issue. Some cities view the signs as essential to the political process, 
while others see them simply as trash. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, candidates just know better than to put signs up at all, said 
Verna L. Rollinger, city clerk for that coastal city. "Most candidates are 
sensitive enough to know that signs are an issue in this town, and they don't 
do it," Rollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Political signs are not specifically addressed in Laguna Beach's city code. 
They are lumped with other sign restrictions, leaving commercial property as 
one of the only places they are allowed, Rollinger said, adding, "Basically, we 
are not big on political signs." 
</P>
<P>
However, pass through Huntington Beach during election time, and it's a 
different story. Signs are likely to be plastered everywhere: utility poles, 
parkways, private property. 
</P>
<P>
"They are definitely all over the place," said Michael Gregory, a land-use 
technician for the city. 
</P>
<P>
One of the only restrictions in Huntington Beach is that the signs don't 
interfere with traffic, he said. This was evident in June when the city was 
inundated with signs from local supervisorial elections and state Assembly 
races. The clutter does spark an occasional complaint, Gregory said: "Some 
people don't like such a showy atmosphere."

The recent court decisions classifying political signs as the purest form of 
free speech have prompted many cities to ease restrictions. Some allow them in 
all public places as long as they don't create traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
In Buena Park, those pushing to have the current law revamped point to the 
constitutional questions raised by the recent cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to base my judgment on what legal counsel says," Mayor Donald L. Bone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the political hot potato is still up in the air. After several study 
sessions, the council has yet to reach a decision, and at its latest meeting, 
three council members indicated that they would vote against the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to take the matter up once again at its meeting today.

Two people were killed in La Habra early Sunday when a motorcycle slid out of 
control and crashed in the intersection of Beach and Whittier boulevards, 
police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Redmon, 21, of Rowland Heights and Yvonne Chavez, 25, of La Habra were 
fatally injured about 2:30 a.m. while going north on Beach, which terminates at 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Redmon, who was driving, apparently tried to lay his motorcycle 
down on the pavement to avoid colliding head on with dead-end barriers set up 
where Beach turns into Whittier.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE POSSESSED A SIXTH MAN'S SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to say goodby and good luck to my idea of 
a real basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to say a few words about a player who could play for me anytime, 
anywhere, skinny legs and all. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Michael Cooper, and he is leaving us. Leaving town. Leaving the 
country, even. Leaving everything but our hearts and minds. 
</P>
<P>
Some guys, you wish they'd just get up and go. When they can't cut the mustard 
the way they used to, you wish they would untie their laces and go back to 
wearing long pants. 
</P>
<P>
I never felt that way about Michael Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Even when his skills began to diminish, I never minded seeing Coop come into a 
game for the Lakers. I never wondered when the Lakers were going to get around 
to phasing him out. It was always good to see him on that basketball court. 
Always. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper can still play the game. Italy is about to find that out. 
</P>
<P>
Il Messaggero Roma, the team that once had Brian Shaw and Danny Ferry, just 
signed Coop, 34, to a two-year deal. As must be obvious by now, Il Messaggero 
is an organization that specializes in buying classy imports. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper will get by on smarts and savvy more than he will on shots or speed. He 
won't dominate the play over there, the way, say, Micheal Ray Richardson does. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred lire, though, says that a few weeks into his Il Messaggero career, 
Cooper turns out to be the brains of the outfit. He'll be a good influence, a 
good companion, a good public spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers ought to leave a blank space on their bench on opening night, in 
tribute to Coop. 
</P>
<P>
He was everything you ever wanted in a non-starter, and more. He was the 
ultimate won't-hurt-you kind of player. Won't make the dumb mistakes. Won't 
take the foolish shots. Won't let his man fake him into the folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
To me, Michael Cooper, in many ways, was a Laker to admire far more than Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, who came from the factory with more standard equipment than did 
Coop. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was the 60th player chosen in the 1978 college draft. Fifty-nine guys 
were perceived to be better NBA prospects than the dude from New Mexico with 
the cowboy's gait and the bony knees. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Mike's high collegiate effort of 26 points didn't impress everybody. 
Maybe too few people saw the potential of a player who scored points for you 
with his defense rather than with his offense. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Coop could go to the hoop. He was one of the reasons the Laker fast break 
was the prettiest thing in motion inside the Forum this side of Paula Abdul. 
</P>
<P>
With that lope of his, those lengthy strides as elegant as a harness horse's, 
Cooper seemed to cover the distance from free-throw line to free-throw line in 
about, oh, five steps. He looked like Carl Lewis, heading toward a pit of sand. 
I kept expecting Coop to hop, skip, jump and go bounding into the $8.50 seats. 
</P>
<P>
And, when it came time for one of those super-duper Cooper alley-oopers, there 
wasn't a soul in the joint who wasn't turning to the person occupying the next 
seat and giving five. 
</P>
<P>
Man, there wasn't much Mike Cooper couldn't do. He scored 31 points for the 
Lakers once, had 13 rebounds once, had 17 assists once. He might not have been 
Magic, but he was definitely Almost Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper also played in 455 consecutive games once. How's that for a stat? 
Nowadays, some of these guys sit out two weeks with busted sunglasses. Not 
Coop. He punched the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, I suppose I'll miss his Supp-Hose. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, those socks. I never did know why Cooper wore his stockings the way he did, 
high up the calves. They were the whitewalls to his wheels. Cooper wore socks 
to the knee so often, he could have enrolled in college at Vassar. 
</P>
<P>
What Pete Maravich did for floppy footwear, Michael Cooper did for leggings. 
They always looked great on that exclamation-point body of his. Made him look, 
I don't know, regal. 
</P>
<P>
What Michael Cooper did without a basketball in his hand should not be easily 
dismissed. He did endless charity work, conducted camps for kids and adults, 
sponsored a "Call Coop" help-hotline in New Mexico for teen-agers feeling 
friendless, gave hours and hours to angry, hurting young people confined to 
juvenile-detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Wanda Cooper were, as much as anybody, the First Couple of Forum 
basketball, truly pleasant people to see and know. I wish I knew them better. 
Italians are lucky. Some of them are going to get to know the Coopers better. 
</P>
<P>
For years now, Coop has been spending portions of his summers in Italy, on 
holiday and running clinics. For the next couple of years, when he takes a 
vacation, it'll be to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers won't retire his number, and shouldn't. Michael Cooper wasn't that 
sort of player. 
</P>
<P>
He was the sort of player who made life easier for everybody around him. If 
only more players could be Michael Cooper's sort of player.

CANALS OF VENICE FLOW WITH GOLD FOR U.S. SKIPPER; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: ITALIAN INDUSTRIALIST GIVES SAN FRANCISCO'S CAYARD $40 MILLION TO 
PURSUE HIS AMERICA'S CUP DREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Cayard is a San Francisco sailor whose ambition was to grow up and win the 
America's Cup, but not necessarily for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
To see Cayard's name among the challengers will be one of the anomalies at San 
Diego in 1992, along with New Zealand's Chris Dickson sailing for Japan and San 
Diego's Rod Davis possibly competing for New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago Cayard came close to fulfilling another of his ambitions -- 
to sail for the United States in the Olympics -- but finished second in the 
trials for the Star class, and the next thing anybody knew he had defected to 
Venice. Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
Cayard, 31, is the skipper and managing director of the Il Moro di Venezia 
syndicate and the envy of nearly every other sailor in the world. 
</P>
<P>
To sailors, nationality counts less than opportunity, and the high-stakes 
America's Cup game offers limited opportunities because of the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigns for '92 will cost a minimum of $15 million. So when Italian 
industrialist Raul Gardini offered Cayard the chance to put his bid together, 
at a salary reported to be $500,000 a year, Cayard had no trouble convincing 
his conscience it was the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is a much smaller place now," Cayard said by phone recently. 
"Nationalism doesn't mean as much." 
</P>
<P>
Italy, recent host of the World Cup, offers some examples. 
</P>
<P>
"The soccer teams all have players from other countries," Cayard said. "We've 
had Danny Ferry and Brian Shaw playing basketball over here." 
</P>
<P>
And soon, former Laker Michael Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the opportunity to put together my team and my program and try to win 
the America's Cup," Cayard said. "I hope that maybe someday I could have 
another opportunity to do it my way -- in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't likely soon. Even Dennis Conner has to hustle for money from 
corporate America. Others struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got the trophy that's the pinnacle of the sport and you can't 
generate much interest in your own country -- there's your patriotism," Cayard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the Il Moro di Venezia campaign is budgeted at about $40 
million. But whatever Cayard needs, Cayard gets. 
</P>
<P>
The name translates to "The Moor of Venice," alluding to a medieval hero 
idolized by Gardini. Gardini presides over the Ferruzzi worldwide group of 500 
chemical and pharmaceutical plants that recorded sales of $30 billion in 1988. 
Presumably, they haven't finished counting '89. 
</P>
<P>
Cayard insists there is a budget -- "It's very hard to run a program without 
the guidelines of a budget," he says -- but the only limit might be the supply 
of blank checks Gardini has on hand. 
</P>
<P>
At Fremantle, Western Australia, in '86-87, when Cayard was tactician for the 
late Tom Blackaller aboard the fast but underfunded USA from St. Francis Yacht 
Club, Italy sent two other syndicates after the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
They had plenty of money, too. They had the best facilities, threw the best 
parties and their crews wore the best clothes -- foul weather gear by Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
But their boats sailed like slugs, and one day they couldn't even find the 
starting line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say exactly what went wrong down there," Cayard said. "We have 
our own way of doing things here." 
</P>
<P>
American know-how, Gardini decided, was the missing link. Cayard already had 
picked up a little Italian by sailing Gardini's maxi-boat Il Moro since '85, 
and has almost fulfilled the two-year residence required of sailors who switch 
countries in the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians have had one America's Cup-class boat in the water for five months 
and launched their second in July, about the time Conner started building the 
first for any American. 
</P>
<P>
They also are the first challenger to secure a shore facility at San Diego and 
will move into Gerry Driscoll's boatyard on Shelter Island early in January. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 challengers must post a $150,000 performance bond by Sept. 3, an 
obligation expected to reduce the field, but merely a problem of petty cash for 
Cayard. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians seem to be leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else, except perhaps 
Dickson's Nippon Challenge, but there was a disquieting experience recently. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in trials against Marc Pajot's French boat, Cayard's Il 
Moro I -- with a golden lion painted on its hull -- lost three consecutive 
races. 
</P>
<P>
That reminded Cup historians of Davis' comment when he first looked upon the 
magnificent bird embracing the gray hull of Eagle, the Newport Harbor Yacht 
Club's entry at Fremantle. 
</P>
<P>
"It had better be fast," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians' New York-based publicity people insist the report from France was 
wrong, but could not say what really happened because of an agreement between 
the teams, and that Il Moro I was not meant to be fast, anyway. It's only a 
development boat, to be used as a benchmark for its successors. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Cayard also has brought aboard two other Americans: Robert Hopkins 
as design technology coordinator and Adam Ostenfeld to oversee the sailing 
systems -- deck hardware, electronics, etc. Both were with Conner in the 
successful Sail America program at Fremantle. 
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility is much more than I ever imagined," Cayard said. "The job 
is more demanding. I can see now that Blackaller was under more pressure than I 
realized, (although) he had different kinds of things to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have our own design team -- we contracted it out -- but what he had 
was the nightmare of fund-raising, which was a constant thing. He'd have to be 
at the beck and call of every guy who had a dollar to give him. 
</P>
<P>
"My load's different. We have a bigger team, more press. The press is very 
different here, too. Very aggressive. They jump on any little rumor and blow it 
up. That's kind of a pain in itself."

SAN CLEMENTE TRIATHLON; 
</P>
<P>
ROBINSON OVERCOMES OBSTACLES TO WIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Robinson should have been distracted enough not to win the San Clemente 
triathlon Sunday. After all, he had to fight uneven, strong surf on the first 
leg of the competition, and then headwinds on the bicycling leg. He didn't even 
have his own hotel room the night before the event. 
</P>
<P>
But, Robinson, 27, overcame all the obstacles to capture the triathlon and move 
into second place in the U.S. Triathlon Series standings. Mike Pigg, who did 
not compete Sunday, is the point leader, with 1,168 points, in the city-to-city 
national championship event series. Robinson has 1,125. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Robinson, who lives in Santa Rosa, finished in 1 hour 57 minutes 47 
seconds to win his first USTS triathlon of the year. Brett Rose of Tempe, 
Ariz., who lives in Laguna Beach, was second in 1:58.58. He was followed by 
Andrew Carlson of Laguna Niguel in 1:59.23 and Greg Welch of San Diego in 
2:00.21. Robinson was awarded $1,000 for first place. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente triathlon, the seventh in a series of 11, included a 
1.5-kilometer swim around the San Clemente pier, a 40K bike ride and a 10K run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the swim that gave the more than 1,800 triathletes the most problems. 
Rose came out of the water first with a 33-second lead over Carlson and with 
Robinson 1:14 back. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a really good start and hit the first buoy well," said Rose, a four-time 
All-American swimmer at Arizona State. "But I swallowed a lot of water and 
couldn't get any rhythm with those waves." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "I couldn't really feel the current, but the waves were massive. 
It was a really hard course and with the ocean waves, you couldn't see behind 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was only on the last five miles of the biking course that I could relax 
and get on pace." 
</P>
<P>
Rose came into the running transition area with a 1:18 lead over Carlson and 
Robinson. Of the three, Carlson, 23, who is in his second year of competing on 
the professional circuit, is considered the better runner. But not Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who competed in track and field and cross-country at Cornell, caught 
Carlson at 2.75 miles along the 6.2-mile route. Although Robinson had a 
600-yard lead with less than a mile left, he wasn't satisfied it was enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a deal with myself to not look back until Mile 5," Robinson said. "I 
looked back and my lead didn't look like much distance. 
</P>
<P>
"At the top of the last hill, I wasn't looking back, instead, I was pushing it 
as hard as I could. I knew if someone was coming from behind, that I couldn't 
go any faster." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson placed sixth at last year's San Clemente triathlon, although he 
wandered off course in the bicycling segment. This year, Robinson encountered 
problems before the triathlon. He couldn't get a hotel room and ended up 
sleeping on the floor of fellow triathlete Steve Fitch's room. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Steve last night that I was a world-class sleeper," Robinson said. "I 
slept great. I didn't mind because I was used to sleeping on floors when I 
didn't have any money in college." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, Joy Hansen of Newtown Square, Pa., passed defending 
champion Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas in the run to increase her lead in the 
standings. Entering the triathlon, Hansen held a 9.5 point lead over last 
year's USTS overall champion, Colleen Cannon of Nederland, Colo., who placed 
third Sunday. Hansen finished in 2:12.45. Newby-Fraser was second in 2:15.03. 
</P>
<P>
Newby-Fraser, who competed last month in an Ironman triathlon in Osaka, Japan, 
was feeling the effects of hard training and was conserving for the run. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty strong, but I felt like on the run that I haven't gotten as much 
rest as I need," said Newby-Fraser, who plans to compete in another Ironman in 
British Columbia next week. "My legs felt strong, but a little fatigued." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hansen: "I felt confident, but I know (Newby-Fraser) is a strong runner. 
She was sitting back on the bike the last 10 miles and I didn't know if she was 
tired or just biding her time." 
</P>
<P>
The USTS series ends Oct. 20 at the national championship in Las Vegas, where a 
prize purse of $175,000 will be awarded to the top 10 men and women in the 
point standings.

CAN LAGUNA BEACH COMMISSION A WORTHY SCULPTURE FOR $27,000?; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ARTWORK: THE CITY'S 1%-FOR-THE-ARTS PROJECT HAS GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT IN 
THE REAL WORLD SUCH A PALTRY SUM WILL, AT BEST, BUY A MINOR PIECE BY AN 
UNKNOWN. SO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET YOURSELF A DECENT WORK?

The city of Laguna Beach is holding a national competition for a sculpture to 
be sited at the intersection of Forest Avenue and 3rd Street -- next to City 
Hall, which is being remodeled. That sounds like good news -- so long as the 
powers that be don't succumb to a winsome dolphin or a designer cube. But the 
city is expecting to pay only $27,200 for the artist's fee, fabrication and 
installation. That's depressing. 
</P>
<P>
There's no mystery about where the figure came from. It represents 1% of the 
remodeling cost, which -- according to Municipal Code, Chapter 1.09 -- is 
required to be reserved for a work of art. The mystery is what the city's Arts 
Commission expects to get for such a paltry sum. 
</P>
<P>
All the submissions, due on Sept. 14, are to be reviewed by a preliminary 
selection committee of (to quote the prospectus) "leading participants in all 
levels of the art community." This jury is to choose five semifinalists, the 
Arts Commission is to winnow the projects down to two, and the City Council is 
to make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member selection committee, which hasn't been completely assembled yet, 
includes Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum; Maudette Ball, 
administrator of the Foothill Ranch Urban Arts Program in Saddleback Valley; 
Melinda Wortz, director of the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery; City Councilman 
Neil G. Fitzpatrick; Laguna Beach art collector Arnie Kline; and Joe Souvella, 
an instructor in the community education program of the Art Institute of 
Southern California in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When I was invited to be on the committee, I agreed. Foolishly, I didn't 
inquire about the budget. When I found out what it was, I was flabbergasted. I 
called Philip Hofmann, the staff liaison to the Arts Commission, to ask where 
the rest of the money would be coming from. He said the city had no plans to 
raise more money, unless, perhaps, "on a contingency basis." That didn't sound 
encouraging, and I decided to back out. 
</P>
<P>
So how much does it cost to get yourself a decent public sculpture? Well, of 
course, that depends on such factors as the scope of the project, the materials 
with which the piece is constructed and whether the artist is young and 
inexperienced, in "mid-career" or an established figure. But I was surprised to 
see a figure so far under $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
This particular sculpture is supposed to occupy a 188-square-foot site, 
incorporate a water element and be no taller than 20 feet. Media "may include 
but (are) not limited to metal, stone, ceramic, concrete, fiberglass and mixed 
media," according to the prospectus; any material must withstand exposure to 
sun and salt air as well as "the possibility of defacement, flood or automobile 
accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's public art program was begun in 1987, this is the first 
time a municipal building is involved and the first open competition for a work 
of art. A work of art sitting right downtown in front of City Hall will, ipso 
facto, help define the city's image, so it behooves the city to plan 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Does Laguna Beach want to continue to be seen as the home of earnestly 
behind-the-times artsy-craftsy productivity and vapid designer chic? If so, a 
three-dimensional doodad by any fledgling artist panting to get a commission 
will do just fine. But if the city is willing to entertain the idea of a major 
work -- which may very well incorporate a lighthearted point of view but in a 
sophisticated, innovative way -- then it needs major league bucks and a major 
league vision. 
</P>
<P>
In general, national competitions are difficult to pull off without a sizable 
kitty for attention-grabbing mailings and extensive advertising. (Hofmann's 
entire public relations budget is only $4,000, so he has settled for putting an 
ad in one issue of Artweek magazine and sending press releases to newspapers 
across the country.) It's often difficult for artists living at a distance to 
visit the site and get a feel for the locale, which can't be communicated in a 
dry diagram of specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Even if an artist with a striking idea chose to take no fee at all for coming 
up with the concept, heavy-duty materials and the manpower involved in 
installation are big-ticket items. To get some perspective on the cost factor, 
I spoke with several administrators who work with public art and got a range of 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
I mentioned to Mary Beebe the dollar figure of the Laguna Beach project and the 
requirement that it incorporate water. Beebe is director of the prestigious 
Stuart Collection, a public art program that has placed work by such prominent 
artists as Bruce Nauman, Robert Irwin and Terry Allen on the UC San Diego 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't build much more than a drinking fountain for ($27,000)," Beebe said. 
"If it's supposed to command the whole plaza, it's ridiculous. . . . An artist 
could lose his shirt on a good idea. Maybe it could be done, but it seems 
unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Chaplin, program manager for the Art in Public Buildings program of the 
California Arts Council, said her agency's entire annual project budget is only 
$150,000, so grants for outdoor work tend to be in the $25,000 to $30,000 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"For $27,000 you could have an emerging artist," she said. "I know a lot of 
talented (emerging) artists who could accept a commission like that. . . . If 
you're talking bronze, you don't have enough money. If you're talking stone, 
maybe you do." 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that a piece might be as simple as a "10-foot spire with water 
dripping down" or "three rocks from a quarry polished on one side with one or 
three recirculating bubblers (fountains)." 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, such pieces sound awfully bland and unimaginative. Wouldn't it be 
better to hang onto the money and organize a private fund-raising campaign to 
top off the budget to a more magnanimous size? Another source the city might 
tap is its "in lieu" fund, a pool of 1% contributions by developers who elect 
not to acquire a work of art for their property. This fund now totals $78,571. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Shamash, public art program manager for the city of Seattle -- whose 
percent-for-art program is one of the most celebrated in the nation -- points 
out that "it's the planning that's critical." It's possible, she said, "if you 
have a really good proposal," to raise more money later. "But you need somehow 
to define the budget. You need to say $27,200 is the budget or that it is only 
for the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had $20,000 for a really major project, we'd use it for planning and 
design. We'd fund the first phase and then . . . get the sponsoring (city) 
department to fabricate the work out of construction funds" representing the 
other 99% of the building project. 
</P>
<P>
Shamash said Seattle has done some projects on a shoestring. "I don't think you 
need $100,000 to do a great project," she added. "It depends a lot on the 
design. If it's an interesting enough project" -- such as one in which teams of 
artists get to collaborate with design professionals -- good artists will be 
interested in competing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, there is nothing particularly sexy about the Laguna Beach 
project. Even the requirement that the piece contain a water element -- a 
redundant component for a piece just a few blocks from the ocean, anyway -- 
sounds like more of a limitation than a challenge. It sounds, frankly, as 
though the city was envisioning a demure pool or fountain that would simply 
reinforce the kitsch status of a tourist town's art. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Brea -- dotted with poorly sited, bland and hackneyed works of art 
that are ludicrously out of scale with the environment and crafted by artistic 
nonentities -- has already shown Orange County how not to conduct a 
percent-for-art program. Is it too much to hope that Laguna Beach might try for 
something really first-class, environmentally appropriate and delightfully 
unconventional?

Public officials broke ground today for the first new park in the 
Sunland-Tujunga area in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Finn Park, named for the late City Councilman Howard Finn, is to open in 
February in what is now a dusty lot behind the Sunland-Tujunga community 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-acre, city-owned parcel is overgrown with weeds and was often used as an 
illegal trash dump. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a day we've been waiting for for a long time," said City Councilman 
Joel Wachs, one of several officials who dug into the soft dirt with 
gold-painted shovels. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Kathleen Chan said the park will include a children's play area 
and a sand volleyball court, as well as picnic tables and barbecue facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the creation of a community garden later.

3 NORTHWEST PILOTS FLEW 'HIGH' -- JURY;

TRANSPORTATION: THE CONVICTIONS ARE THE FIRST UNDER A TOUGH FEDERAL 
ANTI-DRINKING AND DRUG LAW.

<P>
Three former Northwest Airlines pilots were found guilty today of flying while 
intoxicated, the first convictions under a new federal law cracking down on 
drinking and drug use in commercial transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury convicted former pilots Norman Lyle Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; 
Robert Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and Joseph Balzer, 35, of 
Antioch, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The felony charge carries a maximum 15 years in prison and $250,000 fine. 
Sentencing will not be decided until authorities complete a pre-sentencing 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into this expecting the worst. In that sense I had no surprise," said 
Prouse after the verdicts were announced. In his defense, he had argued that he 
was an alcoholic and thus had a higher tolerance for alcohol than most people. 
His lawyer said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested March 8 after flying a Boeing 727 from Fargo, N.D., to 
the Twin Cities. The plane, carrying 91 passengers, landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they had consumed numerous drinks at a bar several hours before 
the early morning flight. 
</P>
<P>
In tests about two hours after the plane arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport, Kirchner showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06%, 
Balzer showed 0.08% and Prouse 0.13%. 
</P>
<P>
Prouse was the captain on the flight, Kirchner the first officer and Balzer the 
flight engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots had been drinking the night before at a lounge in Moorhead and a 
customer reported them to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
According to bills from the bar introduced as evidence, Prouse ordered 15 rum 
and colas while Kirchner and Balzer shared seven pitchers of beer over about 
six hours. 
</P>
<P>
An FAA official came to the airport, but the plane left while he was 
telephoning a supervisor to ask what to do. Another FAA official made a 
citizen's arrest when the plane landed at Minneapolis-St. Paul International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers argued that the apparently smooth operation of the 40-minute 
flight showed that the pilots were not impaired by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Elizabeth de la Vega questioned whether the pilots 
could have handled an emergency if one had developed.

<P>
There was no sign of robbery or forced entry at the Super Shops store at the

The bodies were found about 9 a.m. by an unidentified day manager in a storage

in front of them and that they appeared to have been shot at close range in the 
head with a handgun. 
</P>

BUSH: FREE OUR HOSTAGES;

IRAQ SEIZES ANOTHER 12 AMERICANS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush demanded today that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq 
and Kuwait, saying "whatever these innocent people are called, they are in fact 
hostages." 
</P>
<P>
He said a regime that uses civilians as pawns will face the scorn and 
condemnation of the entire civilized world. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke -- for the first time describing the foreigners held by the Iraqi 
regime of Saddam Hussein as hostages -- the official Iraqi News Agency said 
that, as promised, some Westerners have been moved to military targets 
scattered throughout Iraq for use as shields to ward off aerial attacks from 
American planes and missiles in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the State Department said at least 12 Americans, along with 
a number of other foreign nationals, had been taken from hotels in Kuwait's 
capital and moved to undisclosed locations. Protests were lodged by U.S. 
diplomats in Kuwait and Iraq, but the whereabouts of the Americans remained 
unknown, spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities warned their own people about harboring foreigners, saying 
anyone doing so faced the "severest punishment." A radio report said the rule 
applied to Iraq's "entire administrative border," apparently including Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on a trip to the Persian Gulf region, announced 
earlier in the day that the United Arab Emirates had agreed to allow U.S. C-130 
cargo transports to operate out of the moderate Arab federation. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who made the announcement along with the president of the Emirates, 
Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, was traveling later in the day to Oman and 
Saudi Arabia to discuss the U.S. military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Hussein's government informed diplomats they had until Friday to 
close their missions in Kuwait or lose their special status. 
</P>
<P>
Several countries said they had no plans to close their embassies. They 
included Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the 
Soviet Union and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not discuss those developments in his speech to the national 
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
He again compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler and Hussein's takeover of Kuwait to 
Hitler's aggression against neighbors in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"A half-century ago, the world had the chance of stopping a ruthless aggressor 
-- and missed it," Bush said, "and I pledge to you, we will not make that 
mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
Later, aboard his plane on a flight to a Republican fund-raising event in Rhode 
Island, Bush was asked if his use of the term hostages to describe the interned 
Westerners was an escalation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any turning up the heat," he told reporters. "It's a 
recognition of the fact that now demands are being made for the release of 
people and that, I think, is the definition of hostages." 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 Americans and thousands of other foreign citizens are under Iraqi 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the demand that Hussein release the Americans and others, Bush offered 
no details about how he would gain their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that "America will not be intimidated" and will stand against 
aggression.

TRAINS COLLIDE IN FOG NEAR WARSAW; 16 KILLED

A high-speed train plowed into the back of a slow-moving train in thick fog on 
the outskirts of Warsaw today, killing 16 people and injuring more than 50, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The force of the collision lifted the last car of the slower train off the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
The engine of the speeding train ripped through the car as it passed 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a macabre sight with the coach standing up, and there was no floor," 
said a fire brigade worker who was among the first to arrive at the scene after 
the 6:20 a.m. crash. 
</P>
<P>
The train was en route from Prague to Warsaw and was moving about 60 m.p.h. 
when it hit the second train, which was traveling about 9 m.p.h. as it arrived 
from Szklarska Poreba in southwestern Poland, the Polish Railroad said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Emergency workers at the 
scene suggested the engineer of the Prague train may not have seen the signal 
that caused the first train to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three of the injured were hospitalized, the official PAP news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the victims appeared to be on the slower train. One of them, 
Bogdan Owsiak, told Polish television that most aboard were sleeping when the 
train was hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I managed to squeeze out through a crack, and only when I fell to the ground 
did I see one of my legs was broken and I had an open wound," Owsiak said. 
"While we were waiting for ambulances we could hear people crying inside the 
train." 
</P>
<P>
An American Embassy official at the scene said it did not appear there were any 
Americans among the dead or injured.

A large jump in the number of people eligible for food stamps and welfare 
benefits this year is costing states and the federal government billions of 
dollars, a published report said today. 
</P>
<P>
At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, with some rising up 
to 50%, according to an Agriculture Department report quoted in The New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people receiving food stamps rose by 1.3 million from May, 1989, 
to May, 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first time since 1985, found a 
report submitted to Congress by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
The department, which administers the food stamp program, noted that food stamp 
rolls have risen 16% in the last year in Texas, 19% in Florida, 26% in Nevada, 
54% in New Hampshire, 12% each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7% each in New 
York State and California, and 21% in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Congress appropriated $14.8 billion, but that proved inadequate and it had to 
provide an additional $1.2 billion in May. It then directed the Agriculture 
Department to investigate the causes.

<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said he will not replace Meckel but will 
himself assume the duties of the nation's senior diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Meckel stepped down after his party, the Social Democrats, voted Sunday to 
leave De Maiziere's foundering governing coalition. He was the fifth minister 
to leave the government in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The huge fissures in the nation's first freely elected government plunged it 
deeper into a crisis fueled by economic problems and ferocious battles among 
parties seeking to win elections for a united German government. 
</P>
<P>
The political infighting has increasingly appalled a populace preoccupied with 
rising food and fuel prices and skyrocketing joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know what both parties want," said Thomas Wollenburg as he and 
his wife, Andrea, pushed their two young children in strollers to an 
unemployment office in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Wollenburg said he was among 50 workers laid off from his construction firm two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both the conservative Christian Democrats of De Maiziere and of West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the left-leaning Social Democrats in both German 
states, accuse each other of using East Germany's economic problems for 
political gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats voted to leave the coalition Sunday after De Maiziere 
fired four Cabinet members last week, including the agriculture, finance and 
economics ministers. The party contended that De Maiziere unilaterally fired 
the ministers to protect his own party's political fortunes in the face of the 
economic problems.

SPLINTER IN TOE BECOMES $3,700 THORN IN FLORIDA MAN'S SIDE

The next time Jack McElhinney gets a splinter, he plans to take care of it 
himself. The last one has cost more than $3,700 to remove. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old retired real estate broker had pulled most of the splinter out 
of his big toe and was able to jog and play tennis, but the sliver annoyed him. 
</P>
<P>
He went to his doctor, who X-rayed the toe and referred him to a surgeon, who 
sent him to another physician. When the toe became infected, the doctor said 
McElhinney would have to go to the hospital to get the splinter removed. 
</P>
<P>
McElhinney thought it would be a simple procedure. Then a clerk called and 
asked whether he had a will and had signed an organ donor card. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, that's the point at which I should have realized things had 
gotten out of control," McElhinney told the Tampa Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent tests and the surgery was done under local anesthesia May 31. The 
splinter -- about half an inch long and extremely thin -- was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital bill was $3,177.11. The pathologists asked for $197.35. The 
anesthesiologists billed him $400. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even gotten the surgeon's bill yet. They'll probably deliver that in 
a Brink's truck," McElhinney said. 
</P>
<P>
His insurer paid $1,906.27 of the $3,177.11 bill. He is supposed to pay $476, 
and the rest will be waived. 
</P>
<P>
McElhinney said he and his neighbors have a solution for the next splinter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've invested in a fancy first-aid kit," he said. "We'll do the surgery 
ourselves."

YEUTTER OPTIMISTIC THAT JAPAN WILL END BAN ON RICE IMPORTS

<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter today gave his Japanese 
counterpart two bags of California rice and expressed optimism that Japan will 
act this year to end its ban on imports of the grain. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's refusal to open its rice market is one of the stickiest trade disputes 
between the two economic superpowers, and Yeutter received no promises today. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter presented Tomio Yamamoto, the agriculture minister, with four pounds of 
medium-grain California rice at the beginning of their talks. Yamamoto accepted 
the rice with a smile and a word of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter later told a news conference that Japan could provide a great boost to 
multilateral negotiations to liberalize international trade by acting quickly 
to open its rice market to imports. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year negotiations, under the auspices of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, end in December. U.S. officials believe that exemptions 
requested by individual nations for certain products such as rice reduce the 
chances for overall success. 
</P>
<P>
"I am cautiously optimistic that reason and good judgment will prevail in Japan 
and that this nation will do its part" in the trade talks, Yeutter said at the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan is the world's largest food importer, the government has 
insisted on maintaining self-sufficiency in rice, its staple food, which sells 
for several times the world market price. Only a limited quantity of imported 
rice is allowed for use in processed food. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto told Yeutter that rice "is more than an issue of concern to Japan. It 
is a matter of life and death to us," Kyodo News Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter stressed that he envisioned Japan opening its rice market only 
gradually. He said U.S. policy is to support the conversion of all import 
restrictions to tariffs, which would then be lowered over time.

China's central bank announced today it will cut interest rates on loans and 
deposits beginning Tuesday to try to stimulate a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, said by a People's Bank of China spokesman to average 1.08 
percentage points, was the second drop in the cost of borrowing this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rates fell by an average of 1.26 percentage points in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of interest rates will help reduce the burden on enterprises, 
reduce costs and stimulate the market," the official New China News Agency 
quoted the spokesman as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Actual rates were not published. Economists said they ranged widely, from about 
7% for short-term deposits up to about 10%. Loans are generally slightly 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is showing "a favorable trend" but markets are slack, stockpiles of 
unsold products are large and industrial efficiency is still low, the spokesman 
said.

K mart Corp., one of the nation's largest retailing companies, said today that 
its profits edged up 2% in the second fiscal quarter ended Aug. 1 as a result 
of stronger apparel sales and cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter earnings of $148 million, or 74 cents a share, were up from $145 
million, 72 cents a share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues climbed 11%, to $7.88 billion from $7.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Expense controls and higher sales offset negative factors such as a relatively 
weak retail environment, higher interest expenses and a reduction in gross 
profit margins, K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said. 
</P>
<P>
To boost sales, K mart launched a strategy to lower everyday shelf prices, 
leading to lower profit margins.

IRONS SYMPATHETIC TO VON BULOW

A movie about Claus von Bulow won't reveal whether the Danish socialite lawyer 
tried to kill his heiress wife, Sunny, but that hasn't stopped the actor who 
played von Bulow from sympathizing with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Acting a part is like a detective story. 
</P>
<P>
You're following clues. I've just got this gut feeling about many of the things 
von Bulow did. Finally you work out a hypothesis and all the clues just drop 
in. And you think: That's it," said actor Jeremy Irons. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, "Reversal of Fortune," is based on the book by von Bulow's appeal 
lawyer, Alan Dershowitz. Von Bulow's 1982 conviction in Rhode Island on two 
counts of assault with intent to kill his wife with an injection of insulin was 
overturned after an appeal and second trial in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Claus is actually much more a victim of that trial than Sunny," Irons 
told Fame magazine in its September issue. "They claim Sunny was the victim and 
that her life was opened up for public scrutiny. Well, so was Claus von 
Bulow's, and he's alive. Sunny, at least, is in a coma." 
</P>
<P>
Irons said the film, co-starring Glenn Close, would keep people arguing about 
von Bulow's guilt or innocence.

BOB ARTHUR TO LEAVE KABC'S 'KEN AND BOB'; BARKLEY WILL JOIN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Arthur, the quieter co-host of KABC-AM's "The Ken and Bob Company," one of 
the most popular radio programs in Los Angeles, announced today that he will 
leave the station next month to help set up a controversial group of care homes 
for Alzheimer's disease patients in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur, who will broadcast his last show with Ken Minyard on Sept. 14, will be 
replaced by another local radio veteran, Roger Barkley. Barkley co-hosted the 
popular "Lohman and Barkley" show on KFI-AM (640) for 25 years, then served as 
morning host for KJOI-FM until last year. He filled in for Arthur twice this 
year when Arthur was ill. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ken and Barkley Company" will premiere on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Arthur, 69, will break up his longtime partnership with 
Minyard, the other co-host on the news/entertainment program. The duo have been 
together on KABC (790) for 17 years and have been among the top three in the 
morning ratings since the "Ken and Bob Company" premiered in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur told listeners of his decision during this morning's program. Barkley 
also appeared on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur said he had a "financial and moral" interest in setting up the care 
homes, which he said are being opposed by several residents and city officials 
who fear the homes will lower property values. The seven single-family 
facilities are being coordinated under the auspices of Rose Chateau Inc., in 
which Arthur has a part interest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a long and agonizing decision because I've got a good career 
going," Arthur said in an interview. "But I can't use the airwaves of KABC to 
fight this battle because it would be a conflict of interest." He said the 
project would require his "complete attention." 
</P>
<P>
Minyard, 51, said he regretted Arthur's decision, but understood it. "When 
you've been together for so long, it's never nice when something like this 
ends," Minyard said. "But I understand it. Bob has a real commitment to this, 
and this is something he feels he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
KABC President and General Manager George Green said: "Bob is an integral part 
of this radio station. By the same token, when you have a guy with the name and 
reputation of Roger Barkley, someone who is a household name, you're thankful 
to get a guy of that caliber."

Jazz and blues singer Pearl Bailey will be buried in Philadelphia, where she 
spent much of her early career, her road manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her husband felt it was best since her family is here and she was raised up in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
That's why we're having it here," said E. B. Smith, Bailey's manager for 23 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at the Deliverence 
Evangelistic Church in Philadelphia, followed by burial at the Rolling Green 
Memorial Park, where Bailey's mother and brother are buried. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that it would be a "regular, plain funeral" but that people from as 
far away as California had already booked their flights to Philadelphia. He 
said he did not know how many people would turn out to say goodby to "Pearlie 
Mae." 
</P>
<P>
Song-and-dance man Cab Calloway had asked to be one of the six pallbearers, 
Smith said. And at least three of her managers, including Smith, also planned 
to help carry the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who at 72 had a history of heart trouble, collapsed Friday night at a 
Holiday Inn in Philadelphia's historic district, where she was recuperating 
from knee surgery performed last month.

WRAPS OFF, 'EXORCIST III' TOPS THE WEEKEND GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Exorcist III," which distributor 20th Century Fox kept from the hands of 
critics by not scheduling any screenings before Friday's opening, wound up 
topping the national box office statistics for the weekend, according to 
preliminary estimates from industry sources today. 
</P>
<P>
The third installment of the supernatural thriller series, that began with 
director William Friedkin's enormously popular "The Exorcist" in 1973, summoned 
up a healthy $9.3 million at 1,288 screens over the Friday-Saturday-Sunday 
period. 
</P>
<P>
But following hot on its heels was Paramount's durable summer hit, "Ghost," 
placing second for the second week in a row and closing in rapidly on the 
$100-million box office mark. The Whoopi Goldberg comedy brought in about $8.5 
million in 1,766 theaters over the weekend, bringing its cumulative 38-day 
total to $99.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century Fox's strategy of opening "Exorcist III" without advance 
screenings was duplicated by Warner Bros., which similarly opened its Steve 
Martin-Rick Moranis comedy, "My Blue Heaven," in a way to reduce the chance of 
critical notice before the weekend. The ploy is widely seen within the film 
industry as a way of avoiding negative reviews, thus permitting a film at least 
one weekend to ride on its own publicity at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
The technique didn't work quite that way, however, for "My Blue Heaven." The 
early figures show the film came in a disappointing fourth with $6.4 million on 
1,859 screens. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in third place for the weekend was Columbia's "Flatliners," which 
led the previous week's list, with about $7.5 million on 1,766 screens. The 
sci-fi adventure story about near-death experiences, starring Julia Roberts, 
Kevin Bacon and Keiffer Sutherland, did $10 million in business during its 
first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.' "Presumed Innocent" continued strong in fifth place with 
approximately $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," which generated much advance publicity and won 
the top prize at last May's Cannes Film Festival, came in at 10th place with an 
estimated $2.7 million in a much smaller release at 523 screens. The film stars 
Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage. 
</P>
<P>
The much-anticipated sequel to "Chinatown," Jack Nicholson's "The Two Jakes," 
dropped off the top 10 list in only its second week. In its first weekend, the 
film did a languid $3.7 million on 1,206 screens for a seventh-place finish, 
while the weekend just-ended saw it take in only about $1.8 million.

Principal photography on "The Fisher King," starring Robin Williams and Jeff

months. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fisher King" is billed as a dramatic comedy about one man's attempt to 
redeem himself from a life of fatal cynicism through his allegiance with a 
visionary street person. 
</P>
<P>
Williams will be seen as a professor of medieval history who has retreated into 
a world of his own creation to isolate himself from his past. Bridges plays a

Tammy Bakker hopes visitors to Disney World will join her new flock at an 
industrial complex nearby after going on the rides at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of imprisoned TV preacher Jim Bakker held her first service at the 
industrial site Sunday after winning a zoning battle with the help of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakkers' fall from grace and her husband's fraud conviction for bilking 
followers of his PTL ministry made Mrs. Bakker pessimistic about the zoning 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock when we finally won it," she told about 60 worshipers Sunday. 
"I guess I've kind of gotten used to accepting defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Commission had banned religious services at the industrial 
park where her ministry has its TV recording studios. ACLU attorneys argued 
that the ban was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bakker said she may hold services on Friday evenings to attract visitors 
leaving Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband is serving a 45-year term in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakkers set up an Orlando-based cable TV ministry before his conviction 
last year.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HOOF MOISTURIZERS JOIN UDDER CREAMS AS BEAUTY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: I've been amused by your columns about people using udder creams as 
elegant beauty aids. I run a feed and garden store, and many of our female 
customers love these products. We always keep them in stock because the demand 
is so great. 
</P>
<P>
Were you aware that hoof moisturizers are also becoming popular? The horsewomen 
in our area discovered that when they used their hands to apply such products 
to their horses' hoofs, their own fingernails seemed harder and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
We sell both Purina Hoof Moisturizer and Hoof Maker from Straight Arrow Co. 
About 80% of our sales are to women who don't usually shop in a feed store. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Special thanks to Jack Haire and Glen Grant of Willowbrook Feed &amp; 
Garden for alerting us to the popularity of hoof moisturizers for strengthening 
human nails. We have no data to back up the claim that such animal "cosmetics" 
are helpful for people. Ingredients like lanolin, beeswax, mineral oil and 
coconut oil certainly should help brittle, dry nails, however. 
</P>
<P>
For our readers who don't have access to agricultural supply stores, the Purina 
customer service number is (800) 227-8941. The Straight Arrow Co. can be 
contacted at (800) 827-9815.

Q. How safe is niacin to lower cholesterol? My son-in-law couldn't seem to get 
his triglycerides and cholesterol under control until he started taking niacin 
in large doses. 
</P>
<P>
When I tried it, niacin made me extremely uncomfortable. The flush and prickly 
feeling is almost unbearable. He claims he doesn't experience any side effects 
from his niacin. 
</P>
<P>
A. Some people are more susceptible to the niacin flush than others. Taking the 
supplement at meals may help reduce the discomfort. Some doctors also recommend 
an aspirin half an hour before taking niacin. 
</P>
<P>
But the chances are that your son-in-law is taking a timed-release pill. 
Although such formulas are far less likely to cause the niacin flush, there are 
growing concerns that these products may be more toxic to the liver than 
regular crystalline niacin. 
</P>
<P>
Niacin is definitely not appropriate for do-it-yourself cholesterol control. 
Consult with your doctor.

Country music singer Ricky Van Shelton says he was so driven to succeed that he 
didn't have enough fun -- even when success finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
His debut album in 1987 vaulted him to big-time attraction, but years of 
business pressures made the struggle to the top tough, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what made me not have a good time with it," Shelton said recently. "I'm 
beginning to really have fun with it now." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton, 38, is a finalist in three categories of Country Music Assn. Awards 
announced last week and is the reigning CMA Male Vocalist of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
His No. 1 hits include "Somebody Lied" and "From a Jack to a King."

STEINBRENNER DISPUTE ARGUED BEFORE JUDGE;

Lawyers making a last-gasp effort to keep George Steinbrenner in control of the 
New York Yankees had an economics professor and a marketing expert testify in 
U.S. District Court today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Alice M. Batchelder refused to let Steinbrenner's lawyer 
testify about the agreement that was scheduled to force out the Boss as the 
team's general partner by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication by midafternoon whether the judge would issue a 
temporary restraining order that would continue his 17 1/2-year reign. Under 
the terms of his July 30 deal with Commissioner Fay Vincent, Steinbrenner had 
until 5 p.m. EDT to deliver his resignation as managing general partner to the 
commissioner's office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder originally wanted to hear Steinbrenner's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been advised by counsel for plaintiffs as well as counsel for the 
defendants . . . they are in accord that the testimony of Mr. Steinbrenner 
himself is not necessary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Banker, Steinbrenner's lawyer, was sworn in as a witness for the 
limited partners. But Batchelder, after an objection by Vincent's lawyer, 
refused to let Banker testify, citing his testimony as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball lawyers referred to the precedent of former Oakland owner Charles O. 
Finley's failed lawsuit against former commissioner Bowie Kuhn and called on 
the judge to once again uphold the authority of the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big boy," baseball lawyer Patrick McCartan said of Steinbrenner. "He 
signed a contract with the commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Yankees part owners Daniel R. McCarthy and Harold M. Bowman, both of Cleveland, 
filed the suit last Thursday. They claimed their rights as limited partners 
were damaged by the agreement Steinbrenner and Vincent signed. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent was prepared to suspend Steinbrenner for two years as a result of his 
relationship with gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner, instead, opted to give up 
control of the team 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner was "trying to put the best face on a horrible situation when he 
signed the agreement," said Mark B. Cohn, the lawyer for McCarthy and Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
McCartan argued that the limited partners should not be allowed to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no right to challenge. They have no standing," McCartan said. "A 
third party has no right to assert the rights of another person." 
</P>
<P>
John Burke, an economics professor at Cleveland State, testified for the 
partners about Yankees' attendance. John Minco, a marketing expert, testified 
about Steinbrenner's value as a high-profile owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's one of the few owners able to get on city-side of pages, even the 
gossip columns," Minco said. "I don't know another owner who can get Nelson 
Mandela wearing a Yankees jacket and saying, 'Tonight I am a Yankee."'

American Mike McCarthy won the individual pursuit on the opening day of the 
World Cycling Championship and Michael Hubner of East Germany set a world 
record in the professional indoor sprint.

Israeli environmentalists won a Supreme Court injunction today barring the U.S. 
Voice of America from building a radio transmitter complex in the Negev Desert 
until environmental questions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Nature Protection Society and residents of the Arava Valley 
appealed to the court to block the project, saying a 43-aerial complex would 
harm the environment and disorient millions of migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
A government planning board approved the billion-dollar project last month and 
the U.S. Embassy said it hoped the transmitter would be built immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The transmitter would broadcast programs of the VOA and Radio Liberty, both 
funded by the U.S. government, in 28 languages to Eastern Europe, Central Asia 
and Africa.

<P>
When you are only 14 years old, can consistently drive a golf ball 265 yards 
and shoot a seven-under-par 63, the whole world is your golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Woods, who rarely answers to his first name of Eldrick, can do all that 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
Woods has been one of the most precocious golfers in the world since the day 
when he was not yet 3 years old and he shot a 48 on the old back nine of the 
Navy Golf Course in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"I teed the ball up for him on all his shots, but he holed out every putt," his 
father Earl recalls proudly. 
</P>
<P>
This earned Tiger a personal appearance on the Mike Douglas Show, where he 
demonstrated his swing and took part in a putting contest with Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember anything that happened, except that I was there," Tiger said 
while discussing his remarkable career surrounded by trophies in the living 
room of the Woods' home in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
When you're only 14, 12 years ago is a long time to remember. 
</P>
<P>
The Legend of the Tiger has grown faster than he has. Woods stands 5-feet-9 and 
weighs 120 pounds, but that was big enough to enable him to hit a 310-yard 
drive during a long-driving contest last week in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been long (off the tee)," he said matter-of-factly. "I get lots of 
leverage, I have flat muscles like a fighter. In a few years, when I fill out, 
I expect to average 300 yards and hit it like Greg Norman." 
</P>
<P>
He has always enjoyed hitting the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
When Tiger was 10, barely 4-9 and weighing 81 pounds, he had already won two 
Junior World 10-and-under championships in San Diego. But he didn't enjoy 
having to play on the short Presidio Hills course, where the longest hole is 
110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go to a big course, where I can hit some woods," he said after finishing 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who won't be 15 until Dec. 30, plays to a plus-two handicap at the Navy 
course, which means that his average score is a two-under-par 70 from the back 
tees on the 6,820-yard course. The course has a rating of 73.5 and a slope of 
129, largely because water comes into play on 14 of the 18 holes.

"What Tiger has done is remarkable, truly remarkable," said Dave Smith, head 
pro at the course. "What sets him apart is his mental approach to the game. I 
have been a PGA professional for 13 years, almost as long as he has been alive, 
and he knows more about the game of golf than I do. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never known anyone who was so naturally adaptable mentally to the game 
as Tiger. He had all the knowledge to play golf when he was much younger. All 
he needed was to grow a little taller, and now he's done that." 
</P>
<P>
Woods learned the game from his father, a low-handicap golfer who was the first 
black to play baseball in the Big Seven (now the Big Eight) Conference. Earl 
Woods was a catcher at Kansas State in the early 1950s. After a brief 
professional career was cut short by a shoulder injury, the elder Woods joined 
the Army and became a lieutenant colonel with the Green Berets special forces. 
He served in Europe, Asia and Vietnam before retiring after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger got his nickname from a war buddy of his father who was missing in 
action. Eldrick was born in Long Beach in 1975, but Earl called him Tiger from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
When he was still in a highchair, Tiger sat and watched his father hit golf 
balls into a net in the family garage. One day, armed with a cut-down putter, 
Tiger toddled to the mat in the garage and emulated his father's swing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was uncanny," Earl recalls. "He set up over the ball exactly the way I did, 
waggled the club, looked at the target, waggled again, and then swung. It was 
like looking at myself in a miniature mirror." 
</P>
<P>
Tiger calls it "simulating his swing through visualization." 
</P>
<P>
At age 1, Tiger made his first appearance at the Navy course, at 2 he shot his 
48 for nine holes, at 3 he was a regular on the driving range and won a Pitch, 
Putt and Drive contest against 10- and 11-year-olds, at 5 he played in his 
first junior tournament and at 8 won his first Junior World championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning that first tournament, the way I won it, is still my biggest thrill in 
golf," Tiger said. "I was out of it, but I shot five-under-par (51) to win it 
at Presidio Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Woods has since won four more Junior World championships -- more than any other 
player in the tournament's history -- and has three more years to try for six, 
seven and eight. The five Junior World trophies occupy a place of honor in the 
entryway of his home. 
</P>
<P>
When he won this year, Woods bettered the mark of four victories he shared with 
Sharon Barrett, who won hers in the late 1970s. He won the 10-and-under in 1984 
and 1985 and finished second in 1986. Moving up to the 11-12 class in 1987, he 
finished ninth, but then won in 1988 and, after advancing to the 13-14 class, 
he won that the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Woods shot 68-69-67 -- 204 on the par-71 Mission Trails course to equal the 
tournament record set by Jonathan Baker in 1981 at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I told everybody I was going to win it (Junior World) this year," he said. "I 
felt really confident. I never had any doubts. I won by five, but it wasn't 
that easy. I was only one ahead with about nine to play, but I was playing 
really good." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his father, Tiger credits professionals Rudy Duran and John 
Anselmo for helping in his development. Duran, now at Chalk Mountain in 
Atascadero, was Tiger's coach at Heartwell Park in Long Beach until he was 10. 
Anselmo is a teaching pro at the Meadowlark course in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, they worked with my swing, keeping me under control," Tiger said with 
a smile. "Most young players tend to overswing and I was no different, but they 
taught me the golden rule -- to maintain balance and swing within myself. If 
you swing 20 times harder than Greg Norman, it won't do a bit of good unless 
you maintain your balance." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Woods, 58, who retired after 20 years in the army and 10 more with 
McDonnell Douglas, has spent most of this summer chaperoning Tiger to and from 
junior tournaments. They have been in France, Texas and Oregon, as well as all 
over California, and are now headed for Florida, where Tiger will be playing 
this week in the National PGA Junior championships at Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Woods shot his best round, a 63, to win the La Mirada city junior title the day 
before he left for Ft. Worth, where he won the Big I tournament against juniors 
17 and under at the Ridgeles course. Woods, who finished second last year, shot 
70-73-69-74 -- 286 to win by three shots. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who represents Industry Hills in tournaments, also won overall in the 
Los Angeles City juniors, the Gary Walde Memorial at Industry Hills, the 
Southern California four-ball with Eddy Lee of Corona, was a member of the 
winning team in the Junior America's Cup matches at Yorba Linda, and was 
captain of the Southern California team that played in France. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at Portland, Ore., he shot a 72 to finish at 145 and help the Southern 
California team win the Hogan Cup matches with a 36-hole total of 444. San 
Diego was second at 450. 
</P>
<P>
"Tiger had to struggle in Paris because he was matched against much older 
players, but he won one individual match and another team match," said Jerry 
Herrera, the Azusa Greens head pro who arranged the international contest. "I 
would say without hesitation that Tiger has more talent than any other 
14-year-old in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In his first try at the U.S. Junior championship, which is for boys 17 and 
under, Woods lost in the semifinals. The only other events he lost this summer 
were the Lee Hamill Memorial at Los Coyotes, where he finished second to Lee, 
the Southern Section high school champion, and the California Country Club 
father-and-son tournament, where he and his father lost to Kemp and Scott 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd won the father-and-son three or four times, so we were about due to 
lose," Tiger said. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Orangeview Junior High in Anaheim with a near straight-A 
average and will enter Anaheim Western High next month. 
</P>
<P>
"School comes first, golf second," he said. "How much practice I do in golf is 
determined by how soon I finish my homework. You can't accomplish anything 
without an education. I definitely plan to finish college before thinking about 
turning professional." 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, Woods is a throwback to Ben Hogan in that he would rather 
practice than play. 
</P>
<P>
"I like practicing more because that's where I can experiment with different 
types of shots," Tiger said. "When you're in a tournament, you can't 
experiment, you have to stick with what you know. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, on the practice tee, I'm working on hitting from my knees. I've 
already mastered the high hook and the low hook and the high slice and the low 
slice and left-handed shots for when the ball is up against a fence or 
something. I want to learn to hit from my knees because sometimes the ball is 
under a tree or a bush and that's all the swing you have." 
</P>
<P>
At home, when the homework is done, Tiger even practices in the living room -- 
not with his putter but with his wedge. 
</P>
<P>
"I chip over that big chair and make the ball stop before it hits the bricks 
(in front of the fireplace). It takes a lot of concentration, because there's a 
lot of pressure on me when I try that shot. If I miss, my mother will get after 
me, but it's good training for finesse and getting the right feel for delicate 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Then, if he feels like hitting some full shots, he can go out to the garage and 
hit into the net -- right where he hit his first balls nearly 14 years ago. The 
net is still up. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Woods appears to have a bright future, but not a single black 
professional golfer has contacted him to offer encouragement, assistance or 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they've never heard of me," Woods said.

<TEXT>
<P>
B. F. Skinner, one of the most influential and controversial psychologists of 
the 20th Century, died Saturday of leukemia at a hospital near his home in 
Cambridge, Mass. He was 86 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of modern behaviorists, Burrhus Frederic Skinner -- Fred to his 
friends -- had his final paper, a defense of his behavioral theories, presented 
this month in Boston to a convention of 20,000 psychologists from around the 
world. He argued to the end that behavior is determined by an individual's 
surroundings and there is little or no "free will." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm writing a paper which is my summing up of what psychology is all about and 
attacking cognitive psychologists," Skinner told the Associated Press shortly 
before the convention. "The cognitive psychologists won't like it, but that 
doesn't bother me at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be dead in a few months," he added with a laugh. "But it hasn't given 
me the slightest anxiety or worry or anything; I always knew I was going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
Among the public at large, B. F. Skinner was perhaps less famous as one of the 
great names in psychology than as the man who taught pigeons to play table 
tennis and guide missiles -- practical applications of his conditioning 
theories -- and as the inventor of a mechanical baby tender in which his own 
daughter lived for 2 1/2 years and of the Skinner Box used in behavioral 
research. He was the author of both fiction and nonfiction in which he 
expounded his controversial views in clear and forceful prose. 
</P>
<P>
Of some 16 books bearing Skinner's name, including a three-volume 
autobiography, perhaps the two best known were his utopian novel, "Walden Two," 
and "Beyond Freedom and Dignity," a nonfiction best seller in which he 
advocated forsaking individual freedom and dignity in favor of controlling 
human behavior to achieve a world free of war, pollution and other social 
evils. 
</P>
<P>
He also pioneered teaching machines, demonstrating his first in 1954, and 
programmed learning. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, professor emeritus of psychology and social relations at Harvard, 
fathered the experimental analysis of behavior in which an organism's behavior 
was studied in a controlled laboratory environment. 
</P>
<P>
In his theory of operant conditioning, Skinner held that behavior could be 
controlled by the skillful, systematic use of rewards -- or positive 
reinforcers -- to encourage desired responses. In other words, the environment 
could be manipulated to produce desirable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner formulated his theories after studying rats and pigeons, but he 
maintained that these laws of behavior applied to all organisms, including man. 
Nor did he hesitate to extend these theories to other areas, including 
linguistics in "Verbal Behavior" (1957), teaching in "The Technology of 
Teaching" (1968) and finally to culture in "Beyond Freedom and Dignity" (1971). 
</P>
<P>
His rejection of free will and his advocacy of behavioral engineering outraged 
religious leaders and others both within psychology and without. His critics 
were not mollified by his observation: "The organism whose behavior I observed 
most closely was myself." 
</P>
<P>
He was dismissed by his critics, who included Arthur Koestler and Joseph Wood 
Krutch, as a "rat psychologist" or, worse, a totalitarian. Skinner, one critic 
said, confused people and pigeons. Krutch accused Skinner of dehumanizing 
people by "conditioning them into perfect virtue." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner believed that these critics and even some of his friends profoundly 
misunderstood his ideas. He did not want to control people, he maintained. He 
used the word control, he said, as an astronomer might do in speaking of the 
control one planet exercises on another. 
</P>
<P>
"People were controlled by their physical and social environments, but that did 
not mean that any person should control them," he wrote in the third volume of 
his autobiography, "A Matter of Consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Skinner, public perception to the contrary, advocate punishment. In 
fact, he disliked it and thought it an ineffective method of control because 
the punished does not so much seek to change his behavior as to avoid 
punishment. Skinner thought positive reinforcement, or rewards, would work 
better and with fewer unhappy side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Although Skinner could be critical of himself -- once noting: "I do not admire 
myself as a person. My successes do not override my shortcomings" -- the 
criticism leveled at his theories bothered him to the point that eventually he 
could no longer read much of it. And during the controversy that enveloped him 
following the publication of "Beyond Freedom and Dignity," he suffered from 
angina. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s Skinner, by then frail and bird-like, seemed to generate more 
reverence, awe, even affection, than contention among psychological colleagues. 
They gave him standing ovations after his speeches, which at times criticized 
some of them, at the American Psychological Assn. conventions. He was sometimes 
besieged by autograph seekers and fans in scenes more reminiscent of a movie 
premiere than a professional gathering. At the convention this month, the 
American Psychological Assn. gave him a lifetime contribution citation. 
</P>
<P>
But the grand old man of behaviorism was not happy about the trends he saw in 
psychology. In the waning years of Skinner's life, cognitive psychology with 
its emphasis on the mind was to increase in influence. Skinner termed cognitive 
psychology a retreat to ancient explanations of human behavior, to love, will, 
feelings, states of mind. 
</P>
<P>
He complained of a "conspicuous relaxation" in the use of scientific 
principles. "Nothing of importance was happening in psychology," he said. "In 
divorcing itself from behaviorism . . . it was relinquishing its claim to being 
a science." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Skinner was best summed up, both professionally and personally, by the 
citation that accompanied the American Psychological Assn.'s Distinguished 
Scientific Contribution Award, which was presented to him in 1958. It called 
him "an imaginative and creative scientist, characterized by great objectivity 
in scientific matters and by warmth and enthusiasm in personal contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner was born March 20, 1904, in the railroad town of Susquehanna, Pa., to 
William Arthur Skinner, a lawyer, and Grace Burrhus Skinner, whose maiden name 
became her son's unusual first name. Of it, Skinner observed: "It has always 
been troublesome: It must be spelled out and explained." So to his friends, he 
was Fred. 
</P>
<P>
He described his boyhood as "warm and stable." He wrote that he was never 
punished by his father and only once by his mother who, when he used a bad 
word, washed his mouth out with soap. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy Skinner was intrigued by mechanics and gadgets, and built everything 
from steerable sleds and rafts to a steam cannon that would shoot plugs of 
potato and carrot over neighbors' houses. He failed, however, in his attempts 
to make a perpetual motion machine and a glider in which he could fly. 
</P>
<P>
During high school he held a variety of jobs from collecting telephone bills 
and selling shoes to playing saxophone in a jazz band and writing for the local 
newspaper, where he composed a few ads, wrote reminiscences of the town and 
occasionally covered a meeting or concert. 
</P>
<P>
He had begun writing stories and poems at an early age, and the original 
aspiration of the youth who would become a giant of behavioral psychology was 
for a literary career. When he went to Hamilton College at Clinton, N.Y., he 
majored in English and contributed to the campus literary and humor magazines. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from college in 1926, Skinner opted to spend a year writing 
fiction and soon "discovered the unhappy fact that I had nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
As he floundered about during that "dark year" in search of a vocation, he read 
a series of magazine articles by philosopher Bertrand Russell that dealt in 
part with John B. Watson's behaviorism. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913 Watson, revolting against introspection and speculation in psychology, 
had called for it to become a science of behavior rather than a study of the 
mind. Man's behavior should be studied by external observation and measurement 
just as that of other animals was. 
</P>
<P>
Forget man's mind, Watson had said. Even if it existed, it could not be studied 
objectively by observation and measurement as behavior could. Watson's 
challenge led to a deep schism in psychology between behaviorists and 
mentalists. 
</P>
<P>
When years later Skinner told Russell that his articles had converted him to 
behaviorism, the philosopher replied: "Good heavens, I thought it had 
demolished behaviorism." 
</P>
<P>
A 1927 magazine article in which H. G. Wells praised Ivan Pavlov, the father of 
classical or Pavlovian conditioning, over playwright George Bernard Shaw 
confirmed Skinner's decision to abandon literature for psychology. 
</P>
<P>
With that decision made, he pleasurably sampled the Bohemian life in Greenwich 
Village for a few months before entering Harvard University as a graduate 
psychology student in the fall of 1928. 
</P>
<P>
And at Harvard, the positive reinforcer for his conversion seemed to come less 
from what he was learning in the classroom than from his work in the machine 
shop where psychology researchers made much of their own equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The shop was the center of my activity," he later wrote. 
</P>
<P>
One result was the Skinner Box, in which a laboratory animal was carefully 
sealed so that stray stimuli would not contaminate the experiment. In this 
controlled environment Skinner was able to observe and record the animal's 
patterns of behavior to a variety of consequences. The Skinner Box was a more 
sophisticated descendant of Edward Lee Thorndike's puzzle box in which the 
latter had studied the behavior of cats. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, he was to conclude that the early behaviorists were too 
simplistic in their thinking. Conditioning was more complex and subtle than 
their simple stimulus-response cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner was awarded his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1931, but not before his 
unorthodox doctoral thesis had been rejected by the chairman of his committee. 
Instead of changing his thesis, Skinner resubmitted it to a new committee, 
which approved it. (Ironically, 27 years later Skinner would succeed that 
disapproving chairman as Harvard's Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology.) 
</P>
<P>
The thesis was the basis for Skinner's book, "The Behavior of Organisms: An 
Experimental Analysis," published in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving his doctorate, Skinner remained five more years at Harvard, 
where he continued his animal research. Skinner worked first with rats and then 
with pigeons, which had a much longer life span. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936 he accepted a teaching position at the University of Minnesota and on 
Nov. 1 of that year married Yvonne Blue. The couple had two daughters, Julie, 
now a psychologist, and Deborah, an artist. 
</P>
<P>
When the Skinners decided to have their second child, Mrs. Skinner said she 
rather dreaded the first year or two of its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
To simplify the baby's care, her husband invented a baby tender, an enclosed, 
crib-sized living space with sound-absorbing walls and a large picture window 
through which the child could observe the world beyond and be observed. Moist, 
warm, filtered air was circulated through it so that the baby was freed of the 
need for clothes and blankets. He rigged it with special toys, and Deborah was 
frequently taken out for cuddling and play during the 2 1/2 years she spent in 
the box. 
</P>
<P>
A story about this "air crib" in a national magazine appalled many readers who 
criticized Skinner for "the baby in the box." 
</P>
<P>
One person who did not criticize him was Deborah, who many years later as an 
artist living in London, told an interviewer: "I think I was a very happy baby. 
Most of the criticisms of the box are by people who don't understand what it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, Skinner became a faculty member and briefly chairman of the psychology 
department at Indiana University. It was in that same year that he wrote his 
only novel, "Walden Two," in a seven-week burst of intensive creativity. 
</P>
<P>
It described a behaviorally engineered utopian community founded by an escapee 
from academic psychology named Frazier whose views corresponded to Skinner's 
laboratory findings. The narrator, Burris, a college professor with traditional 
ideas, was skeptical when he visited the community initially but was eventually 
persuaded to join it. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not know until I had finished the book that I was both Burris and 
Frazier," Skinner later wrote. "I let Frazier say things that I myself was not 
yet ready to say to anyone. . . . Eventually I became a devout Frazierian." 
</P>
<P>
The book was not published until 1948, when it drew mixed reviews. "Walden Two" 
was attacked by some critics, distressed by its behavioral engineering, as a 
dystopia. The book initially sold only a few thousand copies, but came into its 
own in the rebellious 1960s. Several communities were formed that attempted to 
emulate "Walden Two." By 1982, more than 2 million copies of the book had been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947 Skinner returned to Harvard as a lecturer and the following year became 
a professor there, where he remained until retiring in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting his daughter's fourth grade arithmetic class on Nov. 11, 1953, 
he was appalled at the way it was being taught. He began applying operant 
conditioning to the classroom, and the result was a teaching machine with 
programmed learning that allowed a student to proceed at his own pace and aimed 
at stimulating his interest with positive reinforcement. Skinner demonstrated 
his first machine the next year. 
</P>
<P>
After a flurry of interest, however, these machines disappeared from the 
educational scene and were supplanted a generation later by computers. Skinner 
blamed the demise of those early machines in part on a burst of commercialism 
and poor programming by some who rushed into the field. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, Skinner was troubled by declining health. His eyesight and 
hearing began failing, he underwent radiation therapy for a tumor in a salivary 
gland and developed leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the scientific observer, Skinner placed his declining powers in an operant 
behaviorism context: 
</P>
<P>
"As the senses grow dull, the stimulating environment becomes less clear," he 
said. "When reinforcing consequences no longer follow, we are bored, 
discouraged, and depressed. . . . Our environment is no longer maintaining 
strong behavior."
