FLOOD OF CHANGE IS POISED TO WASH OVER VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
INTERESTS VIE FOR FERTILE SAN PASQUAL, WHERE RESIDENTS HOPE TO KEEP TIME AT BAY

<P>
San Pasqual Valley, that fertile flood plain that divides the San Diego 
neighborhood of Rancho Bernardo from the fast-growing city of Escondido, is a 
place where time seems to have stood still. At least until recently, when 
someone wound the clock and set the alarm for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The valley, just upstream from Lake Hodges, looks much as it did 100 years ago 
when farmers there boasted of growing giant sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
One early-day visitor, a doubting Thomas who scoffed at the claims, had his 
bluff called by a valley native. After the visitor returned home to New York 
State, he received a 27-pound yam in the mail -- c.o.d. from San Pasqual 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But that was 1887, and today the sweet potatoes are market-size and not too 
profitable a crop. Before long, the potato crops and cornfields will be 
history, replaced by specialty crops that yield more dollars per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial nursery stock and tree farms now stand where fields of barley and 
hay once were. Soon some of the commercial growers who replaced the valley 
farmers will themselves be replaced by a city of San Diego water-reclamation 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The picturesque San Pasqual Winery, established in the early 1970s to revive an 
industry that flourished there in the 1800s, found the going too rough in 
modern competition and went bankrupt. New owners have started to replant the 
vineyards, but the winery still must import most of its grapes as its acreage 
shrinks to make way for a golf course and adjoining estate homes. 
</P>
<P>
The sheep that once ranged the hills around the valley have been replaced by 
subdivisions. A few sheep still wander through the lowlands, allowed to graze 
at random to keep down the weeds on fallow land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hardly a House Seen 
</P>
<P>
Yet the view along the valley floor to the east from Interstate 15 is still 
bucolic. The dusty farm roads still meander through the bottomland, and hardly 
a house can be seen. The greens, browns and yellows of a rural landscape still 
predominate. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks pretty much like it did when we first came here," said Frank Konyn, 
owner of a prosperous dairy on 100 acres with 750 head of dairy cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to walk in over that hill. The road wasn't here then," Konyn said of 
the day in 1962 when he first brought his wife to see the acreage he had 
leased. "I asked her if we should build our house here, and she said yes, but 
only if it had air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, Konyn smiled wryly and predicted that "the whole place will 
be a park." 
</P>
<P>
The San Dieguito River Regional Park, a proposed 43-mile-long linear greenbelt 
stretching from the ocean at Del Mar to the river's headwaters near Ramona, is 
well along the road to becoming a reality. And the San Pasqual Valley is smack 
in the middle of its path. 
</P>
<P>
Can ranches and dairy farms and nurseries and vineyards coexist with hiking 
trails, golf courses, fishing lakes and equestrian centers? San Pasqual Valley 
residents are divided on the issue and keenly aware of the threatened intrusion 
of the outside world into their quiet way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Valley residents have opted for a status-quo future for the fertile floor of 
their valley in their community plan, but the prospect of a regional park and 
half a dozen opposing pressures have arisen in recent years to threaten their 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
* The treasure trove of sand -- high-quality construction-grade sand -- lying 
in the valley floor beneath the farmland. 
</P>
<P>
* The prospect of a major dam and reservoir on one of two major streams that 
feed the valley's underground water table. 
</P>
<P>
* The pressures of growth, which already are apparent on the hillsides, where 
the spires of a regional shopping center and a massive retirement complex rise 
among the manicured lawns and curving streets of upscale subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
* The need for undeveloped flood plain as mitigation areas to replace habitat 
for endangered birds and wildlife destroyed by major projects elsewhere. If 
ever built, the Pamo Dam, for example, would require about 240 acres of habitat 
mitigation to replace the wetlands inundated by the resultant reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
* The valley's agricultural industry itself, which has degraded the soil and, 
in the western end of the valley, deposited nitrates and other chemicals in 
concentrations that poison the soil for growers and threaten the quality of 
water in the city's Lake Hodges reservoir, immediately to the west. 
</P>
<P>
* The perennial financial pinch of San Diego city government. The city owns 
almost all of San Pasqual Valley, acquired after a 1958 legal fight over water 
rights ended with a verdict that the city had damaged the valley farmers by 
building Sutherland Dam upstream and reducing the underground water table. 
</P>
<P>
With rising governmental costs have come pressures for increasing returns on 
the city-owned farmland, pressures that have caused growers of traditional 
crops to lose out in the bidding to specialty growers who can afford to pay 
higher rent because they earn more per acre for their produce. 
</P>
<P>
A recent bid proposal by the city to lease land across the road from the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park drew, among others, lucrative bids from three companies 
interested in developing a golf course in the valley. The bid proposal was 
withdrawn to allow city officials to ponder the financial and ethical 
implications of leasing the traditionally agricultural acreage for a 
recreational purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fodder for Animals 
</P>
<P>
The Wild Animal Park, the first major recreational use in San Pasqual Valley, 
is eyeing the same tract of land to grow fodder for its hundreds of animals. It 
remains to be seen whether the popular park can bid against commercial 
enterprises for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime valley leaseholders say the line has already been crossed that allows 
commercial activity within the city-owned agricultural preserve. For nearly two 
decades, the San Pasqual Winery carried on commercial activities with a city 
permit. When the William Jaeger winery took over the lease last year, it was 
granted even greater commercial leeway over protests from neighbors who felt 
the agricultural area should not be used for wine-tasting parties and other 
social events. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Knowles, city agricultural lease manager, concedes that prices are going 
up in the valley as arable land becomes scarce. With each rise in price, some 
of the leaseholders are priced out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few farmers making any money anymore," Knowles said. "Someday 
the whole valley will be in commercial-nursery stock." 
</P>
<P>
To Mike Horwath, a former leaseholder who moved his fields of artichoke and 
rhubarb to Valley Center, the valley should remain "a varied agricultural 
setting," a miniature of what the county's coastal slopes and inland valleys 
once were -- cows and chickens, corn and oats, flowers and vineyards, citrus 
and avocado, row crops, orchards and dairies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Future Generations 
</P>
<P>
Horwath, who headed the San Pasqual-Lake Hodges Planning Group for two years, 
believes that the residents of the valley share his dream of preserving the 
landscape as it was, as an agricultural preserve to serve future generations as 
a showplace where parents can take their children to show them the way it was 
in the old days and teachers can take youngsters on field trips. 
</P>
<P>
One way to preserve agriculture in the valley, Horwath said, is to have a 
tiered rental rate for city leases so that poultry farmers would not be bidding 
against landscape nurseries for acreage. 
</P>
<P>
Horwath tried and failed to rouse valley residents to create their own specific 
plan for the valley lands that would rule out further intrusion of commercial 
businesses and strictly limit the types of recreational uses to those that did 
not interfere with agricultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
"La Jolla did its own plan. Mission Valley did its own plan. If we want to have 
the valley remain the way we want it, we should do our own plan," he said. 
"Otherwise, the city will do it their way." 
</P>
<P>
But, without city funding, his efforts failed to win support among other valley 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fine, Pure Sand 
</P>
<P>
Sand mining in the valley, until three years ago, was restricted to widening 
and deepening the 8-mile-long natural flood channel running the length of San 
Pasqual Valley. Leaseholders of tracts along the riverbed often made more money 
off mining rights on their leaseholds than they did on agricultural pursuits, 
Knowles said. The fine, pure sand in the valley brought from 10 cents to $1 or 
more per cubic yard. 
</P>
<P>
As land leases expired, the city renegotiated out clauses granting mining 
rights to lessees and brought control and profits from sand removal back to the 
city, only to be halted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency from 
allowing any sand mining until a federal discharge permit was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Valderhaug, deputy city attorney, termed the valley's sand deposits "a very 
valuable asset to the city" -- which could be considered something of an 
understatement. The San Pasqual Valley is estimated to contain 505 million tons 
of this construction industry essential, according to state natural resources 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
At a modest $2-a-ton extraction fee (sand retails at $7.25 a ton), the city of 
San Diego could earn more than $1 billion for the sand in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has legal grounds for fighting the federal permit 
requirement, "we didn't argue the point," Valderhaug said. Plans are under way 
to apply for the needed EPA permit in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Civic Payoff 
</P>
<P>
If and when the permit is granted, the city can cash in on its sand bank 
anytime it is strapped for cash but unwilling or unable to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Cain, a San Diego city engineer overseeing the flood-control operations, 
sees another civic payoff in the buried treasure of sand. 
</P>
<P>
Sand and gravel concerns seeking mining rights in the valley "are going to 
build our flood channel for us and pay us for the privilege of doing it," Cain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent engineering study by San Diego-based Boyle Engineering indicated that 
a 600-foot-wide channel is needed to give valley inhabitants protection against 
a 15-year flood -- a flood of the intensity that statistically should occur 
once in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The current flood channel, which ranges in width from 200 to 300 feet, can be 
expanded by the private sand and gravel contractors under the city's 
supervision, at no civic expense, Cain pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," he said, "we'll make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sword Hanging Over It' 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the 1978-80 storms caused flooding at the level that can be 
expected only twice in a century, Cain said, "the valley has a sword hanging 
over it" in the form of future storms such as those of the past decade that the 
widened channel would be unable to handle. Farmland can be restored after 
floods, he said, "but it is unlikely that any major development could ever be 
allowed in the valley." 
</P>
<P>
Floods judged at the 50-year intensity in 1978-80 turned the valley into a sea 
of muddy, roiling water, destroying cropland, washing out bridges and flooding 
homes during winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
A channel that would protect the valley against 50- or even 100-year floods 
would have to be much wider and deeper than the 600-foot-wide channel. But, 
Cain added, any increase in the 600-foot channel would be "counterproductive," 
taking out more prime land than it would protect. 
</P>
<P>
Both the flood-control project and the proposed Pamo Dam project a dozen miles 
upstream require wildlife habitat replacement, which is scheduled to be placed 
in the San Pasqual Valley. That means that hundreds of acres of river-bank soil 
must be planted in willows and brush, turned into nesting grounds for the least 
Bell's vireo, an endangered songbird, and other threatened or endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Horwath, who has left the valley but still holds it dear, predicts that it 
faces a future as a "dumping ground" for every habitat-mitigation project that 
developers face. Unless the residents band together to plan the future of their 
valley, he said, the fertile land and future recreational uses will be shelved 
to make amends for development elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Into Trouble 
</P>
<P>
Jim Overstreet, the city planner responsible for guiding the valley's future, 
acknowledges that the only approved community plan for San Pasqual was 
completed in 1964. Another plan completed by community planners in 1985 ran 
into trouble when it came before the City Council that year. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which reiterated the will of valley residents to keep the valley in 
agricultural uses, was shelved for two years, or until the Pamo Dam became 
reality. It remains in its pigeonhole while the County Water Authority conducts 
yet another study of the dam site and other alternatives to local water 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
"For myself, I would like to see the valley go on as it has, with as little 
development as possible," Overstreet said. "Hold back the lions and 
encroachment. What I think will happen is the San Dieguito River Regional Park, 
with a minimum of agriculture remaining." 
</P>
<P>
One plus factor for agricultural interests in the valley is the 
water-reclamation plant the city plans to transplant from Mission Valley near 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to a canyon on the southern edge of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Water utilities department spokesmen say the plant, which turns sewage water 
into acceptable irrigation water, will be able to supply growers in the valley 
and also recharge the water table at the western end, leaching out salts and 
chemical wastes deposited from years of farming in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Preserve 
</P>
<P>
Also protecting the present agricultural interests are past City Council 
actions establishing a 4,500-acre agricultural preserve on the valley floor and 
designating the valley as part of the city's urban reserve -- prohibited from 
urban development until 1996 without approval of city voters. 
</P>
<P>
However, attorney Valderhaug pointed out that the agricultural preserve will 
have little impact on the valley's future development because it was formed by 
a simple resolution of a past City Council "and can just as easily be dissolved 
by another resolution passed by the present or future councils." 
</P>
<P>
As for protection against urbanization offered by the urban reserve 
designation, city planners point out, 1996 is only a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty San Pasqual Valley agricultural leases are coming due in the next few 
years, and farmers and ranchers can expect higher lease prices and shorter 
lease terms, city property department officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of more recent leases, farmers in the valley are no longer able to 
obtain free water from their wells just for the pumping costs. Leases now 
contain requirements that the wells be metered and that leaseholders pay the 
city for the water they use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review for New Leases 
</P>
<P>
In addition, under a draft policy still to be approved by the council, all new 
leases would contain a commitment to allow riding and hiking trails through the 
property -- a requirement the valley agriculturists oppose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city property department today controls leasing in the valley, the 
draft plan calls for a review of new leases by half a dozen city departments 
and by the San Diego Regional Park Joint Powers Authority, which holds the 
reins on developing the regional park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, whose district includes the San Pasqual Valley 
and who is a ramrod in the development of the linear park, sees the pressures 
on the valley as a challenge, not as a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have reached what appears to be a happy compromise," Wolfsheimer 
said, explaining that the farming, recreational facilities and sand mining are 
compatible activities for the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"What we had before was a bunch of different community plans up and down the 
(43-mile-long) valley. Now we have strung them all together into a single plan 
that takes into account the wishes of each area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Serene Setting' 
</P>
<P>
Sand mining is a necessity to create flood protection for San Pasqual farmers 
and, at the same time, create a waterway for the regional park, she said, 
adding that agriculture creates "a serene setting" for visitors to the regional 
park and should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"If the park planners were going in and saying, 'No more agriculture in the 
valley,' there would be a problem," she said. "But we won't and we can't, 
because we don't have the money to purchase all the parkland, and we must 
purchase the city land at market rate just like private property. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps 50 or 75 years in the future, things will change and agriculture will 
no longer be in the valley," Wolfsheimer said. "But now we have a happy merger 
of uses: farmlands, greenbelts, open space and waterways. I don't see that 
changing in the San Pasqual Valley for a long time."

SMOKING IS LOSING, CLAIMS LEADER IN WAR ON OLD HABIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America is winning its battle to eradicate smoking, according to David Burns, 
an associate clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Progress toward a smoke-free society has been "stunning . . . and astounding . 
. . given how long it takes for social change with a problem of this 
magnitude," Burns said. "It's very similar to what's occurred with Mothers 
Against Drunk Drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Smoking has long been approached as an individual problem, but it's now seen as 
a larger social issue, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns no longer debates tobacco company representatives over the health effects 
of smoking, "because it's no longer open to debate. . . . This agent causes 
cancer." The debates he now takes part in focus on other issues -- such as 
where and when smoking should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Burns applauded San Diego's health, civic and school leaders for taking steps 
to limit where and when smokers can light up. He is also buoyed by the passage 
of Proposition 99 last November, which authorized the state to use a tobacco 
tax to fund research into programs that will keep nonsmokers from starting to 
smoke as well as to help smokers quit. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99's passage signaled the public's growing belief that smokers and 
tobacco companies should foot the bill for research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Burns is encouraged that the National Cancer Institute, which 
traditionally has funded research into curing cancer, now funds research that 
will help smokers quit -- as well as preventing others from starting. 
</P>
<P>
"NCI is looking at what will work in schools, the doctor's office, with women, 
blacks and Hispanics," he said. They are testing to find out what works in 
various segments of the community, he said. GREG JOHNSON

TENURE AND 'DEADWOOD' AT UC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo for a splendid analysis of teaching and research in our two university 
systems ("UC Tenure: A Forest of Deadwood," Opinion, Aug. 13, by Jack Miles). 
Having taught at both San Diego State University and UCLA, I know that your 
facts are right and I concur wholeheartedly in your evaluation of the problem, 
except that I do not think that we need to refer to teachers who do not publish 
as deadwood. the attack should not be directed towards them. Not everyone is 
capable of lifelong research and most of us accept the benefits of our 
situation. The fault lies with the university administration, which tolerates 
this use of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, I and a colleague at SDSU got a California law enacted that required 
that comparative data on the money spent per student in the UC and CSUC systems 
be presented to legislators. Before that, the striking difference in funding 
had been obscured by accounting techniques. Unfortunately, the passage of the 
law coincided with a downturn in funding. Moreover, Chancellor Glenn Dumke had 
no taste for fighting for his students. Disparities exist not only in the 
teaching load of the faculty but also in the counseling benefits for students. 
At that time the San Diego Union ran a story about a straight-A student at SDSU 
who was not accepted at a single medical school. Their reporter discovered that 
the student had had no help preparing his medical school applications while 
UCSD students 10 miles North of him not only got counseling on how to take the 
exams, but could participate in mock interviews as well. 
</P>
<P>
Again, my congratulations to you for a splendid article.

TENURE AND 'DEADWOOD' AT UC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a graduate student in the UC system and having served for nine months on a 
tenure and promotions committee at UC Irvine, I find Miles' argument both 
misleading and wrongheaded. First, he gives no supporting evidence for the 
"distressingly large" number of tenured deadwood in the system, something that 
in my experience with the actual promotions committee caseload was very rare. 
</P>
<P>
For what I found to be the few tenured UC faculty who fit his image of 
deadwood, Miles' promotes a wrong-headed vision of education by insisting that 
UC system students be exposed to even more of their teaching. If these people 
have so little regard for what academic life is about (they're thieves, 
according to Miles), why should we want them to educate the finest students the 
state of California has or can attract? In the hopes of punishing these few and 
protecting California taxpayers, Miles would undermine the very thing he 
rightly perceives a need for: "an explosion of demand for the kind of 
high-quality university education the UC system manages to offer at a 
relatively low price." 
</P>
<P>
Miles is simply wrong about tenure and teaching in the UC system. Rather than a 
form of early retirement, tenure is an investment in intellectual work that is 
carefully made during a usually rigorous process of review. If there are 
disruptions in the quantity of publications after tenure (Miles eschews 
quality, something the actual review process considers carefully) it could be 
the professor is taking intellectual risks by trying to push her and our 
understanding of a field beyond its current boundaries. While time is often 
money from a budgetary point of view, time is not the equivalent of effective 
teaching in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than punish a poor research record with forced teaching, why not change 
the tenure and promotion process in the UC system so that exceptional teaching 
is more directly rewarded?

MALATHION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I was interviewed by Michael Balter on the matter of risk assessment 
and he struck me as an intelligent and well-intentioned journalist. But I think 
his Aug. 11 Op-Ed piece, "Drops of Mistrust Cloud Malathion Spray," was much 
more misleading than any of the public reassurances he so vigorously attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Our department funded the USC study he discussed, yet I hardly recognize it 
from his description. He failed to tell your readers that this large study of 
malathion did not show even a hint of extra risk for sensitive toxic indicators 
such as premature labor or intrauterine growth retardation. There was no 
significant extra risk of miscarriages (which is also thought to be a sensitive 
early indicator of toxicity) or for the totality of birth defects taken 
together. These measurements were the study's strong points, the areas in which 
it was quite sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mr. Balter chose to emphasize to your readers some very weakly positive 
results which the study's author did not view as biologically credible. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it is true that epidemiological studies cannot absolutely rule out 
any risk from a product. Indeed, no kind of scientific study can do this. 
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Balter's very selective account of the USC study has probably convinced 
most of your readers that malathion as applied in Los Angeles is dangerous to 
them, and that public officials have been hiding incriminating evidence. I 
believe that neither assertion is true. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the USC study is as big and as good an epidemiological study 
as you are ever going to get. Taken together with what we know about the low 
exposure from malathion protein bait (it's not a liquid spray) and the balance 
of the biological evidence (it's been used to treat head lice in England), a 
lot of well-trained scientists who have dedicated their careers to public 
health happen to think that aerial application of malathion to control Medfly 
is safe for public use. 
</P>
<P>
I regret that Mr. Balter thinks that this evaluation of safety is "exaggerated" 
or "misrepresents" the evidence. Your readers should know, however, that he has 
treated them to a very selective and filtered picture of that scientific 
evidence.

A RISKY ROLE FOR U.N. IN CAMBODIA; 
</P>
<P>
IF PEACEKEEPERS GO IN, IT MUST BE WITH A CONSENSUS

The international community is about to ask the United Nations to be both 
midwife and guarantor of Cambodia's future. There really is no alternative. 
Having survived the horrors of the Khmer Rouge killing fields and the 
Vietnamese occupation, the people of Cambodia could face protracted civil war 
after the Vietnamese withdraw in late September. After all, it has been the 
Vietnamese enemy that has bound together a most unlikely coalition of 
resistance forces, each with its own major power patron. Since there are no 
neutrals at the Paris peace conference, only the United Nations has any hope of 
brokering a compromise minimally acceptable to each of the competing factions 
and interests. 
</P>
<P>
But caution should be the guiding principle. At this point, neither the 
political, nor military, nor material conditions exist for a successful U.N. 
intervention. And no one should have any illusions about the United Nations' 
ability to perform overnight miracles, no matter how many Nobel Peace Prizes it 
garners. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in Paris to request the dispatch of U.N. fact-finders makes good 
sense as a first step. Yet there is no agreement or clear understanding on what 
steps should follow. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that Cambodia typifies a new generation of conflict: wars between 
domestic opponents sometimes acting as proxies for outside powers. U.N. 
peacekeeping has worked best against old-fashioned wars when there are only two 
parties -- preferably nation states -- to the conflict, boundaries are 
well-defined and the military situation is at a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
For the two kinds of conflict the task of the intervener could not be more 
different. In one, peacekeeping is passive; it buffers combatants as diplomats 
convert cease-fires into peace treaties -- often by exchanging some territory. 
</P>
<P>
In a civil war the job is far messier. If a country is to avoid partition, 
territorial settlements won't suffice. Instead, a governable national fabric 
has to be rewoven from a tangle of political, ideological, ethnic, tribal, 
religious and other threads. The peacemaker becomes a surrogate state-builder, 
monitoring elections, resettling refugees and rebuilding the economy, 
bureaucracy and infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
As the United Nations' own record attests, the transition from peacekeeping to 
state-building can be a dangerous and uncertain one. In the Congo, the United 
Nations was sucked into full-scale combat, splitting the Security Council and 
sacrificing the life of its secretary general. In Lebanon, the U.N. 
peacekeeping force is as much a victim caught in a cross-fire as a buffer. In 
Namibia, both the rebels and South Africa have repeatedly challenged the United 
Nations' mandate. And in Afghanistan, it has proven easier to get the Soviets 
out than to get the killing stopped. 
</P>
<P>
With such experience, the United Nations could be forgiven for politely 
refusing the entreaties to save Cambodia, to reserve its peacekeeping energies 
for more clear-cut conflicts. But there are few of those left. A whole 
generation of Third World conflicts is winding down without clear winners. 
Increasingly, member states are too eager to dump their unsolved problems in 
the United Nations' lap. What is less clear is whether they are willing to 
equip the organization with the political and financial tools necessary to 
execute so many demanding missions. 
</P>
<P>
With proper support, the United Nations can, and should, respond to this new 
set of challenges. But it should resist adding Cambodia to its already full 
plate until minimal conditions for success are met. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese, who have complained of U.N. bias against them, and all domestic 
factions must be willing to cooperate with the organization and to live up to 
all of the terms of the agreement now being negotiated. U.N. peacekeepers on 
their own should not be expected to tame the Khmer Rouge or resist another 
Vietnamese intervention. It is up to China and the Soviet Union to cut off arms 
and assistance to their clients if they are uncooperative. If the peace process 
breaks down anyway, then it is up to the major powers to give the United 
Nations the military and political wherewithal to enforce its mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the five permanent members of the Security Council should be 
prepared to live with the decisions of the Cambodian people, even if the 
factions that they favor do not fare well. Since each of the five has a veto 
over further U.N. action, their unity and support are essential. 
</P>
<P>
The mandate and timetable for U.N. involvement should be very carefully and 
clearly spelled out. The United Nations cannot afford another Namibian 
experience, where squabbling over the size and cost of the force and 
last-minute logistical snafus prevented the U.N. peacekeepers from being in 
place in time to prevent violations of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
The major donor countries should be prepared to sustain long-term, substantial 
financial support for the operation, whether or not it initially shows signs of 
suc- ceeding. Japan may be prepared to carry an extra burden, but the whole 
enterprise could be crippled if the U.S. Congress again tries to nit-pick it to 
death with unilateral conditions and withholdings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, any peacekeeping commitments should be undertaken only as part of a 
much larger humanitarian and development program designed to rebuild Cambodia 
and to give peace a chance. This should be a natural for the United Nations, 
which is usually better at carrots than sticks. 
</P>
<P>
The risks will still be great and the outcome unpredictable. But with proper 
preparation, the United Nations, itself a radical experiment in international 
cooperation, should take the plunge.

AT ONE SCHOOL THAT WORKS, MONEY MIGHT WORK WONDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON TUROVSKY, Ron Turovsky is an attorney in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's leadership continues to debate the level of funding for our 
schools. Los Angeles officials continue to debate whether and where to open new 
schools. In the background, there seems to be a perception that our inner-city 
public schools are a wasteland, that they are dangerous places where little 
learning goes on, and that nothing can be done. A recent visit to Huntington 
Park High School offers evidence that our schools are not lost, and that an old 
solution -- money -- would have a positive impact. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was taken with, among others, William Lambert, governmental relations 
director of United Teachers-Los Angeles. The visit was not announced to the 
administration in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington High is south of downtown L.A. It is in an old, decaying, industrial 
and residential area, although it is surrounded by new and well-maintained 
single-family homes, a HUD development. The student body is nearly all Latino. 
It is a year-round school and was in full session during the August visit. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington does not comport with the stereotypical portrait of the inner-city 
school. True, two armed police officers patrol the campus. A sign that says 
"Keep Our Schools Clean" is covered with graffiti. The dropout rate is 
extraordinarily high. In one wing of the school, no English is spoken by the 
any of the students in the halls. 
</P>
<P>
The halls, however, are not the domain of uncontrolled toughs. Neither gangs 
nor drugs are evident. Other than the markings on the sign, graffiti is not a 
problem. Students seem to be listening and working. Teachers appear in control. 
</P>
<P>
What the school does suffer from is intense overcrowding. In all, Huntington 
handles about 3,600 kids. Due to the year-round format, 2,400 kids attend at 
any time. The format, however, only eases the overcrowding. Kids are stuffed in 
every nook and cranny. A math class is taught in the light machine shop; kids 
with textbooks sit surrounded by machinery. Another is taught in the gym. A 
special education course is taught in the auditorium dressing room. Three 
remedial classes simultaneously are conducted in the cafeteria; there are no 
dividers between the classes. Kids eat lunch on tables placed on a blocked-off 
street. On rainy days, they are forced inside -- on stairways, in the halls, 
wherever. 
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding only will get worse. About 3,000 students are enrolled at 
Miles Elementary School, which feeds into Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington also suffers from physical decay and poor maintenance. There is an 
aerial photograph of the school circa 1925 in the principal's office. It was an 
impressive facility then, with its distinctive facade rising up over acres of 
unspoiled land. 
</P>
<P>
Years of neglect have had their impact, and the current pressure on the 
facility only adds to the problem. Because the students attend 17 fewer days, 
school days are longer. At night, the school is an adult education facility for 
2,400. On Saturdays, the school is the venue for an immigrant education 
program. It is in constant use, which strains the facility and makes it 
inaccessible for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the paint and the buildings are chipping and wearing away. Live 
sockets are broken and exposed. Air conditioning does not work; classes are 
conducted in 100-degree heat, with old fans blowing hot air. Light fixtures are 
broken or missing bulbs; one teacher pointed out that the lights even fail to 
power the solar calculators that students use. The machines used in the 
technical classes are vintage 1940. Kids who must enter a highly competitive 
high-tech marketplace are being taught on yesterday's equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' facilities make the faculty feel like unwelcome visitors. The 110 
teachers present at any time have two "lounges." One is about 12 feet by 20; 
with its garage-sale couches, faded paint, ancient bathroom stall and dim 
lighting, it resembles a tenement hotel room. The other lounge is slightly 
larger, but has the same discarded furniture interior. "These couches were 
donated by parents," a teacher said. "The old ones had rats." One of the school 
wings is equipped with a single faculty bathroom, which contains one toilet 
that does not flush. 
</P>
<P>
But the school does not present an intractable problem. When the manifestations 
are drugs and gangs and students that do not listen and teachers that have 
given up, the problems defy short-term solution and, arguably, more money may 
change little. But when students are listening, and teachers have not yet given 
up, and the problems involve too many students and toilets that do not flush 
and air conditioners that do not cool and learning math in dark classrooms 
surrounded by outdated machines, these are things that new and better 
facilities can cure. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to expand at Huntington is gone. Why did the district not 
expand when adjacent land was vacant? "Stupidity," said Lambert. "Instead, 
homes were built, which brings in more kids." 
</P>
<P>
But the school can be improved, and new schools can be built in other places. 
As Huntington's vice principal said at the end of the visit: "Give us a little 
help. It's basically called money."

AIM OF SOVIET OPPOSITION IS FINDING BEST WAYS TO FEED AND CLOTHE THE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKHAIL POLTORANIN, Mikhail Poltoranin, a people's deputy of the Soviet 
Union, is a member of the coordinating council of the Inter-Regional Caucus. 
His commentary was supplied by the Novosti Press Agency.

<P>
When Boris N. Yeltsin made an official statement before the Supreme Soviet 
about the creation of the Inter-Regional Caucus of People's Deputies, some 
members questioned our timing and our patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates of "monolithic unity" say that we are trying to split the 
2,250-strong Congress of People's Deputies. We are against a split, but we are 
for a democratic parliament in which deputies are not pawns in the Kremlin's 
game. We are full-fledged political figures with the legitimate right to create 
groups inside the parliament based on an array of political, economic and other 
vital interests. Working together, it is easier to act the way the voters want 
us to. 
</P>
<P>
The inter-regional caucus includes farmers, workers, doctors, engineers, 
writers and scientists. There are about 400 of us thus far -- deputies from all 
of the Soviet republics except Turkmenia. The platform that united us was 
explained in the first issue of the paper People's Deputy, which the group 
issued for the opening of its conference: 
</P>
<P>
"The level of life continues to decline catastrophically. How can we clothe and 
feed the country? There are different ways. We need the shortest and the most 
effective. The majority at the Congress (of People's Deputies) refused to 
embark on this. The solution of crucial problems is being postponed 
indefinitely. Hence the strikes and the aggravation of ethnic and social 
tensions. The Inter-Regional Caucus of People's Deputies of the U.S.S.R. has 
set forth the task of uniting all the healthy forces toward taking the country 
out of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Our caucus sees the way out in more radical perestroika reforms: transition of 
all power to the people and the land and the means of production to the working 
people. According to an opinion poll, 83% of caucus members stand for the 
political and economic self-determination of the Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the last day of the Congress of People's Deputies in June, we 
worked well into the night writing the "manifesto" of our inter-regional 
caucus. The manifesto was signed by more than 150 deputies. In the morning we 
asked the Presidium to give us an opportunity to read the document at the 
session. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked me into postponing the 
announcement. His arguments were very persuasive: Houses were being set on fire 
in Fergana, Uzbekistan, and clouds of ethnic tension were thickening in other 
regions. We agreed and also postponed the conference that was to finalize the 
creation of our caucus. 
</P>
<P>
At last the conference was held at the end of July. It worked out a program of 
action and a package of alternative draft laws to be submitted to the Supreme 
Soviet for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Such a caucus is an unprecedented phenomenon on the Soviet political scene. 
Probably this explains the apprehensive attitude of some members of the upper 
echelon. Our opponents want to pit the country's leaders against us by alleging 
that we are trying to knock together the core of a future opposition party or a 
shadow Supreme Soviet, despite the fact that there are 90 members of the 
present Supreme Soviet in our caucus and that Gorbachev recognizes its status. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's bureaucracy wants to present our conference as the attempt of Yeltsin, 
the "troublemaker," to assert himself as the indisputable leader of the pack. 
This is not true. On the eve of the conference, we, the members of its 
organizing body, discussed in a room at the Hotel Moskva the question of 
chairmanship. The majority named Yeltsin. But Yeltsin was the one who suggested 
a co-chairmanship. We could not come to an agreement and decided to sleep on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When the debates began at the conference the next morning, the chair on which 
Yeltsin was sitting suddenly collapsed. I noticed because I was sitting next to 
him and joked that this was a symbol of the collapse of totalitarian authority 
in our country. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, we made a choice in favor of collective leadership. The conference 
nominated a 25-person coordinating council of the caucus and elected its five 
co-chairmen: Yeltsin, Yuri N. Afanasyev, Viktor Palm, Gavriil Popov and Andrei 
D. Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
Now the session is over. The deputies have gone back to their constituents. 
Time will show whether the voters believe in our ideas.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWO LIVES CLAIMED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were killed and a third was seriously injured in traffic accidents in 
the East San Fernando Valley late Saturday and early Sunday, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of a converted 1965 Volkswagen "Baja Bug" was killed in a head-on 
collision with another car on Sunland Boulevard near Wornom Avenue about 10:30 
p.m. Saturday, said Sgt. Jim Gicking. 
</P>
<P>
He said the driver of the Volkswagen, whose identity was not released, 
apparently veered into oncoming traffic, striking a 1984 Honda Accord. The man 
had purchased the "Baja Bug" only hours before the accident, Gicking said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Honda, Michael Thornton, 38, a Sunland teacher, suffered 
broken legs and head and chest injuries and was in critical condition Sunday at 
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In a second accident, a pedestrian was killed when he was struck by a 
hit-and-run driver at a Pacoima crosswalk early Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Reyes, 53, was found lying in the middle of Laurel Canyon Boulevard at 
Mercer Street about 1:30 a.m. by a passer-by, Gicking said. He was pronounced 
dead at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
There were no witnesses to the accident, Gicking said.

WHITSON BRUSHES OFF FLU AND EXPOS FOR CAREER-HIGH 15TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Whitson awoke at 4:40 Sunday morning feeling awful. His head hurt. His body 
ached. He was burning with fever. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to go back to sleep, but it was useless. So he simply stayed in bed, 
hoping, praying that this flu bug he caught would not prevent him from 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe ordinarily I wouldn't have gone out there to pitch," Whitson said, "but 
I wanted this one so bad. I was going to give it everything I had, for as long 
as I had." 
</P>
<P>
There were times when Whitson wondered if he was going to make it. He even had 
to come into the clubhouse after the fourth inning because he thought he was 
going to be sick. In the seventh inning, he simply was too fatigued to 
continue, but yet stubborn enough to curse when pitching coach Pat Dobson came 
to the mound to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
When the game ended, Whitson was still lying on the trainer's table, but the 
scoreboard said it all: Padres 5, Montreal Expos 2. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lee Whitson, the man who was given up for dead by the New York Yankees, 
established a career high with his 15th victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember this game for as long as I live," said Whitson (15-9). 
"This game and the third game in the (1984) playoffs are probably the biggest 
wins I've gotten in my career. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there were a lot of people who wrote me off when I was in New York. 
I worked my butt off because I wanted to prove them all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, as far as I'm concerned, I'm just getting started." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who last won in Montreal on Aug. 27, 1980, when he was with the San 
Francisco Giants, established his previous career high in 1984 with the Padres. 
But after 14 victories that season, he posted a 39-41 record over the next four 
seasons, going to New York as a $4-million free agent, returning as a pitcher 
whose confidence was shattered, and revitalizing his career this season. 
</P>
<P>
He has emerged as the ace of the Padre pitching staff, and with probably eight 
starts remaining this season, has a shot at becoming only the 35th pitcher this 
decade to get 20 victories. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, remains a dream, Whitson said. He never envisioned that he'd 
be fortunate enough to come back this far. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's 34 and everything," catcher Mark Parent said, "but even if he 
doesn't win 20 this year, there's no reason why he can't win 20 next year, or 
the year after. I mean, look at him. He's got one of the best bodies in here. I 
wish I could look like that when I'm 34. Shoot, I didn't even look like that 
when I was 18. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just got God-given talent. He can throw as hard as any pitcher around, or 
as soft as any pitcher around. Hitters never know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time in Whitson's younger days when that just did not hold true. 
His temper ate him alive. And the madder he got on the mound, the worse he 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
If it were the old Ed Whitson pitching Sunday, he said, he would have been 
knocked out of the game by the second inning. Third innings, tops. 
</P>
<P>
His last start ended in an excruciating 3-2 loss when the New York Mets scored 
two runs in the bottom of the ninth. In the past, that would have left him 
infuriated for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the big difference between me now and five years ago," he said. "I 
really couldn't accept defeat before. I was a bad loser. I guess I still am, 
but the difference now is that I can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like my last start, the guys in the clubhouse knew that it really got to 
me. It hurt. It hurt bad. But they got on me, just like nothing had ever 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson was brilliant from the outset. He retired the first seven batters he 
faced, 12 of the first 13, and 18 of the first 22. Just four fly balls left the 
infield through the first six innings, and not a single baserunner had reached 
third. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed just four hits in 6 2/3 innings and cruised into the seventh with a 
2-0 lead, and even after allowing a leadoff single to cleanup hitter Tim 
Raines, got two outs with Raines advancing only as far as second. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Fitzgerald hit a double into the right-center gap, prompting Manager 
Jack McKeon to send Mark Davis scurrying to the bullpen. He fell behind three 
balls to No. 8 hitter Spike Owen, and Dobson came to the mound, trying to stall 
for time. His next pitch was ball four. 
</P>
<P>
Expo Manager Buck Rodgers sent switch-hitting Wallace Johnson to the plate. 
Whitson started to toe the rubber when Dobson stepped out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Davis took the mound and Whitson took the table in the training room. Two 
pitches later, Johnson was hitting a ground ball to second baseman Roberto 
Alomar, who flipped to shortstop Bip Roberts for the force. End of rally. End 
of hitting. Subsequently, end of game. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, who had been one for 19 on the trip, assured Whitson of his victory 
by blasting a three-run homer into the right-center field seats for a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched so great in his last outing and didn't get it," Clark said. "I 
wanted to make sure of it this time." 
</P>
<P>
Davis made it a little interesting before recording his 31st save, beginning 
the eighth with a walk to Otis Nixon and a single to Damaso Garcia. Dobson 
quickly trotted to the mound, and asked: "What are you trying to do, set a 
record for the least amount of time between pitches? Throw your breaking ball. 
Why do you do this to me?" 
</P>
<P>
Davis promptly retired the next three batters, allowing a run to score on 
Andres Galarraga's groundout and breezed through the ninth, tying Cub pitcher 
Mitch Williams for the league lead. It was Davis' second-longest save situation 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big game for Ed, and I think it's been on everybody's mind each 
time he's been out there," Davis said. "Now he can relax more, and not have it 
so much on his mind. Maybe now he can go out there and win 20. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I want to be out there, I'd love to save his 20th." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
There's a marked difference in a team's attitude when it's contending for the 
playoffs or playing out the string. Just 2 1/2 hours before game time, third 
baseman Mike Pagliarulo was the only player in the Padre clubhouse. Two hours 
before the game, only catcher Mark Parent had joined him. "Where is everybody?" 
Pagliarulo asked. Well, since there was no batting practice scheduled Sunday, 
the team bus didn't leave the hotel until noon. Most chose to ride it. . . . 
The Padres open their 1990 season in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, according 
to the preliminary National League schedule.

Pat Leahy, whose first extra-point attempt was blocked in the third period, 
kicked a 26-yard field goal with 6:06 left Sunday night to lift the New York 
Jets to a 19-10 exhibition victory over the Philadelphia Eagles at Raleigh, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
A.D. Brown's four-yard touchdown run with 2:04 left clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Mackey threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to K.D. Dunn with 4:45 left in the 
third period, bringing the Jets (1-1) to within 10-9, but Jerome Brown blocked 
Leahy's conversion kick to prevent the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (2-1) threatened to extend its lead by reaching the New York 20 
early in the fourth quarter, but Don McPherson's pass intended for running back 
Heath Sherman was intercepted by linebacker Jackie Walker at the 18. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, the Jets' third-string quarterback, had his playing time extended when 
starter Pat Ryan suffered a sprained left knee late in the first quarter and 
did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams committed turnovers on successive possessions in the first quarter, 
but the Jets turned Erik McMillan's interception of a pass by Randall 
Cunningham into a 46-yard field goal by Leahy with 2:25 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who played all of the first half and one series in the second half, 
led the Eagles on a 66-yard drive that he kept alive with a dive for a first 
down on a fourth-and-one at the New York two-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Toney scored on the next play with 57 seconds left before halftime for 
a 7-3 lead. Max Zendejas added the conversion and kicked a 49-yard field goal 
with 11:32 left in the third period to give Philadelphia a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants 45, Kansas City 7 -- Jeff Rutledge threw three touchdown passes 
and the Giants romped at Kansas City in Marty Schottenheimer's home debut as 
Chiefs' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms, the Giants' regular quarterback who played for the first time this 
season after ending his holdout last Monday, turned things over to Rutledge 
after teaming with Odessa Turner on a 73-yard touchdown play for a 14-7 lead in 
the first period. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants (2-0) scored 21 consecutive points in the second quarter for a 35-7 
halftime lead.

RAMS SCRAPE UP AN OFFENSE TO FACE CARDINALS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight's exhibition between the Rams and Phoenix Cardinals starts at 8, which 
almost wasn't late enough for Coach John Robinson, who was pushing for a little 
midnight madness. 
</P>
<P>
Had wheels not spun to get deals done, he might have been the first head coach 
in history to roam the sidelines with a bag over his head. The mid-week game 
plan was to hit-'em-hard and pray for a power outage. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of days ago, we had no tight ends, no guards, no tailbacks -- I mean 
that's embarrassing," Robinson said. "So we're a little better off." 
</P>
<P>
How much? Well, the Rams have managed to piece together a starting unit that 
includes a tight end, two guards and a tailback. But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
So if you're coming to Anaheim Stadium to boo, at least have an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end: The Rams were down to zero before Friday's trade with Detroit to 
acquire Pat Carter. In one phone call, Carter went from a team that had 
black-marked his position out of the playbook to a starter. Now let's see if he 
can find his way to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't stand around much," Robinson said. "He's got a great opportunity and 
he's got to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Guards: The starters are out. Tom Newberry will rest his hamstring another 
week. Duval Love, who is unsigned, is presumed resting comfortably. Warren 
Wheat, the eighth-round pick, is doubtful with a neck injury. If he can't make 
it, left guard goes to free agent Navy Tuiasasopo, who was playing basketball 
in Laguna Beach when Robinson called a few weeks ago: "Want to play starting 
guard in the National Football League?" 
</P>
<P>
Tuiasasopo said yes, and shipped himself into shape. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Slaton is the right guard, and apparently will open the season there if 
Love doesn't sign in the next hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback: The Gaston Green critique is put on hold for another week as he holds 
an ice pack to his left thigh, which is bruised. Second-year back Robert 
Delpino, who never dreamed a back could carry so many times in practice, will 
start and play the first half. Richard Calvin, a free agent from Washington 
State, should hit the field at about 9:45, which is just about right. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greg Bell holdout rolls on and first-rounder Cleveland Gary, the 
26th overall pick in the draft, rationalizes why he should make twice as much 
as teammate Bill Hawkins, picked five spots ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, the Rams' first unit, due to go the first half tonight, hasn't 
scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett wonders when he can get together with his favorite 
receivers. He hasn't yet thrown a pass that counts to Aaron Cox, Pete Holohan 
or Damone Johnson, who combined for 129 catches and 1,580 yards in 1988. 
Holohan and Cox have missed the first two games with injuries. Johnson is a 
holdout and perilously close to becoming a former starting tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, thankfully, has an extra exhibition game and some time to play with. 
You wouldn't want to start a regular season in this condition. 
</P>
<P>
"After this week, we've got to start going," he said. "If we had four 
(exhibition games), you'd say we had two to mess around with and two to get 
going. We're using three to mess around with. After this week, we'll get 
Newberry back and hopefully we'll make some progress on (Robert) Cox and Damone 
and Love." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have their own problems. Quarterback Neil Lomax refuses to retire 
despite an arthritic hip. Super Bowl coach turned commentator Bill Walsh said 
publicly last week that Lomax is through. . . . The Cardinals' starter at 
quarterback for now is Plan B retread Gary Hogeboom, who tossed three 
first-half interceptions in last week's loss to Seattle. "I was really hoping 
Gary would have had a better first half than he had," Phoenix Coach Gene 
Stallings said. "We had some interceptions, and regardless of what creates it, 
the quarterback is always charged with them." 
</P>
<P>
Second-year quarterback Tom Tupa worked the second half last week and completed 
12 of 27 passes for 108 yards. He led the Cardinals on a 99-yard scoring drive 
in the fourth quarter. Hogeboom and Tupa are expected to split time tonight. 
Lomax will not be in uniform. . . . After one exhibition loss, Stallings 
appears in the head-coaching hot seat. "I try not to worry a whole lot about 
what I can't do anything about," he said. "And that's one of them." . . . The 
Rams broke training camp at Fullerton on Sunday and returned to Rams Park. They 
will play host to the Minnesota Vikings Saturday night in the annual Times 
Charity Game.

SULLIVAN FINALLY ABLE TO SMILE AGAIN

Danny Sullivan flexed his right arm, grimaced, then smiled and waved to the 
crowd around Victory Circle at Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, Pa., 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Indianapolis 500 winner, who has been hampered by a broken arm since 
an accident May 11 in practice for this year's Indy 500, completed his comeback 
with a victory in the Quaker State 500. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who won $98,618, beat Penske Racing teammate Rick Mears in a late 
duel. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm feels all right now," Sullivan said. "It was a little sore during the 
race and I know I'll feel it tomorrow, but right now it feels fine." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan took the lead 12 laps from the end when Michael Andretti, who was 
leading, pitted for fuel. Mears, a three-time Pocono winner, moved past 
Andretti into second place on lap 191 and got to within one second of Sullivan, 
the 1984 Pocono winner, three laps later. 
</P>
<P>
But Sullivan, defending CART-PPG Indy-car champion, wound up beating Mears by 
4.226 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Andretti, who won the last two Indy-car races, was third, followed by 
Teo Fabi of Italy, the last driver on the lead lap, Mario Andretti and, another 
lap back, defending race champion Bobby Rahal. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's race speed of 170.650 m.p.h. broke the 500-mile Pocono record of 
156.701 set in 1974 by Johnny Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
Points leader Emerson Fittipaldi started from the pole and appeared to be on 
the way to a runaway, building margins of up to 25 seconds as he led 63 of the 
first 67 laps. 
</P>
<P>
On lap 68, however, he suddenly slowed and pitted with a broken wheel and 
shredded tire. He was out for 22 laps and failed to finish and his points lead 
over Mears was cut to 143-125. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Wallace, winning his second consecutive Winston Cup event and fifth of 
the season, took the Champion 400 in a NASCAR track race record of 157.704 
m.p.h. at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The record of 156.863 m.p.h. was set by Davey Allison last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace took the lead with 17 laps to go and beat Morgan Shepherd by 15.6 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd passed Harry Gant, who ran out of gas and finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Defending Winston champion Joe Amato won the Top Fuel finals in the NHRA 
Northstar Nationals at Brainerd, Minn., by beating Shirley Muldowney. 
</P>
<P>
While Amato's victory was his second straight and fourth final-round appearance 
in a row, Muldowney was making her first appearance in the finals since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Amato took the win with a quarter-mile time of 5.248 seconds at 278.81 m.p.h., 
while Muldowney smoked her tires and could only watch as Amato raced to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Allen won the Pro Stock competition, while Ed McCullough took the Funny 
Car event.

ANOTHER MIRACLE SHOT CAN'T STOP NORMAN FROM WINNING THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when Greg Norman was coasting, he had another scare. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, deprived of victory by miracle shots in several major tournaments, 
birdied the 17th hole Sunday to win the International tournament at Castle 
Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Norman finished the tournament with 13 points under the modified Stableford 
scoring system used for this event, beating Clarence Rose by two points. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was Chip Beck who threw fear into Norman with a 60-foot eagle putt 
on the 14th hole for five points, drawing him to within two points of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like he made it from halfway to Colorado Springs," Norman said. "I'm 
thinking, 'Oh, no, not again.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Beck hit two shots into the water on the next hole and dropped back to 
seven points. 
</P>
<P>
On the 17th, however, he put his second shot 15 feet from the flag and had a 
chance for another eagle that would have pulled him even. But he left the putt 
short. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Norman took things out of doubt when he followed Beck to 
the 17th and made his decisive birdie. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Norman's sixth on the PGA Tour and his first since winning the 
Heritage in April, 1988. It was worth $180,000 from the total purse of $1 
million and lifted his season's earnings to $531,930. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who now has won 63 tournaments around the world, extended his string of 
major tournament near misses this year when he lost to Mark Calcavecchia in the 
British Open playoff and missed a playoff for the Masters with a bogey on the 
72nd hole. 
</P>
<P>
Norman faced another playoff possibility until he birdied the 17th, breaking a 
tie with Rose, who was looking for his first victory in nine seasons on the PGA 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Playing ahead of Norman, Rose birdied four of the last six holes to get a share 
of the lead at 11 points, but then could only sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger shot his third consecutive 68 to win the $350,000 GTE Northwest 
tournament at Seattle, his first senior victory in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger's total of 12-under-par 204 on the 6,501-yard Inglewood Country Club 
course was three shots better than that of Frank Beard, who also shot a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, the leading money-winner on the senior tour this year, was third 
at 208 after a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bruce Crampton finished in a tie for fourth at 209 with 
Harold Henning, Miller Barber and Mike Hill. Crampton, who also won the 
Northwest Classic in 1986, had a 69. Henning also shot a 69, while first-round 
leader Barber had a 70 and Hill shot a 71. The victory was Geiberger's fifth 
individual title in three years. He teamed with Harold Henning to win the 
Legends of Golf last April, but hadn't won on his own in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Henninger of Eugene, Ore., set a tournament record in posting a 
five-stroke victory in the $110,000 Queen Mary Open at Lakewood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Henninger fired a four-under-par 68 in the final round to finish at 
20-under-par 268, five shots better than the tournament record in the 
18-year-old event. He took home $20,000, the largest paycheck of his three-year 
pro career, with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Bell of Sacramento finished in second place at 273 after shooting a 
final-round 66. He beat out Henninger a week earlier to win the California 
State Open. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sutherland of Sacramento was third after a 72.

'20 YEARS AFTER': WEAK WOODSTOCK VIBES

<P>
No mud. No traffic jams. No open drug use. No babies born. Certainly no 
copulation. Plenty of bathrooms. No epithets of "pig" directed at the friendly 
policemen strolling through the crowd. Only about half of 1% of the original 
crowd figure. No superstar acts. No climbing on the speaker towers. No illusion 
of unity or purpose or agenda. And no brown acid to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the first day of the "20 Years After" music festival tribute 
Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills was almost exactly like Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: a drum solo for every billed attraction! A grilled chicken booth for 
every pothead! Dozens of tie-dyed T-shirt concessions! Men with hair! Earth 
mamas without bras! Jams without endings! Stage dialogue like: "You people are 
the music; we're just the band right now" (courtesy of Humble Pie)! 
</P>
<P>
And, best of all, emcee and counterculture class bozo Wavy Gravy, trying 
desperately to imbue this most laid-back of daze with some sense of urgency! 
"If you respect our Mother Earth, let's pick up the trash a little bit," he 
pleaded, making the scant littering of the Olympic Velodrome -- pardon us, the 
7-Eleven Olympic Velodrome (yes, the revolution will be sponsored) -- sound 
like the imminent rape of Ma World. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Wavy had a tough time relating to some of the younger, more cynical kids 
in the audience. "I'm a clown," he told them. "You're an acidhead!" some 
whippersnapper shouted back. "No, I'm a clown," he repeated, a bit of resigned 
sadness in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
If there seemed to be a noticeable lack of a Woodstock vibe Saturday among the 
relaxed crowd of fewer than 5,000, it may have been partly because that day's 
bill was devoted mostly to acts that became more famous in the '70s than in the 
'60s, like Edgar Winter and Grand Funk's Mark Farner. There was a Spinal Tap 
appeal to watching semi-reunited war horses like Iron Butterfly and Humble Pie 
go through their '70s chunk-rock paces, in incarnations that combine 
long-in-the-tooth original members with hunky new recruits who look as though 
they were conscripted at the Sports Connection. 
</P>
<P>
Electric Flag was one of the few to reunite all its original personnel (except, 
of course, the late Mike Bloomfield), in this case for the first time in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's bill, which was scheduled to include such memorable Woodstock veterans 
as Country Joe McDonald, Melanie, Canned Heat, Richie Havens and Sha Na Na, was 
expected to draw more of the real Woodstock audience contingent. 
</P>
<P>
"The music has been fine and it's been a good day," said Dawn Souder of 
Pittsburgh, who was operating a tie-dye concession at the rear of the field 
with her husband Eric. "But it doesn't seem like a Woodstock audience. It's 
more like college kids, just kind of a thing to do on a Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the day, as chosen by the Souders and most in attendance, was 
the penultimate set by Leon Russell and Edgar Winter, in which the two keyboard 
veterans fronted a tight band and alternated lead vocals. The crowd went wild 
for Winter's monster instrumental smash, "Frankenstein," which proved still a 
whole lot of hokey fun with Russell's piano providing a rollicking, almost 
boogie-woogie undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the still golden-throated Farner also fared well with the 
audience, mixing early Grand Funk boogie (some kind of dull), mid-period Funk 
pop hits (truly "Some Kind of Wonderful") and his current "God-rock, 
Dee-troit-style" material (some kind of evangelistic). Even his awesomely 
ill-conceived ditty about what a drag it is to go to hell, "Judgment Day 
Blues," was too high-spirited to bring the crowd really dooooown, maaaaaan. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the crowd-pleasing Winter/Russell set, the climactic "Superjam" was 
a fizzle: Croaking "Roadhouse Blues" and "Back Door Man," guitarist Robby 
Krieger solved the big mystery of why he was never the Doors' lead singer, and 
of the other participants -- including Randy California and Tim Bogert -- only 
Ginger Baker (celebrating his 50th birthday) really redeemed himself, turning 
in the sole justifiable drum solo among so many that day. 
</P>
<P>
Popular verdict among the crowd, average age about 30: The 12-hour opening day 
concert seemed well-staged, well-run and, well, fun, but, according to Eric 
Moser, 27, of Mission Viejo, "I think the '60s were better in the '60s."

A RUNYON FOR THE MONEY IN 'LET IT RIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Let It Ride" (citywide) has the makings of a real sleeper. In addition to its 
non-stop hilarity, it has a feel-good, send-'em-home-happy quality that has 
become one of the rarest of screen commodities. 
</P>
<P>
It really is the kind of movie they don't make anymore, on several counts. 
First of all, it's a Runyonesque race-track comedy, a genre one might well have 
thought past reviving. Second, its humor is gentle and unpretentious: There's 
no going for hard, slam-bang yocks or elaborate set-piece catastrophes 
requiring a legion of stunt people. Believe it or not, the abundant humor in 
the sterling screenplay Ernest Morton adapted from Jay Cronley's "Good Vibes" 
actually derives from the foibles of human nature and not from special effects. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dreyfuss may have won an Oscar for his amusingly high-minded New York 
actor in "The Goodbye Girl" and given us plenty of laughs in "Moon Over 
Parador," "Tin Men" and "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," but it's just possible 
he surpasses himself as Trotter, a Miamian who just can't stay away from the 
horses. He is onscreen practically the entire film, and there is a terrific 
momentum he sustains as he roller-coasts between despair and elation. 
Determinedly jaunty -- he prances when he's ecstatic -- he has the kinetic 
energy and fast retorts of James Cagney. 
</P>
<P>
Resolutions are often made to be broken. When, over a Chinese dinner, Trotter 
vows to give up gambling while his adored wife, Pam (Teri Garr), promises to 
make no more scenes, you know this truce isn't going to last beyond the fortune 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"Let It Ride" gets under way -- and never lets up -- once Trotter's 
taxi-driving pal Looney (David Johansen) tapes a back-seat conversation between 
two passengers discussing a fixed race at Hialeah. Trotter goes for it, 
rationalizing that a sure thing doesn't constitute gambling. A couple of plot 
twists and turns later, he seems to be on an incredible winning streak. But 
what if it runs out? 
</P>
<P>
There's a terrific throwaway quality to the gags and the jokes that gives the 
film its blitheness. You're reminded of vintage Hawks and Wilder and Sturges, 
of the Hollywood Golden Era comedies that sparkle timelessly because their 
makers didn't take themselves too seriously, didn't press too hard for laughs, 
but did cook up great lines for their wonderful supporting players. 
</P>
<P>
"Let It Ride" has its own glorious character people. In addition to Garr's 
loving but distraught wife and Johansen's goofy loser, there is, most 
important, Allen Garfield's Jockey Club rich guy with the pneumatic baby-voiced 
mistress (Jennifer Tilly); Robbie Coltrane's sour ticket seller, whose view of 
Trotter moves from contempt to awe, and Michelle Phillips' delicious blonde 
society tramp. (Accepting the offer of a drink from Trotter, she says breezily, 
"Why not? I'm on the pill.") "Let It Ride" looks good in a low-key way, and 
Giorgio Moroder's eclectic, funky mood-setting score is crucial in helping 
maintain tone as well as pace. 
</P>
<P>
In an instance of saving the best for the last, "Let It Ride's" special hero is 
its director, Joe Pytka, making his feature debut after years in documentaries, 
music videos and innovative, prize-winning commercials. He never lets 
archetypes slide into stereotypes or good nature drift into sentimentality, and 
he's never afraid to let Dreyfuss and Garr seem anything less than the very 
bright people they are. "Let It Ride" (rated a rather severe PG-13) plays like 
an All-American, nose-thumbing, warmhearted yet undeniably dark-tinged comedy 
classic.

SUMMERFEST '89 OPENS ON STRONG NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In accord with its high standards, the La Jolla Chamber Music Society opened 
its fourth annual summer festival at Sherwood Auditorium with three rousing 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
SummerFest '89 artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama constructed a pleasantly 
varied program Friday night that opened with a Telemann Trio Sonata in C Minor, 
followed by the Benjamin Britten "Phantasy" Quartet, Op. 2; it closed with 
Brahms' exuberant B-flat Major String Sextet, Op. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Oboist Gerard Reuter, a member of the Dorian Wind Quintet, made a stunning 
first impression in the Telemann and the Britten. One of the few newcomers on 
this program of SummerFest veterans, Reuter proved to be the perfect foil to 
flutist Damian Bursill-Hall in the Trio Sonata. The two wind players traded 
deftly turned and vividly etched lines in a lean but vigorous contrapuntal 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Phantasy" Quartet, Reuter's keen, penetrating timbre cut through the 
delicate string accompaniment without overwhelming it. He responded to the 
composer's dense arabesques with a sensuously shaded cantilena that was nothing 
short of mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
David Golub provided a fleet, vigorous keyboard accompaniment in the Telemann, 
but his aggressive attacks gave him away as a pianist drafted for harpsichord 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Peter Reijto was a trusty collaborator in both the Telemann and the 
Britten, and Eugene Drucker's violin supplied a sweet innocence in the 
"Phantasy" Quartet when it was called for. Violist Cynthia Phelps' dark timbre 
could not have been more apt for the work's pathos. 
</P>
<P>
After the intensity of the program's first half, however, the Brahms Sextet was 
a minor disappointment. It took the better part of the first movement for the 
players to forge a cohesive ensemble, and even then they continued to move in 
and out of focus. The players did not fully encompass this youthful work and 
give it a coherent interpretive stamp, but there were several exquisite 
moments, such as the serene close of the second movement and the vibrant 
scherzo. 
</P>
<P>
First violinist Andres Cardenes' strong, decisive approach was perhaps too 
stern for this optimistic composition, and he remained uncharacteristically 
aloof from his collaborators. Violinist Julie Rosenfeld, violist Francesca 
Martin and cellist Diane Chaplin -- three-quarters of the Colorado Quartet -- 
as well as violist Phelps and cellist Gary Hoffman made up the rest of the 
Brahms ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman handled his virtuoso solos with aplomb and great conviction, but a more 
burnished sonority from his instrument would have better complemented the 
idiom. 
</P>
<P>
The opening-night crowd was almost a full house at the auditorium, which holds 
about 500. The festival continues through Aug. 27.

'HEATHEN VALLEY'S' TRUE TALE OF ASPIRING ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three things to pray for: "A school that teaches, a hospital that heals and a 
church that doesn't presume." 
</P>
<P>
Romulus Linney's "Heathen Valley," in its West Coast premiere at the Grove 
Theatre, concerns a Bishop who brought his flock back to God and decided that 
that wasn't enough -- he would make angels of them. 
</P>
<P>
Result: disaster. For the people in the valley. Not for the Bishop. He had 
moved on by then. 
</P>
<P>
Linney based this 1987 play -- and an earlier novel -- on a true story from his 
native South Carolina. He doesn't tell the story cynically. There's sympathy 
for the Bishop (Dennis Robertson), who believes himself to be a man of 
conscience operating for the good of those entrusted to his care. 
</P>
<P>
He also sees himself as existing on a higher plane than they do. They are 
supporting players in his spiritual drama and they must look the part, even 
dress the part. "God" loves uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
Do all leaders end up confusing themselves with God? We're much more drawn to 
the Bishop's second-in-command, played by Ron Kuhlman. A layman and a sinner, 
he is well aware that human nature is twisty (starting with himself), and he's 
not too sure about the taller tales in the Bible (starting with the virgin 
birth). 
</P>
<P>
Typically, he does the real work of bringing "the heathens" in the valley back 
to the light, largely by applying horse sense to their problems. But he's as 
lost as they are when the Bishop turns his back on the mission. Linney wishes 
that we could get along without the symbolic magic of religion, but suggests 
that we can't. All the more reason to use that magic wisely. 
</P>
<P>
"Heathen Valley" is a platform piece, almost an oratorio. Philip Killian's 
staging is firmly shaped and earnestly spoken. Life in the mountains, whether 
one serves the Lord or the devil, is seen as a serious business. 
</P>
<P>
Due regard is paid to the fact that these are people who speak a kind of 
poetry. Each face instantly creates a rural archetype, yet nobody falls into 
rural cliche. It is sound, honest acting, on a tidy wood-planked set by Thomas 
Buderwitz. 
</P>
<P>
The production is also a bit bland. The voices tend to stay on the same elegiac 
note, with the diction not as sharp as it could be. Scene transitions are 
smoothly blended, rather than being crisply observed. A contour map of the 
performance wouldn't suggest hills and valleys but a contiguous plain. 
</P>
<P>
Too, we'd like more of a sense of the individual face behind the archetype. 
David Officer as the young man who tells the story is much less sure about who 
he's playing than he was in "South Central Rain," and as a result comes off as 
a voice rather than a character. 
</P>
<P>
We instantly see that Kuhlman's lay deacon will keep his pain to himself, while 
Dennis Robertson's bishop will enjoy sharing the fineness of his conscience 
with the world -- but where do we go from there? The only unexpected piece of 
behavior in the play is Kuhlman's sudden demonstration, at a dance, that he's 
the liveliest step-dancer in the room. We need more such surprises. 
</P>
<P>
No complaints about Marte Boyle Slout's midwife, Thor Edgell's mountain man or 
Christina Carlisi's fierce wife, except that we know everything we're going to 
know about them right away. "Heathen Valley" is intelligent, substantial 
theater, but the mystery of human personality -- the reason we can't be 
programmed into angelhood -- isn't felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Wednesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30. (Sept. 10 performance 
at 3 p.m.) Closes Sept. 16. Tickets $10-$20. 12852 Main Street, Garden Grove. 
(714) 636-7213.

The June 3 massacre in Beijing is having lasting effects in Hollywood. An 
agreement between Gibraltar Releasing Corp. and China Film Corp. calling for 
the Cannes Film Festival hit, "Rising Storm," to be the first film released 
simultaneously in the United States and China has been scrapped and locations 
for another Gibraltar film, "Crime Lords," have been shifted from Beijing to 
Taipei and Hong Kong. Director Frankie Schaeffer and "Rising Storm" star Wayne 
Crawford were in Beijing in late May, and departed the country just prior to 
the June 3 government crackdown. "The atmosphere in China was very open and 
very exciting when we left," said Crawford, "but now, China is not the place to 
be working on location for three months." Shauna Snow

Two U.S. congressmen have said a health warning on the dangers of smoking in 
the latest James Bond movie, "Licence to Kill" should appear at the beginning 
of the film, rather than during the final credits, and have said they will ask 
the Federal Trade Commission whether it has the authority to issue rules on 
tobacco advertising in movies. "Many viewers of the film will leave before they 
see a warning in the movie's credits," said Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) and Bob 
Whittaker (R-Kan.) in a letter to Janet D. Steiger, FTC chairwoman. Philip 
Morris had paid $350,000 to the film maker, United Artists, to have a Lark 
cigarette appear in the film, according to congressional testimony. In response 
to concerns from the American Lung Assn., American Heart Assn. and American 
Cancer Society, the Surgeon General's warning about the effect of smoking 
appears during the final credits. Shauna Snow

Stevie Wonder is launching an 18-month campaign to raise funds for the 
construction of homeless shelters across the country and to raise awareness of 
the homeless's plight in the United States. The project, "Every Heart Needs a 
Home," will be launched Nov. 22 with a benefit concert at the Beacon Theater in 
New York, which will be broadcast nationwide on a pay-per-view basis. Wonder's 
performance will be the first in a series of live performances, public service 
announcements and appearances at events such as housing project ground 
breakings. Said Mitch Costanza, executive director of the American Task Force 
for the Homeless, which is working on the campaign with Wonder: "Human dignity 
is not a privilege, it is what every American should expect. . . . Our 
organization joins hands with Stevie Wonder in his effort to accomplish this 
goal." Shauna Snow

Don Henley has a gripe against his ex-band mate, Joe Walsh, who is touring with 
Ringo Starr and performing what Henley describes as "the phony version of 'Life 
in the Fast Lane.' " "I don't know why he feels compelled to do that song," 
Henley told the Baltimore Sun. "Nobody else is doing that kind of thing. I'm 
sort of puzzled as to why he doesn't do one of his own songs. But I never could 
figure the guy out, so why start now?" Henley said he not only sang that Eagles 
classic on the original record, but also wrote "about half of it." Walsh, on 
the other hand, "really didn't have hardly anything to do with it. He wrote the 
little guitar riff that's in the introduction of the song, and that's basically 
all." Shauna Snow

NYRO FIDDLES WITH SLOGANS, BUZZWORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the late '60s and early '70s, Laura Nyro was a Garbo-like figurine, 
caught in a maelstrom of self-obsessed imagery that rode on a helter-skelter 
melange of classic R&amp;B, pop, jazz and show-tune melodies. She was the dark 
urban madonna playing stream-of-consciousness art/soul. Today's Madonna was 
among Nyro's worshipful audience on Friday at the Wiltern Theatre, and the 
object of adoration was a calmer, less melodramatic performer as she followed 
up on her surprising comeback of last year after a decade of performance 
inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
In her new songs, Nyro has replaced a personal mythology with slogans and 
buzzwords about Indian issues, ecology, animal rights and radical feminism. 
Arrangements of her older songs were tailored to avoid the high notes of her 
youth, and her idiosyncratic stops, starts and tempo shifts were smoothed out 
by her crackerjack quartet. But Nyro's vocals are warmer and less strident, and 
when she encored, alone at the piano, with songs from her youth like an 
achingly poignant "Dedicated to the One I Love," one heard the passion and the 
poetry that inspires cults. Nyro appears at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano tonight. CRAIG LEE

Sporting the body that's no doubt inspired its share of health club 
enrollments, Sheena Easton played the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday with an 
hour-plus, high-energy workout of every song she's ever recorded. Or maybe it 
just seemed that way. Easton, of the tautly muscled torso and 
industrial-strength lungs, is an attractively gifted singer with charm to 
spare. But her act still contained a lot of bloat. 
</P>
<P>
While Easton (who also plays the Pacific Amphitheatre on Saturday) can outclass 
many other pop vocalists on emotive, lung-bursting ballads like "I Wouldn't Beg 
for Water" and "For Your Eyes Only," she wasted a lot of time on lightweight 
sweat-inducers like "No Deposit, No Return." Easton sounded best when she stuck 
to fresher fare, such as "Sugar Walls," a song that earned her Tipper Gore's 
brand as a corrupter of youth. "Hey, Dan Quayle's more dangerous to this 
country than I am," Easton chortled Friday. And he probably doesn't look nearly 
as cute in exercise gear. 
</P>

Opening act Atlantic Starr's set was marred by new member Portia Martin. Her 
over-reaching efforts made you long for the more subtle demeanor of Barbara 
Weathers, the singer she recently replaced in the group. CONNIE JOHNSON

NEIL YOUNG RAGES ON, AGELESS AND ANARCHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It's hard to believe Neil Young is now well into his 40s. Cruising through the 
third decade of a prolific career, he rages on as one of the most aggressive, 
anarchic intelligences in pop, and there's a streak of wild boyishness about 
him that makes him ageless. Earthy and wise as Georgia O'Keeffe, rowdy as 
Johnny Rotten, he's a great American artist whose starkly beautiful songs are 
frequently as profound as pop music gets. 
</P>
<P>
At the Greek Theatre on Saturday, Young turned in a solo acoustic set that was 
everything a long-time fan could want: great new songs, old favorites, and an 
encore featuring backup vocals from his old pals David Crosby and Graham Nash. 
Young charmed the audience from the git-go with his winning performing style -- 
he was so damned casual that were it not for his ferocious intensity, you'd 
think you'd stumbled onto an impromptu rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
He's an extremely funny man, very droll and understated, and his low-key 
persona is the perfect counterpoint to his music, which goes after all the big 
issues. Love, death, mother nature, history, time and betrayal -- Young 
wrestles with them all in songs that never fail to shine a light of kindness 
and conscience on the subject at hand. KRISTINE McKENNA

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: INTERNATIONAL FILM SERIES CONTINUES AT MELNITZ THEATER 
</P>

"The Cutting Edge II," a series of distinctive films from Europe, Asia and the 
Soviet Union assembled by the International Film Circuit, continues Tuesday at 
8 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Illyenko's "The Eve of Ivan Kupalo" (1968) was inspired by the same story 
with which Nikolai Gogol launched his career. The Ukrainian Illyenko was the 
cinematographer of Sergei Paradzhanov's lush folk tale "Shadows of Our 
Forgotten Ancestors." His "Eve of Ivan Kupalo" was banned for nearly 20 years, 
reportedly because it failed to show proper regard for the dictates of 
socialist realism. Like the films of Paradzhanov, who had a similarly difficult 
career in pre-glasnost Russia, it is astoundingly sensual and mesmerizing, even 
when it proves elusive to the American viewer. You don't have to be able to 
understand all the nuances of this shimmeringly beautiful film to be enchanted 
by it. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, its basic situation is the same as Paradzhanov's recent "Ashik 
Kerib": a poor young man (Boris Khmelnitsky) pursues a rich man's daughter 
(Larisa Kadochnikova). Sharing that film's visual lushness and poetic elements 
of supernatural and folklore, "The Eve of Ivan Kupalo" is different both in the 
direction its story takes and in the style with which it's told. The film 
quickly develops into a Faustian tale of temptation and redemption and unfolds 
as dynamically as a ballet, in contrast with the exquisite tableaux of 
Paradzhanov. One gorgeous yet deliberately naive image follows another; at one 
point, a dark meadow is suddenly inundated with balls of fire. Most elusive, 
yet certainly dazzling, is Pidorka's climactic journey to Kiev, which becomes 
an Impressionist trek through Ukrainian history. 
</P>
<P>
A presentation of the UCLA Film Archive, "The Cutting Edge II" continues 
Thursday at 8 p.m. with Swiss film maker Clemens Klopfenstein's "Macao, or 
Beyond the Sea" (1988), a jaunty and unexpectedly romantic fantasy. A 
middle-aged Swiss named Max (Max Ruedlinger) boards a plane from Zurich bound 
for Stockholm, then finds himself regaining consciousness after his plane 
crashes inexplicably along the shore of an island off Macao. He and the pilot, 
apparently the only survivors, gradually realize that they cannot leave the 
island or communicate with the outside world. Max's initial resistance to the 
kindly islanders is often comical, but the film, which is as plain as the 
homely Max, develops into a fable of tenderness and poignancy. It also has, of 
all things, a heroine (Christine Lauterberg) yodeling in longing for her 
missing husband. 
</P>
<P>
"Marin Karmitz and MK2," the UCLA Film Archive's tribute to the noted French 
producer and his company, continues Saturday at 8 p.m. in Melnitz Theater with 
Alain Tanner's "No Man's Land" (1985) and a revival of Jean-Luc Godard's "Every 
Man for Himself" (1980). 
</P>
<P>
In the moody "No Man's Land," Tanner focuses on three restless people stuck in 
a remote French provincial village hard by the Swiss border. Paul (Hugues 
Quester) smuggles people and goods across the border but dreams of emigrating 
to Canada. Madeline (Myriam Mezieres) runs a disco but dreams of escaping to 
Paris to become a singer. Louis (Jean-Philippe Ecoffey), a local farm youth, is 
a trained clock maker whose conflicting desires make him the focal character. 
There is virtually no action, but there is plenty of interaction, and Tanner 
makes the beautiful but isolated locale highly expressive of his trapped 
people's thoughts and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
A key film by a major film maker, "Every Man for Himself" is the Godard 
masterwork that marked a second beginning for him. In it, he delineated the 
death of feeling and the flowering of an aggressive self-absorption in 
contemporary life with both amazing beauty and much humor. The Karmitz series 
concludes at 8 p.m. Sunday with "Melo" (1986), Alain Resnais' elegant but 
terrifically demanding film of the 1929 Henry Bernstein play, and "Le Bon 
Plaisir" (1984), a tedious tale about the president of France (Jean-Louis 
Trintignant) and his ex-mistress (Catherine Deneuve) coping with an amateur 
blackmailer.

The season's fifth tropical storm may be born by this morning, a hurricane 
specialist said, as a tropical depression moving west-northwest through the 
open Atlantic gained strength through the night. "The environment is not ideal, 
but we wouldn't be surprised to see it become a tropical storm," said Hal 
Gerrish, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The center of 
the depression was located about 1,400 miles southwest of the Azores, the 
center said. The depression was moving near 20 m.p.h. with maximum sustained 
winds near 35 m.p.h. -- just 4 m.p.h. shy of tropical storm strength. If the 
depression reaches tropical storm strength, it would be named Erin.

VIET WRITER SHOT IN FRESNO TOLD OF DEATH THREATS THREE YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doan Van Toai, the internationally known Vietnamese writer shot as he walked 
through his Fresno neighborhood Saturday, said in an interview three years ago 
that his life had been threatened by anti-Communist extremists. 
</P>
<P>
Toai, who remained in serious condition Sunday at Valley Medical Center in 
Fresno, recently wrote an article sympathetic to the current Vietnam government 
and has long been a controversial figure because of his actions during the 
Vietnam War and his writing since. 
</P>
<P>
Toai's views and anti-war actions in South Vietnam had put him at odds with 
many in Southern California's Vietnamese refugee community. Vietnamese-language 
newspapers wrote editorials against him, while outspoken leaders warned him 
that his views were unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Attacks 
</P>
<P>
The shooting of Toai is the latest of several attacks in California in recent 
years against Vietnamese refugees who advocate that the United States establish 
diplomatic relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Through his books and a magazine, Toai in recent years has advocated restoring 
ties with Vietnam in order to deliver humanitarian aid to the people. In a 1986 
interview with The Times, he said that an article he wrote exposing alleged 
fraud by an anti-Communist group provoked death threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times saying these people who want to 
fight the Communist government are collecting money for that cause but are 
actually using the money for themselves," Toai said then. "The group that I 
wrote about in 1982 was overwhelmingly supported by the refugee community in 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"The group threatened to kill my whole family after the story ran," Toai said. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked through his Fresno neighborhood at 9 a.m. Saturday, witnesses told 
police, a "dirty" brown Pontiac station wagon carrying two Asian men drove by, 
with several shots being fired at Toai. The 42-year-old author was hit three 
times and later underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno Sheriff's Department investigators divulged no new information Sunday 
about the attack, a possible motive or suspects. But Sheriff's Sgt. Oliver Moon 
said Saturday that the victim had not been strong enough to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Nhat Tien, a Santa Ana writer and poet, said Toai recently published a 
Washington magazine, Institute for Democracy in Vietnam, which served as a 
vehicle for expressing his political views on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine's summer 1989 issue, Toai argued in an article that the United 
States should establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, said Tien, who had a 
copy of Toai's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Toai) believes that if there is a relationship with the United States, the 
condition of the poor Vietnamese people would change for the better. He 
believed that if economic conditions improved, the political climate would 
change, much like China," Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wrote many, many articles saying that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Fresno Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Cobbs said there has been no recent 
political firestorms "that I know of" in Fresno's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
In both Fresno, one of the largest Vietnamese resettlement communities in the 
country, and in Orange County's Little Saigon, Toai was far from popular among 
refugees, several community leaders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Fresno, a member of the Vietnamese Assn. of Central Valley said Sunday that 
many people in the refugee community were suspicious of Toai and didn't trust 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Toai, the member said, would make statements that led people to believe he 
really supported the Communists. "He said, 'The Communists do some good things 
for the people of Vietnam.' If they do good things, then why are we here? We 
escaped to come here; no way we can support the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
A prominent member of Fresno's Vietnamese community, who asked not to be 
identified, added: "The Vietnamese community is really talking about this, 
they're not surprised he was shot." 
</P>
<P>
Chuyen V. Nguyen, a former South Vietnamese Air Force pilot who now lives in 
Orange County, recalled that Toai was a member of South Vietnam's educated 
class who led anti-war protests in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a lot of damage to the democracy of Vietnam back home," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Served in Prison 
</P>
<P>
"Even after Toai escaped from some so-called prison in 1977 or 1978, he 
traveled to China with a North Vietnamese official who then opposed the regime 
in North Vietnam. We in the Vietnamese refugee community believe he has close 
ties to Vietnam," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese people here in the U.S. view him as another member of the 
Communist Party. Despite his imprisonment, he was more well-known for leading 
the protests because he had organized a whole bunch of students, some of them 
imitating American students at the time who advocated a 'resist the draft' 
movement," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
"These were educated members of the nation, who didn't want to go out and join 
the military but protested instead. That is why a lot of suspicion surrounds 
Toai," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Toai had been targeted by the right, Nguyen said the shooting might be 
the result of his former activities, which is crucial right now because, he 
said, the Vietnamese government is trying to to reconstruct the country and 
help sway opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Toai has co-authored two books, "The Vietnamese Gulag," and "Portrait of the 
Enemy" with writer David Chanoff. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was shot in Orange 
County's Little Saigon after he was quoted as saying he supported normalizing 
relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was convicted. And on 
April 30, 1988, novelist Long Vu, a well-known Vietnamese author, suffered 
partial paralysis after a severe beating in the same Westminster refugee 
community.

LAPD NAILS 352 IN OPERATION HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Police task force called Operation Hammer arrested 352 people in 
South Los Angeles over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 10th in a series of sweeps this year aimed at reducing gang-related 
street violence. 
</P>
<P>
Special squads, totaling 167 officers working Saturday night and early Sunday, 
arrested 138 people, including 61 gang members. They seized 32 ounces of 
cocaine, 6 1/2 ounces of marijuana and a little more than 8 ounces of other 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Charges included 13 narcotics and 11 other felony violations, as well as 129 
traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night and early Saturday, the task force arrested 133 suspected gang 
members and 81 others not believed to be members. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the sweep was bounded roughly by the Santa Monica Freeway on the 
north, Imperial Highway on the south, the Inglewood city limit on the west and 
Alameda Street on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend sweeps began in early 1988 and were dubbed "The Hammer" by Police 
Chief Daryl Gates, who said the operation was designed to "make life miserable 
for gang members" by arresting them and their associates for both major and 
minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Violence continued in the Southland. A 19-year-old man was killed in Southwest 
Los Angeles Saturday, four people were wounded in a drive-by shooting at 
Averill Park in San Pedro Saturday and another 19-year-old man was shot in the 
leg in a drive-by shooting in Venice early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Southwest Los Angeles, the shooting victim was wounded about 8:40 p.m. 
Saturday in the 4000 block of Leimert Boulevard and died at Brotman Medical 
Center, according to Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mike D'Amato. The victim's name 
was withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Pedro attack, two men, a teen-age boy and a woman who were on the 
south side of Averill Park were hit by shotgun pellets fired from a small car 
about 10:45 p.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Ortega, 18, was reported in serious but stable condition at Torrance 
Memorial Hospital Medical Center with multiple facial wounds. The other 
victims, Juan Gabion, 18; Ernest Gabion, 21, and Adrian Hernandez, 17, were 
reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the victims were not gang members, and police have not determined 
whether the attack is gang-related. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
In Venice, Michael Ridley, 19, was at a party when a car drove past, a gang 
slogan was shouted and five shots were fired about 1:45 a.m., police said. 
Ridley, hit in the leg, was reported in stable condition at UCLA Medical 
Center. No arrests have been made.

VITAMIN FINDINGS REJECTED

Vitamin supplements taken around the time of conception do not reduce the risk 
of having a baby with birth defects in the central nervous system, researchers 
said last week in a study that contradicts a number of previous findings. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies in Britain and the United States showed that mothers of 
malformed infants were less likely to have taken vitamins prior to or just 
after conception than mothers of normal children or infants with other defects. 
But critics have faulted the studies because of the small numbers of women 
involved or design problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, coordinated by the National Institutes of Health, researchers 
compared three groups: 571 women in California and Illinois who had a child 
with a defect of the neural tube, the primitive central nervous system of the 
developing fetus; 546 women who had a child with another defect, and 573 women 
who had a normal infant. All the women were interviewed about their use of 
vitamins within five months of giving birth or the diagnosis of a birth defect. 
The study found that the use of multivitamins did not differ among the three 
groups. It also found that the use of the vitamin folate, which had been shown 
to prevent birth defects, was the same for all the groups.

JAVA MAY HINDER EX-SMOKERS

Researchers at San Francisco General Hospital reported last week that smokers 
who recently kicked the habit may be unusually sensitive to caffeine, 
suggesting that their tendency to be anxious and irritable from nicotine 
withdrawal may be magnified by a cup of java. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Neal Benowitz and his colleagues studied 68 men and women who were going to 
try to quit smoking. The amount of caffeine in the blood of those who stopped 
smoking was more than 2 1/2 times higher after they quit than before, even 
though their caffeine consumption remained the same or even decreased, the 
researchers reported in the British Medical Journal. By comparison, there was 
no change in the amount of caffeine in the blood of those who did not quit, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The tar in cigarette smoke is believed to accelerate the breakdown of a number 
of drugs, including caffeine, said Benowitz, so when someone quits smoking, the 
caffeine may not be broken down as quickly.

DIETING MAY SPARK ANOREXIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An addiction to opiates produced by the brain while dieting may be the cause of 
anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder in which patients starve themselves, 
sometimes to death, Michigan researchers said last week. The scientists say 
their research, presented at the 40th annual meeting of the American Society 
for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, suggested anorexics may have 
"abnormal biological responses" to diet-triggered opiates. 
</P>
<P>
Typically these opiates, called endorphins, produce a "high" and an increased 
appetite. But in anorexia patients, those effects may be out of balance, so 
hunger is overridden by the euphoria, said Wayne State University 
pharmacologist Mary Ann Marrazzi. 
</P>
<P>
In their study, the researchers discovered that some mice demonstrated 
decreased appetite and increased activity when given morphine, an opiate. If a 
person responded similarly to their own opiates, released during dieting, it 
would mimic the behavior of anorexia nervosa patients, she said.

OCEAN ALGAE EXTRACT SHOWS AIDS PROMISE

Researchers from the National Cancer Institute report that four fatty 
substances found in common ocean algae protected cells of the human immune 
system against attack by the AIDS virus. The extracts, called sulfolipids, come 
from the membranes of chlorophyll-containing cells and are found in many 
plants, algae and micro-organisms. Their viral-fighting ability had not been 
known before and was discovered in the cancer institute's program to screen 
substances for potential AIDS-fighting ability, the researchers reported in 
last week's Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The NCI tests could not show how the sulfolipids protected against the human 
immunodeficiency virus, the team said, and compounds with similar chemical 
structures gave no protection against the virus. Because of the urgency for 
identification and testing of new anti-AIDS drugs, the NCI has selected the 
sulfolipid class as a high priority for further investigation, the scientists 
said.

MIKE DOWNEY: THROUGH THE HAZING, ROOKIE QUARTERBACKS TUNE UP FOR COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the older buckaroos on the Dallas Cowboys paused between mouthfuls at 
the training table in Thousand Oaks and barked out orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Aikman! Get up there!" 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hear it!" 
</P>
<P>
Aikman reached down for a ketchup bottle. He held it to his mouth like a mike. 
Then he went into his best Hank Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhh, if heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I don't want to go; 
</P>
<P>
 "If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just as soon stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Cowboys kept on chewing, some not even listening. Aikman just kept 
wailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there ain't no Grand Old Opry 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Nashville, Tennessee 
</P>
<P>
 "Then send me to hell or New York City, 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both the same to me." 
</P>
<P>
The big Cowboy sang until he was a little hoarse. Then he sat back down to his 
meal, to scattered applause. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, same team, same station: 
</P>
<P>
"Walsh!" 
</P>
<P>
Steve Walsh stopped, mid-fork. Put down his utensils. Stood. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hear it!" 
</P>
<P>
Walsh picked up an A-1 steak-sauce bottle. Stuck it up by his mouth. Sang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wastin' away again in Margaritaville, 
</P>
<P>
 "Lookin' for my lost shaker of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say there's a woman to blame, 
</P>
<P>
 "But I knowwww . . . it's my own damn fault." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad, but not exactly Jimmy Buffett. Walsh returned to his food, to mixed 
reviews. He was told not to quit his day job. 
</P>
<P>
Millionaires? All-Americans? Choice draft choices? Quintessential quarterbacks? 
</P>
<P>
So what? To the older dudes among the Cowboys, Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh are 
plain old rookies. Pledges in a frat. Plebes at an academy. Entitled to a 
hazing. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Michael Irvin played with Walsh and for Coach Jimmy Johnson at 
the University of Miami before leaving for the pros a couple of years ahead of 
them. He has no sympathy for these poor singing rooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Went through the same treatment myself," Irvin said after catching Walsh's 
touchdown pass Saturday night in the Cowboys' 27-20 exhibition victory over the 
Raiders at the Coliseum. "They made me get up there and sing, same as every 
other rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"But at least I sang some nice top-20 tune, something that didn't hurt your 
ears. Aikman gets up there and sings that country-western stuff of his." 
</P>
<P>
Was he any good? 
</P>
<P>
"Man, how do I know?" Irvin asked. "It was country western!" 
</P>
<P>
In Cowboy camp these days, heaven looks a lot like Aikman and Walsh. Not many 
teams have two such gifted rookie quarterbacks. (Well, physically gifted, if 
not musically.) Not many teams that wouldn't like to have Aikman, the Okie from 
UCLA, or Walsh, the hurryin' Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
They are taking turns as starters until the coach -- who's also a rookie -- 
makes up his mind. Aikman started the Aug. 12 game at San Diego, won by the 
Cowboys, 20-3. Completed eight of 11. Walsh played the first half against the 
Raiders. Completed 11 of 16. Aikman worked the third quarter: four of 8. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Jimmy Johnson said he didn't know, didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both top of the shelf," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, too, didn't know, didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
"Really doesn't matter which one starts," Irvin said. "We need 'em both. We 
could rotate all year long, be OK with me. Run in one, then the other. Always 
have a fresh one in there." 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Walsh said. "I don't think that's such a hot idea. I don't think 
Coach Johnson believes in that philosophy, either. He had Bernie Kosar and 
Vinnie Testaverde at the same time at Miami and didn't do it. Why would he do 
it in the NFL?" 
</P>
<P>
If it's a predicament, it's a good predicament. Johnson, for one, seems to be 
enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it look like a quarterback competition to you?" Tom Landry's successor 
asked. He had the look of a cat that had just digested a scrumptious order of 
canary and gone back for seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys figure they can't lose, either way. That is, of course, pretty much 
what they did last season -- lose, every which way. 
</P>
<P>
They lost so often that they got to pick first in the college draft. They 
picked Aikman. Then they took Walsh in the supplemental draft. Each has made 
one NFL start so far. Each is 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
How do they look so far? 
</P>
<P>
Fine, which is fine with the guys who catch their passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to Steve on the sidelines," Irvin said, "and he said he was 
having some trouble adjusting, having some trouble getting comfortable with his 
throwing. And I said: 'That never stopped you before! Get in there and throw 
some more! Relax! Have fun!' 
</P>
<P>
"Then, later on, I was talking to Troy on the sidelines. I asked him if he was 
going back in. He said he didn't know. I said: 'Hey! Get in there! I want to go 
deep!' 
</P>
<P>
"Both them guys can get me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Irvin, an equal-opportunity receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the hazing continues. There are no doughnut runs, no towels to pick 
up, not yet. But there is more singing to do. Aikman's already been up three 
times, singing rodeo songs, doing everything but yodeling. Walsh went straight 
from folk to Bob Marley. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Cowboys are keeping their helmets on.

HORSE RACING STRIVES TO CATCH ITS BASEBALL NEIGHBOR

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From its start, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was a hit. The 
operators scheduled an inaugural induction ceremony that included appearances 
by Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson and Honus Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame in tiny (population: 2,300) Cooperstown, N.Y., took that 
beginning in 1939 and has built on it since. The tendency is to refer to the 
town as out-of-the-way Cooperstown, but more than 300,000 visited the museum 
last year, and last month a crowd of more than 20,000 showed up for the 
inductions of Carl Yastrzemski, Johnny Bench and Red Schoendienst. 
</P>
<P>
The National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, less than a furlong away from 
the Saratoga Race Track here, is something else. This museum, to say the least, 
was slow getting out of the starting gate, and it wasn't until last year, when 
a $6-million renovation was completed, that the Hall of Fame joined the 20th 
Century. Before that, the place could have been mistaken for a mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
A sports fan whose persuasions run to both baseball and racing has good reason 
to visit Cooperstown and Saratoga Springs, because one is a two-hour drive from 
the other. Saratoga Springs (population: 23,000) is a 3 1/2-hour drive from New 
York. The central airport for Cooperstown and Saratoga Springs is in the state 
capital of Albany, which is about 60 miles east of Cooperstown and 25 miles 
southeast of Saratoga Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the racing museum might have been shamed into upgrading their 
facility because of the continued popularity of the nearby baseball shrine and 
because Churchill Downs introduced its $7.5-million Kentucky Derby Museum a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Derby museum is still the best racing has and draws about 120,000 fans a 
year, more than double the annual attendance at its Saratoga counterpart. In 
fact, the Travers Stakes, the showcase race of the monthlong Saratoga season, 
has sometimes attracted more fans than the racing museum has drawn in an entire 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney Tower, the new president of the racing museum, is related to the 
Whitney family, which has raced horses for generations. Tower is former turf 
writer for Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Unabashedly, the racing museum has borrowed some of the best elements from both 
Cooperstown and Churchill Downs. There is a theater, surrounded by walls 
displaying the plaques of the Hall of Fame inductees, that features "Racing 
America," a 15-minute split-screen panorama directed by Keith Cheetham. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can listen, via telephone, to Angel Cordero explain the art of race 
riding or hear Wayne Lukas talk about training and how he picks the horses for 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
The phones for Lukas and other trainers are on a fence next to a full-scale 
replica of a section of trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
There are 10 galleries in the museum. The one that covers the most ground is in 
the theater, where six computer terminals can provide a glimpse of the career 
of any horse, jockey or trainer who has been enshrined. Yes, Bill Shoemaker 
still gets Forego to the wire in that memorable New York race in which it 
always seems that the late-running gelding won't reach the finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Shoemaker, there seems to be little in evidence here of the 
legendary jockey, who was inducted into the hall in 1958 -- three years after 
the first group. Perhaps the museum will do better by Shoemaker after his 
retirement early next year. 
</P>
<P>
While Cooperstown can offer Lou Brock's shoes, worn the day he stole his record 
893rd base, Saratoga has Eddie Arcaro's boots. Stan Musial's locker can be 
found in Cooperstown, Angel Cordero's at Saratoga. Cy Young, who won 511 games, 
had an Ohio license plate in 1954 that read "C-511-Y"; the late trainer, Sunny 
Jim Fitzsimmons, timed his horses with a diamond-studded stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
While racing's museum was being improved, baseball was spending $6 million on 
the Fetzer-Yawkey Building (named after the owners of the Detroit Tigers and 
Boston Red Sox), which includes a 15-minute multimedia show in a 
three-dimensional, make-believe ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's museum will probably always be better because it has so much money 
to spend. The annual budget is $3 million, more than half coming from gift-shop 
and catalogue sales. After that rebuilding expense of $6 million, racing is 
cantering along on an estimated $650,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Racing has a gift shop, too. A three-foot-high concrete jockey sells for $950; 
a laminated front page from the Daily Racing Form on the day Affirmed beat 
Alydar in the Kentucky Derby sells for $95. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Paul Mellon, philanthropist and breeder and owner of horses, was 
browsing in the gift shop. Mellon may have been the largest single contributor 
to the renovation fund, providing $369,000 and loaning the museum many 
paintings from his extensive collection. 
</P>
<P>
Mellon left, however, without making a purchase. Two of his horses were about 
to win back-to-back races at the track across the street.

AOUITA EASILY BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN 3,000 METERS

<P>
Said Aouita of Morocco broke the oldest major running-event world record with a 
time of 7 minutes 29.45 seconds in the men's 3,000 meters at a Grand Prix track 
and field meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Rono of Kenya had set the manually timed record of 7:32.1 on June 27, 
1978, at Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest of all world records to get," said Aouita, who also holds 
world records in the 1,500, 2,000 and 5,000, meters, as well as a world best in 
the rarely run two-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted another world record. Three days ago, when I registered for the 
event, I knew I was going to win and set a world record." 
</P>
<P>
Aouita took over the lead with two laps to go, when pacesetter Charles 
Cheruiyot of Kenya dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Yobes Ondieki of Kenya tried to follow Aouita, but the Moroccan ran the last 
lap by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I have gotten closer and closer to it (the record), but when I was 
younger I wasn't so worried because I had time," Aouita, 29, said. "Now I'm 
getting older. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the track here. It's very fast and the pacemakers did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Aouita ran 7:32.23 at the same meet in 1986. That had been the second-fastest 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The only individual world record older than Rono's is in a field event -- Bob 
Beamon's long jump of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches set at the 1968 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Rono, who set four world records within a 90-day span in 1978, no longer holds 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union barely missed breaking 
countryman Sergei Bubka's world pole vault record of 19-10 1/2. In his third 
attempt at 19-11, Gataullin appeared to have the necessary height, but toppled 
the bar with his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Butch Reynolds of the United States, the world record-holder, won the 400 
meters in 44.30, the second-fastest time of the year.

NEWSWIRE: NETS EXPECTED TO NAME FITCH AS COACH TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Fitch is expected to be named coach of the New Jersey Nets today when the 
team holds a news conference in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Net President Bernie Mann said Sunday night that Fitch was the first choice but 
added that he has not been told the final choice. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Harry Weltman and Fitch could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch, 55, has been the leading contender to become coach since Willis Reed 10 
days ago accepted a job as New Jersey vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch, who has a 762-714 record in 18 seasons in the National Basketball Assn., 
had some of his best years in helping the Houston Rockets mature. He was fired 
by the Rockets after the 1987-88 season, his fifth with the club.

DESPITE NEW LAWS, U.S. STILL A LURE IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although most Mexicans believe new U.S. immigration laws have made it more 
difficult to find work in the United States, more than 4.7 million Mexican 
citizens believe they are very likely to move north in the next year, according 
to a Los Angeles Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to know how many will actually emigrate, but according to the 
poll, 1.3 million would go to California and 800,000 of those would choose to 
look for work in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Bustamante, a Mexican immigration expert and president of Tijuana's 
Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said the numbers reflect "wishful thinking" 
rather than reality. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about attitudes, not real behavior. That may be how many people 
would go if you assume that it is easy, but not when you know that what it 
takes to get to the United States is increasingly expensive and difficult," he 
said. "A lot of those who say they are going may not make it." 
</P>
<P>
Bustamante estimates that there are now 1.75 million Mexicans living illegally 
in the United States, about the same number as last year, before new U.S. 
immigration reform laws went into effect. But U.S. officials disagree, saying 
illegal immigration appears to have declined. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Mexicans believe that the landmark agreement between their 
government and foreign banks to reduce the foreign debt burden will improve the 
country's stagnant economy, the poll found, but they are skeptical that they 
will feel the effects personally. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they say, the country has become so impoverished that half of all 
Mexican children may suffer from hunger. Asked if their friends' and neighbors' 
children have enough to eat, 53% of the respondents said "no" and, among the 
poor, 69% said the children are sometimes hungry. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 Mexicans were interviewed on a wide range of political and 
economic issues from Aug. 5-13. Times poll director I. A. Lewis said the 
nationwide survey has a margin of error of three percentage points in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joblessness, Debt Cited 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment and the foreign debt are the top problems facing the country, most 
of those questioned said. But while President Carlos Salinas de Gortari blames 
debt and low international oil prices for the nation's economic ills, most 
Mexicans blame the crisis on governmental corruption and on the policies of the 
previous administration of President Miguel de la Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas was budget and planning secretary in that administration, and during 
the campaign last year, voters apparently held him responsible for six years of 
economic stagnation and a 50% drop in real wages. Salinas won with 50.4% of the 
official vote count in the presidential election, the lowest winning margin for 
a candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in the six decades that it 
has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexicans have ceased to identify Salinas with the last administration, the 
poll found. Now, three-fourths of those interviewed said they generally approve 
of his handling of the economy, although they do not agree with all of his 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, more than half said that Salinas should continue to encourage 
foreign investment in Mexico, an idea that once was a political taboo in the 
highly nationalistic country; but two-thirds of all Mexicans object to the 
government's sale of state-owned companies. Surprisingly, that number was 
higher among the wealthy classes who normally tend to support free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of the wealthy said they are better off today than they were 
six years ago, whereas 37% of the lower class said they are getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations about the economy also vary dramatically between rich and poor. 
Seventy-three percent of the wealthy expect their financial situation to 
improve by the end of Salinas' term in 1994, whereas only 31% of the poor 
believe that they will be better off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Escape Valve 
</P>
<P>
The United States remains an economic escape valve. Almost 6% of those 
responding to the poll said they were "very likely" to take up residence in the 
United States within the next year. In a country of about 85 million people, 
that is the equivalent of more than 4.7 million would-be emigrants. Another 16% 
said they were "fairly" likely to move north within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked where they would go if they had to leave Mexico, 31% of those interviewed 
pointed north, and the same percentage insisted that they would not abandon 
Mexico under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of those interviewed said they had already visited the United 
States, and 42% said they have relatives living there. But only 7% said they or 
someone in their household receives financial support from relatives in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
New U.S. laws that imposed sanctions on the employers of illegal aliens have 
discouraged illegal immigration, 62% of those interviewed said. Sixty percent 
said they believed that it is now harder to find work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although 22% of those interviewed said they may take up residence in the United 
States within the next year, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg, a 
supervisor for the San Diego sector, was encouraged by the perception that it 
is more difficult to find work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An 'Economic Push' 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the laws change on this side of the border, there is still an 
economic push in those countries (such as Mexico), but it's a beginning. If 
only one in five want to come, that's a good deterrent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said that detentions in the San Diego sector, the busiest area along the 
border, have dropped from a high of 629,656 in fiscal year 1986 to 431,592 last 
year. He said that 309,000 have been detained this fiscal year, which ends in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg noted that part of the drop may be due to the legalization of about 3 
million immigrants who now may go back and forth across the border legally. 
</P>
<P>
But Bustamante charges that the Immigration and Naturalization Service tinkered 
with its figures by stepping up patrols before the immigration legislation was 
passed by Congress and reducing enforcement since the law went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Significant Difference' 
</P>
<P>
"They manipulate the number of hours they dedicate to apprehensions. There is 
no significant difference between the numbers (of illegal immigrants) last year 
and this year," Bustamante said. 
</P>
<P>
In the poll, 23% of those who said they were in some degree likely to move to 
the United States picked California as their destination, and 14% specifically 
chose Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Those polled said they like the culture (18%), democratic tradition (17%) and 
equality (12%) in the United States, but above all, they said they like the 
"economic opportunity" (41%). Sixteen percent said they liked the fact that it 
is a rich country. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what they dislike about the United States, many responded that the 
country is "domineering" (24%), "patronizing" (22%) and that there is 
"discrimination" (38%). But 42% said what they disliked was the extent of the 
drug problem in their neighbor to the north.

FORBES DAZZLES A WHO'S WHO OF AMERICANS

TANGIER, Morocco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There they were -- Liz and Malcolm -- together under the stars on a moonlit 
night, listening to Bolero as fireworks exploded high over Arabian tents and 
out into the glistening Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythmic music and the dazzling fireworks climaxed together, each reaching 
a crescendo and abruptly ending in unison to the cheers of another 1,000 people 
whom publisher Malcolm Forbes had invited along with his date, Elizabeth 
Taylor, to celebrate his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Liz and Malcolm were what the guests had come to see -- together with his 
gleaming-white Moroccan palace (Palais Mendoub) and, actually, each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Politicians 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity guests included opera star Beverly Sills (she sang "Happy Birthday"), 
Henry Kissinger, Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
There were hardly any politicians, but California's Gov. George Deukmejian was 
one, apparently because Forbes likes his fiscal conservatism. Republican Gov. 
Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey -- Forbes' home state -- also was there. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, however, the guest list read like a who's who of corporate 
America -- Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, General Motors Chairman Roger B. 
Smith and hundreds of other business and financial executives -- and clearly 
represented an effort to attract advertising to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all friends," Forbes said of his guests, "and some of them have 
proven it by the amount of business they have put into Forbes magazine." 
</P>
<P>
And to his guests as he and Liz were about to cut the huge four-layer birthday 
cake around midnight Saturday, Forbes acknowledged: "If it hadn't been my 
birthday we would have thought of a different reason (to party). The birthday 
was incidental." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier generation, another publisher -- William Randolph Hearst -- used 
to invite celebrities from Hollywood up to his "ranch" at San Simeon. They 
would arrive by the scores in automobiles or in trains and spend the weekend 
with Hearst and his celebrity girlfriend, Marion Davies, at La Casa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
In the jet age, the publishing world's biggest party-giver is Forbes. And for 
this soiree he flew most of the guests at his expense in three chartered jets 
-- including a Concorde -- across the Atlantic to party with him and Liz. He 
put everybody up at two seaside hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the chartered planes alone was around $1 million, according to one 
Forbes official: $500,000 for the Concorde, $300,000 for a 747 and $200,000 for 
a DC-8. 
</P>
<P>
But Forbes told reporters he doubted the party's tab would reach the $2-million 
figure that has been estimated because things are cheaper in Morocco and also 
because Morocco's King Hassan II -- who threw a lavish farewell lunch and 
picnic for the entire group on Sunday at the Tangier Country Club -- supplied 
all of the music and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the cost will be written off as a business expense and become a Forbes 
tax deduction -- meaning that American taxpayers will wind up subsidizing a lot 
of the fun for these rich party-goers. "I wish it was entirely," Forbes replied 
when asked whether he considered the party a business expense. "Some of it is." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Forbes said he did not feel the slightest bit guilty about spending 
all that money on one extravagant party. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me, 'How do you defend it?' " Forbes said. "It's difficult. You 
can point out that we give several million dollars a year to philanthropies and 
worthy causes. But that doesn't explain why we didn't use all this money for 
the same thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody here," he told the reporters, "who doesn't, maybe, on their 
wife's birthday take her to the theater or dinner or something and do you say 
to yourself, 'Gee, instead of that, I should have given it to the local chapter 
of the Red Cross.' We all do things in our lives that probably aren't 
essential. It's just that this scale is more visible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel guilty about it. I feel grateful that we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes -- who has named his private jet Capitalist Tool and painted its tail 
what he calls "money green" -- inherited a fortune from his self-made father, 
B.C. Forbes, who founded the magazine. But Malcolm has multiplied that fortune 
many times over and now is worth "somewhere between half a billion and a 
billion," said Forbes communication director William Donald Garson. "Honestly, 
he doesn't know what he is worth." 
</P>
<P>
A flamboyant motorcyclist and hot air balloon enthusiast -- "It's very hard to 
be anonymous when you're flying a Sphinx balloon over Cairo," he noted Saturday 
-- Forbes entered Elizabeth Taylor's life two years ago when he handed her a 
$1-million check to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Liz gave him for his birthday, the divorced Forbes said, "I am not 
telling, as a matter of fact." But then he paused for a second and added: "One 
of the things she gave me was Elizabeth Taylor's passion for me." 
</P>
<P>
He described their relationship as "happy," but said the actress should not be 
considered his "fiancee. We have finessed around that. . . . You don't have to 
marry somebody before you have fun together. . . . She's got wit and wisdom and 
love." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said he threw the party because "I just wasn't that confident I would be 
here or, if here, capable of enjoying my 100th. So I decided to have it on the 
70th." 
</P>
<P>
"I know they'll top it on his 75th," said Kissinger, who has been to a few gala 
affairs himself, "but for now, it has to be the most unusual party I have 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Once-in-a-Lifetime' 
</P>
<P>
Said Deukmejian, who is not much of a party-goer but echoed the sentiments of 
most guests: "There's no question it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience." 
</P>
<P>
You know you've been to something special when they have designer outdoor 
toilets that flush. The toilets -- five of them designed locally by a food 
caterer -- had His and Her enclosed stalls under a small Arabian tent with 
black and white tile floors and a sink. (But they had one common problem of 
most outdoor heads: no towels, so people used soggy toilet paper to wipe their 
hands.) 
</P>
<P>
This is a little of what it was like to attend Malcolm Forbes' three-day 
"Ali-Dada Birthday Bash." (A play on the name Ali-Baba): 
</P>
<P>
For ordinary guests -- the Kissingers, the Betsy Bloomingdales, the Cronkites, 
the Deukmejians and folks even more ordinary than that -- it was an early 
wake-up Friday for arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
There also was another, much smaller category of guests who used their own jets 
-- people like Chrysler's Iacocca and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner. 
These people had more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
For an example, financier Henry Kravis and his wife, fashion designer Carolyne 
Roehm, planned to have their private jet meet them Sunday in Tangier so they 
could take another couple to dinner in Venice en route to the Salzburg Music 
Festival, the next stop on their summer fun calendar of social globe trotters. 
</P>
<P>
There were other twists, too, in individual travel arrangements. Publisher 
Rupert Murdoch, for instance, chartered a yacht and brought it to Tangier so he 
could host a Saturday luncheon for roughly 100 select guests, including 
Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
But for about 600 people, the weekend began shortly after dawn Friday with a 
crush of limousines and taxicabs -- family sedans were scarce -- outside a 
private hangar at JFK. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the confusion of hundreds of people trying to check in and dump off their 
bags, the partying began with the chanting of Moroccan musicians shaking 
tambourines and other instruments. Then came a belly-dancer in a tight-fitting, 
low-cut dress. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, sitting at a table under a tent right in front of the dancer, shook 
his head to the rhythm, stretched out his arms and snapped his fingers. "I do 
this every morning at 8:30," he told a reporter, smiling. In a few minutes, the 
governor -- grinning ear to ear -- stood briefly near the woman and began 
dancing himself, twisting and turning and clicking the fingers. 
</P>
<P>
After an elaborate continental breakfast prepared by caterer Basil Rathbone -- 
granddaughter of the late film star Basil Rathbone -- Deukmejian and 99 other 
passengers boarded the Concorde. The sleek, narrow craft flew at twice the 
speed of sound, cruising at around 50,000 feet, and arrived at Tangier on the 
northwestern tip of Africa, just opposite Gibraltar, in three hours, 20 minutes 
-- about half the normal time. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Moroccan musicians greeted guests aboard all three chartered jets 
at the airport. And thousands of curious citizens lined the streets into town 
to catch a glimpse of the rich Americans. More musicians entertained at the 
hotel -- and virtually every place the guests traveled throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and his wife spent part of Saturday shopping in the famed Kasbahs, 
but didn't buy anything. "We were trying to keep up with our guide. We didn't 
want to get lost in that maze," said Gloria Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was hot and humid. The hotel rooms had no air-conditioning and 
everybody was sweating -- except, strangely, at the birthday party where guests 
wearing the required tuxedoes and formals were spared by a cool, gentle breeze 
that blew off the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"The party works better in Morocco -- there's a romance and mystique about 
being far from home," noted advice columnist Abigail Van Buren. "It's 
glamorous, it's spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of white-robed musicians and green-capped Royal Calvary guards wearing 
turbans met guests outside the palace. Then the guests drew their dinner 
seating assignments from a brass bowl. Deukmejian sat in the "Money Green" 
tent, one of seven Arabian tents erected on the terrace gardens overlooking the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, wearing green Scottish kilts, stood in the reception line with his four 
sons and one daughter for more than two hours greeting the steady stream of 
guests. Many people, after having gone through the line themselves, just stood 
around and ogled the other guests. 
</P>
<P>
This was especially true when Elizabeth Taylor stood beside Forbes, which was 
most of the time. She wore a floor-length emerald green caftan with gold 
metallic braiding and long diamond and ruby earrings. Her hairdo could be best 
described as free-form and she again seemed to be losing her battle against 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner -- pastilla (pigeon pie), barbecued lamb, chicken and fruits -- 
lasted until nearly midnight. And guests didn't begin leaving until after 1 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it now," a man said to nobody in particular as one of the chartered 
buses pulled away from the palace. "You'll never see it again."

THE OIL SPILL 5 MONTHS LATER; 
</P>
<P>
ALASKA'S WOUNDS APPEAR TO BE SLOWLY ON THE MEND

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months ago, Prince William Sound was a caldron awash with nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil from the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Its blackened shores were littered with dead and dying birds. Eventually 30,000 
sea birds and 127 bald eagles died. At least a thousand otters were dying of 
hypothermia as oil matted down the luxuriant hair that insulates them from the 
icy waters, or of acute poisoning after ingesting the oil as they groomed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that picture may be changing for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Tidal action and strong currents have swept the waters free of most surface 
oil, which is good news for the birds and otters. 
</P>
<P>
There are strong indications that concentrations of oil mixed in the water 
itself may be negligible, which would be good news for fish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point where we've seen all the acute effects," said Parmely (Hap) 
Prichard of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, Alaska remains a Paradise Lost. 
</P>
<P>
On more than 1,300 miles around Prince William Sound, the Gulf of Alaska, the 
lower Cook Inlet and parts of Kodiak Island, black stains mark the high tide 
line like a bathtub ring. 
</P>
<P>
Oily residue stubbornly clings to rocks and boulders, even on beaches cleaned 
by Exxon, which marshaled a small navy and 11,000 cleanup workers at a cost 
expected to reach $1.2 billion. Pockets of crude are as easy to find as kicking 
over a rock or slipping a hand into a crevasse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely not restored to its original condition and to tell you the 
truth, we'll never get it back to its original state until nature does its 
work," said Cmdr. Gary Reiter of the U.S. Coast Guard, which oversees Exxon's 
cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
On five islands in Prince William Sound that are prime nesting areas for bald 
eagles, not a single bald eagle chick was born this year, a U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service survey found. On Knight Island, all but 11 of 118 nests were 
barren. On Naked Island, all but two out of 20 were empty. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the sea lions we used to see. The sea otters are a lot fewer -- 
which I'm happy about," said Al Johnson of Homer Ocean Charters, who, like most 
fishermen, considers otters a nuisance and competitors for his catch. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also worry about the toll to marine life over the long haul from 
chronic exposure to relatively low levels of toxic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows, for example, what will happen to the state's economically vital 
salmon and herring fisheries. Millions of salmon fry were released shortly 
after the spill. Only when they return home to spawn over the next several 
years will experts know how well the fish survived the apocalypse. Most of the 
salmon season was shut down this year. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Everett McGehee ventured: "We really think from the information 
in our studies that fish have not been affected to any large (degree)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sketchiest Idea 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at this point have only the sketchiest idea of the oil's impact on 
other marine life. Much will depend on the amount of oily contaminants that 
have found their way into the sediments on the ocean floor and intertidal areas 
-- either from the cleanup operations or natural runoff and tidal action -- 
where varieties of marine life live, including sea worms, crabs and clams. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that the oil struck capriciously, hitting some areas hard 
while bypassing others. Some clam beds have been devastated by the spill and it 
will probably be years before they recover. Only now, for example, are clam 
beds hit by the catastrophic 1964 earthquake returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"The shoreline dropped from inches to feet and in some of the places where 
shoreline dropped several feet or more we're just now starting to see the 
animals resettle those areas," said biologist Jim Hemming of Dames &amp; Moore, 
a Los Angeles-based engineering and environmental consulting firm under 
contract to Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "Some shorelines are just horrible (as a result of the spill). There 
are oil deposits in the sediments and lots of oil on the surface," said chief 
scientist Erich Gundlach of the Alaska Department of Environmental 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Hemming added: "There's no question that on heavily oiled shorelines especially 
there's obvious mortality. Our big interest in those cases is how long does it 
take to recover." Researchers are also interested in learning whether recovery 
takes even longer after shoreline cleaning has driven contaminated sediments 
deeper into intertidal areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected to Die 
</P>
<P>
More bald eagles are expected to die in the months ahead after the salmon runs 
end and eagles resume preying on sea birds that may continue to get mired in 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they are lightly oiled, the eagle can spot a (stressed) bird quicker 
than you can spot a Model-T in a parking lot full of Cadillacs. When that 
happens he's going to go down and pick it up. That's why the eagles got into 
trouble this year," said Jim Scott, an Anchorage veterinarian and an authority 
on bald eagles and other birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to fight problems from this for a long time," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
But, there are encouraging signs. 
</P>
<P>
For the oiled otters that survived the first two weeks of trauma, the prognosis 
is good. By the end of this month, all of the remaining 25 captured otters in 
Valdez will be returned to the wild. Those that have been released are doing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"They're swimming really well," said Randall Davis of the Sea World Research 
Institute in San Diego, who led the otter recovery effort here that so far has 
cost Exxon $14 million. That works out to $40,000 for each of the 350 animals 
picked up and treated. Some 922 dead otters were recovered, a number believed 
to represent a small percentage of those actually killed. The otter population 
in the Sound is estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Early fears have proven unfounded that captured otters would be tamed, and when 
released back to the wild would endanger themselves by swimming too close to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all concerned. We thought they would be fat and lazy. But they're 
diving and retrieving their own food. They seem to be acting in every way like 
(wild) sea otters," said Terrie Williams, a research physiologist working with 
Davis in the recovery effort. She added that the otters, some of which have 
been fitted with radio transmitters, are avoiding boats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Unknown 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, like other scientists, said much remains unknown. "There may be 
long-term effects. Oil is toxic at high concentrations. It is carcinogenic at 
lower concentrations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
How quickly the environment recovers will depend in large part on whether oil 
continues to find its way into sediments. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that very little of the oil sank during the early part of the spill," 
said Jacqueline Michel, a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's scientific support team at Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
But she said there is a "big concern" that as the winter storms arrive and 
runoffs from streams and rivers into Prince William Sound pick up, they will 
carry oily particles still on the shoreline into the intertidal zone -- the 
area between high and low tides -- and to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
Of greatest concern are the bays and inlets that are protected from the brunt 
of the storms because the contaminated sediments would be less likely to be 
dispersed once they settle. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic compounds attached to sediments could pose a long-term risk to crabs, 
lobsters and clams, as well as pink and chum salmon which in their early stages 
of development feed off tiny bottom-dwelling shrimp-like creatures and other 
crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from other spills points to chromosomal damage, resulting in 
mutations. Reproduction can be damaged as well. Petroleum compounds and whole 
oils are known to interfere with fish and bird eggs at very low concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon plans to shut down cleanup operations Sept. 15 for the winter, when 
weather and storm conditions would make the efforts dangerous, leaving behind a 
small crew to handle any cleanup emergencies. The oil company, which hopes 
Alaska's fierce winter storms will scour the shoreline, has promised that it 
will return next year to finish the job if so directed by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
But, there appears to be mounting scientific evidence for not resuming certain 
kinds of cleanup methods, especially those involving the use of high pressure 
hoses to direct streams of 140-degree water at oily shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shorelines Sterilized 
</P>
<P>
Government scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NOAA and 
the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said the tactic has 
sterilized shorelines, killing microorganisms. The hosing of all kinds has also 
also washed toxic oily sediments further into intertidal zones, upsetting the 
natural biosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears now after the cleaning occurred there's a substantial change for 
the worse," ventured David Kennedy, scientific support coordinator in Valdez 
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing large plumes of sediment redeposited in sub-tidal (below the low 
tide line) areas. You can't help but have some negative impact," he said. NOAA 
is an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup has spawned a number of other environmental problems as well. The 
oily waste and debris that has been collected has itself become a controversy. 
Exxon has imported incinerators to burn the waste. Other wastes have been 
shipped out of state, a fact that has underscored the point that Alaska has 
been ill equipped to deal with toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy also continues over the use of kerosene-based oil dispersant, known 
as Corexit 9580, on shore to break up thick layers of oil. Until now, the use 
of such dispersants has been restricted to the open ocean because of their 
toxicity. NOAA and the state have recommended against its further use. Exxon 
used it on three sites on Smith Island covering 25,000 square feet of beach. 
But, the state said it thinned the oil so well that it flowed into the water 
and could not be skimmed, while also loading more toxics into the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are promising signs that nature may succeed where Exxon has 
failed, especially if it is given a boost. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has endorsed a so-called "bioremediation" effort in which fertilizer is 
applied to oiled shorelines to speed the growth of oil eating bacteria, which 
are naturally present. The fertilizers of nitrogen and phosphorus help the 
bacteria more readily synthesize the carbon found in the oil. The bacteria 
consume 50% to 60% of the carbon and leave a relatively nontoxic asphalt 
residue behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camp David Dinner 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly is so enthused he recounted a dinner 
recently at Camp David with President Bush and quoted the President as having 
asked: "Bill, are those bugs eating as fast and as much as you hoped?" 
</P>
<P>
They are. Instead of taking upwards of 10 years to rid the shorelines of the 
oil's most toxic components, it may take just three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks promising. Our scientists are encouraged," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real beauty of this is we have so much natural degradation of oil. A lot 
of us didn't expect that," Prichard said. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria can easily get to all the nooks and crannies that Exxon missed. 
Prichard of the EPA said that only 17% of the oil has been removed from 
shorelines by physical processes. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a slight increase in algae after two weeks from the nutrients in 
the fertilizers, but the increase is not significant, according to Fran Kremer, 
a senior environmental engineer with the EPA who has been monitoring test plots 
on several Prince William Sound islands. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the chance of oxygen-depleting algae blooms in the water, the 
bioremediation technique is not permitted in areas where flushing by currents 
is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other drawback. Bioremediation is less effective on heavily oiled 
shorelines because the bacteria are active only on the surface of the oil where 
oxygen and water are present. 
</P>
<P>
In a real sense, the cleanup operation is writing the book on how to respond to 
massive spills in Arctic waters. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the spill Exxon rushed in scientific teams to strategic 
points along the Alaskan shoreline to grab samples of water and marine life 
before the oil arrived. The information is being used as a starting point to 
determine the impacts after the oil hit those same areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now we've had a fair number of spills. But we've never been able to 
tool up fast enough to study them and learn from them. Fortunately on this one 
we got out early enough to start getting some answers," Hemming said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kelp Growth 
</P>
<P>
Based on the "before and after" samples taken here, Hemming said there is 
evidence that the growth of kelp has been retarded by the spill. But no firm 
conclusions can be made yet. He said last year's unusually severe Alaskan 
winter may also be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also learned how much oil it takes to kill an otter from damage 
to the mammal's lungs, liver and other internal organs. Otters with hydrocarbon 
concentrations in their blood of more than 200 parts per million eventually 
died. Those with less than 200 p.p.m, lived. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two weeks were critical to an effective response. Unless something 
is in place, your (rescue) effort is blunted," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
But, it is a hard way to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it's going to occur again. We saw it this summer with three other 
spills," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to stay mad. They need to be reminded how chaotic it was here. 
They need to be ready. We need to keep the presure up. They need to change 
things or we're going to see it all over again," Williams said.

OFFERS TO FREE HOSTAGES SENT, HEZBOLLAH SAYS 
</P>

The kidnapers of the American hostages in Lebanon have forwarded proposals for 
their release to U.S. officials, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement 
was quoted as saying in an interview published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah gave no details of the proposals and said no 
negotiations had started, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"What has taken place so far is that mediators have presented ideas to the 
United States according to proposals put forward by the kidnapers," said 
Fadlallah, who has insisted in the past that his militantly fundamentalist 
organization has no contact with the kidnapers and knows nothing about the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In another Sunday development, a pro-Iranian group said that it would consider 
killing its two American hostages if the French navy intervenes in Lebanon, the 
Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim group, which calls itself the Revolutionary Justice 
Organization, made the threat in a statement delivered to the independent 
newspaper An Nahar and a Western news agency in Beirut, the AP said. The 
statement was accompanied by a photocopy of a photograph that the group 
released Aug. 1 of American hostage Edward A. Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
The group, one of several Lebanese Hezbollah factions believed to hold 
foreigners captive, also holds American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio. It recently 
threatened to kill Cicippio unless Israel released Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a 
Shiite Muslim clergyman and regional Hezbollah leader it kidnaped in southern 
Lebanon. The group later suspended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"America, which is spurring France, should realize that any foolhardiness by 
the French fleet will expose the life of its hostages to danger," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Intention of Intervening 
</P>
<P>
France has sent an aircraft carrier and escort ships to the eastern 
Mediterranean, reportedly to evacuate 7,000 French nationals from war-battered 
Lebanon if the need arises, and President Francois Mitterrand said Sunday that 
his nation has no intention of intervening in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the United States and France on Lebanon policy has led to 
earlier attacks by Shiite extremists. Within five minutes of the 1983 U.S. 
Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which killed 241 American military 
personnel, a battalion compound of the French contingent of a multinational 
force was also hit by a suicide bomber, killing 58. 
</P>
<P>
The reported comments by Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of 
God, were published in Al Ittihad. It is the largest circulation newspaper in 
Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates on the Persian Gulf, but an obscure 
periodical in the Arab world. Initial accounts of the interview did not say 
when or where it took place, but there have been no reports that Fadlallah has 
left his home in southern Beirut since the hostage crisis began three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Curtain Drawn 
</P>
<P>
Public statements by officials diminished sharply after the dramatic first week 
of the crisis, which was triggered by the Israeli abduction of Obeid and the 
execution-style killing, reportedly in retaliation, of American hostage William 
R. Higgins, a Marine lieutenant colonel, by Shiite radicals identified with 
Fadlallah's movement. 
</P>
<P>
When the subsequent death threat against Cicippio was suspended, the curtains 
of diplomacy and secrecy were drawn across presumed contacts among the parties 
involved. In Washington and the Middle East, informed observers began using the 
same phrase, "The bazaar is open," meaning the fate and possible freedom of the 
14 remaining Western hostages, including eight Americans, had moved into the 
dark arena of quiet bargaining. "This is a war of nerves," Eitan Haber, a 
spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Pakistan's foreign minister, identified two weeks ago by the 
influential Tehran Times as a likely mediator in the crisis, visited the 
Iranian capital and then went on to Damascus, Syria. Sahabzada Yaqub Khan met 
in the Syrian capital with President Hafez Assad and in Tehran with Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, Iran's new president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip to Washington 
</P>
<P>
In neither capital did the Pakistani envoy speak to the press about his 
mission, which reports from Damascus say will now take him to Washington. 
According to press reports from Iran, however, Rafsanjani reportedly told Yaqub 
Khan: "I have said many times that if the United States expects us to help in 
the Lebanese (hostage) issue, it should show in practice that it has dropped 
its hostile stand against us. (Then) we will be inclined to solve the issue." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Tehran press reports, Rafsanjani specifically mentioned Iran's 
demand that the United States release several billion dollars in impounded 
Iranian assets and pressure the Israelis to free Obeid. The Tehran Times said 
Washington should take "practical steps." 
</P>
<P>
Fadlallah was quoted as saying in the Al Ittihad interview that Iran could be 
instrumental in the bargaining for the release of the hostages, although he 
remarked that "such negotiations have not yet started . . . (and) they could 
last more than six months (when they do)." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times in Damascus last week, Syrian analysts and foreign 
diplomats foresaw a lengthy process. "This is a delicate matter. One cannot use 
force," a Syrian official remarked. He said his government, under pressure from 
Washington to help resolve the crisis, is treating it as a "humanitarian 
matter, but one that should be solved sooner rather than later." 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomatic observer said the hostage issue "is being intensely 
discussed" within the Damascus government. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Robin Wright, in Washington, contributed to this story.

SEASON'S FIRST SNOW IN TETON MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first snow of the season dusted the Teton Mountains of Wyoming and heavy 
rainfall drenched much of the nation. There was flooding in Oklahoma and 
Kansas. Some rural roads remained impassable in portions of Maryland, where an 
official reported holes up to 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep following weekend 
flooding. Showers and thunderstorms soaked the Florida peninsula, across New 
York state and portions of New England. But it was summer as usual with 
temperatures in the 90s in the middle and southern Atlantic coast states, the 
Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley, the southern plains, the interior valleys 
of California, the desert Southwest and near the big bend of the Rio Grande in 
Texas.

A sacred pole topped with a human scalp and said to have the power of life and 
unity was presented to the Omaha Tribe in Macy, Neb., after being held 101 
years in a Boston museum. The pole, believed to be more than 300 years old, is 
a symbol of unity for the American Indian tribe. Its last keeper, Yellow Smoke, 
entrusted it to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University because he doubted 
younger generations of Omahas would cherish it. Tribal officials recently 
negotiated its return. "It will take up where it left off in 1888," tribal 
chairman Doran Morris said last month. "It is a central part of our lives. It 
will influence our children and grandchildren." The pole, more than 5 feet long 
and 4 inches thick, is made of pine believed to have been cut in northern 
Nebraska in the 1600s or 1700s. At its top is a human scalp. Animal skin 
webbing wrapped around the middle of the pole contains feathers and down from 
cranes. A stake made from ash is at the bottom.

Several hundred East Germans arrived at crowded West German refugee camps, a 
day after they fled across the Austro-Hungarian border. West German government 
officials said that about 500 East Germans had come by chartered trains and 
buses from Vienna to the main transit camp in Giessen north of Frankfurt and to 
another camp near Nuremberg. They were among 661 East Germans who the officials 
said had shown up at the West German Embassy in Vienna after fleeing from 
Hungary to Austria through an open gate at a picnic site.

It may cost as much as $5 billion a year to treat AIDS patients with AZT, the 
drug that slows progression of the fatal disease, federal health officials 
estimated. The Department of Health and Human Services has added 400,000 to the 
number of people eligible to receive the medication by declaring it effective 
for those who carry the AIDS virus but have not yet exhibited symptoms. AZT now 
costs about $8,000 annually for each patient, according to the National 
Institutes of Health, and the drug already was available to an estimated 
200,000 people with AIDS. "You're talking about $5 billion," said John Klemm, 
an analyst for the federal Health Care Financing Agency. "It's a huge burden."

Speeding, you spot the police cruiser just in time. You brake, then smile as 
you glide by the unsuspecting officer at the legal speed limit. But who is 
fooling whom? Oceanside's finest has just put one over on you. 
</P>
<P>
The latest addition to the city's police force is Sandra Safety, a blond, 
life-size mannequin decked out in a patrolman's tunic that sits all day inside 
a police car parked on Oceanside streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police have used the mannequin since June 1 to trick speeders into obeying the 
law, according to Sgt. Gene Fernandes. 
</P>
<P>
The results, Fernandes said, are dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched for a while from an unmarked car, and the brake lights just all 
come on as (motorists) go creeping by at 20 m.p.h," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, Fernandes consults his computer on the most dangerous, 
accident-prone spots in town. Then two officers come in to pick up Sandra and 
deposit her at that location. The rate of accidents there drops through the 
floor, Fernandes said.

NEW WESTERN INS CHIEF LIKES LOW PROFILE; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIDIAN ALSO IS GOP LOYALIST, BUT SIMILARITY WITH EZELL ENDS THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Davidian may be as much of a Republican Party loyalist as his predecessor, 
but that's where the similarity ends between him and the man he replaced as the 
top immigration official in the West, the colorful Harold Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
He's not going to sing in public as Ezell did. 
</P>
<P>
He's not going to dance with Imelda Marcos or anyone else who might be 
controversial or under public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he had a sombrero, Davidian -- mindful that Ezell occasionally 
donned one -- nervously chuckled and eyed the questioner's tape recorder. "Shut 
that thing off," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Davidian, 38, quickly showed in his first week on the job as the new 
Western regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
that he will be a different sort of public servant than the 52-year-old Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"You could immediately tell a difference," said one INS staffer, who was 
surprised to find Davidian at his desk for an unannounced introduction shortly 
after the new commissioner reported to work. "Ezell was a little loosy goosy -- 
I guess that's how he got into trouble. Davidian was friendly and all that, but 
I got the sense he isn't going to say weird things. He has his guard up." 
</P>
<P>
Staffers still shake their heads at one Ezell classic, which caused Latino 
activists to call for his dismissal. Describing a streamlined screening process 
for aliens at the border, Ezell said in 1986: "If you catch 'em, you ought to 
clean 'em and fry 'em yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In an informal chat at the INS regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel, Davidian 
said he will have a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be a lower profile," said the former chairman of the California 
Agriculture Labor Relations Board. "I'll probably do most of my management here 
in this building and in the other (INS) offices." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian declined to be drawn into a discussion on immigration policy issues or 
his personal views on such volatile subjects as amnesty or the controversial 
INS roundups of illegal immigrants on the streets where they congregate to ask 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
He said he preferred to wait until attorney Gene McNary, the elected chief 
executive officer of St. Louis County, Mo., is confirmed as the new INS 
commissioner. McNary was nominated earlier this month to succeed Alan Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
So, the conversation centered on his background, his 2 1/2 years as chairman of 
the ALRB and, to an extent, his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
On the last count, he was quick to praise Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner Ezell did a pretty darn good job here," Davidian said, noting 
that Ezell has been personally credited with persuading many illegals to sign 
up for amnesty under the initial phase of the 1986 immigration reform law. 
About 60% of the 3 million who applied came from the INS' Western region of 
California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
"He was faced with the most sweeping change in immigration law in the history 
of this country," Davidian continued. "It required a whole policy . . . the 
biggest task being going out there and getting people to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"In the process, he became high profile." 
</P>
<P>
But Davidian would not reply directly when asked if he might scrap his low-key 
style to ensure that all of the 1.8 million aliens who signed up in the West 
complete the amnesty program's Phase II requirements of knowledge of English 
and U.S. history. "That's one of the highest priorities of this agency," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On other topics, Davidian: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he planned no wholesale changes within the agency's ranks, but he 
emphatically reminded INS employees that it is not solely an enforcer of the 
nation's immigration laws. "We are also a service agency," he said. "People 
can't go around waiting years for the greatest prize that this country can 
bestow on someone, citizenship, only to be treated rudely by someone at a front 
counter. That just isn't acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
* Asked INS critics, who charge that the agency is anti-Latino, not to be too 
harsh. "Give us a chance," he said. "Give us a little time. I don't think it's 
as negative as it used to be. If there's a negative image, it's getting better. 
You can't be an enforcement agency and please everybody. You can't do that. All 
you can do is to carry out the law within the policies of the Bush 
Administration as fairly and appropriately as we can. And every now and then, 
somebody's going to be upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rejected the suggestion from critics of his tenure as ALRB chairman that he had 
no appreciation for farm workers. "That is hot and dusty work," he said, 
recalling a summer of picking pears in Apple Valley as a youth. "And when I was 
able to do something else, I did something else. I'm not going to try and tell 
you that I have a lot of experience in the fields, but my short experience 
tells me that's a damn hard way to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, a lawyer by training who spent four years as a flight navigator in 
the Air Force, grew particularly testy when he was reminded of charges by 
ranking officials of the United Farm Workers of America that he was pro-grower 
since he was appointed to the ALRB in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned if Dolores Huerta (UFW co-founder and first vice president) 
thinks that I'm anti-Latino because she is wrong," he said. "I read someplace 
where someone said that 97% of my decisions was pro-grower. That's absolute 
foolishness. If you read them, the majority of my decisions were rendered for 
the farm workers. A lot of growers were mad after a case went against them and 
they called the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"And some of the angriest recommended me in letters to the White House for this 
job. They told me, 'We've come to view you as a fair man.' " 
</P>
<P>
A UFW spokesman said that the ALRB under Davidian investigated fewer complaints 
filed by the union than previously. "He can say all he wants, but the fact is 
farm workers are not better off today because of Mr. Davidian and his pals in 
the Deukmejian Administration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised by Some 
</P>
<P>
In his first week, Davidian was praised by some INS executives as a quick study 
who knows more about immigration issues than he lets on. "He's asked some very 
probing questions," one agency executive said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Fresno who won his political stripes on the campaigns of prominent 
GOP stars, including former President Ronald Reagan, President Bush and 
California Gov. George Deukmejian, Davidian cuts a different physical presence 
than Ezell. While the stout, older Ezell used his hands and arms to punctuate a 
conversation, the erect Davidian seemed less gregarious, according to INS 
employees who met him last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't strike me as the type you'd invite out for a beer," one staffer 
said. Then he amended his thoughts: "Well, maybe we should."

ANTI-FRAUD LAW'S MERITS DEBATED; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT. DECISION MAY HAVE BIG EFFECT ON WHISTLE BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For several months, Justice Department officials have engaged in intense 
internal debate over the merits of a 1986 law designed to encourage citizens to 
become "whistle blowers" and expose fraud against the government. 
</P>
<P>
Some Justice Department lawyers want to challenge the constitutionality of the 
law, while others contend that this would be a foolhardy decision, according to 
government sources and attorneys representing both whistle blowers and defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's position could have a significant impact not only on a 
major constitutional issue but also on efforts to ferret out fraud by defense 
contractors, Medicare providers and other companies that do business with the 
government. Millions, perhaps billions, of dollars could ride on the outcome. 
Since the law was passed, $26 million has been recovered from government 
contractors in 11 cases. More than 150 lawsuits, many in California, are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
The law in question is called the False Claims Act, originally enacted in 1863. 
As amended in 1986, it permits a private citizen to file a civil suit in the 
name of the government alleging fraud by a contractor and to share in any 
financial recovery by the government. The act also provides that any whistle 
blowers who lose their jobs or experience any career discrimination as a 
consequence of filing the suit can sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that the Justice Department might challenge the law's validity 
has prompted a bipartisan coalition of U.S. senators, led by conservative Iowa 
Republican Charles E. Grassley, to press Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to take a 
clear stand supporting the law's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
Grassley also has lobbied Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. The senator 
maintains that the law has had a significant deterrent effect on fraud and that 
its impact will grow as knowledge of the statute and how it can be used 
spreads. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he is particularly disturbed by reports that the Justice 
Department, which had supported enactment of the whistle-blower amendments in 
1986, might now come out against the law. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's position could become known as early as this week. 
U.S. District Judge David Kenyon has given the department until Wednesday to 
inform him if it plans to take a stand on constitutionality in a Los Angeles 
suit by former employees of Northrop who have accused the company of knowingly 
using defective parts on guidance systems for the Air Force's MX missile. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Solicitor General Tom Merrill and Gina Talamona, a Justice Department 
spokeswoman, said the department has "no comment" on its constitutionality 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
Defense contractors contend that the law violates the separation of powers and 
appointments clauses of the Constitution and that private citizens do not have 
standing to sue because they have not been individually injured by the alleged 
wrongdoing. They also assert that the law encourages unfounded suits by 
disgruntled, money-seeking employees who file cases hoping that companies will 
settle simply to avoid costly litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whistle-blower lawyers maintain that the law is clearly constitutional. They 
note that the Justice Department has the ability to take over any of these 
cases or to veto settlements in those it does not take over. The plaintiffs' 
lawyers also contend that courts have "consistently recognized the 
congressional prerogative" to grant standing to a person to sue on behalf of 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Starr has held private meetings with lawyers on both sides of 
the issue. Among those attacking the law in the meetings was former Solicitor 
General Rex Lee, now president of Brigham Young University, who filed a brief 
last week in Los Angeles challenging the law on behalf of two defense industry 
lobbying organizations and Brad Brian and Carolyn Kuehl of Los Angeles' Muger, 
Tolles and Olson, a firm defending Northrop and Litton in whistle-blower cases. 
</P>
<P>
Among those supporting it were Robert Montgomery, former chief counsel at the 
Energy Department who is the attorney for Business Executives for National 
Security and who represents whistle blowers in cases against Raytheon and 
Singer Co., and Herbert Hafif, a Claremont lawyer with several cases against 
Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
This year, three federal judges in California -- William D. Keller and Mariana 
R. Pfaelzer in Los Angeles and Robert Aguilar in San Jose -- have upheld the 
constitutionality of the law. The Justice Department did not take a stand in 
any of those cases or an earlier one in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But sources inside and outside the government said several lawyers in the 
department's civil fraud section, including its chief, Michael F. Hertz, 
believe that the whistle-blower law tramples on government prerogatives to make 
decisions about who will be prosecuted for fraud. Hertz could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Decision Required 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that some Justice Department officials resent the fact that after 
a private citizen files suit, the department is required to make a decision 
within 60 days on whether it will join the action. "It's like having someone 
looking over their shoulder," said a source in the Washington legal community 
who has closely followed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that Hertz also is troubled that the law, by requiring a 
prompt decision, sometimes forces the civil fraud division to alter its 
investigative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
If the Justice Department took a position that the law was unconstitutional, 
this would give weight to the defense industry's challenges and could have a 
chilling effect on the campaign to ferret out fraud, said John R. Phillips, a 
Los Angeles lawyer who has several fraud suits pending against defense 
contractors and who helped draft the 1986 amendments. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of the law was to unearth information that otherwise 
wouldn't have come to the surface," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
1986 law has "brought people out of the woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), ranking minority member on the committee, are 
among the 10 committee members who joined Grassley in signing a letter to 
Thornburgh earlier this month reaffirming the support they gave to the 1986 
whistle-blower law "and our belief in its constitutional validity." 
</P>
<P>
The letter states that one of the major goals in amending the statute in 1986 
"was to encourage assistance from private citizens in the fight against fraud 
by enhancing the qui tam provision of the act." Qui tam is an ancient Latin 
phrase that means "he who sues for the king as well as himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Law Works 
</P>
<P>
The law works as follows: If a private citizen thinks he has a valid claim 
under the law, he files a suit in the appropriate federal district court under 
seal and informs the Justice Department that the suit has been filed. The 
Justice Department has 60 days to investigate the merits of the claim and 
decide whether to join the suit, though sometimes extensions are granted. 
Keeping the case under seal enables the department to investigate without 
informing the company. 
</P>
<P>
When the department has made its decision, it must announce whether it is 
joining the case, and if not, why not. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Justice Department decides to take over a case, the private 
plaintiff retains a role in the litigation. The plaintiff receives copies of 
all papers filed by the department and has a right to file objections to any 
settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The citizen plaintiff can gain a substantial share of any recovery, from 10% to 
30% depending on the extent of the private plaintiff's role in prosecuting the 
case and on whether the Justice Department joined the case. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, 167 suits nationwide have been filed under the law, Justice 
Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said, and a healthy share of them are in 
California because the state garners about $35 billion a year in defense 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the Justice Department joined 27 of the suits and declined to enter 
66 others. The remaining 74 cases are still under seal pending further Justice 
Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 11 of the suits have been settled, resulting in a recovery of $26 
million to the federal Treasury, less several million dollars that went to the 
private plaintiffs, Justice Department officials said. The law was designed 
primarily to help curb defense procurement fraud, but two of the settled cases 
involved Medicare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
None of the cases have gone to trial yet. 
</P>
<P>
In several suits, including some currently pending in federal district court in 
Los Angeles, private citizen plaintiffs could recover more than a million 
dollars if the cases are successfully prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Justice Department announced that it would take over the largest 
such suit to date -- a case filed in Baltimore by Christopher Urda, a former 
Singer Co. pricing administrator who asserted that the company overcharged the 
Pentagon $77 million between 1980 and 1985 by maintaining two sets of books on 
contracts for flight simulators. 
</P>
<P>
The statute entitles the government to triple damages -- in this case up to 
$231 million. In a False Claims case taken over by the government, the private 
plaintiff can get up to 25% of the recovery, meaning Urda could take home 
nearly $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Firm Challenges 
</P>
<P>
But several constitutional challenges to the law have been launched by large 
defense contractors, including General Electric, Litton, Lockheed, McDonnell 
Douglas and Northrop, as well as two industry lobbying groups, the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. of America and the National Security Industrial Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, all federal district court judges who have ruled on the issue have 
upheld the statute. However, other constitutional challenges are pending, 
including ones raised by Litton and Northrop in Los Angeles. Legal observers 
said it is likely that at least one of the defense contractors will take a case 
all the way to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Sen. Grassley said he was stunned at the possibility that the 
Justice Department might come out against the law's constitutionality. He 
stressed that department officials had supported the whistle-blower amendments, 
citing a 1986 letter from then-Assistant Atty. Gen. John R. Bolton to Grassley 
that said the Justice Department "strongly supports" the Senate's amendments to 
the False Claims Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A More Effective Tool' 
</P>
<P>
Grassley's office also provided a November, 1986, letter from President Reagan, 
who said after signing the law, "The amendments . . . will make this 
123-year-old statute a more effective tool for the prosecution and recovery of 
losses suffered through fraud against the United States government." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who spearheaded efforts to get the 
amendments passed in the House of Representatives, said, "Never once did 
Justice raise the specter of constitutionality while this bill was moving 
through the legislative process." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing" in the 1986 amendments "that fundamentally changes" what 
President Abraham Lincoln was doing when he pushed for enactment of the False 
Claims Act in 1863 in an attempt to bring to justice contractors who were 
selling the government gunpowder diluted with sawdust during the Civil War, the 
congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, James B. Helmer Jr., a Cincinnati attorney who has successfully 
prosecuted several qui tam cases against defense contractors, including four 
settled en masse last March that compelled General Electric to pay $3.5 million 
to the government, said he would not be surprised if the Justice Department 
came out against the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resistance at Justice 
</P>
<P>
During negotiations on amending the False Claims Act four years ago, 
representatives of the Justice Department "resisted making it easier for 
private citizens to sue," Helmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gewirtz, a Yale Law School professor, has filed friend-of-the-court briefs 
on the constitutionality issue on behalf of the Aerospace Industries Assn. and 
the National Security Industrial Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the central arguments we're making is that if there is a wrong to the 
government, a wrong to all of us that is being complained about, a suit should 
be under the control of public officials, not self-appointed private citizens 
with their own self-serving objectives," Gewirtz said. "If private people can 
claim to speak for all of us, there's a terrible danger that private interest 
will govern litigation decisions." But Los Angeles federal district Judge 
Pfaelzer spurned this argument in upholding the constitutionality of the law in 
a decision issued last Monday in a whistle-blower suit alleging that Northrop 
overcharged the government by at least $2 billion on the B-2 Stealth bomber 
project. "In authorizing private prosecutorial action on the government's 
behalf in the False Claims Act . . . Congress is making a policy decision based 
on its perception of how best to serve the public interest," Pfaelzer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Oral arguments on the next constitutional challenge to the law are scheduled 
before Los Angeles federal district Judge David V. Kenyon on Sept. 12. That 
suit alleged that Northrop, based in Hawthorne, defrauded the Air Force by 
knowingly using defective parts on the electronic guidance system for the MX 
missile. Northrop has vigorously denied those charges, as well as those leveled 
in the Stealth bomber case.

FBI REPORTEDLY WILL INVESTIGATE SHOOTING OF VIET WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The FBI will investigate the attempted assassination of Vietnamese author Doan 
Van Toai, who reportedly had received death threats at his home several weeks 
after writing a controversial magazine article that called for the United 
States to establish diplomatic ties with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Toai, who was shot three times as he was walking home Saturday, had informed 
the FBI about threats including a mailed warning accompanied by a bullet, 
sources within the Fresno Vietnamese community said. 
</P>
<P>
A Fresno County Sheriff's Department spokesman declined Sunday to comment on 
reports of recent death threats but said the FBI decided to intervene in the 
case at the request of the family. 
</P>
<P>
Toai, who remained in serious condition Sunday at Valley Medical Center in 
Fresno, has long been a controversial figure because of his actions during the 
Vietnam War and his writing since. 
</P>
<P>
Through his books "The Vietnamese Gulag" and "Portrait of the Enemy," 
co-written with David Chanoff, and his magazine, Toai in recent years has 
advocated restoring ties with Vietnam to deliver humanitarian aid to the 
people. In a 1986 interview with The Times, he said that an article he wrote 
exposing alleged fraud by an anti-Communist group provoked death threats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Threatened 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times saying these people who want to 
fight the Communist government are collecting money for that cause but are 
actually using the money for themselves," Toai said then. "The group that I 
wrote about in 1982 was overwhelmingly supported by the refugee community in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The group threatened to kill my whole family after the story ran," Toai said. 
</P>
<P>
An associate blamed the attempt on Toai's life on a mistranslation of something 
Toai had written recently in his newsletter about reeducation camps and 
resettlement. "Due to that mistranslation we received a lot of tension, the 
community (became) upset," said the associate, Vinh Ngo. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno police said Toai was shot about half a mile from his home in an 
upper-middle-class section of northern Fresno. He had dropped his car off 
shortly before 9 a.m. at a service station, shopped and was walking home when 
he was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
He was hit three times -- once in the head and twice in the body -- at close 
range by gunfire from an automatic pistol, authorities said. Witnesses told 
police the shots came from a dirty brown Pontiac station wagon carrying two 
Asian men. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he was talking to them" when he was shot, Fresno Police Lt. Robert 
Hagler said. Toai staggered to the front door of a nearby house and asked for 
help before collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is the latest of several attacks in California in recent years 
against Vietnamese refugees who advocate that the United States establish 
diplomatic relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was shot in Orange 
County's Little Saigon after he was quoted as saying he supported normalizing 
relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was convicted. And on 
April 30, 1988, novelist Long Vu suffered partial paralysis after a severe 
beating in the same Westminster refugee community. Vu's columns were critical 
of both the South Vietnamese and present Communist governments in Vietnam. Last 
January, an arson fire destroyed a Garden Grove travel agency specializing in 
tours to Vietnam. No suspects have been arrested in the last two incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Toai's political views have long put him at odds with many in Southern 
California's Vietnamese refugee community. Vietnamese-language newspapers have 
written editorials against him, and outspoken leaders warned him that his views 
are unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
Nhat Tien, a Santa Ana writer and poet, said Toai recently published a 
Washington magazine, Institute for Democracy in Vietnam, which served as a 
vehicle for expressing his political views on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine's summer, 1989, issue, Toai argued that the United States 
should establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, said Tien, who had a copy 
of Toai's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Toai "believes that if there is a relationship with the United States, the 
condition of the poor Vietnamese people would change for the better. He 
believed that if economic conditions improved, the political climate would 
change, much like China," Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Fresno Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Cobbs said there have been no recent 
political firestorms "that I know of" in Fresno's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
In both Fresno, one of the largest Vietnamese resettlement communities in the 
country, and in Orange County's Little Saigon, Toai was far from popular among 
refugees, several community leaders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Fresno, a member of the Vietnamese Assn. of Central Valley said many people 
in the refugee community were suspicious of Toai because he made statements 
that led people to believe he supported the Communists. "He said, 'The 
Communists do some good things for the people of Vietnam.' . . . We escaped to 
come here; no way we can support the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
A prominent member of Fresno's Vietnamese community who asked not to be 
identified added: "The Vietnamese community is really talking about this, 
they're not surprised he was shot." 
</P>
<P>
Chuyen V. Nguyen, a former South Vietnamese Air Force pilot who lives in Orange 
County, recalled that Toai was a member of South Vietnam's educated class who 
led anti-war protests in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a lot of damage to the democracy of Vietnam back home," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after Toai escaped from some so-called prison in 1977 or 1978, he 
traveled to China with a North Vietnamese official who then opposed the regime 
in North Vietnam. We in the Vietnamese refugee community believe he has close 
ties to Vietnam," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese people here in the U.S. view him as another member of the 
Communist Party."

SOVIETS SHOW OFF TOP-SECRET BLACKJACK

<P>
The deadliest weapon in the arsenal of the Soviet air force -- the needle-nosed 
strategic bomber that NATO calls the Blackjack -- was revealed to the Soviet 
people and the rest of the world on Sunday for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The plane made a dazzling public debut at a three-hour air show, the country's 
first in more than 20 years. Its appearance apparently was aimed to show Soviet 
and foreign doubters that the Soviet air force still has the right stuff 
following a chain of recent aviation mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
Although Western air attaches who attended the show said they saw little that 
was new, the "Aviation-Sports Holiday" was clearly in line with the policy of 
glasnost, or openness, pursued by the Kremlin under President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. The policy has brought an easing of the once-obsessive secrecy about 
military affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Assembled on the grass at Tushino airfield in northwest Moscow, more than 
150,000 people saw the supersonic Blackjack bomber streak overhead, along with 
other aeronautics novelties such as the Ilyushin 96-300 jetliner and the 
cigar-shaped Tupolev 204, called the Soviet version of the Boeing 757 by 
Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATO Code Name 
</P>
<P>
Blackjack is the code name given the bomber by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. The Soviets call it the Tupolev TU-160. 
</P>
<P>
The plane the Pentagon says is the world's largest and heaviest bomber flashed 
out of the north over Tushino at a height of only 800 to 1,000 feet, its four 
thundering jet engines leaving a yellow smudge of exhaust in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Flying at about 380 miles per hour, the plane, whose nose resembles that of the 
Concorde supersonic airliner, shot past the airfield in seconds, then peeled 
off toward the south and the high-rise towers of a Moscow residential district. 
Despite its military function, the plane was painted a dazzling white. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Pentagon's 1988 study "Soviet Military Power," the bomber has 
a maximum speed of Mach 2 -- twice the speed of sound, or more than 1,300 
m.p.h. -- and an unrefueled combat range of about 4,500 miles. It reportedly 
can carry payloads of bombs or cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Then-U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci was invited to inspect a 
Blackjack bomber at Kubinka air base near Moscow in August, 1988, and saw it 
fly, but Sunday's flight was the first before the general public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Blackjacks to Be Built 
</P>
<P>
According to Jane's "All the World's Aircraft 1988-89," the Soviets are 
expected to build at least 100 Blackjacks at a new complex in Kazan. Eleven had 
been completed by 1988, Jane's said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tushino air show, the Soviets' first since 1967, was officially held to 
celebrate Aviation Day, marked every Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Western air attaches suggested that one purpose of the show may have been to 
give the Soviet people a more favorable image of their air force to counter 
recent mishaps and problems. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a pilotless MIG-23 flew halfway across Europe and crashed in Belgium, 
killing an 18-year-old man, after its Soviet pilot ejected over Poland. 
</P>

The previous month, a MIG-29 fighter crashed at the prestigious Paris Air Show. 
A joint Soviet-French commission established that a bird had been sucked into 
the engine, causing the crash. Earlier this year, a Soviet pilot defected to 
Turkey in a MIG-29.

IN A TEST OF WILLS, PANAMA'S NORIEGA SHOWS NO SIGNS OF BENDING TO U.S.

More than a week of spectacular American military maneuvers, fruitless 
political negotiations and a shift of U.S. policy has failed again to break the 
will of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panama's military ruler. He remains in full 
control with no indication that he will give up power. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no signs of any progress," a diplomatic source said in a telephone 
interview over the weekend. "There is no reason for optimism" in the effort to 
drive Noriega from power. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has sought the removal of the general it once favored since early 
1988, when Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on 
drug-trafficking charges. The United States tried last week to raise the 
pressure by staging aggressive and large-scale military maneuvers, including 
exercises in the streets of Panama City, under the guise of asserting rights 
under the Panama Canal treaties that assign the defense of the waterway to 
American troops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designed to Weaken Morale 
</P>
<P>
However, military sources acknowledged that the U.S. maneuvers also were 
designed to weaken the morale of the Panama Defense Forces and undermine 
Noriega's arguments that the Americans have neither the will nor the ability to 
threaten his power. 
</P>
<P>
Until two weeks ago, American maneuvers were generally limited to running 
convoys between various U.S. bases along the canal. But starting Aug. 9, the 
U.S. Southern Command, which is based just outside Panama City, changed its 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
That day, heavily armed American units using armored troop carriers and 
helicopters blockaded Ft. Amador, a large installation shared by the Panama 
Defense Forces and U.S. troops and containing key Panamanian military 
facilities, including an office and house used by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a series of small but potentially deadly confrontations between 
U.S. and Panamanian forces last week, American columns began moving through the 
streets of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, U.S. soldiers occupied a large area of the downtown section where 
Panama's courts are located. Then, last Thursday, a special U.S. Marine Corps 
strike force using helicopters descended on the area surrounding the American 
Embassy and closed it off to Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was Something to See' 
</P>
<P>
"It was spectacular," said a witness in a telephone conversation. "The 
helicopters suddenly appeared and the Marines came down on ropes. It was 
something to see." 
</P>
<P>
Panama has protested that the exercises are invasions of its sovereignty and 
are tantamount to a military invasion. One U.S. official countered that 
SouthCom, as the Southern Command is commonly called, is "bringing to bear 
sufficient force to assert U.S. treaty rights as called for by President Bush." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Panamanians have backed off, but "the confrontations have led to 
potentially explosive situations," said a diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
How long an incident of shooting can be avoided is questionable, said a 
European diplomat. "The PDF is clearly stung and is increasingly frustrated, 
and it is stepping up its harassment of individual Americans in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Against this military posturing has been a sputtering and so far meaningless 
round of talks between Noriega's agents and leaders of the country's political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Under auspices of the Organization of American States, the two sides have been 
trying to negotiate an end to the political crisis that arose after Noriega 
refused to accept what international observers said was the overwhelming defeat 
of the general's handpicked candidate for president in elections May 7. The 
observers said that Noriega first tried to rig the vote count. When that 
failed, his puppet civilian administration nullified the election, and Noriega 
has since rejected all suggestions that the opposition, internationally viewed 
as the clear winner, be installed in office. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, insisting it should be allowed to take power on the Sept. 1 
date fixed by the constitution, has proposed a plebiscite on whether Noriega 
should give up power. The general has said no. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, face-to-face talks broke down Friday, although the OAS says that 
indirect talks continue, with Secretary General Joao Baena Soares shuttling 
between the contending sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Sees No Hope 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Duque, Noriega's presidential candidate, told reporters Saturday that 
"we are determined as ever to find a political solution" through the indirect 
talks. But opposition sources said in a telephone interview that they expect 
nothing to come of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last stage," said Ricardo Arias Calderon of the opposition 
Christian Democratic Party, "and I don't see how anything can come of this when 
the government wouldn't move in direct talks." 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat close to the talks echoed that sentiment. "When they were sitting in 
the same room, they just repeated the same old stands and were talking past 
each other. Now they are sitting in separate rooms and talking past each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Other opposition sources, who asked not to be named to avoid offending the 
United States, said the situation hasn't been helped by what they see as 
waffling by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
After steadfastly insisting that not only must Noriega give up power but that 
he must also leave Panama, the Administration last week changed its position. 
State Department spokesmen said that Washington now insists only that Noriega 
relinquish power, although they could not explain how that might be 
accomplished if he is allowed to remain in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of thing only gives Noriega confidence," said an opposition source. 
"He has always believed that he can outlast the Americans, and when Washington 
backs down, even a little bit, he gains confidence." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Noriega is increasing his pressure on the opposition and is 
increasingly isolating the country from outside influences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized TV Network 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, he seized and shut down a privately owned television 
network that, in a cautious way, had broadcast some opposition views. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Noriega has all but closed his country to outside journalists. 
With the limited exceptions of brief visits by American and British news 
agencies that distribute their services to government-controlled newspapers, no 
correspondent for major American and European newspaper and broadcast media has 
been allowed into Panama since the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega thinks if he keeps you (foreign reporters) out, the world will forget 
what's going on here and the international pressure against him will go away," 
a European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, even American diplomats agree. "I personally don't see any more reason 
for Noriega to leave now than before," said one such official. "He outlasted us 
before, and he may well do it again."

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SALE TO CHINA PUSHED; 
</P>
<P>
REP. LAGOMARSINO PRESSES STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA FIRM 
</P>

<P>
California Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) has been urging the State 
Department to let a small California company sell custom-made television 
surveillance systems to China, where they could be used to keep watch on 
political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials say, and Lagomarsino confirms, that the congressman 
recently called Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger seeking a 
special waiver that would exempt the company, Quintron Systems Inc., from the 
Bush Administration's recent ban on the sale of military-related equipment to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"It strikes me as absurd to be selling something like this to China at this 
point," commented one U.S. official familiar with Lagomarsino's request. "I 
can't imagine anything more offensive to a large number of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Lagomarsino, a conservative Republican who is a 
senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Times that he 
sought to help the company because of its financial difficulties and that he 
did not realize the goods involved were surveillance systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Know What It Was' 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was some kind of electronic equipment, but I didn't know what it 
was," Lagomarsino said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just knew that it was an order for several million dollars (of goods) that 
they (Quintron) would not be able to sell elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino told The Times that he now plans to review the Quintron request to 
see if it involves goods that should not be sent to China. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my impression that this was low-technology equipment," he said. "It 
wasn't clear to me. I'll have to take another look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger did not respond to requests for comment on Lagomarsino's efforts. 
One U.S. official explained that Eagleburger and other State Department 
officials want to avoid alienating Lagomarsino, who is the ranking Republican 
on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee for Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
However, he and other U.S. officials said that they do not believe the 
exemption will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks after China's People's Liberation Army launched its bloody assault 
on Tian An Men Square in Beijing in June, the Chinese regime began to air 
selective TV footage of the activities of student protesters taken by 
surveillance cameras on Beijing streets and inside buildings. The regime has 
long had surveillance cameras inside foreign diplomatic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, the items Quintron wants to sell to China are 
being identified as "television monitors with sensitive optics components such 
as image intensifiers and converters." Because of the potential military use of 
such equipment, its sale to China or any other Communist country requires the 
approval of the State Department's Office of Munitions Control. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Bryan E. Thompson, chairman and president of Quintron 
Systems, described the equipment at issue as a "surveillance television 
system." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what it's built for is surveillance of factories and that sort of 
thing," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made to Chinese Requirements 
</P>
<P>
He also said that his company has custom-designed the equipment for Chinese 
requirements but did not say what those requirements are. Quintron previously 
has done business overseas with South Korea and Saudi Arabia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese enterprise to which Quintron is selling the surveillance systems is 
Poly Technologies Inc. U.S. officials have identified Poly Technologies as one 
of the two major Chinese trading companies that buy and sell arms for the 
Chinese armed forces. The firms are controlled by Chinese military leaders, and 
He Ping, president of Poly Technologies, is the son-in-law of China's paramount 
leader, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
Material submitted to the State Department lists the final user of the TV 
surveillance systems as an organization called the Beijing Institute of 
Information, about which little is known. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was told that Quintron's equipment will be used not by the 
Chinese government but by a university or research group. Chinese universities 
and research institutes are controlled by the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things (the surveillance systems) can be used for only one purpose," 
said one State Department official, who said that he does not believe the 
request for a waiver by Lagomarsino and Quintron will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he began trying to help Quintron obtain a waiver from the Bush 
Administration's restrictions on sales to China about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked us to help them," he said. " . . . All I know is they represented 
to me that if they couldn't make the sale, they might go under." 
</P>
<P>
Quintron Systems is a small, privately held company in Santa Maria, in 
Lagomarsino's congressional district. According to Thompson, the company has 
220 employees and sales of about $15 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that it would be "a disaster" if his company is not permitted to 
ship the surveillance cameras to China. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Quintron has signed a $2.125-million contract to sell the 
surveillance systems to China. The deal, the first the company has concluded 
with Beijing, was signed long before the bloody Chinese army crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators last June 3-4. In response to that assault, 
President Bush ordered a suspension of all U.S. military sales to China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Timing Was Bad' 
</P>
<P>
"Our timing was bad," Thompson said mournfully. "These (Bush Administration) 
sanctions hit two weeks before the commodities were to be shipped. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that these (surveillance) systems were custom-made to Chinese 
requirements. They've been sitting on the dock since June 25, and we can't ship 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't collect a penny until (the TV systems) get on board the ship," 
Thompson added. "We've borrowed money from the bank to handle the cash flow 
until we can ship." 
</P>
<P>
Both Lagomarsino and Thompson compared Quintron's request to one made earlier 
by Boeing Co. Last month, the State Department granted a waiver of the Bush 
Administration's sanctions to permit Boeing to sell four commercial jetliners 
to China. The navigation systems for those jets have potential military uses 
and therefore are on the State Department's munitions control list.

RIANE EISLER LAUNCHED A MOVEMENT BY SEEING A SOCIETY OF PARTNERS, NOT 
DOMINATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is an idyllic place where Riane Eisler lives with her husband, David Loye -- 
a graceful old house hidden away in a garden, its rooms nevertheless filled 
with light. Pale Chinese carpets line the floors, ethnic art objects are on the 
walls and shelves, quiet prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered throughout are original and copied figurines that bear witness to the 
worship of the goddess in various prehistoric societies. There are also a few 
latter-day vestiges, like one very modern and colorful Mexican bird goddess 
that Eisler pats fondly on a tour of the house, saying of it in passing, "That 
was David's dowry." 
</P>
<P>
A perfect place for one whose message is that for 20,000 years of human 
society, its end overlapping with the beginning of recorded history about 5,000 
years ago, the world was an idyllic place, with men and women living in 
partnership, in harmony with nature, in more equitable social structures than 
today, and in peace -- shunning violence, not knowing war. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a chance to finish this work in a setting that was like a magical 
garden," she said of moving here from Westwood 12 years ago. "It was a space to 
really remove myself." 
</P>
<P>
In her work, "The Chalice &amp; the Blade: Our History, Our Future," Eisler 
writes of a time when people worshiped a nurturing, life-giving goddess of 
nature, symbolized by the chalice. They celebrated life and developed highly 
civilized agrarian societies, the highest being Minoan Crete. It ended when 
waves of invasions of warlike hunters and herders, worshipers of male deities 
of vengeance, destruction and death, symbolized by the blade, overthrew these 
societies. The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
To Eisler, as she told one audience in Santa Monica recently, this period when 
society shifted from a partnership to dominator model, "has held us in its vise 
for 5,000 years" and it's time to break out. 
</P>
<P>
If we lived in partnership once before, she says, we can do it again. She sees 
not a utopian fantasy, but a real possibility of building a "pragmatopia." 
Those who work for a peaceful and just society need not be called visionaries, 
she says. The evidence is in the past; it is realistic to work for new social 
structures based on partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Are her theories remote, esoteric, irrelevant, off the wall, a pack of lies, 
unsubstantiated in the past, improbable for the future? To some who have read 
her, or heard about her views, they are all these things. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the book, published two years ago by Harper &amp; Row, is in its 14th 
printing -- available in Finnish; coming out soon in Italian, German, French, 
Portuguese, Spanish and Greek, with a Japanese translation under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
For all its data and reading of the past, the book is a call to action. It has 
been taken as such by both men and women to a degree Eisler did not anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, Eisler and Loye founded "The Center for Partnership Studies" as a 
way of responding to a growing constituency. Recently, it was moved into 
donated office space in Malibu, which will serve both as the international 
headquarters and a regional center. One paid staff member is on board, an 
executive director will be hired soon and numerous volunteers are at work on 
everything from fund-raising and networking to developing workshops, position 
papers and events. 
</P>
<P>
She and Loye have developed a workbook, called "The Partnership Way," a study 
and organizing manual for "The Chalice &amp; the Blade." Harper &amp; Row will 
publish it soon, but the center is already selling photocopied versions, so 
great is the demand, Eisler said. 
</P>
<P>
In the crowded little room in her home that initially housed the center, Eisler 
pulled out a file drawer full of letters, and sheafing through them, said, 
"This is how the organization grew. People weren't just writing to say how much 
it meant. They said, 'I want to be a part of it.' So, a group of people got 
together and said, 'What will we do?' . . . The idea is obviously one whose 
time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling her trademark radiant smile, Eisler mentioned the satellite centers 
that have formed: a potluck supper discussion group that meets in Chicago, 
centers in formation in San Francisco, Princeton, Santa Fe and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"There is even," Eisler said in pure delight, "a woman in the Seychelles 
running a partnership salon." 
</P>
<P>
The result of 12 years of research that followed a complete physical and 
emotional collapse, the book, Eisler says, is really the culmination of an 
anguished, lifelong search on her part -- a Jewish woman now in her late 50s 
who fled the Nazis with her parents from her native Vienna, grew up as a 
refugee in Havana and later Los Angeles, and saw her whole belief system 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Her normal demeanor is one of glowing smiles and warm, upbeat talk of 
"tremendous opportunity" and "marvelous" occurrences. At times she is almost 
effusive, but she can and does occasionally break through with a tough, blunt 
statement. Such was her manner in describing what happened after the war when 
she saw the newsreels about the death camps and learned the fate of the 
relatives she and her father had been praying for at the end of each day. 
</P>
<P>
"God died a very painful death -- for me," she said tersely. The old model 
having failed for her, she spent her life unsystematically searching for 
something else, a mythos, or system of beliefs, that would give life meaning. 
After her collapse, she got organized about it. 
</P>
<P>
Examining existing research in archeology, religion, myth and art, she made the 
connections out of which her theory of a peaceful world organized on a 
partnership model evolved. While it's true that her hypotheses have been 
dismissed or ignored by many in the mainstream scientific community, she does 
have her supporters, including anthropologist Ashley Montagu, who called her 
book "the most important work since Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' " 
</P>
<P>
The book has seemed to take on a life of its own, spawning a movement that, 
some observers express vague fears, could turn into something of a cult. 
</P>
<P>
Eisler herself seems a woman at a crossroads now, the center of much attention 
and adulation, faced, perhaps unexpectedly, with the possibility of becoming a 
guru. She seems pulled at times, enjoying the success and limelight, yet 
claiming she is no organizer, and that the whole concept of guruism is 
antithetical to the partnership model. 
</P>
<P>
The center held its first public event several weeks ago at a church in Santa 
Monica. A turnaway crowd of about 600 came to hear Eisler and Margaret 
Papandreou, ex-wife of former Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and a 
feminist peace activist working with Women for a Meaningful Summit. The two 
women, and their mutual organizations, are co-sponsoring a partnership 
conference and festival in Crete in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dominator Model 
</P>
<P>
The audience seemed a mixture of starry-eyed dreamers, some with the 
distinctive look of what is loosely called the New Age, and politically minded 
activists involved in the nitty-gritty of movements for social change. 
</P>
<P>
Eisler gave an overview of her theories, stressing the connections between the 
personal and political, warning "you can't graft the ecological movement, 
feminist movement, peace movement onto a model based on forced domination." 
</P>
<P>
The dominator model has gone into self-destruct, she said. Under such a system, 
she said, current problems such as dysfunctional families and co-dependency are 
not personal but social problems. Society itself, she said, is in denial on a 
global level. The evidence is around us in the population explosion, the 
destruction of the rain forests, the threat of ecological collapse and nuclear 
holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
She was smiling and upbeat as she delivered those apocalyptic words. She seems 
to have visualized the future and, sounding convinced, told people to reclaim 
their history, and shape the future with it: "You're in for an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
She got a strangely moving standing ovation at the end. The audience did not 
leap to its feet. Rather, one by one, serious-looking older women, the type of 
citizens who have unfailingly provided the labor for social causes and 
community work, receiving little credit over the years, rose to their feet. Not 
a smile, not a tear, not a starry eye among them, they just stood there 
solemnly applauding a message it seemed they had known and been waiting to hear 
articulated all of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Carmel, curled up on an apricot velvet couch with her legs tucked under 
her, Eisler was no less smiling and upbeat. At times her manner obscures the 
seriousness of her research and her credentials. This is someone who has 
experienced more than a little of the dark side of life. 
</P>
<P>
She has, however, come through, and so it is in a rather light and circuitous 
manner that she tells her life story, details her research and describes what's 
next. At one point she laughed at all the detours she was taking and 
distractions that were occurring, and remarked that "this is a bit like the 
book. It's not linear." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband David wandered in and out from time to time, offering commentary at 
one point, tea at another and later bringing a plate of mango slices, telling 
Eisler to mind her energy. 
</P>
<P>
"You see," she smiled, when he had left to make peppermint tea, "the kind of 
relationship we have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Refugee Child' 
</P>
<P>
A heroine to many feminists, especially those of a spiritual bent, and 
decidedly a feminist herself, her central image and driving force remains the 
fact she was "a refugee child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The world changed forever for her on Kristallnacht, in November, 1938, when the 
Nazis came to her home, beat and arrested her father. Her mother managed to get 
him released through sheer courage and bravado, which, Eisler said, is the 
greatest gift, other than life, that her mother gave her. 
</P>
<P>
They fled to Havana, where she, "an alien little kid with long braids," went to 
a Methodist school and heard fire and brimstone in chapel, watched her Catholic 
friends go to confession, and remained terrified of the violence of the street 
kids and sexual pawing of men she passed in the slum streets where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is not ennobling" is her blunt summary of those lessons. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Los Angeles with her parents when she was 14, finished high school 
and UCLA and started law school. She dropped out when she married George 
Eisler, she said. They had two daughters, Loren and Andrea, both of whom now 
live in Southern California. For a while, she tried to make a go of being "a 
conventional wife in the suburbs. I was not good at it." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to UCLA law school, graduated in 1967 and went to work for an 
entertainment law firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I had zilch consciousness about women," she said of herself then. When one of 
the partners in the firm paid her the supreme compliment that she did not think 
like a woman, she said, "I thought, 'Yummy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Saying she began to wake up, it is clear she did so with a vengeance. She quit 
her job, marriage and smoking, she said, in the space of three months in 1967. 
Noticing a classified ad looking for an attorney to help start a women's law 
center, she went to an organizing meeting and "jumped in feet first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feminist Activist 
</P>
<P>
She became a feminist activist, raising her children, becoming a founding 
director of the L.A. Women's Center Legal Program, serving on the board of a 
women's clinic, teaching a class on the social and legal status of women at 
UCLA, lecturing, writing and producing feminist plays, and writing two books, 
"Dissolution," and the "Equal Rights Handbook." 
</P>
<P>
"Dissolution," she said, accurately predicted the disaster that no-fault 
divorce would be for women, given their inequality in marriage and society. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in all of that activity, her parents died within eight months of each 
other. She collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"I got terribly ill. It was a complete physical and emotional breakdown, 
probably predictable, but not by me." 
</P>
<P>
She came to a total halt, she said, had to give up practicing law and turned to 
the business of healing herself. When she was still ill, she met David Loye, 
then on the faculty at UCLA Medical School. Loye had entered the room when she 
was nearing this part of her story and she asked him to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I quickly realized, besides falling in love with her," Loye said, "I 
recognized, 'This woman is going to do something important. I've got to help 
her.' I dropped my work for a year, took the stress out of her system as much 
as I could, defused tensions for her so the natural healing could take over and 
collaborated on the ERA handbook." 
</P>
<P>
It has been like that ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"David, he who helped heal me," Eisler said, sounding in awe at her good 
fortune, "is also a social psychologist and futurist. He is a fantastic 
in-house resource for me. A lot of the theoretical work couldn't have developed 
with as much precision if I hadn't had you." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's true," he answered her. "I knew the standards she had to meet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Program 
</P>
<P>
With "The Chalice &amp; the Blade" already working in her, she said, they moved 
to Carmel and she set to work on a structured research program. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in isolation. It was tremendously important. I couldn't have done it 
in a university -- there was no preconceived paradigm and the vastness of the 
area would have been frowned on." 
</P>
<P>
She read everything. "It was like sifting for gold," she said. "So many sources 
were not feminist sources. It was there, but it was buried and I was trying to 
find it. I'm not an archeologist, but I dug." 
</P>
<P>
Her training as a lawyer helped her as much as her feminist instincts, she 
said. She can recognize patterns and systems, and was able to make 
correlations, for example between the "strongman" rule of family and state. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, I think the book is a brief or argument: here is the evidence. 
This is what you do when you prepare a case, and underneath all of this was the 
passion." 
</P>
<P>
She worked in isolation from academe, but not from her husband. He has written 
his own books, among them "The Sphinx and the Rainbow: Brain, Mind and Future 
Vision," and "The Healing of a Nation," the latter on race relations, and is at 
work on another, but he and Eisler work closely together. 
</P>
<P>
He played a major part in editing and advising on "The Chalice &amp; the 
Blade," and they are developing further papers based on it, such as a recent 
one on economics. They both have been involved in founding the center and 
setting its policy, and he also seems to manage and promote, to some degree, 
Eisler's career direction at this point. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted her to be taken seriously in the scientific community, 
encouraged her to develop a theory of "cultural transformation" in "The Chalice 
&amp; the Blade," which she did, based on the chaos theory in the new physics 
that deals with how systems organize and change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Risk Worth Taking' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a risk worth taking," he said, in that it broadened the book's appeal 
beyond a feminist community. "It would force men on the leading edge of science 
to pay a little attention. This has happened. I interwove it (the chaos theory) 
and I think it works. I've seen enough of the male scientific world to have 
much hope in it for the future of the world. I worked overtime to get Riane 
into that setting, form an alliance with those guys. It may get more of this 
perspective into that vital connection." 
</P>
<P>
He was proud of her recent appearance before a group of prominent Soviets and 
Americans at a UC Berkeley conference on human rights earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Before a mostly male group, she was one of the few to raise the question of 
women's rights, and it took guts, Loye said. Whether it is a Soviet emphasis on 
economic rights as human rights, or an American emphasis on political rights, 
both keep it in the public arena, far from the domain of wife beating, purdah, 
rape, child abuse, sexual segregation. 
</P>
<P>
"My point," Eisler said, "is if people are brought up in a household where 
human rights violations are commonplace, people like that are not going to 
respect the human rights of a stranger." 
</P>
<P>
She is pleased to speak before such influential groups and wants to see the 
center, with a speakers bureau, recognized in a similar fashion. ("I need to be 
cloned," she said.) The center itself, besides the Crete conference, is 
planning a partnership and the family conference in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that David and I step back and that others come forward," she 
said of the center. She is not an organization person or administrator, she 
said. She longs for the day someone else will take over, and insists it will 
not be hard to let go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Direction 
</P>
<P>
At times, those familiar with her express concern about the direction she may 
be going in. They are more uneasy than convinced, do not want to be quoted, but 
vaguely wonder if she is not becoming a self-promoter, liking the limelight, 
getting too connected with what they disparagingly see as New Age cultism and 
fuzziness. 
</P>
<P>
Eisler herself warns of co-option, and says any system is tainted with the 
dominator model and cannot be taken on wholesale. And that includes the New 
Age, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern with guruism is dominator stuff, not to speak of the charlatanism. 
It diverts people to ways of life that do not transform society." 
</P>
<P>
She has several other books to write, all stemming from "The Chalice" and she 
wants to get at them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has found she is at her highest self, transcending her own limits, when she 
is being truly creative. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm at my best, I'm an instrument. I think the work that has been given 
me to do is truly integrative work. All these various pieces of my life have 
been integrated and transformed. Not that I've arrived, let me hasten to add. 
No woman of my generation is truly liberated. We carry a lot of dominator 
baggage with us. But there is a true spiritual dimension (to this work). Not 
otherworldly, but illuminating our experience right here on this beautiful 
planet." 
</P>

ARCHITECTURE: COMPETITIONS: POTENTIAL GLORY, BUT WITH A PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an architect enters a design competition, he enters a realm that mixes 
risk and opportunity. The competition may be open to anyone who wishes to 
enter, attracting hundreds of jostling hopefuls. Or it may be by invitation 
only, limited to a select few. Either way, the designer tests his mettle 
against his peers in naked contest. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Frank Gehry won the competition for his daring design of Disney Hall 
last December, he was shocked at having finally broken through the barrier of 
resistance he had long experienced in his home town against his unorthodox 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if I would ever have been chosen to design Disney Hall directly," he 
said. "It was the competition that made it possible for me to win such an 
establishment commission. It allowed me to show my paces up against stiff 
opposition from some of the best designers around, and it allowed the selection 
committee to justify choosing me by such comparison." 
</P>
<P>
Architectural competitions have become the rage of the 1980s. Hotly competitive 
contests create an air of excitement and generate publicity. "These 
competitions," said New York architect Charles Gwathmey, "give clients a big 
bang for the buck." They even may, if the process of choice is truly open and 
unbiased, result in a far better building than might have happened in the 
usual, noncompetitive fashion by influence, connection or reputation. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, designers for many major Southern California commercial and 
cultural buildings have been selected through widely publicized contests. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Moore and the Urban Innovations Group swept away the competition to 
land the Beverly Hills Civic Center in 1983; Arata Isozaki, a Japanese 
architect who had never worked in the United States, took the Museum of 
Contemporary Art prize in 1983; New Yorker Richard Meier won The Getty Center 
for the Fine Arts in 1984, even before he won the Pritzker Prize; the rebel 
SITE Projects Inc. seized first prize for the renovation of Pershing Square; 
and new-wave architects Morphosis, Craig Hodgetts, Ming Fung and Adele Santos 
walked away with several surprisingly staid projects. 
</P>
<P>
But competitions appeal to clients and architects for distinctly different 
reasons. "Every competition organizer has a chance to see his dream come true 
-- to discover the architect who can create the most beautiful building in the 
world," Hilde De Haan and Ids Haagsma write in their book "Architects in 
Competition." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Pittas, former design director of the National Endowment for the Arts 
and organizer for the Vietnam War Memorial, Pershing Square and the West 
Hollywood Civic Center competitions, added: "Design contests are a way of 
achieving a political and aesthetic consensus in a possibly contentious 
project. And they are great PR, with their juries of high-profile designers and 
influential lay people. For the money spent, usually between $100,000 to 
$500,000, they offer great value." 
</P>
<P>
For younger and less-known designers, winning a competition offers a fast track 
to the big time. Albuquerque's Antoine Predock, for example, leaped from 
honorable obscurity to international recognition after winning four major 
competitions in five years. Yale architecture student Maya Lin won fame with 
her winning design for the Washington, D.C., Vietnam War Memorial in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous instance of instant reputation is Australia's Sydney 
Opera House. In 1956, little-known Dane Jorn Utzon designed the remarkable 
structure, shaped like a schooner in full sail, that has become a national 
icon. 
</P>
<P>
But Utzon wouldn't have won without architect Eero Saarinen, a powerful 
personality who dominated the Opera House jury. The masterful modernist rescued 
Utzon's radical design from the reject pile and proclaimed to his intimidated 
fellow jurors: "This is your opera house, gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a downside. "The design requirements in a competition are 
necessarily sketchy," Pittas said, "considering that it lacks the intimate 
interaction between a client and a designer. And there is no doubt that 
architects are exploited by taking part in competitions that only really pay 
off for the winners." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry estimates he spent around $150,000 in time and materials preparing his 
Disney design. Having won the commission, his investment paid off. On the other 
hand, his entry for the Beverly Hills Civic Center contest cost him the same 
amount, but he only received one-tenth of his outlay when he didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expense Continues 
</P>
<P>
The expense and possible heartbreak doesn't always end with winning a 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
When Barton Myers won the 1985 competition for the new Phoenix Municipal 
Government Center, beating out several heavyweight rivals, he was buoyed up on 
a bubble of euphoria. Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard raved about Myers' design, 
describing it as "a mirror to the city, showing us what we are and what we can 
be." 
</P>
<P>
The brilliant scheme was published in professional journals around the world as 
a model of urban design. Four years and hundreds of hours of work later, Myers' 
design was killed by a provincial city council that refused to fund it. 
"Nothing in recent memory has shown in such exquisite detail how Phoenix city 
government operates as has the way Goddard and his befuddled council have 
stumbled around trying to build a city hall," declared a columnist in the 
Phoenix New Times. "Myers has fashioned a true monument to city life, which 
will now never be built." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delayed the Start 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, vocal neighborhood opposition has delayed the start of the West 
Hollywood Civic Center. Though a majority of the city council now supports the 
design, its future is very much in doubt, and with it the careers of the two 
young Boston architects who carried off first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, competitions are as old as the art of architecture. In 
the 5th Century B.C., the Athenians began to design the Acropolis with 
competitions for the Parthenon. In 1792, there was a contest for young 
America's new White House, and in 1971, Pompidou Center in Paris rose from an 
international design match. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, modern competitions in the U.S. are either open to any designer or 
limited to a few invitees. Competitors may go through several stages of 
selection: a first stage to gather the widest possible range of entries and 
ideas, and a second level for a selected group of first-stage finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Hall competition was limited to four dazzling invitees. The Pershing 
Square and West Hollywood contests were wide open competitions that drew more 
than 200 entries apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-stage competition, the entries are blind; that is, the submitted 
drawings are unsigned. The second stage involves an in-depth interview in which 
the finalists can personally explain their designs to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Interview 
</P>
<P>
"The interview is crucial in the selection process," Pittas said. "The jury 
sees the warm bodies behind the cold sketches, can assess the personalities of 
the competitors, and gain a sense of his or her competence, or lack thereof. 
Many a brilliant entry has been scuttled by an incoherent personal 
presentation." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the pros and cons of architectural competitions after a decade of 
experience, Pittas said: "You can't underestimate the powerful impact of a 
multiplicity of solutions to the same design program from many inventive minds. 
Juries are electrified. There is no alternative way to duplicate this 
excitement in the choosing of an architect for an important commission."

'TOSCA' OPERA PATRONS HONORED AT NATHANSON DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This doesn't feel like a stuffy opera party," declared Nancy Vreeland, as her 
eyes scanned the room of tuxedoed men and elegantly dressed women. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a stuffy opera," replied her friend. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the formality of clothes and major jewels, there was little stuffiness 
at the home of Jane and Marc Nathanson on Saturday night when 130 Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera supporters met for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"At the opening-night gala, there are going to be thousands of people there," 
said Joan Hotchkis, co-chairman of the gala along with Vreeland, and "we wanted 
to have something more intimate for our patrons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collection of Art 
</P>
<P>
Those with $1,000 tickets to see the premiere of "Tosca" Sept. 6 also were 
invited to this party, where guests were appropriately awed by the Nathansons' 
collection of modern art. While chatting in the living room, it was hard to 
miss the Ed Ruscha above the mantle. Two Frank Stellas dominated the entry way 
and on a far wall was Andy Warhol's portrait of Jane Nathanson. 
</P>
<P>
Placido Domingo, who will conduct "Tosca," was the evening's guest of honor. 
The celebrated tenor flew in from performing in Salzburg, Austria, will 
rehearse for a few days here, then fly back to Salzburg for a final performance 
before his Los Angeles opening. 
</P>
<P>
"After three seasons, we can talk about L.A. having an opera," said Domingo. 
"What's very beautiful about the people in Los Angeles, they like all kinds of 
repertoire. You'd think that they'd only like the most popular operas, but it's 
not true. It's a wonderful advantage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courtyard Service 
</P>
<P>
Guests were served dinner in the courtyard, flanked by a modern sculpture and 
two basketball hoops. Dining on curried chicken served in scooped-out pineapple 
halves were former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon; Tom and Esther 
Wachtell; Jane and Peter Hemmings (the opera's general director); Chantal 
Kilroy; Tara Colburn; Edye and Eli Broad; Suzanne Marx and Jack Lowrance; Terri 
and Timothy Childs; Georgiana and Ricardo Montalban; Gerald and Robin Parsky; 
Wendy and Leonard Goldberg; and Pippa Scott and friends Marvin Antonowsky, 
Fabienne Schwalbe, Douglas Schwalbe and Mary Anne Schwalbe, who had stopped 
their limo at the bottom of the hill before the party to get a good glimpse of 
Candy and Aaron Spelling's ultra-mansion. 
</P>
<P>
There was even a romantic touch to the evening: Longtime couple Peggy Parker 
and Walter Grauman announced their engagement.

GALLERY OPENING BENEFITS L.A. ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROUILLARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studio Leonardogavinci, an art gallery in the mid-Wilshire area, is owned by 
artists Leonardo Chalupowicz and Gavin Dillard, who also go under the name 
Leonardogavinci. And, in their spare time, these Leonardogavincis are also 
animal-rights activists. Last Thursday evening they turned over their gallery 
to 11 artists who, in various media, celebrated their relationships with other 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "other species" present were Rio, a 10-foot Burmese python, who was 
the life of the "Animal Rites" benefit opening. Rio knows about partying. Rio, 
it seems, has appeared in the pornographic movie "Stryker Force." Dillard, the 
python's owner, said that Rio would be continuing his career. Rio also appeared 
in the October, 1988, issue of Playgirl magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Rio, like many big stars, just hung around, seemingly indifferent to the 
relentless attentions of the crowd at the Studio Leonardogavinci. When it came 
time, however, for a photograph to be taken, Rio, like many stars, came to 
attention and was suddenly animated and friendly. He flirted with artist Rachel 
Rosenthal, who, later in the evening, performed a piece entitled "Zatoichi," 
the story of her elderly poodle who refused to die -- but eventually did. 
Rosenthal was not joined by her pet rat, Tatti Wattles, who often accompanied 
her during performances. Yes, T.W. has passed on also. 
</P>
<P>
Animal-rights consciousness expressed itself in many forms during the unusual 
event. Furniture designers Jeff Goodman and Stephen Charlton were sorry they 
hadn't brought their white toy poodle, who, they felt, has a right to get out 
more often. "She would've loved that snake," said Charlton, "and she always 
likes tragic stories about other poodles." 
</P>
<P>
Art collector Karen Barone expressed her concern for animal rights by wearing a 
Mylar snakeskin bathing suit. "I prefer the Mylar and gold foil variety of 
snake," said Barone. Rio, nearby, seemed nonplused. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the exhibit were donated to a host of animal-rights 
organizations, including the Humane Society, Greenpeace and People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), whose executive director, Kim Stallwood, 
had flown in from Washington, D.C. for the event. Stallwood announced at 
approximately 9:30 p.m. that "fur was dead." As a fashion statement, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Animal activist Chantal Cloutier, whose agency represents top stylists, make-up 
artists and hairdressers, remarked that "it is no longer fashionable to wear 
fur. Fun fur won't even be fashionable soon." Cloutier will not even accept 
bookings that include fur. "One of my artists has to take his fur bookings at 
home. I won't get involved in it," Cloutier insisted. Cloutier works closely 
with PETA and Stallwood and was involved in the recently successful campaign 
against the cosmetic companies to stop using animals in product research. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Labelle, the brother of animal-rights activist artist Charles Labelle, 
brought three tiny kittens to the opening, hoping they would be adopted. They 
were picked up for inspection immediately. Several potential adoptive parents 
were not quite sure they were ready for yet another cat. Rio, hanging around 
nearby, expressed his concern for the kittens' fortunes by flicking his forked 
tongue hungrily.

Two Orange County residents were critically burned Sunday when their small 
plane crashed just after takeoff from Long Beach Municipal Airport and was 
engulfed by flames. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Angelo Calderone, 65, of Los Alamitos and his passenger, Delores Hartley, 
44, of Costa Mesa, were taken to Memorial Hospital of Long Beach in "extremely 
critical condition" with second- and third-degree burns over most of their 
bodies, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Calderone suffered burns over 60% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley, who later Sunday was transferred to the burn unit at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, suffered burns over 90% of her body. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration were looking into the 
cause of the crash Sunday, and officials from the National Transportation 
Safety Board were expected to join the inquiry today. 
</P>
<P>
But a Long Beach Fire Department official who was at the scene said their 
investigators believe Calderone's single-engine plane, a Piper Tomahawk, was 
hit by a strong gust of wind just after he took off from Runway 25L. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane's stall buzzer sounded, Calderone reacted properly, bringing the 
nose of the airplane down, Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. But then 
Calderone apparently lost control of the plane and, at 1:27 p.m. Sunday, it 
slammed nose first into a field near the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the crash, flames shot out of the engine compartment, raced 
into the cockpit and burned onto the right wing, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five firefighters responded from a station one-eighth of a mile from the 
airport. They sprayed foam on the flames, "popping the door" on Calderone's 
side and dragging him out of the plane, Caldon said. But Hartley was trapped 
inside as the plane continued to burn. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, using a Jaws of Life hydraulic prying device, firefighters were able 
to cut Hartley out of airplane, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Calderone was taken by Lifeflight helicopter to Memorial, where he was admitted 
to the intensive-care unit. Hartley was transported by ambulance to Memorial, 
then transferred to UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll get better care there," Memorial spokesman Ron Yukelson said. "We don't 
have a burn-specific unit." 
</P>
<P>
Caldon said controllers in the Long Beach airport's observation tower watched 
the plane crash Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Both he and an FAA spokesman said they did not know where the small plane was 
going or how much experience Calderone has as a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Calderone nor Hartley was able to explain what led to the crash, but on 
the way to the hospital, Caldon said, Hartley talked a little, mentioning to 
paramedics that "she heard the (stall) buzzer sounding just before the 
accident."

DIFFERENCES ARE STARKLY EVIDENT BETWEEN EZELL, SUCCESSOR AT INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Davidian may be as much of a Republican Party loyalist as his predecessor, 
but that's where the similarity ends between him and the man he replaced as the 
top immigration official in the West, the colorful Harold Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian isn't going to sing in public as Ezell did. 
</P>
<P>
He's not going to dance with Imelda Marcos or anyone else who might be 
controversial or under public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he had a sombrero, Davidian -- mindful that Ezell, a Laguna Hills 
resident, occasionally donned one -- nervously chuckled and eyed the 
questioner's tape recorder. "Shut that thing off," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Davidian, 38, quickly showed in his first week on the job as the new 
Western regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
that he will be a different sort of public servant than the 52-year-old Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"You could immediately tell a difference," said one INS staffer, who was 
surprised to find Davidian at his desk for an unannounced introduction shortly 
after the new commissioner reported to work. "Ezell was a little loosy goosy -- 
I guess that's how he got into trouble. Davidian was friendly and all that, but 
I got the sense he isn't going to say weird things. He has his guard up." 
</P>
<P>
Staffers still shake their heads at one Ezell classic, which caused Latino 
activists to call for his dismissal. Describing a streamlined screening process 
for aliens at the border, Ezell said in 1986: "If you catch 'em, you ought to 
clean 'em and fry 'em yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In an informal chat at the INS regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel, Davidian 
said he will have a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be a lower profile," said the former chairman of the California 
Agriculture Labor Relations Board. "I'll probably do most of my management here 
in this building and in the other (INS) offices." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian declined to be drawn into a discussion on immigration policy issues or 
his personal views on such volatile subjects as amnesty or the controversial 
INS roundups of illegal immigrants on the streets where they congregate to ask 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
He said he preferred to wait until attorney Gene McNary, the elected chief 
executive officer of St. Louis County, Mo., is confirmed as the new INS 
commissioner. McNary was nominated earlier this month to succeed Alan Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
So, the conversation centered on his background, his 2 1/2 years as chairman of 
the ALRB and, to an extent, his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
On the last count, he was quick to praise Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner Ezell did a pretty darn good job here," Davidian said, noting 
that Ezell has been personally credited with persuading many illegals to sign 
up for amnesty under the initial phase of the 1986 immigration reform law. 
About 60% of the 3 million who applied came from the INS Western Region of 
California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
"He was faced with the most sweeping change in immigration law in the history 
of this country," Davidian continued. "It required a whole policy . . . the 
biggest task being going out there and getting people to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"In the process, he became high profile." 
</P>
<P>
But Davidian would not reply directly when asked if he might scrap his low-key 
style to ensure that all of the 1.8 million aliens who signed up in the West 
complete the amnesty program's Phase II requirements of knowledge of English 
and U.S. history. "That's one of the highest priorities of this agency," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On other topics, Davidian: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he planned no wholesale changes within the agency's ranks, but he 
emphatically reminded INS employees that it is not solely an enforcer of the 
nation's immigration laws. "We are also a service agency," he said. "People 
can't go around waiting years for the greatest prize that this country can 
bestow on someone, citizenship, only to be treated rudely by someone at a front 
counter. That just isn't acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
* Asked INS critics, who charge that the agency is anti-Latino, not to be too 
harsh. "Give us a chance," he said. "Give us a little time. I don't think it's 
as negative as it used to be. If there's a negative image, it's getting better. 
You can't be an enforcement agency and please everybody. You can't do that. All 
you can do is to carry out the law within the policies of the Bush 
Administration as fairly and appropriately as we can. And every now and then, 
somebody's going to be upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rejected the suggestion from critics of his tenure as ALRB chairman that he had 
no appreciation for farm workers. "That is hot and dusty work," he said, 
recalling a summer of picking pears in Apple Valley as a youth. "And when I was 
able to do something else, I did something else. I'm not going to try and tell 
you that I have a lot of experience in the fields, but my short experience 
tells me that's a damn hard way to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, a lawyer by training who spent four years as a flight navigator in 
the Air Force, grew particularly testy when he was reminded of charges by 
ranking officials of the United Farm Workers of America that he was pro-grower 
since he was appointed to the ALRB in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned if Dolores Huerta (UFW co-founder and first vice president) 
thinks that I'm anti-Latino because she is wrong," he said. "I read someplace 
where someone said that 97% of my decisions was pro-grower. That's absolute 
foolishness. If you read them, the majority of my decisions were rendered for 
the farm workers. A lot of growers were mad after a case went against them and 
they called the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"And some of the angriest recommended me in letters to the White House for this 
job. They told me, 'We've come to view you as a fair man.' " 
</P>
<P>
A UFW spokesman said that the ALRB under Davidian investigated fewer complaints 
filed by the union than previously. "He can say all he wants, but the fact is 
farm workers are not better off today because of Mr. Davidian and his pals in 
the Deukmejian Administration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised by Some 
</P>
<P>
In his first week, Davidian was praised by some INS executives as a quick study 
who knows more about immigration issues than he lets on. "He's asked some very 
probing questions," one agency executive said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Fresno who won his political stripes on the campaigns of prominent 
GOP stars, including former President Ronald Reagan, President Bush and 
California Gov. George Deukmejian, Davidian cuts a different physical presence 
than Ezell. While the stout, older Ezell used his hands and arms to punctuate a 
conversation, the erect Davidian seemed less gregarious, according to INS 
employees who met him last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't strike me as the type you'd invite out for a beer," one staffer 
said. Then he amended his thoughts: "Well, maybe we should."

IGNORE THE BIG, SCARY INSECTS; THE LITTLE ONES CAUSE ALL THE TROUBLE

<P>
Fred Beams was at the beach in Dana Point when he noticed a mother and her 
daughter near hysterics about a giant, flying green bug. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just panicked," he said. "They were waving their arms up and down 
trying to get it. They thought it was a bee." 
</P>
<P>
But Beams, the assistant manager of the Orange County Vector Control District, 
knew the bug was a harmless green fig beetle. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Please don't be alarmed by what they are,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Beams admitted the creature is "one of the scarier beetles. They have that 
green color. In fact, in Egypt, they once used them as money." 
</P>
<P>
Summer is the prime time for spotting the green fig beetle. At this time of the 
year, when the ground gets warmer and the winds are calm, beetles, bugs, 
spiders and ants seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the climate so attractive for people here makes it attractive for 
bugs," Beams said. "All insects are temperature dependent. Here it is warm year 
round so they can survive." 
</P>
<P>
Although bugs are more active and reproduce at a greater rate in the summer, 
many do little to harm people except to scare them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all big and scary and look like they'll take a small child," Beams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Vector Control District's worries are over smaller bugs: 
mosquitoes. Almost any still water outdoors can be a breeding ground. Vector 
Control workers have been spraying areas such as the San Joaquin marshes near 
UC Irvine and salt marshes near Huntington and Seal beaches. 
</P>
<P>
They have a more difficult time tracking places such as unkept pools and golf 
course hazards, which are on private property. So far this summer, they have 
found 3,500 such pools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of control over people's back yards," Beams said. "It's 
really up to the homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
Unkept pools can produce 150,000 to 200,000 mosquitoes a week, Beams said. 
Mosquitoes even have enough room in a coffee can of water to breed 700 to 1,000 
offspring a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For exterminators, most of the problems this summer have been indoors. Fleas 
and ants have been especially prolific. 
</P>
<P>
"It really kind of hit this year," said Phil Naman, the acting manager of 
Terminix's Costa Mesa branch. "When it's hot and dry, they just go crazy. 
Everybody who calls us says they've got the worst cases in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rankin of Santa Ana, owner of Freckles the dog and Frosty the cat, said 
he has battled fleas with pesticides for so long, "I figure my yard is a toxic 
waste dump by now." 
</P>
<P>
But Rankin's problems go beyond fleas. His big problem this year has been June 
bugs. Rankin recently planted some cherry brush trees, and soon the June bugs 
were out to attack. They created blister-like bumps on the the trees' leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had (lots of) June bugs," he said. "They suck all the goodness out of 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time of the Year for Ants 
</P>
<P>
This also is the time of the year when ants move from back yards and into 
homes. Lee Clifton, the vice president of Hydrex Pest Control of California, 
said his company is receiving more calls from hot, dry areas such as Anaheim 
Hills, Placentia and Yorba Linda, where ants are fleeing their normal habitats 
for the cool indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Cockroaches also like to infest homes. One of the most common, the Oriental 
cockroach, also known as the black beetle or black water bug, is found in cool, 
damp areas such as water meter boxes and dense vegetation. And Orange County 
has plenty of American and German cockroaches, which can destroy food, fabrics 
and book bindings. 
</P>
<P>
But, Beams said, "I'll take a cockroach any day over a housefly." Houseflies 
carry germs, and can land on exposed food and regurgitate. 
</P>
<P>
Some pests also carry diseases. The most publicized this summer has been the 
Western black-legged tick, a known carrier of Lyme disease. One Laguna Beach 
woman was suspected of having the disease, but a recent test proved negative. 
Even so, the tick has been found in places all over the county that have deer, 
which are known carriers of the tick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ash Whitefly Arrives 
</P>
<P>
Another new arrival is the ash whitefly, first discovered in the county late 
last year. The ash whitefly attaches itself to the underside of leaves and can 
slowly kill trees. The flies secrete a honeydew that causes black, sooty mold 
to form on citrus, peach and other fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly, which is native to the Mediterranean region, has grown 
rapidly this summer because it has no natural enemies in Southern California, 
said Nick Nisson, an entomologist at the Orange County Agricultural 
Commissioner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Being new and being exotic, it doesn't really have the parasites to keep it in 
check," Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly also is almost impossible to kill without soaking the entire 
plant in insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasp Will Be Captured 
</P>
<P>
To combat the ash whitefly, state officials are sending an entomologist to 
France and Italy next month to capture the Encarsia, a smaller than 
pinhead-sized wasp that is the insect's natural enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rankin isn't particularly fond of any of these creatures. He's having 
enough trouble just identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had these bugs that are green and fly," he said. "Some of these things 
are bigger than baseballs. They'll knock you over. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord knows what can live out there."

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: WEEKEND TREKS UP DISNEYLAND'S MATTERHORN KEEP HIS 
LIFE IN BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Nosalek needs a break from his two jobs, from the freeway traffic crush 
and from the pace of his everyday life. So every weekend, he climbs a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has climbed the 147-foot Matterhorn at Disneyland every weekend for 
the last 3 1/2 years. The climb takes just 30 minutes, so he does it four times 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, the Matterhorn at Disneyland is similar to other mountains and in 
some cases can be more slippery and more difficult than real mountains," he 
said. "There are some areas of the Matterhorn I haven't climbed yet." 
</P>
<P>
Before he began his weekend job at Disneyland, Nosalek had scaled the 
14,512-foot backside of Mount Whitney and once climbed part of the real 
14,690-foot Matterhorn when he lived in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Nosalek was born and raised in West Germany, and his mother was a guide in the 
Austrian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
"You go through different feelings when you climb real mountains and the one at 
Disneyland," said Nosalek, 27, of Huntington Beach. "The scenery is 
breathtaking, and you can't help but realize how small your are. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unbelieveable feeling when you reach the top of the peak of a real 
mountain. It's hard work, but it's well worth it and it's plain fun." 
</P>
<P>
But Nosalek said the Disneyland Matterhorn continues to thrill him and the 
other seven climbers who regularly scale the man-made peak on weekends to 
entertain the crowds below. 
</P>
<P>
"On the clearest day you can see Catalina, the Hollywood sign and the 
skyscrapers in Los Angeles," he said. "And we can hear all the sounds from the 
crowd below." 
</P>
<P>
Nosalek said climbing real mountains "taught me how to push myself, and I found 
I have a lot more energy and perseverance than I thought I had. It's like an 
avalanche. You have strength inside that you didn't know you had." 
</P>
<P>
He also found "climbing relaxes my mind and allows for a lot of reflecting 
during rest times." 
</P>
<P>
During the week, Nosalek is an account executive for an advertising agency and 
operates his own computer consulting service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard work to juggle everything, and time management is important," he 
said. "I have many goals and financial independence is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Another is a college education, which was put on hold. "Schooling was 
interfering with my career," said Nosalek, who once attended Fullerton College. 
"I was blessed with some incredible opportunities and couldn't pass them up." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Miller, 58, believes in body language and said it helped when he joined 
the Marine Corps 40 years ago as an enlisted man and realized he would be 
better off as an officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the library and read a book on body language, and it said one way to 
get a position was to act, look and use language of the position you wanted," 
recalled the Brea resident. He was later commissioned as an officer. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's giving talks on body language to various Orange County groups. He 
often throws in a little humor during his talks such as the one he gave 
recently to the Brea Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said there's a good chance people are lying if they touch 
their face below the bridge of their nose and above the lip. But he points out, 
"Of course they could just have a cold." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his human interaction talks, as he calls them, Miller sometimes 
works as a stand-up comedian in area comedy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real challenge to get up in front of people and make them laugh, 
especially when you're double and triple the age of most of the audience," he 
said. "But it does sharpen me up for my other talks." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Cathy Lee, 33, of Huntington Beach, who was born deaf, later 
this month will have a new companion in Rosie, a certified hearing ear dog. The 
$3,500 to train and place the 18-month-old German shorthair pointer was donated 
by the White Rose Rebekah Lodge in Solvang. The dog was given to Dogs for the 
Deaf in Central Point, Ore., by an anonymous donor.

TWO SIDES DIG IN FOR FIGHT ON TAX MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle lines have been drawn for what promises to be a hotly contested, 
multimillion-dollar fight over a plan to pay for $11.6 billion worth of 
transportation improvements with a half-cent increase in the county sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the county registrar of voters office will decide today which of 
two position papers opposed to the plan will be placed on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, known as Measure M, seeks to increase the sales tax from 6% to 6.5%, 
raising a $3.1-billion down payment on a far-reaching, $11.6-billion plan to 
speed traffic with wider freeways, more car-pool lanes and streamlined streets, 
plus commuter rail service. The tax increase would cost the average county 
consumer about $50 to $75 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters expect to spend at least $1 million to push the plan, while critics 
hope to raise $100,000 to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
Those involved in such ballot-initiative campaigns believe that the supporting 
and opposing statements posed to voters in the polls and the names that go with 
the statements can have a considerable effect on voters. 
</P>
<P>
The filing deadline for such positions was Friday. One opposition position 
paper, calling the measure an "attack on your pocketbooks" that would only help 
those owning land near proposed highways, was offered by Ted Gwartney of 
Anaheim, who identified himself as chairman of the Committee to Reduce Consumer 
Taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The other opposition statement came from a group made up primarily of 
individuals who have been identified with the county slow-growth movement: 
Brian J. Rice, mayor of San Clemente; Sandra L. Genis, member of the Costa Mesa 
City Council; Norman Z. Eckenrode, mayor pro tem of Placentia; Robert F. 
Dinsen, mayor pro tem of Garden Grove, and Russell Burkett of the Orange County 
Taxfighters Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The group called Measure M the latest "taxscam" from special interest groups 
and said it would mean far greater debts and more taxes later for county 
residents, as well as "more dangerous, expensive diamond lanes and busways" and 
"planned gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
The group also called the plan "a downpayment on disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Signing the statement that is to appear in support of Measure M were Tom 
Rogers, a slow-growth activist who helped defeat a sales-tax transportation

<P>
Rogers and Burkett, neighbors and friends in San Juan Capistrano, have been 
closely linked on the slow-growth issue but find themselves on opposite sides 
on Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a strange position to be in," Burkett said, "but it's an honest 
difference of opinion over what this plan would mean for the county. . . . I 
understand that Tom worked hard to try and modify the plan and that after the 
transportation conceded some of his points, he felt obligated to back it." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers agreed that, while he is now at odds with such old allies as Burkett, 
"there's no reason to end our friendship over this." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said he was swayed to support the plan by the inclusion of a stipulation 
that would make transportation money to cities partly dependent on their 
adoption of growth-management plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good plan," Rogers said. "Slow-growth advocates are in an absolutely 
no-lose situation. We got what we wanted beyond our wildest dreams."

BLACK IN DARK MOOD AFTER STRONG OUTING; 
</P>
<P>
CLEVELAND STARTER FRUSTRATED AFTER LOSING ON UNEARNED RUN, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bud Black could only look at the statistics and shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
Three hits. 
</P>
<P>
One run, unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Four strikeouts and no walks. 
</P>
<P>
And a 1-0 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Black could find only one word to describe his fifth complete game of the 
season for the Cleveland Indians Sunday in front of 32,640 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Frustrating," he said. "I pitched a hell of a game. But things like this 
happen. Sometimes you'll pitch good and win. Sometimes you'll pitch good and 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's loss lowered Black's record to 9-10 as well as his earned-run 
average to 3.98. He gave up two singles in the fourth and a triple to Bobby 
Rose in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Black's performance was reminiscent of two games he pitched against the Angels 
this season. On June 5, he scattered six hits in a 7-3 complete-game victory. 
In a 2-1 10-inning loss on June 27, he gave up only one run in 7 1/3 innings 
and wasn't involved in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those things where I always seem to pitch well against the 
Angels," said Black, a left-hander who helped San Diego State to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. Mideast Regional finals in 1979. "I like pitching 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said he can't remember Black pitching a bad game 
against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"What's he got, a 9-10 record and a four-something ERA?" Rader said. "Someone 
is beating him up, but it's not us." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Manager Doc Edwards said Black "pitched outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched about seven or eight games in a row like that this season," Edwards 
said. "He was very crisp. He was firm in his motion and stayed in command of 
his pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Black had been struggling lately. He was 2-2 with an 8.14 ERA in his five 
previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be as consistent as I can be," Black said. "Hopefully, I can get some 
runs when I pitch well." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland managed only four hits, all singles, off Angel starter Kirk McCaskill 
(13-7). 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating from a team standpoint," Black said. "We always seem to fall 
short." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' only run came in the seventh when Cleveland third baseman Brook 
Jacoby committed a two-base error. He allowed Kent Anderson's grounder to skip 
through his legs and trickle down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipated the ball coming up and it stayed down," Jacoby said. "I should 
have knocked the ball down in that situation. If anything, he would have been 
on first instead of second." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray's bunt moved Anderson to third before Wally Joyner lifted a fly ball 
to medium center field. Anderson beat center fielder Joe Carter's throw to the 
plate by a step. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't blame the loss on (Jacoby's) play," Edwards said. "He doesn't miss 
too many like that. He's one of the best in the league when it comes to that 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Indians' defense bailed Black out of a jam. 
</P>
<P>
Black had a no-hitter going until the fourth inning when Devon White led off 
with a single to left field and moved to third on a base hit by Anderson. After 
Ray popped to second, Joyner drove a fly ball to right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
As right fielder Joey Belle made the catch, White took off for home and 
Anderson tried for second but tripped about 15 feet from the base. Anderson 
recovered, but Belle's throw beat him to the bag to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Black said the double play gave the Indians a lift, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped a little bit but it was still fairly early," he said. "I assumed it 
would be a 1-0 game, one way or the other."

FOOTNOTES: READY TO GIVE UP THE GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haunted by an image that appeared in newspaper ads throughout the country, the 
owner of the copyright to Casper the Friendly Ghost filed a suit in 1984 
claiming that the logo in advertisements for Columbia Pictures' "Ghostbusters" 
infringed on its rights to a Casper character called "Fatso." A U.S. district 
court judge in 1986 threw out the $50-million suit -- filed by New York-based 
Harvey Publications -- ruling that there are "limited ways" to draw a cartoon 
ghost. 
</P>
<P>
However, Columbia recently settled the suit over the logo -- a cartoon ghost 
behind the circle and slash that signifies a prohibition -- said Alan Harvey, 
chief editor of Harvey Publications. Harvey said the company, acquired by the 
Los Angeles-based HMH Communications on Aug. 2, agreed not to disclose the 
value of the settlement. Columbia executives declined to comment on claims that 
the spirited dispute was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zeroing In on Competency 
</P>
<P>
Old-fashioned executives may believe that all it takes to succeed in business 
is drive, ambition and political savvy. Well, the Hay Group's management 
consulting unit thinks that it has a better way to zero in on qualities that 
make a successful employee. 
</P>
<P>
The company says it has devised a research method to identify "competencies" -- 
a person's skills, attitudes, style or character -- that lead to outstanding 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things that never show up in a job description . . . so traditional 
modes of hiring may bypass these qualitative dimensions," said Thomas Rollins, 
director of human resources, planning and development with Hay in Los Angeles. 
"The easy stuff -- the bachelor's plus five (years of experience) -- may be 
totally irrelevant to job performance." 
</P>
<P>
For a fee ranging from $20,000 to $80,000, Hay will study a company's 
employees, identify qualities that make for success in that firm and devise 
software to help assess job candidates, Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, about 20 qualities pop up more often than others in Hay 
research, Rollins said. They include initiative, a need for achievement and 
organizational awareness -- that is, drive, ambition and political savvy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twice-in-a-Trillion Group 
</P>
<P>
It seems that lottery lightning can strike twice in the same place. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, two sets of Sacramento employees at Weinstock's, a 
department store owned by Los Angeles' Carter Hawley Hale Stores, have pooled 
resources, bought lottery tickets and hit the jackpot. On Aug. 12, six workers 
in fine jewelry won $9.38 million in the Lotto drawing. After taxes, that's 
$62,561 a year for 20 years for each. A couple of weeks before, a group of nine 
women from the dresses department won $5.66 million. 
</P>
<P>
To top that off, both groups bought their tickets from the same booth -- owned 
by Jack Ford, son of former President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Bee, calling the whole thing "strange, bizarre (and) spooky," 
quoted a California Lottery Commission official as saying that the odds against 
this were a trillion to 1.

HUGHES AIRCRAFT IS SHIFTING SOME LEGAL WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft is sharply reducing its reliance on the Los Angeles law 
partnership of Latham &amp; Watkins, its dominant law firm dating back to the 
days when Howard Hughes was the owner. 
</P>
<P>
The change comes after a major legal blunder last year -- for which 
responsibility is undetermined -- that may cost Hughes $270 million. Officials 
at Latham &amp; Watkins insist that the loss of Hughes' business is not related 
to that case and reflects a broader effort by Hughes to diversify its legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has replaced Latham &amp; Watkins with the Chicago law firm Kirkland 
&amp; Ellis for portions of the aerospace firm's general law and patent law 
matters, according to John T. Kuelbs, Hughes' associate general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirkland &amp; Ellis is handling outside legal work, in addition to Latham 
&amp; Watkins," Kuelbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland &amp; Ellis does a substantial amount of legal work for General 
Motors, which bought Hughes in 1985. Elmer W. Johnson, former GM general 
counsel, is a partner at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Department in Turmoil 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' legal department apparently remains in some turmoil, a result of the 
legal blunder and more broadly of the recent effort by General Motors to assert 
greater control at Hughes. In the past two years, a difficult power struggle at 
Hughes has forced the resignation of its chairman and vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, The Times reported that a legal blunder in a huge 
patent-infringement case by Hughes against the U.S. government resulted in a 
federal judge throwing out $270 million in alleged damages. 
</P>
<P>
The patent-infringement case, known as the Williams patent case, involves a 
complex device that controls the orbit of a spinning satellite. Hughes alleged 
that the government stole the patent and used it on 108 government-built 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake occurred when Hughes settled a related patent case against Ford 
Motor Co. and inadvertently released the government from liability on 13 of its 
satellites. Hughes valued the claims on those 13 satellites at $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
Latham &amp; Watkins represented Hughes in the Ford settlement, but the law 
firm's managing partner, John F. Walker, insists that it did not make any error 
and that the loss of Hughes business is totally unrelated to that settlement. 
He said many major corporations are diversifying their legal representation, 
that the Hughes changes are part of that national trend. He added that Latham 
&amp; Watkins remains Hughes' "dominant" law firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different With GM 
</P>
<P>
As part of the fallout from the legal mistake, one of Hughes' top in-house 
patent attorneys was recently dismissed, causing some bitter feelings within 
Hughes. Moreover, when another in-house attorney at Hughes flunked the 
California Bar examination recently, the issue became a matter of hallway 
gossip and was leaked to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of axes to grind," one attorney said in an interview last 
week. "You are talking about big bucks when one law firm has it all, and now it 
is being competed. Times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said in a telephone interview that his firm is still winning new Hughes 
business, but that "it is a different situation today with GM." 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is that GM people have come in and (Richard) Alden is gone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alden was for many years general counsel of Hughes at the same time that he was 
a senior partner at Latham &amp; Watkins. When Hughes was acquired by GM, Alden 
retired from Latham &amp; Watkins and became vice chairman and general counsel 
at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was a boon to Latham &amp; Watkins, but it prompted many 
insiders at Hughes to raise an eyebrow at the close relationship. Over the 
years, Latham &amp; Watkins won "half or more" of Hughes' outside legal work, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' new general counsel, John Higgins, was installed by General Motors when 
Alden abruptly retired in 1987. He was not available for comment but reportedly 
has wanted to diversify Hughes' legal work away from Latham &amp; Watkins. Now 
legal work is being awarded after "duty contests," a form of competition among 
rival firms. That effort has resulted in more than casual backbiting. 
</P>
<P>
The legal turmoil is important because Hughes is entering the final stages of 
its massive Williams patent case, in which it has been seeking $3.16 billion 
from the U.S. government, the largest patent case in history. 
</P>
<P>
Oral arguments are scheduled to end next month and at least part of an opinion 
to be rendered by December, said U.S. Claims Court Judge James T. Turner, who 
is hearing the case.

DIVERSITY AND CHEAP LABOR IN MANUFACTURING ARE CUSHIONING THE SOUTHLAND AGAINST 
DEFENSE LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anywhere else, the news would have been devastating; it would have provoked 
anguish and outrage from politicians and sent severe shivers through the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The news: Hughes Aircraft said in June that it would eliminate 6,000 jobs, 
mostly in the Los Angeles area, by year-end. The reaction here: hardly more 
than a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the giant cutback has caused pain and dislocation among Hughes 
employees. But the general lack of outcry across Southern California to such a 
massive loss of jobs is stark evidence of how dramatically the manufacturing 
segment of the region's economy has changed during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
From their traditional dependence on airplanes and government contracts, the 
area's manufacturing industries have grown and diversified with dizzying speed. 
The fastest growing have been those that make so-called non-durable goods 
designed to last less than three years. Into this category fall the region's 
booming food processors, textile and apparel makers, printers and publishers, 
paper producers, and makers of rubber and plastic products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Force Is Key 
</P>
<P>
These businesses seem to be at the right place at the right time: cashing in on 
exports and a growing global fascination with California-related goods, 
particularly clothing and food. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the "durable" goods manufacturers -- most notably defense contractors 
and their hundreds of suppliers, faced with the end of the Reagan era's huge 
defense buildup -- are shifting, with varying degrees of success, to production 
of consumer-oriented electronics, new aircraft and equipment, and biotechnology 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, manufacturing here was defense-oriented," says Harris Smith, a 
partner at the accounting firm of Grant Thornton, which produces an annual 
study of regional manufacturing in the United States. "Now, it's much more 
diverse." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most profound change in the manufacturing climate here, 
according to some economic observers, has been the massive immigration of 
low-wage, relatively unskilled workers from Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"(Manufacturers) in Southern California that employ large numbers of 
immigrants, particularly Mexicans, have tended to grow faster than those that 
employ mostly native-born citizens," says David Hensley, director of the UCLA 
Business Forecasting Project. Those industries include apparel, textiles, 
furniture and food processing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The result of all this diversification and immigration has been the creation of 
a regional manufacturing base that seems well-cushioned to withstand the 
current decline in defense spending, many economists and business people say. 
</P>
<P>
Because the area is sometimes better known for its service industries, movies 
and tourism, the surprising strength of manufacturing has occasionally been 
overlooked. California ranks as the nation's biggest manufacturing state in 
terms of employment -- with 2.15 million workers -- and more than 40% of those 
jobs are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Call It a Pause' 
</P>
<P>
Although Southern California's manufacturing growth has spilled over -- 
sometimes dramatically -- to adjacent Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and 
Ventura counties, Los Angeles remains the region's "Mother Earth" with more 
than 900,000 manufacturing jobs, according to Joe Wahed, senior vice president 
and chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank. (By contrast, Orange County has about 
256,000 manufacturing jobs, Riverside and San Bernardino together have about 
82,000, and Ventura about 30,000.) 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as a slump (in manufacturing) due to the defense budget 
cuts," Wahed says. "I'd call it a pause or a temporary slowdown. Layoffs in 
defense are being compensated for by growth in commercial aircraft and 
electronics. And meantime, the other areas of manufacturing are mostly very 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence suggests that Wahed's "pause" began last year and is continuing. 
According to state employment figures, the number of durable goods 
manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles County was down by 4,000 in March this year, 
compared to March, 1988. But in that same one-year period, the number of 
non-durable manufacturing jobs rose by 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
And that increase follows a trend that saw the number of jobs in non-durable 
manufacturing jump to an estimated 317,600 last year from just over 284,000 in 
1985, while the number of those making durable goods fell to an estimated 
593,000 from more than 602,000, according to the California Employment 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't quite so sure that the cushion against defense layoffs provided 
by the growing manufacturers will be enough. UCLA's forecasters, for instance, 
expect regional manufacturing jobs to show at least a slight decline overall 
for the next two years, followed by "quite modest" growth in the 1990s, 
according to Hensley. 
</P>
<P>
And Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, sees 
"no exuberance" but also no slump for the region as defense spending drops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Abundance of Cheap Labor' 
</P>
<P>
Even if 1989 proves to be a relatively slow-growth year for manufacturing, 
however, many economic observers believe that the region is poised for a 
significant rise in the 1990s because of powerful economic forces at work, the 
strongest being the immigration of low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
A flood of people from Mexico and Central America has created much of the 
growth for industries such as furniture, apparel, food processing and textiles, 
UCLA's Hensley says. And despite strong new laws intended to prevent employers 
from hiring illegal immigrants, there is little evidence of a slowdown in 
immigration, he says. "There is an abundance of cheap labor, so industry comes 
here to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Some are worried, however, that the manufacturing jobs that have been created 
here in the 1980s as a result of immigration have largely been lower-paying 
positions with few benefits. Hourly wage statistics support that concern. 
</P>
<P>
While the average manufacturing wage in California was $10.95 an hour during 
the fourth quarter of 1988, the average wage in the apparel business was $6.40. 
The average furniture maker was paid $8.33 an hour, while the typical aircraft 
worker got $13.76. A typical textile worker got $7.04 an hour; an oil refinery 
worker was paid $16.28. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher-paid manufacturing jobs are flat or declining, the lesser-paid 
positions are increasing," says one corporate economist who asked not to be 
identified. "The result is to aggravate the worsening split between rich and 
poor in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Another statistic shows even more dramatically how immigration has affected the 
local economy: Nearly 75% of all new jobs -- both service and manufacturing -- 
created in Los Angeles County during the past seven or eight years have been 
filled by people with Hispanic surnames, according to Wells Fargo's Wahed. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration has also created a boom for the region's "underground" economy, 
where day laborers are paid in cash and no records are kept. All the 
government-maintained economic statistics are suspect, Kyser says. "Both the 
population and the manufacturing base (of Southern California) are 
under-counted because of the underground economy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And that makes it impossible to forecast the future with precision. No 
significant effort to estimate the size of the local underground economy has 
been made since the 1970s, when a survey by the Urban Institute figured that 
more than 50,000 manufacturing jobs were underground. 
</P>
<P>
Unless immigration slows to a trickle or a severe recession occurs, however, 
most observers don't expect the current trends to change. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the growth of non-durable manufacturing has been a gradual shift of 
jobs within the five-county greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing manufacturing counties, in terms of percentage gains, have 
been Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside. Most of the growth in those areas 
has been in durable goods manufacturing, while Los Angeles County has shown 
growth only in non-durable goods.

<P>
'Voting With Their Feet' 
</P>
<P>
There is some "out-migration" from Los Angeles to adjacent counties, according 
to Wahed, but for the most part the growth outside Los Angeles County has been 
a net addition to the economy, not a transfer of jobs within the region. 
</P>
<P>
"People are still voting with their feet and their plants that Southern 
California is a relatively competitive place to manufacture," says Stephen 
Levy, economist and director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the 
California Economy, a for-profit research organization in Palo Alto. "You can't 
deny that some plants are leaving (or moving within the area), but the net vote 
is a plus. It's simply not true that the Southern California economic climate 
is uncompetitive." 
</P>
<P>
Kyser of the Chamber of Commerce believes that, over time, Los Angeles County 
may become less the center of manufacturing in the region, but that may not be 
a bad thing. "There may be other, more profitable uses for the land," he says. 
"The (plants and equipment) for manufacturing are getting old, and some 
companies may be driven out by commercial development." 
</P>
<P>
But so far, he says, most of those manufacturers who have left Los Angeles 
County have relocated within the region, meaning no overall loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
That phenomenon, some say, suggests that manufacturers' complaints about 
regulation, high costs and restrictions that hinder their businesses may be 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like your neighbor complaining that he's broke and then buying a new 
Cadillac," Wahed says. "Despite all the impediments, (Southern California) has 
a remarkable record of growth -- far superior to most other parts of the 
country. There may come a time when congestion and high costs will be so 
debilitating that business will leave, but right now it's not happening fast 
enough or deeply enough to hurt."

BANKS IN L.A. USED -- UNWITTINGLY -- IN PENNY STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three banks in Los Angeles were used as part of an international network that 
laundered millions of dollars in illegal proceeds from penny stock schemes, 
according to recently unsealed federal court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Branches of Security Pacific National Bank, First Interstate Bank and Union 
Bank of Switzerland here were identified in the documents as playing unwitting 
roles in the sophisticated laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was detailed in documents filed in connection with a guilty plea 
entered in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas by Arnold L. Kimmes, a former 
Rancho Palos Verdes and Palm Springs resident, who has had a long career as a 
stock swindler. 
</P>
<P>
Since escaping French authorities aboard a yacht last year, Kimmes has been 
cooperating with the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in an investigation of penny stock fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being conducted by a grand jury in Las Vegas, where 
Kimmes' previously secret plea was unsealed earlier this month. But attorneys 
familiar with the inquiry say it has taken on a worldwide scope. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are low-priced, often risky securities that are traded outside the 
market system. While some cost as little as a penny a share, prices sometimes 
go much higher. Penny stock fraud has soared in recent years, and federal 
officials are trying to stop abuses. 
</P>
<P>
A key element in the fraud has been the use of high-pressure telephone sales 
tactics by "boiler rooms" peddling the stocks to small, unsophisticated 
investors. Last week, in an effort to combat that problem, the SEC adopted a 
rule requiring penny stock brokers to obtain a new customer's written approval 
before completing a sale. 
</P>
<P>
But SEC and IRS investigators are also waging a battle against sophisticated 
swindlers who set up phony companies to issue the stocks sold to unsuspecting 
investors worldwide through cooperating brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
In his plea agreement, Kimmes provided the government with a blueprint for how 
such shell companies are created and their stock sold to the public. He also 
described a second, critical step -- how to launder the proceeds from the sales 
so that the IRS does not get its hands on the money. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Kimmes and associates would create "shell" 
companies with basically no assets or operations. They registered the companies 
with the SEC and sold the shares to so-called nominees -- people who would be 
identified as the owners of the stock in exchange for small amounts of money. 
But Kimmes actually retained control. 
</P>
<P>
The stocks were held in nominee accounts at cooperating brokerages, where 
employees referred to them as "Charlie" accounts, using Kimmes' nickname. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stocks in a Box' 
</P>
<P>
The government said the elaborate process created the appearance of a viable 
public company with widespread shareholders, when actually Kimmes controlled 
all the shares of the shell. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, known as "stocks in a box" in the trade, were then sold by 
Kimmes to boiler room operators, who were able to sell the stocks to the 
public, according to the plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the arrangement provided the boiler room operators with 
control of all the stock and allowed them to set the price for the stocks far 
above what they had paid. 
</P>
<P>
Two firms created in that manner were identified in the documents as Onnix 
Financial Group and Executive Capital. Both were sold in 1987 to Meyer Blinder, 
a multimillionaire who controls Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., the nation's 
largest penny stock brokerage, according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Computer printouts seized last November during an IRS search of Blinder 
Robinson's headquarters in a Denver suburb show that the brokerage paid $2.6 
million for all 125 million shares of Onnix to two brokerages controlled by 
Kimmes, according to the plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The printouts indicated that Blinder Robinson subsequently sold the stock to 
investors for roughly twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the printouts showed that Blinder Robinson paid $4 million for all 
330 million shares of Executive Capital and later sold the stock to investors 
for about double that amount, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan C. Jacobson, a lawyer for Blinder Robinson, said his client was unaware of 
the way that Onnix and Executive Capital were created. He said it was 
"ludicrous" to infer that the brokerage or Blinder himself had done anything 
wrong in marketing the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimmes never once says in these papers that Meyer Blinder knew that there were 
nominees and that these were bogus companies," Jacobson said. "There is a 
reason for it and that is because obviously Kimmes never told him." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Meyer Blinder nor his firm has been charged with wrongdoing. But the 
government's documents claim that Kimmes and Blinder struck an illegal deal in 
1985 in which Kimmes would provide sham firms for Blinder to market and that 
Onnix and Executive Capital were related to that deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shipped to Dutch National 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles banks became involved when Kimmes wanted to conceal the money 
paid to him by Blinder Robinson for the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plea agreement, the checks for the stocks were usually sent to 
two offices in Palm Springs run by Kimmes. They were then shipped by overnight 
courier service to Robert Doorn, a Dutch national living in Switzerland, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
The documents said Doorn deposited the money into accounts that he controlled 
for Kimmes at Swiss banks. When Kimmes wanted money, he would have Doorn wire 
funds from the Swiss banks to U.S. accounts with instructions to issue cash to 
a European citizen to be identified by his passport. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government, a Doorn employee was dispatched from Switzerland 
to withdraw the cash and turn it over to Kimmes. For his trouble, Doorn 
received a 10% fee, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, according to a lawyer familiar with the investigation, the 
money was withdrawn by a Swiss national who identified himself to some bankers 
as a movie producer and to others as a real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
The amounts were considerable, according to the plea. On Oct. 15, 1987, Doorn 
wired $240,000 to the Union Bank of Switzerland here; on Dec. 3, 1987, he sent 
$198,000 to First Interstate, and on Feb. 22, 1988, another $240,000 was sent 
electronically to Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
While the 10% fee was expensive for Kimmes, it was much cheaper than paying 
taxes on the money. 
</P>
<P>
Any time someone deposits or withdraws $10,000 or more in cash at a U.S. 
financial institution, the institution is required to report the transaction 
and the person involved to the IRS. The law is designed to prohibit tax evasion 
and to help the government trace illegal proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Kimmes scheme was one way of evading the requirement by having the money 
withdrawn by a European national, who was outside IRS jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
While the Los Angeles banks say they followed IRS rules in reporting the 
withdrawals, an executive at one institution acknowledged that the scheme 
demonstrated how laws meant to track illegal earnings can be easily 
circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials believe that Los Angeles has emerged as a major center for 
money laundering. Recent indictments charged that $1.2 billion in drug money 
was laundered through the city for Colombian cocaine dealers. The drug dealers 
shipped the cash to jewelry stores here from around the country in armored 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry stores frequently deal in large amounts of cash, and banks can exempt 
some types of businesses from some of the IRS cash-reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Prison Sentence 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer familiar with the Kimmes case, who requested anonymity, said Kimmes 
laundered about $50 million in this manner through about a dozen U.S. banks. 
The only banks identified in the plea agreement were the three in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his deal with the government, Kimmes faces up to 20 years in prison. 
European governments have frozen several million dollars of his in bank 
accounts there, and arrest warrants for him have been issued in Switzerland and 
France. 
</P>
<P>
If the gendarmes come after him another time, he won't be able to escape on his 
yacht again. As part of his plea bargain, Kimmes forfeited the $1.1-million 
craft, called Bigfoot, and a smaller vessel.

William Hunt Files Plan: William Herbert Hunt, one of two former billionaire 
sons of wildcat oilman H. L. Hunt who is under protection from creditors, has 
filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court that would pay less than half 
of the $300 million in back taxes that the government claims he owes. The 
Internal Revenue Service, Hunt's largest creditor, previously has said it would 
settle for about $150 million, but Hunt's most recent plan would pay the IRS 
$120 million -- half from the proceeds of a liquidating trust and half from 
earnings after he emerges from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a Peruvian mining company 
filed a plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas saying it would settle 
for $80 million of the $132 million it lost on Hunt's failed silver 
speculation.

Valley Federal to Sell 5 Branches: The struggling Van Nuys-based thrift agreed 
to sell five branch offices in the San Joaquin Valley to Imperial Savings of 
San Diego for an undisclosed price. Valley Federal, which would have 40 
branches remaining, said it expects to post a "modest" fourth-quarter gain on 
the sale. The company, which lost $3 million last year, said the sale would 
also cut its operating costs by about $2 million a year.

FED TO RULE ON DEALERS OF U.S. BONDS IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the governors of the Federal Reserve meet in Washington today, Japan's 
most powerful financial institutions will be paying close attention. The Fed 
will rule whether to allow seven Japanese securities firms to maintain their 
status as primary dealers of U.S. government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
That status is threatened by the Primary Dealers Act, a little-noticed 
provision in last year's Omnibus Trade Bill that requires the Fed to deny a 
primary dealership to any firm whose home country does not give U.S. companies 
a fair opportunity to compete in its government securities market. The law 
takes effect Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Primary dealers are an elite group of companies authorized to deal directly 
with the Fed when it buys and sells U.S. government bonds. Aside from prestige, 
primary dealers gain new business opportunities, since many large investors in 
government securities will only conduct business with primary dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removal Doubtful 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 50 firms have primary dealer status, including four Japanese 
securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, Yamaichi), and subsidiaries of three 
Japanese banks (Industrial Bank of Japan, Sanwa, and Long-Term Credit Bank). 
</P>
<P>
Most industry experts believe that the Fed will not remove the dealerships from 
the Japanese, largely because recent reforms have opened new doors for foreign 
financial companies in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely the Fed will rescind our primary dealership," says Scott Pardee, 
chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc., a subsidiary of one of 
Japan's Big Four securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. A ruling against the Japanese firms could disrupt the flow 
of Japanese funds to the United States, making it more difficult to finance the 
federal budget deficit. U.S.-Japan collaboration on other financial issues, 
including third-world debt, could be hampered. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms center on the method of distributing Japanese government bonds. 
Shortly after the Primary Dealers Act passed last August (with the strong 
backing of U.S. financial firms), Japan's Ministry of Finance sought to head 
off a confrontation by announcing that 40% of all new 10-year bond issues would 
be sold through a competitive auction system that took effect last April. The 
remaining 60%, following the old system, is allocated in fixed shares to each 
of the more than 800 firms that belong to an underwriting syndicate. The share 
allotted to foreign firms has risen from 2.5% to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Syndicate Structure 
</P>
<P>
Four foreign firms are now members of the syndicate's executive committee, 
which negotiates the terms for new bond issues with the government. Salomon 
Brothers Inc. is a permanent member, while nine other foreign firms divide up 
the remaining three positions on a rotation basis. 
</P>
<P>
Access of this kind was long sought by U.S. companies, since Japan's government 
securities market is the second biggest in the world, after that of the United 
States. By 1984, 15 foreign firms had joined the syndicate and the number is 
now more than 60. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1980s, only a few foreign firms were active in the syndicate because 
Japanese government securities were unattractive investments. The government 
deliberately set yields below market rates to keep a lid on financing costs and 
domestic interest rates. Japanese financial firms were forced to accept their 
share of each new bond issue. But yields have gradually improved, and foreign 
firms have tried to boost their participation. 
</P>
<P>
The new access has been welcomed by U.S. firms as a big step toward competitive 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities Industry Association, a trade group, recommended to the Fed in 
an early May memo that it "refrain from suspending or delaying the primary 
dealer status of any foreign firm." 
</P>
<P>
Improved access notwithstanding, many industry executives insist that their 
firms still face competitive disadvantages in the Japanese government 
securities market. The syndicate system continues to be controversial, since 
large city banks receive the bulk of the 60% of new bond issues not subject to 
competitive auction. 
</P>
<P>
Another complaint is that structural features of the Japanese market affect 
foreign firms disproportionately. In particular, the lack of a wide range of 
secondary market trading activities in Japan deprives U.S. firms of their 
competitive advantage in innovative trades like futures and options, and makes 
it more difficult to finance costly bond market activities. 
</P>
<P>
If the Fed decides to keep Japanese firms as primary dealers, but progress is 
not made toward resolving these issues, then pressure to withdraw the primary 
dealerships could easily rise again.

KDOC-TV Channel 56 has added two staff reporters to its "NewsWatch" broadcast, 
the only regularly scheduled television news program originating in Orange 
County, according to station spokesperson Tricia Krause. The general assignment 
reporters, Christopher Heinbaugh and Beth Bingham, bring the on-camera news 
team to 5, including reporter Jerilyn Donovan and anchors Michelle Merker and 
Pat Matthews. Heinbaugh, a Cal State Northridge graduation, was a news writer 
at KNX radio before joining "NewsWatch," which airs weeknights at 8:30 p.m. 
Bingham, a graduate of UC San Diego, worked for an NBC television affiliate in 
Macon, Ga., before returning to Southern California. She will also host the 
station's weekly public affairs program, "Southland Today." Krause said that, 
with the addition of the two reporters, "NewsWatch" averages four Orange County 
stories per night.

7 MUSICIANS OFFERED POSTS WITH PACIFIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony has tentatively filled seven of its 14 open positions at 
an audition call that drew about 200 applicants in the last two weeks to the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians have been offered contracts but have not yet signed them, 
according to orchestra officials. The seven are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Violinists Tamara Chang, 23, of North Hollywood, Ingrid Kuo, 23, of New 
York City and Rachel Robinson, 21, Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Violists Andrew Pickin, 25, of Sherman Oaks and John Scanlon, 26, of Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 -- String bass Bruce Moyer, 37, of Pacifica in San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trombonist Michael Hoffman, 29, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Their experience ranges from playing as substitutes to holding positions in 
regional orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Pending signing their contracts, the seven will join the orchestra for the 
Sept. 2 concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The seven were selected by Pacific's music adviser, Kazimierz Kord, and several 
committees made up of principal players of the orchestra. The musicians 
performed behind a blind screen to ensure anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Kord and the committees decided not to award contracts to fill the positions of 
assistant concertmaster, three additional first violinists, one violist and two 
percussionists. Auditions for these positions will be held next season. CHRIS

SUCCESS CAN'T SPOIL SCAGGS ; 
</P>
<P>
BEING BACK ON TOP IS FINE, BUT COUNTRY STAR REFUSES TO LET THE CHARTS DICTATE 
HIS CAREER 
</P>

<P>
With his "Lovin' Only Me" a recent No. 1 country hit, and a current album 
bristling with deserving follow-ups, Ricky Skaggs has a career that clearly is 
back in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
The bluegrass-infused musician had practically been the first "new 
traditionalist," racking up early '80s hits and awards despite the 
Urban-Cowboyed crossover country that then held sway. In the last couple of 
years, though, it appeared as if the other tradition-minded artists for whom 
Skaggs had opened the door were beating him to the table. While Randy Travis 
and others commanded the charts, Skaggs rarely touched the Top 30 after 1986, a 
stark contrast to his string of 16 Top 10 records between 1982 and 1986, 
including 10 No. 1 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs and his eight-piece band will play the Crazy Horse Steak House tonight. 
Reached last week in the Pacific Northwest between county fair dates -- "We're 
calling this the Corndog Tour across America," Skaggs quipped -- the 
Kentucky-born singer/multi-instrumentalist seemed no more elated by his recent 
hit than he had felt stymied by his slump period. Skaggs says he's measuring 
his success by a different scale. 
</P>
<P>
"A career can really eat your lunch, if you start to worry about where you are 
in the charts, and whether you're going to work next month," he said. "That can 
pull your mind away from everything positive you're trying to do out on the 
road, so I just stopped worrying about anything like that and started really 
trying to focus my life and my attention on the whole reason I'm out here, and 
try to do something good for somebody while I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs might already sound like a man on a mission, but he was just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I'm out here for a reason, to hopefully spread light into a dark 
world, so to speak. There's a lot of darkness out there with everything that's 
so wrong with the world. There's a lot of things that are right about it, too, 
and we try to spread those good positive messages. Here I'm speaking from a 
Christian background, and I try not to go out as a preacher, but I really try 
to mean something to somebody's life somehow. When we leave I hope that it's 
made an impact on somebody, and they go home feeling refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's responsibilities out there when little 3- and 5-year-old kids look up 
at me, and in their eyes I see they're looking for a role model or hero kind of 
figure. I know when I was a kid I needed heroes: the Duke, Mickey Mantle, Roger 
Maris. I'd go see Bill Monroe, the Stanley Brothers, Roy Acuff and (Lester) 
Flatt &amp; (Earl) Scruggs and my eyes would get so big. They made impressions 
on me, so believe me I take it very seriously, every word that I speak to those 
kids looking at me out there." 
</P>
<P>
In his 35 years, Skaggs has gained quite a reputation for taking things 
seriously. By the age of 5, he had applied himself to the mandolin sufficiently 
to perform on stage with bluegrass legend Bill Monroe. An equal verve for the 
guitar, fiddle and banjo saw him through stints with Ralph Stanley, the Country 
Gentlemen and Emmylou Harris' Hot Band. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting his own band, Skaggs obstinately faced down skeptics who thought his 
revved-up-roots approach to country would find no place in the early '80s 
synthetic country scene. Following Skaggs' success and the subsequent "new 
traditionalist" victories of Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam and others, now even 
the slickest holdovers are scampering to display their newfound roots. Skaggs, 
meanwhile, has kept refining his approach, sometimes driving co-workers to 
distraction with a perfectionism that has earned him the nickname "Picky Ricky" 
around Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
The strong negative feelings Skaggs holds about "country that isn't country" 
run so counter to his studied politeness as to render him nearly inarticulate 
on the subject. But he also sees less need to man the trenches against it now. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think country music is in the best shape that it's ever been in. 
There is a standard sound now that is 'country' again, like it was in the late 
'50s and early '60s. I think with the help of a lot of the country artists that 
have come after us, everybody's done their part to secure that, to latch that 
lid down. There's room for new sounds and new musicians to come in, but I think 
there will always be a standard now of excellence, quality and integrity, 
because I don't think we younger ones will settle for anything less." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the move back to a well-grounded country music has created a more 
diverse and enduring audience than the "Urban Cowboy" crossover era did. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got doctors, lawyers, rocket scientists and brain surgeons, and then 
we've got the Jethro BoDeans and Ma and Pa Kettle, and the little kids. Last 
night we had some little 14- and 16-year-old girls -- the whole front row was 
lined with them -- and they were screaming like it was a rock concert. And they 
knew the words to the songs." 
</P>
<P>
When searching for material to record -- Skaggs confesses that he is "not a 
very blessed songwriter" -- he said he "looks for things that have a real 
appeal to younger people. I don't try to discard the older folks, but I just 
have a heart for younger people out there, because I feel they are the ones 
that are hurting so bad right now. 
</P>
<P>
"This one runaway girl had been gone for two or three months and heard ('Thanks 
Again'), and bought the record and sent it home to her parents, and that was 
the first contact she'd had with them. 
</P>
<P>
"It got them talking, and as a result they all got back together. They were 
sitting in the front row at one of my shows at Wolf Trap near Washington, D.C., 
and while I was singing that song they were all cuddled up and cryin' and 
snottin'. It was wonderful to look out there and see how one little thing you'd 
done through a song, how it had touched somebody. That's one of those little 
nuggets that makes it worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
As valuable as he finds such moments, Skaggs said he's looking to move his 
career into a slower gear. 
</P>
<P>
"It really gets hard. My wife (Sharon White, of the singing group the Whites) 
and I both travel on the road and we both hate our lives the way they are. We 
hate being away from each other, we hate being away from our kids, and we both 
are really serious about doing something about it, trying to slow our schedules 
down. I'd like to cut my touring schedule 25 to 30% next year if I can. That 
would maybe cut it down to 100 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
Such a cutback could be damaging to his recently revived sales, but, he said, 
"It's worth it to me. I don't care. I mean, I love my fans, and (his label) CBS 
and radio and the promoters out there, but family comes first. I've always put 
my family second or third, and I really hate that. I've got four children now, 
two of which are 12 and 10 -- my 5-year-old is about ready to start 
kindergarten, and Sharon and I have a 3-month-old boy. Every time I come home 
he's grown two or three inches." 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs said it could be two years before he enters the studio again, but he is 
already collecting songs for a new album. Nothing is set yet, but Skaggs said 
he has several projects in the works, including some possible cable specials 
featuring him and his far-flung musical friends (not too many performers have 
shared stages with both Bill Monroe and Elvis Costello). Even at a slower pace, 
he said, "it definitely won't be Boresville around here."

VIDEO EXECUTIVE, WIFE SLAIN IN BEVERLY HILLS MANSION; 
</P>
<P>
BOTH SHOT REPEATEDLY, POLICE SAY 
</P>

A Los Angeles entertainment executive who once headed RCA/Ariola records and 
U.S. operations for the Hertz Corp. was found shot to death along with his wife 
in their Beverly Hills mansion, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Jose E. Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise (Kitty) Menendez, 44, were 
discovered shortly before midnight in their North Elm Drive home by one of 
their two sons, who called 911 at 11:47 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hysterical call," said Lt. Robert Curtis, spokesman for the 
Beverly Hills Police Department. When police arrived one minute later, they 
discovered the victims, dressed in street clothes, dead in a front family room 
of the Mediterranean-style mansion. Both had been shot repeatedly, officers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Video Firm 
</P>
<P>
Menendez was chairman of the board of LIVE Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a 
successful firm that buys video rights to feature films, including those made 
by Sylvester Stallone, and delivers video and music software to big retailers. 
</P>
<P>
The homicides, the first to occur in Beverly Hills this year, shocked residents 
of the tree-lined street, among the most upscale in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One elderly neighbor, who declined to be identified, said: "Things like this 
don't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said it was not immediately clear how the assailants gained entry to the 
Menendez home but noted that the house was not ransacked. Investigators were 
not aware of any threats against the couple, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people were brought to the Police Department for questioning but were 
released, Curtis said. They were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Popping' Sounds 
</P>
<P>
Tom Zlottou, who lives across a back alley from the Menendez house, said he was 
watching a televised James Bond movie on Sunday night when he heard "popping" 
sounds -- apparently gunshots -- coming from across the alley. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anything of the sound," he said, despite the fact that the 
sound of gunfire is such a rarity in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, a certified public accountant who was educated in New York City, 
spent 14 years with the RCA Corp., ultimately directing all U.S. operations for 
its Hertz Corp. car rental subsidiary. He also was chief operating officer for 
its RCA/Ariola division, according to a biography released today by LIVE 
Entertainment, the company that he has directed since leaving RCA in August, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE's vice president of operations, John Powell, who arrived early today at 
the mansion, said he is dumbfounded as to why anyone would kill the Menendezes. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole company is in shock," the shaken Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second-Quarter Profits 
</P>
<P>
Last week, LIVE Entertainment posted second-quarter net income of $1.5 million, 
almost triple the profit it made in the 1988 period, on revenue of $82.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said a strong performance by newly acquired Strawberry Records, an 
85-store retail chain based in New England, played a key role in what it called 
"record" results. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendezes, according to property records, moved in October, 1988, from a 
$950,000 house in Calabasas to the $4-million home in Beverly Hills where they 
died. They took out a $2-million loan on the house, records show.

SEPULVEDA TUNNEL CLOSURE TIES UP 405, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS EXPECTED

Closure of the Sepulveda Boulevard tunnel for construction work resulted in an 
early-morning traffic tie-up on the southbound San Diego Freeway today, but 
officials said the situation was not as bad as they had feared. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any big problems," said California Highway Patrol Officer Dave 
Grajeda. "I hope it stays this good." Grajeda said that although there was more 
traffic than usual on the freeway, there were no major accidents -- only 
slow-moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic-control officers on such alternate routes as Beverly Glen Boulevard and 
Coldwater Avenue said traffic on those thoroughfares was only slightly heavier 
than usual as a result of the tunnel closure. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical weekday, an estimated 28,000 cars pass through the Sepulveda 
tunnel, which is one of the main links between the Los Angeles Basin and the 
San Fernando Valley, officials said. Repeated repaving inside the tunnel has 
raised the level of the road so much that the tops of big-rig trucks often 
scrape its sloping roof. The tunnel, which runs beneath Mulholland Drive, will 
be shut down until Sept. 30 while workers lower the pavement level.

A series of four small rocket firings, the final such maneuver ever planned for 
Voyager 2, began around 4:09 a.m. as the probe streaked toward Neptune at

FEINSTEIN CAMPAIGN MANAGER QUITS, SAYS EX-MAYOR LACKS COMMITMENT

Dianne Feinstein's campaign manager abruptly resigned today, complaining that 
the former San Francisco mayor "has been unwilling to commit to a schedule, an 
organization and a budget capable of electing her governor." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein responded to Clinton Reilly's announcement with a sharply worded 
written statement: "I regret that he would announce his resignation to the 
media without first having told me." 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident we shall recruit others equally as capable of carrying out a 
winning campaign," Feinstein continued in her written statement. "This in no 
way deters my determination to continue my campaign for governor. In fact, it 
redoubles my commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's announcement praised Feinstein's "immense potential" but was unusually 
blunt, especially for someone with such a long and close political association 
as Reilly had with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly had managed Feinstein's successful 1983 campaign against a recall 
attempt and her successful 1984 reelection campaign for mayor as well as her 
unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for vice president in 1984.

The spiritual leader of pro-Iranian militants warned today that French 
intervention in Lebanon's war would be disastrous, but people in both sectors 
of divided Beirut gave a French naval buildup a guarded welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"To intervene with one Lebanese party against another will lead to disastrous 
results," said Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual mentor of the Shiite 
Muslim Hezbollah group. 
</P>
<P>
"France is trying to give moral support to a Lebanese party," Fadlallah told 
the Visnews television news agency, referring to Christian army chief Michel 
Aoun, who is battling Syrian troops and their Lebanese militia allies. 
</P>
<P>
A French aircraft carrier, a frigate and a hospital ship sailed Saturday for 
the Lebanese coast to join three French navy ships. France, the former colonial 
power in Lebanon, says it will give humanitarian aid and evacuate French 
citizens if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-Iranian group holding two American hostages threatened Sunday to harm 
them if the French stepped into the 14-year-old Lebanese war. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Christian enclave said the French decision to dispatch its 
fleet showed that the world had not forgotten them.

NO PLANS FOR U.S. TROOPS IN LATIN DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
SUNUNU SAYS BUSH WOULD BE WARY EVEN IF ASKED BY VARGAS

<P>
President Bush does not plan to send U.S. troops to Colombia to fight the 
cocaine industry, White House chief of staff John H. Sununu said today. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Bush would be wary of doing so even if the South American 
nation's president, Virgilio Barco Vargas, requested such help. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu was backing away from comments made Sunday by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
that the Administration should consider sending troops to Colombia if invited. 
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff said the Administration drug policy does not envision 
sending U.S. troops to any Latin American country to fight drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tradition in the Western Hemisphere, a reluctance for anyone to ask 
for troops and a reluctance of the President to commit troops," he told 
reporters after meeting with the vacationing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu also said Bush will submit a $7.5-billion to $8-billion anti-drug 
package to Congress next month that will include increased aid to Latin 
American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will present details of his drug strategy in a Sept. 5 speech to the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Specific Figure 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been various reports on the price tag of the plan, Sununu's 
reference to a cost of $7.5 billion to $8 billion marked the first time the 
Administration has publicly offered a figure. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money will be rechanneled from other programs, Sununu said. He said 
the main focus of the plan will be domestic, although it will contain funds to 
help Latin American countries fight drug traffic at the source. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu said Bush made most final decisions on the drug package today, sending a 
series of directives back to budget director Richard G. Darman on where to 
siphon funds from other programs. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of new threats to American hostages held by Islamic militants in 
Lebanon, Sununu said there has been no change in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to react to each new threat," he said. "The policy remains 
unchanged. The President underscored that the hostage-takers are responsible 
for the safety of all the hostages." 
</P>
<P>
A pro-Iranian group said Sunday that it would consider killing two American 
hostages if the French navy intervenes in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoidance of Attention 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it is our policy not to try to increase attention on the hostages," 
Sununu said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush spoke briefly with reporters on the golf course and said he had 
been briefed by Sununu on the latest threat to U.S. hostages and was leaving it 
to his staff chief "to explain our position." 
</P>
<P>
A pro-Iranian extremist group believed to be holding American hostages Joseph 
Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy issued death threats Sunday against the two 
men if French ships in the Mediterranean intervene in Lebanon's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by a Shiite Muslim group, which calls itself the Revolutionary 
Justice Organization, was accompanied by a photocopy of a photograph of Tracy 
the group released Aug. 1.

<P>
Turkey announced today it will close its border with Bulgaria to curb an influx 
of ethnic Turks and pressure Sofia to negotiate an agreement over their future. 
</P>
<P>
About 310,000 ethnic Turks, saying they faced a Bulgarian campaign of religious 
and cultural assimilation, have fled to Turkey in an unchecked flow since 
Turkey waived visa obligations for them in June. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ankara's first direct retaliation over Bulgaria's refusal to negotiate 
the future of the 1.5-million-member minority. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Premier and State Minister Ali Bozer said Turkey will close the frontier 
at 2 a.m. Tuesday. He insisted Ankara remains ready to accept all ethnic Turks 
once a comprehensive agreement is reached with Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has rejected Turkey's call for an accord to compensate refugees for 
property left behind and to protect the rights of ethnic Turks who want to 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to draw the line at some point . . . to bring some sense and order to 
the haphazard way Bulgaria heaps people on the border," a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said.

Australia may have to curb immigration and set a population ceiling of around

Ray, in a television interview, said one in seven Australians will be of Asian 
origin in 40 years. Australia's present population is around 17 million, with 
the bulk of migrants from Britain, Ireland and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of migrants settle in Sydney and Melbourne, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At some stage in the future, for environmental or other reasons, it may be in 
our self-interest then to limit migration," he said.

More than 120,000 immigrants are admitted to Australia every year.

DOW DROPS 40.97 AFTER CLOSING IN ON RECORD

Stock prices suffered a broad setback today in a sluggish late-summer session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 40.97 points to 2,647.00, for its 
biggest one-day loss since it dropped 46.47 points on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 371 up, 1,164 down and 423 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 136.80 million shares, against 145.81 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index tumbled 2.67 to 189.97. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates fell in early trading in the credit markets, then reversed 
course and headed higher as the day progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said many traders remained skeptical that rates would go lower in the 
immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve is generally believed to be holding off on any more moves 
to relax its credit policy until it can see more evidence that inflation has 
been successfully restrained. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow average began the day within striking distance of the closing high of 
2,722.42 it reached two years ago this week. Brokers noted, however, that it 
has stalled in that area for last the several sessions. 
</P>
<P>
When stocks showed no sign of making a new run at that peak today, sellers took 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in slow trading today largely on technical factors after 
Friday's choppy session. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Federal Reserve Board to allow Japanese primary dealers to 
remain in the U.S. bond market also boosted prices slightly, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 19/32 point, or about $5.90 for 
every $1,000 in face value by late morning. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction from price, was down to 8.09% from 8.15% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a carry-over of what went on in the market on Friday," said Maria F. 
Ramirez, managing director and money market economist for Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. "People are taking some profits, taking advantage of the strength 
in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said very light volume tends to exaggerate price movements.

Struggling computer maker Wang Laboratories Inc. said today it had successfully 
restructured its credit agreements with bank lenders, gained an additional $100 
million in borrowing power and would make the debt payments it suspended last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the agreement, the company said it now had a total $575 million 
in outstanding indebtedness. It also said its agreements with lender banks 
would enable it to raise $175 million in working capital, with additional 
assets pledged as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
Wang began renegotiating its lending agreements with banks after earlier this 
month announcing it had lost more than $300 million in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
An Wang, founder and chief executive officer of the company, said the company 
continues to explore sale of certain portions of the business, including 
domestic and international leasing subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Frederic Wang, Wang's eldest son, has stepped aside as president of the 
company.

<P>
Britain's BAT Industries today posted a 20% rise in pretax profits for the 
first half of the year, citing the strong results as a reason for shareholders 
to reject a $21-billion takeover offer from financier Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
BAT reported pretax profits of $1.27 billion in the first six months of 1989, 
up from $1.06 billion in the same period last year. Revenue climbed to $15.7 
billion from $12.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in the conglomerate, whose holdings include Brown and Williamson tobacco 
in the United States, Benson and Hedges tobacco in Britain and Los 
Angeles-based insurance firm Farmers Group Inc., rose 17 cents to $12.94 each 
on the news. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Goldsmith announced his bid, the largest ever made in Europe, for 
BAT through his Hoylake investment company. The offer valued BAT shares at 
$13.34 each.

VESTRON REPORTS $65-MILLION LOSS

<P>
Vestron Inc., which recently laid off about 140 employees after losing a 
$100-million line of credit, today reported a second quarter net loss of $65 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The film and video company blamed the loss on the writedown of motion picture 
assets resulting from the restructuring of Vestron's operations two months ago 
and a substantial decline in revenue for the period. 
</P>
<P>
The company said revenues for the six months were affected by a substantial 
decrease in videocassettes sales for titles that received less theatrical 
exposure, compared to those released in the same period last year, including 
"Dirty Dancing," "Hamburger Hill" and "The Running Man."

Swedish railway workers, demanding a $300-a-month pay hike, staged a wildcat 
strike today that shut down most train service and jammed highways with 
commuters trying to drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
Managers at Swedish Rail were attempting to keep as many commuter trains in 
service as possible, but only 10% of the country's trains were in operation, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters clogged highways in an attempt to get to work, and a spokesman for 
the national road service said cars were backed up for miles along the roads to 
most major cities. Airport officials said three times the regular number of 
people were trying to book tickets on domestic flights. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 3,300 train drivers were striking to press their demands for a 
$300 per month pay hike and force the Social Democratic government to withdraw 
plans to increase the pension age from 60 to 65.

USC, UCLA IN VULNERABLE SPOTS;

<P>
PAC-10 POWERS OF '80S LOSE STAR QUARTERBACKS TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC and UCLA have been the teams of the '80s in the Pacific-10 Conference. But 
as the decade draws to a close, the competition is gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
USC has split four Rose Bowl games this decade, while UCLA is 3-0. The only 
other Pac-10 teams to play in Pasadena during that time are Washington and 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, USC won its first 10 games before losing its regular-season finale 
to Notre Dame and falling to Michigan in the Rose Bowl. UCLA also finished 10-2 
and won an NCAA-record seventh straight bowl game, beating Arkansas 17-3 in the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But both Pac-10 powers could be vulnerable this season because their star 
quarterbacks have gone to the NFL. UCLA's Troy Aikman signed a rich contract 
with the Dallas Cowboys, and USC's Rodney Peete was drafted by the Detroit 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of the multi-talented Peete, USC Coach Larry Smith does not 
plan to change his offense much this season. With talented tailback Aaron 
Emanuel and fullback LeRoy Holt, the Trojans once again stress the running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to have our best running game since I came here," Smith said. 
"We have our top five rushers from last year back." 
</P>
<P>
The starting quarterback figures to be either Pat O'Hara, a fourth-year junior 
who completed five of seven passes last season, or redshirt freshman Todd 
Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara came out of spring practice as the first-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about our quarterback position," Smith said. "I'm really not that 
worried about it right now. My main concern is not the quarterbacks, but to 
make sure we get the whole team playing team football." 
</P>
<P>
With Aikman gone, Jimmy Bonds and Bret Johnson are battling for the starting 
quarterback job at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always needed two quarterbacks and have always used two quarterbacks," 
Bruins Coach Terry Donahue said. "I think both of them are good players and 
both are capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a redshirt freshman while Bonds is a third-year sophomore who 
completed four of seven passes for 42 yards in limited duty last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we'll do differently, particularly early, is try to be a better 
running team and not put as much pressure on the quarterback to do things that 
Troy did," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Tailbacks Brian Brown, Shawn Wills and Kevin Williams will run behind an 
experienced offensive line. Wills ran for 622 yards as a freshman last season, 
while Brown gained 410 yards. Williams, one of the most highly recruited prep 
players a year ago, wound up redshirting because of hamstring problems. 
</P>
<P>
Like UCLA and USC, Washington State must adjust to the loss of its star 
quarterback. Timm Rosenbach, who led the nation in passing and guided the 
Cougars to a 9-3 record last season, skipped his senior year to enter the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State also has a new coach, Mike Price from Weber State. Price 
replaces Dennis Erickson, who went to Miami after Jimmy Johnson left to become 
the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon could challenge if junior quarterback Bill Musgrave remains healthy. The 
Ducks started 6-1 last year, but Musgrave suffered a broken collarbone and they 
lost their last five. 
</P>
<P>
Washington finished 6-5 last season and missed a bowl game for the first time 
in 10 seasons. Senior quarterback Cary Conklin returns for Coach Don James, 
who's entering his 15th season coaching at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Other returning Pac-10 quarterbacks include Troy Taylor at California, Jason 
Palumbis at Stanford, Paul Justin at Arizona State and Ronald Veal at Arizona.

Newly acquired quarterback Jim McMahon will start San Diego's exhibition game 
Wednesday night at San Francisco, Chargers Coach Dan Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego acquired the eight-year veteran last Friday from the Chicago Bears 
for a conditional 1990 draft choice. McMahon took the first four snaps of the 
second half against his former teammates on Saturday in a game the Chargers won 
24-7 at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the Chargers relaxed before Sunday afternoon's practice, 
McMahon spent four hours with quarterback Coach Ted Tollner preparing for the 
San Francisco game.
