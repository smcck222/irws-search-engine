BUDGET CUTS IN STATE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has a new record-high budget, and the gasoline tax just went up by 5 
cents a gallon. Yet we still hear people blaming Proposition 13 for cuts in 
important programs. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, there have been no budget cuts. In 1978, when Proposition 13 
passed, the state budget was roughly $14 billion. The budget just approved by 
the state is slightly under $56 billion. The state budget has quadrupled in 12 
years! The population of California has not increased by that much, nor has 
inflation been so high. The recent news reports of cuts made by the governor in 
the new budget are misleading: They are cuts in proposed increases. 
</P>
<P>
Second, budget cuts would be a good thing! Every dollar taken in taxes from the 
person who earns it deprives that person of freedom to choose how to spend the 
fruits of his or her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition. 13 was an attempt to stop the politicians from robbing us without 
limit. It's a shame it wasn't stronger.

NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years I have been reading how our environmentalists have been prodding 
Brazil and other Third World countries to save the rain forests because of the 
damaging effect this destruction would have on global climate, to say nothing 
of air for breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we have a constant battle to preserve our national parks, as well as our 
coastlines (regarding oil) from exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't our country strong enough to afford these "luxuries?" What are we going 
to leave for our descendants? Bare bones and ravaged earth? 
</P>
<P>
And if we are ever in such desperate straits that we're forced to use them, 
they will still be there. If we use them up now, what then? 
</P>
<P>
If lumber companies want trees, why do they not plant them? If they had done 
this in the past, there would have been plenty available. And it is not too 
late to start now. (Apologies to any company which has been doing this.)

NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The timber base in our country is vanishing quickly on public and private 
lands. While the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been 
busy liquidating forests on federal lands, a recent study by the Oregon State 
University School of Forestry indicates that the private forest owners in that 
state will essentially cut their last mature tree in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
There simply is not enough resource left to satisfy the insatiable appetite for 
raw logs for Asian markets. In attempting to satisfy this demand, we have been 
decimating our national forests and exporting the mill jobs that go along with 
the unprocessed logs. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northwest, about 25% of the resource is exported as whole logs, 35% as 
raw materials and 40% is domestically processed. If exports are stopped the 
Northwest can stop cutting on all public lands without shrinking the domestic 
timber supply. The banning of exports is the one area of common ground between 
the timber industry and environmentalists. The overwhelming support in logging 
communities for the advisory referendum banning log exports reflects how 
closely related loggers' job security is connected with the banning of log 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
And those concerned with forest values such as watershed, climatic effects, 
wildlife habitat, fish spawning areas, scenic beauty and recreation would be 
pleased with the lowering of the cut. The time has come for us to put a halt to 
the plundering of our dwindling timber resource for the advantage of other 
nations. To save what is left of our native forests we must ban log exports 
now.

NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for John Balzar's excellent article ("Northwest Is at War With 
Itself," Aug. 6) on the conflict over Oregon's and Washington's forests. The 
article failed to mention, however, that the conflict extends also to Northern 
California, and that the citizens of California will have an opportunity to 
take a stand on this issue in November with Proposition 130. 
</P>
<P>
Driving through Northern California you can see great forests stretching 
seemingly forever, but much of this is illusion. A little back from the highway 
are large areas totally stripped of trees. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid too many of us take for granted that these great forests will always 
be with us. In fact, if present trends continue, they will actually disappear 
like so many other forests of the past such as the cedar forests of Lebanon and 
the forests of Greece and Northern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Today less than 5% of California's ancient forests remain. In some parts of the 
state trees are being cut three times faster than they grow. 
</P>
<P>
Forests can be a renewable resource, but only if we renew them -- only if the 
rate of cut doesn't exceed the rate of growth. It's called sustainable yield, 
and that is what Proposition 130 will establish. Proposition 130 may be our 
last chance to save a precious resource. I hope we take it.

Regarding your article, those of us who live and work in the Northwest would 
like to comment. It was silly for your reporter to compare the rain forests of 
the Amazon, which are being razed, to the forests of this country which are 
scientifically managed and replanted after they are harvested. 
</P>
<P>
Countries like Brazil don't preserve trees in wilderness areas like we do, nor 
do they have a sustained yield policy as we do in this country. The Forest 
Service is directed by the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 and the 
National Forest Management Act of 1976 to manage the federal timberlands for 
multiple use and sustained timber harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Private landowners in the United States plant more than 6 million trees daily, 
and federal and state governments plant another 900,000 trees daily. As a 
nation, we recognize that timber is a unique, renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
The ecosystem we want to preserve is an interrelationship of working people and 
the land that supports them. We have enough tree museums in the 32 million 
acres of wilderness already set aside in this country. And many Americans 
cannot enjoy these wilderness areas because no roads or motorized vehicles are 
allowed in them. The public benefits from Forest Service timber sale programs 
because we need the wood products our forests provide us for housing and many 
everyday needs.

SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF HUSSEIN'S OFFICERS IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH U.S.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CLANCY, Tom Clancy, author of Clear and Present Danger, is a novelist 
and military analyst. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Saddam Hussein attacked his small and defenseless neighbor, Kuwait, he 
made the world face up to a number of unpleasant realities. 
</P>
<P>
But Hussein may also have opened a door onto something both new and promising. 
The allies do have options, some of which can go beyond the conflict itself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can we reach a "modus vivendi" with Hussein? To do so presupposes a 
reasonable degree of confidence in the other fellow's world. It would be 
foolish indeed to trust Saddam Hussein. In this case the historical precedent 
is, "No peace with Bonaparte." Do we want to leave Hussein in place and wait 
for him to fabricate his first nuclear warhead? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sit tight, and wait for the trade embargo to work. But do we have the 
patience for this? We should, of course, but do we? The media's demand for 
instant stories and instant reaction creates an atmosphere in which doing 
nothing -- often the proper course of action -- looks like weakness, and since 
political leaders cannot allow themselves to be seen showing weakness (there 
are elections this year), they might be forced into action that common sense 
would ordinarily avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A power demonstration. One thing we keep forgetting is that war is above 
all an exercise in psychology. Armies are rarely broken physically. They break 
because they perceive themselves to be beaten. Creating doubt in the mind of an 
army commander has more effect than crushing one of his divisions. What if a 
flight of F-117A Stealth fighters trolled across Baghdad at a fraction over 
Mach-1, trailing sonic booms in their wake? If our technology works as well as 
the contractors and the Pentagon think, then we have the ability to negate much 
of the Soviet technology upon which Iraq depends. If we shake the confidence of 
Hussein's professional officers in their ability to deal with American power, 
we will have the psychological upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take the initiative and begin limited offensive operations. Eliminate the 
Iraqi air force, then identify vital economic and military targets, and begin 
eliminating them. Next, select an isolated Iraqi army unit, and destroy it in 
place. There is more to combat than tanks and guns. More important is 
communications. Most important of all is the quality and training of the 
individual soldier. Iraq has a literacy rate of 50% at best. How good can its 
soldiers be? And the American military is still flush from Reagan's buildup. 
The quality of our people is something that must be seen to be appreciated. If 
the government has the wisdom to employ them properly, they will win for us. 
Some of those kids will be killed and maimed. This is not an option to be 
undertaken lightly, but what we call civilization has been bought in blood, not 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Full-blown war. One hopes that this is not necessary, but if Hussein begins 
to mistreat his hostages, it is more than a possibility. The same is true if 
Iraq launches a large-scale chemical strike at American and other allied 
forces. Though definitive, this option will be very costly to all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate objective of any conflict is a peace whose characteristics are 
more favorable than those which preceded it. If there is any consistent failure 
in American history, it is the failure to plan for what comes after conflict. 
</P>
<P>
This conflict offers the most remarkable opportunities -- and dangers -- of 
recent history. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of Iraq as a regional military power will inevitably leave Iran 
as the biggest kid on the block. We need to think very hard about that. We have 
learned that the energy reserves upon which the world depends are in countries 
with populations so small that they cannot translate economic muscle into 
sufficient defense forces. At the same time, it would be a historically immoral 
act to hold these countries hostage to our economic needs. A permanent American 
land force in the region may ultimately prove to be necessary, but to demand or 
impose such a force would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Western perception of the Islamic world comes from terrorist acts, or grows 
from the Arab-Israeli conflict now two full generations old. What if the world 
judged the Christian faith by terrorist activities in Northern Ireland? And 
while America cannot allow Israel to suffer harm, there is more to the Middle 
East than Israel. By preserving some Arab regimes and restoring another, and 
perhaps also placing something akin to a just government in Iraq, we have an 
opportunity to exert the finest sort of influence and earn genuine goodwill in 
a region so often bereft of both. Islam is not a religion of barbarians. It has 
its own noble traditions of religious and racial tolerance. It has often been 
misused and blasphemed by its own adherents, but the same is true of 
Christianity. We share far more values than differences with the Muslim world. 
</P>
<P>
Realpolitik is a word crafted by cynics to justify the action of mediocrities. 
Such people do not solve problems, but maintain them. Principle is the only 
thing that matters in international affairs. Woodrow Wilson observed that small 
countries, treated as equals, make the most loyal of allies. We are dealing 
with people who have pride and tradition in addition to their economic assets. 
If we remember that, we may yet find in war the greatest opportunity for peace 
in living memory. The good influence of America might guarantee the peace of 
the region, including Israeli security, once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of a world-ending conflict is nearly gone. If we can next show 
in the Persian Gulf that petty wars will not be tolerated, the dream of all 
human history -- the elimination of war as an instrument of policy -- will 
become something more practical than a dream.

6-YEAR-OLD JESSICA STRUGGLES WITH ARTIFICIAL LIMBS TO BE 'NORMAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occasionally, when she's sitting home in the afternoons, Jessica Lynn Esquivel 
sees a commercial flash across the television screen. This particular 30-second 
spot leaves her frustrated, annoyed, confused, and, she said, a little bit 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
In it, a man tries to "limbo" beneath a horizontal pole. His torso parallel to 
the ground, he extends himself lower and lower until, finally, exasperated and 
breathless, he walks away. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica says it's the quitting, the sheer giving up, that makes her angry at 
the man "who could have done it, if only he'd tried." 
</P>
<P>
The last five months have been hard for Jessica Lynn Esquivel. The last five 
months have been all about not quitting, not giving up -- trying. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the 6-year-old Imperial Beach girl entered Sharp Memorial Hospital 
with what doctors first believed was a routine case of chickenpox. Within 
hours, her fever had raced to 104 degrees. Her ankles were severely bloated. 
The circulation in her arms and legs was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Entering through a pox-caused lesion, a rare strain of streptococcus bacteria 
-- the same virulent strain that killed "Muppet Man" Jim Henson, doctors say -- 
triggered a secondary infection, then brought about toxic shock. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital, where she was later admitted, say the strain of 
Type A "strep" that infected Jessica had never been seen in a child anywhere in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They say she barely survived, making her subsequent recovery all the more 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
On April 18, surgeons severed her arms at the elbow and her legs at the knee 
because the circulation in her extremities was non-existent. Her life since 
then has been spent learning to live as an amputee. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica came home June 19. On Monday afternoon, she was sitting on the couch, 
watching TV with her 4-year-old brother, Felix. She has learned a lot since 
leaving the hospital, not the least of which is dressing herself in the 
morning, standing, walking, drawing, writing her name perfectly . . . doing 
some things "normal" 6-year-olds can't do. 
</P>
<P>
"I can walk on my legs real good," she said, then began to prove it. "I've been 
to two friends' birthday parties, and just the other day, I went horseback 
riding with my mom and my dad and my little brother." 
</P>
<P>
In therapy at Children's, Jessica has learned to play games, including several 
on a computer. Doctors say her introduction to prosthetics could not have gone 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"She is doing just fine," said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for the hospital. "She 
now has all four prostheses in place and is continuing on an outpatient basis. 
We see her in physical and occupational therapy three times a week, two hours 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as last week, she took steps for the first time. She's gaining 
strength and dexterity with all four limbs, and both arm prostheses seem quite 
comfortable and natural to her now. She's showing all of the positive steps 
that we'd like to see at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
"We're all so proud of her," said Lisa Esquivel, Jessica's mother. "It takes 
time to get used to this . . . " 
</P>
<P>
She sighed and began again. 
</P>
<P>
"But really, she's done remarkably well. It's been easier than what I expected, 
really it has. I feel like -- at least, I hope -- the worst is behind us. 
Jessica has always been very independent, and, if anything, she's frustrated by 
not getting to be more independent. That's actually been the hard part." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she swims in a wading pool, bathes herself, and, her mother said, has 
begun to dance again. Before the illness, dance was her favorite activity. Her 
idol, then as now, is dancer-singer Paula Abdul. One of her favorite treats 
since her surgery: getting to eat in the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's favorite game is Ker Plunk, the winner being the one who gets the 
most marbles in a plastic frog's mouth. She usually wins, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Esquivel, 25, said her daughter starts school Sept. 10, enrolling as a 
first-grader at Oneonta Elementary in Imperial Beach, where she graduated with 
her kindergarten class after leaving the hospital. Her mother said that Jessica 
will attend for full days, with no restrictions, although she's hoping to get a 
job at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Her recovery has been terrific, but so many people have shown her so much 
attention that, really, it's made her just a little bit shy," Lisa Esquivel 
said. "She's become a little bit like a celebrity. Just recently, she started 
to seem more like her old self -- emotionally. Sometimes, she'll say, 'I 
can't,' and then I'll look at her, and she'll say, 'I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, Jessica read aloud the saga of "Sticky Stanley," about a boy 
who eats so much candy that his fingers stick together. She drew a detailed 
portrait of her mother, picking up the crayons with artificial fingers of steel 
and plastic, flesh-colored to resemble real fingers. One by one, she put each 
crayon back in its holder. 
</P>
<P>
Using a pink crayon, she first drew a heart, describing that as her mother's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Her most difficult task -- walking -- is something her mother says she's 
willing, even eager, to try more each day. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to a shopping center, and she insists on walking," Lisa Esquivel said. 
"If anything, she's really been pushing herself. She's very strong-willed. If 
she says she'll do something, she'll keep pushing until she can. She's talking 
about wanting to water-ski now. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica clearly took pride in her ability to perform normal tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I like to take my socks and shoes off," she said. When asked why, 
she smiled and said, "When my feet are sweating." 
</P>
<P>
But she also has more lofty plans. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, she wants to be a fashion designer, then a computer programmer, then 
a nun!" her mother said. "Now, she wants to be a teacher, I think because she 
likes her teachers (at Children's) so much." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Esquivel and husband, Felix, have hired an attorney, medical malpractice 
specialist David D. Miller. They haven't filed a lawsuit but might do so, 
Miller has said, because of treatment administered to Jessica before she was 
admitted to Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Esquivel said she and her daughter were sent home twice from Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista, where Jessica was taken on the night of March 
30 and a few hours later on the 31st. She said doctors diagnosed Jessica's 
fever and delusions as symptomatic of a "simple case of chickenpox" but failed 
to listen to her heart or take her blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Esquivel said she spoke with an emergency-room doctor, who told her "I 
worried too much." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he told my wife that she worried too much," Felix Esquivel, a 
27-year-old auto mechanic, said at the time. "But now my daughter doesn't have 
hands or feet . . . and it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Scripps have declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Esquivel said she and Jessica received "similar treatment" at a pediatric 
clinic in Imperial Beach. Lisa and Felix Esquivel have been quoted as saying 
they have no problem with treatment received at either Sharp or Children's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged," Lisa Esquivel said Monday. "But, sometimes, when I lie down 
at night, it hits me, and I'm very, very sad. I'd give anything if it hadn't 
happened. But it did, and we've got to make the best of it. All of us. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of times, we ran into people, who looked at Jess and said, 'You poor 
thing.' But if they could see her and how well she's done, I don't think they'd 
say that. She is a human being. I actually heard, indirectly, from a couple of 
people at the hospital that they thought it might have been better if Jessica 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't agree at all. I'm just so grateful, so thankful, that she's 
alive. You can't believe how happy we are about that."

S.D. LAB TECH HELPED IN LIBERIAN EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few days before Greg Huhn left San Diego to work at St. Joseph's hospital in 
Liberia this April, the U.S. State Department issued a low-key statement 
mentioning political tensions in the country's inland Nimba mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
Less than five months later, the 25-year-old lab technician found himself 
carrying amputees and war orphans from the hospital in a rush to abandon the 
coastal capital of Monrovia amid bloody fighting there. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea it was a war," Huhn said Friday in Madrid, where he and 62 other 
refugees had arrived early Thursday after a complicated, four-day rescue from 
the West African nation organized by the U.S. and Spanish governments. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got there, it was still a rebel incursion. It went from an incursion to 
a crisis and finally a war," Huhn said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the violence wracking the country of 2.3 million as "just complete 
terror." At least 5,000 people have died in the nine months of fighting between 
two main rebel factions and troops loyal to President Samuel Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, rebels led by Charles Taylor began incursions into northeast 
Liberia from neighboring Ivory Coast. They accused Doe, a former master 
sergeant who overthrew the government of William Tolbert 10 years ago, of 
rampant corruption and human rights abuse. The United States was Liberia's main 
financial backer during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels, including a breakaway faction led by Prince Johnson, now control more 
than 90% of the country, and Doe is holed up in his fortified presidential 
mansion refusing to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn was at the Madrid airport again Friday to greet 12 Roman Catholic 
missionaries, also part of the St. Joseph's hospital staff, who flew in from 
the Ivory Coast, a neighbor of Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn's group was accompanied by rebels through the jungle to the southern port 
of Buchanan. Unarmed U.S. Marines picked them up on the beach there, and 
helicoptered them to the amphibious assault ship Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
Then they were airlifted to the amphibious transport dock Ponce, which carried 
them north to the neighboring country of Sierra Leone, where a Spanish air 
force plane was awaiting them. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old hospital in the Monrovia suburb of Congo Town, had been using 
emergency generators and well water since late June. 
</P>
<P>
But the missionaries of the Spanish order of St. John of God that run the 
hospital decided to evacuate Saturday after heavy mortar and anti-aircraft gun 
shelling drove off most of the Liberian staff. They left everything behind. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn said he finally became convinced it was time to leave when a mortar shell 
exploded 15 yards from the missionaries' residence Aug. 10 as he and others 
were heading for the door. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were depending on the hospital, so I couldn't just get up and 
leave. It was the only thing functioning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn, from North City West near Del Mar, said he left his job as an immunology 
researcher at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla because he 
wanted to get beyond the laboratory and help people directly. 
</P>
<P>
He found St. Joseph's through a San Diego-based referral service, Amdoc/Option, 
and began performing a variety of tasks after his arrival April 7. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the escalation of fighting his main duty rapidly became finding 
donors to bolster scarce blood supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly desperate, he put up posters offering five cups of rice for 500 
milliliters of blood. Within a few days, he was turning away would-be donors by 
the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Huhn said he never became hardened to the grisly wounds and signs of wanton 
cruelty he saw every day in the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Two cases linger in his mind: a 9-year-old boy who had been shot in the arm by 
a government soldier after he refused to hand over his money; and a man out 
past curfew who had been forced to eat both his ears after soldiers sliced them 
off "so he could hear better." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect it," he said of the cruelty. "It's beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
Like the missionaries, who say they will reopen the hospital as soon as 
possible, Huhn would like to return to Liberia, if only to visit those friends 
who remain alive and find out about those who died. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a happier Liberia, a Liberia without suffering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the UC Berkeley graduate plans to return to Scripps. He said his 
experience has strengthened his desire to earn a medical degree.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are looking for a 24-year-old man in connection with the stabbing death 
of another man in Logan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived at the scene about 6:50 a.m. Sunday, they found Ernest 
Thomas Sharpe, 33, dead with a stab wound in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
The killing on 29th Street between Imperial Avenue and Commercial Street is 
believed to have been drug-related, said San Diego police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
He said police are looking for Jeff Gaulden of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe apparently arrived in the area with some friends and, after talking 
about drugs with a man, got into an argument with him. 
</P>
<P>
Another man then approached Sharpe with a knife, but, when Sharpe tried to run 
away, he stumbled and was stabbed, Homicide Lt. Dan Berglund said. A knife was 
found in a yard near the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Just after 1 a.m. Monday, a police SWAT team, along with eight other officers, 
sealed off an area in the 2100 block of Oceanview Boulevard because the suspect 
was thought to be holed up in a house there, Robinson said. The house turned 
out to be empty.

A Japanese student was killed when she was struck by a hit-and-run driver as 
she crossed a street in Scripps Miramar Ranch, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Naoko Shimazu, 20. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in the 9800 block of Carroll Canyon Road Sunday night, 
said Detective Chuck Vermillion of the San Diego Police Department's traffic 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"She was crossing with a friend, and he got to the other side and turned around 
in time to see her get struck," Vermillion said, who added that the woman was 
not using a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
Shimazu, who was pronounced dead at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, was 
studying English as a second language at ES International School of English, a 
private school on the United States International University campus. She had 
just completed her two-week program Saturday, said Brigitte McCarthy, director 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who have no suspects, are looking for a blue car that may have 
front-end damage on the right side.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man accused of running a methamphetamine laboratory out of his 
home was ordered Monday to stand trial in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly C. Schwartz of Rancho Bernardo is charged with manufacturing 
methamphetamine and possession of the drug with the intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz is in custody in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>

An undercover agent with the Narcotics Task Force testified that a search 
warrant was served at Schwartz's residence July 8. The officer said a working 
methamphetamine lab was found in the attic above the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz eluded arrest the day the warrant was served. He was apprehended Aug. 
7 in Poway.

Doug Dascenzo got three hits and robbed Paul O'Neill of a two-run homer Monday 
night as the visiting Chicago Cubs handed Cincinnati its fifth consecutive 
loss, beating the Reds, 3-1, in a game called in the ninth inning because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, swept at home in a four-game series by Pittsburgh during the weekend, 
had their lead cut to 5 1/2 games over the Dodgers, who beat the Philadelphia 
Phillies, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Manager Lou Piniella was furious when the game finally was called 
after three delays totaling 3 hours, 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even informed," Piniella said. "It was a very irresponsible action, 
as far as I am concerned -- extremely irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a 3-1 ballgame where we have a chance to come up in the 
bottom of the ninth and win a ballgame," he said. "There's no excuse for 
something like that, and the league office will hear about it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Dascenzo was the hero for Chicago, going three for three with a double, a run 
batted in, a walk and two stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning, with the score 1-1, Dascenzo reached over the center-field 
fence to catch O'Neill's drive. 
</P>
<P>
Cub pitcher Mike Bielecki (5-8) gave up three hits in seven innings for his 
first victory as a starter since May 27. In his previous 12 starts he was 0-5. 
Norm Charlton (9-7) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs got an unearned run in the second when Shawon Dunston got an infield 
single, stole second, went to third on shortstop Barry Larkin's two-out error 
and scored on Dascenzo's single. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, Houston 1 -- Neal Heaton pitched six shutout innings to gain his 
first victory since June 24, and Gary Redus hit a two-run homer to lead the 
Pirates at home. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, coupled with the New York Mets' 3-1 loss to San Diego, gives 
Pittsburgh a three-game lead in the National League East, its biggest since 
June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton ended his six-game losing streak as the Pirates (72-49), 23 games over 
.500 for the first time since 1979, matched their longest winning streak of the 
season -- six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, coming off a weekend four-game sweep in Cincinnati, took a 4-0 
lead in the first inning against Jim Deshaies (5-11) to help Heaton (11-8) end 
his losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton, making his 200th major league start, gave up three hits, struck out 
three and walked two. The losing streak matched the longest of his nine-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Montreal 2 -- Don Robinson pitched a four-hitter, Will Clark 
hit his 16th homer and Kevin Mitchell drove in two runs to lead the Giants at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (9-4) ended a personal three-game losing streak with his third 
complete game of the season and first by a Giant since Trevor Wilson beat the 
Dodgers Aug. 4. He struck out seven and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, losing its fourth of five games, dropped nine games behind Pittsburgh 
in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gross (8-10) lost his sixth consecutive decision, matching the longest 
skid of his career. He is winless in 10 starts since a 5-0 victory over 
Philadelphia June 11. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's homer was only his second in 157 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, New York 1 -- Bruce Hurst pitched seven shutout innings and 
Roberto Alomar homered as the Padres beat the Mets at San Diego, dropping the 
Mets three games behind in the National League East. New York has lost six of 
its last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (8-8) gave up five hits, struck out seven and walked four before Craig 
Lefferts got his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry opened the Mets' ninth with his 28th home run, tying for the 
league lead with Bobby Bonilla and Ryne Sandberg. The Mets got another hit off 
Lefferts, but could not score again. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Fernandez (8-10) gave up two runs on two hits in six innings. He struck out 
eight and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark tripled to lead off the Padres' second and scored on Benito 
Santiago's sacrifice fly. Alomar started the sixth with his fourth home run of 
the season to give San Diego a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Atlanta 2 -- Ken Hill pitched a six-hitter and Rex Hudler got 
three hits and drove in three runs as the Cardinals defeated the Braves at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Hill (4-1) won his third consecutive decision. He struck out six, walked two 
and retired 10 batters in a row before Dave Justice hit his 19th home run to 
lead off the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Hudler, making his first start in six games since sustaining a bruised 
shoulder, had a two-run single in a four-run first inning, singled in the third 
and fifth and had an RBI groundout in the seventh. In his last nine starts, 
Hudler is batting .419 (18 for 43). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Glavine (6-10) gave up six runs and seven hits in four innings to lose his 
fourth consecutive decision. He is winless in his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
Justice's home run gave him 11 in his last 16 games. He is 26 for 65 with 23 
RBIs in 17 games since Aug. 5, the day after the Braves traded Dale Murphy to 
Philadelphia. Justice leads major league rookies in home runs.

<TEXT>
<P>
George Steinbrenner's 17 1/2-year reign ended Monday night with one more news 
conference and the New York Yankees' 6-5, 11-inning victory over the Toronto 
Blue Jays at New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still part of us," Manager Stump Merrill said. "That's the important 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Blue Jays one game behind Boston in the American League 
East as the Red Sox beat Baltimore, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees won the game when Alvaro Espinoza missed a squeeze sign and chopped 
a bases-loaded single over the head of shortstop Tony Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," Espinoza said. "I missed the sign all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cadaret (5-4) pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings for the victory, yielding 
three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Maas, who hit his 15th homer in the Yankees' four-run first inning, 
opened the 11th with a walk off Jim Acker (2-3) and took second when catcher 
Pat Borders dropped Bob Geren's sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Acker pounced on Jesse Barfield's bunt and fired to third, but third baseman 
Luis Sojo failed to touch the bag and was charged with an error, loading the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Leyritz struck out, but Espinoza singled on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Geren running to third but I didn't see Maas at all," Espinoza said. "I 
was lucky I got a pitch over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 2, Baltimore 1 -- Ellis Burks' sacrifice fly in the eighth scored Carlos 
Quintana with the Red Sox's winning run at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana opened the eighth with a hit off first baseman David Segui's glove and 
took second when Segui threw to an uncovered base for an error. 
</P>
<P>
After Jeff Ballard relieved starter Pete Harnisch (9-8), Wade Boggs beat out a 
hit to first before Burks delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris (10-5) matched his career high for victories with ninth-inning help 
from Jeff Gray, who got his fourth save. Harris gave up a run and three hits 
and seven walks in eight innings. Harnisch gave up three hits but walked eight 
in eight-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 11, Oakland 1 -- Jack McDowell pitched a three-hitter to lead the White 
Sox past the Athletics at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Thomas hit a two-run triple to cap a three-run first inning, and Sammy 
Sosa added some insurance in the sixth with a two-run homer off Oakland starter 
Dave Stewart (17-9). Chicago turned the game into a rout with a five-run 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved the White Sox to within 5 1/2 games of first-place Oakland in the 
AL West. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell (10-6) settled down after allowing a first-inning run. He struck out 
eight and walked three to win his fourth straight start and post his fourth 
complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who entered the game having won six consecutive decisions, allowed 
nine hits and five earned runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Seattle 5 -- Julio Franco singled home the winning run with the bases 
loaded and none out in the bottom of the ninth to give the Rangers a 
come-from-behind victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Franco's third hit scored Pete Incaviglia and handed the Mariners their fourth 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers rallied from a 5-0 deficit to give Mike Jeffcoat (4-5) the victory. 
Mike Jackson (5-5), who came in during the Rangers' three-run seventh, was the 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Erik Hanson, who missed his last start with a stomach flu, left after 
Gary Green opened the Texas seventh with a single. Hanson was charged with 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Minnesota 1 -- Willie Wilson and Frank White hit two-run doubles 
at Kansas City and the Royals handed the Twins their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's Storm Davis (7-8) yielded a run and four hits in eight innings. 
Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
White's double in a three-run sixth inning finished Minnesota's David West 
(6-8), who yielded six Kansas City runs and and gave up seven hits. Wilson's 
double gave the Royals a 3-1 lead in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Cleveland 3 -- Dave Parker homered and drove in three runs to lead 
the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Edens (3-1), used primarily in relief, made his second start of the season 
and fourth of his career, lasting a career-high 5 2/3 innings to get his first 
victory as a starter. He gave up seven hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers broke a 2-2 tie on Bill Spiers' bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the 
fourth, scoring Robin Yount, who walked, took second on Rob Deer's infield 
groundout and went to third on an error by shortstop Felix Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gantner hit a liner off third baseman Brook Jacoby's glove for a single, 
loading the bases against Steve Olin (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Gary Sheffield singled in the fifth, stole second and continued on 
to third on catcher Sandy Alomar's throwing error. Parker singled to make it 
4-2.

How do the TV news programs round up their experts when a crisis occurs? It is 
not a hit-or-miss proposition. Every network has on call men and women from our 
leading universities, the Brookings Institute, as well as former employees of 
the State Department and the CIA -- all eager to explain what is really going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the experts come from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This is not because the people in Washington are better informed than experts 
in the rest of the country, but because it's much cheaper for the networks to 
pay their taxi fare to the studio than to fly them in from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I know so much about this is that I have a buddy, an acclaimed 
Middle East expert named Prof. Victor Fortunato, who recently wrote a book, 
"Sticking Sand in Your Head." The book predicts the downfall of Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein as soon as he runs out of suntan oil. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped by to see Fortunato at his Georgetown home, but he wasn't there. His 
wife Olga told me that he had had an emergency call from Tom Brokaw. NBC wanted 
him down at the studio to explain the rumor going around Washington that if 
King Hussein of Jordan keeps backing Iraq, he will become six inches shorter 
than he is now. 
</P>
<P>
Olga said, "Victor likes Brokaw because Tom calls him whether Victor knows 
anything about the subject or not." 
</P>
<P>
"Does Victor work exclusively for NBC?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I should say not. Last night he was the Tibetan expert on 'PrimeTime' with 
Diane Sawyer, and this morning he was interviewed about Abu Dhabi's space 
program. After he's finished with Brokaw, Victor is going to stop by Larry King 
and take a few telephone calls. Later on he'll spend 30 seconds with Ted Koppel 
on 'Nightline.' The reason that Victor is so much in demand is that he is the 
only one in America who knows where Iraq is." 
</P>
<P>
"It must be great to be an academic and to be wanted as well," I told her. 
</P>
<P>
"Victor is basically a snob, but he loves appearing on television." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that?" 
</P>
<P>
"People now recognize him on the street -- his students never did." 
</P>
<P>
Olga took me up to the second floor and said, "Victor is prepared to get the 
call day or night. When the bell tolls from '20/20' he can jump straight into 
his boots and slide down the pole over there. He has a red light on his car 
that flashes C-Span. Sometimes when Bryant Gumbel is short on information, they 
send a police car for Victor. He is probably the most sought-after crisis 
expert in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps that we live so close to all the studios. They even use him on the 
Louis Rukeyser show to explain inflation." 
</P>
<P>
"Does Victor know anything about inflation?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but most studios let him have a TelePrompTer." 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen fellows from Brookings and ex-employees of the CIA and State 
Department used as experts on the networks. What does Victor think of the 
competition?" 
</P>
<P>
"He has nothing but contempt for them. He says that most of the TV experts have 
been out of the government for so long that they are still talking about what 
President Jerry Ford should do to stop Lumumba in his tracks." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have people like Victor to set us straight," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Olga told me, "There is a saying at the networks. 'In times of crisis, one 
expert like Victor Fortunato, is worth a thousand Oprah Winfreys.' "

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SEX AND AGING

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am a newly single woman who is getting very close to her 60th 
birthday. At a recent party that I attended, I was handed a line that I had not 
heard since I was in college many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
During a conversation with one of the men there, he remarked that having sexual 
relations is good for a woman's health. When I told him that he reminded me of 
a teen-ager I once knew, he insisted he was serious. Is there anything to this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Having sexual relations can help a woman maintain her genital health. It has 
been reported that among women 60 to 70 years of age, those who engage in 
sexual relations experience less vaginal atrophy and have better lubrication. 
It should be apparent, however, that engaging in indiscriminate sexual 
relationships is not a prescription for good health, genital or otherwise, for 
either men or women.

FINDING FULFILLMENT WITH THE 'FLOW'; 
</P>
<P>
FLOW: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE, BY MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI. HARPER 
&amp; ROW. $21.95, 303 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS DAVEY, Thomas Davey is a psychologist in the Boston area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi opens his book, "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal 
Experience," with what may be the quintessential paradox of our bedraggled 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that even the least affluent among us are surrounded by 
material luxuries undreamed of even a few decades ago . . . people often end up 
feeling that their lives have been wasted, that instead of being filled with 
happiness their years were spent in anxiety and boredom." 
</P>
<P>
The author, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago, approaches 
this apparent paradox with a wide-ranging intelligence and curiosity, along 
with the social scientist's standard arsenal of questionnaires and interviews. 
Csikszentmihalyi asks what it is that leaves certain individuals feeling happy, 
alive, fulfilled. What imbues their lives with meaning and purpose? 
</P>
<P>
The author draws on the words of an extremely wide range of "informants," from 
assembly line workers to businessmen, rock climbers to musicians, teen-agers to 
septuagenarians, in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
With their help, Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can 
intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of 
this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our 
happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. 
</P>
<P>
We are happiest not in pursuit of external remedies to our malaise -- money, 
sex, or power for their own sake, but when we are fully absorbed in meaningful 
activity -- be it intellectual, physical, artistic or spiritual -- to the 
degree that we can "forget" ourselves, only to reemerge from such an experience 
feeling even more ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we are more fulfilled to the degree our lives "make sense" to 
us. We are, after all, a meaning-making creature, and we are happiest when we 
are evolving a "greater complexity of consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Developmental psychology has demonstrated that the growth of the self is 
predicated on active interaction with the environment, at the physical, 
cognitive and emotional level. 
</P>
<P>
The author suggests that as adults we cease this active participation with our 
world. We let others ascribe to us our meaning. We lose what Walker Percy 
called our "sovereignty," and, with that, any chance for genuine happiness. 
</P>
<P>
Csikszentmihalyi is fairly explicit about the nature of the activities that are 
most conducive to this sort of growth. 
</P>
<P>
They offer an opportunity for deep concentration, a sense of control and 
satisfaction, behavior that is goal-directed and bounded by rules, and the 
disappearance of concern for the self. When these conditions converge, we 
experience what the author calls "flow." 
</P>
<P>
A "flow" experience, unlike the passive experiences of shopping, watching 
television, taking drugs (all of which tend to numb or distract us from our 
feelings), generally leads to that "greater complexity of consciousness," 
continually expanding our sense of who we are. And it feels good, for we become 
the architects, not the recipients of our life's meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The content of "flow" experiences is not critical: For the rock climber, "flow" 
can arise in the purposeful absorption in the task of scaling a precipice; 
whereas for an itinerant quoted at length, "flow" is experienced in the effort 
to fit life experiences into his evolving knowledge of God's will. 
</P>
<P>
This book also offers a deep cultural critique. Although Csikszentmihalyi 
acknowledges there are psychological and neurological impediments to 
experiencing "flow," he attacks 20th-Century Western culture for fostering the 
belief that happiness and fulfillment are materially rooted and outside the 
self. 
</P>
<P>
These arguments and observations are not altogether original; yet the manner in 
which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal 
psychology and spirituality is illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
At times the book leaves the reader with the sense of an overreaching and 
ambitious application of a good idea, and yet there are important questions 
left unaddressed. 
</P>
<P>
Why, for instance, are some people able to create the kind of meaning out of 
early trauma that allows them to go on to live productive and fulfilling lies, 
while others get bogged down in despair? And how to differentiate between the 
murderer and the artist, the one utterly absorbed and even finding meaning in 
the details of the execution, the other in his creation? But perhaps it is not 
for a book such as this, but rather for the novelist or the theologian to shed 
a more penetrating light on such questions.

CHILDREN OF DIVORCE; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY: HOW KIDS HANDLE THE STRESS MAY DETERMINE HOW THEY FARE IN THE LONG RUN. 
TO REDUCE THEIR ANXIETY, A NEW SCHOOL PROGRAM TEACHES COPING TECHNIQUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the months after the breakup of her marriage, Joni Pierson sometimes sat 
down with her seemingly stoic 5-year-old daughter and gently encouraged her to 
talk about the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was afraid to express her feelings in that she was afraid she'd 
upset me," said Pierson, of West Los Angeles, whose divorce became final in 
1987. "I thought it unusual that she was not having a reaction. I would sit and 
talk to her and ask her how she felt about it. Her response was, 'It's fine. 
I'm all right.' I knew it wasn't OK." 
</P>
<P>
It's hardly surprising that children whose parents divorce experience 
considerable distress at the time of the breakup. Divorce rates have tripled 
since the 1960s. And despite a recent leveling off in the rate, about 60% of 
marriages will end in divorce, and 50% of all children will experience their 
parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
But an eight-year study has shown that how children fare in the long run has 
less to do with getting through the period immediately surrounding the divorce 
and more to do with how they deal with the long-term pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Even in stressful situations, children can learn techniques to minimize their 
anxiety, says JoAnne Pedro-Carroll, a researcher at the University of 
Rochester, New York, who has long been involved with studying the effects of 
divorce on children. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro-Carroll is the founder of the Children of Divorce Intervention Program, a 
school-based program to help children deal with divorce. The program was 
started when Pedro-Carroll, then a doctoral candidate at the University of 
Rochester, noticed the profound impact divorce often had on children exhibiting 
behavior and emotional problems in school. The program, which has spread 
throughout the nation and several countries, will be introduced in some 
California school districts this year. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing children of intact homes with children from divorced homes over 
several years, Pedro-Carroll has been able to identify common problems and 
behaviors experienced by the children of divorce and devise tactics to help 
them cope. 
</P>
<P>
The study also has provided valuable information on how parents can help their 
children adjust to divorce. One of the biggest mistakes parents make is 
expecting children to recover quickly from their sadness over the divorce, says 
Linda Alpert-Gillis, a psychologist who works with Pedro-Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
"They want the child to be happy about it too quickly," she says. "You don't 
have to dwell on it, but you have to accept the unhappy feelings for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The age of the child at the time of divorce makes a big difference in how 
children respond, says Pedro-Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Children ages 5 to 8 are more openly sad and may blame themselves for the 
breakup. The younger children may yearn for the parent who has moved out of the 
home and may have greater fears of abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
Children ages 9 to 12 are more angry and resentful. Children in this age group 
may think the divorce wasn't inevitable, and they often look to blame one 
parent while siding with the other, Pedro-Carroll says. 
</P>
<P>
Even six years after he and his wife separated, Stan Haymaker says his two 
children continue to react differently. 
</P>
<P>
His son, 10, has not performed up to his abilities in school and routinely 
tests the limits of behavior at home, says Haymaker of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to my son testing everything and everyone . . . my daughter (age 9) 
is exactly the opposite, which is the way she handles things. She goes out of 
her way to please everyone." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says: "Whenever it's wishbone time with the turkey, he and my daughter 
both have the same wish. They want mommy and daddy back together again. This is 
something that has overshadowed their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Children of all ages "need to know what will happen to them" as a first order 
of business after the breakup, Alpert-Gillis says. It is a mistake to assume a 
child is too young to understand, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, how children adjust to divorce is shaped by three factors, the 
study found: 
</P>
<P>
* The parents' relationships with and expectations of their children. 
</P>
<P>
* A supportive home environment, even in the midst of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
* The extent to which former spouses are able to cooperate and negotiate 
solutions to the children's development. 
</P>
<P>
A good parent-child relationship can buffer a child from many effects of 
divorce, Alpert-Gillis says. For example, the breakup of the marriage should 
not lead to the breakdown of family rules and routines. Parents should be as 
consistent about discipline as they were before the divorce. Parents should 
also schedule time for fun with children. 
</P>
<P>
"In stressful situations, regular bedtimes and mealtimes allow children to feel 
safe and comfortable," Alpert-Gillis says. "There is an adult there who can 
control the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Joni Pierson says she quickly realized that her children cope best when they 
followed a schedule, including established visits with each parent. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's done consistently, they deal with going there much better," she says 
of the visitation periods. "But when, at the last minute, plans are changed, 
they then become uncomfortable about going the next time." 
</P>
<P>
Children who fare well have an adult in their lives, such as a parent or 
teacher, who promotes the child's self-esteem, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"These resilient kids have someone in their life that makes them feel 
valuable," Alpert-Gillis says. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should encourage children to discuss their feelings, as Pierson tried 
to do with her daughter, Alpert-Gillis adds. Sometimes, it is best for the 
child to talk to a close family friend or grandparent. Parents should brace for 
a barrage of negative feelings from the child. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's important for the parents to acknowledge these feelings rather than 
to turn away," she says. "Don't try to talk a child out of a feeling, such as 
by buying them something." 
</P>
<P>
Parents should reassure children, especially younger children, that the divorce 
is the parents' problem. Adult problems that often accompany divorce, such as 
financial difficulties, depression and anger at the ex-spouse, should be kept 
from the child, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the child be a child," Alpert-Gillis says. "Don't put responsibilities on 
them that they are not ready for." 
</P>
<P>
Parents commonly make the severe mistake of displaying their rage at the 
ex-spouse in front of the child, Pedro-Carroll says. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most serious problems for parents is not being able to encapsulate 
their own rage and letting it spill over in front of the children," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Warring parents should avoid criticizing each other or arguing in front of a 
child, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep conflict to yourself and away from your children. Parent conflict can be 
devastating to kids," Alpert-Gillis says. "Children want to love both parents 
even when terrible things happen in the family. It's a child trait to stand by 
the parent and love them no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, children are often shattered when drawn into custody battles, 
Pedro-Carroll says. A recent California study confirmed children have more 
problems adjusting when joint custody is imposed on warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
"What the children say is how awful it is for parents to be in protracted 
litigation," Pedro-Carroll says. "We hear children say, 'Please spare us the 
gory details.' They don't want to hear about that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS FOR PARENTS 
</P>
<P>
* Understand the impact of divorce on children. 
</P>
<P>
* Prepare your children for the changes involved in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
* Accept children's feelings and encourage them to express their feelings in 
constructive ways. 
</P>
<P>
* Reassure your children. 
</P>
<P>
* Allow your child to continue to be a child. 
</P>
<P>
* Give children permission to love both parents. 
</P>
<P>
* Solve problems together. 
</P>
<P>
* Work on your relationship with your children. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep the conflict to yourselves. 
</P>
<P>
* Maintain as much structure and predictability as possible in your daily 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
* Listen to children's verbal and nonverbal communication. 
</P>
<P>
* Take care of yourself.

Colombia has more than doubled the reward for information leading to the arrest 
of drug lord Pablo Escobar to almost $1 million, according to a new army 
pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers handed out the pamphlets in Colombia's cocaine center of Medellin 
during the weekend, offering $960,000 for information on Escobar, residents 
said. The new amount is more than twice the $385,000 reward previously offered 
for Escobar, the boss of the Medellin cocaine cartel. The authorities regard 
him as public enemy No. 1, responsible for ordering scores of bombings and the 
assassinations of dozens of people.

India placed its troops on alert across its northern border with Pakistan after 
clashes were reported with Pakistani troops in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the clashes as "a major border incident," United News of India said 
that according to unconfirmed reports at least 10 Pakistanis were killed. The 
clashes reportedly occurred in the Kupwara sector of the disputed frontier, 
about 60 miles northeast of Srinagar, India. Earlier, Pakistanis fired heavy 
artillery with explosive and incendiary shells at Indian border posts in 
Jammu-Kashmir state, an India government spokesman said. Pakistan's Defense 
Ministry denied that charge.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHIROPRACTOR BEGINS TERM FOR BILLING SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles chiropractor who pleaded no contest to 14 felony and tax fraud 
charges in a phony billing scheme that bilked insurance companies out of more 
than $400,000 has begun serving a five-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert MacKenzie said Theodore Roosevelt Wyatt conspired 
with some of his patients over a three-year period to submit fraudulent bills 
to their insurance companies, then divided the proceeds with them. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 patients helped Wyatt prepare false insurance claims for 
non-existent treatment, investigators said. Wyatt paid some his patients $50 
finders fees to recruit others for the scheme.

BANK FRAUD FIGURE GETS 4-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside businessman involved in what officials have called the biggest bank 
fraud scheme in Ventura County history was sentenced Monday to four years in a 
federal prison and fined $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Vladovich, the central figure in a scheme in which $4 million in loans 
from Westlake Thrift and Loan was channeled into a Riverside company, Leader 
Video, will be eligible for parole in about a year, Assistant U.S. Atty. David 
C. Scheper said. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal sources, the FBI's two-year investigation into the 
Vladovich case and into the demise of Westlake Thrift has turned to the 
thrift's now defunct parent company, United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, 
which the state closed in December because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Targets of the FBI's probe into possible bank fraud include United Community's 
former chairman, Phil Chase of Thousand Oaks, and board member Olen B. Phillips 
of Westlake Village. Phillips, an airline pilot, is also being investigated by 
state and Ventura County officials for alleged fraud in real estate 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Vladovich, who set out in the mid-1980s to build the largest chain of 
video stores in the nation, pleaded guilty to nine counts of conspiracy, 
unlawful payment of bribes and bank fraud in connection with the Westlake 
scheme. He could have faced up to 45 years in prison and $2.25 million in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal sources, Vladovich and members of his sales staff 
processed more than 800 phony loans that were eventually funneled into his 
would-be video empire. The loan packages were submitted to the thrift on behalf 
of people who supposedly were trying to open video rental businesses. 
</P>
<P>
One source told The Times that initially, Vladovich tried to recruit people to 
apply for the loans, including California Highway Patrol officers. But the 
patrol officers asked too many questions, the source said, and many of the 
loans eventually went to fictitious people. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Smith, the former president of the defunct thrift, was sentenced in 
April to two years in a federal prison and fined $20,000 for his role in the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scheper, Smith became involved in early 1987 when he discovered 
the thrift had already approved more than $2 million in bogus loans to 
Vladovich. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of "blowing the whistle" on the scheme, Scheper said, Smith went along 
with Vladovich's plan and approved another $2 million in phony loans, 
apparently in the hope that a successful Vladovich would eventually repay the 
bank. Instead, the scheme contributed to the thrift's failure. TINA DAUNT

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate panel has ruled that Mobil Oil Corp. and two of its former 
executives must stand trial on misdemeanor charges stemming from a fatal 1988 
explosion at the company's Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court appeals panel ruling overturns South Bay Municipal Court 
Judge Thomas Allen's dismissal last year of charges against Mobil and former 
managers Wyman Robb and Tom Gregory. Allen had ruled that the parties were not 
criminally liable for the explosion because it was caused by a private 
contractor, Cal Cat Chemical Co. 
</P>
<P>
The July 15, 1988, explosion left one Cal Cat employee dead and another 
seriously burned.

A Simi Valley man, annoyed by noise from a neighbor's house, was arrested after 
he fired shots at the neighbor and his friend, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Wright, 52, was being held in the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Neal Rein of the Simi Valley Police Department said Wright was angered by 
noise that his neighbor, Bruce Anthony, was making while working on a car about 
9:40 p.m. Sunday. Wright walked over to Anthony's house and the two began 
arguing, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright then pulled out a handgun and fired several rounds at Anthony and 
Anthony's friend, Ernst Stirnkorb, 67, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Anthony and Stirnkorb fled. Neither was injured, Rein said. CAROL WATSON

<P>
COUNTY SUES TO HALT REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County has filed a suit against the city of Santa Paula and that city's 
Redevelopment Agency, saying the agency's approval July 16 of a redevelopment 
plan is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Friday, says the city's general plan, upon which the project is 
based, is inadequate and does not meet government codes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Santa Paula has not proved that the formation of the Redevelopment 
Agency will not financially hurt the county. "The $240-million project will 
cost us more than $80 million over the 40 years it is planned to run," said 
County Counsel Daniel F. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula City Councilman Les Maland said, however, that the county 
ultimately would benefit from the project, because property values would rise, 
thereby generating more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Under redevelopment, the city's property tax base is frozen so taxing agencies, 
such as the county, no longer automatically receive revenue from a rise in 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Such taxing bodies must come to an agreement, called a pass-through, with the 
Redevelopment Agency on the percentage of the increment they will receive. 
Because of the size of the area, which at 30% of the city far exceeds the 8% 
that the county allows for redevelopment projects, the county says it is 
entitled to a 100% pass-through. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency's environmental impact report is also deficient, 
Murphy said, because it does not address such areas as the effects of 
redevelopment upon traffic outside the project area. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson responded by saying the lawsuit was expected. "We 
. . . understand the county feels it has to do it. But I have to defend Santa 
Paula because it needs and deserves a redevelopment project." AMELIA CHAFFEE

THE BUENAVENTURA MISSION AQUEDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN KUSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
* HISTORY: Built between 1792 and 1815 by Chumash Indians, under the direction 
of either a Franciscan priest from the San Buenaventura Mission, trained in 
hydrology, or of stonemasons brought from Mexico. The seven-mile-long aqueduct 
supplied water for about 350 mission residents and for crop irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
* LOCATION: Only some sections have been 
</P>
<P>
unearthed. It begins one mile north of the confluence of San Antonio Creek and 
the Ventura River, and snakes south to the mission. The largest section, the 
Canada Larga, is at 234 Canada Larga Road. 
</P>
<P>
* HOURS: Shown by appointment only. Contact the county Cultural Heritage Board 
at 654-3967. 
</P>
<P>
The Buenaventura Mission aqueduct once stretched seven miles to the ocean, but 
urban growth and vandals have reduced the county's oldest landmark to rubble. 
All that remains are a few buried sections and a 100-foot-long piece protected 
by a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
The stone and mortar structure was built by Chumash Indians sometime between 
1792 and 1815. Less than a quarter of a mile, including the seven-foot-high 
Canada Larga section, remains. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, a series of channels gradually sloped from a dam on the San Antonio 
Creek, about one mile north of its junction with the Ventura River, to the San 
Buenaventura Mission. The Canada Larga section served as a siphon, drawing 
water uphill through covered conduits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a remarkable structure," said Robert Lopez, an archeology professor at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
The aqueduct provided a dependable water supply that allowed the mission to 
flourish. But it is also credited with changing the Chumash Indians from 
hunters and gatherers to farmers, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The aqueduct's origins remain a mystery. Some historians have said construction 
began in 1792, 10 years after Father Junipero Serra founded the San 
Buenaventura Mission. Others place construction between 1805 and 1815, after 
the arrival of Mexican stonemasons. Another puzzle involves the design of the 
aqueduct. Some archeologists maintain that it was the brainchild of a 
Franciscan priest with military training in hydrologic engineering, while 
others claim it was inspired by the ancient Romans. 
</P>
<P>
Sections of the aqueduct were destroyed during an 1861 flood. Later, settlers 
used its stones to build foundations for houses or tore it down to plant crops. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-foot-wide hole was blown in the Canada Larga section in 1900 to make way 
for a dirt road through Weldon Canyon. Fearing further damage, officials fenced 
off the remaining portion in 1977, five years after it was declared a county 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have located seven sections of the aqueduct, including a 
ground-level stone channel, east of Ventura Avenue between Vince and Lewis 
streets, that served as an unpaved parking lot until the city declared it a 
historical landmark in 1982. CAROLYN KUSKY

CANCELED CLASSES FRUSTRATE STUDENTS AT VALLEY, PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman registration at Pierce College got off to a rough start Monday morning 
when the computers went down for an hour. For Victor Von Wright, an incoming 
cinema major, things didn't get much better when the screens blinked on again. 
</P>
<P>
Von Wright, 44, learned after waiting in line for 90 minutes that an 
introductory class required for his cinema major had been axed as part of a 
budgetary squeeze in the Los Angeles Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
He replaced the class with a civil rights course that fit his schedule but not 
his interests. "We all get sucked up in the system and thrown out," he said 
bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
Von Wright's fall-term class section was one of about 100 that Pierce canceled 
to save money, said William Norlund, the community college's vice president of 
academic affairs. The school planned to offer roughly 2,000 class sections this 
semester, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills campus was ordered by the college district this month to cut 
its 1990-91 budget by about $1 million, after the district discovered it had 
overestimated the amount of money it would receive from state lottery revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College in Van Nuys, also ordered to trim its budget by $1 million, has 
canceled 130 of its 1,800 planned fall class sections because of the district 
reductions, college President Mary Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those classes, an intermediate-level speech course, would have included 
Garth Kline, an electronics major from Van Nuys who said he had hoped the class 
would help him overcome his minor speech impediment. "I wasn't angry," Kline 
said. "I was just puzzled. Out there in the real world I need it. I need to 
work on my speech." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Parrillo, a 19-year-old incoming Pierce business major, was angry that he 
had not been told before he arrived to register that his accounting class had 
been canceled. "I really wanted to get the harder classes out of the way at the 
beginning," he said. "Now I've got to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators said they cut those class sections with the lowest enrollments. 
At Pierce, the departments of agriculture, electronics, nursing and physical 
education have been hardest hit, Norlund said. At Valley, the speech, English, 
and mathematics departments are suffering the most significant cutbacks, Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Valley and Pierce administrators said they took pains to distribute the 
cutbacks throughout the curriculum, ensuring that although a particular course 
would be taught less frequently, neither the course itself nor an entire 
academic department would be eliminated. "We have reduced programs," Lee said, 
"but we have not eliminated programs." 
</P>
<P>
Valley plans to cut an additional 120 class sections in the spring, Lee said. 
Pierce expects to reduce its number of spring course offerings by 300, Norlund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the cutbacks argued that by making it less convenient for community 
college students to take the courses they need to graduate, the colleges may 
discourage some of their students from continuing with their education. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the student we're trying to save in California -- the at-risk student," 
said Jack Sterk, president of Valley's faculty and chairman of the school's 
speech and broadcasting department, which lost 28% of its class sections as a 
result of the budget cuts. "It's that level of student that gets hurt the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sterk noted, the class cutbacks come as enrollment at community 
colleges is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to students, part-time teachers will feel the effect of the 
district's belt-tightening measures. Full-time teachers are salaried and 
tenured, so colleges save teaching money only by canceling those courses taught 
by part-time professors, administrators said. Full-time teachers who taught a 
class that was canceled simply will teach another course previously taught by a 
part-time professor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission College, with 530 class sections the smallest facility in the Valley, 
will cut from its budget the $332,000 mandated by the district without reducing 
its course offerings this fall, Business Manager Jim Austin said. The college 
will cut such non-instructional expenses as office supplies, maintenance and 
substitute clerical work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mission, now in the process of building a new campus in Sylmar, may have to 
cut its class offerings next semester if it does not raise additional state or 
federal money over the next several months, Austin said. "If we cannot generate 
funding for this campus," he said, "we would have a drastic reduction in the 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
Area community colleges outside the San Fernando Valley reported that they had 
not reduced class offerings for the fall semester. The College of the Canyons, 
which is not part of the Los Angeles district, may have to cut its class 
schedule in the spring if new funding sources cannot be found, said Jim Walker, 
vice president for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Community College, also separate from the Los Angeles Community 
College District, and thus not told to reduce its budget, is offering more 
courses this fall than it did last fall, spokesman Steve Standerfer said.

LAWYER ADMITS EVIDENCE LINKS CLIENT TO KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual legal maneuver designed to protect his client from the death 
penalty, a defense attorney conceded Monday that evidence implicates the 
defendant in the slaying of an 8-year-old Northridge boy. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Duane Dammeyer has asked Ventura County Superior Court 
Judge Steven Perren to exclude Gregory Scott Smith from the death penalty in 
the killing of Paul Bailly, whose bound and burned body was found in a field 
near Simi Valley on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
According to California law, the death penalty applies only when a murder takes 
place in the course of a separate felony. 
</P>
<P>
Dammeyer filed a motion Aug. 6 to have the death penalty provision removed from 
the criminal complaint upon which Smith's trial is to be based. He argued that 
evidence from a June 4 preliminary hearing shows that Smith abducted Paul with 
the intent to kill him, thereby making the crime a single felony. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris filed a reply Aug. 17, saying that the 
kidnaping and the slaying were separate acts. It argues that Smith kidnaped the 
boy to punish him for complaining to school officials. The school had fired 
Smith from his job as a day-care aide in the latchkey program partly because 
Paul complained that Smith was picking on him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith then killed Paul to get revenge against Darby Avenue School, according to 
Kossoris' brief. 
</P>
<P>
Dammeyer is scheduled to argue the motion before Perren on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bailly disappeared March 23 after his mother dropped him off at the 
day-care program at Darby Avenue School in Canoga Park. Paul's body was found 
several hours later in a field in the Santa Susana Knolls area in Simi Valley. 
Prosecutors have alleged that Smith abducted Paul, gagged him with duct tape 
and strangled him, then set fire to his body. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence of an intent to kidnap, separate and apart from the intent 
to kill," Dammeyer said. "The law requires a separate intent to kidnap, an 
independent purpose apart from just taking a person to a secluded area to kill 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the evidence implicates Smith will not prevent his attorneys 
from trying to convince a jury that he is innocent, prosecutors predicted. 
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said that Dammeyer's motion creates 
"rather unusual circumstances," forcing Smith's attorneys to admit that 
evidence points to their client. But McGee said the jury will be unaware of the 
argument over the death penalty.

torture.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER ARRESTED IN DEATH OF CYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old Van Nuys man was arrested Monday as a suspect in a hit-and-run 
accident in which a bicycle rider was struck and killed by a pickup truck, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Melgoza, 28, was arrested after police received information from witnesses 
to the accident, which occurred at 10 p.m. Sunday on Roscoe Boulevard near 
White Oak Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man in his early 20s was riding west on Roscoe near the curb 
when he was struck from behind by a pickup that did not stop, Detective Dennis 
Ulick said. The victim was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where 
he died about an hour later. He carried no identification and investigators had 
not learned his name Monday, Ulick said. 
</P>
<P>
One of three witnesses followed the truck until he got its license plate 
number, Ulick said. The pickup was traced to a Van Nuys address where police 
took five men into custody for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the five provided information that led to Melgoza, who was found 
early Monday at another Van Nuys apartment and later confessed to being the 
driver when the truck hit the bike rider. The five were released after 
questioning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Melgoza was being held on suspicion of felony hit and run but investigators 
will ask prosecutors to charge him in the victim's death, police said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN LOST IN KERN RIVER IS PRESUMED DROWNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park man disappeared while tubing in the Kern River Saturday night and 
is presumed to have drowned, Kern County Sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos Rayes, 23 was last seen crossing a levee in the Kern River in an inner 
tube. 
</P>
<P>
"He went over a small levee where the velocity of the water increases and 
disappeared after that," said Deputy Richard Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Three divers and 19 members of the search and rescue team searched for Rayes 
Saturday night and Sunday. The search was called off Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, he's reported missing and presumed dead," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rayes was in a non-restricted area near Hart Memorial Park in 
northeastern Bakersfield, the swift waters are often difficult to navigate, 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We highly recommend that people not swim in the Kern River," he said. "It's 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
This year, six people have drowned in the Kern River, including an 18-year-old 
Maywood man who drowned last month while swimming in a restricted area.

CHANNEL ISLANDS AIR NATIONAL GUARD UNIT GEARS UP FOR POSSIBLE CALL TO THE 
MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The base commander of an Air National Guard unit that recently moved from Van 
Nuys to Ventura County has put 1,400 active duty and reserve personnel on a 
"heightened state of awareness" in preparation for a possible call to the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been advising our people to get their personal affairs in order," said 
Col. Daniel H. Pemberton, commander of the Channel Islands Air National Guard 
Base adjacent to Point Mugu. "We have been getting our recall rosters in order 
and we have been taking inventory of all our personnel and supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Pemberton said the National Guard unit, which includes a fleet of 16 C-130 
Hercules transport planes, has not been put on any special standby status or 
heightened state of readiness. "But prudence dictates that we gear up for what 
might be coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, President Bush began preparing to act on a Pentagon request 
for permission to call up as many as 150,000 members of the National Guard and 
other reserve units to meet critical shortages of support troops in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The principal mission of the Channel Islands guard unit, which moved from Van 
Nuys in March, and most of whose members live in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties, is to haul military cargo. The base's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing has 
16 C-130 Hercules transport planes designed to carry military supplies and 
troops relatively short distances. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands base also has a military police unit, a civilian 
engineering unit for emergency construction, a 170-member air medical 
evacuation unit and an air medical tactical hospital of about 50 personnel 
qualified to administer medical aid in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Combat operations are not new to the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing, which 
provided air support in the Korean and Vietnam wars. More recently, a portion 
of the wing was used in the military mission to topple Panamanian leader Manuel 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The guard unit moved 1,647 passengers and more than 363 tons of cargo in that 
operation, which won high praise from other U.S. forces in Panama for grueling 
hours in the air and missions flown under "lights-out" conditions that included 
some blackout landings. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands base has 320 full-time members and about 1,100 reservists 
who report to duty on scheduled weekends and go on training missions once a 
year.

EXCEPT AL WEST, DIVISION RACES WORTH WATCHING

<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-August of a season that has produced a spring training lockout, a prison 
sentence for baseball's all-time hit leader and a permanent suspension of the 
New York Yankees' owner, attention may finally focus on what remains of the 
pennant races. 
</P>
<P>
What is the status of the season with 6 1/2 weeks remaining, that half-week 
being the rescheduled fallout of the season-delaying lockout? 
</P>
<P>
Who's alive? Who's not? 
</P>
<P>
It can be said with some certainty that one race is already over. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, bidding for a third consecutive American League pennant 
and threatening to build a dynasty in an era of parity, have virtually wrapped 
up the Western Division title, burying everyone except the surprising Chicago 
White Sox in what was thought to be baseball's strongest division. 
</P>
<P>
The A's and White Sox are currently playing a three-game series, but regardless 
of the outcome, it seems inconceivable that the A's -- with their arsenal of 
weapons and the best home and road records in baseball -- will blow a lead of 5 
1/2 games to an overachieving team that has been forced to use an average of 
almost four pitchers a game, straining what has been a productive bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
For the A's, who have won eight of their last 11 games, the final 6 1/2 weeks 
will be used primarily to heal -- principally Jose Canseco's injured back and 
Rickey Henderson's tender hamstring -- and to gear up for the playoffs, though 
Manager Tony La Russa never allows the A's to gear down. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that Oakland's 77-44 record before Monday's loss was the 
same as it was in 1988, when the A's won 104 games and finished with a 13-game 
lead, and was four games superior to last year's, when the A's won 99 games and 
finished with a seven-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
If the A's win 99 again, requiring a modest pace of .550, the White Sox will 
have to win 29 of their final 43 to tie, a .674 percentage compared to their 
.588 pace for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The A's might not have iced the champagne yet, but they have chilled the 
division. Of the hot races elsewhere, it may be a concern to baseball that so 
few teams are involved. 
</P>
<P>
There is still hope for some in the mathematics, but in reality it comes down 
to the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets in the National League East, and the 
Cincinnati Reds, Dodgers and San Francisco Giants -- provincially stretching 
some -- in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
AL EAST 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who lead the Blue Jays by one game, will play a four-game series 
starting Thursday in Toronto and a three-game series against the Blue Jays in 
Boston on the final weekend of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox have won five of six from the Blue Jays and seem to have an edge in 
the schedule considering: a) they will play their final eight games at home 
while the Blue Jays play their final nine on the road, and b) they will play 23 
of their final 42 games at home, where they are 38-20, compared to 27-35 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Red Sox and Blue Jays have been enigmas, to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
Boston led the league in team batting as of Monday but was 12th in runs, 13th 
in home runs, 14th in stolen bases and first in two categories it would prefer 
not to be: number of times shut out and number of double plays grounded into. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto leads the league in runs with 600, an average of 4.9 a game, but is 
seventh in earned-run average, the inconsistent performance of a staff 
considered one of the deepest and best having diluted that consistently potent 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, however, had lowered their ERA from 4.38 in May to 4.24 in June 
to 3.90 as of Monday and approached the stretch with six sound starters: Dave 
Stieb (16-4), Jimmy Key (8-6), David Wells (9-3), Todd Stottlemyre (11-13), 
John Candelaria (7-5) and John Cerutti (8-8). All have been down this road 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, after Roger Clemens (18-5) and Mike Boddicker (11-8), have been 
operating with mirrors. How Greg Harris (10-5) and rookies Tom Bolton (7-2) and 
Dana Kiecker (4-5) hold up remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Also, only time will tell if the Red Sox can survive without relief ace Jeff 
Reardon, whose anticipated late-September return from a back injury is still 
uncertain. Since July 21, when Reardon blew a save in his last appearance, the 
Boston bullpen is 1-4 with with five saves and three blown saves. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy, who is 0-6, has now been replaced as the closer by a 27-year-old 
rookie appropriately named Jeff Gray. Nothing with these two teams is black and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
NL WEST 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, seeking to become the first team since introduction of the 162-game 
schedule in 1961 to lead wire to wire, have six games left with the Dodgers and 
four with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
They also play their last nine games at home, while the Dodgers play their last 
nine and 20 of their last 41 on the road, where they are 28-33. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 5 1/2 games, the Dodgers are 5-7 against the Reds and will 
seemingly have to sweep those six games while avoiding a deadlock in six games 
with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough road in many ways, particularly since Tim Belcher has joined Orel 
Hershiser on the disabled list. Jim Neidlinger and Mike Hartley must get used 
to their major league starting roles amid the pressure of a stretch drive. They 
are all "must" victories for the Dodgers now, and 22-year-old Ramon Martinez 
carries the burden of ace. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, although they boast the league's top ERA of 3.31, are in something of 
a similar bind. Danny Jackson is on the disabled list with a shoulder injury 
and may be lost for the season, Tom Browning is temporarily sidelined by a 
sprained ankle, and Jack Armstrong has lost six of his last seven decisions. 
Rick Mahler, Scott Scudder and rookie Chris Hammond, 14-1 at Nashville, are 
being asked to pitch some key games. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds opened the door again for the Dodgers and Giants by losing four in a 
row to the Pirates during the weekend, but pitching wasn't as critical as the 
absence of key hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are second in the NL in team batting but seventh in runs. Eric Davis, 
representing the heart of the order, is batting .224, unable to shake a 
yearlong slump. The Reds have gotten this far before. They may need heart in 
more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
NL EAST 
</P>
<P>
The Mets and A's share baseball's best home record of 40-22, but the Mets play 
only 19 more games at home, compared to 23 on the road, where they are 28-29. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, three games behind, are 6-4 against the Pirates but play six of their 
remaining eight games against the Pirates in Three Rivers Stadium, including 
the last three of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates will play 23 games at home and 19 on the road, and have played well 
everywhere in response to predictions that they would fold, yielding inevitably 
to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Pittsburgh is solid top to bottom, with MVP candidate Barry Bonds 
at the forefront of an offense featuring Bobby Bonilla, Andy Van Slyke and Jeff 
King. The Pirates also have a deceptively deep pitching staff that has a better 
ERA than the celebrated Mets, 3.53 to 3.63. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen pitchers -- one shy of the major league record -- have posted at least 
one win for the Pirates, and eight have registered at least one save. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek (16-5) has emerged as a stopper in the rotation, Zane Smith is 2-0 
since his win-now acquisition from Montreal and rookie Randy Tomlin has a 1.93 
ERA in three starts since his recall from double A, taking the place of Bob 
Walk, on the disabled list with a groin strain. And Monday night, Neal Heaton 
(11-8) got his first victory since June 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have outscored the Pirates by 29 runs, but Darryl Strawberry has only 
three homers in his last 26 games and Kevin McReynolds three in his last 46. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have that splendid pitching and a 68-51 record under manager Bud 
Harrelson, but the Pirates have shaken off each of New York's challenges, 
creating the impression that these Bucs may not stop here, which would be one 
of 1990's biggest stories -- on or off the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

PADRES IN THE HUNT TO HAVE STRAWBERRY AFIELD; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BEFORE THE PADRES' 3-1 VICTORY MONDAY OVER THE METS, THE NEW YORK 
SLUGGER SAYS HE'D PREFER TO PLAY FOR AN NATIONAL LEAGUE TEAM IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fan letter was awaiting Dwight Gooden when he arrived Monday afternoon to 
the New York Mets' clubhouse. It was like so many of the others, berating him 
and his buddy, right fielder Darryl Strawberry, with an accompanying clipping 
from a Philadelphia newspaper to support his views. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry took his turn reading the letter, shook his head, and said to 
Gooden, "It's never going to change, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years Strawberry has put up with abuse of not living up to 
expectations of being the next Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
He doubts if he'll stick around for another. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry said Monday before the Padres' 3-1 victory over the Mets in front of 
22,497 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium that he'll definitely file for free 
agency at the end of the season, and if the Padres so desire, he just might be 
willing to play the outfield for them in time for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very seriously I'll be back," said Strawberry, who went two for four 
with a home run Monday and was batting .278 this season with a team-leading 28 
homers and 79 RBIs. "It hasn't been a whole lot of fun. It's been one of those 
years where they lead me down a path, and then pushed me off a dropoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had enough. I'll go where I'm appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
And Strawberry's two leading choices happen to be the Dodgers and the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk a whole lot about it right now," Strawberry said, "but Southern 
California is where I'd like to be, and I definitely want to stay in the 
National League. The main thing for me is to go to a place where there's a 
winning atmosphere. You don't want to go from a winning team to a loser. 
</P>
<P>
"And I know both of the teams (the Padres and Dodgers) are capable of 
accomplishing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have shown Strawberry and the Mets this season that they're 
certainly a much different ballclub against them than they are against the rest 
of the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres might own the worst record in the league against the East, with a 
22-38 record, but they've sure beaten up the Mets, winning six of eight games. 
The Mets (68-51) dropped to three games behind the division-leading Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the East, and the Padres (57-63) moved to within 11 games of the 
Cincinnati Reds, the closest they've been since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bruce Hurst (8-8) who once again carried the Padres. He pitched seven 
shutout innings, allowing just five hits, and has a 1.17 ERA over his past six 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some adjustments in my delivery," Hurst said, "and it's fun again." 
</P>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who re-injured his right hamstring and was 
removed him from the game after the fifth inning, didn't depart until after 
igniting the Padre offense with a triple in the second inning -- his first 
since June 30, 1989 -- and scoring on Benito Santiago's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tight before the game," Clark said, "and the triple, I had to extend on 
that one. When I scored, I felt it bite a little bit. It never really loosened 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Padres mustered all of the offense they needed when they got another 
run in the sixth inning on Roberto Alomar's first home run since July 4, 
another on Mike Pagliarulo's sacrifice fly in the seventh, and then hung on for 
dear life. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who were already robbed of a run in the sixth inning when center 
fielder Shawn Abner made a brilliant running grab of Strawberry's line drive 
before crashing into the fence, threatened again in the eighth when Hurst 
opened the inning by walking Mark Carreon and Dave Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch called upon Craig Lefferts, who has six saves 
against the Mets this season. He immediately induced Gregg Jefferies into 
hitting a routine ground ball to Alomar, who juggled the ball while trying to 
step on second base and dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
Carreon, however, could not stop his momentum while rounding third, and when he 
tried to plant, his knee gave way, and lay helpless on the ground while Alomar 
threw to Pagliarulo at third and made the tag. Carreon later was diagnosed with 
a torn anterior cruciate of his right knee, and will miss the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
His injury leaves the Mets knowing that if they indeed are to come back and win 
the division, they likely will have to ride the back of Strawberry, who's on 
pace to finish with the best year of his career. 
</P>
<P>
It's also why Strawberry, 28, sits atop this year's potential free-agent list, 
leaving Jack McKeon, the Padre vice president/baseball operations, drooling 
over a dream outfield of Joe Carter, Tony Gwynn and Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
The $20 million question is whether the Padres would be willing to shell out 
the money to acquire Strawberry. And it might take that much to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padre chairman, said it's premature to talk about potential free 
agents, and it's a violation of major-league rules to discuss another club's 
player. But sometime in September, when the Padres discuss the availability of 
free agents, such as right fielder Tom Brunanksy, third baseman Terry Pendleton 
and center fielder Willie McGee, the name of Darryl Eugene Strawberry surely 
will arise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once I'm out of New York, I'll put up even bigger numbers," said 
Strawberry, who has averaged 31 homers and 89 RBIs the past seven seasons. "But 
in New York, it seems like nothing I do is good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Hey, he never hit 40 homers here.' OK, but I hit 39 two years in a 
row (1987 and 1988). Come on, what's one more. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I leave New York, all the pressure, and all those little things that 
hammer at you each day, will go away." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, who was offered a three-year, $9.1 million contract extension this 
season, has broken off talks with the Mets. The next time they'll talk 
contract, he said, is after he files for free agency. He's seeking a five-year 
contract, and whoever wants him bad enough, will come up with the proper amount 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
"The five years is the big thing," Strawberry said. "I don't want to sign 
somewhere for three years, and then go looking around again. I want this to be 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything, I just want to be appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say, Strawberry hardly feels appreciated in New York, certainly not 
after Frank Cashen, Met general manager and chief operating officer, criticized 
him in a Aug. 12 television interview. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry was so riled by Cashen's comments that this past Friday he had a 
team meeting in which he promised his teammates that he would do everything he 
could to help him win the championship, but once the seasons ends, he may have 
to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to feel comfortable for once in my life," Strawberry said, "It'd 
be so nice to play baseball without a cloud hanging over my head. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what that would feel like?" 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although no one has said anything officially to Padre Manager Greg Riddoch, he 
fully anticipates that he will return as manager in 1991. The Padres have an 
option for Riddoch's managerial services at $160,000, and promised him that a 
decision will be made no later than Oct. 15. "I expect to be back," Riddoch 
said. "Well, let's put it this way, what are my choices? I want to be here. I 
really do. But that's up to Jack McKeon and our owneership. If I don't have the 
opportunity, I'd be disappointed in that that I didn't get to run the race with 
the leggings off." McKeon, however, already has given Riddoch a vote of 
confidence, and Padre chairman Tom Werner also has said that he is pleased with 
Riddoch's performance since taking over at the All-Star break. The offical 
announcement that Riddoch will be retained in 1991 is expected to be only a 
formality. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts, Padre third baseman/left fielder, was unable to play Monday 
because of the injury he sustained Sunday when Phillie third basman Charlie 
Hayes kicked him in groin area. "He told me he could play, but couldn't dive 
for anything," Riddoch said, "so I said we better put someone else in there." 
Roberts, who watched the replay of Hayes kicking him about 15 times before 
Monday's game, said he's still angry of Hayes' attempt to knock the ball out of 
his glove. "There's no need for that," Roberts said, "and I'm not going to 
forget it, either." . . . Padre shortstop Garry Templeton, who received a 
$25,000 bonus Monday for playing in his 110th game of the season, is expected 
to miss tonight's game with a sore back. Roberts is expected to take his place 
at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Padre center fielder Shawn Abner, visiting with Joe McIlvaine, Mets vice 
president/baseball operations, before the game, said: "Come on, fess up, you 
wished you drafted (Mark) McGwire before the game instead of me, don't you." 
McIlvaine could only laugh. The Mets selected Abner with the first pick in the 
1984 free agent draft; McGwire was drafted by the Oakland Athletics. Abner was 
traded to the Padres on Dec. 11, 1986 in the Kevin McReynolds trade. . . . 
Abner on his catch of Strawberry: "You can't worry about yourself. I couldn't 
hit worth a damn tonight, so I had to do something. I never looked at the 
fence. If I had, I probably would have missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Mark your calendars: The Padres' 1991 season opener is tentatively scheduled 
Tuesday, April 8, against the San Francisco Giants at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. They will play three games against the Giants, and then complete the 
week by traveling to Los Angeles on April 11 for a three-gam series against the 
Dodgers. . . . The Padres' victory marked the first time since May 28 that 
they've defeated a National League East team in the opening game of a series. . 
. . The Padres will play the second game of their three-game series against the 
Mets at 7:05 tonight with Ed Whitson (9-7) scheduled to face Ron Darling (5-7).

DOUBLE TROUBLE FOR OFFENSES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COLORADO'S MCGHEE AND WILLIAMS, OPPONENTS WHEN THEY PLAYED IN 
HIGH SCHOOL, MIGHT BE THE BEST LINEBACKERS IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Colorado's Kanavis McGhee knows what a sack is: "Pushing, rushing, turning, 
sweating, turning, ripping, clawing and scratching," he says. "All that hard 
work pays off when you finally get it." 
</P>
<P>
But to get a sack for Colorado, an outside linebacker has to do more than fight 
past a tackle or a tight end, elude a blocking back and get to the quarterback 
to drag him down before he throws. 
</P>
<P>
He also has to be the first to get there. Any dawdling, any delay, and the sack 
McGhee was after might belong to Alfred Williams, his teammate and roommate. 
</P>
<P>
They are probably the finest pair of college linebackers in the country, 
Williams and McGhee -- each at least 6 feet 5 and 230 pounds or more. Each is 
agile, fast and strong. 
</P>
<P>
Each has a chance to be the first player taken in the next NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and McGhee will be united as fifth-ranked Colorado tries to stop 
ninth-ranked Tennessee and the Volunteers' outstanding running back, Chuck 
Webb, when the teams open the college football season Sunday in the first 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They will be united this season, trying to drive the Buffaloes toward a 
national championship after last year's 11-0 regular-season record was spoiled 
by a loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But along the way, there will be subtle competition between them. Close as they 
are, they will be seeing one another at every turn, opponents in every race for 
every honor. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 6-6 and 230, is the favorite of the Sporting News for both the Butkus 
Award, given to the nation's top linebacker, and the Lombardi Award, given to 
the top lineman or linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, 6-5 and 250, is ranked second for the Butkus by the publication, and 
seventh for the Lombardi, for which McGhee was one of four finalists last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Both players thought about declaring for the NFL draft last year as juniors. 
Now, as they look forward to the 1991 draft, McGhee is rated the No. 1 prospect 
by Don Heinrich's Pro Preview. The same preview picks Williams second. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it can be difficult, knowing the person you have to compete with is 
on the same team you're on, playing against the same teams you play against," 
said Williams, who last season had 10 1/2 sacks, 14 quarterback hurries and 
five pass deflections. He was selected first-team All-American by United Press 
International and second team by Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a silent competition going on. We compete for sacks and tackles. . . . 
But whatever way they decide to do it. If it was between me and Kanavis, and he 
won it -- he's like my brother, he's been my roommate since I first came to 
campus -- I couldn't be any happier. He feels the same." 
</P>
<P>
The only concern is that there be enough tackles for each to get his share. 
Last year, with quarterback Darian Hagan and running back Eric Bieniemy 
spearheading an offense that averaged 41.1 points, the defense wasn't on the 
field very much. 
</P>
<P>
With a defense that gave up an average of 13.6 points, McGhee and Williams sat 
out six entire quarters because the games were blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope there are enough tackles for both of us," said McGhee, who had seven 
sacks, nine hurries and four pass break-ups last season and was selected 
second-team All-American by UPI. "We worried about that last year. It was 
enough to go around for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and McGhee were bumping elbows long before they arrived in Boulder. 
Both are from Houston, their homes perhaps 15 minutes apart. In high school, 
both played football and basketball, and both competed in track and field. At 
Jesse Jones High, Williams threw the discus, put the shot and high-jumped. 
McGhee did all of those and also ran some sprints for Wheatley High. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn, it seemed, they met. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I really noticed him was my freshman year, playing basketball," 
Williams said. "I was a freshman and he was a freshman. And as freshmen, some 
things just seem a little more extraordinary than others. 
</P>
<P>
"We were warming up for the game, and he dunked the basketball. He could dunk 
early on. All my teammates, said, like, 'He can do it. Why can't you?' That was 
the first time I really was aware who he was." 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't discover that they would be going to college together until 
late in their senior years, the last time their basketball teams played each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out right before the game, and he found out, too," Williams said. 
"That was the first time my varsity team beat him." 
</P>
<P>
They have been together since, both playing a lot as freshman and becoming 
starters as sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
When McGhee started last season slowly, still recovering from a broken ankle 
suffered against Nebraska the season before, Williams started quickly, with 2 
1/2 sacks against Texas in a season-opening 27-6 victory and two more the next 
week against Colorado State in a game the Buffaloes won, 45-20. 
</P>
<P>
He had one of his finest moments against Illinois in the third game, a 38-7 
victory. It was a flashy, spinning sack of Illini quarterback Jeff George, one 
of two Williams had that game. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee prospered later in the year, and although his sack numbers were not as 
flashy as Williams', he might be the better defender against the run. 
</P>
<P>
"Kanavis has the body type, and the strength, to be better against the run," 
said Bob Simmons, who coaches Colorado's outside linebackers. "He's 250, and 
can bench(-press) 400 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee is able to rush or drop back into pass coverage and is a hard-hitting 
tackler. Williams is taller, lighter and less bruising, but is faster and 
quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had one or two players like them, but never two at the same time of such 
ability, size and speed," Simmons said. "Yeah, I feel blessed." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents do not. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard guys making comments that they are aware where they are at all 
times," Simmons said. "When people make up their game plan and blocking 
schemes, you know they're paying attention to them." 
</P>
<P>
Williams knows that, and offers sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to think it's a difficult game plan if I was the offensive 
coordinator, knowing we could be coming every time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee knows it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If they come my way, I know I'm going to get them. If they go the other way, 
Alfred's going to get them. If they go up the middle, I have confidence in the 
middle of our line. I wonder what they're thinking. Which way can they go?"

WITH ONE SWING, SHARPERSON CUTS REDS' LEAD TO 5 1/2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
With bats, fists and a growing fury, the Dodgers slugged their way to within 5 
1/2 games of first place in the National League West Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dempsey knocked Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra out of the game when both 
players were ejected because of a bench-clearing incident in the seventh 
inning, then Mike Sharperson knocked a fastball over the left-field fence in 
the ninth innning to beat the Phillies, 2-1, before 28,112 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine what was more rare -- Dempsey's fight at home 
plate with the major league's leading hitter, or Sharperson's home run on a 
one-out, 2-and-0 pitch from the Phillies' Terry Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson's blast was the second of his career. It came only four days after 
he ended his homerless streak at 446 at-bats. That was the longest streak for 
any active player yet to hit a major league home run. 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson's home run moved the second-place Dodgers closer to first-place 
Cincinnati than they have been since May 7. The Reds lost Monday for the fifth 
time in a row, falling to the Chicago Cubs, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting a home run was the furthest thing in the back of my mind," Sharperson 
said. "I seldom hit the ball that hard here. I think I've only had a couple of 
homers here all year in batting practice." 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson said he was been inspired, however, since several members of the San 
Francisco Giants alerted him to a story in a national baseball magazine that 
listed him as the current homerless king. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the field a couple of weeks ago and I hear Kevin Mitchell and some guys 
calling me, 'The Zero Hero,' " Sharperson said. "I check it out and see that 
I've gone the longest without a career homer and so I say, 'Man, I'm getting 
that label off me right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
His second homer in his last 14 at-bats barely overshadowed an equally dramatic 
blow that resulted in the Dodgers losing a .202-hitter while the Phillies lost 
a .342-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost 150 points right there . . . that hurt," said Phillie Manager Nick 
Leyva after Dempsey and Dykstra were ejected with two out in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings earlier, with runners on first and third and two out, Dykstra had 
been called out on strikes on a pitch that grazed the outside corner. He said a 
few things to home plate substitute umpire Ron Barnes then, and continued his 
conversation as he stepped in the batter's box in the seventh against Dodger 
starter Mike Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
"He was still mad about the last pitch, he said it was 12 inches high and 12 
inches outside," Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation stopped for a second, then Dykstra stepped out of the batter's 
box and continued talking until Dempsey interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, he's hitting .340, what does he have to be mad about?" Dempsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra then yelled at Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I had been brown-nosing the umpires," Dempsey said. "He should not 
have involved me." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey calmly stood, took off his mask, and slugged Dykstra in the face with 
his catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not my best left," Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
He followed with a right to the midsection, but Dykstra blocked it and the 
players clenched and tumbled to the ground. Both benches cleared, the players 
piled on top of each other at home plate, and the game did not resume until 
eight minutes later, after both Dempsey and Dykstra were ejected. It was the 
second fight involving the Phillies in 11 days; on Aug. 9 they brawled with the 
New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was between me and him, it was one of those things," said Dykstra, who 
offered no further explanation. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the fight inspired the Dodgers, Manager Tom Lasorda, who was 
bumped to the ground in the incident, just smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen games affected before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson's homer gave reliever Jim Gott his first victory since Aug. 14, 1988 
at Philadelphia. Gott retired all six hitters he faced in relief of starter 
Morgan, extending his streak to 18 consecutive outs, and he has not allowed an 
earned run in his last 13 outings. 
</P>
<P>
"What a great time for us to be doing this," said Gott of the Dodgers, who have 
picked up eight games in the standings in a span of 28 games, since July 23. 
</P>
<P>
They have 41 games remaining, and the Reds have 42 left. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody around here is getting on a high," Gott added. "We know what we can 
do, and we are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had scored in the first inning on a grounder by Kal Daniels after 
singles by Jose Offerman and Stan Javier and a wild pitch by Mulholland. 
Offerman was making his second consecutive start in place of Alfredo Griffin, 
who so far is not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies countered six innings later against Morgan when Darren Daulton 
doubled to right field and eventually scored on a run-scoring single by Dale 
Murphy, who had two hits in 17 career at-bats against Morgan including two 
strikeouts earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin defused the growing shortstop controversy in a unique 
closed-door meeting. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, who promised Griffin Sunday 
that he would be rested only one day so phenom Jose Offerman could make his 
major league debut, summoned Griffin into his office before Monday's game. 
Considering Offerman had three hits Sunday, including a home run, Lasorda 
wanted to ask Griffin a favor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's your decision," the manager reportedly told Griffin, "but the kid had 
such a good game, would you consider sitting down one more day so he can have 
another chance?" Griffin replied yes, and Offerman made his second consecutive 
start. "I understand this game, I'm not selfish," Griffin said later. "I know 
I'm still the regular. The kid had a good game. Give him a chance." 
</P>
<P>
In his last start, the Phillies' Terry Mulholland had become baseball's eighth 
pitcher to throw a no-hitter this season in defeating the San Francisco Giants, 
6-0. However, precedent was not in Mulholland's favor. This season's previous 
seven no-hit pitchers all struggled in their next starts, going 2-4 with a 4.60 
earned-run average during that time. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher made only his sixth start of the season at third base in place 
of Lenny Harris, who is hitting .212 against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Searage said that a Magnetic Resonancy Imaging test on his left elbow 
Monday was inconclusive. He will wait two weeks before deciding whether to have 
surgery. Because the medial collateral ligament injury is located within the 
joint, Searage faces the prospect of reconstructive surgery, rather than 
arthroscopic surgery. "I just hope it's inflamed, I am thinking of surgery only 
as a last resort," said Searage, 35, who is facing the first serious injury of 
his 15-year pro career.

The San Diego Gulls now have five players under contract after Monday's 
announcement that they have signed defender Al Tuer and left wing Taylor Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Tuer, according to the team's announcement, is best known for having spent much 
of his career in the penalty box. Hall's best year was 1987 when he scored 33 
goals and had 41 assists in 71 games for Maine of the American Hockey League.

LITTLE MCAFEE, A WALK-ON, MAKES BIG MARK AT FULLERTON

Most freshman walk-ons who show potential are redshirted their first season, 
but it appears Cal State Fullerton's Dwayne McAfee, from Lincoln High School in 
San Diego, will be sporting a jersey of different colors -- blue and orange -- 
when the Titans open Sept. 1 against Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee, 5-foot-6, 160 pounds, has so impressed the Fullerton coaching staff 
that Coach Gene Murphy has scrapped his plans to redshirt him and will use him 
as a kickoff returner and, possibly, as a wide receiver and punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee made the most impressive play of Saturday's intra-squad scrimmage, 
catching a short pass, eluding several defenders and turning it into a 40-yard 
gain. He's extremely quick, has soft hands and is dangerous when he gets some 
running room. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an exciting little guy," offensive coordinator Bill Wentworth said. "We 
were going to redshirt him, but he has put himself in the picture to play." 
</P>
<P>
McAfee's quickness was obvious to Titan coaches in the first week of summer 
practice, when players wear shorts and T-shirts. Wentworth said he figured 
McAfee wouldn't look as good once he got into a helmet, shoulder pads and 
started hitting. 
</P>
<P>
But McAfee continued to impress coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a walk-on is ready to play as a freshman, it surprises you," 
Wentworth said. "But he's a tough kid, and the more pressure we put on him, the 
more he has come on." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

O'NEAL: LATE START WON'T HURT 
</P>

<P>
Linebacker Leslie O'Neal's presence Monday afternoon at Chargers training camp 
made a believer out of Coach Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal ended his holdout and signed a two-year contract to become the 78th 
player to sign with the Chargers. Only Junior Seau, San Diego's first-round 
draft pick, remains unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
But in the morning, when O'Neal was expected at practice and proved to be a 
no-show, Henning explained his absence as a supernatural experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a movie downtown called 'Ghost,' " Henning said. "So far, he's been 
one. We're all looking forward to seeing big Leslie. Funny, you wouldn't think 
we'd be interested in seeing a guy with a girl's name, but in this case. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, you're talking about a player who went to the 1989 Pro Bowl -- as 
a backup and in a new position -- in his first full season after a debilitating 
knee injury kept him out for 23 months and almost cut short his career. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal took a routine team physical in the morning, went through a two-hour 
afternoon practice, and joked that he hadn't gotten in 18 holes of golf before 
his first day back. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having to play catch-up, O'Neal said the late start actually will work 
in his favor by keeping him more focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be working hard for two weeks and then here comes the season," he said. 
"I won't get the soreness or pounding like you get the first couple of weeks, 
but it's a more expedient time. I can concentrate, and not be thinking about 
getting through training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said there's still enough time to prepare a 
defense that was built, in part, around O'Neal, but he would have started to 
squirm had O'Neal held out much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of it," Lynn said, "was that we were practicing those things 
without the benefit of having him here. Not only did his absence hurt in terms 
of him not getting the work that was necessary, it also slows down and retards 
the development of the guys that play next to him." 
</P>
<P>
Had he not shown when he did, O'Neal's role might have been temporarily 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have probably had to throw some of those tactical things out the 
window," Lynn said, "or at least reduce his involvement in them until we had a 
chance to get him back and he had a chance to get back his timing." 
</P>
<P>
And O'Neal wasn't immune to the grief reserved for the players who hold out 
because of salary disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little," O'Neal said. "But it all goes down when you start 
playing. It happened my rookie year. When you sit out a while everyone's 
looking at you so you have to come out and play tougher the first day. You try 
to get that respect back, because to a certain extent people lose respect 
because you're gone away or they don't see you every day." 
</P>
<P>
While Henning said he didn't see enough of O'Neal on his first day back and 
didn't know if he will start this Saturday against the 49ers, Lynn said he's 
still a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question who the starter is and what his position is," Lynn said. 
"It's just a matter of how soon he can get through the bumps and bruises and 
nicks that go with the first three days of carrying your pads. . . . and how 
fast his body will respond and get over the muscle soreness." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal sidestepped inquiries about his salary, said he didn't know how 
well-paid he is compared to his teammates, but said he was happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't as happy with base salary," O'Neal said, "but the good thing is I 
have a two-year deal. I get a chance to hone my skills for the next two years, 
and hopefully (General Manager Bobby) Beathard and this organization will stay 
intact and they can see what I can do on the field. It makes it easier the next 
time it comes around." 
</P>
<P>
What they reached, according to O'Neal, was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was them saying we'll give you a base salary and then you can achieve the 
other things what you want through incentives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said having spent four years with Lynn gives him a head start with the 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's the same skinny we had last year," O'Neal said. "Being with 
Ron Lynn the last four years really helps because there are subtle changes, but 
you have the basic scheme and you're adding bits and pieces."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: WRIGHT DUE BACK AFTER VISITING HIS ILL FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State running back T.C. Wright, who went to Phoenix Sunday to be with 
his ailing father, is supposed to be back in time for this morning's practice, 
SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said Wright's father has a malignant tumor on his gall bladder and 
will undergo surgery later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wright is a 5-foot-10 transfer from Mesa (Ariz.) Community College who earned 
the starting SDSU running back position coming out of spring practice. He was 
selected first team community college All-America at Mesa last year, when he 
rushed for 1,073 yards, caught 39 passes for 473 yards and averaged 29.5 yards 
per kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luginbill said he is giving the team the day off on Sunday, when the 
Aztecs had tentatively planned to scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too much," Luginbill said. "We needed a day off. They start school on 
Monday, and they need a day away. The coaches need a day away. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting in good work. We wanted to see how things progressed, and they 
have progressed to the point where we don't feel we need (a scrimmage Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said SDSU will scrimmage twice during summer camp -- Wednesday and 
next Wednesday. SCOTT MILLER

ROTHENBERG TRYING TO GET BECKENBAUER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, stepped up the 
federation's pursuit of Franz Beckenbauer Monday, saying he will offer the West 
German coach a job doing "anything and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg also dismissed as "silly" a letter sent from six former USSF 
officers to soccer's international governing body, FIFA, protesting what they 
say was FIFA's interference in the recent USSF elections. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said he will meet with Beckenbauer in Austria next month to discuss 
the possibility of the coach working with the USSF. Beckenbauer, however, was 
quoted by Agence-France Presse Sunday as saying he will not be coming to the 
United States in any soccer capacity for at least two years, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, who was elected as president last month, said he wants to meet with 
Beckenbauer personally. He said he is already planning to meet FIFA officials 
in Switzerland early next month and will make a side trip to talk with 
Beckenbauer. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said he has had preliminary discussions with Beckenbauer's 
representatives and is prepared to offer him virtually any job within the 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, who coached West Germany to the World Cup title last month, has 
been rumored to be taking a position with the USSF. 
</P>
<P>
The coach was quoted by Agence-France Press as saying: "I cannot do anything 
else in Germany with my title of world champion. I won't go to the United 
States to prepare for the World Cup before 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have also surfaced that Beckenbauer will soon take a coaching job in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the letter to FIFA, which Rothenberg termed "a rather feeble 
protest," little response is expected. According to Stephen Flamhaft, a 
Brooklyn attorney retained by the group of former USSF officers, FIFA has yet 
to respond to the letter sent Aug. 10 to FIFA's general secretary, Joseph 
Blatter. 
</P>
<P>
Flamhaft said Monday that the six former officers represented a much larger 
number of USSF members upset by events at the USSF elections Aug. 5 at Orlando, 
Fla., which led to the election of Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Flamhaft said that the letter asked FIFA to conduct an inquiry into allegations 
that FIFA officials actively campaigned for Rothenberg. He is not optimistic 
that FIFA will show any interest in investigating itself.

NEWSWIRE: CLIPPERS MAKE DEAL WITH KCOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to increase visibility, the Clippers announced Monday they have 
agreed to a lucrative five-year contract with KCOP (Channel 13) to televise at 
least 34 games a season starting with the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is worth more than $100,000 a game, a source close to negotiations 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket, which signed a 10-year contract with the Lakers in 1985, pays 
about $95,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers are in the final season of a five-year deal with KTLA (Channel 5). 
KTLA will air 25 games this season, an increase of about five games. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Steele, chief executive officer of the Sterling Corp., which owns the 
Clippers, said discussions to expand the number of televised games have been 
held. An NBA franchise can air up to 41 games on commercial television. ELLIOTT

<P>
DOUBTS INCREASE AS VALENZUELA FAILS TO CONTACT STEWARDS ABOUT ABSENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Mar stewards are trying to keep an open mind on Patrick Valenzuela, but his 
recent disappearing act is making that increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, the leading rider at Del Mar with 34 victories, was supposed to 
have contacted the stewards Monday about a Wednesday meeting and subsequent 
drug test. But Steward Dave Samuel said late Monday that he had not heard from 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"His agent (Bob Meldahl) said he'd call," Samuel said. "But we don't know what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who has not ridden since winning four races Friday, is being 
questioned about calling in sick at Pimlico Saturday. He was scheduled to ride 
Sunny Blossom in a $350,000 stakes race, but complained of a stomach virus and 
missed his eight mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel said that Valenzuela, who still has a 10-victory lead in the jockey 
race, should still be able to ride Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Presuming we're satisfied with his answers, he'll ride Wednesday," Samuel 
said. "We really feel he hasn't done anything." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Valenzuela tested positive for cocaine and was suspended for 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty days after suffering broken legs and a broken arm at Hollywood Park, 
jockey Chris McCarron is scheduled to ride in the fifth and sixth races 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scotty McClellan, McCarron's agent, said there is still a slight possibility, 
however, that doctors will not clear McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
"He was waiting on the X-rays (Monday night) just to make sure everything 
checked out OK," McClellan said. "But Chris feels great and he's ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
McClellan said he finds it hard to believe than his client is ready to ride 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the X-rays on the (left thigh bone) and I thought five or six months, 
easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McCarron's doctors were able to insert a screw in the center of the bone, 
allowing McCarron to put pressure on it and not let the leg atrophy. McCarron's 
right leg healed on its own. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan said his client will ride two horses each Thursday and Friday, then 
will take three or four mounts on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating on the better horses in the better races," McClellan said. 
"You have a better chance of getting hurt with cheaper races." 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Laffit Pincay was suspended for five racing days for his actions in 
Sunday's Del Mar Derby. While riding Tight Spot, stewards ruled that Pincay 
crossed over sharply after the start, causing interference. As a result, Tight 
Spot was dropped from first to 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension does not include certain designated races. Therefore, Pincay 
will be allowed to ride in Saturday's $300,000 Cabrillo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, trainer of Tight Spot, will file a protest against the ruling 
that gave Itsallgreektome the victory in the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was a day of upsets. Masai Chief, an 87-1 shot ridden by Christine 
Davenport, won the second race. The $177.40 payoff was the biggest at Del Mar 
since More Influence paid $212.40 on Aug. 22, 1974. The biggest payoff at Del 
Mar was $263.40 by Cipria in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth race, Gold Fleece, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, paid $41.80. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport's victory was her first of the meeting and marked her first time in 
the money. Last year at Del Mar, she rode two winners.

Airlines Will Meet to Discuss Fuel Costs: The world's major airlines will 
convene in Geneva next week to discuss whether to charge more because of higher 
fuel costs caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. The meeting, Aug. 29-31, was 
called by the International Air Transport Assn, a group of 191 scheduled 
airlines, to decide on a unified strategy as rising oil prices inflate fuel 
bills that make up 15% of operating costs. Crude oil is trading above $27 a 
barrel, compared to about $15 in June.

Construction Outlook Revised Down: Construction contracts will decline 7% this 
year, according to a McGraw-Hill Information Services Co. forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts in 1990 are expected to total $247.07 billion, compared to $266.96 
billion last year. The report also predicted that housing starts will tumble 
11% to 1.38 million units, commercial and manufacturing building will drop 16% 
and public works construction will decline 1%. However, George A. Christie, 
McGraw-Hill's chief economist, said the worst appears to be over. "Every 
decline has its limit," he said.

Mexico Auctions Its Largest Copper Mine: The apparent winning bidder for the 
bankrupt, government-owned Cananea mine was Grupo Industrial Minera de Mexico, 
with an offer of $475 million. 
</P>
<P>
The firm produces 57% of Mexico's copper. The only other bidder, a group headed 
by construction magnate Bernardo Quintana, complained that awarding the mine to 
Grupo Industrial Minera de Mexico would create a monopoly. The mine is in 
Sonora state about 12 miles south of the Arizona border.

Steel Can Recycling Increases: The recycling rate shot up more than 39% for 
beverage cans made from steel bodies and aluminum lids, the Steel Can Recycling 
Institute of Pittsburgh reported. More than 700 million cans have been recycled 
so far this year. Many beverage producers are converting to steel, said the 
institute, because they are easily sorted with magnets for recycling and can be 
reprocessed efficiently in steel mills.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A feeble attempt at a rally Monday didn't seem to restore any confidence to the 
stock market as investors are continuing to face the reality of being held 
hostage to the threat of a war in the Middle East, said Irving Katz, director 
of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, weak retail sales and a slowdown in housing starts and sales 
confirm investors' fears of a recession while the core inflation rate is 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
None of this was ignored by traders of the 64 San Diego stocks, as 19 dropped 
to new 1990 lows. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are many, but overall perceptions of the future of the companies 
have undergone a radical transformation. Belief that California real estate 
will go the way of the East Coast with its declining values caused new lows in 
Burnham Pacific Properties, HomeFed, BSD Bancorp, First National and Great 
American. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a drop in discretionary spending, which eventually affects 
earnings, produced new lows in Chart House Enterprises and Price Co. 
Defense-related issues making new lows included Humphrey Inc. and Maxwell 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Poor and disappointing earnings prospects caused new lows in Wahlco 
Environmental, Advanced Marketing Services and WD-40. 
</P>
<P>
Investor difficulty in understanding the merger of Intermark and Triton Group 
Ltd. caused both stocks to hit new lows. The shareholders meet on Aug. 30 to 
approve a swap whereby Triton shareholders will receive 1.4 shares of Intermark 
stock for each share they own. 
</P>
<P>
Recent new issues that fell to new lows included Gensia Pharmaceuticals and 
California Jaymar.

RENOVATED COURSE SEEKS SENIOR PGA; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: UNIDEN HOPES TO ATTRACT A TELEVISED TOURNAMENT TO ITS VALENCIA COURSE, 
BUT THE COMPETITION IS TOUGH.

H.A. (Bud) Tenerani looked out over the third hole at the Valencia Country Club 
in Santa Clarita. A 237-yard par 3 with water curving around the rear of the 
green and with sand bunkers to the left, the hole is a confounding one for even 
the most experienced golfers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of hole we hope the PGA will appreciate," said Tenerani, the 
country club's marketing director. "It's a true test of golf." 
</P>
<P>
Tenerani hopes the golf course's challenging holes will help it attract a 
senior Professional Golfers' Assn. tournament. But despite the high regard 
golfers have for the 7,105-yard course -- designed 25 years ago by Robert Trent 
Jones Sr., the dean of golf course architects -- Valencia's chances of gaining 
the status afforded to hosts of major tournaments are slim indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any room for any new tournaments," said Tim Crosby, director of 
communications and sponsor services for the Senior PGA Tour. The senior tour 
runs a popular series of tournaments for golfers age 50 or older, that often 
attract big-name pros such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino.

Why is snaring a senior tournament so important to Valencia? "The P.R. and 
exposure," Crosby said. "Exposure is what it's all about from their 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Hosting one of the PGA tournaments would put the Valencia Country Club on 
national television and boost its prestige considerably for the course's owner, 
Uniden Corp., a Japanese concern with about $700 million in sales that is best 
known for its cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Facing growing competition in its cellular phone business from Taiwan and 
Korea, Uniden decided several years ago to diversify. Valencia is its first 
venture into golf, but it plans to use the course as a stepping stone to the 
eventual ownership of several golf courses in the United States, Japan and the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Tanabe, Valencia Country Club's general manager, said Uniden sees the 
Valencia course as an opportunity to establish its golfing reputation 
nationwide. That's why, he said, "the reputation of this golf course is very 
important to us." And so would be the imprimatur of hosting a senior PGA 
tournament, Tenerani said. "It's a credential. It demonstrates you know what 
you're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uniden Corp. purchased the Valencia course in 1985 for about $6 million from 
Newhall Land &amp; Farming, a major real estate company that built the course 
in 1965 as the first piece in its master plan for the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
When Newhall owned the course, it was open to the public, and for two years 
after Uniden's acquisition, it continued as a public course. But in 1987, 
Uniden turned the course into a private country club. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, extensive renovations had begun, including the addition of a new, 
sleekly designed, 45,500-square-foot clubhouse, computerized irrigation system, 
concrete cart paths and expanded practice areas. All told, Uniden has spent 
about $25 million revamping the course. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, golf is something of a national mania and members of Japanese golf 
clubs sometimes pay $1 million or more to join. Uniden is one of several 
Japanese companies that have purchased golf courses in California in recent 
years. The prestigious Riviera Country Club, home of the Los Angeles Open, was 
purchased by Marukin Shoji Co. of Japan in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because Uniden has invested heavily in the Valencia golf course, it will be 
quite a while before it has a profit to show for its overall investment. Tanabe 
wouldn't discuss the country club's profits, although he did disclose that it 
takes in about $4.5 million in revenues annually. Tenerani acknowledged that 
"the profit picture would be down the road a bit because of the capital 
expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's stiff membership fees should help. Individual members pay $100,000 
to join, those who play only on weekdays pay initial fees of $30,000, and 
corporations pay $200,000. Monthly dues are $250 for regular members, $150 for 
weekday members and $500 for corporations. By comparison, the prestigious 
Bel-Air Country Club charges $100,000 for regular individual members and $350 
per month, while the Riviera costs $25,000 up front for individuals to join and 
$370 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Valencia Country Club will suffer if it doesn't get a major 
tournament. In fact, it has temporarily frozen membership at 374 and its 
waiting list has about 60 names on it. 
</P>
<P>
The 600-locker clubhouse was opened last September and contains a gourmet 
Japanese restaurant complete with sushi bar and Japanese-style grills. Though 
the restaurant is highly praised by many area residents ("It makes an elegant 
addition to the city," said Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jill Klajic), not all 
the locals are thrilled by the stark, modern look of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a spaceship landing," said Scott Newhall, the great-grandson of 
the founder of Newhall Land &amp; Farming. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly more important to prospective PGA tournament sponsors, however, is the 
Valencia area's lack of sufficient hotel space to house the spectators that 
would be drawn to a large event. So Uniden is also planning to build a hotel 
near the golf course, on land that it also purchased from Newhall Land &amp; 
Farming. Other hotels are in various stages of development by Newhall Land. 
</P>
<P>
While the focus during the past few years has been on the renovations, Tenerani 
said he's ready now to start a marketing push to attract a senior tournament. 
When PGA Tour officials come to the area in November for the Security Pacific 
Classic at Rancho Park and in March for a senior tournament sponsored by GTE at 
the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club, Tenerani hopes to solicit some interest 
in Valencia as a future tournament site. 
</P>
<P>
But Uniden faces an uphill battle in its quest to bring a senior tournament to 
Valencia. Alex Frankel, marketing director at the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country 
Club, said Ojai's landing of a senior tournament was "mostly just luck." GTE 
was looking for a new site for its tournament, he said, and Ojai happened to be 
in the right place at the right time with the right pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's timing might not be so auspicious. Crosby of the senior tour said 
both the sponsors of the Ojai and the Rancho Park tournaments have no plans to 
move and there's little likelihood that another tournament would be added in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia already hosts a few local tournaments, including an annual charity 
event sponsored by the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hosptial and another by the 
local Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But Tenerani said Valencia's goal will still be to attract a major event. "Our 
interest is to let the PGA and the senior PGA people know we exist and have a 
facility that conceivably could qualify," he said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: BISHOP INC. REPORTS LOSS OF $511,000 IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Inc., an Agoura Hills supplier of engineering and architectural design 
products, reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $511,000, compared with a 
year-earlier loss of $330,000. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss came on a slight drop in Bishop's revenue in the quarter that 
ended June 30, to $2.37 million from $2.44 million. Bishop said it had expected 
its losses to increase because the company has been restructuring its 
operations to compete more effectively, but that it expects to cut the losses 
beginning in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Bishop lost $872,000 compared 
with a $393,000 loss a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue fell to $7.32 
million from $7.53 million.

IS EMBARGO ENOUGH TO STOP SADDAM?

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a giant anaconda slowly and relentlessly squeezing its prey, the world's 
most sweeping international embargo is tightening its grip around Iraq. "The 
countdown has begun," a senior U.S. official says confidently. "It's just a 
matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the outside world may have to wait longer than many analysts expect for the 
blockade to squeeze the last breath of resistance from Baghdad -- provided the 
rising level of rhetoric and the frustration over the foreign captives don't 
flare into conflict first. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other oil-rich Persian Gulf nations, Iraq has placed its highest 
priority on developing a more independent agricultural and industrial base. But 
it still imports goods large and small from around the world -- cotton, 
medicine and razor blades from Egypt, beef from Argentina, dairy products from 
Ireland, grain from the United States and Australia, fresh produce and cooking 
oil from Turkey, cars, steel and television sets from Japan, and everything 
from matches to warplanes from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's most vulnerable side is its dependence on food imports: A full 80% 
of everything that Iraqis eat comes from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
And, besides the pressure to replenish stocks of bullets and ballistic 
missiles, Iraq's biggest challenge in the face of the Western sanctions will be 
to fill the stomachs of more than 17 million Iraqis, tens of thousands of 
foreign workers and captives who are trapped in Baghdad, and the million-plus 
residents and foreigners in Kuwait, U.S. and private analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most optimistic estimates give Iraq two to six months of survival on 
its current food reserves. First will come the shortages. Then, rationing. And 
finally -- over the long term -- could come actual starvation. 
</P>
<P>
But the impact is likely to be uneven. U.S. estimates show that Baghdad had a 
115-day stockpile of rice in July, but only a nine-day supply of corn, which is 
mainly needed to feed livestock. The country's sugar stocks should last only 
about 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
The slow strangulation is already being felt. In a dramatic acknowledgment of 
the embargo's impact, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week publicly 
appealed for his countrymen to eat less. Baghdad bakeries have stopped making 
pastries. And despite threats of severe punishment for hoarders, stores in the 
Iraqi capital were mobbed last weekend as panicked shoppers rushed to buy up 
huge sacks of flour, sugar and other basic goods. In occupied Kuwait, the bread 
lines are four hours long. 
</P>
<P>
How long Hussein can survive politically as conditions deteriorate also may 
defy the odds, according to the limited Western intelligence available. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the opposition is abroad, in prison or in the ground," a U.S. analyst 
concedes. While Iraq's restive Kurds in the north and its Shiite majority in 
the south have long been hotbeds of dissent, the only two groups strong enough 
to mount an effective challenge to Hussein are the Revolutionary Command 
Council and the military, which have served as his power bases since he became 
Iraq's president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's implicit strategy has banked on the worsening 
economic squeeze to foment enough opposition inside Iraq to bring on the 
overthrow of Hussein -- prompting Iraq to retreat from Kuwait and eliminating 
the threat of future Iraqi adventurism. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, U.S. officials were ecstatic about how quickly the embargo began to 
take hold. America's allies cooperated in deploying a multinational fleet 
almost immediately. And Turkey and Saudi Arabia lost no time in closing the 
Iraqi oil pipelines in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
But Riad Ajami, professor of international management at Ohio State University 
and author of a new report on the Iraqi economy, asserts that for all the 
Western efforts, Iraq may not begin to feel any real pain for 45 to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that Iraqis are relatively well fed. The average Iraqi 
eats 3,000 calories a day -- a very high rate of food consumption compared to 
Third World countries. "Iraqis don't begin at the level of Bangladeshis or 
Mozambicans," an Administration economist says. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that how long the initial period of shortages lasts will depend on 
three factors -- the amount of goods that Iraq has stockpiled, the size of the 
country's next harvest and the amount of storage capacity that will be 
available for foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's evidence that this (Iraqi invasion of Kuwait) was planned months 
ahead," says William B. Quandt, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution 
who was a National Security Council staff member during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration. "Saddam (as Hussein is widely known in the Middle East) has 
been able to plan for things for some time, and he must have anticipated at 
least a partial embargo." 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been spending almost $2 billion a year just for food imports -- 
four times the value of its food exports. And virtually everything it buys is 
essential: wheat, rice, flour, sugar, milk, eggs, beef, chicken and livestock 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
With the current harvest season just beginning, Baghdad may be able to offset 
the impact of the embargo in the short run, a Turkish Foreign Ministry official 
says. Iraq has the most arable land in the Arab world -- about 20% of a country 
that occupies 168,000 square miles, an area slightly larger than California. 
About 70% of Iraq's arable land is currently being cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has limited storage facilities, such as grain elevators, and building 
a long-term reserve would be difficult, according to Samir Milady, an Egyptian 
expert on international food policy. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Hussein is likely to put off full-scale rationing of basic 
necessities until the last possible moment, if only because it opens the way 
for would-be political opponents. And Iraq may have bought itself an additional 
five to six months by reportedly looting $5 billion in gold and cash from 
Kuwait's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest unknowns are the amounts of food and other necessities that may be 
brought in by Turkish smugglers, or transshipped through Jordan, or trucked in 
from as far as the illegal "pirate" ports of Lebanon. "No embargo in history 
has been 100% successful," Ajami points out. "Market prices can make strange 
bedfellows." 
</P>
<P>
But Ajami says Iraq's money may not go very far. "The prices of all these goods 
will quadruple before they get to Baghdad," he says, "and the psychology of 
sanctions will begin to be felt long before that, undermining the confidence of 
people in Saddam's ability to run the economy and the state." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, experts say that the first signs of malnutrition could be seen in 
Baghdad within four months. If this occurs, the situation could get desperate 
by early next year. "That's when people will begin to slaughter animals and 
resort to what all people do in desperation: eat what they haven't eaten 
before," Ajami says. "That's also when the shortages will be so acute that the 
world will see images that will make everyone uncomfortable about starvation 
and children with inadequate diets." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede that Hussein may eventually be able to buy more time by 
appealing to the single loophole in the U.N. resolution that imposed the 
embargo -- an exemption for humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
"There is potential for serious disagreement on the prohibition of foodstuffs 
for humanitarian purposes," says a U.S. official monitoring the embargo. "At 
the moment, we're applying the embargo strictly (because) there's no indication 
that Iraq needs food. But if starvation sets in, it'll certainly play to the 
court of world public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department strategist agrees. "If we see pictures of Americans in Iraq 
and Kuwait suffering like everyone else, I wonder how popular sanctions will 
be," he muses. Yemen and Brazil have already said they will consider sending 
food on humanitarian grounds to prevent starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the current embargo has far more potential to succeed than any 
previous international boycott, for one reason: It has the endorsement -- and 
full participation -- of both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of imports from both countries will hurt Iraq severely. Since 
diplomatic relations were resumed in 1984 after a 17-year break, the United 
States has gradually become Iraq's leading supplier of food, accounting for 
about a third of Iraqi imports and providing virtually all the country's rice, 
corn, animal feed and vegetable oils. In 1988, U.S.-Iraqi trade totaled $2.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, historically a close political and military ally of Iraq, has 
been the major supplier of the country's technology, machinery, oil-extraction 
equipment and arms. During the first nine months of last year, Soviet-Iraqi 
trade totaled $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the embargo comes at a time when Iraqis already have had to tighten 
their belts as a result of Hussein's eight-year war with neighboring Iran. A 
decade ago, on the eve of its invasion of Iran, Baghdad had amassed a 
$40-billion surplus in foreign exchange. But like water in the desert sands, 
the funds quickly evaporated as Hussein poured out billions to maintain his 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Hussein misjudged the Western reaction to his invasion of Kuwait last 
month, he underestimated the cost of the war with Iran in 1980. Hussein thought 
the military foray would be quick and dirty. But the tenacious Iranians fought 
back, and within two years the conflict was costing him $1.5 billion a month. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil exports plummeted then, too -- by as much as 80% -- because a 
pipeline to the Mediterranean through Syria was cut off and its sole outlet to 
the sea was hostage to the war. 
</P>
<P>
As the supply of basic foodstuffs began to dry up, Hussein warned that Iraqis 
would have to absorb new economic hardships through "rationalization" and an 
end to all "non-essential spending." His regime was in such dire financial 
straits that he urged Iraqis to turn in their gold jewelry and heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Iraqi television showed footage of women donating gold bracelets, 
necklaces and rings, which together brought in 50 tons of gold worth more than 
$600 million, according to the Baghdad press. Even Hussein's wife contributed 
her personal valuables to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Iraq's misadventure in Iran and the subsequent drive to rebuild the 
country has left Baghdad with a debt of between $80 billion and $100 billion -- 
half of it owed to gulf neighbors and half to European institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some analysts believe that Hussein's economic plight may have played a 
role in precipitating the current gulf crisis. "The debt and the credit squeeze 
were as much responsible for Iraq's decision to invade Kuwait as the historic 
territorial claims," says a congressional staffer who specializes in the Middle 
East. "(Hussein) needed the money more than the land." 
</P>
<P>
Still, today's waiting game may not be all in the West's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq can probably survive two or three months before the brunt hits the public 
too badly, but we will also get tired of this (standoff) before long," Quandt 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
Some even believe that Hussein may ultimately prove better able to stay the 
course than President Bush. "Saddam can hold out longer than American public 
opinion in keeping a huge force in Saudi Arabia," says Ken Katzman, a former 
CIA analyst now at Defense Systems Inc., a Washington consulting firm. "He's 
confronted long odds for a long time and always survived. If we look to 
sanctions to destroy him, then we're looking under the wrong rock. Sanctions 
are not the way to rattle his cage. He only understands force, violence and 
military strength. That's what it will take to fundamentally change his view of 
the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Although Administration strategists are hoping for an Iraqi version of the 
recent revolutions in Eastern Europe to rid the region of the "Saddam problem," 
they concede there are no Vaclav Havels or Lech Walesas waiting in the 
background to challenge Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, who account for 15% of Iraq's population, have been a constant 
irritation to the regime. With help from foreign intelligence agencies -- the 
CIA, Israel's Mossad and pre-revolutionary Iran's SAVAK -- Kurdish guerrillas 
mounted a potent, though ultimately unsuccessful, insurgency in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Kurdish guerrillas, however, continued small-scale attacks on their own in 
their northeast strongholds. By 1987, the unrest so angered Hussein that he 
blew up 500 Kurdish villages and relocated up to a half-million Kurds. In the 
spring of 1988, his forces used nerve and poison gases in the village of 
Halabja against Kurds who had supported Iran in the war, killing about 5,000 of 
them. Since then, he has created a virtual cordon sanitaire around the region. 
</P>
<P>
In talks in Washington this past week, Jalal Talabani of the Kurdish Democratic 
Party pledged support to Kuwait's ruling Al Sabah family in its fight to regain 
control of the tiny city-state. Kuwaiti officials-in-exile say the Kurds will 
again try to mount new attacks in the north to divert Iraq's troops now massed 
along the southern borders with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential hotbed is Iraq's Shiite community, which accounts for 60% of 
the population. Again, however, Hussein has ruthlessly tamed opposition. After 
the 1979 revolution in predominantly Shiite Iran, Hussein executed Iraq's 
leading radical Shiite cleric, Mohammed Bakr Sadr, and deported an estimated 
200,000 Iraqi Shiites of Iranian origin across the border into Iran. The 
remnants of the group Al Dawa -- Arabic for "The Call," which Sadr headed -- 
are now headquartered in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appealed to the Iraqi Shiites to side 
with their brethren in Iran and to rise up against Hussein, the majority were 
loyal to Iraq instead. Indeed, the majority of troops in the Iraqi army are 
Shiite, mostly in low-ranking positions. Nationalism has had more appeal than 
religious roots. 
</P>
<P>
But tiny cores of resistance did surface: In September, 1987, a small cell of 
Al Dawa operatives opened fire during a parade to celebrate the annual Army Day 
in Baquba, just north of Baghdad. Although troops returned fire, at least 50 
were killed, according to foreign envoys, who were among the dignitaries 
invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
According to European envoys, however, Western intelligence is not looking to 
the Shiite community as the primary challenge to the strong-arm rule of the 
Takriti clan, from which Hussein comes and members of which permeate the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves two bodies: the military and the Revolutionary Command Council that 
serves as Hussein's inner circle. As yet, however, foreign envoys cannot 
identify viable individuals or cells within either that would be capable of 
taking over. "Sanctions will eventually squeeze Iraq very hard, but that will 
not necessarily lead an army officer to bump him off," Quandt says. 
</P>
<P>
Ajami agrees. "(Hussein's) intelligence capability prevails in all segments 
within the military," he says. "It would be hard for him not to find out about 
any movement against him. There's also no guarantee that a group of young 
officers would be any more compromising than Saddam. Iraq could end up with an 
even worse monster." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's abrupt peace offer to Iran last week could lead to dissent within 
some military quarters angered by the enormous financial and personnel losses 
suffered during that eight-year conflict. At the same time, however, the Iraqi 
leader's appeal to the Arab world to rise up against foreign military 
intervention and political domination -- to prevent Arab resources from being 
diverted to Western coffers -- appears to have growing appeal, not only in 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. analysts argue that Hussein is eventually doomed. "He's finished -- 
period," the congressional expert says. "If he goes forward, he faces defeat 
and overthrow. If he goes back, there will be a lot of questions about why this 
took place at all, especially after his peace with Iran on Iranian terms. And 
if he stays put, he'll be strangled economically." 
</P>
<P>
But most analysts are also unable to come up with a workable scenario for 
Hussein's overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Three factors -- the prospect of a prolonged stalemate as the embargo slowly 
squeezes, the absence of visible domestic opposition and the escalating tension 
over American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait -- have led a growing number of U.S. 
experts to predict that foreign military force will be the only short-term 
means of removing the "Saddam problem" from the Middle East political equation. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, it is a test of wills -- and time.

But There Are Risks for Bush, Too 
</P>
<P>
* Detention of 3,000 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait could evolve into the biggest 
hostage crisis yet for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* There may be terrorist attacks by Islamic militants anxious to punish America 
for intervening. 
</P>
<P>
* The economic fallout from the intervention could tip America into recession. 
</P>
<P>
* Intervention may trigger such a popular backlash in the region that it 
undermines the very moderate Arab regimes it was meant to aid. 
</P>
<P>
* Failure to make Hussein back down could severely damage American credibility, 
inspiring an even worse regional arms race as regimes decide they can no longer 
count on either superpower for protection. 
</P>
<P>
* Rather than the world's policeman, the United States could come to be seen as 
the world's cowboy, slowing the evolution to a post-Cold War order. 
</P>
<P>
* There could be an Iraqi attack against U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Noose Around Iraq 
</P>
<P>
* Syria, an old and bitter rival, sends troops to Saudi Arabia and reinforces 
its border; 
</P>
<P>
* Turkey cuts off one of Iraq's main oil pipelines and joins in U.N. economic 
sanctions; 
</P>
<P>
* A hostile Kurdish minority in northern Iraq pledges support for Kuwait and 
waits for Saddam to slip; 
</P>
<P>
* Iran welcomes Iraqi peace overtures but demands a withdrawal from Kuwait and 
nurses the bitter wounds of a long war; 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf threaten to halt sea shipments into or out 
of Iraq; 
</P>
<P>
* Saudi Arabia, bolstered by tens of thousands of U.S., Egyptian, and other 
troops, cuts Iraq's other main oil pipeline; 
</P>
<P>
* Jordan tries to walk a tightrope between its moderate Arab and Western 
benefactors on one side and its neighbor, Iraq, on the other.

JAPANESE PUBLIC BATHS MAY SOON BE WASHED UP; 
</P>
<P>
THE HOME TUB HAS PUT A BIG DENT IN ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ENDURING 
INSTITUTIONS.

TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old temple-shaped building with its sweeping tile roof is gone from the 
capital's Shirogane district now, torn down and replaced by a Western-style, 
multi-story structure that also houses apartments, a coffee shop and a 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
The Horaiyu public bathhouse is still there -- it's just a little tougher to 
spot now that it's limited to the subbasement, beneath the coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed inside the bathhouse, or "sento," too. (The word, 
literally, means "cash for hot water.") 
</P>
<P>
There's no more free soap, for example. A customer has to bring his own, or buy 
it from one of the vending machines that also dispense towels, razors and 
underwear. Instead of the old plastic baskets, there are now rows of lockers 
for storing clothes. And a bather can now wash his laundry in one of the 
coin-operated machines that are provided while he is washing himself in the 
tiled bathing area. 
</P>
<P>
There are only enough water spigots for 26 bathers at a time now -- less than 
half what the spacious old bathhouse offered. But there is a separate waiting 
room complete with television. And in another concession to modernity, the 
cashier now sits in the waiting room also, instead of in the more traditional 
perch atop a dais, with a view of both the men's and women's sections of the 
baths. 
</P>
<P>
"The cashier used to be a special characteristic of a sento," said Shigeki 
Fujita, adviser to the Tokyo Public Bathing Environment Sanitary Enterprise 
Union, a guild of bathhouse owners. "He or she would greet the customers and 
exchange a few pleasantries. It created an atmosphere of warmth and 
friendliness. But young people don't like to be looked at (naked)." 
</P>
<P>
As Fujita's comments and the scene at the Horaiyu suggests, times are changing 
for one of Japan's more enduring institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago more than half the people who live in Tokyo patronized its 
public bathhouses, which first sprang up in the 16th Century. A traditional 
Japanese love of bathing and a penchant for cleanliness helped business. 
Bathing remains a favorite national pastime, particularly at the more than 
1,000 "onsen" (hot springs) resorts where aficionados indulge themselves two 
and three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, business is now on a steady decline, with many owners struggling 
to stay afloat despite government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
There is more competition from "coin shower" shops offering a three-minute 
dousing for 100 yen (67 cents) compared with the standard 310 yen ($2.06) adult 
price for a visit to a bathhouse. The shower shops also offer private booths 
and are open 24 hours a day compared with the eight-hours-a-day sento. 
</P>
<P>
Most devastating, however, has been something much more basic: the spread of 
the home bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
When the number of bathhouses in Tokyo peaked at 2,687 in December, 1968, about 
half of the living units in Tokyo had no bathtub. Now, 83% of the capital's 
housing is equipped with baths. 
</P>
<P>
Only 452,000 of the city's 11.9 million residents now use the public baths on 
an average day compared with nearly 1.1 million who used them daily as recently 
as 1975. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of sento in the capital had dwindled to 
1,978. Sixty-five more have disappeared just since the beginning of this year, 
Fujita said, and he predicted that the number will continue to dwindle down to 
about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
There remain public bathhouses in even some of Tokyo's wealthiest sections. 
Chiyoda Ward, where most major banks are located, is home to seven sento, for 
example. And Minato Ward, a high-rent district favored by the foreign business 
community, hosts 18. 
</P>
<P>
But Fujita said that even to retain 1,500 bathhouses in the capital will 
require operators to start providing new "value-added" services to attract more 
customers who have baths at home. At present, such customers account for about 
one-fourth of the people who use bathhouses, but they come only once a week, 
according to Fujita. 
</P>
<P>
Labor costs long ago wiped out such bathhouse luxuries as "sansuke" -- men who 
would wash men's or women's backs as well as women's hair. At Horaiyu, gone 
also are the women attendants who used to roam around the men's dressing room 
putting things in order -- much to the embarrassment of first-time visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was the old tradition that bathhouses serve as social centers for 
conversation evident at Horaiyu during a recent visit. No one spoke a word. 
Most of the customers were in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Bathers sat on tiny, 5-inch-tall stools, soaping themselves in front of 
individual mirrors and sets of hot and cold water spigots. Each had a plastic 
bucket available for rinsing. Small drainage canals in the floor carry away 
suds and water. 
</P>
<P>
The custom is to wash first, then relax in one of two tiled pools of hot water 
(a minimum of 108 degrees Fahrenheit by government regulation) -- although many 
bathers seem to do it the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
Horaiyu now offers a Jacuzzi-style bubbling pool in addition to its plain pool. 
Some of Tokyo's other renovated sento have installed as many as seven different 
kinds of pools, including an "electric bath" said to feature a low-voltage 
current which presumably relieves stress at some level short of electrocution. 
And some bathhouses have added saunas and athletic workout areas. 
</P>
<P>
As a welfare measure, the Tokyo government is spending nearly $11 million this 
year to support sento, including interest subsidies for remodeling and to 
supplement promotional measures adopted by the national government's Health and 
Welfare Ministry. The ministry provides free bath tickets for welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Still, said Ryuji Ichiko, who is in charge of supervising bathhouses for the 
Tokyo government's Livelihood and Cultural Affairs Division, "running a 
bathhouse is the worst business in Japan." With an average of 215 customers a 
day, daily revenue amounts to only $400 at government-regulated prices, he 
said. Noodle shops do better. 
</P>
<P>
"No new entrepreneur has entered the business in the last 10 years," Ichiko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a bathhouse operator seeks advice from (a consultant), the conclusion 
is 'go out of business,' " added sento owners' guild adviser Fujita. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's bathhouse owners comprise a close-knit club. Nearly all are descended 
from the second and third sons of rice farmers in three rural prefectures 
(states) -- Niigata, Ishikawa, and Toyama. Prior to the post-World War II U.S. 
occupation of Japan, only the eldest son could inherit his father's land, and 
after the first of these disinherited younger sons made a go of it in the Tokyo 
bathhouse business, their friends followed. 
</P>
<P>
"Having worked on farms, they were used to manual labor. And running a 
bathhouse doesn't require much of a business mind. You don't need technology. 
You just provide water and heat it. Even someone with only an elementary school 
education can do this kind of business," Fujita said. 
</P>
<P>
The descendants of those sento entrepreneurs remain bound by communal relations 
which make them reluctant to give up the business despite the hard times. 
</P>
<P>
They know that if they quit they will be leaving their "group," said Motoaki 
Takahashi, a third-generation bathhouse owner, and along with it, the bond of 
regional ties, friendship and mutual help which attracted their fathers and 
grandfathers into the business in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being conservative and unwilling to try their hand at any new 
business, these bathhouse owners also tend to be sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
Facing annual losses of nearly $25,000, Takahashi said he considered going of 
out business two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought of our customers coming to our bathhouse from long distances no 
matter how cold it is in winter or how hot it is in summer. Some people ride a 
bicycle 20 minutes. There is one old lady who comes by taxi, spending about 
100,000 yen ($667) a month, because there is no bathhouse in her neighborhood," 
Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Takahashi recalled, "the daughter of one of my regular customers came 
in with her new-born baby. She told me that her mother had brought her to our 
bathhouse when she was a baby, and now she was bringing her baby, too. Three 
generations of her family have been using our bathhouse," Takahashi said. "That 
was too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
Takahashi made up his mind to keep the bathhouse open as long as his regular 
customers -- his friends -- continued coming, he said. Above his remodelled 
sento are two floors of offices, the rent from which more than covers his 
bathhouse losses. 
</P>
<P>
Bathhouse owners, however, face problems that may yet overwhelm their community 
spirit. Entrepreneurs who rent their premises -- 37% of the total -- almost 
certainly will be forced out of business when their leases expire and they face 
renewal fees of as much as $400,000, Fujita predicted. Many who inherit 
bathhouses on owned land that has skyrocketed in value will be forced to sell 
out to pay inheritance taxes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the current bathhouse proprietors are carrying on the business because 
it was passed down to them by their ancestors. But it's doubtful whether their 
successors will continue the business," said Ichiko of the Tokyo government.

After sticking it out through years of mediocre-to-bad U.S.-Soviet trade 
relations, IBM can finally afford to do business its own way, according to the 
head of its Moscow office, Burt Polishook. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the world, IBM uses community projects to market its products and 
hires only local nationals, Polishook explained. "IBM is known for being a 
citizen of the community in all the big cities of the world. But the ability to 
do community projects depends on the financial shape of the IBM office." 
</P>
<P>
And even though the company has been represented here for 18 years, it wasn't 
until late last year that the Soviet office generated enough business for IBM 
to use those same techniques here. 
</P>
<P>
Polishook refused to talk in figures or percentages about the growth of IBM's 
business in the Soviet Union, but he made it clear that the goods his company 
has to offer are in huge demand. 
</P>
<P>
"This country is computer starved," he exclaimed. "Business is clearly getting 
better each year." 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration of how the company's community service projects work, 
consider its program, several months old, of supplying computers and know-how 
for workshops on computer use for the disabled and in public schools. At its 
own expense, IBM also sent 18 Soviet computer professors to IBM's European 
education center in Belgium to train them in the IBM way of teaching computer 
science to schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"The reception has been extremely positive, and we did get a contract out of 
it," Polishook said. The Soviet Education Ministry signed a contract with IBM 
this spring to supply 13,000 computers to secondary schools across the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the contract because we showed that we understand the use of computers 
in education, and we demonstrated our capability to support the computers, not 
just sell them and walk away," Polishook said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four months, IBM has also started recruiting Soviet computer 
specialists to help out with marketing and servicing its products. So far, the 
company has lined up agents in Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Dnepropetrovsk and 
elsewhere. These agents are the first step toward staffing IBM's Soviet 
operations exclusively with Soviet nationals, following its pattern nearly 
everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
None of this would have been possible without an improvement in superpower 
relations, Polishook said. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, IBM was limited to selling small computers to Soviet clients 
because of restrictions set by the 17-member, U.S.-led Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. But last month Cocom significantly 
eased its rules, and now IBM can market its main-frame computers to Soviet 
clients for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see is great interest in the large systems from government ministries, 
institutes and joint ventures," said Polishook, nattily attired in a navy-blue 
suit. "Business is better because we can offer more and because they want 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Superpower economic relations were generally lukewarm at best even during the 
detente years of the 1970s. Then-President Jimmy Carter ordered a virtual trade 
freeze after the Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in 1979. IBM 
director and chairman emeritus Thomas Watson Jr. was U.S. ambassador in Moscow 
during that difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
"After Afghanistan, I don't think we could sell anything," Polishook said. But, 
he added, IBM is now profiting from its decision to tough it out in Moscow 
during those hard times. 
</P>
<P>
"It really helps us," the executive said. "We have a customer base, we know how 
to do business here and we're still willing to be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demand for computers, IBM, like most foreign firms, is limited in 
its sales to Soviet businesses because they lack freely convertible currencies 
like dollars or yen. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, for example, IBM refused to sell computers for anything but 
freely convertible currencies -- a policy meaning that, like most foreign 
firms, IBM's sales were limited by the Kremlin's hard currency shortage. It's 
still a problem, but now IBM is also bartering with Soviet clients. 
</P>
<P>
Many foreign computer firms are competing for the Soviet market, but Polishook 
said IBM is ahead of the pack because of its name recognition. Even Soviet 
computers and software are designed to be IBM compatible. 
</P>
<P>
Polishook said the elements are in place for a real turnaround in the Soviet 
economic system. "The future has never looked better here," he said. "Both the 
desire for change and the understanding of what needs to change are here. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take years for it to happen. You have to think of it as a point in 
history. If you see where they've come from and in what time frame they've done 
it, then you realize the right things have been happening." 
</P>
<P>
American businesses, he said, can be part of the change. 
</P>
<P>
"If you start out knowing business here is not what it is in New York or Paris, 
and you're committed to helping change the system -- then you're part of the 
solution," he said.

THE GULF CRISIS: FINDING FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editorial comment from around the world reveals some sharply differing 
perspectives on the current confrontation in the Persian Gulf. The Saudi press 
may be vitriolic in its condemnation of Saddam Hussein, for example, but a 
major Palestinian weekly published in East Jerusalem puts the blame for the 
crisis squarely on the United States. The Japanese press is proud that its 
government acted more boldly than usual in declaring an Iraqi oil boycott, but 
France's Le Monde reflects concern that Washington may be about to drag its 
allies deeper into crisis than they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Japanese decisions to impose economic sanctions in the past were 
delayed, because the Japanese government lacks autonomy or independence in its 
diplomacy. As a result, Japan usually makes its decision after seeing what 
Europe and America intend to do. However, it should be highly evaluated that 
Japan has made the decision comparatively quickly this time . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this, even if sacrifices must be made, we must abide by 
international opinion with simple honesty. That is the path that Japan, which 
until now been evaluated only for its economic power, should seek."

"Saddam got it wrong when his smash-and-grab raid on Iran dragged on for nearly 
a decade. He got it wrong again when he discounted world reaction to his 
invasion of Kuwait this month. But he hung on against an enemy three times 
larger for eight years without defeat; he still holds Kuwait, from which his 
enemies cannot evict him without ruining what they want to save, and there can 
be no denying that he has the capacity to surprise us all. To say he is just 
feeling vulnerable and lonely is to make the same kind of mistake as those who 
claim all bullies are cowards. Saddam Hussein should not be underestimated or 
written off -- a warning that the Iranians probably need rather less than 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Guardian (London) 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam is not crazy, for if he were, he would not have achieved the military 
success he has done so far. He is a shrewd, cold-blooded megalomaniac, 
carefully considering every move he makes. But that is not what concerns the 
world. Even that can be dealt with. His ridiculous propaganda against the 
kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country that clothed and fed his people, supported 
them when they were under attack, poured millions of dollars daily to support 
their causes, can be put down to his own desperation and treachery. How could a 
man who shot 21 of his own Cabinet ministers have serious intentions in the 
spread of Islam? What sort of leader who turns a blind eye to the raping, 
looting and killing going on in a fellow Muslim country could gain the smallest 
modicum of trust from other Muslims? All his rantings are a mere comedy; the 
blackest comedy of the century. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, he is a fool, squirming and frothing hysteria in a trench of his 
own making. All he can do now is spread dissension, threaten havoc and look for 
his own survival, politically and personally. 'The Father-Leader' is nothing 
more than a fool and a common thug; a man with a common mortal destiny he will 
one day share with his victims."

<P>
"In the history of crime, personal or political, seldom appears a man who is 
ashamed of his evil deed. Saddam has demonstrated through his successive moves 
since Aug. 1 that he is proud rather than repentant of his crime of savagery. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Saddam ordered his troops to invade Kuwait. A supposed brother was happily 
killing a true brother who had resolutely stood by the side of Iraq when it was 
facing a formidable enemy. Saddam cut the hand that fed him for a decade. Then 
he planned to invade Saudi Arabia. This is the height of Saddam's ingratitude, 
as during the Gulf War, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments and people helped his 
regime even at the cost of their own comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"This man must be stopped, because all his power and might is due only to the 
sacrifices of Saudi, Kuwaiti and other Gulf Arab people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to push Iraq back from Kuwait, restore that country to the 
rightful rules as demanded by its people, and above all, punish Saddam Hussein 
-- the killer of Arabs -- even if it means his removal from power. That last 
thing is also in the interests of the Iraqi people who have been mercilessly 
suppressed by the police state established by Saddam.

"The issue has changed from an Iraqi-Kuwaiti confrontation into an 
Arab-American one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We were hoping that the Arabs would be divided into three fronts, namely the 
two disputants and a third front, led by Egypt to mediate. We were, however, 
disappointed after the summit conference as the Egyptian state put its full 
weight behind one of the two parties, thus deepening the division and rendering 
impossible an Arab settlement that would remove the justification of a foreign 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
A principle and an observation has to be asserted here. The principle is that 
the difference among the Arab ranks must cease immediately, or be graded down 
to a secondary importance once the fighting is turned into an Arab-American 
one. "We are not interested now in how the conflict has been transformed into 
its current picture! Who started the problem? Why did he start it? Was he right 
in triggering it? Was it possible to avoid the crisis or prevent its 
exacerbation? Such questions are meaningless now and are of interest only to 
historians. It is an interest of the Arab and Islamic peoples now that armies 
of all the arrogant are flocking and coming together to hit an Arab-Islamic 
country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our people cannot forgive those who invited these foreign forces to our 
homeland. We cannot forgive those who are enabling aliens and enemies to break 
our necks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This talk is applicable to any country and any ruler. What then may be the 
case when the country desecrated by the foreign forces is the territory of the 
two holy shrines of Islam? How may disgrace and concession go as far as 
bringing enemies to protect the territory of Islam and its sacred places?"

the Arab world, and on the whole, the respect that she has in all the

"Very quickly, France sensed the danger that she was running, giving the

U.S. SENDING SUPPLIES FROM EMIRATES AIR BASE; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDUP: DEFENSE SECRETARY DICK CHENEY PRAISES THE LATEST GULF COUNTRY TO OPEN 
ITS DOORS TO OUTSIDE FORCES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday announced that U.S. Air Force planes 
have begun operating out of a base in the United Arab Emirates, and he praised 
the "strong commitment" of the Emirates, the latest Persian Gulf country to 
open its doors to outside forces in the military confrontation with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The touring Pentagon leader said that C-130 cargo planes are using Bateen Air 
Base to ferry supplies to American troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Emirates, a confederation of seven small oil sheikdoms, announced Sunday 
that it had agreed to host "some Arab and friendly forces" in the face of the 
threat to its big neighbor and alliance partner, Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"That reveals the strong commitment of the men and women of this country to 
defend their way of life and to rally behind their leadership at this time," 
Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The C-130s had, in fact, begun operations from Bateen five days ago, American 
military officers told reporters traveling with Cheney. "But I don't think 
anybody knows how long they'll be here," said Col. Dave Mason, commander of the 
314th Tactical Airlift Squadron, who has 16 C-130s and 575 airmen in a unit 
flown to the Emirates from Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney told reporters aboard his plane on a four-day tour of the crisis region 
that the American commitment is "long-term" and that he could not speculate on 
what the size of the force will be "one or two years from now." 
</P>
<P>
The impression that U.S. military units will be in the Persian Gulf on an 
open-ended deployment to safeguard oil production vital to the industrialized 
world has been supported by gulf officials in private conversations over the 
last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis requested Western support in the face of an Iraqi threat to their 
oil fields after Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Saudi 
Arabia's neighbor Kuwait. Following the Saudis' lead, the normally cautious 
Arab states on the west coast of the gulf, one by one, joined the defense. 
British airplanes flew to Oman in the first days of the crisis. Last week, 
Bahrain approved open use of its airfields by British jets. 
</P>
<P>
All the small countries, bound in alliance to Saudi Arabia under the Gulf 
Cooperation Council, supported the deployment of the first foreign forces on 
Saudi soil. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Bahrain and other gulf states say their governments are now 
prepared for a long-term strategy to repel any aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very realistic," one said, discarding the notion that the gulf 
states can provide their own security. "The whole world agrees that there is a 
danger to the international economic system" if the Persian Gulf is unstable. 
</P>
<P>
"The principle will be here for a long time. The Americans will be here, and 
the British will supplement them," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
In this crisis, the Emirates were the first to act. When the Iraqi army first 
threatened Kuwait in late July, in an oil-production dispute that also involved 
the Emirates, President Bush sent two KC-135 refueling tankers to the gulf for 
exercises with the Emirates' minuscule air force of French-made Mirage 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 314th Squadron has set up shop in the desert heat. The airmen are 
housed in 50 air-conditioned trailers provided by the Emirates' central 
government in Abu Dhabi. Col. Mason, the commander, said his planes were 
ferrying food, ammunition and weapons from Bateen Air Base to the growing force 
of American Marines and paratroopers on the ground in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"The total size of the final deployment will depend on future developments," 
said Cheney, who left the Emirates for stops Monday in Oman, a sultanate just 
outside the Persian Gulf, and the Saudi city of Jidda, on the Red Sea coast. 
"I'm especially pleased that U.S. forces are among those accepted by the UAE in 
defense of the gulf," he declared after meeting with the Emirates' president, 
Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a measure of the seriousness of the situation and shows how deeply 
concerned they are about Saddam Hussein. They want to cooperate with the United 
States and other forces in the region." 
</P>
<P>
He made no disclosure of U.S. deployments beyond the airlift squadron. The 
Emirates' acceptance of foreign forces specifically mentioned the possibility 
of Arab units joining a multinational defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Emirates government, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "has agreed to 
receiving some Arab and friendly forces as a contribution towards Arab and 
international efforts to defend the region." 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Bahraini officials had announced their approval of use of 
airfields on the small island nation by British forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 7, less than a week after Iraqi tanks and troops poured across the 
Kuwaiti frontier and occupied the oil sheikdom, President Bush ordered U.S. 
troops and warplanes onto Saudi Arabian soil at the request of King Fahd, whose 
country was threatened by Iraqi armor driving south from Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
The first American planes began arriving in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province the 
next day, marking the first foreign deployment in the gulf states. Britain sent 
in a squadron of Tornado fighters and flew a squadron of Jaguar warplanes to 
Oman. 
</P>
<P>
American naval forces had been operating in the international waters of the 
gulf for years, demonstrating the right of free passage. In the 1980-88 war 
between Iran and Iraq, American warplanes flew cover over Navy ships escorting 
Kuwaiti oil tankers reflagged under the Stars and Stripes to qualify them for 
American protection. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy kept Kuwaiti oil moving to world markets but was marked by tragedy 
in 1987 when an Iraqi Exocet missile hit the frigate Stark, killing 37 U.S. 
sailors. Baghdad said the attack was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, a missile fired by the guided missile cruiser Vincennes felled 
an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. Vincennes' officers said the plane 
was mistaken for an attacking warplane. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Iran-Iraq truce that ended the war in 1988, Washington has kept a 
presence in the gulf in the form of an eight-ship task force. 
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, including those in the gulf, have traditionally insisted that 
Arab disputes should be left to them. But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has 
changed the tune along the oil-rich waterway. 
</P>
<P>
"The political existence of the Middle East as we know it is now in jeopardy," 
said a key official in one gulf state. "Others dream of Arab unity. But it is 
not even a dream. It's a fiction. It's completely destroyed."

GANG HOMICIDES INCREASE 69% IN L.A. COUNTY AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: AUTHORITIES BLAME HEAVY FIREPOWER, IMPACT OF POVERTY AND APPEAL OF A 
'TRENDY' IMAGE.

<P>
Gang killings in unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County soared 69% 
during the first eight months of this year, a period during which all violent 
crimes in the same region rose 20%, according to figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide increase is concentrated in the southern and eastern portions of 
the county where gang activity has been a constant problem, Sheriff's 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies and representatives of agencies whose primary mission is to deal with 
gangs offered a range of theories why the rate of gang-related murders has 
risen so suddenly and so high. The reasons vary from the powerful armaments 
being carried by gang members to the worsening impact of poverty and the 
growing appeal of the gang image in urban pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become trendy to belong to a gang," said Steve Valdivia, executive 
director of County Youth Gang Services, which counsels youths, monitors gang 
activity and educates the community about gangs. "Innocent kids are dressing 
like gang members . . . and getting blown away for it." 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia also cited a major influx of immigrants from Latin America and other 
Third World areas "who have adopted the gang lifestyle and are not as fearful 
of law enforcement in this country as they were in their homelands." 
</P>
<P>
Wes McBride, operations sergeant for the Sheriff's Department, placed the 
blame, among other factors, on worsening social conditions in the urban core. 
"To find the hot spots for gang activity all you do is lay a poverty map over 
Los Angeles County," he said. "The social conditions surrounding poverty create 
a ripe gang environment; some people see crime as the only outlet available to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, 103 gang slayings were committed in unincorporated 
county communities this year, compared to 61 during the same period a year ago. 
That compares to 116 gang murders committed in the same parts of Los Angeles 
County in all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a humongous increase," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the city limits of Los Angeles gang-related murders rose, but not nearly 
as dramatically. During the first six months of this year -- the last period 
for which statistics were available -- police reported gang homicides up 12.4% 
</P>
<P>
The rapid rise in these gang crimes coincides with a dramatic increase in gang 
membership, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to law enforcement authorities, the estimated number of gang members 
in the greater Los Angeles area has doubled in the past five years. In 1985, 
these officials estimated there were 50,000 gang members in the region. This 
year, that number is placed at 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the newest gang members are Latinos, who are dying in gang-related 
violence in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half of 1989, we had 20 Hispanic-versus-Hispanic gang murders, 
compared with 47 so far this year," said Undersheriff Robert Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang problem is out of control but law enforcement cannot take care of it 
alone. We need to come to grips with it together -- the county, law 
enforcement, schools, parents." 
</P>
<P>
The worsening gang homicide statistics have prompted the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office to consider reassigning prosecutors to its 
overloaded gang division, and has renewed calls for additional funding for 
community anti-gang programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang murder rate is up and I need more people to effectively prosecute," 
said Mike Genelin, who heads the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
hard-core gang unit. "Theoretically, that means we'll have to fault another 
area because our entire office is constrained to work within a budget." 
</P>
<P>
Among the communities patrolled by sheriff's deputies, the largest increase in 
gang slayings was reported in Lynwood, where there have been 23 gang homicides 
to date. There were 13 murders reported there during the same period last year. 
In Industry there have been 10 such slayings so far this year, compared with to 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend I had between 10 and 15 reported shootings and two weeks ago I 
had 15 shootings," said Lynwood Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Holmes. "I don't know the 
reason why. I wish I knew." 
</P>
<P>
The picture is not all bleak. 
</P>
<P>
In the once-notorious jurisdiction of Los Angeles' South Bureau, the number of 
slayings continued to decline. Police and community activists credit law 
enforcement crackdowns coupled with gang intervention programs for the steady 
decrease that has gained the attention of communities throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bureau's Southeast Division reported no gang-related killings during 
the month of July for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
"Things we're doing are paying off," said South Bureau Deputy Chief William 
Rathburn. "We're targeting specific gangs and gang members, and we've improved 
our intelligence and analysis-gathering ability." 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, gang intervention groups such as County Youth Gang Services 
are working very hard here," added Rathburn, "and we are organizing youth 
programs we run out of the police stations such as basketball, soccer and 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the new statistics were being released, the body count continued to 
rise in greater Los Angeles as 22 people died in violent confrontations over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend slayings included the deaths of three gang members in Los Angeles 
and a man shot when rivals in a passing car fired an assault rifle at a crowd 
celebrating the birthday of a 9-year-old in Pomona, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate attack, a 26-year-old man was was shot several times early Monday 
morning while standing on a sidewalk in a South Los Angeles neighborhood known 
for gang activity, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the worsening gang picture, Sheriff Sherman Block has scheduled 
a meeting for October in hopes of mobilizing elected officials and community 
leaders from gang-plagued communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The growing problem of gang killings is a tragic phenomenon that must be 
addressed by all law abiding citizens," said sheriff's spokesman Doug McClure. 
"It is hoped that this meeting will result in a clear commitment to start on 
the long road to a resolution of this appalling situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Statistics on gang crimes depend largely on how law enforcement agencies do 
their counting. The Los Angeles Police Department defines gang-motivated crimes 
as those resulting directly from gang activity. Gang-related incidents are 
defined as those in which the assailant or the victim is a gang member, but 
where the crime does not necessarily result from gang activity. The Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, by contrast, makes no distinction between 
gang-motivated and gang-related crimes, placing all such crimes in a single 
category. 
</P>
<P>

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reports a 69% increase in gang 
homicides in unincorporated areas for the first eight months of the year. The 
following chart compares the number of homicides reported at eight-month and 
one-year intervals, dating back to 1985.

HOSTAGES: A WEAPON OF THE AGES;

CAPTIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR POLITICAL RANSOM SINCE CAESAR'S TIME. THE TACTIC

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Saddam Hussein's detention of 12,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait is 
without numerical precedent, hostage-taking is one of the oldest tools of 
warfare, dating back more than 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Caesar was held hostage by pirates in 75 BC, before ransoming himself 
and returning to crucify his captors. In the 12th Century, the archduke of 
Austria and the German emperor held King Richard I of England hostage in a 
Rhine castle, finally releasing him for a "king's ransom" and a pledge of 
allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1795, the U.S. Congress paid a ransom of $1 million -- one-sixth of the 
entire federal budget -- to gain the release of 115 American sailors held 
hostage by Barbary pirates in North Africa. Twenty years later, Congress 
declared war against the dey, or ruler, of Algiers to gain the release of 10 
more sailors. The pasha gave up his captives when a U.S. squadron sailed into 
his harbor. 
</P>
<P>
To many Americans today, the image of fellow citizens being held hostage cuts 
to the marrow of national pride and recalls the feeling of helplessness 
engendered by the 1979-81 crisis involving American hostages in the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran. Carrying an American passport is now often a liability 
rather than a guarantee of safety, and with 2 million Americans working abroad, 
the rules of the game have changed permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"Hostages have become a way of life," Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage-taking is not unique to the Middle East, however, and from Bolivia to 
Malaysia, from El Salvador to the Philippines, Americans have been taken 
captive in recent years by terrorists demanding everything from the resignation 
of the U.S. President to the release from prison of other terrorists, says 
Karen Gardela, head of the terrorism data base at RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. 
Nor are Americans the only ones who are stalked by hostage-takers these days: 
More than 130 foreigners from 21 nations have been taken captive in Lebanon 
alone since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Middle East the stakes have always been high, and Saddam Hussein has 
raised the ante greatly, well aware that hostage situations crippled two 
American presidents in varying degrees and that the current situation presents 
President Bush with the wrenching necessity of trying to balance foreign policy 
with the need to protect American lives. 
</P>
<P>
Americans abroad have taken increased security precautions for years, 
particularly in the Middle East and Latin America, but the American targets are 
so limitless now that hostile groups have found hostage-taking to be their most 
cost-efficient weapon -- indeed, often their only weapon -- in facing more 
powerful nations. Although terrorism may seldom achieve long-range 
nationalistic goals, it has become an equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
Because Western democracies place such a high value on the lives of individual 
citizens, they are particularly vulnerable to terrorist attack. And because 
America's foreign policy -- as well as its economic and military strength -- 
extends to every corner of the globe, there is virtually nowhere that some 
group or government does not take issue with U.S. goals. To terrorists, 
American civilians are the easiest "soft" target to strike in an attempt to 
alter U.S. policies. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, holding hostages has been an investment whose value may grow as the 
victims' governments try to gain their release. West Germany, South Korea and 
France have all paid handsomely to buy freedom for their citizens. 
"Hostage-taking is like buying futures," one terrorism expert says. However, in 
the case of the 3,000 Americans being held in Kuwait and Iraq, buying the 
hostages' freedom doesn't appear to be an option; and because of the numbers 
involved, President Bush doesn't have the same choices that Presidents Jimmy 
Carter and Ronald Reagan had. 
</P>
<P>
"In previous hostage situations, such as in Iran 10 years ago, the question 
was, 'Was the United States willing to go to war in an effort to bring its 
people home?' and the answer was, 'No,' " says Brian Jenkins, a terrorism 
expert who is managing director of Kroll Associates, a Los Angeles-based 
international consulting firm that specializes in corporate security and risk 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is very different from Iran because the United States has 
already indicated its willingness to go to war against Iraq. So I don't see how 
taking the hostages can be effective for Saddam, except by creating distraction 
and trying to erode the solidarity of the world by releasing some nations' 
hostages and not others." 
</P>
<P>
The situation also differs from some others with which Washington has grappled 
because in Iraq and Kuwait there are no friendly forces to render assistance. 
When, for instance, Bolivian guerrillas held 52 people, including Americans, 
hostage for more than two days in 1981, they threatened to blow up a local 
refinery associated with Occidental Petroleum unless President Reagan resigned. 
All the hostages were safely freed after Bolivian soldiers stormed the 
terrorists' stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier days of hostage-taking, the terrorists' primary goals were to 
discredit local governments, win regional concessions or call attention to 
their cause. The 1978 abduction and murder in Italy of former Prime Minister 
Aldo Moro and, in the same country, the 1981 kidnaping of U.S. Brig. Gen. James 
L. Dozier (who was later freed in a raid by Italian carabinieri) fell into this 
category. Even the early hijackings of airliners by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization -- some of which included brief hostage situations -- were 
intended to pressure Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But the goals changed with hostage-taking in Iran, Lebanon and now Kuwait and 
Iraq. Today the goal is to sway the foreign policies of the world's major 
powers. The hostage crisis in Iran was about ideology. However painful the 
moment was for America, it was, as Judith Kipper of the Brookings Institution 
pointed out, one that Washington could still buy its way out of with money, 
favors or assurances. 
</P>
<P>
With Iraq, ideology is not at stake. At issue instead are the ambitions and 
pride of a military dictator who has shown himself willing to go to any 
extremes to fulfill his goals. 
</P>
<P>
Given the failure of two U.S. presidents to deal successfully with hostage 
crises, and considering the huge foreign community in Kuwait and Iraq, 
President Bush is facing what could become a personal exigency. He cannot, 
political analysts say, afford to appear indecisive or weak in what looks like 
the most serious challenge to U.S. interests since the Cold War ended. 
</P>
<P>
Although public opinion polls indicate high support for the deployment of U.S. 
forces to Saudi Arabia, enthusiasm could flag if the confrontation is allowed 
to drag on for months or even years, as seems to happen with most disputes in 
the Middle East. If world support, particularly that of Arab states, begins 
drifting away, the United States would find itself in the dangerous position of 
standing alone in the Middle East as the sole protector of Western interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, it was predictable that he would take the 
hostages, too," says Brookings' Kipper. "Now that he's got them, he's not 
susceptible to favors and assurances. He wants the 100% of what he's got. 
Saddam is fearless, tremendously courageous, very smart. He's calculated this 
very well. He's not someone who's going to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, we went over there with three things in mind: Protect Saudi Arabia, 
get a rollback of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and the recognition that we can't 
live with Saddam Hussein, who will have the potential for nuclear capabilities 
in a few years and be the leader of an economic superpower by the end of the 
decade. The balances in the gulf were distorted when Iran left the equation, 
and since we can't ask for Iran's help in defeating Iraq, we are truly in a 
fix." 
</P>
<P>
In taking the hostages, Hussein may be playing for time, looking for a weapon 
that will erode U.S. public support. Surely he remembers how firm President 
Reagan's commitment to Lebanon was -- and how quickly Reagan withdrew the 
forces after 241 U.S. servicemen were killed in an attack on their barracks in 
1983. The Iraqi president is a man of great patience, a virtue that he is 
confident is not shared by the American body politic. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the hostages' fate, Saddam Hussein -- a man Washington 
supported in the later stages of his eight-year war against Iran -- has raised 
the stakes and perhaps changed the shape of future international conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis marks the institutionalization of hostage-taking as an instrument 
of modern war," says Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shield issue now, which makes it harder to get the hostages back. 
There's no demand that can be agreed to to get Saddam to back down. Even if it 
were a realistic option and we left the gulf, why should Saddam give up the 
hostages as the guarantee that we won't come back? 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are really tired of the Middle East in general, the unhappy 
experiences we've had there, and they're very tired of hostages," Hoffman says. 
"We're drained. 
</P>
<P>
"All the hostage problems we've had over the past 10 years have been 
exponentially increased with this crisis. The stakes are higher than they've 
ever been, and so are the dilemmas we face. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we could get them, there are more hostages than there are members of 
Delta Force. You're not talking about a rescue raid, but a mass commando 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's action, there will have to be an international consensus, since any 
attempt to rescue one nationality would endanger other nationalities."

<P>
LAW: TWO BYSTANDERS SAW WOMAN'S DEATH ON PALM SPRINGS TRAMWAY BUT WERE NOT 
PHYSICALLY HARMED. JUSTICES ALLOW THEM TO SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL 
TRAUMA.

<P>
The state Supreme Court, acting on an unusual legal claim, on Monday allowed 
two unharmed passengers to seek monetary damages for the emotional trauma they 
say they suffered in a fatal accident on the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in 
June, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last 
May by a state Court of Appeal permitting the passengers to sue for emotional 
distress after they were splattered with the blood of a woman killed in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, however, limited the effect of the appellate ruling by barring 
it from being used as a precedent in other cases. Such so-called "horror" suits 
are said to be on the rise nationally, and the California case had been widely 
watched in legal circles. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, state courts generally had limited the recovery of damages to 
instances where emotional distress results from witnessing the death or serious 
injury of a child or other close relative. 
</P>
<P>
The suit at issue was filed by David Ballinger and Jacqueline Didier, two of 
about 50 passengers riding in a tramway car when a component of the system 
crashed through the plexiglass roof, fatally injuring Elaine Tseko, 27. Both 
were showered with Tseko's blood. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger and Didier sued the Mt. San Jacinto Winter Park Authority, the state 
and other defendants for an unspecified amount of damages. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger said he suffered from nightmares, flashbacks and acute 
claustrophobia, feared entering elevators, airplanes and buses, and had not 
been able to resume skiing because ski lifts reminded him of the tramway. 
Didier cited similar effects from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
A Riverside County Superior Court rejected their claims but the appeals court, 
in a 2-1 ruling, said Ballinger and Didier -- even though unharmed and 
unrelated to the victim -- could sue for distress. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Justice Thomas E. Hollenhorst, joined by Justice Howard M. Dabney, 
said individuals in a "zone of danger" as the two passengers were could sue for 
the trauma they suffered out of fear for their own safety. In that sense, 
Ballinger and Didier could be viewed as "direct victims," not just bystanders, 
the majority said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sharp dissent, Appellate Justice F. Douglas McDaniel called the ruling 
"astounding," saying it represented "the most drastic enlargement of tort 
liability" in such cases in well over a century. Under the majority's analysis, 
McDaniel said, suit could be brought by any unharmed motorists who were on a 
section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland when it collapsed during in the Oct. 
17 Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the defendants in the case expressed similar concerns in their 
subsequent appeal to the state Supreme Court. Virtually any bystander to a 
serious accident could sue on the grounds of a "close call," vastly expanding 
the current limits of legal liability, the lawyers warned. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Ballinger and Didier replied that the defendants' claims were 
"greatly exaggerated and distorted." The public has a right to expect safe 
recreational facilities, and allowing such lawsuits would justly deter the 
production and use of defective equipment, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Peter J. Koenig of San Francisco, an attorney for the park authority 
and the state, welcomed the high court's limit on wider application of the 
appellate ruling but still voiced disappointment that the tramway case itself 
now can go to trial. "This was a gross exaggeration of liability in these kinds 
of settings," Koenig said. "You may go through an intersection just before an 
accident and then think, 'There for the grace of God go I.' But that's not 
grounds for a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the two plaintiffs could not be reached for comment.

STANDOFF ENDS WITH 2 OFFICERS INJURED, 3 MEN FOUND SLAIN

A gunman firing wildly from inside a mobile home wounded two sheriff's deputies 
and apparently killed three people early Monday before surrendering at the end 
of a nine-hour standoff, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz Joachim Podszuweit, 30, was arrested at his Lake Elsinore home on 
Plessner Way by Riverside County sheriff's deputies at 9:05 a.m. Inside, 
authorities found the bodies of three unidentified males, along with a 
high-powered rifle and hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
Podszuweit, a burly man who was wearing camouflage pants when he surrendered 
after hours of tense negotiations with authorities, was described by a 
sheriff's spokesman as a survivalist with a military background. 
</P>
<P>
But little more was known about the man, the three slain men or motivation for 
the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept to himself a lot," said neighbor Gonzalo Cornejo, who has lived on the 
street for 10 years. "He wasn't the kind who waved and talked and went out of 
the way to be friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Wounded in the incident were Deputies Albert Jones, who was struck in the foot 
by a bullet and hospitalized at Inland Valley Medical Center in Lake Elsinore, 
and Joseph Hack, who was treated for shrapnel wounds caused when bullet 
fragments bounced off his bulletproof vest and struck his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The episode seemed out of place on Plessner Way, a peaceful, unpaved road lined 
with tidy mobile homes, most of them on half-acre lots and owned by retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the shooting erupted shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday and continued 
intermittently past daybreak. Some residents likened the eerie sound to that 
heard on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear them whistling," said Ray Mohlman, 74, who was visiting a 
friend who lives on Plessner Way. "The bullets were screaming around." 
</P>
<P>
Hunkered down in his brown mobile home, shrouded by a tree and encircled by two 
fences bearing a "No Trespassing" sign, Podszuweit fired his automatic weapon, 
leaving his mark on everything within range, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Gray, a retiree who has lived nearby for 15 years, said he heard 
"hundreds of shots, lots and lots -- you couldn't count 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Six patrol cars were damaged by the gunfire, as were other vehicles on the 
street and the walls and windows of adjacent mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies from the Lake Elsinore substation arrived at the scene, they 
entered Podszuweit's home and were met by gunfire, resulting in the injuries to 
Jones and Hack. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities then attempted to resolve the standoff through negotiations. The 
talks were cut off continually by Podszuweit, who was hysterical, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After evacuating the area shortly before dawn, the sheriff's special weapons 
team again attempted to enter the home. But they were turned away by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
To most residents, Podszuweit is a mystery, a man who kept a low profile and 
mostly worked on the dozen or so dilapidated cars and trucks that cluttered his 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Cornejo said Podszuweit, who had lived on Plessner Way for about three years, 
was married and had a young daughter. But his wife and child had apparently 
moved out of the home last month. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Ernie McIntosh, 68, said he once hosted Podszuweit in his home. 
Podszuweit had said he was a mechanic, and McIntosh was looking for help with 
his ailing Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a big guy, and a few years ago he was a good guy," McIntosh said, 
recalling their visit. But lately, McIntosh added, Podszuweit had become 
unfriendly and moody -- even walking off in mid-sentence while conversing with 
neighbors in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Podszuweit had lately been receiving a stream of late-night visitors, 
irritating those who lived near him. 
</P>
<P>
As police continued their investigation Monday evening, jittery residents said 
the violence was an unlikely visitor to their normally tranquil lives. 
</P>
<P>
As Gray, 74, put it: "The only problem we've had here before this was when I 
had my boat stolen."

VANITY PLATES: ONE MAN'S SLUR IS ANOTHER MAN'S BADGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
An unprecedented state recall of personalized license plates bearing words 
considered slurs against Italians has run into sharp opposition from an 
unexpected quarter: scores of Italian-Americans who display such plates on 
their cars with pride. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles' recall of 333 vanity plates inscribed with 
the words wop or dago was initiated at the urging of the Sons of Italy, an 
85-year-old fraternal organization that says the terms are deeply offensive to 
most Italian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But DMV officials have been inundated with protests from Italian-Americans who 
purchased such plates as somewhat tongue-in-cheek tributes to their ethnic 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, Annette Lombardi, a Santa Rosa attorney whose Ford 
Taurus carries a plate reading DAGO ESQ. And Dave Giordano, a Fresno paper 
distributor whose Cadillac sports a plate saying TOP WOPS. And Patricia 
Tedeschi, a San Clemente property manager whose plate reads NY DAGO. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV mailed notices last month to holders of the targeted plates, including 
FOXYWOP, LIL DAGO, BBOPWOP and 14KWOP. Those who refuse to return them will be 
unable to renew their vehicle registrations, the DMV said. 
</P>
<P>
But as of last week, 162 plate-holders -- most of them Italian-Americans -- had 
requested special hearings to contest the recall. Only 13 had given back their 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing that there's such attachment to a license plate," said DMV 
spokesman William Gengler in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The recall originally included a number of plates that could be considered 
offensive to Italians only under the most humorless interpretation. One example 
is DUWOP39, which is held by a Fresno couple who are '50s music aficionados and 
drive a restored 1939 Ford coupe. 
</P>
<P>
But the DMV recently dropped the DUWOP couple and about 25 other motorists from 
the recall list after further checking determined that their plate inscriptions 
had nothing to do with insulting Italians. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV has routinely censored ethnically and sexually offensive words since it 
began issuing vanity plates in 1970, and has canceled offensive plates that 
sometimes slip through. But the present effort is the first mass recall the 
agency has staged for such reasons, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Sons of Italy spokesman Richard Armento, a Palm Springs insurance broker, said 
his group, which has 14,000 California members, and many other 
Italian-Americans strongly back the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any Italian who puts these plates on their car does it as a slur 
to Italians. But they don't realize what they're doing. They don't know how 
many people are offended by this," Armento said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that to many older Italian-Americans -- especially those from East 
Coast cities -- the words wop and dago are hated reminders of times during 
their youth when anti-Italian discrimination was strong. 
</P>
<P>
"When they went to the grocery store, they had to fight their way through the 
Irish part of town or the black part of town, with people calling them wop and 
dago every step of the way. And then they had to fight their way back," Armento 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Italian-Americans whose license plates are in jeopardy scoff at Armento's 
reasoning. They say they put the words on their plates to signify, somewhat 
humorously, their pride in being Italian. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Muscolo, a Glendora mortgage banker who has a plate reading 4TOPWOP, said 
it gives him a special identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I know -- family, friends and relatives -- refers to me as the top 
wop. It's my trademark. They're trying to take away my trademark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Muscolo, 43, accused the Sons of Italy of "living in the past," saying that 
anti-Italian discrimination has faded dramatically over the years, especially 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
The word wop came into common use during the 1920s as a derogatory term for an 
illiterate Italian immigrant working as a day laborer, according to the 
Dictionary of American Slang. Some language experts believe the word may have 
originated as an acronym for "without papers" to describe immigrants who 
entered the U.S. without passports. 
</P>
<P>
George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at UC Berkeley, said slurs aimed at 
ethnic or racial minorities tend to lose their sting as the groups become more 
assimilated and more secure in their social standing. 
</P>
<P>
For Italian-Americans to use wop and dago on their license plates "fits Italian 
humor very well. It's a slightly self-deprecating joke that has no threat to 
it," said Lakoff, who specializes in semantics, the study of word meanings and 
how they change. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, he said, ethnic insults remain very serious matters to groups such 
as Jews and blacks, who feel their position in the social order is far from 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
DMV computers came up with 500 California motorists whose plates contain the 
disputed words or a close variation, said spokesman Gengler. It later dropped 
some plate-holders from the list after determining that their slogans referred 
to things other than ethnic slurs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the plates on the original list were at least 10 that are variations on 
the word doo-wop, a musical style popularized during the '50s. DMV spokeswoman 
Gina McGuiness said the DMV relented on the doo-woppers' plates after receiving 
a letter from a group called the Doowop Society, saying members' plate slogans 
refer only to '50s-era songs. 
</P>
<P>
Another plate the DMV retreated from recalling came up on its computer as 
4DEGO. It is registered to Sheldon N. Goldman, who owns a Los Angeles clothing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said the plate, which adorns his Rolls-Royce, is intended as 4 D EGO, 
meaning "for the ego." 
</P>
<P>
"What other plate can you put on a Rolls-Royce?" said Goldman, laughing. "I 
tried to get HUMBLE, but somebody else already had it." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the recall has won support from a number of other organizations, 
including the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
Armento, the Sons of Italy spokesman, said his organization believes that 
regardless of how plate-holders interpret their plate inscriptions, it is 
inappropriate for the state to issue license plates carrying words that offend 
Italian-Americans or any other ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize a lot of people think it's funny, and I know ethnics say these 
things among themselves," Armento said. "But you shouldn't do it in public, 
because it only furthers an ethnic stereotype."

YOSEMITE OPENS AGAIN TO LONG LINES OF VISITORS

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every other summer, Jose Romo and 40 of his closest friends and family set up 
camp in Yosemite Valley. "It's our favorite corner of the world," Romo said 
Monday as he looked down at the valley from the Tunnel View overlook, one of 
the most popular spots for viewing the park's scenery. 
</P>
<P>
It's a love affair shared by many Americans, and for them -- the many thousands 
who cherish Yosemite and its spectacular glacial valley -- Romo had good news 
after informally inspecting the fire damage to the park . 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of heartbreaking to see the charred woods as we came up, but it's 
better than we thought," said Romo, who drove to Yosemite on Monday from 
Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
He was among the first wave of visitors to pass through the gates as Yosemite 
Valley reopened for business after a 10-day hiatus from tour buses and crowds. 
The fires that forced the valley's evacuation are all but out now, their smoke 
just a light haze in the morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of the 10:30 a.m. opening -- moved up from noon due to long 
lines at the two main gates -- squirrels and picnickers were again doing 
battle. After being denied picnic scraps for 10 days, squirrels all over the 
valley were pestering visitors for handouts. Kevin La, a resident of Garden 
Grove, came back from pitching his tent at the Lower River campground to find 
four squirrels in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife may be more aggressive than usual for a few days, park naturalists 
say, but otherwise the only differences that visitors will see from the way 
Yosemite used to be is in the fire areas along roads leading into the valley. 
Burned trees there have been felled to clear hazards, the naturalists 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
At Lower River campground, one of the first arrivals Monday was Khosrow Sarai, 
who correctly guessed that he would not need a reservation because the fires 
forced many vacationers to make other plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew because of the fire there would be plenty of places," said Sarai, who 
had the Merced River nearly to himself as he fished with his two sons. "We got 
a nice (campsite) by the water too.' 
</P>
<P>
Sarai said the fire damage he saw along California 41, the worst-hit area, was 
not as severe as he feared. 
</P>
<P>
"It took away some of the scenery, but it's nature -- nature started it and 
nature will bring (the forest) back." 
</P>
<P>
The fires were started two weeks ago by an intense lightning storm that 
squatted for a day over the west flank of the Sierra Nevada. A few smaller 
fires still burn in Yosemite, but most of the 3,100 firefighters here a week 
ago have left. 
</P>
<P>
There was no lightning Monday, but visitors did experience the unpredictable 
Sierra weather, which a day earlier had produced showers in the valley and 
three inches of snow at Tuolumne Meadows in the park's high country. Skies were 
blue Monday morning, but by midafternoon gray clouds blocked the sun and 
temperatures plunged into the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
Chief naturalist Len McKenzie said the park was not as busy Monday as might be 
expected on a typical summer day, but he said rooms and campsites should be 
full again by midweek. "Park operations seem to be getting back to normal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ahwahnee Hotel, where nicely appointed rooms with wet bars and VCRs go 
for as much as $238 a night, the beds had been made and waiting for guests for 
several days. Bellhop Steve Harding said he was eager to get back to normal. "I 
can use the tips after 11 days off," Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room, famed for its cathedral ceiling and views of the cliffs, 
reopened at noon to about a dozen people with a menu that included curry 
zucchini soup and breaded sea bass. Guests arriving in the lobby were greeted 
by pianist Dudley Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice way to welcome people back," said Kendall, who gets to live in the 
valley in return for playing piano five nights a week in the hotel dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The first guests to check in, Ann and Joe Winstead, drove into the Sierra from 
Los Gatos on Sunday night to beat the rush and were in line at the park's Arch 
Rock gate by 8:30 a.m. They unloaded a small refrigerator and enough books and 
provisions to last a week in one of the Ahwahnee's private cottages. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the cottages because they're a little bigger than the rooms and the 
deer come right up to your door," said Ann Winstead. Unlike other guests, who 
reserved rooms a year ago only to lose the booking because of fire, the 
Winsteads' stay had been scheduled to begin Monday. "We planned this pretty 
well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Ahwahnee rooms remained unbooked by midafternoon, but manager Curt 
Abramson said they would probably be filled Monday night. "We usually get some 
walk-in traffic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tunnel View, which was deserted at sunset on Sunday, tour buses idled at 
noon Monday and 20 cameras were trained on the granite cliffs that form 
Yosemite Valley, a box canyon 3,000 feet deep that was formed by long-ago 
glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
"We came all the way and we were afraid we wouldn't get to see it," said Diane 
Arnold, who traveled from Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
On the valley floor, which was abandoned by all but park workers and 
firefighters in the early-morning evacuation Aug. 10, rangers set up a radar 
gun to clock and cite speeders. 
</P>
<P>
"People are racing around trying to see everything before everyone else does," 
one ranger said.

AMERICANS ADVISED TO DEPART FROM JORDAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: U.S. CITIZENS HAVE NOT BEEN TARGETS OF VIOLENCE. BUT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT SEEMS WARY OF AMMAN'S SUPPORT OF IRAQ.

AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department on Monday advised Americans in Jordan to leave the 
country, apparently reflecting the uncertainty that has developed because of 
Jordan's support for Iraq in the crisis over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also advised Americans to postpone any non-essential 
travel to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy spokesman Jonathan Owen said the embassy is permitting lower-level 
staff members and staff dependents to leave "on a voluntary basis." 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether any Americans in Amman are making urgent plans to 
leave. Owen would not say whether any embassy personnel or dependents are 
leaving. About 4,000 Americans live in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
A number of anti-American demonstrations have taken place in Jordan since the 
United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia to discourage any further Iraqi 
expansion after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators have burned the U.S. flag and chanted "Death to America!" 
Americans have not been the targets of any violence, and in fact those who 
attend the anti-U.S. demonstrations are sometimes assured by Jordanians that 
there is nothing "personal" in the flag burnings. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein has described his neighbor Iraq's invasion as justified 
and condemned the response by U.S. and other Western governments as a colonial 
venture. The Arab people, he said, will react angrily if Iraq goes to war with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the crisis, the king was asked whether American citizens are safe in 
the Middle East, and he answered: "I honestly cannot tell categorically, but I 
believe that Arabs are hospitable people and that hopefully they would not harm 
those who are among them as their guests." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has tried to soften his position by insisting that being on good terms 
with Iraq makes it possible for him to mediate between Baghdad and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But this self-appointed role has led Jordan to maintain silence on daily 
developments. On Monday, Jordan had no official comment on Iraq's decision to 
detain foreigners against their will and to disperse them among military bases, 
weapons factories and other possible military targets. 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking Jordanian official asked about Jordan's position on the hostages 
replied, "We have to keep communication open with both sides." 
</P>
<P>
And despite Hussein's assurances to President Bush, Jordan has also failed to 
implement a United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion appears to support the king in his tilt toward Iraq. Jordanians, 
more than half of whom are Palestinians, see Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein (no 
relation to the king) as a bulwark against Israel and perhaps a means of 
freeing Palestinians from Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanians in the street, unlike their government, have been unrestrained on 
the hostage issue. It is difficult to find anyone who would condemn outright 
the seizure of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against taking hostages in principle," a newspaper columnist said, "but I 
find myself taking the Iraqi viewpoint. Why should just Iraq suffer? Is not the 
whole country hostage to an attack? Are we in Jordan not going to suffer if war 
breaks out?" 
</P>
<P>
A student encountered in a restaurant remarked, "Let the Americans get a taste 
of what it is like to be under threat." 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians complained about the attention paid to foreigners while the 
plight of Palestinians in the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip has been 
all but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
One, Mohammed abu Samir, said: "No one is sending armies to free Palestinians. 
Why are only the hostages important?" 
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanians expressed concern that the widespread acceptance of 
hostage-taking in Iraq suggests the emergence of something ugly in Jordanian 
society. A political scientist who asked not to be named said: "This crisis is 
bringing things out we would rather not see. If we can accept the 
hostage-taking, what will we accept next?" 
</P>
<P>
A campaign has been started to collect money for milk on grounds that the U.S. 
blockade of Iraq will soon create shortages.

The United States is moving significant forces with offensive capabilities into 
positions from which they could launch forays into occupied Kuwait, military 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The troops also have received briefings on the position of Iraqi forces in 
Kuwait and on contingency plans should the United States decide to send forces 
across the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said such a move is unlikely unless Iraqi forces cross first into Saudi 
territory. But they also suggested that the buildup of U.S. forces with 
offensive potential could be causing Iraq to adjust its strategy, perhaps 
reducing the likelihood that Iraq will attack Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the 
Kuwait-directed troop and equipment movements as routine military procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us going into Kuwait, but if those orders ever came we would 
obviously want to be ready," one senior U.S. officer in Saudi Arabia said. 
</P>
<P>
Said another official: "If it came down to that, we would have to move at 
lightning speed. So obviously, you take preliminary steps to bring up the level 
of readiness, regardless of the current plans." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mission in Saudi Arabia is described as defensive, and the first wave 
of troops to reach Saudi soil were those trained in tactics such as anti-tank 
warfare that could be used to thwart an Iraqi incursion into the Saudi kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last few days, much of the troops and material that have arrived and 
moved into forward positions have been those considered to be designed for 
offensive missions. 
</P>
<P>
These include elements of the 101st Airborne Division, an air-assault unit that 
transports its troops with helicopters; the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, 
which includes tanks, heavy artillery and Cobra attack helicopters, and other 
ground and naval forces usually geared toward offensive missions. 
</P>
<P>
The battleship Wisconsin passed through the Suez Canal on Sunday and is 
expected to make its way around the Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf, 
from which it could assist in any offensive mission. Marine amphibious forces 
also are arriving in the area, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Other attack-oriented naval forces that are in the area aboard aircraft 
carriers include A-6 attack bombers, F-18s and EA-6B radar-jamming planes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the United States and other countries participating in the multinational 
defense force in Saudi Arabia are far short of the numbers that military 
analysts believe would be necessary to mount a ground effort to force Iraqi 
troops out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the offensive-oriented buildup is having an effect on 
Iraq's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Recent U.S. intelligence reports indicate that while Iraq is maintaining a 
formidable force near the Kuwait-Saudi border, it appears to be concentrating 
more on bolstering troops deployed in a crescent-shaped line facing the gulf, 
according to military officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me that they think the Marines are coming ashore," one officer 
familiar with intelligence reports said. Iraq's defense, however, includes 
strategically placed artillery that would make any shore assault particularly 
bloody, another American official said. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in Iraqi strategy appears to decrease further the prospect of an 
Iraqi foray into Saudi Arabia, said the officials. 
</P>

Still en route is more heavy U.S. firepower, including elements of the 24th 
Mechanized Infantry Division from Ft. Stewart, Ga., which is bringing its 
powerful M-1 tanks. 
</P>

And troops continue to arrive in large numbers, many on commercial U.S. 
airliners. Passenger jets from Continental Airlines, TWA, United Airlines and 
Northwest Airlines landed at a Saudi air base Monday carrying U.S. troops and 
supplies.

Iraqi soldiers Monday were winding up their withdrawal from occupied Iranian 
territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing thousands of 
battle-hardened troops to face U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the number of Iraqi troops poised 
on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia had jumped from 160,000 to 200,000. 
That figure suggested that Iraqi soldiers from the Iranian border regions might 
already be bolstering those in Iraq-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas began Friday and was expected to 
be completed today. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, inspecting U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region, refused to say how 
many American troops have been deployed. The U.S. troops were sent to protect 
strategic, oil-rich Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran newspapers Monday attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia 
and predicted that the Saudi monarch, King Fahd, will meet the same fate as the 
deposed emir of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the newspaper Jomhuri Islami accused the king of allowing the 
United States to make Saudi Arabia a virtual U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as Iraq annexed Kuwait to its territory, the United States has annexed 
Saudi Arabia to its realm," said the newspaper, according to Iran's official 
Islamic Republic News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military 
presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas came as part of an initiative by 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week to formally end the Iran-Iraq War. 
Fighting in the eight-year conflict had effectively ended with a cease-fire two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran's southern region near the Persian Gulf, departing Iraqi troops shouted 
"Down with the U.S.!" and "Allahu Akbar!" (God is great), the Iranian news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the departing Iraqis expressed desires for "more brotherly 
relations" between their countries and waved to their former enemies as they 
pulled out of fortifications along the 30-mile-long Shalamcheh-Kushk axis. 
</P>
<P>
The troop withdrawal is accompanied by the biggest prisoner exchange since 
World War II. The United Nations and diplomats say the two sides held a total 
of 100,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio reported that 2,000 prisoners returned to the Iranian capital 
Monday in a jubilant homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said thousands of relatives and 
well-wishers thronged Tehran's Mehrabad airport and crowded surrounding 
streets. The prisoners were showered with flowers, and sheep were sacrificed 
for a traditional Islamic welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's army daily newspaper, Al Qaddisiyah, had reported that some of the 
troops formerly deployed along the 730-mile Iran-Iraq frontier would be sent 
south to confront U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have a long history of squabbling, often over the vital Shatt al 
Arab waterway they share as well as some disputed islands. So, it was no great 
shock when, on Sept. 22, 1980, Iraq bombed Tehran airport and invaded its 
neighbor to the east. Despite overwhelming Iraqi air superiority and early 
ground successes, the Iranian military, reinforced by a substantially larger 
population with a religious commitment to martyrdom, waged a bitter campaign 
and recovered much of its territory. A lengthy stalemate ensued, with Tehran 
rebuffing a series of cease-fire proposals by Baghdad. On Aug. 20, 1988, both 
combatants agreed to an uneasy, U.N.-brokered cease-fire, but peace terms could 
not be hammered out -- until Saddam Hussein's sudden acceptance of all of 
Iran's demands last week.

Because of the crisis over Kuwait, Israeli moderates appear to be sharply 
divided over renewing talks with Palestinian leaders aimed at reviving the 
Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread Palestinian support for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has 
depressed and angered generally left-wing Israelis who argue that establishing 
a dialogue with the Palestinians is more important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is most important for the government of Israel to talk with 
Palestinians and the PLO (the Palestine Liberation Organization)," said Amnon 
Goldblum, a spokesman for the Peace Now organization. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa should be an example to us. President (Frederik W.) de Klerk 
talked to (nationalist leader) Nelson Mandela even though he was the 
representative of a terrorist organization." 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Israelis make a similar move and talk with the Palestinians, 
Goldblum said, there will probably be more Palestinian violence and more 
Israeli violence in response. 
</P>
<P>
"This attitude of the government -- not talking to Palestinians -- encourages 
extremism," he said, "and I worry about the character of Israel and our 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Yael Dayan, a dovish Labor Party member of the Knesset and daughter of the late 
Gen. Moshe Dayan, says it is necessary to maintain contacts with the 
Palestinian leadership, despite the anger at the Palestinian support for 
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be thinking about the morning after this crisis," she said in Tel 
Aviv. "The Palestinians will still be here, and we will have to have a 
dialogue. I think it is a tremendous mistake to stop talking to them. Sure, we 
disagree with them on more things than we agree on, but disagreement is a form 
of dialogue. We have eventually to cooperate with Palestinians. We have no 
other choice." 
</P>
<P>
But others involved in the peace process have changed their emphasis in the 
face of the Palestinians' support for President Hussein. Yossi Sarid of the 
Citizens Rights Movement declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I personally do not feel the need for meetings with Palestinians now. I feel 
as if a lot of wires have been cut, and it will take time until I feel a need 
for meetings of this type. I think we are talking about such a deep 
misunderstanding that I do not see us on the same platform in the near future. 
This is a wound that will take a long time to heal." 
</P>
<P>
Eleazar Granot, chairman of Mapam, the United Workers Party, said the PLO, by 
supporting Iraq, "has placed a serious question mark over whether it will 
represent the Palestinian nation in future negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian response is unfortunate," he went on. "They are pinning the 
fate of the Palestinian nation on the success or failure of this man." 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, a Knesset member for the Shinui Party, said the 
Palestinians' action was "political stupidity, since their stand ensures that 
the start of talks about peace is further off." 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein argued that the PLO's position on Iraq does not alter the need "to 
find a settlement with the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot swallow them up, we cannot digest them, and we cannot expel them," 
he said. "Within a short time, the Palestinians will discover that all their 
dreams and all Saddam Hussein's rantings are worth nothing." 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Citizens Rights Movement, Knesset member Dedi Zucker, said: 
"Even the grave mistake made by the Palestinians now is not enough to move me 
from my basic position, that our basic interest demands the separate 
development of two nations, separation and the erection of a demilitarized 
Palestinian state next to Israel. But you have to be an idiot not to understand 
that the Israeli public will be less sensitive to this issue in the near 
future." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli press has given prominent play to statements by liberal Jewish 
Americans such as Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School and Menachem 
Rosensaft, who met with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, saying they were 
re-examining their pro-Palestinian positions because of the PLO stand on the 
Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, peace supporters such as Dayan and Goldblum insist that the very 
pro-Iraqi stance of the Palestinians is evidence that the peace process is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Had there been peace talks under way in Cairo," Goldblum said, "Israel 
couldn't have been cast as a villain by Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Goldblum said, "the peace camp in Israel is not going to sleep. 
We have to keep active, if not in talking to Palestinians then in watching 
where (Israeli) settlements go in the occupied territories and in reducing Arab 
hostility toward us."

BUSH FORMALLY WARNS OF BUDGET CUTS ON OCT. 1; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: NOTIFICATION OF GRAMM-RUDMAN SLASHES PUTS PRESSURE ON NEGOTIATORS. 
ANALYSTS SEE THE MOVE AS SYMBOLIC.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration formally served notice that it will have to impose 
mandatory budget cuts in many key federal programs starting Oct. 1 unless White 
House and congressional negotiators reach agreement on a budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Management and Budget warned that, in order to avoid such cuts, 
the budget deficit must be reduced by between $85.4 billion and $105.7 billion 
-- a figure that is $35 billion to $55 billion more than negotiators have 
publicly said is politically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to sign a cutback order Saturday that will direct federal 
agencies to begin preparing for the mandated reductions. The action would not 
affect Social Security and other basic entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that, at this point, the move is mainly symbolic. In reality, both 
the budget negotiators and Congress have plenty of room to maneuver if they 
decide to cut spending further, raise taxes or simply abandon the targets set 
by the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
But the action intensifies pressure on the negotiators, who already are being 
faced with soaring costs stemming from the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The White House warnings were bolstered by a companion report compiled by the 
Congressional Budget Office showing that a cut of $101.2 billion is required to 
meet the Gramm-Rudman target, which calls for reducing the deficit to $64 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's report by OMB provided a detailed analysis of how spending will be 
reduced in each government department; it calls for cuts of 32.4% in 
non-defense programs and 35.3% in military spending, excluding personnel costs. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush earlier exempted personnel costs from the Gramm-Rudman automatic 
cuts in order to avoid putting spending pressures on the Pentagon's deployment 
of troops to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
If the automatic cuts reached the maximum $105.7-billion level, about $52.8 
billion would be slashed from non-exempted defense programs, and $52.8 billion 
would be cut from the scant 28% of domestic programs that are not exempt from 
the required reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The $85.4-billion figure represents the cutbacks that would be needed from 
appropriations already passed by Congress. The higher figure of $105.7 billion 
reflects what the total would be if the lawmakers provided full funding for all 
the programs they have authorized. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, 72% of total government spending, including Social Security 
benefits, would be exempted from mandatory cuts. Medicare benefits could be 
reduced by up to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Director Richard G. Darman said the Administration hopes to avoid 
imposition of automatic cuts, but he again criticized Congress for failing to 
work with the White House to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent responsible congressional action, sequester (the automatic cuts) will 
go into effect -- as required by law," Darman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
But other Administration officials and congressional staff members said that 
the budget-cutting threat was mostly symbolic, because the increased cost of 
coping with the Middle East crisis has forced both the White House and Congress 
to rethink their budget projections. 
</P>
<P>
White House and congressional negotiators have agreed that the deficit should 
only be reduced by $50 billion in 1991, effectively diluting the official 
Gramm-Rudman targets. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts say the combination of the U.S. military deployment 
in Saudi Arabia and the impact of higher oil prices stemming from Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait now will make even that lower deficit-reduction figure more 
difficult to attain. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional staff members said the crisis may force Congress to find a way to 
circumvent the Gramm-Rudman process in September, perhaps by altering the 
budget targets, in order to give the government breathing room during the 
confrontation with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress were to change -- or temporarily suspend -- the Gramm-Rudman 
targets, the automatic cutbacks would not be required. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), one of the authors of the Gramm-Rudman legislation, 
conceded Monday in an interview that the lawmakers most likely would take some 
action to rescind the cuts once they went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"No one contemplates keeping these kinds of (mandated) cuts in place for a 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm conceded that the whole budget-cutting debate will be thrown out if 
"shooting starts" in the Middle East. "Then the (automatic budget cuts) stop 
being a credible threat to Congress, and people who oppose them will use that 
to find a way around them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even if Congress takes no action before Oct. 1, the effect of Saturday's 
presidential budget-cutting order would still be limited if a new budget 
agreement can be hammered out by Oct. 15, the final deadline under the current 
Gramm-Rudman process. 
</P>
<P>
If an accord were reached by then, federal agencies would be able to avoid 
layoffs and other cost-cutting measures by using funds allocated for the rest 
of the year, thus making up for any loss of funds in early October, budget 
experts said.

24 STATES PRESS FOR PUNISHING OIL COMPANIES THAT RIG PRICES

Attorneys general from 24 states met Monday in an effort to pressure the 
Administration to punish oil companies found to have rigged prices as a result 
of the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys general, joined by representatives from 12 other states, compared 
notes on state price-gouging antitrust legislation and the sharp jump in oil 
prices that occurred after Iraq invaded Kuwait this month and oil from the two 
countries was embargoed. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Atty. Gen. Lacy H. Thornburg urged the federal government to 
study the entire oil industry to determine why retail gasoline prices have 
jumped 20 cents to 30 cents a gallon in many parts of the country. The oil 
industry, he said, "has yet to demonstrate that a single gallon of oil has been 
denied these shores." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush last week urged oil companies to hold down costs to consumers, 
and several companies temporarily complied. 
</P>
<P>
"Our citizens are shocked," said Florida Atty. Gen. Robert Butterworth. "They 
believe oil companies are gouging them." 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth said Florida had subpoenaed 16 major oil companies to determine if 
price-fixing was occurring. New York is issuing subpoenas to retail service 
stations charging particularly high prices, and North Carolina has taken Exxon 
to court on suspicion of retroactive pricing. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys general met representatives of oil and consumer groups and held 
discussions with Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust 
officials.

COSTS FOR FOOD STAMPS, WELFARE JUMP SHARPLY

A large jump in the number of people eligible for food stamps and welfare 
benefits this year is costing states and the federal government billions of 
dollars, a published report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, with some rising 50%, 
said an Agriculture Department report quoted in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people receiving food stamps rose by 1.3 million from May, 1989, 
to May, 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first time since 1985, said the 
report, which was submitted to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The department, which administers the food stamp program, noted that food stamp 
rolls have risen 16% in the last year in Texas, 19% in Florida, 26% in Nevada, 
54% in New Hampshire, 12% each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7% each in New 
York state and California, and 21% in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Congress appropriated $14.8 billion, but that proved inadequate and it had to 
provide an additional $1.2 billion in May. It then directed the Agriculture 
Department to investigate the causes. 
</P>
<P>
The department report said that "44 states and the District of Columbia 
experienced a growth in participation" in the food stamp program over the last 
year, while the nation's unemployment rate was relatively stable.

Stephen E. Smith, brother-in-law and campaign manager of President John F. 
Kennedy, has died at his Manhattan home after what a Kennedy family spokesman 
described only as a long illness. He was 62 when he died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the husband of Jean Kennedy Smith and a financial analyst, managed 
Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and served as adviser to members of 
America's most famous family. He also aided the development in Boston of the 
John F. Kennedy Library. 
</P>
<P>
"For 34 years, from the day he married Jean, Steve was like a brother in our 
family," said Sen. Edward M. (Ted) Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was with Smith when 
he died. "He was the wisest adviser and the most skillful campaign manager and 
the best friend that any of us ever had. 
</P>
<P>
"There wouldn't have been a Camelot without Steve Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also managed the Senate campaigns of Edward Kennedy and his assassinated 
brother, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife, Smith is survived by two sons and two daughters, all of whom 
were with him at his death.

JOSEPH B. CAMPBELL; STATE JUDGE PRESIDED IN SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph B. Campbell, presiding judge of the 4th District Court of Appeal based 
in San Bernardino, has died. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who lived in Victorville, died Friday at St. Mary's Desert Valley 
Hospital in Apple Valley after a long bout with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had served on the appellate bench since 1986 and had been a judge of 
the San Bernardino County Superior Court from 1972 until his appellate 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
He frequently amused his colleagues by reciting poems about how judges should 
behave on the bench. A favorite admonition began, "Don't go to sleep, don't go 
to sleep! Do not go to sleep, do not go to sleep! Do not go back to sleep. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
While operating a law office in Victorville, Campbell also served from 1962 to 
1972 as a Victorville city councilman and was chosen by the council to be mayor 
for three terms. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is survived by his wife, Donna, three sons, four grandchildren, a 
sister and a niece. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for 10 a.m. today at Kemper Campbell Ranch in 
Victorville, with interment in Victor Valley Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the Oro Grande 
Foundation, St. Mary's Desert Hospital or Desert Hospice in Victorville.

<P>
James T. Foley, the longest-serving federal judge in the country, has died in 
Albany, N.Y. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
He died Friday of a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Foley was first appointed to the bench on Feb. 16, 1949, by President Harry S. 
Truman, and his judicial career lasted more than 40 years. Serving on the U.S. 
District Court for northern New York, which is based in Albany, Foley was the 
court's chief judge from 1963 to 1980. After his official retirement on July 1, 
1980, he assumed senior judge status, hearing special cases. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress authorized the renaming of Albany's federal courthouse in the 
judge's honor. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Eleanor, and a daughter.

RICHARD L. STROUT; COVERED POLITICAL SCENE FOR 60 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard L. Strout, the venerable journalist who began covering presidential 
press conferences when Warren G. Harding would show up in golf knickers and was 
on hand as they evolved into the stylized, televised spectaculars of the Ronald 
Reagan White House, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Strout, who reported for the Christian Science Monitor for more than 60 years 
while also writing the political column "TRB From Washington" in the New 
Republic magazine from 1943 to 1983, was 92 when he died Sunday night at 
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Sperling, a longtime colleague at the Monitor, told the Associated 
Press that Strout had been hospitalized after a fall on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most revered members of the nation's press corps, Strout was 
esteemed by colleagues and readers alike for his biting insight and historical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
He personally liked Harding, he said shortly before retiring. He said of former 
President Jimmy Carter, "Poor old Carter, who didn't know the game rules when 
he came here." And he considered Franklin D. Roosevelt the most effective of 
all the 12 Presidents he had covered. 
</P>
<P>
Under Strout, the TRB column became one of the most widely echoed sources of 
liberal political opinion in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
When he gave it up, the New Republic's editors observed, "You don't get out of 
Strout's church without hearing the sermon, but the hymns are lovely. . . . He 
looks and listens, and tells you what he has seen and heard in vivid, simple 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Strout described the Eisenhower Administration as "government by sedative" and 
likened Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.) to "a mist that carries lethal 
contagion." 
</P>
<P>
Of Richard M. Nixon, then vice president, he wrote in 1958, "He is out for the 
kill and the scalp at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, his name remained on the magazine's masthead as a 
contributing editor. Like his predecessors, Strout wrote the column in 
anonymity but in recent years it has been signed, currently by senior editor 
Michael Kinsley. 
</P>
<P>
The name TRB was coined by Bruce Bliven, an editor of the magazine before it 
moved from New York to Washington. Bliven, who carried his copy to the office 
by subway, said the initials stood for Brooklyn Rapid Transit in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
On his 80th birthday in 1978, Strout, still active, said, "If you live long 
enough, people confuse ability with longevity. I'm just an analytical writer 
with some color. I'm not a whiz-bang." 
</P>
<P>
The same year, he was given a special citation by the Pulitzer Prize committee 
for his lifetime achievement. Strout also won the George Polk Memorial Award in 
1958 and the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award in 1975, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Strout was raised in Brooklyn by a father who taught English and wrote poetry. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Harvard in 1919 and then worked his way across the Atlantic 
on a grain ship. He reported for two years for a paper in Sheffield, England, 
and returned to the United States where he was hired by the Boston Post before 
joining the Monitor in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
His assignments ranged from the Teapot Dome scandal in the Harding 
Administration to presidential political conventions and campaigns to 
Roosevelt's New Deal efforts to deal with the Depression and on through the 
Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Strout gradually became critical of the American electoral process, citing the 
ongoing decay in voter turnout, which he laid to disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
He advocated adaptation of the parliamentary system of government used in 
Britain and Canada but acknowledged that "the Founding Fathers tied us up so we 
can't change." 
</P>
<P>
In his final column, in April, 1983, Strout reflected on the divergences he had 
witnessed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes think," he wrote, "that you can measure the passage of time by 
counting the things that couldn't happen. A Roman Catholic couldn't be elected 
President. Schools couldn't be desegregated. Government couldn't expand budgets 
in a depression. Birth control couldn't be discussed in terms of national 
policy. Public welfare was 'socialism.' American troops couldn't be stationed 
in Europe in peacetime. We couldn't lose a war." 
</P>
<P>
As for democracy itself, Strout quoted E. B. White: 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half the people are right 
more than half the time."

BOARD BACKS PROPOSALS FOR AUTONOMY AT 27 SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WAIVERS ARE GRANTED FROM DISTRICTWIDE POLICIES. SCHOOLS MUST SHOW 
IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT WITHIN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a heated session, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted 6 to 1 on 
Monday to approve proposals to give 27 schools more autonomy and allow them to 
operate outside of formal district policies. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed a lengthy debate about whether the board should grant all 27 
schools waivers of district policies when many of their restructuring plans 
appear to fall short of the goal of raising student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that a school granted a waiver will do something strange," said 
board member Mark Slavkin. "But I think it's important that we approve this and 
move forward. The world is watching and testing our commitment" to the school 
restructuring process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waivers are required when the proposals conflict with district requirements, 
such as changing staff evaluations and graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The school-based management concept was approved by the school board and 
teachers union as part of the settlement of last year's teachers strike. It 
allows councils of teachers, parents and administrators at all of the 
district's 600 schools to gradually assume responsibility for the school's 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The initial restructuring proposals were criticized by some board members for 
not going far enough to meet students' needs. In accepting the plans on Monday, 
the board required all 27 schools to document by next year increases in student 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Although district staff members expressed concern about many of the waivers 
requested, the board agreed to approve all except those that Supt. William 
Anton and teachers union President Helen Bernstein feel might negatively affect 
other schools or require additional funding. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a rocky one for Anton, who has enjoyed a honeymoon with the 
board since his appointment in July. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting's outset, he asked the board to allow him to study the waiver 
requests and postpone a decision. But about an hour before the board was to 
vote, he changed his recommendation and asked for immediate approval. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members criticized the hasty way he presented the report and his 
apparent change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just all wrong," said a visibly angry board member, Roberta Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Anton admitted that the flip-flop was a "cardinal sin," but said he 
changed his mind and ask for immediate approval to "speed up the process" and 
to send schools seeking to implement their restructuring plans this fall a 
message that the district supports the concept. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, if they accomplish what we all want -- higher student achievement 
-- I will approve this report," said board member Leticia Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
Only board member Rita Walters voted against approval of the plans, contending 
that the board needed more time to study the waiver requests. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, district officials unveiled a plan to help schools avoid some 
of the chaos caused by student overcrowding last year. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 17,000 new students are expected to show up this fall to enroll in 
schools that have no classroom space for them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year, when officials had to hustle after school had started to find 
room at other schools for more than 15,000 new students, the district has 
already located enough classroom seats for this year's anticipated new 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the district was hit by an unexpected influx of students -- most of 
them Spanish-speaking -- in its most crowded schools. More than 25,000 of those 
youngsters had to be bused to less-crowded suburban campuses, even though many 
of those schools did not have enough teachers, supplies or bilingual aides to 
accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
Because of delays finding space for the students, many arrived at their new 
schools late in the semester, disrupting established classrooms and sending 
droves of suburban parents to complain at school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
This year, bus routes have been changed to minimize travel time for the bused 
students, and stronger relationships have been established between sending and 
receiving schools, said Ted Alexander, head of the district's integration 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, schools that receive bused students will get at least $225 per 
year per student -- up from $50 last year -- to fund programs, buy supplies and 
hire aides for the new pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowded schools, which have traditionally received no additional funding, 
will get at least $47 for each student they bus to pay for such costs as 
clerical support and bus stop monitors. 
</P>
<P>
The funding will allow schools to better plan for the new arrivals and avoid 
many of the haphazard arrangements that took place last year, Alexander said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BILL TO SPEED CITYHOOD PASSED BY ASSEMBLY 
65-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a boost for Malibu cityhood, the state Assembly on Monday approved by a 65-0 
vote legislation intended to speed up the community's incorporation. The bill 
was sent to the Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Even though voters in June overwhelmingly approved cityhood for the coastal 
community, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors delayed until March the 
effective date of incorporation so work on a controversial sewer project could 
begin. The board's maneuver would prevent a new Malibu city council from 
blocking the project. 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature, cityhood supporters have been pushing a measure sponsored 
by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that, if passed by the Senate and signed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian, would short-circuit the county's plans by allowing the 
incorporation to take effect immediately.

HIGH-TECH FACE-OFF AT FRYMAN CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: ENVIRONMENTALISTS PACKING CELLULAR PHONES HEAD OFF THE EARTH 
MOVERS. CITY ORDER PREVENTS CONSTRUCTION TRAILER FROM ENTERING AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Daryce Richman-Cooper's Mercedes-Benz 380 SEC, personalized license plate, "I 
SING D," was the unlikely battlewagon Monday in an inconclusive but very modern 
test of wills between environmentalists and the would-be developer of woodsy 
Fryman Canyon in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene that might have been scripted by Woody Allen at his ironic best, 
Richman-Cooper parked her cream-colored Mercedes to block the entrance to the 
scenic canyon, then sat punching numbers into her car phone to try to get some 
action from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Whose car is this? We've got to get in here," harrumphed John Bergsma, a 
burly, cigar-chomping contractor, when he arrived in his pickup truck at 7:30 
a.m. to begin preparing the site for construction. 
</P>
<P>
But Richman-Cooper, an actress and studio backup singer whose battle gear was a 
hot-pink jumpsuit and matching running shoes, refused to budge until city 
officials arrived and ordered Bergsma not to begin work. It was the latest 
skirmish between a thin green line of Hollywood environmentalists and Bergsma's 
boss, developer Fred Sahadi, who proposes to build a 26-home project on a 
63-acre site in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, the city has been maneuvering to secure the canyon as parkland and 
to declare the site a cultural heritage monument. But after the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy's offer to buy the land for $8.7 million was rejected as 
too low last month by Sahadi, the stage was set for a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
In circuitous fashion, environmentalists had learned that the developer might 
send in workers Monday. Police had met with Sahadi on Friday, when he alerted 
them that environmentalists might try to interfere with his workers. Police 
tipped off Councilman Michael Woo's office, which tipped off the 
preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation stalemated Monday morning, the adversaries -- in true 
late-20th Century L.A.-style -- retreated to their mobile phones to summon 
allies, lawyers, City Hall aides and police to come to their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Between hurried phone calls, Bergsma and the environmentalists filmed and 
photographed each other and exchanged hot words. 
</P>
<P>
"You're destroying a canyon that can't be replaced, trees that are precious," 
said an environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you live in a house? And what do you think your house is made of? 
Trees," replied Bergsma. 
</P>
<P>
At times it got ugly: 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm just trying to do my job," Bergsma complained. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the excuse that's always used by soldiers committing atrocities," 
yelled Debra Denker from behind a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, this is an atrocity against Mother Nature," shouted one of the 
protesters. After huddled consultations among police, Sahadi's representatives 
and environmentalists, Richman-Cooper agreed to move her car -- but only after 
a Building and Safety official waved a pink piece of paper at Bergsma -- an 
Order To Comply -- and warned that he would be cited if he put in a 
construction trailer and strung electrical and phone wires to it. Ben Reznik, 
Sahadi's attorney, said he believes Bergsma has the authority to do so, but the 
city contended he did not have appropriate permits. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Struve, the building inspector, was greeted as a savior by the 
environmentalists. "You could be elected mayor," shouted Judy Marx, a leader of 
the Urban Wilderness Coalition, formed to protect Fryman Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
After the dust settled, Richman-Cooper said she thought protesters had won a 
small victory in their fight -- now in its fifth month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would've put the construction trailer on the site if we hadn't 
been there today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richman-Cooper also theorized that Bergsma's presence at the canyon Monday 
would pressure City Hall politicians anew to raise the offer to buy out Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he may be pulling our strings to get the city to move," she said. Last 
Friday, when Woo was told of Sahadi's plans to start work, he agreed: "I think 
he's just trying to raise the stakes." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Reznik said his client's effort to begin work in the canyon is not 
"a joke -- we're not just trying to make noise." 
</P>
<P>
"If this incident gets the city to move on finding additional money to buy 
Fryman, that's only a side result of what we're doing," Reznik said. "We just 
can't sit idly by."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOCUS ON FAMILY FOUNDER SUFFERS HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James C. Dobson, who founded the Christian media empire Focus on the Family, 
has been hospitalized after suffering what officials of his organization called 
a "mild to moderate" heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Paul L. Hetrick, vice president of the nonprofit, Pomona-based Focus on the 
Family, said Dobson, 54, will remain at a Pasadena hospital for tests until the 
end of the week. Dobson, who regularly plays basketball with friends, 
experienced chest pains during a game and drove himself to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson is the author of 11 books on family living and host of a radio program 
heard on 1,450 stations.

'SKY BUMS' GIVE THEMSELVES A LOFTY GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME PREVENTION: HANG GLIDERS WILL TRY TO PHOTOGRAPH ARSONISTS AND OTHER 
LAWBREAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To join the Southland's newest crime watch group, you have to jump off a 
mountain, soar through the air and operate a camera thousands of feet above the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
That's no problem for "sky bums" from the Sylmar Hang Gliding Assn., who have 
launched their anti-crime effort in the skies above Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 200 aerial snitches say they frequently see illegal dumping and 
maverick skeet shooters and a lot of parked cars with no apparent purpose in 
the San Gabriel Mountains above Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see couches and stoves dumped up here because it's such a beautiful 
area," Robert Laukka, 28, of Thousand Oaks said Friday as he prepared to leap 
off wind-swept Kagel Mountain, his sleuthing camera strapped to the frame of 
his glider. 
</P>
<P>
Brush fires in the forest are common, and they create an inconvenience for hang 
gliders because the National Park Service usually shuts down launch pads near 
the fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching out for arsonists will save us sky bums a lot of grief," said Bob 
Lafay, 56, of Tujunga, who made his 1,217th hang-gliding flight from Kagel 
Mountain on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hang gliders decided to capitalize on their bird's-eye view in the hopes 
that their presence will deter criminals from such activities as dumping stolen 
cars over the sides of cliffs and shooting guns illegally in the forest, said 
Rome Dodson, spokesman for the Sylmar association. Last week, three men in a 
white pickup truck were observed shooting at an abandoned car by the side of 
the 2 1/2-mile dirt road leading to the launch site. 
</P>
<P>
"If our watch stops one person from doing something wrong, it will be worth 
it," Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and law enforcement officers said the idea of such a group is, 
well, lofty. With lightweight, disposable cameras, the snoops will swoop as 
close as 10 feet -- when wind conditions allow -- to photograph cars in 
isolated spots. 
</P>
<P>
The hang gliders will keep records of the vehicles that they see, and, in the 
event of fires, will report the information to rangers or the police on 
hand-held radios or telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think it is a very good idea," said Jim Sanchez, chief of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department's air operations. "Whatever these folks can do, 
we appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three fires have burned this summer in the 690,000-acre Angeles National 
Forest, which stretches from the Sylmar area to San Bernardino, said Jim Stump, 
deputy fire management officer for the forest. Twenty were started by 
arsonists, none of whom were apprehended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bad year in terms of number of fires started, but we've been lucky 
only 1,735 acres have burned," Stump said. "Every little bit the hang gliders 
can do helps." 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Chief Paul Blackburn, head of the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department's Prevention and Conservation Bureau, warned that like any crime 
watch group, the hang gliders need guidance from law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"They need direction," Blackburn said. "Some of those arsonists may be 
dangerous, so they shouldn't try to catch anyone themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Sylmar club say there is no chance of that. One of the reasons 
they started the watch group, they say, is to change the image of hang gliders 
as danger-loving and foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safer than most sports," said Dodson, as he prepared to race down a ramp 
and throw himself off the side of the mountain.

CLASS AT LOCKE HIGH.

Every morning, every evening, all summer long, you can find Trisha Phillips 
running through the hilly streets of her San Pedro neighborhood. Two miles in 
the morning; two miles at night, a schedule chosen to accommodate her summer 
job and avoid the season's muggy heat. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, she expects to be running on the track team at Stanford 
University, where she will be a freshman with plans to become a pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned to be very disciplined," said the soft-spoken Phillips, who in 
June graduated first in her class at Locke High School in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Her grade point average was 4.16, boosted by high marks in the 
college-level, or "advanced placement," courses she completed in calculus ("my 
favorite subject"), English, economics and government. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the school's track and cross-country team, she was the 1989 city 
champion in the girls' 800-meter run and made it to the state finals this year. 
She also found time for playing the violin, swimming and writing, was elected 
class corresponding secretary, sang in her church choir and did volunteer work 
in the district office of Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
"We kid her a lot," said John Mandell, one of her high school counselors. "We 
tell her we keep looking for something wrong with her." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips credits her parents and older sister for encouraging her to try her 
best at whatever interested her. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, a psychologist, and her father, a chemical analyst for a firm in 
Torrance, were strict, always insisting on completed homework, thorough 
practice, strong commitment in every endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"They also always patted me on the back, and it has all helped tremendously," 
Phillips said one morning shortly before she graduated in June. "A lot of kids 
here have no parental support, and that has made me realize how important it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
She concedes that her family was stunned when, fresh out of junior high, she 
announced she wanted to leave the friends and familiar surroundings of her 
comfortable suburban community to attend high school in one of Los Angeles' 
toughest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what life was like at an inner-city school. I wanted to see if 
it was really as bad as people said, to see if there were some solutions to 
making it better," she recalled. Seeing her determination, her parents 
relented, and her mother spent the next three years driving her back and forth 
between home and school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here I got scared that I wouldn't make it, but the people 
were so cordial I soon felt I had a lot of new friends," Phillips recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there are gangs here and people have a lot of problems. But there are so 
many positives as well. People are very close. They care about each other. It's 
a real community," said Phillips, adding that the tight-knit aura extends to 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are really friendly, and the school has a lot of excellent 
teachers who have been here a long time. They really get to know the kids, and 
they really care about them. So do the administrators and counselors. They're 
like family." 
</P>
<P>
In her graduation speech, Phillips told her classmates, about half of whom are 
black and half are Latino, that they can overcome the struggles facing 
minorities by striving to excel. 
</P>
<P>
"If we unite and put our education to good use, we can rearrange society's 
views on how life for us will be," said Phillips. "Instead of messing up, we 
will fight to build up our community. . . . They will see."

BAD LUCK ON DISPLAY AT HOLOGRAM EXHIBIT HIT TWICE BY THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The curators of a Santa Monica holography exhibit say they are haunted by the 
feeling that a menacing black cloud is raining misfortune down on them at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
And who can blame them, said investigators and spectators on hand to view the 
holograms on Monday. The exhibit, part of a collection billed as the largest 
and "most significant" in the world, has been burglarized twice in the last 10 
days, to the tune of about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd better come see it before they steal the rest of it," said Steve 
Kaplan, a Santa Monica attorney viewing the "Images in Time and Space" 
collection at a Third Street Promenade gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The burglaries followed a heist last summer in which three holograms -- 
lifelike three-dimensional images captured on film with the use of a laser beam 
-- were stolen while the exhibit was on display in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, sometime within the last three weeks, $10,000 worth of 
televisions, videocassette recorders and other electronic goods used in the 
exhibit were stolen from an Inglewood warehouse, according to J. William 
McGowan, chairman of the board of Associates of Science and Technology, a 
Canadian nonprofit organization sponsoring the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
It gets worse. Just after talking to Inglewood police last Friday about the 
warehouse theft, McGowan's wallet was apparently lifted by a pickpocket. That 
same night, another group member's vintage 1963 Chevrolet Impala was stolen in 
an apparently unrelated case, along with his architecture portfolio, outside a 
Hollywood nightclub. Robert A. Amezquita said it was the second time his car 
been stolen since he joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to laugh. It is just unbelievable," McGowan said. "If anyone were to 
make up this story, people would say, 'You've got to be kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGowan, as well as other holography organization members and the local police, 
regard the thefts as anything but funny. "It is just devastating, quite 
frankly," McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday at the exhibit gallery, McGowan appealed to the 
public to help find 25 holograms that were stolen during break-ins the last two 
Sunday mornings. The entire exhibit had about 200 holograms. 
</P>
<P>
Program director Robin Scott fought back tears Monday, without success, as she 
pointed to blank spaces on the walls of the darkened gallery where the 
holograms had been ripped from their mountings. She said some, like one about 
world peace by a local artist known as Alexander, had taken months to produce, 
were worth about $15,000, and were masterpieces unlike any others in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"These artists," Scott said, "have lost pieces of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects and police are pursuing some "very limited information," 
said Lt. Robert Thomas of the Santa Monica Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility, authorities said, is that the burglaries were an inside job, 
since it appears that there was no forced entry to the building in either 
break-in. The robbers may have had keys and may have known what they wanted 
beforehand, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the works were insured, but there was "nothing to suggest any 
kind of insurance fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who is coordinating the investigation, said police are increasing their 
surveillance of the site and trying to determine why someone would steal 
holographs and where they could sell them. "We learn about art in a hurry when 
something like this happens," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they did not know whether the Santa Monica and Inglewood 
burglaries were related. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be lot of coincidences," one law enforcement official said of the 
tribulations befalling the group's members, "but if it is, we wouldn't 
recommend they buy any lottery tickets." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica exhibit and a display that opened in Pasadena this week are 
both drawn from the Associates of Science and Technology's collection of works 
by artists from 17 countries. The group uses its entire collection, valued at 
$1.5 million, to get youngsters interested in the ties between the sciences and 
the arts.

BOARD URGED TO DELAY ANY MORE CUTS IN SCHOOL BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District finance chief Robert Booker has recommended 
that the district delay any further cuts in its proposed $3.96-billion budget, 
despite state funding reductions that could cost the district $77 million in 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the budget to the school board on Monday, Booker expressed 
confidence that the state Legislature will restore the 4.76% cost-of-living 
increase that Gov. George Deukmejian slashed to 3% when he signed the state 
budget earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
That reduction cost the school district more than $40 million that it had 
anticipated spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other Deukmejian budget vetoes -- including reductions or changes in the 
funding of year-round schools, driver education training and school 
construction programs -- will cost the district an additional $37 million in 
the coming year if they are not modified, Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
Those state budget cuts come in the wake of a recently completed series of 
lengthy and painful program and personnel cuts that the Los Angeles board made 
to trim $220 million from its 1990-91 budget. Consequently, Booker has 
recommended that the board await the outcome of legislative action to overturn 
Deukmejian's cuts before slicing further into instructional programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the board and public understand, however, that . . . 
deeper reductions and more personnel cuts will be necessary" in the coming 
months if the cost-of-living allocation is not increased, Booker said.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: SAN FRANCISCO SEES ITS FUTURE AND IT'S . . . US! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old news is that San Francisco is amid a long and painful economic decline. 
The jewel of the West is tarnished; the financial capital is tattered; the 
warehouse of the Pacific is closed. Jobs have fled to Walnut Creek and 
Vacaville and other points east, north and south. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the new news? San Francisco is reinventing itself economically, and 
it's beginning to look like . . . Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's now called the Bay Area economy, thank you very much, and it's doing quite 
well. So what if San Francisco's population isn't growing? The Bay Area (which 
economists and planners say includes 10 or 11 counties, depending on who is 
counting) is the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan region, with 6 million 
inhabitants. Bigger than Philadelphia, to use a comparison that a few years ago 
would have drawn groans here. 
</P>
<P>
So what if San Francisco's job growth has been insignificant and the city has 
been losing employers? Regional unemployment is very low, personal income is 
very high and the outlook is good, all things considered. "Well-positioned," as 
the economists say, to weather even a recession, if we have one. 
</P>
<P>
Just as in Los Angeles, people here use the name San Francisco to apply to the 
much larger regional economy. And, also just as in Los Angeles, people who have 
moved their jobs and homes out of the city often view what remains with 
distaste, even though they must admit that the region's economic heart is still 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Sprawling, low-slung industrial and commercial parks in a dozen locations 
around the bay house many of the retailers, warehouses, data processing 
operations and manufacturers that used to be located in the city of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
People in two-income households work at jobs from San Jose to San Rafael to 
afford the astronomical mortgages on their homes in Mill Valley or Mountain 
View. More and more people are moving as far away as Modesto, a two-hour 
commute, to find an affordable new house. And they fight traffic on outmoded 
freeways and transit systems designed to get people into San Francisco, not to 
a half dozen population and economic hot spots spread across a sprawling 
megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
Hear an echo? 
</P>
<P>
What's more, over the past 20 years the job patterns in the Bay Area have been 
startlingly similar to those in Southern California. A decline in government 
and better-paying manufacturing jobs has coincided with a huge increase in 
professional, retail, service and low-wage manufacturing jobs. Meantime, both 
economies have experienced explosive growth in the creation of small 
businesses, many started by new immigrants or laid-off corporate workers. 
</P>
<P>
And both places have experienced the flight of middle-wage jobs from the 
central business districts to the suburbs, leaving behind a core of high-paid 
professionals and corporate chieftains, and an army of homeless and unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
This Los Angeles-izing of San Francisco, once so strongly denied, is now 
grudgingly admitted here. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is, we have the bay, which acts as a blue belt to limit 
sprawl, and you don't," said Mike McGill, executive director of the Bay Area 
Economic Forum, a nonprofit group that is studying ways to improve regional 
economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The creation during the past five years of McGill's organization and others, 
such as Bay Vision 2020, a regional planning group, speaks volumes about growth 
of the Bay Area outside San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
For the city itself, the wounds caused by this shift have been damaging and 
have not healed. "It takes a period of mental adjustment to recognize that 
you're the core city of a region, not a separate economy," said Eunice Elton, 
president of the San Francisco Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the city formed the San Francisco Economic Development Corp. to 
promote its economy. It's about to begin something that earlier-day San 
Franciscans would have haughtily disdained: an image campaign to promote the 
local economy, a campaign that Hollywood itself would be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the campaign begins with a 60-page, four-color brochure that extols 
San Francisco as the cultural and professional heart of the rich and growing 
Bay Area. That will be followed with image advertising in major national 
business publications. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000 campaign is the brainchild of former bank regulator Kent O. Sims, 
president of the Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has been used to thinking of itself as the Bay Area," Sims said. "It 
is a difficult repositioning for us." 
</P>
<P>
What the campaign intends to do is tout San Francisco's reputation as a 
creative, innovative place with a strong tradition in developing technology and 
new products. 
</P>
<P>
What it won't do is tout the city of San Francisco as a dominant, independent 
economic entity that competes with its big neighbor to the south for business. 
The city is the region's professional core, Sims said. It's where the lawyers, 
consultants, accountants and marketing people are. It's the home of the artists 
and the intellectuals. And it's where the wholesale trade in everything from 
home decor to apparel congregates. 
</P>
<P>
Hear another echo? The same could be said of Los Angeles' role in the Southern 
California economy. 
</P>
<P>
That San Francisco is willing to advertise that it understands its changed role 
in the region is a sign both of how bad things became here economically and of 
how good things may be becoming. But it's ironic that San Francisco now 
advertises, at least implicitly, that its economic future looks so much like 
that of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The cold wind howling down Market Street seems colder these days because of the 
poverty, the homelessness, the panhandlers and the noticeably smaller number of 
office workers rushing into skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
And, as on Spring Street or Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, it's hard to tell 
those left behind that the future is in the suburbs.

</P>
<P>
UPS also failed to record the number of lost workdays caused by the injuries, 
the agency said. OSHA said the alleged violations took place at the company's

Louis-based company for the past two years. It calls for the company to 
undertake a 23.5-for-1 reverse stock split of Interco's roughly 38.7 million 
shares of common stock, issue 98 million new shares of stock and take on $202 
million in new debt.

FIRST INTERSTATE SUSPENDS STOCK DISCOUNT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp on Monday suspended a key part of its dividend 
reinvestment program for shareholders because its stock price is too depressed. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based banking firm, parent of First Interstate Bank of 
California, had offered shareholders a chance each quarter to buy its stock at 
a 2.5% discount using their quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
It provided an inexpensive way for First Interstate Bank to replenish its 
capital, which is its buffer against losses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, First Interstate had offered shareholders an opportunity to buy 
additional stock at a discount of up to $3 for each share they already owned. 
Someone with 1,000 shares, for example, could buy additional stock at a 
discount of up to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
In suspending part of the program, First Interstate said that allowing 
stockholders to buy shares at the discount while the stock is trading at its 
current low price would dilute the shares held by those who cannot participate 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's stock ended the day at $28.875 a share, off 50 cents, in New 
York Stock Exchange trading. That is just a shade above its three-year low of 
$28.50 a share and less than half the level at which it was trading one year 
ago. The stock is also trading at about $9 below its book value, or net worth, 
of $37.81 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Most bank stocks have suffered in recent weeks because of concerns about the 
economy and worries about the health of bank real estate loans. First 
Interstate's stock in particular has suffered in the wake of a $124.5-million 
loss last year caused mainly by problems in its Texas and Arizona units.

Judge Postpones Keating Decision: Citing a "strong possibility of resolution" 
between the government and attorneys for Charles H. Keating Jr., former chief 
of failed Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, U.S. District Judge Stephen 
V. Wilson delayed ruling on a Justice Department suit that would require 
Keating to disclose his assets. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wilson gave attorneys for both sides until Wednesday to reach a 
settlement in the case. The Justice Department, seeking to enforce an Office of 
Thrift Supervision order, Friday filed suit against Keating, seeking the 
disclosure and a partial freeze of his assets. Wilson also rejected a motion by 
Keating's attorneys to transfer the case to Phoenix.

JUDGE UNSEALS DOCUMENT LISTING NORTHROP PROBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 counts of defense fraud and paid 
a $17-million fine, at least one question was left unanswered: What 
investigations against Northrop were dropped as part of its plea agreement with 
federal prosecutors? 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, those investigations became public. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer unsealed most of an exhibit listing 11 
criminal investigations that were dropped against the Los Angeles aerospace 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal had sought to 
make documents in the case public. The exhibit unsealed Monday, however, does 
leave a portion whited out -- one referring to a current investigation or 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, lead prosecutor in the case, said Monday 
that "Each and every one of the investigations we chose not to go forward on 
criminally had been thoroughly investigated by more than 20 agents as well as 
several experienced federal prosecutors who spent upwards of three years 
looking at these cases. It was only at that point that we learned in some 
respects that many of the cases were beyond the statute of limitations, and 
many others had no evidence of criminal fraud." 
</P>
<P>
He said "a number of other cases" are pending against Northrop civilly and 
administratively as well as criminal probes. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Northrop pleaded guilty to fraud in connection with the cruise 
missile and Harrier jet programs. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations prosecutors dropped were: 
</P>
<P>
* Two separate cases arising from allegations made by former Northrop employees 
Jeff Kroll and David Peterson in connection with the MX missile system. The 
government has sued Northrop over some of Peterson's and Kroll's charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations concerning mischarging in 1983 in the production of the "inertial 
measurement unit," a guidance component of the MX missile. Fahey said the 
statute of limitations passed when the investigation began in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* Two investigations of mischarging at the Electronics Division, one involving 
alleged failure to properly test the "heat exchanger" of the inertial 
measurement unit. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations that Northrop failed to tell the government about a cost-saving 
new process to make parts for the FA-18 fighter. The government has filed a 
civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations contained in a Defense Contract Audit Agency report from Dec. 18, 
1987, regarding two secret programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations concerning pricing misconduct in the production of a research 
report by the B-2 Division. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations of mischarging in the B-2 and Aircraft divisions. The last three 
probes were undertaken after the statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations arising from a "whistle blower suit" brought by six former 
Northrop employees in connection with the MX missile program. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations of fraud in developing a "small ICBM." Fahey cited insufficient 
evidence of criminal misconduct.

$71-MILLION RESTITUTION SET IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal court judge Monday imposed a 15-year prison sentence on 
David A. Feldman of Palos Verdes, convicted of a massive bank fraud, and 
ordered him to pay $70.7 million in restitution to Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said they believed that the restitution award is the 
largest imposed in a bank fraud case. It was unclear, however, whether Feldman 
has the resources to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran M. Tevrizian imposed the stiff sentence on Feldman, 
50, who was convicted of three counts of felony mail fraud in June. 
</P>
<P>
The judge issued stinging criticism of Feldman, who graduated near the top of 
his class at West Point. "The only thing he has demonstrated to me is that he 
has no conscience," Tevrizian said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman and two others were indicted in May, 1989, in connection with a scheme 
to sell more than $144 million in mortgage loans to 20 banks and savings and 
loans, all of which operate outside California. Feldman controlled National 
Mortgage Equity Corp., which allegedly made false representations and concealed 
material facts in selling mortgage-backed securities to financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman assured financial institutions their investments were protected against 
defaults in various ways, including independent underwriting of borrowers' 
ability to pay and of the value of the real property securing the loans. 
However, Feldman and his co-defendants concealed the fact that there was no 
independent underwriting because the brokers, insurance firms and borrowers all 
were controlled by the same persons. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, according to court documents, diverted millions in investor funds 
through fictitious borrowers to a bonding firm, Glacier General Assurance, to 
enable it to pay off its obligations on prior defaulted loans. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman also used NMEC investors' money to purchase apartment complexes in 
Houston for a firm owned by co-defendant Kent B. Rogers of Huntington Beach. 
Prosecutors charged that Feldman gave Rogers $24 million of investors' money 
for construction loans without placing controls on Rogers' use of the funds to 
refurbish and convert the Texas apartments to condominiums. Rogers pleaded 
guilty and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Most investors' losses were covered by Bank of America, which acted as an 
escrow agent and trustee for all but three of the mortgage pools, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Leslie A. Swain and California Deputy Atty. Gen. Sharon 
McCaslin. The bank has sought to recover its losses through civil litigation. 
Bank senior counsel John C. Fauvre estimated the losses at $117.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian denied Feldman bail pending appeal. Prosecutors said he will spend 
the next 60 days at Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles and 
then be assigned to another prison. Prosecutors recommended that prison 
officials keep an especially close watch on Feldman, noting that he perpetrated 
some of his crimes while serving a prison term for an earlier fraud conviction.

MARKETING: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN IN SOME TELEVISION COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sure sounds like a new TV spot. The music and narration are brand-spanking 
new. To casual viewers, it could almost look like a fresh commercial, too. 
</P>
<P>
But those who look more closely at Nike's newest TV spot -- filled with 
favorite moments from past "Just Do It" commercials -- might think that they've 
seen it all before. And they're right. The commercial is basically a mishmash 
of short scenes from past Nike ads. The octogenarian jogger. The athlete in a 
wheelchair. A younger Andre Agassi. They're all there again. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it with the intention of saving money," Nike spokeswoman Liz 
Dolan said. "We did it because people keep asking us if they could see these 
scenes again." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its intent, Nike saved a bundle on the ad. Ad executives estimate that 
it costs five times more to film a new commercial than to edit used footage 
into what appears to be a new ad. In this ad, they estimate, Nike may have 
saved up to $500,000 in production costs. 
</P>
<P>
As advertisers continue to look for ways to cut costs, plenty are latching on 
to this seemingly simple formula: Make the old look new. Amusement parks, 
including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Sea World, are increasingly 
splicing scenes from old commercials and pasting them into new ones. So are 
retailers, including McDonald's, Lucky Stores, C&amp;R Clothiers and Home 
Depot, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is concerned about budgets these days," said Phil Labhart, whose Los 
Angeles production company, Labhart Production Group, has shot and re-edited 
ads for Sea World. "It costs so much to shoot a commercial that it only makes 
sense to see if you can go back, re-edit it and get a new one for a fraction of 
the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Ad executives say they are increasingly being pressured by clients to save on 
production costs. And with good reason. It is sometimes more expensive to 
produce the commercials than the TV shows on which they appear. Many 
commercials require production crews of more than 20 people -- including camera 
operators, art directors, lighting specialists, wardrobe and makeup experts. 
</P>
<P>
"The tighter times get, the more clients expect this sort of thing," said Miles 
Turpin, chairman of Grey Advertising's Western division, which creates ads for 
Lucky Stores. "If you spend too much on production, you're reducing the amount 
of dollars to broadcast your message." 
</P>
<P>
Grey keeps its own library of film from past Lucky commercials. It pulls out 
whatever short scenes it needs when Lucky runs promotional specials on grocery 
items such as produce. "These ads don't run very long," Turpin explained. "So 
they don't justify a big expense." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World is among the biggest users of this sort of advertising. A TV 
commercial pushing nighttime visits to Sea World that has been running in Los 
Angeles and San Diego features footage that is several years old. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have different model years of killer whales," said Tom Olson, vice 
president of marketing at San Diego-based Sea World of California. "Certainly, 
with the rise in production expenses we're anxious to use stuff we don't have 
to refilm." In fact, all four Sea World parks share commercial footage. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for Disneyland. Its current spot for the park's 35th anniversary is 
filled mostly with 2 1/2-year-old footage of its famous nighttime Electrical 
Parade. "It wouldn't make sense to spend a whole bunch of money to recreate 
that," said Henry Caroselli, director of creative services for Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the company filmed some scenes of the parade's new 35th anniversary 
float and edited it into the ad. "It's essentially the same commercial 
freshened up," Caroselli said. 
</P>
<P>
And a TV promotion that Knott's Berry Farm recently ran for Camp Snoopy was 
mostly filled with stock footage that the amusement park's agency, Davis, Ball 
&amp; Colombatto, had on hand. That probably saved $50,000 in production costs, 
said Brad Ball, president of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one believes more strongly in reusing old footage in new ads than 
Jack Roth, president of Admarketing. "I think it's something that should be 
done all the time," he said. Some commercials that Admarketing recently created 
for its client, men's store C&amp;R Clothiers, not only feature new faces but 
also scenes with several men from its old ads. 
</P>
<P>
But Roth insists that the motive wasn't just to save on production costs. One 
striking model who appeared in past ads as a weightlifter is clearly a favorite 
among viewers. "If we hadn't used his segment again," said Roth, "there 
probably would have been a backlash." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Agency Cracks Open Egg Account 
</P>
<P>
If Madison Avenue can make red meat sound healthy, why not eggs? 
</P>
<P>
The California Egg Commission awarded its $4.5-million ad account to the agency 
Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto last week. "We're going to attack the health issue 
head-on," said Brad Ball, president of the Los Angeles agency. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan "2,000-mile-old eggs" has been dumped, along with the agency that 
created it, Asher/Gould. By January, look for TV and print ads that address the 
cholesterol issue and promote healthier ways of eating eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, California egg sales need a boost. They have slipped steadily for 
the past three years, said Robert Pierre, commission president. Ball, whose 
agency also creates ads for McDonald's Operators of Southern California, thinks 
that he knows how his agency won the business. Before its presentation to the 
egg commission late last week, it served Egg McMuffins to some 20 executives. 
"I told them, if they didn't eat eggs, how could they expect the general public 
to," Ball said. Every McMuffin was gobbled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
C&amp;R to Sponsor Hunk Competition 
</P>
<P>
C&amp;R Clothiers is looking for a few good men. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in mid-September, the Culver City men's clothing chain will sponsor a 
Southern California competition for men to appear in ads. C&amp;R's commercials 
feature hunks who might be lifting weights one second, then wearing fancy suits 
the next. They do this to the tune, "What a Difference a Day Makes." The 
year-old campaign has resulted in a flood of inquiries from women who want 
their husbands, boyfriends and sons to appear in the ads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a phenomenon," said Jack Roth, president of Admarketing, the 
agency that created the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for the contest are yet to be determined -- but entry forms will be 
available at C&amp;R Clothiers stores sometime in September. Winners will 
appear in C&amp;R commercials next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, no female contestants, please. C&amp;R only sells men's fashions. Of 
course, there's always Admarketing's women's clothing client -- Clothestime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot Account Prospect on Ice Indefinitely 
</P>
<P>
The review for one of the West Coast's most sought-after pieces of advertising 
business, the $30-million New Line Cinema account, has been indefinitely 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to make any decision this year," said Sandra J. Ruch, 
president of marketing for the film company that released the hit film 
"Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles" and most recently "Metropolitan." For now, the 
media-buying account remains with New York-based Independent Media Service. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen agencies -- about half from Los Angeles -- participated in the 
review. But New Line executives have more pressing things on their minds. Last 
month, New Line moved from New York to Beverly Hills. It has since hired a 
dozen new employees in its marketing department, and it has been busy preparing 
five new films for release. 
</P>
<P>
Is the agency review dead? To that, Ruch says only, "We may not make any more 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Tahiti Revisited for L.A. Ad Agency 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing better than winning a trip to Tahiti may be winning the 
Tahiti Tourist Board's $2.5-million advertising account. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Vogel has won both. His Los Angeles agency, Vogel Communications, 
which lost the account to Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto nearly two years ago, 
has won it back and will launch a new print campaign in September. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is its recent ad slogan, "Two hours beyond Hawaii, 50 years behind it." 
That will be replaced by "A vacation of a different color," which promotes 
Tahiti's attractions by labeling them with different colors: true blue, for 
example, for the sea and sky.

Paycheck Didn't Pay: The U.S. Attorney's Office in Columbus, Ohio, filed a 
civil complaint Monday to collect more than $1.6 million in federal tax 
assessments against imprisoned country music singer Johnny Paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
The government's complaint alleges unpaid tax assessments for the years 
1980-82. Paycheck, 52, whose real name is Donald Lytle, was convicted last year 
in Highland County, Ohio, of aggravated assault and tampering with evidence in 
connection with a barroom shooting. Best known for his hit song "Take This Job 
and Shove It," Paycheck is serving a 7-to-9 1/2-year sentence in Ohio. BETH

Petitions About 'Miss Saigon': Several Asian-American activists in New York and 
Los Angeles are circulating petitions among Actors' Equity members asking for 
yet another meeting to reconsider the controversial casting of Jonathan Pryce 
in "Miss Saigon" on Broadway -- which Equity first disapproved and then 
approved -- and the issues it raises. An Equity spokeswoman said that if 
petitions with more than 100 signatures are received, "there will have to be a 
meeting" of either the union's general membership or its council. BETH KLEID

Where the Anchors Are: Bryant Gumbel is stationed in Saudi Arabia, where he 
anchors the "Today" show starting this week. He debated going to the Middle 
East versus staying in New York, then decided getting close "can't hurt." 
</P>

Ted Koppel, the first journalist to get into Iraq, went back to Washington. The 
"CBS This Morning" co-host Harry Smith left the Middle East for New York. ABC's 
Forrest Sawyer found himself in Amman, Jordan, after being booted from Baghdad. 
Dan Rather is expected to wind up in Jordan today. And amid all this movement, 
Peter Jennings stays in place at the "World News Tonight" anchor desk in New 
York. Asked if he felt a little lonely staying put: "Not at all," said 
Jennings. "I'm in exactly the right place. My job is to coordinate the 
coverage, not just go and do one dimension of it." BETH KLEID

SummerFest Artistic Director Heiichiro Ohyama proved again Sunday that inspired 
cronyism produces the strongest chamber music performances. 
</P>
<P>
At the second public concert in SummerFest '90 in Sherwood Auditorium at the 
San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art here, Ohyama, again surrounded by a 
distinguished group of gifted, high-achieving and musically affectionate 
cronies, put together a sensible -- if hardly provocative -- program consisting 
of Mozart's Piano Trio in G, K. 564, Ravel's Introduction and Allegro and 
Dvorak's Piano quartet in E-flat, Opus 87. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the character of the pieces, the evening moved steadily from 
Mozartean containment to Dvorakian climax. 
</P>
<P>
The Quartet, played passionately by a tight ensemble of obviously close 
colleagues, made all its dramatic points in a sometimes overwrought reading, 
one that might have been more effective at lower dynamic levels -- the 
acoustics in Sherwood Hall are clear enough to project even the most 
understated musical rhetoric, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with such serious artists as pianist David Golub, violinist Gyorgy Pauk, 
violist Toby Hoffman and cellist Gary Hoffmancqb, to ask for a lesser 
commitment is practically insulting. If this piece emerged almost embarrassing 
in its emotional stridency, what was needed in the first place was restraint on 
the part of the composer. 
</P>
<P>
Restraint without wimpiness marked the buoyant and articulate performance of 
the famous Ravel piece accomplished by harpist Deborah Hoffman, assisted by 
violinists Julie Rosenfeld and Cho-Liang Lin, flutist Carol Wincenc, 
clarinetist David Peck and Hoffman's brothers, violist Toby and cellist Gary. 
</P>
<P>
The second evening of the fifth SummerFest series began with an elegant but 
well-spoken account of the Mozart Trio, a reading special in its balance of 
forward thrust and relaxed lyricism, played by violinist Pauk, cellist Ronald 
Leonard and pianist Emanuel Ax. It was a reminder that the finest chamber 
performances combine personal response with selfless execution. DANIEL CARIAGA

A 'CONTEMPORARY ASSEMBLAGE' OF POLITICS, DESIRES 
</P>

A group show at L.A. Louver Gallery called "Contemporary Assemblage: The Dada 
and Surrealist Legacy" attempts to illustrate ways in which assemblage art is a 
further articulation of ideas first introduced by the dadaist and surrealists. 
Curated by Rhona Edelbaum, the show makes its point by focusing on assemblage 
that explores non-conventional materials and odd juxtapositions, the themes of 
political aggression and thwarted desire, and the use of language as a visual 
element. These things are indeed common to the three styles under 
consideration, but somehow the theory this show expounds isn't the most 
compelling thing about it. 
</P>
<P>
What really makes this exhibition worth seeing is the fact that it includes 
choice works by several excellent artists, many of whom are rarely seen in L.A. 
At the top of the list is Paul Thek, a woefully neglected American artist who 
died of AIDS in 1988 at the age of 54 (an in-depth survey of Thek's work is 
long overdue). A cranky iconoclast who made massive mixed-media installations 
(none of which were preserved for posterity, sad to say), Thek combined 
elements of pop, surrealism and the hippie philosophy of the '60s. He's 
represented here by an untitled work from 1965 made of wax, paint, shoes and a 
dead bird -- a piece that reads as a rather sad memento of what was by all 
accounts a difficult and fascinating life. 
</P>
<P>
Also noteworthy is David Mach's "The Reluctant Bride," a wacky assemblage 
comprised of a cheap knock-off of a classical statue of a female nude ensnared 
in the antlers of a stuffed deer head. This young Scottish sculptor is making a 
name for himself in Europe for his audacious use of materials (he once built a 
replica of the Parthenon from old tires), and the witty piece on view here 
leaves one anxious to see more of his work. The same is true of Annette 
Messager, a French artist who uses language and writing as central elements of 
her work. There's a weird strain of morbidity about Messager's aesthetic (she 
once dressed a bunch of dead birds in clothes she'd knit for them), but the 
piece on view here, "Mes Ouvrages," suggests her to be skillful manipulator of 
feminine motifs; needlework -- embriodery and knitting -- figures in much of 
her work, including this piece. 
</P>
<P>
The show also includes strong works by Ed and Nancy Kienholz, George Herms, 
Bruce Nauman, Robert Rauschenberg and the redoubtable Terry Allen. 
</P>
<P>
(77 Market St. Venice. to Sept. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Body Work: L.A. Louver's other space houses an exhibition of drawings by 
sculptor Peter Shelton. As with his sculpted work, the architecture of the 
human body is the launching point for Shelton's drawings which depict shells, 
skins and garments, vaguely recognizable organic fragments swollen or shrunk to 
alarming dimensions, and fantastic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bruce Nauman (who's clearly been a major influence on Shelton), Shelton is 
fascinated by the phenomenology of physical forms in space, however, he also 
has a taste for the surreal. He expresses it here in drawings of bizarre 
architectural forms that would look at home in the rustic, hallucinatory world 
of William T. Wiley; the whimsy that lurks at the edges of all Shelton's work 
takes center stage in drawings like "kettlehouse," which depicts a strange 
wooden Quonset hut perched atop a spherical structure. 
</P>
<P>
Executed in graphite on Mylar, Shelton's drawings are strongly reminiscent of 
Jasper Johns; like Johns, his touch is crisp and formal, yet moist. Shelton has 
a beautifully fluid way of drawing and his images have a loose sensuality 
that's at odds with the inexplicably horrific forms he draws.

Almarez Remembered: When Carlos Almarez died last December of AIDS, Los Angeles 
lost one of its most eloquent observers. Almarez loved and understood the 
poetry of this city remarkably well, and as a Chicano born in Mexico City and 
raised in L.A., he had a special feeling for its history. The hodgepodge of 
influences percolating in and around L.A. came together beautifully in 
Almarez's work, which combined Catholic and Hispanic motifs, references to 
European art, the iconography of low-rider car culture, Disney graphics, folk 
art and Mexican muralist techniques. Almarez synthesized these disparate 
threads into an intensely expressive style that exploded with fiery color and 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 22 years of Almarez's works on paper on view at the Jan Turner 
Gallery through Sept. 15 offers a concise view of his career. Including ink and 
graphite drawings, watercolors, monoprints and pastels, this comprehensive show 
touches on all the major stylistic shifts he experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Almarez first came into prominence in the early '70s as a muralist and founding 
member of Los Four, an aggressive collective of political artists whose work 
centered on the politics of Latino culture. Almarez's drawings from this early 
period vary quite a bit. A portrait titled "Aviator," for instance, is executed 
in a crude folk-art style that almost looks like outsider art, while other 
drawings involving flying saucers, Indian teepees, hearts pierced with daggers 
and Crayola colors are done in a faux naive child-art style. The early '70s 
also found Almarez executing spare, Picassoesque line drawings, and bright, 
buoyant portraits of L.A. street life. Like most young artists do, Almarez was 
obviously testing out various styles in search of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The look of Almarez's work continued to vary a good deal throughout his career, 
however, the feeling of his work did take consistent form fairly early on; from 
the start, a powerful anger churned through his images. Exploding with violence 
and sexuality (which he often depicted as inseparable), his work is permeated 
with the sense of the individual overwhelmed by the cacophonous symphony of 
life around him. Conjuring an apocalyptic realm of car crashes, fires and mad 
dogs, Almarez takes us into a place of frightening beauty evocative of Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez. Though much of Almarez's work is informed with the cool whimsy 
of the Pushpin Graphics style, and several of his drawings have a faint whiff 
of the wistful melancholy of Edward Hopper, his images invariably have the 
potential of erupting into a fevered dream. 
</P>
<P>
The anger that roared through Almarez's work never really went away; rather, it 
seemed to evolve into confusion and regret, and his final works found him 
turning to the themes of sin and redemption. The incandescent neon colors he 
favored throughout his career came to be muted, and where he once jam packed 
the picture plane with colors and forms, he simplified his composition 
considerably. His final drawings are less crowded and chaotic, and for the 
first time, the clean white field of the paper shines through.

BENEFIT FOR ALLEN JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Though there was an abundance of blues played Sunday at the benefit for bassist 
Allen Jackson, the mood was far from blue. The long fund-raiser, held in the 
clubhouse of the Chester Washington Golf Course and produced by vocalist Lorez 
Alexandria, was an intimate jazz party that also served as a celebration of the 
Los Angeles-based musicians who turned out on behalf of their friend and 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
The event's loose, jam-session feel made for a number of groups with 
mix-and-match personnel. Pianist Gildo Mahones took a turn with drummer Al 
Williams' Jazz Society until regular pianist Bobby Pierce arrived. Mahones was 
back at the keyboard with trumpeter Hugh Bell for a rendition of "Bye-Bye 
Blackbird," before Pierce took the piano seat again with Don and Alicia 
Cunningham. Art Hillery played with both Clora Bryant's group and with Teddy 
Edwards. Vibraphonist Raphael seemed to stand in with just about everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' two-tune set, which featured the saxophonist's slippery, thematic 
style, included a warm introduction to Walter Gross' "Tenderly" and the pushy, 
bluesy lines of Edwards' own "Get Up and Get It." Both garnered long ovations 
for the soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's most emotional moment came when Jackson, suffering from bone 
cancer, arrived and spoke briefly to the audience, thanking them for their 
support. Jackson's words, fittingly enough, were followed by a lively 
performance from the vocal team of Don and Alicia Cunningham, with whom the 
bassist once worked. BILL KOHLHAASE

DJS TAKE THEIR SHOW ON THE ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: KROQ-FM'S KEVIN RYDER AND GENE (BEAN) BAXTER WILL TREK EAST ON THEIR 
'SUMMER VACATION.' DESTINATION: NEW YORK CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
KROQ-FM (106.7) morning deejays Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter have rather 
unorthodox summer travel plans. "We've got to see the world's largest ball of 
twine," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder, 28, and Baxter, 29, started their "vacation" Monday in South Dakota and 
are heading east toward Friday's destination: New York. 
</P>
<P>
Their trek is to be filled with kitschy and obscure roadside stops, which in 
turn will be locations for remote broadcast stunts that will be aired on their 
6-10 a.m. show this week. 
</P>
<P>
The road show, costing the Burbank-based modern rock station $5,000 in airfare, 
car rentals and accommodations, will be carried live wherever the station can 
get satellite access, with the remainder broadcast through pre-recorded 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
The stops include a South Dakota shrine to "The Flintstones," known as Bedrock 
City; Tommy Bartlett's Robot World and the World's Largest Collection of 
Cathedral Organs in Wisconsin Dells, Wis.; a visit with the family of "Michael 
the Maintenance Man" Burton, the building janitor who does a daily weather rap 
on the show, and an attempted meeting with NBC late-night personality David 
Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
The "Kevin and Bean" blend of obscure sight-seeing, outrageous stunts and 
obnoxious humor is similar to the comedy of the top-rated KLOS-FM (95.5) 
morning deejay team of Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps -- something that many 
KROQ listeners, who were used to music-intensive mornings, distastefully 
pointed out when the duo premiered Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"(The station) had never done a show specifically designed to compete with the 
other stations in town," Ryder said. "A lot of people thought KROQ was selling 
out by doing that." 
</P>
<P>
"We had to throw out a lot of good ideas for shows at first because people 
would confuse them with Mark and Brian," Baxter added. "But we've developed our 
own style enough where we don't have to worry too much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In their eight months at KROQ, the deejays have broadcast from a number of 
outlandish locations, including underwater off Catalina Island's Casino Point; 
while working as sanitation engineers during a "tribute to trash;" from Camp 
Pendleton, where they fired M-16s and trained with the Marine Corps; from 
Universal Studios, where they acted as tour guides; and from Las Vegas on St. 
Patrick's Day, where they tried the "luck o' the Irish" for several KROQ 
audience members. 
</P>
<P>
The deejays also use the telephone to raise havoc. Over the last few months, 
this included a call to a Las Vegas bookie the day after Pete Rose was 
convicted to "see if we could get odds on whether he would serve all five 
months or not," and Baxter's repeated calls to the United States Supreme Court 
in an attempt to get Ryder nominated to the seat vacated by Justice William 
Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder and Baxter met at KZZP-FM in Phoenix, where Baxter worked an afternoon 
show and Ryder worked a night show. The two kept in touch after Baxter became 
music director at San Francisco's KXXX-FM in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be fun to do a morning show," Baxter said, "never having 
done one." Baxter persuaded the station's program director to let the pair get 
together for a Sunday 3-7 a.m. shift, and the subsequent aircheck tape led them 
to KROQ program director Andy Schuon, who hired them shortly after.

PROPOSED COUNTY JAIL BOOKING FEE ALARMS POLICE OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: SUPERVISORS WILL HEAR A PLAN TO REDUCE THE SHORTFALL BY CHARGING CITIES 
AND OTHER BODIES $75.50 PER PRISONER. BOARD SPOKESMEN PUT THE BLAME ON STATE 
CUTS.

<P>
As county officials huddled Monday to patch together a budget in time for a 
scheduled vote next week, law enforcement leaders from across the county were 
expressing deep concern about one suggestion for trimming a shortfall of as 
much as $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which supervisors will take up during a public hearing Wednesday, 
would levy a $75.50 fee against police bodies -- including those from cities, 
school districts, colleges and universities -- for each prisoner brought to the 
county jail system for processing. If approved, the fee is expected to have its 
most drastic effect on cities. Officials from a dozen Orange County 
municipalities said Monday that the effect in their areas could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a rich city by any means, and that money would have to come from 
somewhere," said Garden Grove Police Chief John Robertson, who estimated that 
the fees could cost his city $380,000 a year. "If it came from the Police 
Department, that would be approximately eight police officer positions." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, where 20,000 to 22,000 prisoners are booked into jail each year, 
the proposed fee could cost the city $1.6 million a year, Santa Ana Police Lt. 
Robert Helton estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Even in smaller cities with fewer arrests, the expense would be burdensome, 
officials said. Brea officials, for instance, said the fees would cost them 
between $10,000 and $15,000 a year, while Buena Park Police Chief Richard M. 
Tefank estimated that the plan would cost that city $140,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very serious. I don't think it would bankrupt us, but it's just 
adding to the costs that are continually being passed on by the state and the 
county," said Los Alamitos Police Chief James Guess. "The cities like us with 
very limited revenue sources are being held hostage by this," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few cities, those with adequate jail facilities to handle their own 
prisoners, would be relatively unscathed. In Newport Beach, San Clemente and 
Anaheim, police officials believe they could absorb the fees without much 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are aware of the cities' opposition to the proposal, but are 
confronted with a bleak budget picture for this year. 
</P>
<P>
The state budget, especially after Gov. George Deukmejian reshaped it with his 
veto, slashed funding to counties and left Orange County facing an estimated 
$46 million in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
"We all just feel frustrated by the state handing down these cuts," said Ronald 
S. Rubino, who met with supervisorial aides Monday afternoon to outline the 
state of the county's budget. "It's unfair, but necessary, that we look at some 
ways to increase revenue." 
</P>
<P>
While the state trimmed funds for an array of county programs, it also passed 
along authority for the county to raise fees in new areas. The largest 
potential windfall was in the area of property tax collection, where Rubino 
said the county can expect to get an additional $14 million next year by 
charging other public entities for collecting their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Jail booking fees are less lucrative, but still are expected to give the county 
an additional $4.1 million to $5.9 million a year. Unlike the property tax 
collection fees, which will go into effect automatically unless the board 
specifically exempts them, the jail-booking fee must be approved by a majority 
vote of the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors are being asked to institute the $75.50 fee beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
The vote is set for Wednesday, but some city law enforcement agencies and 
others are asking the board to consider postponing action until the full 
implications of the fee can be examined. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the county's having some problems with its budget and that 
the state passed the buck without passing the buck," said Bill Hodge, executive 
director of the Orange County chapter of the California League of Cities. "But 
we do have some concerns of our own."

When handicapped children go to a park, they usually wait for a turn that never 
comes. Because playground equipment is not designed for the handicapped, they 
can't get on the swings, play basketball, or even take a ride on a 
merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, I sit in the sandbox and watch everybody else play," said 
Ketan Gandhi, 9, who is afflicted with osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that 
makes the bones brittle. 
</P>
<P>
His mother knows that her son wants to join the other children. 
</P>
<P>
"I see his eyes. They are hurt. But he knows he can get hurt if he plays," 
Mrudula Gandhi said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Santa Ana Kiwanis Club and city park officials hope to help 
children like Ketan by building the county's first playground for the 
handicapped, where basketball courts will have adjustable hoops and swings can 
accommodate wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Santa Ana City Council approved an agreement with the Kiwanis 
Club to begin developing the 6 1/2-acre, "barrier-free" facility within 
Thornton Park, located on Segerstrom Avenue. The approval also gives the club a 
chance to solicit donations and apply for grant funds to buy playground 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis Club proposed the park idea 3 years ago after working with students 
at Santa Ana's Carl Harvey School for physically handicapped children, said 
Clint Hopson, a club member. One member visited a park in Omaha, where city 
officials built a playground specially for the handicapped. He then persuaded 
the club to try to do the same in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that many of the kids didn't have a place to play and didn't have 
a place to be like any other child," Hopson said. "We made it one of our top 
goals to help the handicapped children have a place they can call their own." 
</P>
<P>
At first, city and club officials concentrated on expanding a therapeutics 
program at Fisher Park on the northern tip of the city. But that park wasn't 
large enough for the specially designed equipment and also did not have enough 
parking spaces, said Ron Ono, a park landscape-design manager for the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials then settled on Thornton Park, which is the city's 
least-developed recreational area. The "barrier-free" section is planned on a 
grassy knoll in the 30-acre park's north section. The facility will include two 
basketball courts with hoops that adjust, a playground, special trails to the 
park's lake, and a camping area with handicapped-accessible bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis Club is trying to raise money and get support from other 
organizations to help build the park, club president Angel Rivas said. The 
estimated cost is at least $300,000, a good portion of which will go into 
buying playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no park like this in the county," Rivas said. "Once this is built, 
handicapped kids from throughout the county can come here and play." 
</P>
<P>
Such a park is a dream come true for Ketan, who wants to ride a see-saw and 
play on a swing. For now, he makes do by "popping wheelies" on his wheelchair 
and playing on the limited number of gym items at his school. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have fun just like everybody else," he said.

CITY TO FINANCE PILOT RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A six-month pilot curbside recycling program that was to have cost 1,000 
residents about $15 each will instead be paid for by the city, the City Council 
has decided. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision to finance the program came after several residents 
questioned the proposed $2.48 monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I have to pay for something that I am already doing on my own," 
Christina Hayes asked. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point is one of three South County cities taking part in a trial curbside 
recycling program with Solag Disposal Co. of San Juan Capistrano, the company 
that handles refuse collecting in each community. The program was organized in 
response to the September passage of state Assembly Bill 939, which requires 
California cities and counties to show a 25% reduction in landfill garbage by 
1995 and a 50% reduction by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Households in San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente and the unincorporated 
community of Laguna Hills are also taking part in the trial program, expected 
to begin Oct. 2. Funds redeemed from the recyclable materials will be 
transferred back to the cities or counties. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in each of the communities will be provided with three bins, one each 
for newspaper, glass and cans. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the six-month period, the council will take another look at the 
program and vote again on its funding. 
</P>
<P>
Future phases of the recycling program are expected to reach 15,000 homes in 
San Clemente, 6,500 homes in San Juan Capistrano and 5,400 homes in Dana Point.

MAILER CRITICIZES GARBAGE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy over the city's garbage-removal contract grew hotter last week 
when a consultant for a waste-hauling firm sent a mailer urging residents to 
pressure the City Council to allow competitive bidding for the trash franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer, sent by Ellis/Hart Associates on behalf of Western Waste Industries 
of Irvine, criticizes a recent City Council decision not to allow competitive 
bids for the residential trash-collection contract. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer included a clip-out "trash tax protest card" addressed to the 
council that said, "I . . . believe that the free enterprise system demands 
that before you raise our taxes, you require competitive bidding. I will 
remember this trash tax increase on election day." 
</P>
<P>
David Ellis, chief executive officer of the political consulting firm, said his 
client is protesting a 3-2 council decision last month to award an exclusive 
contract to Waste Management Inc. of Irvine, which has held the franchise in 
Mission Viejo for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition in trash hauling will guarantee the best rates and service," he 
said. "Right now, there is no competition in Mission Viejo. All we're asking 
for is a chance to compete." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ellis said he had received more than 1,000 cards. Another mailer is 
scheduled to be mailed Thursday, asking residents to attend next Monday's 
council meeting, at which members will make a final decision on awarding the 
contract to Waste Management. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the council denounced the mailer, calling it a political move 
aimed at Councilman Norman P. Murray, the only council member running for 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Murray was one of three council members, along with Victoria C. Jaffe and 
William S. Craycraft, who voted last month in favor of Waste Management. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very sad that Mission Viejo has been chosen as the pawn for trash 
wars," Jaffe said. "This is a throwback to the '50s, when intimidation and 
threats were commonplace between trash companies." 
</P>
<P>
Murray called the mailer "a blatant attempt to pressure me prior to my vote. If 
there is a way for Western to sway me, this isn't the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Christian W. Keena, who favors competitive bidding for the franchise, 
said the mailer was a "regrettable move." 
</P>
<P>
But pointing to the Waste Management contract, which at $11.85 per household is 
the highest among Orange County cities, Keena said that many citizens "are 
absolutely shocked about the way we do business, about the fact that we would 
have higher rates." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Fred Sorsabal has defended the contract, saying that the new deal 
pays for several additional services not contained in the city's previous pact 
with Waste Management. FRANK MESSINA

PROGRAM OPENING DOORS TO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For some students at Anaheim High School, getting to college has been little 
more than a dream. But a program called University Preparation is helping 
college become a reality for about 70 students. 
</P>
<P>
The high school, part of the Anaheim Union High School District where 
achievement test scores are often among the lowest in the county, started the 
program 5 years ago to encourage Latino students who might not otherwise think 
about college as a goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our kids will be the first in their families to graduate from high 
school, let alone go to college," said Jeannie Beckett, a teacher who works 
with the program. "So the idea of even going to college was way out there." 
</P>
<P>
At Anaheim High, 80% of the students are Latinos, and many come from low-income 
families "so the students have a lot of other stresses and a lot of other 
responsibilities," said Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
For half of every school day, the students attend courses in math, English, 
sciences and social studies in smaller classes with special teachers who are 
familiar with the aptitude and progress of each student. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 students participate in the program every year. Last June, the first 
group that started as freshmen graduated. Sixty-three of the graduates went on 
to college, contrasted with less than a dozen in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Similar programs at eight other schools in California were started with state 
grant funding. But after three years, when state funding was cut, most of the 
other programs folded. The Anaheim program continues. 
</P>
<P>
Carmela Harvey, coordinator of school relations at Cal State Fullerton -- where 
the majority of the Anaheim graduates take classes -- said the Anaheim program 
and others like it are keys to helping students get into and stay in college. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking at educating a population that maybe was ignored. . . . At 
least they need to know that somewhere down the road college can be an option," 
said Harvey. "Programs like that, coupled with other programs, certainly 
enhance the students' preparation." 
</P>
<P>
The program is beginning to recruit from the junior high schools, and will 
begin again this fall. LISA MASCARO

RESCUE TEAM TRACKS DOWN MISSING HIKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY CHABOT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old Orange man admitted Monday that he bit off more than he could 
chew when he went hiking alone in an area near Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Cupkie spent an uneventful night in Holy Jim Canyon when he grew too 
tired to hike out before dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew exactly where I was," Cupkie said from his home Monday. "I just ran out 
of energy to get out. . . . I put a lot of people through a lot of trouble, but 
I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
Cupkie's mother had called the Orange County Sheriff's Department shortly 
before 10 p.m. Sunday to report that her son might be lost in the canyon. 
Deputies began a ground search soon after, and Cupkie was found unharmed about 
7:35 a.m., walking along a brush-covered trail. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said that settling in for the 
night was the best move Cupkie could have made. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of your experienced hikers will tell you that when darkness comes, the 
smartest thing to do is find a place, get comfortable and wait for daylight," 
Olson said. "A lot of people get injured after dark when they panic and try to 
get out. I suspect that's what happened to our last victim out there. It was 
dark and he fell over a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
Cupkie, who said he took up hiking a few years ago, left a map of his planned 
route with his mother before he left, making finding him much easier for 
sheriff's deputies, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to go right to where his vehicle was," Olson said. "If he hadn't 
left a map, it could have taken hours to locate him out there." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said that by 3:50 Monday morning, at least two bloodhounds and seven 
search and rescue team members were looking for Cupkie.

PEOPLE: MOVIE SET SCOUT STILL LOOKING FOR DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most kids, Laura (Lolly) Powell, dreamed of being in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
But now that she's close to the movie-making action, Powell has a different set 
of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a choice, I'd like to be a co-host with (TV talk show host) David 
Letterman," mused the Fullerton woman who gets paid to find filming sites and 
buildings in Orange County for movie-makers. 
</P>
<P>
She works in the Orange County Film Liaison Office and despite her close 
connection with movie people, Powell finds the movie-making process somewhat 
uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of standing around," said the Pepperdine University graduate who 
majored in sports medicine. "I just want to see the finished product." 
</P>
<P>
Standing around and being idle is not one of Powell's traits. 
</P>
<P>
She kept an active life after college including European travel, working as a 
law firm researcher, writing manuals for an automobile advertising association 
and formulating direct mail campaigns for an advertising agency. She also 
worked as a personal trainer in health clubs but said she was more interested 
in putting out the club's newsletter than helping keep people fit. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Powell, 29, would rather be a writer. Part of her job in 
the film office is writing and taking pictures for the county's monthly 
employee newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"I like writing and would rather be on the other side of this interview," she 
said. "That may be my future. Seeing something you have written in print or a 
picture you have taken validates what you do." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, she's making a name for herself with the movie folks. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they find themselves comfortable working with me," said Powell who 
often finds herself trying to fill seemingly impossible requests. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she's trying to find a building with lots of glass in front and back 
that can be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to film a truck driving through the front door and out the back," 
she said. "It's sometimes hard to convince the building's owner that it can be 
returned to its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who said she is rarely surprised with some of the film requests, which 
include blowing up a building, appears to be filling the bill. 
</P>
<P>
As of June, the county has issued 16 film permits, just one less than all of 
last year and Powell feels that the number will double this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be my hope it would triple," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell likes to get out on film location. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make contact with the people that I deal with," she said, while 
walking through a film setting in front of the Santa Ana Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Since accepting the film liaison job a year ago, Powell had a more than passing 
interest in her travels through the county. 
</P>
<P>
At times she has to be aware of location problems such as having a palm tree 
near a spot where the producer wants a Midwestern look. "I'm always looking for 
a site location some film company might use," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact she is putting together a location guide of Orange County sites and has 
developed a network with the various cities in the county for filming 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said part of her efforts is not only to keep filmmaking in California, 
but to make Orange County one of its prime locations. 
</P>

Australia. The games are held every 2 years.

REPORT URGES GOVERNMENTAL DAY-CARE ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC POLICY: MOST PARTICIPANTS IN AN ORANGE COUNTY ISSUES FORUM SAID CHILD 
CARE IS NOT SOLELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FAMILIES. 
</P>

<P>
Children's day care should become a governmental responsibility, especially for 
low-income mothers, according to an informal survey released Monday by the 
National Issues Forum of Orange County, a private, nonprofit organization that 
encourages discussion on public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"About two-thirds of the participants in Orange County said preschool programs 
should be a public responsibility in much the same way as roads and public 
schools," said Harriett Walther, a forum spokeswoman and also a Saddleback 
Community College District trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which was presented to an audience of public officials and policy 
makers in Newport Beach, included the results of questionnaires answered by 
hundreds of county residents who attended 36 forum-sponsored meetings on the 
environment, drug abuse and child care, Walthers said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who attended the presentation, 
said the report "was interesting." However, Cox noted that forum members said 
their survey was unscientific. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were pretty clear that the report is not public opinion or a 
scientific survey but responses from forums designed to encourage people to 
think more deeply on the issues," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to child care, Walther said that 86% of the forum participants said 
they would support a tax increase of $50 per year to help pay for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
"That is particularly interesting in light of how we've voted in this county 
against such transportation issues as Measure M," said attorney Stan Wolcott, a 
forum director. 
</P>
<P>
Walther said the idea behind the forum is to elicit discussions on world issues 
and then present findings to policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to know that people out there in the community are thinking about 
these issues," Walther said. "Elected officials tend to hear only public 
opinion polls or from special interest groups." 
</P>
<P>
Forum participants also said that employers must share responsibility for child 
care with government. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what solution is adopted," the report said, "two-thirds of Orange 
County respondents agreed that child care is not the sole responsibility of the 
family, but rather an issue that needs cooperative solutions involving 
employers and government."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
QUESTIONS ABOUT AN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shifting struggle for civil rights in America in part is being won and lost 
these days in suburban neighborhoods. Local law enforcement agencies can play 
an important part in the outcome simply by the manner in which they investigate 
acts of violence with racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activists are expressing concern that the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department's current investigation of a brutal attack on a black girl in 
Anaheim two weeks ago may not be as vigorous or sensitive as it should be. The 
department insisted last week that it was investigating the case only as an 
assault and not as a racial incident, a disturbing approach in view of what the 
victim and witnesses have reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Amber Jefferson, is recovering at home after having her face ripped 
open with a shard of glass in a dispute between blacks and whites in a 
condominium parking lot. Black leaders understandably are concerned that this 
case merely reinforces images of the suburbs as off-limits to minorities, and 
that the beating of a black girl may go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that investigators must take care before filing charges. However, 
they should not disregard a racial dimension to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the Sheriff's Department might be well-advised to call in the 
U.S. Justice Department to examine the civil rights aspects of this troubling 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
After all, local law enforcement agencies should be sensitive enough to racial 
issues to know when they can benefit from outside expertise in the course of an 
investigation. In the future, they are likely to have more, not fewer, such 
inquiries, especially as different ethnic groups move into previously all-white 
enclaves. So agencies must have adequate guidelines and procedures of their own 
in place for conducting investigations of crimes with racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
How the Orange County Sheriff's Department handles this particular case will be 
a measure of the overall credibility of its inquiry, and the department.

Players from the Federal Little League in Cypress were the last to arrive here 
Sunday evening for the 44th Little League World Series, but they were enjoying 
the early part of their weeklong stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids, 'Take a look around, you'll never see it again. Ever,' " 
Cypress Manager Gary Shelton said. "I'm thrilled. You turn around and see 
35,000 people out there on a Saturday and if you aren't tickled like I am, 
you're not human. This is my dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron (Cypress assistant coach Ron MacDonald) and I got off the buses Sunday and 
just went wild. The kids, they ran down here (Lamade Stadium, where all Series 
games are played). Before we could stop them, they were already walking around 
the field. This is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Players from all eight Series teams were given physicals early Monday, then 
participated in workouts during a light afternoon rain. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress is scheduled to begin Series play in today's second game (2 p.m. PDT) 
against Brooklyn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who his starting pitcher would be, Shelton didn't hesitate. "Kerrie 
(Cordero), I don't have to think. He's my horse," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn is the Central Region champion. It enters the tournament with a 19-2 
record. 
</P>
<P>
In today's first game, Matamoros, Mexico, winner of the Latin America Region 
with a 15-1 record, meets Canadian champion Trail, B.C. (13-0). 
</P>
<P>
Cypress relied on its pitching and defense while compiling an 18-1 record and 
winning the Western Regional. Shelton said he feels those things will be the 
keys here. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Cordero, Shelton's pitchers are Bob Brito and Damon Katz. 
Cypress is led in hitting by Cordero, Eddie Zamora, Pat Murphy and Jake Koziel. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some nits and gnats that come up and get out there (on the bases) 
and these guys generally get them in," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
The manager's advice to his players entering Game 1? "We've got to take this 
one," he said. "One at a time, that's all we can do. It's a Little League 
field. There are nine guys on the field. There aren't going to be 10,000."

DEFENSE INDUSTRY MAY BE BIG WINNER IN PERSIAN GULF CRISIS

Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of New York-based Loral Corp., said the defense 
industry could benefit in the near term from the heightened military tensions 
resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Loral supplies a wide range of electronic warfare gear that is now being 
deployed in air and ground systems in Saudi Arabia, including tactical 
reconnaissance systems aboard aircraft and sensors in a variety of missiles, 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
And Ford Aerospace Corp. in Newport Beach, which Loral is in the process of 
acquiring for $715 million and other obligations, could also come out ahead if 
the Saudis purchase more McDonnell Douglas F-15E fighter jets from the U.S. 
government, as reported over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace makes the guidance systems for AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air 
missiles that are used on the F-15E. So far, Don Flamm, spokesman for Ford 
Aerospace, said he is not aware of any impending sale of Sidewinder missiles to 
the Saudi government. 
</P>
<P>
But he said any Sidewinder sale would be a boon to the company's aeronutronic 
division, which employs 2,700 people in Newport Beach. The division has made 
130,000 guidance systems since the program was started in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
The guidance system has accounted for $1 billion in Ford Aerospace sales since 
1969, Flamm said, and it continues to be one of the division's major programs. 
Each system costs about $20,000, Flamm said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz has acknowledged that the Newport Beach division, which accounted for 
$316 million of Ford Aerospace's $1.85 billion in sales last year, is 
unprofitable. But he believes the aeronutronic arm is poised for a turnaround, 
and another sale of Sidewinders to the Saudis wouldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
For the long term, however, Schwartz said he believes the Iraqi crisis will 
have little impact on military spending levels. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope there will be a renewed focus on the idea that the United States 
has global interests that need protecting and that funding will be determined 
by the requirements for protection," he said.

DEL TACO CHIEF IS CHAMPION OF FAST-FOOD FIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: THE COSTA MESA COMPANY'S NEW PRESIDENT HOPES TO DUPLICATE HIS 
TURNAROUND TRIUMPH WITH BURGER KING. 
</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Moriarty, new president and chief executive of Del Taco Inc., is having 
his photo taken outside one of the company's Costa Mesa restaurants when he 
notices a dirt smudge on the orange sun logo on the wall behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you get me a cloth, please?" he asks the store manager. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing atop a bicycle stand, he begins shining the logo. "There's the 
photo," he says, laughing and turning his head to see if the photographer has 
taken the hint. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty, who joined Del Taco three weeks ago, is nothing if not market-savvy. 
In 1986, he took a chain of 288 Burger King restaurants in Chicago whose sales 
had plummeted 15% and, within two years, made it the most profitable chain in 
the company. Using what he likes to call guerrilla marketing tactics, Moriarty 
out-promoted the competition with a budget of $3 million -- about a sixth of 
the money he claims McDonald's spent during the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew their doors off," Moriarty boasted. "As a result, (Burger King) gave 
me half the United States." He was promoted in 1988 to vice president in charge 
of the company's 30-state Central and Western divisions, overseeing 2,500 
outlets. He left Burger King in April, a year after it was acquired by Grand 
Metropolitan of London. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty faces no less a challenge now in Southern California. Del Taco's major 
competitor, Taco Bell Corp. of Irvine, has seized a 70% share of the Southern 
California Mexican fast-food market, according to Taco Bell figures. 
Nationally, Taco Bell has 3,300 restaurants, or about 10 times more than Costa 
Mesa-based Del Taco. (The rights to franchise Del Taco restaurants outside 
California are owned by an Atlanta-based firm.) And Taco Bell, with sales of 
$2.1 billion last year, has access to the resources of parent company PepsiCo 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Del Taco, meanwhile, has been trying to play catch-up while contending with two 
ownership changes in the past two years -- the most recent a management buyout 
in January that left the company an estimated $150 million in debt. A 1988 
merger with the Naugles Mexican food chain and subsequent menu changes and 
price increases have confused customers or sent them scurrying to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
And Del Taco's own marketing efforts haven't always cleared up the confusion. 
For example, an attempt to unify the chains with a "Viva Naugles, Viva Del 
Taco" TV advertising campaign was quickly canceled when viewers complained that 
they couldn't understand why two competing chains would be featured in the same 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Another setback came last month when Del Taco/Naugles President Wayne 
Armstrong, the executive who led the management buyout, resigned for personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be worried if it were not for my very high regard for Kevin," said 
Steve Read, senior vice president of G.E. Capital, the General Electric Corp. 
unit in San Francisco that financed the buyout. "Losing Wayne certainly had the 
potential to be pretty disruptive. Having Kevin in the job absolutely minimizes 
that disruption." 
</P>
<P>
Read said he is impressed by Moriarty's enthusiasm and directness. "The guy 
captivated me," he said. "He is just what he seems to be." 
</P>
<P>
He said Moriarty will decide the direction of Del Taco. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty said he is still planning his moves, but he agreed that a turn the 
company took in January was in the right direction. Under the previous owner, 
Newport Beach restaurateur Anwar Soliman, Del Taco and Naugles had been adding 
fancier menu items and raising prices. Some old favorites like the Del Beef 
Burrito were removed from the menu. 
</P>
<P>
But in January, the new management team began bringing back the old favorites 
and lowering prices. The restaurants have introduced a 49-cent hamburger and a 
69-cent cheeseburger. Del Taco officials said the tactic has boosted sales by 
more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Mooslin, who was president of Naugles before Soliman merged the 
chain with Del Taco in February, 1988, said the strategy won't work. "Pepsi has 
an endless amount of money to throw into this thing, and Taco Bell won't allow 
itself to lose that battle," he said. "Southern California is too good a 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell spokesman Elliot Bloom said his company isn't worried by Del Taco's 
challenge. "We are the eighth-largest fast feeder in the world," he said. Del 
Taco, with sales of $211 million last year, ranks 87th, according to Nation's 
Restaurant News. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining Del Taco on Aug. 1, Moriarty has been visiting the chain's 
restaurants and learning the kitchen operations well enough to serve up Big Del 
Beefs or taco salads to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty, in fact, is an old hand on the service side of the restaurant 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
On his 18th birthday, Moriarty's mother hustled him out of bed to start his 
first day at the family-owned pub, Moriarty's Cafe, in the Flatbush section of 
Brooklyn, N.Y. Moriarty's mother had kept the pub running for several years 
after her husband's death until Moriarty and his brother were old enough to 
take over. The two brothers ran the pub for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty gave up full-time management of the family pub in 1974 and joined a 
Burger King management training program to learn more about food service. He 
planned a 6-month stint at Burger King, but he ended up staying 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
When he left Burger King in April, he was vice president of operations and also 
one of five members of the company's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
He had planned to take the summer off, spend some time with his family and get 
his pilot's license. He got the license, but his plans for a laid-back summer 
went out the window when Del Taco offered him a job. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty said he lost his enthusiasm for Burger King when it was acquired by 
Grand Metropolitan as part of the company's 1989 takeover of Pillsbury Corp., 
which owns Burger King. Grand Metropolitan centralized Burger King's corporate 
structure, reducing Moriarty's autonomy. "There was less room for him to be 
entrepreneurial," said Michael Hagerthy of Interim Management Corp. in 
Torrance, who recruited Moriarty for the Del Taco job. "Even though he was one 
of the top guys, it just wasn't the same place to him." 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty said he not only likes running his own show but believes that such 
independence will ultimately work in Del Taco's favor. He draws a comparison 
between restaurant chains such as Del Taco and McDonald's, which are only in 
the fast-food business, and others like Taco Bell and Burger King that are part 
of larger companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Burger King is a subsidiary, so they make determinations on their investment 
based on their entire portfolio," he said. "McDonald's, on the other hand, is 
just McDonald's. They're thinking about McDonald's next month, and they're 
thinking about McDonald's 10 to 15 years out. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, (McDonald's) spends $50 million building a facility to support 
their restaurant. I don't care what volume they do in that restaurant, they 
won't make any money there. But they're building for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty plans to run Del Taco his way. He plans to temporarily close the 
corporate offices later this year and dispatch top executives to the kitchens 
of Del Taco and Naugles restaurants for a day or two -- something he also had 
done at Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Terrano, who is now a market controller for Burger King in New York, was 
one of those executives Moriarty hauled from an office into a kitchen when they 
were in Chicago together. Terrano said he learned a bit about pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"You look up and see 100 people in line, well, it's not like sitting in an 
office," he said.

AMERICAN SPEEDY CHAIN TO OPEN IN INDIA; 
</P>
<P>
JOINT VENTURE: KAISER INTERNATIONAL OF ANAHEIM AND AN INDIAN FIRM WILL LAUNCH 
150 QUICK-COPY SHOPS. EARLIER DEALS INVOLVED JAPAN AND EUROPE.

<P>
Kaiser International Inc., the master franchiser of American Speedy Printing 
Centers in California, said Monday that it has tentatively agreed to enter into 
a joint venture that will open a chain of about 150 quick-print copy shops in 
India. 
</P>
<P>
William Culp, Kaiser's president, said the company has signed a letter of 
intent with Technova Ltd., an Indian company, to form the joint venture. The 
Bombay-based venture represents Kaiser's latest expansion abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal is as good as done," Culp said. "The 150 printing shops will be run 
by the joint venture company, and we intend to have about four pilot stores in 
place by March next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Indian partner, Technova Ltd., will own 74% of the new company, while 
Kaiser will have 26%. Technova is a holding company whose operations include 
the manufacture and distribution of films and chemicals used by the local 
printing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Technova, which operates Print Well, a commercial printing subsidiary in India, 
has annual sales of about $260 million. Technova President Minoo Saher said the 
company will supply the management and personnel to the joint venture and 
Kaiser the technology and the franchise license. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture plans to locate the Speedy printing service stores in major 
manufacturing areas throughout India, Culp said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now deciding on the locations of the pilot in Bombay, on the production 
line and the type of machinery that will be installed in the pilot stores," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Culp said Kaiser, which has annual sales of $20 million, is also facilitating a 
licensing agreement between a Japanese printing press manufacturer and an 
Indian equipment manufacturing firm. The agreement will allow the Indian 
company to make the printing machines and equipment for use by Speedy 
franchises in India, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest hurdles that we would face going to India was lack of 
high-quality printing equipment," Culp said. "We had to find a local source, 
and facilitating a licensing agreement between a Japanese company and a local 
Indian company will solve that problem." 
</P>
<P>
P.J. Raval, Kaiser's director of Indian operations, will oversee Kaiser's new 
venture and represent the company in India. He will be based in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
American Speedy will be competing against a growing industry in India. The 
latest Ministry of Industry survey on India's printing industry shows that the 
number of general commercial presses in 1986 was 71,150. The ministry projects 
a growth of 6% annually for the industry, with about 94,000 commercial presses 
in operation by next year. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, Kaiser signed a similar joint venture pact with two major 
Japanese concerns -- Canon Sales Inc. and Maruzen Co. Ltd. Last month, it 
bought the marketing rights from Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based American Speedy 
Printing Centers Inc. to sell American Speedy franchises in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser holds the master franchiser rights for American Speedy in Asia, Europe, 
California, Hawaii and Nevada.

AFTER YEARS OF GROWING PAINS, BIOTECHNOLOGY STOCKS ARE COMING OF AGE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: SOME STOCKS HAVE MADE SPECTACULAR GAINS IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS. 
ANALYSTS WARN THAT THERE ARE STILL RISKS INVOLVED.

Biotechnology stocks are shining after years of volatility and some big 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Although plenty of roadblocks still lie ahead, there are more products nearing 
the market and more investor money is pouring in, prompting analysts to say the 
once-fledgling industry has at last come of age. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 6 months, some biotechnology stocks have more than doubled in 
value, and the biggest companies have jumped nearly 50% in value. 
</P>
<P>
"The group is doing well because most of the technological risk is out of these 
stocks as they make the transition to commercialization," said analyst Stuart 
Weisbrod of Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. "Most companies will soon 
introduce drug products, making the valuation on these stocks a lot more sane." 
</P>
<P>
Some biotechnology companies are pursuing genetic engineering to produce large 
quantities of rare proteins that are essential to the immune system or that 
play other important roles in fighting disease. The approval or impending 
approval of such drugs has sparked plenty of fireworks on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Seattle-based Immunex Corp., for example, has jumped to $30 a 
share from $12 last December. A federal Food and Drug Administration advisory 
committee will soon review an Immunex protein said to jump-start the immune 
system after bone marrow transplants. A favorable review could mean swift 
marketing approval from the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Chiron Corp.'s stock has jumped to $40.125 from $30.50 last December. That 
company received approval this year for its hepatitis C test kits. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, now the second-largest biotechnology firm in the 
nation behind Genentech Inc., has soared to $81 from $59.50 a share last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say more investor money will pour into the industry once Roche 
Holdings Ltd. of Switzerland pays $1.6 billion to buy 60% of Genentech. The 
deal between Roche and Genentech, which is based in South San Francisco, was 
reached earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Most investors owned Genentech because they wanted to invest in biotechnology. 
That $1.6 billion will be freed up by the end of July. I think a fair amount 
will come back in to the biotech stocks," said Jim McCamant, editor of the 
Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the bounce in the stocks are broader-based 
investor groups, said John Catterall, vice president at Biogen Inc., a 
biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Catterall said that large pension funds, which have long avoided biotechnology, 
are now investing in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying fabric here is that historically biotech stocks have been owned 
by specialty funds and sophisticated niche players. What you see now is what I 
call mainstreaming -- the traditional pension funds are getting a little 
toehold in the group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has also received a boost from a number of headline-making 
products. 
</P>
<P>
One of these is a hormone that a preliminary study reports may be able to 
reverse the effects of aging. Others include a drug that increases the 
production of red blood cells, and one that dissolves blood clots and could be 
used to treat heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
Among at least six new drugs await Food and Drug Administration approval are 
proteins to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and to combat septic shock, 
a life-threatening infection afflicting many surgery patients. 
</P>
<P>
But investing in biotechnology is tricky. These stocks are volatile because 
investors are trying to assess the potential of products still being developed. 
Some drugs may not be as successful as analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the stocks will cycle," said Jeffrey Casdin, an analyst at Oppenheimer 
&amp; Co. "They are in a long-term upturn that is not immune to market 
correction. But in the long term, the cycles will become less volatile as there 
are more products to underlie the earnings of these companies."

Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and several other banks, following the lead of 
Citicorp, plan to introduce telephone banking services over the next year to 
give a jolt to their home-banking programs. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks a definite shift away from personal computers for home banking, 
a service that many banks have dropped because of low profit margins. It also 
indicates that banks believe they must keep up with Citicorp, which announced 
in March that it had developed a modified telephone for consumers to bank from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Manufacturers Hanover has asked several equipment suppliers to 
submit proposals for a telephone device that would allow customers to pay 
bills, transfer funds, and conduct other routine banking business from home. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Citicorp's initial offering, Manufacturers' proposed device could also 
deliver advanced telephone services such as voice messaging and caller 
identification and stock quotations. 
</P>
<P>
The Excel home banking program by Manufacturers Hanover is the fourth-largest 
in the country, with an estimated 7,200 customers in 1989. BankAmerica Corp., 
Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan Corp. hold the top three spots. 
</P>
<P>
In contacting suppliers, Manufacturers said, it is acting as the lead bank for 
an informal consortium of a dozen banks that want to offer a telephone device 
but cannot afford to develop their own. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the banks working with Manufacturers already offer home banking through 
the personal-computer-based videotex service known as Prodigy and use 
Manufacturers' software and back-office processing for home-banking 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy Services Inc., a joint venture of International Business Machines Corp. 
and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., delivers information services such as home 
banking, reservations and shopping via personal computers. The service is 
available in 42 cities and has 425,000 subscribers, though only a small portion 
of those use it for banking from home. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers does processing for CoreStates Financial Corp.'s Philadelphia 
National Bank, Comerica Bank-Detroit, First Interstate Bancorp's First 
Interstate Bank of Denver, Wells Fargo Bank, and several banks in the MAC 
automated teller network. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at these banks are reluctant to reveal their plans for a telephone 
home-banking device. "We don't want to tip off our competition," said a Wells 
Fargo executive. 
</P>
<P>
Sources expect Manufacturers to offer the telephone device to banks as part of 
its home-banking processing service. The banks would then rent the phones to 
customers for a monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks that we've had discussions with feel that an enhanced telephone is 
the way to go," said James Bauer, vice president of electronic banking at 
Manufacturers. "The interest is being driven by two factors. Banks want to 
position themselves because they feel threatened by Citibank. They also feel 
that the market is not right for PCs." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer acknowledged that Manufacturers is talking to equipment suppliers and 
other banks, but he declined to say which companies might make the device. He 
also said it was too early to say when such a device would be available or how 
it would be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp announced its Enhanced Telephone in March. The bank leases the 
telephone for a one-time fee of $49.95 plus $9.95 a month. The product is made 
by Philips International, a Dutch company. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred ETs are being tested with customers of two Manhattan branches of 
Citicorp. The ET can be used for home banking, making calls, storing phone 
numbers and automatic dialing. 
</P>
<P>
"A dedicated stand-alone banking device won't fly," Bauer said. The device, he 
said, must marry features of a computer terminal to a telephone and be able to 
take advantage of advanced services, called class services, by the phone 
company. Class services include voice messaging, accessing electronic 
directories and caller identification, a feature that delivers the telephone 
number of the calling party when the phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies have or are developing such devices. American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. recently announced a new telephone that incorporates a small 
touch screen. Called SmartPhone, the device can be programmed to make and 
receive phone calls with the push of a button. AT&amp;T hopes to distribute the 
phone through regional telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Banking services is one of the primary applications of the phone," said 
Michael Grisham, manager of strategic planning at AT&amp;T Network Systems.

ON BOTH SIDES OF SURROGATE PARENTING; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDBIRTH: A MOTHER WHO ONCE CARRIED A BABY FOR ANOTHER COUPLE NOW ASSISTS 
OTHERS IN FINDING SURROGATE MOTHERS. WHEN SHE BECAME UNABLE TO CONCEIVE, SHE 
EMBARKED ON AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER WHEN HER CHILD WOUND UP IN ANOTHER 
WOMB.

<P>
Kathy Wyckoff figured she knew all there was to know about surrogate parenting. 
She was a surrogate mother herself nine years ago, an experience that led her 
to found a surrogate brokerage business here. Since then, she has matched 
infertile couples with surrogates, completing more than 50 successful births. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Wyckoff and her husband, Tom Olivor, wanted their own child. By now 
unable to conceive, they decided to hire an experienced surrogate they knew 
from her company. Suddenly, Wyckoff found herself on the other side, as anxious 
as all her would-be parents at not being able to control the pregnancy of their 
unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea," she said. "Being the couple is so much more difficult than 
being the surrogate." 
</P>
<P>
Olivor, too, said he was on an emotional roller coaster until their surrogate, 
an unmarried Long Beach woman, delivered a healthy baby and they brought him 
home last week. "We took turns going crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, an estimated 4,000 babies have been born in surrogate arrangements 
in the United States, about half of them through a handful of professionally 
supervised programs, like Wyckoff's, the Center for Reproductive Alternatives. 
Most come off without a hitch: Less than 1% of surrogates change their mind and 
want to keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
Though rare, each contested case represents a contracting couple's worst 
nightmare come true. In the well-publicized Baby M case, New Jersey surrogate 
Mary Beth Whitehead changed her mind and was eventually awarded visitation 
rights; three years ago, a Chula Vista couple agreed to share custody with 
their Mexican surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
And most recently, Anna Johnson, an Orange County surrogate, sued the couple 
who hired her because they allegedly did not give her sufficient support during 
her pregnancy. However, it is the first contested case in which the surrogate, 
impregnated through in vitro fertilization, has no genetic link to the unborn 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases also spur consideration of public policy for what is becoming an 
increasingly popular alternative means of procreation. 
</P>
<P>
Many states have considered legislation on surrogation, and 16 have passed 
statutes, some providing misdemeanor penalties for engaging in a contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those which have 
banned surrogation or declared contracts unenforceable are: Arizona, Florida, 
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, brokers report an increase in what is known as gestational 
surrogation, as in the Johnson case. And they report many calls from 
"do-it-yourselfers" -- couples, like the pair who hired Anna Johnson, who have 
found their own surrogate and are seeking further directions on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
To Wyckoff, who runs a relatively small operation -- 10 cases a year -- out of 
her home, such cases also serve to illuminate the pitfalls of unregulated 
surrogate arrangements made by individuals without the benefit of programs like 
hers, which screen participants for compatibility and supply long-term 
psychological support. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff first became involved in surrogation 10 years ago as a married mother 
of three in the Midwest. She knew a couple who were desperately trying to have 
children but could not. Sympathetic, she tried to help them by researching 
alternatives. Catholics, like herself, they rejected surrogation as immoral. 
But Wyckoff said: "The more I found out, the more I knew this was the right 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than giving "the gift of life," she said she wanted to give the "gift of 
parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
She contacted a doctor in the Midwest who ran the only known program at the 
time. It required anonymity, provided no counseling and offered no choice to 
couples or surrogates, she said. Even her labor was induced. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when an infertile couple she had met in the clinic asked her to help 
them meet a surrogate and make the arrangements, she agreed, and subsequent 
referrals marked the beginning of her business. 
</P>
<P>
She relocated to California, after a divorce in 1984 and remarriage to Olivor, 
an architect. 
</P>
<P>
After five years, they decided they wanted children of their own. But 
complications from endometriosis, and later an ectopic pregnancy, forced 
Wyckoff to undergo a hysterectomy after which she could not conceive. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, her business was so well established she had repeat customers and 
repeat surrogates. Many of them, like Susie, had become personal friends who 
formed the core social life for Wyckoff, 36, and Olivor, 47. 
</P>
<P>
They had particularly admired Susie, a 28-year-old Navy merchandiser, for her 
strength and independence. She had given birth to healthy children twice 
before, once to a son who was adopted, and once to a daughter for a couple in 
the program. They asked her if she would be artificially inseminated. She 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem unusual to us," Olivor said. "In 1980, it was a radical thing 
to do. In 1990, it's not that radical a procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Following the procedure she prescribes for her clients, they each obtained 
lawyers, signed contracts stipulating that Wyckoff would adopt the child later, 
and attended psychological counseling sessions before the insemination. 
</P>
<P>
Over the duration of the pregnancy and two months after delivery, they will pay 
her about $13,000, following state guidelines for adoptions. The total cost to 
couples in the program ranges from $27,000 to $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
During her pregnancy, Susie kept on working and used the extra money for trips 
and a new car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff and Olivor said they tried to hide their anxiety from her in the belief 
that she would produce a calm child if she remained calm herself. 
</P>
<P>
However, Olivor said switching from observer to participant was "emotionally 
wrenching." At one point, Olivor, also a fallen-away Catholic, said he was 
certain a handicapped child would be God's punishment for having been involved 
in surrogation. "That's how crazy it got." 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff was equally unnerved over the lack of control and often wondered if she 
shouldn't have gone through another program other than her own. For instance, 
there was the question of whether the other surrogates would be jealous that 
the "Mother Superior" had played favorites by choosing one of them, a fear that 
didn't materialize, Wyckoff said. Moreover, there was the nagging feeling that 
she had just been consistently "lucky" in arranging 57 successful births. What 
if this would be the one time something went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff coached Susie during the brief delivery and cut the umbilical cord. She 
and Tom stayed at the hospital overnight and drove her home the next day. They 
stayed a half hour and left with the child. Later they sent a bouquet of 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
For Susie, who does not want to raise children of her own, it was basically a 
job, albeit a special one. "I kept that kind of an attitude," she said. "I 
never got attached to the baby. Never thought, what if he was mine." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are made to be moms, and some of us are made to do this." 
</P>
<P>
She said she will probably be a surrogate for another couple in the program in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had some major hard luck. . . . I've been lucky enough to get pregnant 
the first time, have healthy 8-pound babies, lots of hair. Good babies." 
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, she's also doing it for Wyckoff, whom she considers almost like a 
sister. "I see how Kathy feels the more time she spends with a couple and 
there's no baby. I know I could step in and say, 'OK, I don't mind being 
pregnant,' and everybody would be happy. Then that look would leave her eye. 
All gets right with the world." 
</P>
<P>
But she thinks she will quit the program when she's 30. "I don't want to be 
having kids the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rocking the sleeping baby named Michael, Wyckoff said her sympathies 
unquestioningly lie with the Calverts, the biological parents of the child 
being carried by Anna Johnson. "I understood Mary Beth Whitehead and her desire 
to keep the baby. But it's hard for me to understand where Anna Johnson is 
coming from." 
</P>
<P>
In her program, surrogate candidates are screened for genetic history, mental 
illness and chemical dependency -- and personality characteristics compatible 
with Wyckoff's. Once accepted, they attend group sessions to help one another 
deal with thoughts of keeping the child and accept that the baby will belong to 
the contracting couple. "I'd never have a surrogate in a program without 
ongoing psychological counseling and the camaraderie of other surrogates. It's 
essential." 
</P>
<P>
Even though her own surrogate said she did not need counseling after the birth, 
Wyckoff said she insisted, as always, "so they can resolve even the slightest 
thing said or done, so it won't come back to haunt them." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband see a big problem with the "do-it-yourselfers." 
</P>
<P>
"Do-it-yourself surrogacy is like wanting to go to Hawaii. You buy a yacht, and 
ask the broker, 'Which way to Hawaii?' He points and says, 'That way,' " Olivor 
said. "It's that kind of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
"It's that dangerous," Wyckoff added. 
</P>
<P>
These days, surrogation is more socially acceptable than when she started out, 
Wyckoff said. Whereas it was difficult to find mental-health or health-care 
providers 10 years ago, she has no problems today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the industry, such as it is, has yet to organize. There are fewer than 
10 successful brokers in the United States. Many fail because they don't have 
the credentials, or are too intent on making money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When practitioners met two years ago in Denver to devise professional 
guidelines, the meeting fell apart because of disagreements, Wyckoff said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, some, like Wyckoff, wanted to limit surrogates to those with a 
history of non-complicated childbirths, a proposal others called 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
Even the successful programs aren't necessarily alike, she said. Some insist on 
anonymity, some use balloon payments at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff said she continues to design her own business on the Golden Rule. "I 
try to treat the surrogate, and now the couples, as I'd like to be treated."

SMOTHERS BROTHERS' SHTICK STILL WORKS -- IN SMALL DOSES; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR SIBLING RIVALRY WAS WELL-RECEIVED BY THE FAMILY-ORIENTED CROWD AT KNOTT'S 
BERRY FARM, BUT 55 MINUTES OF IT PROVED TOO MUCH.

<P>
Halfway through the Smothers Brothers' late show at Knott's Berry Farm Friday, 
Dick (in case you forgot, he's the one mom always loved best) tried to make a 
point with Tom (he's the one she didn't) about how comedy needs to keep 
evolving to stay fresh. 
</P>
<P>
As primly condescending to poor Tom as ever, Dick said vaudeville may have had 
them roaring years ago, but it might have them snoring today. These hip, 
know-it-all, contemporary audiences want something different, he said, not the 
same old kick in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
Dick should have taken his own advice. The Smothers spent most of their 
55-minute set offering up the well-traveled basics of an act that, according to 
Dick's reckoning, has been around 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
The family-oriented crowd loved it -- proving once again that nostalgia is as 
good an entertainment hook for middle America as any -- but it was a pretty 
tired business, big on practiced delivery and low on inspiration. As usual, the 
guitar-wielding Tom played the puckish but always confused schlep to the 
exasperated, sometimes downright nasty Dick, his big bass at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Come on! You guys are over 50; haven't you found a way to get along yet? Family 
therapists are good at this sibling rivalry stuff. 
</P>
<P>
OK, that's flip. The Smothers Brothers have made a long and successful career 
working off that one premise, following in the tradition of Abbott and Costello 
and even the great Laurel and Hardy, other duos that turned misunderstanding 
and the art of not getting along into a cartoonish primal condition. 
</P>
<P>
It worked well for the Smotherses on their many folk-and-comedy records and 
especially during the run of their popular (and, to their credit, political and 
controversial) television variety show during the late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
But those forums gave them to us in punchy, tightly controlled doses, from 
three-minute gag songs to three-minute TV skits. A 55-minute helping in a large 
venue like Knott's Good Time Theatre -- where, except for in the front rows, it 
was nearly impossible to take advantage of Tom's signature face-making -- can 
be too much. 
</P>
<P>
The routine lacks exploration or new angles. Tom still fights to find the right 
musical key while Dick waits impatiently. Dick still gives self-satisfied 
renditions of popular tunes (this time out, he served up a spirited, 
intentionally mawkish "You Light Up My Life") as Tom watches, appropriately 
cowed by Dick's talent. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the show was genuinely amusing when Tom, as he always does, got 
his one chance to turn the tables. Speaking in elaborate and apparently correct 
Spanish, Tom gave a speech while Dick gaped, obviously the butt of the joke. 
</P>
<P>
As "The Yo-Yo Man," Tom displayed a series of accomplished yo-yo tricks that 
held the audience's interest, especially the children's. You could almost 
ignore all the silly patter -- "We are now entering the state of 'Yo' " -- and 
just enjoy Tom, an overgrown kid if there ever was one, doing what every 
talented kid loves to do: show off.

ZIGGY MARLEY BECOMING HIS OWN MON; 
</P>
<P>
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY TO ESCAPE THE SHADOW OF THE ELDER BOB MARLEY, BUT ZIGGY AND 
HIS BAND CAN STILL DO JUSTICE TO THEIR LEGACY WITH THEIR CONTEMPORARY VITALITY.

<P>
There seems something dishonest to seeing Ziggy Marley perform, though the 
fault certainly isn't Marley's. Instead, as a listener, there is the uneasy 
sensation that one is trying to cheat death. 
</P>
<P>
Like John Lennon, the late Bob Marley was a visionary, unifying performer who 
could have accomplished much more had his life not been cut short. But it also 
couldn't be argued that the performers didn't do enough while they were alive. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a Beatles reunion, Lennon once unleashed his sarcasm, asking if we 
really needed them to get up on that cross again -- weren't we paying attention 
the first time? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not, for both Ziggy Marley and Julian Lennon have been stuck by 
listeners with the unenviable task of establishing their own art while cloaked 
in their fathers' ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
While the younger Lennon seems to have stumbled under that burden, Ziggy and 
the Melody Makers' (featuring other Marley offspring Steve and Cedella Marley 
and Sharon Pendergast) Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre show Sunday did justice to 
their legacy while delivering their own music with a contemporary vitality. 
</P>
<P>
While Ziggy's controlled stage presence couldn't be confused with the 
commanding live-wire immediacy of his dad, he nevertheless offered a solid, 
propulsive set drawn from 1988's "Conscious Party" and last year's "One Fine 
Day" albums. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the demanding rough edges of the elder Marley, and buoyed by the 
exuberant youth of the Melody Makers -- sisters Cedella and Sharon dance like 
wildcats on a hot plate -- they have reached a larger U.S. audience than their 
father ever did. 
</P>
<P>
On most of their 14 songs a modern, energetic dance pulse was joined with 
socially conscious lyrics. Those lyrics weren't always up to the weight of the 
subject matter, as on "Black My Story (Not History)" which bit toothlessly at 
the truncated European view of African history taught in schools. Even Marley's 
resurrection of a Haile Selassie speech -- a staple of his father's 
performances -- seemed stilted and flat. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the exception amid the Marleys' uptown reggae grooves. Backed by a 
tight seven-piece band, they upped the octane of the album versions of 
"Tumblin' Down," "Look Who's Dancing," the unconditional "All Love" and the 
1985 track "Reggae is Now." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest of the original material was "Tomorrow People," which, with its 
incantation of "If you don't know your past, don't know your future" took on a 
particular resonance as performed to the largely young audience. 
</P>
<P>
Marley delivered a charged version of the late Marley's "Get Up, Stand Up" 
(with brother Steve handling Peter Tosh's mid-song rap) as well as a 
goose-bump-inducing encore of the meditative "Redemption Song." 
</P>
<P>
Opener Eek-a-Mouse has a unique, novel style of toasting (the Jamaican 
precursor of rap), sounding like a cross between Porky Pig, a tobacco 
auctioneer and a "Battlestar Galactica" Cylon warrior. But that wore mighty 
thin over his hourlong set. 
</P>
<P>
While it did get the crowd moving, his syllabic splatter, dead-simple reggae 
riffs and stork-like stage moves undermined whatever import the lanky singer 
might have intended for such numbers as "Terrorists in the City." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn's Family Stand, however, could have easily filled more than the brief 
35 minutes they were allotted. With their dance hit "Ghetto Heaven" as the 
centerpiece of their five songs, the septet offered a strong set of Sly 
Stone-derived soul and funk, resplendent with heavy bass lines, wah-wah guitars 
and cat-meow vocals.

Investors around the world went on a selling binge today, hammering stocks 
sharply lower on global markets in a computer-driven sell-off sparked by rumors 
and worries over the oil-rich Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. oil prices did a turnabout and dropped sharply following a speech by 
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein that traders viewed as conciliatory and less 
provocative than other statements he has made since the Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices fell sharply on Wall Street in heavy trading today as investors 
continued to worry about the prospect of war in the Mideast.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 52.47 to 2,603.96, according to 
preliminary figures.

In the broader market, losing issues trampled gainers by a ratio of nearly 7-1.

IRAQ TO BUSH: LET'S TALK;

SAME OLD RHETORIC, U.S. REPLIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein urged President Bush today to seek a peaceful 
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis or face global disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House said today the United States had no interest in negotiating 
with Hussein while Iraq remains in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In an "open letter" read on Iraqi television, Hussein said Bush had not taken 
up initiatives and solutions offered by Baghdad to resolve the 19-day-old 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He said the White House showed a lack of intelligence in dismissing his 
initiatives out of hand, not even seeking a formal text first. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) should look for peaceful solutions," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bush was to attack, a grave disaster would take place, not only regarding 
the region but regarding the whole world," the Iraqi president said. 
</P>
<P>
The message was released as Iraq's foreign minister, Tarik Aziz, told a news 
conference in Amman, Jordan, that Baghdad was ready for talks with Washington 
and denied that foreigners being held by Iraq are hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's previous peace offers -- immediately rejected by Washington -- included 
a suggestion that the Persian Gulf crisis be linked to an Israeli withdrawal 
from occupied Arab land and a Syrian pull-out from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's latest message was described by presidential press secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater as "much of the same rhetoric that we've heard before. Same old 
litany from Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we see very little to talk about when all we get are negative 
responses," Fitzwater told reporters accompanying Bush to a political 
fund-raising golf tournament at Falmouth, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said there would be no announcement today on the pending call-up 
of U.S. military reserves. White House officials said earlier in the day the 
executive order for Bush to sign was making its way through the bureaucracy 
from the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments in the gulf crisis today: 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq has moved into Kuwait 36 Scud missiles capable of hitting targets deep 
inside Saudi Arabia with chemical warheads, the publisher of the authoritative 
Jane's Defense Weekly, Paul Beaver, told Reuters. "We know that he did move 
missiles to Kuwait," Brig. Gen. Turki Bin Nasser, a Saudi base commander, told 
Pentagon pool reporters at a press conference in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the missiles increased the threat of a chemical weapons attack, he 
said, "I think he (Hussein) has the ability and he has the means of delivering 
chemical weapons and we are well trained for it." 
</P>
<P>
* An Iraqi freighter unloaded in Yemen, apparently the first vessel to dodge a 
blockade of the Persian Gulf by the U.S. and British navies after the United 
Nations imposed sanctions to punish Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
* The nine-nation Western European Union decided to step up and coordinate 
military operations in the Persian Gulf and urged the U.N. Security Council to 
take added measures to enforce sanctions against Iraq. The union effectively 
gave the go-ahead to three nations -- Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy -- to 
commit naval forces to the tense region. 
</P>
<P>
* President Francois Mitterrand said France would send ground forces to the 
United Arab Emirates in response to the crisis.

A powerful typhoon combined with the summer holiday rush to create the longest 
traffic jam in Japan's history -- an 84-mile-long highway mess, the Japan 
Highway Corp. said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the longest traffic jam on record, and it was basically caused by bad 
luck," corporation spokesman Katsutoshi Furuya said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many drivers were on the road that day because the typhoon had kept them off 
it the day before," he said. "Everything just seems to have come together in 
the worst way." 
</P>
<P>
The record-setting traffic snarl occurred on a highway between Hyogo and Shiga 
prefectures in western Japan. 
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 vehicles were involved in the traffic jam, which occurred Aug. 12, 
he said. Japanese generally take holidays in the Aug. 10-19 period to mark 
"O-bon," or the Festival of the Dead. It is a time when families gather to pay 
respects to their ancestors.

An oil heiress who says insurance for her jewelry costs too much was robbed 
last week for the fourth time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves broke into her mansion in affluent Newport early Friday and stole more 
than $1-million worth of diamonds and pearls as Carolyn Skelly slept nearby, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear a thing," Skelly said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the stolen items was insured, Skelly said. She told the Providence 
Journal-Bulletin she stopped insuring jewelry years ago because it became too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing left. I'm going down to the five-and-dime store to get a little 
costume jewelry until I get this other stuff back," Skelly said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The total take in the previous thefts was as much as $7 million. In 1982, 
Skelly was robbed in New York at gunpoint of $1-million worth of jewels.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sirens howled today to commemorate the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion on the first 
anniversary that Czechoslovaks were able to mark without fear of police 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Mayor Jaroslav Koran honored seven Soviets who protested the 
invasion that ended the "Prague Spring" of liberalization and replaced it with 
more than two decades of hard-line communism. 
</P>
<P>
Making the Soviets honorary Prague citizens, Koran told them their 
demonstration in Moscow's Red Square on Aug. 25, 1968, "salvaged the conscience 
of their silent country." 
</P>
<P>
"They protested against the . . . shameful treason committed by the tyrants of 
the day on a small friendly country," Koran declared. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, acting on a City Council declaration last week, also formally 
stripped Soviet dictator Josef Stalin of honorary citizenship, along with 
Czechoslovakia's first Communist president and Gustav Husak, the Communist 
Party leader installed by Moscow in the wake of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremonies was Yelena Bonner, the widow of Soviet dissident 
Andrei D. Sakharov, who criticized the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Bestowing the keys of the city to Bonner, Koran declared: "She's always had the 
key to our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries gathered for the ceremony at City Hall were Soviet 
Ambassador Boris Pankin and Alexander Dubcek, the reformist Communist Party 
leader who engineered the 1968 reforms only to see them crushed by the invading 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek, 69, who came back from years of official disgrace to become speaker of 
the nation's first free Parliament since 1948, chatted affably with Pankin. 
Their rapport was a striking example of the new reality in Eastern Europe, 
where democracies have replaced monolithic Communist rule in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today a T-55 tank appeared in Wenceslas Square, where weeping 
Czechoslovaks pelted Soviet armor with rocks and garbage 22 years ago. This 
time, spectators cheered. The Soviet-made tank was tipped onto its side by a 
crane and will be left standing through Sept. 6.

JULY'S BUDGET DEFICIT HITS $25.93 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States posted a $25.93-billion budget deficit in July following a 
shortfall of $18.24 billion in July, 1989, the Treasury Department announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Private economists had predicted a shortfall of $27 billion for last month, 
following federal budget deficits of $11.23 billion in June and $42.56 billion 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Outlays have been a lot higher this year," mainly because of the amount of 
cash being pumped into the ailing savings and loan industry, said Michael 
Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Niemira also said that government revenues were off from last year because of 
the slower pace of growth of the domestic economy, which he describes as being 
in a "growth recession." 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year to date, the United States is running a budget shortfall of 
$189.08 billion, and it is expected to finish the 12-month period on Sept. 30 
with a deficit of $220.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly budget statement, the Treasury Department said the previous 
fiscal year to date deficit stood at $123.66 billion in 1989, and the 
government expects to chalk up a total shortfall of $176.33 billion in fiscal 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department also said that the government spent $3.18 billion on 
the bailout of the nation's failed savings and loans for a total of nearly 
$35.20 billion for the fiscal year to date. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1991, the United States expects to spend at least $57.1 billion on 
the crippled thrift industry, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Receipts totaled $72.36 billion in July while total outlays stood at $98.29 
billion last month. For the current fiscal year to date, receipts totaled 
$850.10 billion while outlays totaled $1.04 trillion, of which $228.62 billion 
-- or about 22% -- went toward interest on the public debt. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the United States spent: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $18.44 billion on interest on government securities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $22 billion on the military. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $19.65 billion on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $17.35 billion on health and human services. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1.27 billion on veterans services and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1.10 billion on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA.

A military tribunal hearing genocide charges against Nicu Ceausescu, son of

Ceausescu is said to be suffering from hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and

He pleaded innocent to charges he ordered security forces in Sibiu to open fire 
on demonstrators during the December revolution while he was Communist Party 
chief in the region. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 people died during the fighting. During his trial, Ceausescu said 
the alleged order was a throwaway remark made while he was drunk that he 
retracted when he sobered up.

Retailer I. Magnin, announcing the closing of its Oakbrook Center store in 
February, says it will end its 19-year stay in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
Brent McDaneld, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based chain, said the 134 
employees at Oakbrook were told last Friday about the closing. 
</P>
<P>
He said talks were also under way to move out of I. Magnin's locations at 
Northbrook Court and on North Michigan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
All three locations are in upscale shopping areas. I. Magnin's market share has 
declined during the last 10 years due to recent additions, such as 
Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus and efforts by Marshall Field to attract more 
upscale clientele. 
</P>
<P>
McDaneld said I. Magnin, a unit of R. H. Macy Co., will stick to the West 
Coast.

Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said today that Vietnam's moves toward a market 
economy had opened the door for possible U.S. investment if Washington and 
Hanoi can end lingering differences. 
</P>
<P>
Lugar, the highest-ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit Vietnam since the end of the 
Vietnam War in 1975, met with Vietnamese Premier Doi Muoi and Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Co Thach over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We will report back to Washington that considerable progress has been made in 
moving toward market economics in Vietnam, that there are opportunities clearly 
for American businesses and that the United States should carefully consider 
whether that business opportunity situation should progress," Lugar told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained a total trade, investment and aid embargo 
against Hanoi since it defeated South Vietnam in 1975. Vietnam, unable to 
obtain World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans, has been devastated 
economically by the embargo.

Residents of Alaska pay the most in state and local taxes on a per-capita 
basis, and Mississippians the least, a survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Clearing House reported in its State Tax Review that per-capita tax 
burdens rose in the District of Columbia and 47 states in fiscal 1988 -- the 
last year for which data were available -- and declined in only three states: 
Oregon, West Virginia and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
California collected the most tax money -- $55.2 billion -- followed by New 
York, $52.5 billion; Texas, $25.2 billion; Illinois, $20.7 billion; 
Pennsylvania, $19.5 billion, and Florida, $18.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Alaskans were burdened with the highest per-capita tax bill -- $3,605 -- with 
property taxes accounting for $1,263 of that figure. 
</P>
<P>
District of Columbia taxpayers had the second-highest tax burden, $3,339, 
followed by New York, $2,934, and Connecticut, $2,281. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee all 
had tax burdens of less than $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
The median burden for all states was $1,627, up $97 from 1987, while the 
average was $1,772, up $107. The Commerce Clearing House determined the average 
burden in each state by dividing total tax collections by the population. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi reported the lowest per-capita tax burden, $1,088. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita increases in 1988 ranged from $443 in Alaska to $22 in California. 
The tax burden fell $10 in Oregon, $5 in West Virginia and $247 in Wyoming.

DEEP-DISH PIZZA INVENTOR DIES

Ike Sewell, the restaurateur credited with inventing "Chicago-style," deep-dish 
pizza, has died at 87. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell died Monday of leukemia at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
His first love was the Mexican food he grew up on in Wills Point, Tex. But his 
partner in an early restaurant venture didn't like it, so they hit upon the 
idea of pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell decided he wanted something more filling than regular pizza. The pair 
began experimenting and hit upon the deep-dish style. 
</P>
<P>
They opened Pizzeria Uno in 1943, and their deep-dish pizza made in an 
oversized pie tin became one of Chicago's culinary trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the restaurant led Sewell to open Pizzeria Due down the 
street in 1955. Eight years later, he opened Su Casa, heralded as Chicago's 
first upscale Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell eventually agreed to allow others to franchise his pioneering pizza 
concept, and there are now more than 50 Original Chicago Pizzeria Uno 
restaurants across the nation.

Aleksander Kirichenko of the Soviet Union, mastering the steeply sloped track 
at Maebashi's velodrome, won the men's amateur one-kilometer time trial today 
in the World Cycling Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Kirichenko's time of 1 minute, 03.565 seconds was nearly one second slower than 
his world record of 1:02.576 set in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is fast but I didn't have the strength to break my world mark," said 
Kirichenko, who became the first gold medalist at the newly built Green Dome. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,099-foot track has a maximum inclination of 42 degrees, one of the 
toughest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Vinnicombe of Australia finished second in 1:03.919. 
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to 1989 champion Jens Gluecklich of East Germany, who was 
clocked in 1:04.210. 
</P>
<P>
American Erin Hartwell finished 11th in 1:05.883. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's individual pursuit, American Mike McCarthy took the lead in the 
last few laps to beat East Germany's Jens Lehmann with the best qualifying 
time, 4:32.33.

The Chicago Bears and holdout defensive tackle Steve McMichael remained at an 
impasse after the latest contract talks failed to resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
No new negotiations were scheduled after McMichael and his agent met for more 
than two hours Monday with Bears finance director Ted Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
And with just two exhibition games to go before the regular season starts, the 
stalemate frustrated Coach Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems no sense of urgency, and that's always bothersome," Ditka said. 
"If there is a sense or urgency, you get it done. You don't vacillate and 
jockey for position. You meet head-on and say, 'Hey, let's talk about this 
thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
The team originally offered to raise McMichael's $500,000 contract to $775,000 
this year. But that offer was withdrawn after McMichael rejected it and missed 
the start of training camp July 26.

New York Mets outfielder Mark Carreon tore a ligament in his right knee Monday 
night and will be lost for the rest of the season, the preliminary medical 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Carreon slipped when rounding third base in the eighth inning of the Mets' 3-1 
loss to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He was carried off the field on a stretcher with a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
"Rounding and having to plant his foot, he just collapsed," New York Manager 
Bud Harrelson said. "It didn't look good, and obviously he was in a lot of 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
Carreon entered the game with a .308 average over the previous 11 games, going 
17 for 55. He went hitless in three at-bats before walking in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Carreon is batting .250 in 82 games with 10 home runs and 26 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Harrelson said the Mets will wait a day to decide on a replacement for Carreon.

Marlon Starling, who lost his World Boxing Council welterweight title to 
Maurice Blocker on Sunday, said the fight will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I quit," Starling said Monday from a Reno, Nev., hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I retire. It's over." 
</P>
<P>
Friends and advisers of Starling, a Hartford native, said they believe the 
two-time world champion is serious about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"He means it right now," said Melanie Byrd, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a distinct possibility," said Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik. 
"It's his decision alone." 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great career," said Starling's trainer, Freddie Roach. "If that's 
what he decides, great. None of us would be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Starling, who turns 32 next week, said his age and trouble with making weight 
finally caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to catch up with me someday," Starling said in an 
interview with the Hartford Courant. "I never felt like quitting before, but I 
felt like quitting this time." 
</P>
<P>
Blocker earned a majority decision, winning on two judges' cards. The third 
judge had the fight even. 
</P>
<P>
Starling said he is proud of his 11-year pro career. "I always tried my best," 
Starling said. "You can't win them all, but at least I tried. That's all you 
can do."

Azumah Nelson will defend his World Boxing Council super featherweight title 
against Juan LaPorte of Puerto Rico at the Sydney Entertainment Center on Oct. 
13, promoter Bill Mordey announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Mordey said the winner of the fight, which has been switched from Sept. 7 at 
Nelson's request, will fight Australian three-time world champion Jeff Fenech 
in Sydney in February. 
</P>
<P>
Mordey said he has signed a two-fight deal with American promoter Don King 
worth $1.6 million and said he will co-promote both bouts with King. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson relinquished the title earlier this year to challenge Pernell Whitaker 
of the United States for the WBC lightweight crown. He lost a decision to 
Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
LaPorte and Fenech were slated to meet for the vacant title, but the unbeaten 
Australian has twice withdrawn with a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
"The WBC has said it still recognizes Nelson as champion, so he will defend 
against LaPorte with the winner to face Fenech," Mordey said.

An autopsy today revealed that arterial disease caused the death of a 
36-year-old boxer who collapsed during a gym workout. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Maine chief medical examiner's office said the death of 
Rick Craney on Monday night was attributed to "severe stenosing coronary artery 
atherosclerosis." 
</P>
<P>
Craney was working out at a gym in preparation for his fight on the undercard 
of Saturday night's World Boxing Organization welterweight title fight when he 
was stricken. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Craney collapsed on an exercise bench after sparring three 
rounds each with two opponents at the Olympic Boxing Club. 
</P>
<P>
Craney, a one-time Maine welterweight champion, was to have fought Bernard 
Boisvert prior to a welterweight championship match between champion Manning 
Galloway and Nika Kumalo. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just finished sparring six rounds, and he was on an exercise bench when 
he slipped onto the floor," said trainer Gene Roberts, who was watching the 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
Another trainer helped Craney back onto the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'It's all right, I'm OK,' and then he fell again," Roberts said.

The producer of the hit London musical "Miss Saigon" said today that he would 
take a $600,000 loss rather than bring the show to Broadway amid controversy 
over his casting of a white man to play a Eurasian pimp. 
</P>
<P>
But Cameron Mackintosh left the door open for a rapprochement that could bring 
the show -- and its $25 million in advance ticket sales -- to Broadway in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
The show initially was supposed to begin previews a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the absence of a 
positive working environment and an understanding . . . that artistic freedom 
of choice cannot be compromised," Mackintosh said in a three-page statement 
released in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh, however, said that he was willing to work out differences with 
Actors' Equity and that he had sent the union a letter outlining the problems 
he felt must be overcome for a U.S. production. 
</P>
<P>
Equity's approval of Jonathan Pryce to play the role of the Eurasian was 
insufficient evidence that the union had a change of heart, Mackintosh said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their decision was made solely on the technical basis of Mr. Pryce's 
acknowledged star status. As I have repeatedly stated, it is also essential 
that the profoundly unpleasant atmosphere currently surrounding the production 
be dispelled," Mackintosh said. 
</P>
<P>
Equity Executive Secretary Alan Eisenberg was in a meeting this afternoon and 
unavailable to comment on the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh had canceled the $10-million production on Aug. 8 after Actors' 
Equity, which has veto power over a foreign actor's appearance in the United 
States, voted against letting Pryce bring his award-winning role to Broadway.

Poor health has led conductor Leonard Bernstein to cancel a six-city European

Bernstein hasn't fully recovered from respiratory ailments that plagued him 
last winter and spring, Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager, said Monday.

<P>
"Maestro Bernstein deeply regrets that he must follow his doctor's instructions 
and cancel his participation," Kraut said.

The conductor had been scheduled to tour with an orchestra from the Tanglewood 
Music Center, a summer training center for young musicians where Bernstein 
began his career in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's 72nd birthday is Saturday. The tour was to have included concerts 
in Germany, Austria and Spain.

CBS anchorman Dan Rather and eight CBS staffers, the last U.S. network crew 
still in Iraq covering Persian Gulf crisis developments there, were ordered out 
of Baghdad and left today, CBS said. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS contingent, which includes correspondent Allen Pizzey, now are in 
Amman, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
They had been in Baghdad since Wednesday, arriving a day after an ABC crew led 
by "Nightline" anchorman Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
Koppel left Baghdad on Thursday, and was followed several days later by his ABC 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials made no threats to Rather and his CBS crew in ordering them out 
and just said the journalists had "outstayed their welcome," CBS spokeswoman 
Donna Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told there was a plane out this morning, and we should be on it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraq's action, officials at NBC News and Cable News Network said they 
would continue trying to get their reporters into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw today returned to New York City from 
Saudi Arabia, where he had been anchoring the network's coverage of the 
invasion.

A performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay will go ahead Sunday, but without 
local sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
A Dallas radio station became the fifth group to withdraw as a sponsor for the 
show at the Starplex Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Clay has drawn criticism for offensive references in his stand-up comedy act to 
women, homosexuals and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
KTXQ-FM's action followed the withdrawal of Coca-Cola, Miller beer, WFAA-TV and 
The Dallas Morning News. The five organizations have been season sponsors of 
the theater's summer concert series. 
</P>
<P>
"We sponsor hundreds of concerts every year, and if it's going to alienate 
people, or offend people, it's not in our best interest to sponsor the act," 
said KTXQ program director Andy Lockridge. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Fontana, general manager for Starplex, said the show would go on 
regardless of the number of sponsors. He said ticket sales were good.

GULF CRISIS SENDS '60 MINUTES' TO RATINGS WIN

Bad news in the Persian Gulf has been good news for "60 Minutes," which landed 
in the top spot in the ratings last week, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The first 14 1/2 minutes of the program were devoted to the Persian Gulf, 
including Dan Rather's interview with the Iraqi foreign minister, footage shot 
during an earlier piece on Kuwait, some of it previously unshown, and updates 
from "60 Minutes" anchors Mike Wallace, Morley Safer and Steve Kroft. 
</P>
<P>
"60 Minutes" has been in second place for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had Americans watching more network news than 
network entertainment -- the three-network share of the total television pie 
was 59% for the three evening news programs, but only 54% for prime-time shows. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings was in the No. 1 spot for the 
32nd consecutive week with a 9.7 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the weekly ratings race but boasted only three shows -- "Cheers," 
"Empty Nest" and "Unsolved Mysteries" -- in the top 10, which last week was 
actually the top 11 because of a tie for 10th place.

CBS READIES NEW MONDAY SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CARMODY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CBS has made it official -- it is launching the 1990-91 Monday night schedule 
on Sept. 17. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new "Uncle Buck" -- starring Kevin Meaney as an ill-mannered, irreverent 
uncle raising his late brother's children -- kicks it off at 8 p.m., followed 
by the returning "Major Dad," "Murphy Brown" and "Designing Women." At 10, it 
will be "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," a new entry starring Sharon Gless as a 
racy and rich public defender. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also announced that it is jump-starting "Knots Landing," which will return 
for its 12th season on Thursday, Sept. 13, at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier CBS announced that the new Burt Reynolds 8 p.m. Friday entry, "Evening 
Shade," will debut with a whole hour Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fox Broadcasting is experiencing major production problems with its 
closely watched entry into the Thursday night fracas -- a night that NBC has 
owned lock, stock and Nielsen for some years now. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the strategy was the move of "The Simpsons" from Sunday to 8 
p.m. Thursdays, right smack against NBC's "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's two other regular Thursday entries will be "Babes" and "Class of Beverly 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
But production problems have pushed the premieres of all three shows to 
October. Fox is going ahead this Thursday with reruns of "The Simpsons" as well 
as a rerun of "Married . . . With Children" to fill the time slots. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has taken Fox's Thursday night move very seriously, moving its premiere 
week to this week so that "Ferris Bueller," its upcoming Monday night sitcom, 
could be slipped into the 8:30 time slot this Thursday, presumably to take the 
edge off the Thursday night debuts of the Fox shows. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising Age recently noted that "advertisers are getting uneasy" about the 
production delays at Fox. Although sponsors had been warned that new episodes 
of "The Simpsons" would be delayed, "Babes" was originally supposed to be ready 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
With CBS' baseball playoffs and World Series due in October, as well as the 
formidable NBC lineup, that early start for Fox was deemed critical. This was 
especially so for General Motors, which has to worry, as Ad Age put it, "about 
the possibility of audience under-deliveries in the fall, because of plans for 
new-model introductions and new campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Fox sold $550 million in ad inventory in this year's upfront sales, almost 
double last year's $300 million -- in large part because of the nervy move to 
Thursday against NBC's powerhouse lineup.

ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF WAS ONCE A HARD-CORE REVOLUTIONARY CHIEFTAIN. NOW HE RUNS 
THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. HIS TRANSFORMATION SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE OVERALL CHANGE 
IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY.

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antonio Navarro Wolff has changed, it seems. Not long ago, he was known as a 
steel-eyed guerrilla chieftain, a hard-core revolutionary. Now he is a Cabinet 
minister, soft-spoken and conciliatory, in league with Colombia's political 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it Colombia that has changed? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the interpretation, it is clear that this South American country's 
long history of volatile conflict between rebels and government is moving in 
peaceful new directions. And Navarro, 42, personifies the shift. 
</P>
<P>
He belongs to the April 19 Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps better known simply as M-19, this was the notorious guerrilla group 
that invaded an embassy party in 1980 and for two months held a houseful of 
foreign diplomats hostage, including the U.S. ambassador. It was also the group 
that seized the national Palace of Justice in 1985, resisting an army 
counterattack that left 100 people dead, including 11 members of the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
That same M-19 is now a legal political party and Navarro, its leading figure, 
is minister of health in the new administration of President Cesar Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, M-19 has penetrated the power monopoly always controlled by Gaviria's 
Liberal Party and the opposition Conservatives. On his first day in the 
spacious, carpeted offices he occupies in the Ministry of Health, Navarro noted 
with pride that he is "the first minister in Colombia who is not a Liberal or a 
Conservative." 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the change to peaceful methods in his party's pursuit of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"Every hour has its pursuit, and the pursuit of this hour is peace," he told 
reporters. "I believe the M-19 hit the mark by knowing how to identify that 
moment, by acting in accord with that moment and by knowing that peace was not 
only necessary but also possible." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said he and his party will use their new relationship with government 
to help Gaviria's administration seek peace with the five other guerrilla 
organizations in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we are in a process of reconciliation that is going to be much 
broader than just reconciliation with the M-19, and we are going to make every 
effort to move ahead rapidly," he said. "We are going to help in every possible 
way." 
</P>
<P>
This man of peace sounded like a radically modified version of the Navarro 
described by writer Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza in "Fire Zones," a book about 
guerrillas published just last November. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an ambitious, calculating, intelligent, suffering man with an expression 
of metallic hardness on his face, the archetype of a revolutionary forged in 
his own hot-headed dreams," Mendoza wrote. He said Navarro had been a Maoist 
before joining the M-19 guerrillas, who included both Marxist and non-Marxist 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, who is from a provincial, middle-class family, told The Times that he 
has never belonged to any party other than the M-19, and he avoided calling 
himself a leftist, much less a Maoist. 
</P>
<P>
And while it championed such leftist causes as redistribution of wealth, the 
M-19, formally founded in 1974, has usually been seen as more reformist than 
doctrinaire Marxist, dedicated principally to breaking open Columbia's 
long-closed political system. The group was named after the date in 1970 when 
retired Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, a populist former dictator, lost elections 
that his supporters said were rigged against him. 
</P>
<P>
Although the M-19 has had close connections with the Communist Party of 
President Fidel Castro in the past, Navarro portrayed the Cuban government 
currently as "very isolated and in a difficult situation for international 
relations" -- in other words, not a very appealing role model. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro became an M-19 commander in 1978 after six years as a professor of 
sanitary engineering at Valle University in the city of Cali. He had received 
his engineering degree from the same university and done postgraduate studies 
at the London School of Economics and Loughboro University in England. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Valle, he served as M-19 field commander for two rural fronts. He 
was elected as a member of the national command staff in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The M-19 first signed a peace agreement with the government in 1984. In May, 
1985, during a period of truce, Navarro was having breakfast with friends in a 
Cali cafe when someone threw a grenade that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had more than 100 shrapnel fragments in my arms, my neck, my legs," he 
recalled in an interview for a book on the M-19. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital, he feared another attempt on his life, so he left for Mexico. 
There, his left leg was amputated below the knee. He went to Cuba for further 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
While he was in Havana, on Nov. 6, 1985, a squad of M-19 guerrillas stormed the 
Palace of Justice, the Supreme Court headquarters in downtown Bogota. 
Responding to a question by The Times, Navarro said the takeover was a mistake, 
but he called the army's fiery counterattack a "brutal reaction." 
</P>
<P>
He said he only learned of the takeover from the Cuban press, well after it 
began. "I had nothing to do with that decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro declined to discuss his role in the 1988 kidnaping of Alvaro Gomez, a 
leader of the Conservative Party abducted in support of M-19 demands for new 
peace talks. Navarro was one those charged with the kidnaping, but the charges 
were dropped after the government granted amnesty for political crimes by M-19 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The release of Gomez led to successful peace negotiations that permitted the 
M-19 to become a legal party in March of this year. Its 881 guerrillas accepted 
a government amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
The peace process seemed momentarily to falter when a gunman killed Carlos 
Pizarro, the M-19's top leader and its presidential candidate, a month before 
the May 27 elections. But Navarro, who was No. 2 in the M-19 chain of command, 
finished the campaign as Pizarro's substitute and came in third with 12% of the 
votes. Gomez, on a Conservative splinter ticket, was runner-up to Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro now lives with other M-19 members in a well-guarded house called "The 
Bunker." He and his wife are separated. She lives with their 11-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
As a guerrilla commander, Navarro led rebel fighters in bloody battle; as a 
minister, he commands a bureaucracy of 70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day in office, posing at his desk for news cameras, his frequent 
smiles crinkled the skin around his pale blue eyes and shattered his old image 
of stern severity. A navy blue blazer with brass buttons hung neatly from his 
thin frame, and his necktie was tied just so between the points of his 
button-down collar. 
</P>
<P>
Can the minister keep his rebel idealism from fading amid the trappings of 
power? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the necktie is no more than a necessary convention," he said. "And 
I believe that we are capable -- at least we have been shaped by many years in 
the practice of idealism, also in having our word mean something." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged to root out corruption and political patronage in the Health 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to put gunpowder in their bloomers," he vowed. "This is not going 
to be a quiet ministry. We are going to act where there are problems." 
</P>
<P>
The ministry will give priority to health services for Colombia's poor, he 
promised. "We have an obligation to the poorest people in this country, and we 
are going to fulfill it." 
</P>
<P>
But in a clearly non-leftist tack, he said he would have no problem with 
privatizing a public hospital for the sake of more efficient service. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro acknowledged that doing a good job in the Health Ministry could help 
him and his party in future elections. He repeated a previous prediction that 
the M-19 will be the top contender for the Colombian presidency by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
In the M-19's not-so-recent and radical past, that prospect might have 
disturbed U.S. officials. But a high-ranking American diplomat in Bogota showed 
no concern the other day over Navarro's new position of power and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother us in the least," the diplomat said. "What happened with the 
M-19 was very positive for Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
He said the M-19's success could well lead other guerrillas to lay aside their 
arms and leave behind the warfare that has troubled the country since the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the pursuit of the hour is peace.
