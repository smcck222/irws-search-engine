METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASINO BOMBING FIGURE HELD ON PROBATION 
CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman convicted in the 1980 bombing of a Lake Tahoe casino was arrested 
Tuesday for violation of probation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Jean Williams, 56, was arrested at her Temple City home by Sheriff's 
deputies, Deputy Mary Landreth said. Williams was serving a five-year term of 
probation for her 1985 conviction as an accessory to extortion in the bombing 
of Harvey's Casino in Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was the girlfriend of John Birges Sr., leader of a group that tried to 
extort $3 million from the casino in 1980. Birges and others planted a bomb in 
the hotel and demanded the money, which was never paid. The bomb caused $17 
million in damage, but injured no one.

BORDER AGENTS SEIZE 433 POUNDS OF POT IN 4 INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents in San Diego foiled four marijuana smuggling attempts 
in a 12-hour period, seizing 433 pounds of marijuana valued at more than 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The four unrelated incidents happened between 4 p.m. Monday and 4 a.m. Tuesday, 
said Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them were just stumbled on in one night," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Four men, three of them illegal aliens from Mexico, were arrested during the 
seizures and are being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center on 
suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, Border Patrol agents at the San Onofre checkpoint said 
they found more than 30 pounds of marijuana in a car and arrested Alex Velasco, 
42, of Los Angeles, and Luis Mendival, 22, an illegal alien who had been living 
in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
About four hours later, a Border Patrol agent saw a car drive south and park 
near a closed warehouse near the border on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
When the car didn't come back north, the agent investigated and found it 
abandoned, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
The agent resumed his patrol but later returned to the car. He found a duffel 
bag filled with marijuana in the back seat and three more duffel bags of 
marijuana in the trunk -- a total of 135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
At about 1 a.m. Tuesday, agents from the Imperial Beach station stopped two 
illegal aliens carrying duffel bags across a Little League baseball field about 
three-quarters of a mile north of the Mexican border. Agents found 93 pounds of 
marijuana and a stolen 9-millimeter, semi-automatic pistol. Arrested were 
Javier Guillen, 22, and Jesus Martinez, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later at 4 a.m., other agents from the Imperial Beach station saw a 
car drive through a hole in the border fence south of the 3200 block of 
Monument Road and park in the driveway of a house. 
</P>
<P>
When agents got to the car, the driver was gone but they found a large bag in 
the back seat stuffed with tin cans filled with marijuana. Five more bags of 
marijuana-filled tin cans were found in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always looking for narcotics, and this was a result of that," Swofford 
said, "but we certainly didn't know any of them were coming."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING CODE VIOLATOR, A FUGITIVE 5 YEARS, 
ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who fled five years ago after being convicted of violating Los Angeles 
city building codes has been arrested at his home in San Bernardino County, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Tofi Stephen, 63, was taken into custody at his Rancho Cucamonga residence by 
San Bernardino County marshals after being tracked down by an investigator with 
the Los Angeles city attorney's office, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen was ordered in 1985 to pay $5,326 in fines and penalties after pleading 
guilty to eight violations of various city codes at a four-story apartment 
building he owned at 124 W. 22nd St. He paid only $300 of the fine and twice 
failed to appear in court.

CERULLO WANTS BUYOUT DONATED

<P>
Evangelist Morris Cerullo has asked his supporters to help him raise $52 
million to buy Jim Bakker's old PTL empire and "take back what Satan tried to 
steal," a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo's organization is mailing to 1.5 million households nationwide a slick, 
16-page color magazine that proclaims, "It's time to take back what Satan tried 
to steal." 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, based in San Diego, is asking supporters of his ministry to donate $52 
million in cash before Oct. 23, the closing date set for the sale of the PTL by 
federal bankruptcy authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to communicate to them and bring them along so that they are a 
real part" of what's happening at New Heritage, Cerullo told the Charlotte 
Observer in Tuesday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
"And, of course, they are going to be a real part financially because they are 
going to give very strongly, very substantively to help us take it back," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts also include a 10-part television series detailing his plans for 
the New Heritage USA, Cerullo's name for the 2,200-acre retreat at Ft. Mill, 
S.C., that was built -- and bankrupted -- by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. The 
series is being broadcast on the Inspirational Satellite Network. In addition, 
WCCB-TV in Charlotte is expected to pick up the series beginning Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry also is developing marketing techniques to attract larger donors, 
Cerullo said. 
</P>
<P>
One concept is a "gold card" for ministry partners who give at least $300, he 
said. That would entitle the bearers to 50% off regular hotel room rates and 
admission fees at New Heritage, which combines a theme park and hotel complex. 
</P>
<P>
Also under discussion is a "platinum card" for donors of at least $1,000 that 
would entitle them to one free, three-day, two-night conference, including 
lodging and meals. 
</P>
<P>
A similar plan, for so-called PTL lifetime partners, resulted in Bakker's 
conviction on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Government prosecutors 
contended that Bakker grossly oversold the partnerships. He is serving a 
45-year prison term in a Minnesota federal prison and is appealing his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, is conducting a ministry in a converted warehouse in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, 58, is a Pentecostal preacher whose 30-year-old ministry focuses on 
overseas crusades and training. He was affiliated with the Assemblies of God 
ministry -- the same denomination as Bakker -- but dropped out in 1963.

TIJUANA INMATES AGREE TO END HUNGER STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE MOVE COMES AFTER MEXICAN OFFICIALS PROMISE TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS 
OF ABUSES BY FEDERAL POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most participants in an almost two-month hunger strike at the Baja California 
state penitentiary in Tijuana have suspended their protest and begun to eat 
after Mexican authorities vowed to investigate their allegations of torture and 
other improprieties by Mexican federal police. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 inmates who have agreed to suspend their strike contend that they were 
wrongly jailed by federal authorities, mostly on drug charges -- a common 
allegation in Mexico. Nationwide, there have been widespread allegations that 
federal police have resorted to torture, murder and other unlawful means in an 
effort to make arrests and demonstrate Mexico's commitment to combating 
narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the federal prisoners participating in the strike contend that they 
were beaten into signing false confessions, purportedly spelling out their 
involvement in international drug trafficking networks. 
</P>
<P>
A separate group of about 15 Tijuana prisoners seeking early parole after being 
convicted for a variety of crimes is continuing the hunger strike this week, 
although prison officials said that some or all are expected to be released 
within days. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 prisoners were participating in the strike at one point, although 
the total number had declined to 45 last weekend, strikers said. Most have 
refused food for seven weeks, strikers say, but some joined in later and have 
participated for shorter durations. There are about 2,500 inmates at the 
prison, which was built for 600 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers, who based their protest in and around a two-story gazebo amid the 
crowded grounds of the prison complex, say they have only been taking liquids, 
including honey. A number have been treated at the prison clinic and one 
ex-striker is in grave condition at a Tijuana hospital, with internal wounds 
allegedly inflicted in a police beating. 
</P>
<P>
Among those expressing support for the strikers' cause have been several 
prominent human rights activists and Tijuana Mayor Carlos Montejo Favela, who 
even staged a symbolic hunger strike aimed at demonstrating his sympathy for 
the prisoners' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials have denied any abuse by federal police, contending that 
inmates who say they were wrongly accused have the option of submitting 
evidence of abuse to judges. The inmates contend that Mexican federal judges 
are as corrupt as the federal police and are disinclined to listen to tales of 
official wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend the strike and resume eating was made this past 
weekend, after a government human rights official vowed that officials would 
review the 30 disputed cases, said Valentin Tapia Aguilar, the leader of the 
strikers. The human rights official, who met with the strikers at the 
penitentiary, is a member of a national commission set up earlier this year by 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who created the body in response 
to complaints of abuse by federal police. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers agreed to give government officials until next Tuesday to complete 
their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers also have asked for a broader review of the cases of 763 
non-striking inmates, most of whom were charged with drug trafficking, Tapia 
said. They have expressed the hope that their strike could become a national 
movement, leading to vast reforms of the Mexican criminal justice system.

QUINCE STREET BRIDGE, 1905 LANDMARK, REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic Quince Street footbridge, ravaged by termites and time, reopened 
Tuesday after a two-year closure and a $250,000 restoration. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 dozen people attended a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony at the pedestrian 
bridge across Maple Canyon between 3rd and 4th avenues in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1905 for $805, the wooden trestle bridge was renovated in 1974 and 
1981 and closed in 1987 after city engineers discovered that termites and dry 
rot had weakened the 236-foot structure, rendering it unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council hired a consultant who recommended tearing down the 
bridge and either not replacing it or constructing a steel structure in its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
But area residents, headed by Elinor Meadows, had the bridge designated a city 
landmark and persuaded councilmen to restore it to its original appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth District Councilman Bob Filner presented Meadows with a public service 
award for her effort to save the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"This (award) should go to everyone," Meadows said. "A lot of people worked 
very hard on this (project). I only triggered it." 
</P>
<P>
The renovation, which took three months, was done by the local consulting 
engineering firm of Atkinson, Johnson &amp; Spurrier. The handrails were 
painted Friday, and workers finished cleaning up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the bridge was replaced with pressure-treated Douglas fir, 
including most of the support beams, decking and handrails, said R. Lee 
Biggers, one of the company's structural engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which is 6 feet wide and 60 feet high, will need minimal 
maintenance, primarily periodic repainting of the handrails, said Frank Belock, 
deputy director of engineering design division of the city's Department of 
Engineering and Development. 
</P>
<P>
Belock said the bridge, whose steps are designed to support 100 pounds per 
square foot and the span 85 pounds per square foot, will last several decades 
before any more restoration will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge, situated near Balboa Park, was heavily used by pedestrians for 
several decades, but a 1987 survey showed that fewer than 60 people used it a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said the bridge has invaluable historic significance. There was little 
opposition to the city spending $250,000 from its capital improvements budget 
once the bridge was declared a historic landmark, and 1,000 people signed a 
petition and urged the council to save the structure, Filner added. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't measure its worth. It represents a different pace of life that used 
to be," Filner said, adding that the bridge symbolizes the period before the 
automobile, when walking was more common. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said the figure of 60 users a day was an underestimate and that use 
would increase when the public learns the structure has been reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
After the ribbon-cutting, people walked to the bridge's center and admired the 
view of the winding canyon, which is filled with cactus, palms, bamboo and 
scrub brush and dotted with litter. A utility road cuts through the middle. 
Homeless people camp in the canyon brush. A small part of the San Diego Bay is 
visible to the west. 
</P>
<P>
When the bridge closed in 1987, Meadows, 75, a retired teacher whose home is at 
the canyon's edge, hung large cardboard tears from the trestle to symbolize 
people's sentimental ties with the structure and their concern for its destiny. 
For Tuesday's ceremony, she hung a giant cardboard smile on the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would see this day," said the native San Diegan. "It is old, 
but it is useful, and it would have been a shame to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
The Quince Street footbridge is one of the city's few remaining wooden 
pedestrian bridges. The Vermont Street footbridge, which spanned Washington 
Street in Hillcrest and led to the former site of Sears, was torn down in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Still standing is the Spruce Street Suspension Bridge, a steel cable and 
support structure built in 1922 and renovated in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Quince Street footbridge, designed by city engineer George A. d'Hemecourt 
in 1905, was built at the request of residents who wanted better access to the 
trolley line that ran on 4th Avenue.

GROUP FORMED TO BATTLE NFL 'SCRAMBLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 owners of sports bars and restaurants met Tuesday night in 
Hillcrest to discuss strategies for contesting a lawsuit by Home Box Office and 
fighting the threat by the National Football League to "scramble" its fall 
telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
They emerged from the meeting, which was also attended by eight attorneys, to 
announce the formation of a new organization, the Assn. for Sports Fans' 
Rights, which they hope will gain national backing. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, all present agreed to join together to investigate options that may 
exist, including rallying the customers of the bars and restaurants, as they 
are the ones being denied the games," Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's, 
said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz's comments came in reaction to a suit brought by HBO against the 
owners of more than 30 San Diego sports bars for showing the recent heavyweight 
title bout between Mike Tyson and Henry Tillman, via a Mexican satellite feed. 
The suit, filed Aug. 8 in U.S. District Court, gives the defendants 20 days in 
which to respond. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the NFL stunned owners and customers of sports bars and restaurants 
across the country by announcing it plans to scramble its telecasts beginning 
with the first regular-season game Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said sports bars and restaurants are dependent on showing NFL games by 
use of rooftop "dishes" that pick up the games as they're beamed from 
satellites. The shock of the NFL's announcement was that no descrambling option 
will be available. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get the $3.6 billion the NFL got," Lebovitz said, referring to the 
new four-year network television agreement, "and we're not about to lay down 
and die. Many of us are dependent on these games for our livelihoods. Some 
people will go under if this is enforced." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights plans another meeting next 
week.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL RULES IN SWIM SCHOOL'S FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operator of a North Hollywood swim school should be allowed to stay in 
business despite complaints from some next-door neighbors about noisy children, 
a Los Angeles City Council committee ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Planning and Land Use Management committee was opposed by 
the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., which will appeal it to the full City 
Council on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the homeowners group said they fear that other businesses 
will encroach on the largely residential area if the council allows the Jim 
Herrick Swimming School to remain open in the 11800 block of Kling Street. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't keep commercial businesses out of our residential neighborhoods, 
you'll have a mess -- you'll open Pandora's box," said Lori Dinkin, a Valley 
Village resident and member of the homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about 800 kids a week in a back yard," said next-door neighbor 
Marty Mendenhall. "Obviously, my home life has been disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
Herrick said that until he built a second pool in his back yard, prompting 
complaints to the city from neighbors, he had run the school for about three 
years without a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
He did not know he needed one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes the swim school, recommended 
that the council committee allow the school to remain open, said Tom Henry, his 
planning deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs received 285 letters supporting the school from parents and nearby 
residents and only three from opponents, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
"The school had widespread support and provides a service to the community," 
Henry said. "Allowing it to remain open won't open Pandora's box because we'll 
take other proposals to open businesses on a case-by-case basis."

CHARLES F. DUNCAN; RETIRED ACCOUNTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles F. Duncan, a Burbank accountant for over 30 years, has died at his Sun 
Valley home. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Morehouse, Mo., he died of ataxia, an illness that affects the 
nervous system, said Ruby Duncan, his wife of 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan came to Los Angeles with his family in 1927 and moved to Burbank in 
1936. He was married in 1941 and he and his wife moved to Sun Valley in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
After working at various jobs, which included positions as a manager of a 
Coronet Dime Store and a riveter at Lockheed Corp. during World War II, Duncan 
began working for his stepfather's Burbank accounting business in the late 
1940s. In 1971 he opened his own accounting firm in Burbank, where he worked 
until retiring in 1982. 
</P>
<P>

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PASSERBY FINDS WOMAN REPORTED TO BE MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 40-year-old Chatsworth woman who was reported missing by her boyfriend after 
the two argued in the Malibu hills was found unharmed Tuesday by a passerby 
after search and rescue teams began combing the area, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Thompson was found walking along Kanan Dume Road about 9 a.m. after 
Malibu Search and Rescue Team members and a helicopter began looking for her at 
dawn in an area near Latigo Canyon Road, Deputy Mary Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
A passerby notified the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The searchers feared that Thompson had fallen down a cliff because her 
boyfriend, whose name was not released, had reported that he last saw her 
walking over the crest of a hill that led to a steep drop-off, Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson had stopped her car on Kanan Dume Road about 2:40 a.m., gotten out and 
walked away after arguing with her boyfriend, Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
"She had apparently slipped down the hill," Landreth said. "When her boyfriend 
started looking for her and calling to her, she didn't answer because she 
didn't feel like talking to him. He drove away to get the Sheriff's Department, 
and she climbed up." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson apparently rested in the area until daylight and then started walking 
on Kanan Dume Road, Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
She was spotted about a mile from the search. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth said Thompson was not injured and refused medical attention.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 GANG MEMBERS SENTENCED IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two gang members were sentenced to prison terms Tuesday for the 1989 murder of 
an 18-year-old Tujunga man. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Hernandez, 19, of Sun Valley and Efren Alavarez, 20, of North Hollywood 
pleaded guilty July 23 to killing Thomas Francis Langton as he ran from a Sun 
Valley party in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Langton was at a party in the 7500 block of 
Cartwright Avenue when he was chased and attacked by a group of youths believed 
to be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Langton was beaten and kicked by the youths before he was shot 
several times in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
Alavarez, the gunman in the incident, was sentenced to 17 years to life in 
state prison for second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was sentenced to seven years for voluntary manslaughter.

U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 55-year-old African-American who served four years in the U.S. Navy, I 
find the commentary "Colorblind at the Front Lines," by Charles E. McGee, 
astonishing (Platform, Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
Where is he coming from when he asks an African-American to be colorblind. 
</P>
<P>
America has never had to worry about African-Americans giving 100% effort in 
any war, and it doesn't now. 
</P>
<P>
I hope he is concerned enough and is doing something about the continued racism 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if he thinks Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
has gotten where he is without the decision makers considering his color, he's 
a bigger fool than Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
So, don't worry, Mr. McGee; your black brothers and sisters will follow orders 
as if God were the one who ordered them; and you can go back to your 
second-class living.

I have yet to see anyone suggest internationalizing the Mideast oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
This should be done under United Nations control, if possible, in the name of 
the world economy, world hunger or whatever. Now is the time and we have no 
obligation whatsoever to restore the Kuwaiti rulers to power or to continue 
supporting Saudi and other Arabian rulers to retain their power. Deposing 
Saddam Hussein goes without saying. 
</P>
<P>
The income from the oil could help pay for our military presence and prevent a 
further budget crisis.

AREA TRANSIT PLANNING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Dallos' laudatory description of the recent penchant for toll roads with 
computerized toll collection (Column One, Aug. 14) is misleading. Relative to 
the need for improvement and repair of the nation's overburdened roads and 
bridges, Dallos claims, "With few exceptions, there are no public funds 
available for new facilities." 
</P>
<P>
That just is not so. 
</P>
<P>
In the past the new facilities have been paid for by special assessments, in 
large part, from landowners and developers whose land values skyrocket because 
of the installation of the new facilities; they pay a portion of their 
windfalls for the process under which they are enriched. The new trend, as 
exemplified by our new drastic gasoline-tax increase and the toll-road fad, is 
to exempt the fortunate landowners and raise the revenues through regressive 
consumer taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The burden on American motorists brought about by the Mideast crisis is far 
outweighed by the burden unnecessarily imposed by regressive gasoline taxes and 
toll roads perpetrated on ourselves by ourselves due to ignorance of economics.

Speaking of the 2,500 American "detainees," President Bush said, "Anything that 
compels individuals to do something against their will would, of course, 
concern me." I have to laugh and then cry.

It never seems to bother Bush when he wants to compel several million women to

If we had a sane planetary population policy, we would not need to be in the 
Persian Gulf. What we are watching is the start of the real wars, not for 
politics or ideology, but for real things -- food and energy, natural resources 
and living space. We are fighting like bums over a bottle of wine, but today we 
are billions armed with chemical and nuclear weapons.

In Helena Cobban's column ("Strategic Ally, Strategic Myth," Commentary, Aug. 
16), she attempts to chastise and categorize Israel as more of a burden in the 
Persian Gulf conflict than a strategic asset. Perhaps she needs to be reminded 
that it was Israel that made sure we would not be facing an Iraq armed to the 
teeth with nuclear weapons! Perhaps Ms. Cobban has a reason why she doesn't 
want to remember, or remind us of this?

</P>
<P>
READINESS STILL CARRIES ITS RISKS; 
</P>
<P>
A GREAT HIDDEN DANGER IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY BE ASKING TOO MUCH OF THE 
SYSTEMS WE HAVE CREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARLENE H. ROBERTS, Karlene H. Roberts, professor of business at U.C. 
Berkeley's Walter A. Haas School of Business, focuses her research on the 
design and management of high-reliability organizations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many spheres of life, but particularly in the military, we're building 
organizations that are so technologically advanced that errors can lead to 
catastrophic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The American people will probably respond positively to successful military 
action in the Middle East. It appears equally likely that they will respond 
negatively if something unpredictable happens -- allied ships or planes 
shooting at each other, hitting each other or unintentionally involving a 
noncombatant, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Does the American military have the management capacity to ensure that such a 
catastrophe does not happen? Is anyone really in charge? The predictable 
challenges of operating such complex systems should be considered as important 
as the unpredictable challenges of war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy seems to be one in which American forces are positioned with allies 
to compel the Iraqi government to withdraw from Kuwait. Simple enough? Not so. 
Let us just concern ourselves with what that requires from the Navy (forget the 
Army and Air Force units in Saudi Arabia for the time being). 
</P>
<P>
In the restricted waters around the Straits of Hormuz (at the entrance to the 
Persian Gulf), we have the aircraft carrier Independence and its attendant 
support ships. The Saratoga is in the eastern Mediterranean. The Eisenhower, a 
nuclear-powered ship with more staying power than the Independence or Saratoga, 
is in the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer awesomeness of such ships suggests some of the management problems 
each carrier battle group faces. Ship's company and the air wing of each 
carrier is composed of about 5,500 men. Each aircraft carrier has approximately 
85 to 90 planes of seven different types, each with different capabilities and 
functions. Nuclear carriers can operate for about 13 years without refueling, 
but aviation fuel must be replenished at least once a week. About 200,000 
gallons of jet fuel are required for a normal strike operation 500 miles from 
the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the Kennedy and its support ships. While not as large as the Eisenhower, 
this carrier is bigger than the Saratoga or Independence. But like the Saratoga 
and Independence, the Kennedy is conventionally fueled. 
</P>
<P>
We now have four battle groups (carriers and their escorts), bringing the 
number of ships under U.S. control to about approximately 40 and the number of 
sea-based aircraft aboard the carriers alone to about 345. This is in addition 
to other Navy ships and aircraft on station or under way. To keep the men 
aboard each carrier and the hundreds more aboard the escort ships fed and 
moving, stores and fuel must be replaced frequently. That is a complicated 
management operation, too. Replenishing requires that the carrier and its 
replenishment ship travel "abeam" at about 12 knots, a situation fraught with 
vulnerability and the threat of potential collision (the U.S. Navy does many 
at-sea replenishments every day without incident). Replenishing other ships is 
associated with similar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the British and the French navies. We often practice with the British. 
And those practices (and our own individual practices) uncover numerous 
problems. Some, but not all, of these problems are solved in exercises. Now 
enter the Soviet Navy. Readiness in the Soviet fleet is considerably different 
from readiness in our own. Their organization is structured differently 
(including political officers aboard ships). The Soviets sacrifice operations 
at sea for material readiness. They go for low wear-and-tear and close 
proximity to supporting bases. They also rely less on training than we do. 
</P>
<P>
Managing this geographically dispersed enterprise seems challenging enough. 
Managing a situation in which the average age of the American crews is about 
20, and their turnover rate is just 44 months, seems impossible. One of the 
great hidden dangers of this entire enterprise lies in the possibility that we 
may simply be asking too much of the systems we have created. 
</P>
<P>
The government and people of the United States demand quality operations from 
our Navy. All in all, we've provided fair resources for obtaining "readiness." 
But because of resource constraints, the Navy usually practices joint 
activities with two and sometimes three battle groups, rarely practices with 
four, almost never practices with numerous battle groups and our allies, and 
certainly never practices with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
As a society, we place large and risky demands on complex military systems and 
expect them not to fail. But when we operate them overtime at their limits, we 
increase the likelihood of failure. When we introduce untested challenges, we 
further increase the risk. In actual combat, some failures are virtually 
guaranteed. How will this risk-averse society react to that?

CRIMES PETTY, BUT NOT HIS WARRANT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When San Diego police officers caught up with 23-year-old Antonio Anthony 
Simpson, they were planning to give him a routine misdemeanor citation on 
suspicion of breaking into a change box at a downtown parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
But, after running a records check on the transient Monday morning, police 
wasted no time in taking him to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The police computer worked for more than an hour and a half churning out 
information showing that Simpson was wanted on 45 outstanding misdemeanor 
warrants for failing to appear in court -- a bail bill that totaled $182,990, 
police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's prior warrants, all issued within the past couple of years, included 
citations for petty theft, public drunkenness, possession of narcotics 
paraphernalia and a slew of other misdemeanors, police spokesman Bill Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson had been cited on suspicion of a similar petty theft just last week, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being carted off to jail, people suspected of misdemeanors are 
usually cited, much as if they had been stopped for speeding. They must sign a 
ticket promising to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
But police and the city attorney's office say there is another reason Simpson 
has been able to elude jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Overcrowding is the real reason Simpson is not in jail," Robinson said. "It 
has to be a felony to be booked into the County Jail." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office, which prosecutes misdemeanors, said cases involving 
people with a backlog of failure-to-appear warrants are not out of the 
ordinary. Simpson's number was unusually high, however. 
</P>
<P>
Meagan Beale, a senior screening and arraignment deputy for the city attorney's 
office, estimated that only 25% of the people scheduled to appear in court for 
misdemeanors ever do. When a person fails to appear, an arrest warrant is 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
"In practical matters, nothing will happen after (they don't show up in court), 
because the officers are so busy with felonies," Beale said. "Even if they did 
arrest you, they wouldn't have anywhere to keep you anyway."

GRAHE GETS RUDE LESSON IN ANGELS' LOSS TO TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Falling behind hitters is a failing not allowed rookie pitchers, as Angel 
right-hander Joe Grahe learned in his second major league start. 
</P>
<P>
"The good hitters are going to take advantage of it," Grahe said. "It's 
something to file away." 
</P>
<P>
Grahe filed it under "M" for the mauling Lloyd Moseby and the Detroit Tigers 
inflicted in 2 2/3 innings Tuesday. Moseby drove in Detroit's first three runs 
with a triple, scored the fourth and homered for the fifth, leading the Tigers 
to a 6-2 rout at Tiger Stadium and saddling Grahe (0-1) with his first major 
league loss. 
</P>
<P>
Grahe got ahead of Detroit's first two hitters Tuesday. He had a 1-and-2 count 
on Tony Phillips before Phillips singled to left and an 0-and-2 count on Travis 
Fryman before hitting Fryman on the left arm. "Then you're sitting there and 
looking at the teeth of their lineup," pitching coach Marcel Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
Grahe walked major league home run leader Cecil Fielder on four pitches to load 
the bases. That brought up Moseby, who took the first pitch for a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been around long enough to know I was going to have to come after him," 
Grahe said. "Hey, I'm not the first guy he's done this to and I won't be the 
last." 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the few Moseby has done it to recently, however. Moseby was three 
for 32 before lacing the next pitch over the head of center fielder Max Venable 
to drive in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine he might have been nervous. I can remember back when I was a rookie. 
It had to be nerve-racking," said Moseby, who scored when Grahe didn't field 
Dave Bergman's grounder cleanly and was able only to get a force at second on 
Larry Sheets, who had walked. "I was guessing fastball, as any hitter would in 
that situation, and I'm a fastball hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like a pretty good pitcher. You can put one up for me, but he'll be 
back. I'm sure we'll meet again and fight again." 
</P>
<P>
Moseby won their second meeting, too, lining an 0-and-1 pitch into the right 
field seats for his 12th home run and a 5-1 Tiger lead. It was more than enough 
for former Angel Dan Petry (10-9), who reached double figures in victories for 
the first time since he won 15 in 1985 with the Tigers. Detroit traded him to 
the Angels for Gary Pettis in December of 1987 and re-signed him last January 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't complain about the offensive support I've gotten all year. I've gotten 
my share of runs," said Petry, who went five innings before yielding to Paul 
Gibson and Edwin Nunez. "There's a lot of guys here who can drive in runs." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a few chances to get back into the game but took themselves out 
of it. They scored once in the third inning on a two-out walk by Luis Polonia 
-- his first walk in 106 at-bats since July 15 -- an infield hit by Pete 
Coachman and Venable's double, but Coachman was thrown out over-running third. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield led off the fourth inning with his 15th home run of the season, 
and the Angels managed to load the bases after two out on singles by Lance 
Parrish and Donnie Hill and a walk to Dick Schofield. But Phillips, a late 
replacement at second when Lou Whitaker begged off because of a sore knee, 
defused the threat by moving quickly to his left to scoop up a grounder by 
Polonia and get the fleet outfielder at first by a step. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers scored in the fourth against relief pitcher Cliff Young. Right 
fielder Dante Bichette slipped and couldn't catch Phillips' fly-ball double, 
and Phillips went to second on a wild pitch and scored the Tigers' sixth run on 
Alan Trammell's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"You can break the game down in probably three or four different things," 
Manager Doug Rader said. "The (12) men we left on base, a three-run swing in 
the fourth inning -- Phillips catches the ball Polonia hits and Dante slips on 
Phillips' ball -- Grahe got ahead of the first two hitters and lost both and 
really wasn't able to recover, and Moseby accounts for five runs. There it is 
in outline form." 
</P>
<P>
No one had to outline for Grahe the areas in which he must improve. 
</P>
<P>
"What hurt me today was my inability early to get my off-speed stuff over," the 
23-year-old right-hander said. "I didn't make the adjustments I needed to make 
quick enough, and that's something I can take into my next start. I feel once 
I'm able to make the correct adjustments as far as what's working and not 
working, and once I'm able to get the stuff that's not working to work, I can 
win here." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Young and Mike Fetters pitched well in relief of Joe Grahe, with Young 
giving up one run and striking out three in 3 1/3 innings. Young entered the 
game with runners on first and second in the third inning and retired the first 
batter he faced, the first time in six appearances he had done so. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned you've got to bear down a little harder and make your pitches 
because you always want to get that first guy out with runners on base," Young 
said after his first appearance since Aug. 12. "I was getting behind and giving 
hitters their pitch. I was able to bear down tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis and Brian Downing were held out of Tuesday's game, Davis because of 
stiffness in his lower back and Downing because of his chronic rib muscle 
ailment. Davis was on the disabled list from July 17 to Aug. 9 because of back 
problems, so extra precaution was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill returned after missing two games because of a strained left 
hamstring. . . . Pitcher Bert Blyleven, who was placed on the disabled list 
Sunday, is following a strengthening program in Anaheim with physical therapist 
Roger Williams. . . . Pitcher Greg Minton was sent to double-A Midland on a 
rehabilitation assignment and is scheduled to pitch today. . . . Pete Coachman 
has two hits in each of the four games he has played since being recalled from 
triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette is again taking grounders at third and is the emergency third 
baseman behind Coachman and Hill. "He has the physical tools and the ability to 
do it," Rader said. "Willingness is the first step and he has that." 
</P>
<P>
Tiger first baseman Cecil Fielder struck out twice for a season total of 142, 
surpassing the club record of 141 set by Jake Wood in 1961.

11-1 LEAD ISN'T ENOUGH; DODGERS LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The Philadelphia Phillies, thanks to poor relief pitching and two errors by 
rookie Jose Offerman, scored two runs in the eighth inning and nine runs in the 
ninth to defeat the Dodgers, 12-11, in Dodger Stadium Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 11-1, the Phillies scored their two runs in the eighth against Don 
Aase on a two-run double by Von Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the big blow coming on a three-run pinch-homer by John Kruk against 
Tim Crews, they added nine in the ninth. Offerman, the rookie shortstop, 
mishandled two grounders in the inning that led to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ninth, it had seemed the Dodgers could do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
They began their their second-biggest inning of the season with a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Their catcher committed two errors in the first three innings and was a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Their most applauded pinch-hitter was a pitcher, who responded with his second 
consecutive pinch-hit this season. 
</P>
<P>
The National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds beat the Chicago Cubs, 8-1, 
Tuesday. The Dodgers needed to win to go six games above .500 for the first 
time this season and remain 5 1/2 games out of first place. They have one game 
remaining against the Phillies before a four-game weekend showdown here against 
the NL East contending New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Before 39,682 at Dodger Stadium, the offense pounded three Phillies pitchers 
while helping Mike Hartley survive early jitters. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' eight-run fifth inning started with a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a 3-1 lead after four innings, the uprising began against reliever 
Bruce Ruffin, who had already replaced Jason Grimsley, who gave up three runs 
in three innings in his his third major league start. 
</P>
<P>
It began on a swinging third strike by Kirk Gibson. The ball eluded catcher 
Darren Daulton, and Gibson ran to first base, courtesy of a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers would score seven runs before the Phillies could make another out. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels singled. Eddie Murray walked. Hubie Brooks hit a slow roller that 
was mishandled by third baseman Charlie Hayes for an error, scoring one run. 
</P>
<P>
This brought up catcher Mike Scioscia, who made his seventh and eighth errors 
in the second and third innings on bad throws during stolen base attempts. The 
Phillies only run had resulted from one of those throws, when Tommy Herr went 
to third on his second-inning error and scored on a single by Dickie Thon. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia had already made up for that run with a bases-loaded, two-run single 
in the third. But apparently he did not think it was enough, as he lined a 
double into the left-center field gap in the fifth to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, in 16 at-bats with the bases loaded, Scioscia has seven hits for a 
.438 average, with 18 RBIs. As a team with the bases loaded, the Dodgers are 
batting .370 with the bases loaded, with 90 RBIs in 100 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
But Scioscia's hit was just the beginning for the Dodgers, not to mention the 
end for Ruffin. Against just-entered reliever Darrel Akerfelds, Mike Sharperson 
followed with a grounder that shortstop Dickie Thon threw late to the plate in 
an attempt to get Brooks. All runners were safe, and it just got worse. 
</P>
<P>
The bases were loaded on a fielding error by Akerfelds on a bunt by Hartley. 
Lenny Harris then drove in two runs with a single, and, two batters later, a 
grounder by Stan Javier scored the final run. The inning amounted to eight 
Dodger runs, five unearned, on five hits with two errors and three left. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley needed nothing more, as he was removed from the game after six innings 
having allowed just one runs on two hits. His only trouble was walks in each of 
the first three innings, but only one scored, as the Phillies stranded four 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' final insult came in the eighth, when Fernando Valenzuela hit a 
pinch single against Roger McDowell. In his only other pinch-hit attempt this 
year, Valenzuela, batting .288, doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were enthused with Hartley, who has won four consecutive decisions, 
two as a starter, with an 0.75 ERA as a starter. But they might also be worried 
about the middle relievers in their bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies scored twice on three hits against Aase in the eighth inning, 
featuring a two-run double by Von Hayes after singles by Dave Hollins and Lenny 
Dykstra. The single by Dykstra came on his first at-bat with Rick Dempsey 
catching since the two players fought at home plate Monday night. There were 
many oohs from the crowd, but there was no incident. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, the Phillies chased reliever Dave Walsh who, despite having an 
eight-run lead, walked the leadoff hitter Rod Booker. Thon and Hollins followed 
with run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel didn't start for a third consecutive game. The second baseman has 
three hits in his last 22 at-bats. . . . Alfredo Griffin returned to the 
starting lineup after sitting for two games while rookie shortstop Jose 
Offerman played in his first two major league games. Offerman could still end 
up starting at least as many games as Griffin in the final six weeks of the 
season.

BACK TO HIS FUTURE;

<P>
TOMMY BOOKER, HAVING RUN THE DETOURS, TRIES TO FIND HIS WAY INTO SDSU'S 
BACKFIELD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tommy Booker could always run. 
</P>
<P>
To him, football at Vista High School was pretty basic stuff. He did the tricks 
and worked the magic; his opponents played out the part of the buffoons. He 
could always run away from opposing tacklers. Give him the smallest opening, 
and boom, there he went. Through the line, into the secondary and toward a 
terrific future. 
</P>
<P>
College recruiters visited by day and telephoned by night. Parade magazine 
picked him first-team All-American. He was rated as the top recruit in the 
nation by the Dallas Morning News and ranked the fifth-best high school senior 
in the country by the National High School Recruiting Service. 
</P>
<P>
His classmates all knew him -- or of him. Those he didn't know whispered in the 
halls as he walked by. That's him. Some day, he's going to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
That's what everyone thought, and why not? He was big and strong, quick and 
fast. Durable. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along the line, something happened, something nobody can 
understand unless they've been the talk of the school, the target of the 
recruiters, the subject of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
You see, when a football game began to speed up during crunch-time, Tommy 
Booker would take the ball, hug it against his body and take off toward another 
touchdown. But when his life began to speed up, it wasn't so easy. There were 
no timeouts or two-minute drills. He couldn't ask the quarterback to throw the 
ball out of bounds and stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Life started going faster and faster, and he couldn't slow it down, and there 
were so many choices to make, and suddenly . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was about the time he arrived at San Diego State, in the fall of 1987, that 
his life began turning into one big broken play. A gap opened up the middle, 
but Booker cut left. A wedge formed around left end, but Booker slashed right. 
</P>
<P>
Some of it was his fault. Some just happened. Injuries. Personal problems. A 
pregnancy. A marriage. Fatherhood. Confusion. A decision to redshirt last 
season. A nagging feeling in the back of his mind causing him to wonder if he 
ever wanted to carry a football again. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one night last fall, while he watched the Aztecs play Brigham Young, his 
desire returned. He talked with SDSU Coach Al Luginbill. He was back with the 
program in time for practice last spring. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled a hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't all. In the middle of spring practice and during finals week, his 
wife of two years told him she wanted a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
And now, another season has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Booker is back at it, practicing under the hot sun, running, blocking, 
working. He has not been unlike Sisyphus, the Greek mythological figure who was 
sentenced to roll a boulder uphill for the rest of his life; just when he 
neared the top, the boulder rolled back downhill, and he started all over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
What's done is done. Booker practices, in the familiar No. 29 jersey, and he 
talks, in the familiar voice that is not much more than a whisper. He is 
entering his junior year of eligibility, and there is no guarantee how much 
playing time he will get. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have four running backs in the picture -- Booker, community college 
transfer T.C. Wright, Curtis Butts and redshirt freshman Kipp Jeffries. Coming 
out of the spring, Wright was No. 1 on the depth chart. Luginbill says Booker, 
6-feet, 200 pounds, is in the hunt, but still. . . . Much of the glitter is 
gone. You get the impression that this is a man whose future is slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about that," Booker said. "Some people do stuff in high school, as 
far as playing ability, and some people do stuff in college. I don't know when 
mine is supposed to stop. Maybe here. Maybe in the next level. We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
During his senior year at Vista in 1986, he rushed for 2,124 yards, then a San 
Diego County record. USC, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Auburn were among those who 
called. His decision came down to three schools. He liked SDSU and Washington. 
His father pushed for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things happened too fast," said Thomas Booker, Tommy's father. "He 
didn't have time to sort them out. It was overwhelming for us. We had a very 
difficult time during that time. I can imagine the stress he was going through. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ever have another son (in that situation), it will never happen like 
that. It was too much." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tommy Booker held a press conference and announced his decision: SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
When you're a schoolboy legend, and you elect to play your football at home, 
the only thing left to do is step into the starting lineup and rumble for 
several hundred more yards. 
</P>
<P>
That's not what happened. 
</P>
<P>
He sprained an ankle in 1987, his freshman year. While he sat, junior Paul 
Hewitt established himself as SDSU's leading rusher. So, come Booker's 
sophomore year, he sat again. Both years, though, he was the Aztecs' 
second-leading rusher. In 1987, he gained 246 yards, and he rushed for 214 more 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest moment of glory came during his freshman season in 1987 when he ran 
65 yards for an apparent touchdown during a 47-14 loss at UCLA. Glory? It was 
nullified by a penalty. Figures. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another play that Booker remembers more, the one that preceded the 
65-yard run. Booker took a handoff from quarterback Todd Santos, started up the 
middle and was met by UCLA strong safety Carnell Lake, who makes his living 
these days playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
"All I remember seeing is Carnell Lake," he said. "When I seen him, it was too 
late. I wasn't low enough, and he put me straight up on my back. Maybe that's 
why I got the 65-yarder on the next play. I said, 'I'm not going to do this 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is the moment Booker remembers most about his college career. Welcome to 
college football, kid. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't easy years. There were nagging injuries -- the ankle, a hamstring, 
a shoulder. And when people who knew him would ask why he wasn't starting, 
there wasn't much to do but look down at his feet and start his answer with 
something like: "Well, uh, you know. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He decided to redshirt in 1989. He had pulled a hamstring again, and he had 
some personal problems that he still will not discuss. Regardless of what was 
bothering him, he had developed a reputation as a guy who was always hurt and 
didn't want success badly enough. Booker won't argue with the reputation. Maybe 
success had come too easily to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say I haven't played hard," he said. "But I would say I haven't 
been fully dedicated as far as being the best player I can be." 
</P>
<P>
He thought long and hard about whether he even wanted to play football again. 
He thought about his priorities. Then, he looked at his 2-year-old daughter, 
Desiree. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about dropping out of football completely," he said. "But if I 
did, I don't know if I could have continued in school. If I didn't go to school 
and get a degree, then what? A mediocre job? My daughter deserves more than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what can happen if you do well on the football field. Other 
opportunities may come up." 
</P>
<P>
So he continued -- he is majoring in physical education -- and, toward the end 
of last season, during that BYU game, he decided no, this wasn't the way he 
wanted to finish his football career. He informed Luginbill he would join the 
team in time for spring practice, which began last April. 
</P>
<P>
A talk with a neighbor had helped as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with a friend of mine, Mike," Booker said. "He said, 'If you 
don't go all out and prove yourself, you will doubt yourself once you get out 
of school and stop playing college football.' He basically said give it all 
you've got, and you'll feel confident in knowing you tried to do your best. I 
thought about that a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Spring practice started, and then his wife, Adrienne, told him about the 
divorce. They had been separated for about a month, but Booker said he figured 
they would get back together. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I didn't think she was serious," he said. "But I could tell by the 
look on her face afterward that she was. I thought we could work it out, but 
then again. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Booker and Adrienne had started dating during his senior year of high school. 
They were married on Valentine's Day, 1987. He was a star football player who 
had just finished his freshman season at SDSU. She was four years younger and a 
month or two pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Booker talks of his attachment to his daughter. He says that he still wishes he 
and Adrienne could work things out. 
</P>
<P>
"That was very tough for him, being a young, dedicated father," Booker's father 
said. "We compliment him highly on being so dedicated to his family and baby. 
He didn't want the divorce. He protested. But he's had to submit to it. It's a 
hard problem to have. But his focus on football and school is pretty strong. 
He's determined he is going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk a lot now. At one time, we went through the father-son breakaway 
thing. He was trying to claim his own identity. . . . (Now) He's the son I 
always knew. At one time, I thought maybe I had a stranger. Now, we have a 
close relationship. We talk quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
A harsh reality of divorce sometimes is child support, and that's the wild card 
in this one. The thing is, NCAA rules stipulate that athletes cannot work 
during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know," Booker's father said. "His lawyer says, yes, there is a good 
possibility that they might tell him to get a job and support his family. Which 
I can understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that's not the case. I hope she will be a little considerate toward 
what he is trying to accomplish and allow him to finish his education and his 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Booker has moved back home with his parents, and says he has worked out an 
arrangement in which they will help him with child support. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be no problem," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks he finally has turned things around. He says he feels good -- both 
physically and mentally. Unlike personal problems in the past, he says, the 
divorce is not going to affect him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say it's tough right now, but it's not affecting me on the 
field or in the classroom," he said. "I've had a lot of help getting through 
this -- from my parents, my church and my pastor, and my friends." 
</P>
<P>
He talks of rediscovering Christ, a part of his life he says he abandoned after 
high school. He says that because of that, his mind is at ease. 
</P>
<P>
He also says he worked out harder this summer than in any in the past. He and a 
group of local athletes, including offensive lineman Jack Harrington, a former 
Rancho Buena Vista All-County player who is now playing at Hawaii, worked out 
at RBV. 
</P>
<P>
And while working on the hamstring, Booker didn't miss any rehabilitation 
appointments with SDSU doctors. Head trainer Brian Barry said the strength in 
Booker's hamstring is 90%, a significant increase from a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easy for him to crack the starting lineup. The top four running 
backs have all impressed Luginbill. Wright broke eight school records at Mesa 
Community College last season, rushing for 1,073 yards, and was named community 
college All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Butts is the only returning running back to have played for the Aztecs in 1989, 
and he has taken advantage of limited opportunities. He rushed for 156 yards on 
17 carries against New Mexico last season. Jeffries had a good spring and tied 
Butts for the No. 2 running back spot. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Booker. And there is not much room in the Aztecs' one-back 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy has got to have a good fall camp," Luginbill said. "He knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Booker: "I don't know if it's been decided that T.C. is the No. 1 guy 
right now. If I get a chance to show something or prove something, I'm going to 
do it, 110%. That's what they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
"To play at this level, you're going to have to give an extra push. (Before) I 
just did what I needed to to get by. Now, I hate to be doubted -- can he play 
or what?" 
</P>
<P>
There is still talk when Tommy Booker walks by, but now, people see Booker and 
whisper things about how he is washed up and what a disappointment he has been. 
As if he personally let them down or something. 
</P>
<P>
Booker hears the whispers and sees the looks. Sure, it bothers him, but he has 
discovered that all of life isn't lived over 100 yards, from goal-line to 
goal-line. He is just a kid, 22, who happened to be a pretty good football 
player. He has been disappointed, too, during the past couple of years, and he 
has learned that things don't always work out as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things I've learned to live with," he said. "Everything 
don't go your way all of the time. The coaches tell me if things don't go my 
way, to work through them. That's what I'm trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
So he straps on his shoulder pads and buckles his helmet, searching for another 
year or two of magic and hoping his talent supply has not run dry. 
</P>
<P>
There are 2 1/2 weeks left before the Aztecs open the season at Oregon. Booker 
is still running, hoping to catch up to his past before it disappears 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs will hold their first scrimmage of the fall at 3:20 p.m. this 
afternoon on the lower practice field at SDSU. They will also hold their normal 
practice this morning at 8:40 a.m. As for the scrimmage, SDSU Coach Al 
Luginbill said there will be officials and the team will run 100-125 plays. "It 
will be very, very simple from both sides of the ball," Luginbill said. "It's 
our first time out, we don't want to get too fancy. We'll run our basic offense 
-- quick passing, we'll run the ball. We will not run a lot of our double tight 
ends.". . . . Linebacker Lou Foster (hamstring) will not participate in the 
scrimmage, linebacker Sai Niu (hamstring) is doubful, defensive back Zac Stokes 
(bruised shoulder) is questionable and linebacker Andy Coviello (hip flexor) is 
probable. . . . Luginbill said he has started drilling the team on rules 
changes for the coming year, the main one being that the defense can return a 
fumble in front of the line of scrimmage beginning this year. If there is a 
fumble in the backfield, the defense is still not allowed to advance the ball. 
. . . Luginbill on what he plans to do Sunday, the Aztecs' last day off before 
opening the season Sept. 8: "I'm going to go home and hug my wife. It's her 
birthday, and I haven't seen her anywhere but here (at SDSU) for two weeks."

FISHING REPORT: SILVERWOOD TROUT PLANTS FATTEN CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excessive trout plants have led to vastly improved fishing at Silverwood Lake, 
one of the Southland's primary striped bass fisheries.

The Mojave River State Fish Hatchery, scheduled to close in October, has been 
"over-stocking" various reservoirs in order to remove the facility's 200,000 
pounds of catchable and sub-catchable trout. 
</P>
<P>
Jeane Bryant said the San Bernardino County reservoir is being "overrun" with 
trout as a result. The stripers are feeding on the trout and the fishermen are 
in turn catching the frenzied stripers. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Beck of Glendora took a 19-pound striper from the channel. Irene Simpson 
of Downey caught a 19-pounder at Outhouse Cove and Dave Daval of Hesperia 
landed a 17-pound fish in the spillway.

IN BATTLE OF OLD MAN AND THE SEA, ANGLER, 81, IS A WINNER

Bill Coombs is 81, but the Australian proved this week that age is not a factor 
when he competed in the 32nd Hawaiian International billfish tournament off 
Kailua-Kona. 
</P>
<P>
Coombs caught a 592-pound blue marlin Monday, putting his Gamefish Club of 
South Australia into the lead after the first day of the event. 
</P>
<P>
The three-man team was reduced to two before competition began when one member, 
Ron Johnson, suffered broken his ribs in an accident. And Coombs was fishing 
alone Tuesday after his other teammate, John Johnston, lost part of a thumb 
when it got caught in a rope while the crew was hauling Coombs' fish aboard 
Monday. Johnston was treated and released at the Kona Hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy's out there battling the ocean alone," Johnston said Tuesday from his 
hotel room at the King Kamehameha Hotel. "I don't know whether I'll do any 
fishing tomorrow, but I'll certainly be out there . . . appraising the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hal Wood, in charge of public relations for the event: "This is a contact 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Wood said that the tournament director, Roy Morioka, was slightly injured 
Monday when a chain from a hoist fell on his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he got a puka in the head," Wood said. Puka is Hawaiian for hole. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Peter Goadby of Australia suffered broken legs when he fell off a 
cliff while taking a picture on the final day of the tournament. He is back 
this year as chief judge, serving from a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
With 100 bonus points each for the day's biggest fish and for a fish of more 
than 500 pounds, and a 33% bonus because he was using 50-pound line, Coombs' 
club earned 989 points. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 marlin and five ahi, or yellowfin tuna, were caught Monday. The 
yellowfin, caught by Carlos Valenzuela of Guatemala's Club Nautico, took five 
hours to bring in and weighed 153 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nine marlin had been boated by Tuesday afternoon but the day's final results 
were not immediately available. Friday is the last day of the 85-team 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The California Fish and Game Commission will meet in special session today to 
adopt regulations for the dove and band-tailed pigeon seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Two anti-hunting groups, Fund for Animals and Animal Legal Defense Fund, were 
successful in stopping archery hunting of bears two weeks ago and have filed 
comments in opposition to the proposed migratory bird hunting regulations. They 
can challenge Fish and Game's environmental document under terms of the 
California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
The dove hunt, popular among California hunters, would start Sept. 1 -- time 
enough, both sides say, for all of the legal exercises to be performed either 
to save it or sack it. But if there is a hunt, experts say, it should be a good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
David Whiteside, who runs the private Antelope Valley Sportsmen's Club, said: 
"There's more doves than I've seen in seven to 10 years."

The grass proved greener for SURELOCK on the Del Mar turf last week. The 
computer's bets piled up the biggest bankroll ever in this friendly 
handicapping competition, dating through the Hollywood Park meeting. 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's bets for today are a $10 exacta box, Keep On Top-Crystal Bounty, in 
the third race; $40 to win and place on Desert Rumor and a $10 exacta box, 
Desert Rumor-Dirty Old Man-Front Line Ready, in the seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll $2,484 
</P>
<P>
Janice Goldinger, seemingly in the role of steady ant contrasting to SURELOCK's 
grasshopper, will bet $40 to win on Swifterthanthewind and a $5 exacta box, 
Swifterthanthewind-Bold Liloy, in the fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll $1,479.75 
</P>

LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
DONALD DANCER, MEMBER OF FAMED HARNESS FAMILY, WILL CHALLENGE LOCAL DRIVING 
TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On July 3, 1970, Donald Dancer climbed into the sulky behind a trotter named 
Sioux Grandchamp and steered him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
The precocious Dancer was 14 years old. His first parimutuel triumph came in a 
special race for amateur drivers that was part of Grand Circuit Week at Goshen, 
N.Y., home of the Hall of Fame of the Trotter. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Dancer is moving his future Hall of Fame credentials from 
New York to Los Alamitos for a 42-night meet that opens Friday and extends 
through Oct. 20. Dancer has never driven at the Orange County oval before. 
</P>
<P>
Dancer is a member of one of the most famous families in harness racing. His 
father, Vernon, was a top driver for years before a leg injury restricted him 
to training. His uncle, Stanley, is one of the most illustrious trainer-drivers 
of modern times and is already in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Dancer, 34, has won more than 3,500 races -- 1,200 ahead of any Los Alamitos 
rival -- and earned nearly $20-million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, 158-pounder has been a leading driver on the New Jersey, Delaware 
Valley and New York circuits. He hit a personal high of $3.2 million in purses 
in 1988 and has been a top driver at Yonkers Raceway in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, I earned $3.2 million with almost as many wins (371). This year I've 
earned slightly over $1-million (after seven months). Each year the purses have 
gone down at Yonkers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm looking to make a change. It's a career move. I've heard 
nothing but great things about this place, and that's rare in this business. 
It's one of the few tracks that's way up." 
</P>
<P>
Dancer moved his wife, Renee, and their daughters -- Desiree, 5, and Scarlett, 
3 -- to Los Alamitos this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bringing three horses of my own but I'll mostly catch-drive (drive for 
other trainers)," Dancer said. "Nick Sodano, one of the leading trainers at the 
Meadowlands, is sending out TK's Skipper and Conditional, both powerhouses, for 
the American Racing Classic, as well as a couple of others. Jack Wyatt is 
sending out two or three, and Andy Getz six or seven. I should have about 17 to 
start with." 
</P>
<P>
Dancer has won several major stakes, including the Levy final with Dragon's 
Lair and the U.S. Pacing Championship with Play The Palace in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The race that meant the most was in 1983 at Freehold (N.J.) with Valley 
Jewel," the New Jersey native said. "The race was named the Helen Dancer 
Memorial for my grandmother. My father trained the horse. We beat Turn The 
Tide, the heavy favorite. The whole family was there." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos, proudly toured the 
refurbished facility this week. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant improvement is a new paddock at the end of the grandstand 
that Arnold hopes will be completed early in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get fan participation back," Arnold said. "We're trying to get 
the public closer to the horses to see and hear what's going on. It's always 
been a mystery what's going on in the receiving bar. Now they can see for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The brightly lit area contains 30 cinderblock stalls on a Tartan surface. 
"That's enough for three races," said Arnold. "I think we can cut down time 
between races from 17 minutes to 12. That can save an hour on each program. We 
can get the fans out at 10 on weeknights and at 11 on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
An adjacent drivers' room, measuring 4,200 square feet, is also near 
completion. It is divided into men's and women's quarters and is equipped with 
a sauna. 
</P>
<P>
The clubhouse boasts the Finish Line Room, a plush non-smoking room that has 
table space for 400 people with buffet food service, betting windows and 
television monitors. A trackside deck is projected next year. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the grandstand has been repainted with light colors and 65 new 
television monitors have been added. A new sports bar is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold moved to the second level of the grandstand. Behind him, workers painted 
the inner rail. A new pink flower bed forming the letters LARC adorned an area 
in front of the toteboard. Arnold pointed to an area where construction is 
scheduled to begin Dec. 1 on a glass-enclosed clubhouse that will seat 1,250. 
"And two years after we've built our new grandstand, we'll be the No. 1 harness 
track in the United States," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos became the first inter-track wagering site in Orange County Sunday 
when it began to handle Del Mar thoroughbred action the day after the 
conclusion of the Orange County fair meet. With free parking and free general 
admission for the opener, a crowd of 6,069 wagered $1,071,399. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's afternoon schedule continues through Sept. 12, meaning 11 times when 
both tracks will be open on the same date. Los Alamitos is dark Sunday and 
Monday; Del Mar is closed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
ITW and harness racing both require a $2.25 general admission. Arnold said ITW 
patrons would be allowed to remain for the harness program without additional 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Del Mar simulcast help, hurt or have minimal impact on Los Alamitos 
harness business? 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew the answer to that," Arnold said. "If it totally annihilated us, 
we'd have to stop it. But I don't think it will. I think it will help. A lot of 
working people don't get to ITW until late in the afternoon. We've got our post 
time (7:30, approximately one hour after the last race at Del Mar) so some of 
those people can stay." 
</P>
<P>
Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos is hoping a request for trifecta wagering will be approved at a 
California Horse Racing Board meeting Friday at Del Mar. In trifecta wagering, 
a patron attempts to select the 1-2-3 finishers in order in one race. If 
approved, the experiment would allow one race a night to be used with a full 
field of 10 to be used for the wagering format. . . . Lloyd Arnold remained 
confident of finding another Southern California site for harness racing to 
bridge the gap between Oct. 20 and the Feb. 1 reopening of Los Alamitos. . . . 
Nothing Ventured, a 4-year-old trotter in the Nicol Tremblay stable, was named 
horse of the meet at Sacramento after setting a track record of 1:57 2/5 and 
winning his last six starts. Ross Croghan led the drivers with 67 victories, 
and Tim Diliberto paced the trainers with 44. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold was overwhelmed by more than 2,500 nominations to the California Cup, a 
3-year-old pace, which will begin in 1992. A 3-year-old trotting division will 
be added in 1993. . . . Pete DeLuca and Randy Swick have been hired to promote 
harness racing at Los Alamitos' ITW outlets. . . . The Los Alamitos harness 
horsemen will play Billy Barty's Hollywood Shorties in a charity baseball game 
Sunday at 1 p.m. at Arnold Cypress Park on the corner of Walker and Crescent in 
Cypress. Donation is $3. . . .

SECOND DRAFT CHOICE MILLS TRYING TO BRIDGE THE EXPERIENCE GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Chargers' top draft selection? 
</P>
<P>
Easy. Junior Seau. 
</P>
<P>
The second guy? 
</P>
<P>
Take a few minutes to think, but don't knock yourself out. You won't find this 
guy on the front of any cereal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Jeff Mills, he played outside linebacker for Nebraska and he was 
the draft's 57th pick overall in the third round. At 6-3 1/2, 238 pounds, he is 
built perfectly for this position, and he is quick and strong. But there's one 
problem. Billy Ray Smith plays the same position. And so does Henry Rolling, a 
plan B free agent from Tampa Bay who has performed nicely in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Mills has gotten a bit of work on special teams and played a lot of 
practice downs on the scout team. That's about it. During the games he does a 
lot of observing. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that will change depends on whether he can make a few plays that catch 
the coach's eye in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to be more productive in practice to get more work in the games," 
Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "He's at a disadvantage because there are two 
guys who are there at that spot that have been playing there longer than he 
has. And he just has to make up ground." 
</P>
<P>
Can he do that in time to survive the final two cuts? 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're here for," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly a vote of confidence, but then again, confidence isn't something 
that Mills is lacking. Asked if he thinks he'll make the team, he responded: 
"Yes, I think I'll make the team. There's no reason I can't make the team. As 
far as talent goes, I've got it. If they have something else in mind, I can 
play on some other team. I'm not worried about that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, this role of watching rather than participating can get old fast. We're 
talking about a guy who made 108 total tackles in starting his junior and 
senior seasons as a Cornhusker. He's not used to standing on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to feel comfortable with what I'm doing," he said. "Up until that 
point, I can't show everybody what I really can do." 
</P>
<P>
Seau, the Charger's first-round draft selection from USC, has taken a short 
leave of absence from San Diego. Steve Feldman, his agent, says Seau is working 
out twice a day but he won't say where. 
</P>
<P>
As for contract negotiations, Feldman and Charger General Manager Bobby 
Beathard are scheduled to meet this morning. The Chargers will make what 
Beathard said may be their final offer. Because Seau has already missed a month 
of training camp, Beathard feels a sense of urgency to wrap up the negotiations 
and get Seau on the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think something's got to happen now," Beathard said. "A decision has to be 
made. I hope that (today) we can get something together that will encourage him 
to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers plan to move Seau from outside to inside linebacker, which will 
take time for him to master. Even if Seau signs this week, Beathard said he 
won't be ready for the regular season opener at Dallas on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be expecting too much," Beathard said. "You lose him for 
the first part of the season, but I don't know how long." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman says Seau's position hasn't changed; he wants a fair contract, and he 
wants to play. But Feldman said Seau has decided he will keep a low profile 
until the deal is done. 
</P>
<P>
Since defensive end Lee Williams walked out of camp for a week at the end of 
July to protest the Chargers' refusal to renegotiate his contract, the Chargers 
have renegotiated running back Marion Butts' contract and have reportedly 
agreed to do so with wide receiver Anthony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has three years remaining on a five-year contract sources say 
will pay him about $725,000 this season, said he isn't bothered by Butts' or 
Miller's new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think both those players deserve what they get," he said. "It's a totally 
different situation. I don't concern myself with the finances of other 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard reiterated the Chargers' position on Williams' contract, saying it 
would not be rewritten and that it was a completely different situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee Williams signed his contract after he had gotten to a point in his career 
where he was doing well," Beathard said. "These guys (Butts and Miller) are 
playing up here and being paid down here. It's not as if Lee's in the poor 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't satisfy everybody. Every time you (rewrite a contract) other players 
think 'Well, I deserve it too.' That's a matter of evaluation by a player. We 
have to do things by our own evaluation and not by the agent's. That's the 
system. I don't think it's fair, but that's the way it is right now." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Arthur Cox, who sustained a back injury two weeks ago, had a 
cortisone shot Tuesday. Henning said Cox has an arthritic condition and that it 
is unknown how long he will be out. He will miss Saturday's game against the 
49ers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the Chargers will consider picking up another tight end if Cox's 
injury continues to prevent him from practicing. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Gill Byrd suffered a groin strain in practice Tuesday but is not 
expected to miss any practice.

HARDESTY MOVES INTO FIRST, BUT HOUSER SLIPS IN SAILING CHAMPIONSHIPS

<P>
Bill Hardesty of San Diego's Mission Bay Yacht Club moved into first alone in 
the Flying Junior class, and David Houser of Coronado Yacht Club fell from 
first to second in the Laser class as the U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex Junior 
Sailing Championships continued at the Newport Harbor Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Hardesty began the day tied for first with Jesse Andrews of American Yacht Club 
in Rye, N.Y. but moved up with a third-place finish in the competition's third 
race and a first-place finish in the fourth. He has 6 1/2 points to 8 3/4 for 
Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Races continue through Friday, when the winners will be determined based upon 
round-robin, low-point scoring system. Winners will become part of the 1990 
U.S. Junior sailing team. 
</P>
<P>
"We had really good speed upwind and had a long upwind leg," Hardesty said. 
"And we have more experience sailing in swells and know how to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, who is sailing unfamiliar waters, said he had difficulty with the 
swells and lost boat speed as a result. Gately Ross, crew for Andrews, said 
that the duo also had too much weight for the Flying Junior class. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lasers, Houser has 11 3/4 points to 9 1/4 for the leader, Mike Hare of 
Houston Yacht Club. In three races Tuesday, Houser finished second, out of the 
top three and third. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do so well today because I couldn't always follow the wind shifts and 
I got caught going the wrong way too often," said Houser. "My best leg was 
upwind." 
</P>
<P>
Hare said the conditions were perfect for him. "It was shifty, but not so 
shifty that I couldn't predict it. I was very fast down wind, but I really did 
well by taking advantage of the mistakes of others." 
</P>
<P>
A collision and protests delayed the results of the second of Tuesday's two 
Etchells 22 class races for the Sears Cup portion of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Jory Twist of Newport Harbor Yacht Club, in third Monday, swept races three and 
four Tuesday and could move up to first overall depending upon the outcome of 
the protests. 
</P>
<P>
They involved, among others, the class's first- and second-place boats, 
skippered by Scott Elting of Houston Yacht Club and Manning Montagnet of Pass 
Christian Yacht Club in Mississippi. Four boats are affected by the protest, 
and the outcome of the ruling could have a major effect on the class' 
standings. Jonathan Mosely of St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco and Sam 
Vineyard of Beverly Yacht Club in Massachusetts collided in the fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors described sailing conditions on the course as perfect, with 
westerly winds of eight to 10 knots and flat seas.

Pitcher Atlee Hammaker, the National League starter in the 1983 All-Star game, 
has signed a contract with the Padres for the remainder of the season with a 
club option for 1991, the Padres announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also announced they had sent right-handed pitcher John Davis down to 
triple-A Las Vegas and recalled outfielder Gerald Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Hammaker, a left-hander, had been a free agent since his release Aug. 11 by San 
Francisco. The Padres were one of three or four teams after his services, said 
Jack McKeon, the Padres' vice president/baseball operations. The New York Mets, 
in town for a three-game series, and Cincinnati, the National League West 
leader, were among those also said to be interested. 
</P>
<P>
Hammaker, 59-62 lifetime with a 3.58 earned run average, was 4-5 with a 4.28 
ERA in 25 games this season. A starter early in his career, Hammaker began 
relieving at the start of 1988. He has been used in a mixed role ever since and 
started just six games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he would be used with the Padres, McKeon said, "That's up to the 
manager (Greg Riddoch)." 
</P>
<P>
Hammaker is expected to join the team Friday in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have to pay Hammaker only the league minimum salary ($100,000) this 
year (prorated through the end of the season) and next season. The Giants must 
pay the remainder of his contract, estimated to be between $800,000 and 
$900,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was out there, and we like left-handers," McKeon said. "We had nothing 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Hammaker first made it to the majors in 1981 with Kansas City. He was traded to 
the Giants the following spring and pitched well enough in the first half of 
1983 to be selected the All-Star starter. But he had injury problems in the 
second half and finished 10-9 with a league-leading 2.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
In 9 1/3 innings in six appearances, Davis was 0-1 with a 5.79 ERA. JIM

NEW AND USEFUL: NATURAL APPROACH TO FRESHENING SHOES 
</P>

<P>
Odor Zappers are new, all-natural shoe stuffers that eliminate shoe and boot 
odors. The 100% cotton bags, filled with minerals mined in Arizona, absorb 
moisture and odor buildup. 
</P>
<P>
They fit all types and sizes of shoes. Each pair can absorb more than 200 grams 
of moisture, says their manufacturer, Al Letcher of Lancaster. They also 
eliminate the need for bulky charcoal insoles. 
</P>
<P>
"You can leave them in your shoes whenever you're not wearing them," says 
Letcher. "And you can regenerate the bags by hanging them outside on the 
clothesline in the sun for a couple of days or putting them in the oven (at 200 
degrees Fahrenheit) for a couple of hours." Since the mineral that fills the 
bags is natural -- it is from the zeolite family -- there's nothing harmful to 
people or pets. 
</P>
<P>
Odor Zappers are available nationwide for a suggested retail price of $3.99 in 
selected shoe repair shops, sporting goods stores and specialty stores. In 
Southern California, you can find them in all Nike retail outlets; Pic 'N Save 
stores; Chick's Sporting Goods in Covina, Upland, Laguna Hills, Yorba Linda and 
Oceanside; Anthony's Shoe Repair in Newport Beach, Corona Del Mar, Santa Ana 
and Costa Mesa; Windham's in Redondo Beach; Vincent's Shoe Repair in Fullerton; 
Universal Shoe Repair in Newhall; Everett's Shoes &amp; Repair in Claremont; 
Joe Panza Shoe Repair in La Habra; Rossmoor USA Shoe Repair in Fountain Valley, 
and Guarantee Shoe Center in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't find Odor Zappers in your area, for the nearest location, contact 
Letcher &amp; Associates, P.O. Box 107, Lancaster, Calif. 93534; (805) 
942-0428.

Colorful Straws for Brand-Loyal Sippers 
</P>
<P>
Sip Top is a new vented straw-like device that fits most standard water, cola 
and seltzer containers, so you can drink your beverage of choice right out of 
the bottle, instead of transfering it to one of those plastic sports bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that brand-loyal consumers want to be seen with their brand," 
said Randy Hanson, president of Sip Top Marketing Inc. in Culver City. "Sip Top 
affords them that, and it has the additional feature of a vent that seals 
airtight to retain carbonation and freshness and prevents leakage if tipped 
over." 
</P>
<P>
The capped straw fits most small, medium and large standard-neck bottles and 
comes in various colors, including neons. Sip Top is being introduced 
nationally in convenience stores, health food shops, discount and drug stores, 
and health and sports clubs. Its suggested retail is $1. In the Los Angeles 
area, it is available at many 7-Elevens and am/pm mini-markets. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't find Sip Tops in your area, contact Sip Top Marketing, 8780 
National Blvd., Suite 222, Culver City, Calif. 90232; (213) 838-9874.

A Hip Way to Hike With the Children 
</P>
<P>
Hip Hiker can be a big help to parents who may want to take a child where 
strollers are not permitted. Good for infants to toddlers, it's a cotton 
carrier that fits over the shoulder and slips through a ring near the waist, so 
the baby's weight is distributed across the parent's back and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
It comes in solid colors -- navy, red or gray -- with a print lining and is 
machine washable. Rosie Puff, the Santa Barbara woman who developed the 
carriers, says she got the idea from watching mothers in Indonesia carry their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
To order Hip Hiker, write to On the Go, P.O. Box 2352, Santa Barbara, Calif., 
93120; (805) 965-1408. It costs $25, plus $3 shipping and handling.

ACTOR FINDS ARTISTIC HOME IN S.D.

<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as he can remember, Jon Matthews has been searching for an artistic 
home. 
</P>
<P>
His hunt led the Brooklyn-born actor to Manhattan casting calls and his first 
Broadway play, "Runaways" when he was just 16. It was a mind-blowing and 
career-creating opportunity for the Horace Mann High School senior, but 
Broadway -- as it turned out -- wasn't quite what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of "Runaways," he was offered movie and television roles in 
Hollywood, but they weren't quite what he wanted, either. He shut his ears to 
the agents and managers and producers who flew him out to Los Angeles and told 
him he would be a fool not to follow up on the momentum of "Runaways." Instead 
he went to Harvard to find an artistic community. 
</P>
<P>
But even Harvard wasn't quite what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Now 26, he lives and acts in Hollywood, right under the Hollywood Hills sign, 
and commutes to the city that has become the spiritual escape he had been 
looking for over the past decade: San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews is about to star in "Loot," his third role at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater that they're trying to create at the San Diego Rep is a theater I 
would love to be a part of," said Matthews over breakfast at Pepper's, a 
restaurant near the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a lot of mistakes, but their heart and their spirit is in the right 
place. Any theater that looks forward to doing a Mac Wellman piece (last 
season's 'Albanian Softshoe') and 'Slingshot' knowing that their core audiences 
will be intimidated and angry deserves to be supported." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' first starring role at the Rep was "Slingshot," the theater's 
contribution to the Soviet Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
It came about indirectly because of the Rep's production of "Red Noses." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews didn't see "Red Noses," but he read the rave review about it in The 
Times and decided he wanted to work at the Rep. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would like to be part of a company that did work like that. I told 
my agents to watch out for anything that happened at the Rep. When 'The 
Marriage of Bette 
</P>
<P>
and Boo' came along, we couldn't make that work. But then they called me for 
'Slingshot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sam Woodhouse, the producing director and Douglas Jacobs, the artistic director 
of the theater, were so pleased with Matthew's work as the sexually confused 
Soviet adolescent, that they called him back for back-to-back productions of 
"Burn This" and "Loot," which opens tonight at the Lyceum Stage. 
</P>
<P>
In "Loot," a farce by Joe Orton, Matthews plays Hal, a thieving scamp who uses 
his mother's corpse to hide some loot he has stolen from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Though "Loot" is nearly a quarter of a century old, Matthews expects it to seem 
outrageous to its audiences -- and that's one of the things he likes about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We get this corpse into compromising positions. The heroes are murderers and 
thieves. There are bisexual characters on stage, and it makes fun of religion." 
</P>
<P>
It's not shock for shock's sake that appeals to him, however. 
</P>
<P>
It is shock for the sake of changing the ways people in the audience think of 
themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a concept that has been with him ever since he did "Runaways," the 
Elizabeth Swados musical about runaway teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
In "Runaways," which was produced by Joseph Papp, he said he was told the show 
was dealing with issues that are not usually discussed and was meant to be 
angry and confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that, if people didn't walk out, we were doing something wrong," 
he said. "Remembering that helped me with 'Slingshot.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Runaways" also affected Matthews' own mother who, after seeing the show, 
learned about parts of her past that she had blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"It changed her life," Matthews said quietly. "It is the paradigm that all my 
other work is measured against." 
</P>
<P>
Stunning an audience is an effect that he finds more achievable in San Diego 
than in New York, where the people are more jaded, or in Los Angeles, where he 
said people tend to look at plays as audition platforms. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, even when you get standing ovations, the audience wasn't there 
to see the play, they were there to scout talent." 
</P>
<P>
In "Slingshot," in contrast, he describes the curtain call reverentially. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like seeing the headlamps on a stunned animal. It had the incredibly 
high soul value of putting the audience in touch with their feelings. It was a 
gift." 
</P>
<P>
It is just coincidence that the three roles he has played in San Diego have 
been sexually confused, gay or sexually ambivalent characters, he said. The one 
stipulation he had on the parts he played this year was to break away from the 
adolescent parts he had played since "Runaways." 
</P>
<P>
These are actually the first non-straight parts this straight actor has had. 
</P>
<P>
He likes the parts and the fact that he is being cast in adult roles, not only 
here but in Tony Kushner's "Millennium Approaches" at the Taper Too in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He has other ambitions as well: On the Mondays he has off from "Loot," Matthews 
will be exploring yet another role -- he will direct three one-act plays by 
Margo Kessler for a new theater group he founded in Los Angeles called Acme 
Theatrics. The show, "Hormonal Disturbances," will star film actors DeDee 
Pfeiffer and Keanu Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' previous roles include a milk-spewing geek in "Heathers," roles in 
"China Beach," "L.A. Law," John Guare's "Landscape of the Body" Off-Broadway, 
and "Romance Language" at Playwrights Horizons in New York and at the Mark 
Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Still, because of his roles at the San Diego Rep, the slight-looking actor 
joked that he may insist on a macho role next time he comes to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If I come back, I guess I'll need to play Stanley Kowalski." 
</P>
<P>
But what he really wants is a challenge, preferably a controversial one. He 
wants a role that tests his limits rather than allows him to repeat a 
performance he has already given, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wonderful thing about being in a community where they see you do a lot of 
different parts is that they can be amazed by the different people one person 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's incredibly important that we realize we have endless 
possibilities within ourselves. What's great about acting, if you do it right, 
is that you constantly expand who you are. 
</P>
<P>
"If the audience believes in that character I construct, then I hope they will 
understand that they can do the same, that they can be other people. When they 
see me constantly change my life, then maybe they can see that they can change 
their lives."

A FIELD OF DREAMS FROM SMITHSONIAN

<P>
The summer that the boy was a skinny 9-year-old, his cousin George -- an 
awesomely seasoned sandlot pitcher of 11 -- dragooned the klutzy kid onto the 
diamond. The kid promptly broke a bat, stubbed his thumb on a pop fly and fell 
asleep in the outfield, covered with chalk dust. To George's disgust, the kid 
threw in the towel. Feeling wimpy and alienated, the boy has skulked about for 
the rest of his life pretending the national pastime does not exist. Thus, when 
an exhibition of art about baseball turned up scheduled at the San Diego Museum 
of Contemporary Art, the thoughts it triggered in him were aesthetic, not 
sportive. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? A seaside sanctuary normally devoted to purist 
avant-garde art hosts a Smithsonian traveling show called "Diamonds Are 
Forever" (until Oct. 21). The show includes fine art by people as well known as 
Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Lewis Hine. There are quotations from famous 
authors such as Jacques Barzun and Neil Simon, not to mention a vitrine full of 
Babe Ruth memorabilia and a large-screen TV showing such classics as Abbott and 
Costello's "Who's on First?" routine. 
</P>
<P>
Well, everybody knows museums are under pressure to popularize themselves these 
days. Trustees want to draw big crowds to help defray ever-escalating costs. 
Healthy attendance encourages benefactors and eases the getting of grants. 
Besides, it makes the board feel popular and successful to have a museum full 
of happy viewers who enjoy the art, rather than an empty museum haunted by 
weird artniks and citizens who complain they don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, museums have shown great deftness in concocting exhibitions that 
successfully walk the line between popularity and respectability. Real 
disasters, such as the time the San Diego Museum of Art showed the Muppets, are 
rare. All the same, "Diamonds Are Forever" ignited suspicions of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, it's a delightful show. Only a crank with a tissue-thin 
epidermis would be offended by it. Even somebody who consciously ignores 
baseball is touched and illuminated by the affection it has inspired in artists 
and photographers, comedians and writers. Baseball isn't just about itself, 
it's about America's most cherished images of itself. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was founded to be a rational Eden. The mental image that 
conjures up looks very much like a baseball stadium, all neatly divided into 
bleachers for the fans, field and dugouts for the players. Ballparks depicted 
by artists such as Jim Dow show fields green as pastoral emeralds. The point of 
the game, as a wiser man observed, is to get to home. Back home to the wife and 
kiddies, cozy and safe. French artist Raoul Dufy got the idyllic, playful feel 
of the grounds down just right. It's too bad Georges Seurat never did a 
baseball picture. The game's gentler poetry would harmonize well with 
pointillism. 
</P>
<P>
Americans like to think of themselves as competing fair and square, according 
to the rules and without violence. The layout of the baseball field is clear 
and rational. Rival pitcher and batter face each other squarely as individuals 
who will duel not with saber and six-shooter but with bat and ball. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial team spirit operates more indirectly on the field with every player 
and runner in his position. It looks simple, but the subtleties of play, I'm 
told, are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Artschwager looks at a game from the point of view of a high fly, 
dwarfing players. Tina Chaden puns in a model stadium titled "The Baseball 
Fan," where the infield is made of a lady's fan. 
</P>
<P>
Americans like to think they are straight-ahead folks whose prefered style is 
simplicity. Baseball uniforms have the functional naivete of 
turn-of-the-century boy's outfits with their caps and knickers. Artists like 
Gerald Garston and Robert Gwathmey see players in an ice cream colored folk-art 
style. Edward Larson made a weather-vane whirligig called "Ronald Reagan 
Strikes Out on Foreign Policy." Baseball blends well with pop style and with 
the kind of populist realism practiced by Harvey Dinnerstein. Lance Richbourg 
renders a slide into second base with the metaphysical stillness of a Morandi. 
It all makes you wonder if there aren't baseball pictures by Eakins and Hopper 
around somewhere. If there are, they aren't here. 
</P>
<P>
That's all fine, but what does baseball have to do with art, really? Actually 
quite a lot. They share qualities of subdued competition, myth-making and 
hero-worship. Both need lots of style and graceful execution that cannot be too 
obvious lest they appear artificial. Among the nicest pieces here are a pair of 
bronzes by John Dreyfuss that share some of the manner of Elie Nadelman's blend 
of folk plainness and Cocktail Moderne chic. Dreyfuss depicts a pitcher at that 
moment of casual otherworldly contemplation just before the windup. He stands 
alone as sleek as Brancusi's "Bird in Flight" on a pedestal facing a praying 
mantis catcher across the way. The empty space between is ethereal. Only the 
relationship counts. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition never goes sour, but it does get a little edgy when it gets too 
cute or too serious about itself. When James Sullivan draws a hardball atop a 
classical column and Harvey Breverman puts one in the hand of Michelangelo's 
God as he reaches for Adam's finger, it's clear if obvious fun. When Jim 
Markowich presents a model cathedral whose stained glass depicts baseball 
scenes, you just shrug and walk away looking for something more fibrous to chew 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fischl tries for it in "Boys at Bat," which shows a shy kid in uniform 
uneasily watching his nude father bat one in the back yard. It's heavy-handed 
Freudianism, and desire to shock is not worthy of the nuances of either sport 
or art. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the wry gentleness of things that are more telling, like William King's 
shiny red vinyl sculptural fantasy, "Self as Doubleday," or Scott Mlyn's photo 
of fans ogling a New York Yankee hero. A young guy is as healthily worshipful 
as the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamonds Are Forever" might be accused of trying to perpetuate a myth in a 
real world where baseball has become big corporate business and scandals erupt 
around heroes like Pete Rose. Much the same thing has happened to art in a 
lobotomized bottom-line world seemingly determined to reduce everything to the 
same dreary commercial sludge. Well, recently George Steinbrenner was forced to 
give up ownership of the Yankees, which I'm told was a victory for the good 
guys. When a Van Gogh goes for $50 million at auction, the painting rises above 
the fray and remains itself. Some human activities inspire irrepressible 
idealization, thank goodness.

MALLE'S 'MAY FOOLS' FAR FROM HIS BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A film by Louis Malle is generally an occasion for celebration. "May Fools" (at 
the Port Theatre in Corona del Mar) is not exactly an exception, it's simply 
way down the list of that urbane director's best efforts. It's not, heaven help 
us, "Black Moon," or "Crackers," but it can't even rub shoulders with "Murmur 
of the Heart" or "Lacombe Lucien" or "Au Revoir Les Enfants." 
</P>
<P>
Malle's best films cast a warm if ironic eye on the foibles of his fellow man. 
In "May Fools," co-written with Jean-Claude Carriere, the director seems 
remote, his characters thin to the point of caricature. 
</P>
<P>
These comfortable landowners are walking the countryside of Jean Renoir, there 
is even a literal link to that director's films in the casting of 82-year-old 
Paulette Dubost as the matriarch of the family -- she was the maid in Renoir's 
1939 classic "Rules of the Game." And in a love of family and place, there is a 
suggestion of Tavernier's bucolic masterpiece, "A Sunday in the Country." Yet 
"May Fools" is not lyrical filmmaking, it's oddly abrupt and unsubtle, even 
with music by Stephane Grappelli to nudge and bridge his story along. 
</P>
<P>
It's the May of the French student revolutions, 1968, as militant students 
supported by striking workers nationwide have brought France to a standstill, 
threatening to overturn De Gaulle's government with their demands for social 
reform. As one young man just back from Paris describes it, the fire of 
revolution in his voice, "People are holding hands, they're talking; they meet 
and make love right away." 
</P>
<P>
The film takes place in the rich French wine country, where the Vieuzac family 
has had its rambling villa for generations. Paris seems remote. News of its 
street fighting comes in spurts from an unreliable radio or via equally 
unreliable rumors from the nearby village. In any case Milou (Michel Piccoli) 
who's managed the family vineyard for decades, has more urgent matters to 
consider; his mother (Dubost), matriarch of the family, has just died. Quickly 
summoned, the family members stream to the country for the funeral and, more 
importantly to each of them, the reading of Mme. Vieuzac's will. 
</P>
<P>
Malle is a little cavalier about the relationships; halfway through the film, 
we may still be untangling them. In any case, Mme. Vieuzac's children include 
Piccoli's Milou, a widower who has lived on the estate most of his life; 
Camille (Miou-Miou), his materialistic married daughter, a summation of 
everything small-minded and mean about the bourgeoisie; Georges (Michel 
Duchaussoy), Milou's slightly younger brother, a correspondent for Le Monde who 
sprinkles his speech with little English expressions; Lily, (Harriet Walter) 
Georges' English actress-wife and Claire (Dominique Blanc), Mme. Vieuzac's 
orphaned granddaughter who arrives for the services with her fetching young 
lover, ballet student Marie-Laure (Rozenn Le Tallec). 
</P>
<P>
Others include Adele (Martine Gautier), Mme. Vieuzac's devoted young 
housekeeper and, bearing bruises from Paris street fighting, Georges' son, 
Pierre-Alain (Renaud Danner), and the friendly macho trucker, Grimaldi (Bruno 
Carette), who although hardly a revolutionary himself, has picked up the young 
man and delivered him to his doorstep. So, amid meals of crayfish and wine, 
family reminiscences, tensions, bickering and flirtations, the formalities 
attending the end of a life unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Best among the actors are Blanc, who looks as though she could play Edith Piaf, 
big-eyed and tormented; Miou-Miou, biting in her thankless role and Piccoli as 
the only family member to weep for his mother. He's also splendid in his 
exchanges with Camille's inquisitive pre-teen-age daughter Francoise 
(engagingly played by Miou-Miou's own daughter, Jeanne Herry-Leclerc), unfazed 
by her questions as to why Claire ties Marie-Laure to the bedpost at night, or 
what all this talk about "the pill" means. 
</P>
<P>
The film's criss-crossing alliances are conventional; the tryst in the hayloft, 
the pinch in the hall, the slap-and-tickle in the wine cellar. (Its R rating is 
for brief nudity.) What Renoir investigates with rueful wisdom and what Chekhov 
-- in the films of Nikita Mikhalkov -- has displayed with infinite subtlety, 
Malle does here with neither urgency nor particular freshness. 
</P>
<P>
Malle, superb at puncturing the rich right during the political upheaval of the 
1950s in "Murmur of the Heart" is reduced to creating a midnight trek by all 
concerned to avoid being massacred in their beds by revolutionary mobs. Silly 
and arbitrary, it's an exhausted excuse for closure. Better is the final 
farewell of son and mother, gently sentimental but at least in keeping with the 
tone of the rest of "May Fools."

No Interview for Oprah: The Oprah Winfrey show on Monday boasted of a coup. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Long, the Atlanta woman who reportedly had a two-year affair and marriage 
to former Archbishop Eugene Marino, and her attorney Gloria Allred had granted 
an exclusive interview to Oprah. The interview was to be taped Wednesday and 
was to air Thursday. But on Tuesday, word went out that the interview was 
canceled. " 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' has made the decision that it would be 
inappropriate to conduct the interview at this time," said a release. A 
spokeswoman for the show would not disclose the story behind the cancellation, 
but said, "We feel that statement speaks for itself." BETH KLEID

ENOUGH WITH THE GADGETS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANS PASSED ON THE VIDEO TELEPHONE. IT SEEMS WARY CONSUMERS WANT UTILITY 
AND NOT JUST BELLS AND WHISTLES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Jetson has one; it's been standard equipment on his cartoon planet for 
nearly 30 years. But can you get a picture telephone in your house today? No 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, though, you could. Then, Sony, Mitsubishi and Panasonic were 
all selling pioneering video phone models that quickly captured the imagination 
of futurists, trend-seeking market analysts and headline writers. Unfortunately 
for the manufacturers, only a relatively few gadget-happy shoppers followed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the hype and hoopla subsided, the products were quietly pulled 
off the market. Sony, confides one insider, doesn't like to admit the product 
even existed. Mitsubishi peddled the last of its models, priced originally at 
$3,300 a pair, over the Home Shopping Network for a mere $500 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sexy product that people everywhere stopped to look at. But they just 
didn't buy it," shrugs Ric Fochtman, executive vice president for Mitsubishi 
Electronics America Inc. in Cypress. "It just wasn't the product they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way in the home automation and appliance business for a while. 
Despite the promises and advanced visions -- many of them aimed at replicating 
the animated home of Jane and George Jetson -- progress had been riddled with 
misguided efforts, laggard development and, most importantly, unexpectedly slow 
and wary consumer acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot? With few exceptions -- notably the microwave oven and a handful of 
minimally computerized appliances -- the state of home automation today is not 
much more advanced than it was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
And the outlook isn't much more encouraging. Although there are promising 
developments on the horizon, home builders, appliance manufacturers and utility 
service suppliers so far have been stymied in their efforts to bring the latest 
computer-style electronics and communications to the everyday operation of the 
average American home. 
</P>
<P>
Their ultimate goal is not a house like the Jetsons', packed with such far-out 
gizmos as a meal-dispensing "food-a-rack-a-cycle" and a seeing-eye vacuum 
cleaner. Instead, they're after a home with a far more mundane ability: taking 
care of itself and sparing its owner needless operational and repair expense. 
</P>
<P>
In this vision, self-diagnosing appliances and utility systems would not only 
recognize any operating problems, but report them, via ordinary telephone 
lines, to maintenance and repair crews. Landscaping irrigation systems would 
come with built-in weather sensors to improve water conservation. Indoor 
heating and air conditioning could be controlled and monitored to reduce waste 
and minimize costs. And appliances could be programmed to operate during hours 
of off-peak utility rates. 
</P>
<P>
These concepts are more than the dreams of overly imaginative engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, prototypes of such homes -- called "Smart Houses" -- are being built 
nationwide under the auspices of the National Assn. of Homebuilders, including 
one by Southern California Edison in Covina. However, these initial efforts, 
scheduled for unveiling in April, 1991, are aimed only at new home 
construction, a slim sliver of the entire housing market. Products for the 
nation's huge market of perhaps 80 million existing homes are not expected for 
years, delayed while the home remodeling and appliance industries select the 
best and easiest way to accomplish the retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, analysts say, home automation will limp along as it has, offering 
fancy security systems, programmable thermostats and a smattering of 
computer-driven utility and security management devices. Sales of these devices 
-- which range in cost from several hundred dollars for the simplest to tens of 
thousands of dollars for the most upscale -- should exceed $900 million this 
year, and $2.2 billion by 1995, a far cry from their full potential, says 
Trisha Parks, a home automation market researcher in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
There is ample historical precedent for the slow acceptance of new technology 
into the American home. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the dishwasher. Although introduced in 1886, sales some 45 years later 
were limping along at the rate of about 7,500 a year. Even the microwave oven, 
perhaps today's top-selling appliance, took years to find its place in the 
kitchen after its accidental discovery in 1946. (According to the lore, the 
cooking power of microwave energy was discovered by a researcher who noticed 
that a chocolate bar in his shirt pocket melted while he was experimenting with 
high-frequency radar waves.) 
</P>
<P>
Some say the lack of technology isn't the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the technology is generally available to give us the house that we 
all want, the house that can take care of itself and diagnose its problems," 
Parks said. "The primary barrier is cost. Consumers aren't willing to spend 
money on technology, just for the sake of it. They want to know that whatever 
technology they are buying will save them either time or money. Cost is the 
major issue." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also may be intimidated by sophisticated gadgetry. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers aren't against technology, but they won't buy it if it's too 
complicated. That's why people still use their microwaves only to defrost and 
the videocassette recorders only to play prerecorded tapes," says Thomas Riley, 
president of Unity Systems, manufacturer of a computerized utility and security 
control system for the home. "The devices can do far more, but the consumer 
doesn't attempt it because it's too much bother." 
</P>
<P>
Others blame the slow acceptance on the lack of a uniform development standard. 
Without widely accepted manufacturing and communication protocols for the 
electrical appliances, security systems and other household items, linking them 
to each other and to telephone systems is a daunting task. So rather than 
plunge into uncharted territory, many manufacturers have generally stayed on 
the sidelines, waiting for the completion of the Smart Houses project, which 
will produce a set of standards for linking appliances. 
</P>
<P>
But could another factor be male chauvinism? Ruth Schwartz Cowan, who teaches 
the history of technology at State University of New York in Stoney Brook, 
doesn't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
"The kinds of things women would like in their homes are not the kind of things 
male engineers are interested in developing," she argues. "Just look at robots. 
Engineers love them, but most things a robot can do wouldn't be critical time 
savers in the home. In fact, the most time-consuming tasks in the home -- food 
preparation and clean-up -- can't be done by a robot." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the marketing team at Mitsubishi had no idea that its 
Lumaphone, unveiled in 1987, would meet its ignominious fate on the Home 
Shopping Network just two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reviews of the video phone were smashing. It was the star attraction of 
a couple of trade shows. And consumers seemed intrigued by the technology. 
</P>
<P>
Then reality set in. Consumers were disappointed in what the system actually 
offered. It projected only static black-and-white photos, about 3 inches 
square. Only one picture at a time could be transmitted across a telephone 
line, and during the two or three minutes it took to send the picture, no 
conversation was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the sticker shock. The units were priced at $1,599 each, and 
consumers quickly learned that the system was useless unless purchased in pairs 
because the person on the other line needed one too. "At those prices people 
said they would rather wait until the phone offered full motion video and 
color," recalls Fochtman. 
</P>
<P>
"George Jetson's phone, that really is the future. And we learned that 
consumers have that same vision too," he adds. "Only they're not willing to buy 
the intermediate product." 
</P>
<P>
The Lumaphone wasn't Mitsubishi's only failure during 1987. At the same time 
the phone was introduced, a team of advanced engineers rolled out the company's 
deluxe home management system, a computer-like device that could control the 
lights, temperature, security alarms, intercom and piped-in music in every room 
of the house. The only problem with the system, recalls one company insider, is 
that it practically required a Ph.D. in engineering to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which never made it into production, was sent back to the research 
labs in Japan for further work, and has not been heard of since. Company 
officials decline to reveal how much the company spent developing the 
prototype. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi is far from alone at misjudging the consumer's appetite for 
household wizardry. In the early 1980s, Sharp Electronics introduced a 
microwave oven in the United States that came equipped with 30 electronically 
encoded recipe cards. The idea was to pop the food into the oven, run the 
recipe card through the "reader" as you would run a debit card through a bank 
automated teller machine, and walk away. Dinner was ready when the beeper 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, which cost about $100 more than comparable models, was pulled off 
the market when customers balked at the price tag. Sharp officials say the 
lesson they learned from the recipe card fiasco has kept them from introducing 
a couple of kitchen items that have proven popular in Japan, including a $1,000 
microwave oven that comes with its own bar-code scanning wand and bar-code 
labeled cookbook, whose purpose is similar to that of the original model with 
the recipe cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared with their Japanese counterparts, U.S. consumers are not all that 
gadget-happy," says Ann Howard, Sharp's national marketing manager in Mahwah, 
N.J. "The U.S. consumer is more interested in products with good value, not 
necessarily all the latest bells and whistles."

IRAQI MISSILES IN KUWAIT RAISE CHEMICAL FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq has moved into Kuwait an unknown number of surface-to-surface missiles 
that are believed capable of delivering chemical warheads, a senior Saudi 
military official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Turki ibn Nasser, commander of a Saudi military base, said the missiles, 
which have a range of about 300 miles, began arriving in Kuwait the week after 
Iraq invaded the tiny Persian Gulf emirate Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Other Saudi and U.S. military officials said the missiles are believed to be 
either Soviet-made Scud or a similar, longer-range version of the Scud known as 
the Hussein. In either case, targets in Saudi Arabia would be within range, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are capable of delivering high explosives," Prince Turki told reporters. 
"There is talk of them being capable of carrying chemical warfare weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi military officials said pilots on both sides of the 
Saudi-Kuwaiti border have been engaged in almost daily "cat-and-mouse" border 
sorties, edging up to within 30 miles of the border before withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always this cat-and-mouse-type thing on the border," the prince said. 
"We see them, we lock on (with radar) and they turn and go. I think they're 
afraid of the capabilities of our aircraft. . . . With the capabilities of the 
aircraft we fly, we don't need to be really close." 
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi officials are confident that the forces assembled in the Saudi 
desert over the last two weeks, vulnerable at first because of their small 
numbers, are now capable of halting an Iraqi assault on Saudi Arabia and of 
"kicking them back up north." 
</P>
<P>
But he expressed doubt that the Saudi, U.S. and other troops that make up the 
multinational force have the capability of carrying out a surgical strike in 
Iraq to help free the foreigners detained there. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, I don't think anybody knows where they are," the prince said. "You 
have to have an exact location to do that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
With Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deployment of the missiles in Kuwait, he 
said, "I think he has the ability and he has the means of delivering chemical 
weapons. . . . You expect anything from this guy." 
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi officials have not been able to determine the precise number of 
missiles deployed in Kuwait, but another officer, who asked not to be 
identified, said in an interview that their information is nearly exact. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good understanding of their locations and their numbers, and we keep 
an eye on them," he said. "We are confident we can deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
In London, the publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly said Iraq had moved 36 Scud 
launchers into Kuwait over the weekend, and some military experts estimated the 
number of missiles already in Kuwait at up to 800. 
</P>
<P>
Heino Kopietz, a London-based Middle East military specialist, also said it 
appears likely that Iraq has deployed Scud missiles in Kuwait. He said he would 
not be surprised if Iraq were to deploy a weapon it used frequently in its 
eight-year war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes absolute sense," he said. "It shows they are strengthening their 
forward defense and they are willing to retaliate." 
</P>
<P>
The Scud is also deployed by Soviet forces in Eastern Europe. Military experts 
say it can be useful against large-area targets but is not very precise and 
would not be effective against small targets. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Turki said he believes that the Saudi and U.S. forces would be able to 
counter the Scud with the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which is 
capable of intercepting missiles as well as aircraft. The Patriot has not been 
tested against the Scud, he said, but "it's quite good in theory and tests." 
</P>
<P>
Recent Saudi intelligence reports show that the Iraqis have deployed tanks and 
surface-to-air missiles near the Saudi-Kuwaiti border at Khafji and are massing 
troops and equipment along Kuwaiti beaches as if expecting a landing there. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are uncertain where Iraq will put a large number of troops being 
pulled back from its border with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now rearranging his Iraqi front, but we really don't know what he's going 
to do with those forces," Prince Turki said. "Is he going to take them north or 
south? We really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Young Saudi men were reported lining up Monday at recruiting stations in 
response to King Fahd's appeal Sunday for volunteers to "defend the nation and 
protect its Islamic shrine from any aggression." The king ordered the opening 
of recruiting and training centers throughout the kingdom. The Saudi army's 
present strength is 84,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab world's first astronaut, Lt. Col. Sultan ibn Salman, an F-15 fighter 
pilot in the Saudi air force, said in an interview Sunday that the Saudi air 
force would dominate the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no question in my mind that we are absolutely guaranteed to win," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But most pilots hope it won't come to war, he said, adding, "I would hope first 
of all that no shooting war would break out, because the whole thing is crazy, 
and it's escalated to a point that's unbelievable."

1ST MAGELLAN PHOTOS REVEAL VENUS HAD A VIOLENT PAST; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: NASA SCIENTISTS ARE SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF FAULTS AND THE STRENGTH 
OF EARLIER VOLCANIC ACTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Magellan spacecraft has sent back its first snapshots of Venus, revealing a 
planet ripped and shredded by powerful stresses that appear far more pervasive 
than the tectonic forces that generate great earthquakes and catastrophic 
volcanoes on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The radar camera aboard the spacecraft, which pierces the layers of dense 
clouds that normally hide the surface of Venus, snapped a series of long, 
narrow images of the planet. Everywhere the camera looked it found giant faults 
and evidence of past volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The first images are part of a "test strip" used to check out the spacecraft's 
radar system. They will be followed in the coming months with extensive 
coverage of the planet that is most like the Earth in size and distance from 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Venus' geological history appears "more violent than I had imagined before," 
project scientist Stephen Saunders said Tuesday during a press conference at 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
during which the first photos were released. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the images were captured, the spacecraft mysteriously lost 
contact with Earth and went into a "safe mode" designed to help reestablish 
communications. The malfunction left scientists at the Pasadena lab wondering 
for a while if the show was already over. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only hours after NASA released the first pictures of Venus, JPL 
engineers again lost contact with Magellan. "They lost it at 7:03 p.m. PDT" 
while tracking Magellan with a NASA Deep Space Network antenna dish near 
Canberra, Australia, said spokesman Jim Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
They were uncertain whether the spacecraft was going into an automatic 
self-protection routine in which it would send a radio beam across the sky in 
an attempt to re-establish communications with Earth, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
If the spacecraft was beaming radio waves while spinning, as it is supposed to 
do in an emergency, engineers expected to be able to re-establish intermittent 
contact early today. 
</P>
<P>
After losing contact the first time, engineers at the lab established 
communications late Friday, after a 14-hour blackout, but no one is certain 
what caused the problem. The leading theory, according to engineer John 
Slonski, is that the craft was hit by a cosmic ray or a high-energy particle 
that confused its computer. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Slonski said all systems aboard the craft appear "healthy," 
and Magellan is set to begin its scientific exploration of nearly the entire 
surface of Venus early next month. 
</P>

The craft's radar system will continually scan a narrow band on the planet's 
surface, about 12 miles wide, as Magellan orbits between 180 and 1,200 miles 
above ground. The snapshots released Tuesday covered several short stretches, 
ranging from 50 to 90 miles long, captured during 1 1/2 orbits of the 
blisteringly hot planet, which has a surface temperature of 900 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, a planetary geologist, found many features in the images that 
reminded him of places on Earth, ranging from the Rocky Mountains to the 
volcanoes of Hawaii, but he said he had not expected to find so much faulting. 
</P>
<P>
"I am somewhat surprised at the degree of fracturing (from quake-like 
activity)," Saunders said. "We found it every place we looked." 
</P>
<P>
Saunders said the evidence suggests that Venus differs from the Earth in that 
"Venus quakes" appear to have happened over wide regions, rather than being 
concentrated along the boundaries of giant tectonic plates. On Earth, most 
seismic activity is generated in areas where at least two plates grind against 
each other -- the process that created the San Andreas Fault in California. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders cautioned that Magellan's first glimpse may be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, just by happenstance, we started out by looking at one of the most 
active regions on Venus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tantalizing and all-too-brief look for scientists who have waited for 
years for Magellan to perform. The thousands of images it is programmed to send 
back over the next two years are expected to be 10 times sharper than radar 
images returned by two Soviet spacecraft in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The photos released Tuesday were "just a crack in the door," Saunders said. 
"I'm looking down through a narrow slit, and we are seeing things we've never 
seen before." 
</P>
<P>
The images were taken as the spacecraft zipped over a major volcanic area 
called Beta Regio. Saunders said its structure probably resembles the southern 
San Andreas Fault near the Salton Sea that is hidden several miles under the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
More "slits" will be scanned over the coming weeks and wedded together into a 
mosaic of the surface of Venus. Scientists hope to be able to draw firm 
conclusions on the geological history and current nature of the planet.

FBI AGENT LINKS EVENT FOR BROWN TO SUPPORT OF BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION TRIAL: HE HAD TO GO TO FUND-RAISER TO ASSURE 'ASSISTANCE' WITH 
LEGISLATION, OFFICIAL TELLS CARPENTER JURY. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER DENIES ANY

<TEXT>
<P>
An undercover FBI agent testified Tuesday that his efforts to get legislation 
introduced in the state Assembly suddenly met with a favorable response after 
he attended a 1986 fund-raiser for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Agent John E. Brennan, testifying in the corruption trial of former Sen. Paul 
Carpenter, said he understood that attending the Democratic Speaker's 
fund-raising event in San Francisco was "a condition of assistance" in 
introducing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Brennan was posing as an Alabama businessman seeking to introduce 
a bill that would help his shrimp business get a tax break. Shortly after the 
fund-raiser, Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) agreed to let the agent take over 
a bill the assemblyman had introduced on a different subject, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the state Capitol, both Brown and Farr denied any connection between the 
fund-raising event and the bill, which eventually was taken over by 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"I never met the man," Brown said through a spokesman. "I've never even spoken 
to the man. There is absolutely no connection and he knows there is no 
connection." 
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely no causal connection between any kind of fund-raiser 
discussion" and the bill, Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's testimony came during his fourth day on the witness stand in 
Carpenter's trial. The Norwalk Democrat, elected in 1986 to the State Board of 
Equalization, is charged with four counts of racketeering, extortion and 
conspiracy to commit extortion as a result of the FBI sting investigation of 
corruption in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
During one tape-recorded conversation that was played to the jury, Brennan said 
to Carpenter that he had attended Brown's lavish fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told I had to go to that," the agent told Carpenter. "The next week a 
bill was found that I could use, so it worked out very well." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear from the tape who advised Brennan to attend Brown's event. 
During his testimony, the veteran agent suggested that the advice came from 
Darryl O. Freeman, saying he gave the former Assembly aide cash to help promote 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Brown nor Farr has been named as a subject of the FBI investigation. 
Federal sources say that Freeman remains a target of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan spent much of the day under cross-examination explaining sections of 22 
tape-recorded conversations involving undercover operatives, Carpenter and John 
Shahabian, a former aide to the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Gerard J. Hinckley sought to undermine evidence that Carpenter 
had agreed to help win passage of the dummy FBI bill in exchange for a total of 
$20,000 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the tapes show, Carpenter suggested he would help the bill along 
by making sure that Sen. Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba), a critic of the bill, was 
absent when the measure came up in the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee 
she chairs. Vuich was absent and the measure passed her committee by a vote of 
6 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley, replaying a key portion of the tape to the jury, pointed out that 
Carpenter, Brennan and others in the room laughed when Carpenter said he would 
make sure Vuich was absent. Vuich, the attorney noted, missed the hearing 
because she was attending an Assembly committee hearing on one of her own 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
During the questioning of Brennan, the defense was largely ineffective in 
shaking the evidence presented in hours of prosecution tapes. Even U.S. 
District Judge Edward J. Garcia noted the defense attorney's difficulty in 
challenging Brennan because most of his conversations were tape-recorded. "It's 
hard to lay a glove on him," the judge said at one point when the jury was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Brennan testified that he believed his dealings with the 
senator would provide him with direct access to Carpenter after he was elected 
to the Board of Equalization, which oversees a variety of tax matters. 
</P>
<P>
During a tape-recorded luncheon meeting at which Brennan delivered a final 
installment of $5,000 to the senator, the agent suggested he might approach 
Carpenter later to help win a tax break for a paper company. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man, you've got access," the senator told him. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan told the jury, "I learned from my time in Sacramento that access was 
hard to obtain. . . . It meant to me I could speak with him when it was 
necessary."

The most common cause of women's injuries -- abuse at home -- is largely 
ignored by doctors, the Journal of the American Medical Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two percent to 35% of women who visit emergency rooms have physical or 
stress-related abuse symptoms, it said. The report said most of the victims are 
"discharged without any arrangements made for their safety, to return to the 
same abusive relationships." But Dr. Jack Allison of the American College of 
Emergency Physicians said the report overstated doctors' shortcomings and 
failed to indicate to what extent women are unwilling to implicate those who 
abuse them.

Coalitions for America, a conservative group, said that Supreme Court nominee 
David H. Souter should not be treated as a politician and asked about his 
personal views on high court rulings during his confirmation hearing. Tom 
Jipping, a representative of the group, which backs Souter, said the Senate 
Judiciary Committee "should not demand (that Souter) bias himself in public" on 
issues he would deal with as a member of the high court. The Souter hearing is

CITY LAWYERS SAY WORKLOAD IS TOO HEAVY; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL LAW: MEMBERS OF LIABILITY DIVISION SAY IN PETITION THAT THEY NEED MORE 
SUPPORT STAFF. THE COMPLAINT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE COST OF SETTLEMENTS IS 
SOARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the city facing an explosion in costly legal settlements, more than half 
of the lawyers in the city attorney's civil liability division have signed a 
petition saying they "can no longer competently and adequately represent the 
best interests" of the city, citing heavy workloads and insufficient support 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, dated Aug. 17 but not delivered to City Atty. James K. Hahn until 
Tuesday, was signed by 28 of the 40 lawyers in the department that defends the 
city against liability lawsuits ranging from automobile accidents to wrongful 
deaths, civil rights abuses and sidewalk slips-and-falls. 
</P>
<P>
Payouts in those cases are now running at a record pace. In the past two years, 
settlement costs have more than doubled. After holding steady at about $15 
million annually through the 1980s, settlements jumped to $34 million in fiscal 
1989-1990, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two months into the 1990-1991 fiscal year, the city has paid out 
about $20 million in liability settlements, according to city figures compiled 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
John Emerson, Hahn's executive assistant, acknowledged that there has been a 
long-running dispute over working conditions in the civil liability division, 
but denied that the situation is affecting the city's legal representation or 
is a factor in the rising settlement costs. 
</P>
<P>
In their petition, the lawyers asked for a "sufficient" but unspecified number 
of attorneys, legal secretaries, law clerks and paralegals, state-of-the-art 
office equipment and office space adequate to support the increased staff. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the city is adequately and well represented," said Emerson. The 
division, he said, wins about 70% of the cases that go to trial, a rate he 
called "doing very well." However, many cases do not go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden rise in legal settlements, he said, could be partly the result of 
"fast track" court reforms implemented two years ago that bring an unusually 
high number of cases to the trial and settlement stage at once. "It's like 
collapsing five years worth of cases into two to three years," said Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
He said the unusually high costs of settling cases recently also reflects the 
long-term trends of more litigation and higher individual settlements. "We're 
in a litigation explosion and the city is a deep-pocket," or target for 
liability lawsuits, Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
The petition was addressed to John T. Neville, a senior assistant city attorney 
and head of the civil liabilities division. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no comment," Neville said. "None whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose Finance and Revenue committee approves 
payouts, said he is concerned about the jump in settlement costs, but feared 
that the problems run deeper than working conditions. Many of the most 
expensive cases, Yaroslavsky said, could have been avoided if city employees 
simply did their jobs correctly. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large I believe we get good (legal) representation by the city 
attorney's office," said Yaroslavsky. "I also believe they are overworked and 
under great stress." 
</P>
<P>
But more staff, he said, may not solve the "liability crisis" that the city is 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office has received one of the largest increases in staff 
of any major city department in the past decade. Since fiscal 1983-1984, 
staffing has grown by 50%, according to figures compiled by Yaroslavsky's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
None of the lawyers who signed the petition could be reached to expand on the 
list of demands, or to say what their next step might be. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson said the lawyers are attempting to "escalate this into a political 
issue," by distributing the petition around City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"They've just got to understand that (the city) is in a budget crunch," said 
Emerson.

OAK PARK MIGHT TRY TO ANNEX HOPE LAND; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE SMALL COMMUNITY CONSIDERS CITYHOOD IN AN EFFORT TO REGULATE 
GROWTH IN THE JORDAN RANCH AND AHMANSON RANCH AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While Simi Valley mulls the idea of annexing Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch, two 
officials of the small community of Oak Park said Tuesday that they want to 
form a city and annex the entertainer's land and Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park advisory council members say the two developments will have a profound 
effect on their community, which is just west of Jordan Ranch, and they should 
be able to regulate growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's going to be any annexing taking place, it should be Oak Park," 
Councilman Duane Skavdahl said. "We're the ones who are right next door. We're 
a player in this game, and we need to do something to get people's attention." 
</P>
<P>
Skavdahl said he will bring the issue up at the Oak Park Municipal Advisory 
Council meeting Tuesday. If the council agrees to begin incorporation 
proceedings, the community could start a petition drive to collect 25%, or 
about 4,000, of voters' signatures to put a cityhood proposal before the Local 
Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
If the city is incorporated, it would return to the county agency to receive 
permission to annex the two developments, which combined would include nearly 
4,000 homes, several golf courses, two hotels, a shopping center and several 
office complexes. Oak Park officials estimate that the annexation process could 
take two years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LAFCO on Sept. 12 will discuss the possibility of allowing Simi 
Valley to move ahead with the annexation of Jordan Ranch into its city. Simi 
Valley has asked the local planning agency for a preliminary ruling on the 
matter before moving ahead with the lengthy process of amending its General 
Plan to include the Hope property. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Skavdahl said, it is important that Oak Park move forward quickly 
or "we could be left in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Although some county officials said Tuesday that it makes more sense for Oak 
Park than for Simi Valley to annex Jordan Ranch, the small community would face 
several obstacles if it decides to form a city. 
</P>
<P>
Because Oak Park and Jordan Ranch include little commercial development, the 
city would lack an important source of revenue. And although Ahmanson Ranch 
would have enough commercial and industrial development to sustain the city, 
some county officials doubt whether the ranch could be included as part of Oak 
Park, since Cheeseboro Canyon, part of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, divides the communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It just isn't feasible," said Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer. 
"Geographically, there are problems." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Oak Park Councilman Ron Stark said the community has to explore 
its options or risk being landlocked if Simi Valley decides to annex Jordan 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be turned into an island with no chance of developing," Stark said. 
Yet the city's roads would serve Jordan Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be the most impacted, and yet we would have little impact on what's 
going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the two developments said they would favor joining Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," said Donald H. Brackenbush, president of Ahmanson Ranch Land Co. 
"I think it could work." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investments Associates, which has an 
option to buy Jordan Ranch, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Oak Park are obviously our neighbors," Maas said. 
</P>
<P>
The annexation frenzy began several weeks ago when Hope asked Simi Valley to 
take over 2,308 acres of his Jordan Ranch property south of Simi Valley and 
3,495 acres of his Runkle Ranch northeast of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hope officials said the Simi Valley annexation proposal was prompted partly by 
the election in June to the Board of Supervisors of slow-growth advocate Maria 
K. VanderKolk, who narrowly defeated Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk's campaign centered on her opposition to the Jordan Ranch 
development and a controversial land swap proposal involving federal parkland, 
which would be necessary for the project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the National Park Service would swap 59 acres of parkland 
needed for an access road to the Jordan Ranch subdivision for 1,100 acres of 
the ranch. Also, Hope is selling and donating more than 4,500 acres in the 
Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to park agencies for a below-market $10 
million.

GIRLFRIEND ARRESTED WITH SUSPECT IN SCHOOL SLAYING

A man suspected of gunning down three people at a West Covina vocational school 
has been arrested in Mexico, and his girlfriend -- originally thought to be his 
kidnap victim -- was booked Tuesday as an accessory to murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Meza, 24, a reputed gang member from Duarte, and Lisa Villela, 19, a 
former nursing student, were found Sunday evening in the Mexican border city of 
Mexicali and placed under arrest by the Mexican state police. 
</P>
<P>
Police originally surmised that Villela had been kidnaped by Meza when 
relatives were unable to reach her after the shootings. The two apparently fled 
to Mexico with their infant son after the shootings last Thursday left one 
woman dead and two men wounded, police said.

"The more and more (investigators) got into it, the less and less it looked 
like she was a victim," Lt. Jim Dillon of the West Covina Police Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Meza claimed to be a Mexican national and was being held in a 
Mexicali jail pending efforts to extradite him. Villela, a U.S. citizen, was 
immediately turned over to West Covina detectives who had traveled to the 
border city. She was returned to West Covina Tuesday night, where she was 
booked and held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Their 18-month-old son, whom they had taken with them to Mexico, was released 
to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Meza allegedly pulled a gun and opened fire on the campus of the North-West 
College of Medical &amp; Dental Assistants last Thursday. A teacher was killed 
and a counselor and a student were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Meza then allegedly jumped into the passenger seat of a waiting car and sped 
away. Villela's relatives at the time expressed fears for her safety because 
she had not been seen in the two days before the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
But police now say she was probably the getaway driver and went along with Meza 
willingly. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said the pair had been seen together often after the shootings, and had 
registered under Villela's name at a Mexicali motel. He said several friends of 
the couple, interviewed by investigators, indicated it was unlikely that Meza 
had kidnaped her. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina police alerted the Border Patrol and officers in several Mexican 
cities after the couple fled. Mexican state police, conducting a motel-to-motel 
search, found that the couple had registered on Sunday, but the room was empty. 
Later, officers found the pair walking down a street with their baby, said 
Ricardo Rojas, head of the police unit that made the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas also said Villela appeared to be accompanying Meza of her own free will. 
"They seemed at ease together, like newlyweds," Rojas said in a telephone 
interview from Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas said Meza told investigators he suspected that his girlfriend was having 
an affair with someone at the school. Dillon said that such a motive, among 
others, was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon added that Villela is about five months pregnant.

CHAMBER FEARS MARON TO DELAY GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Area Chamber of Commerce is worried that Councilwoman Dorothy Maron 
will try to stall a series of hearings next week on a new General Plan in an 
effort to make a stand on growth and bolster her campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The concern was expressed in a report released Tuesday by a chamber 
subcommittee on governmental relations and business development. 
</P>
<P>
During several all-day meetings next week, the Oxnard City Council is expected 
to consider and adopt the plan, which is designed to guide development in the 
city until the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that Councilwoman Dorothy Maron may attempt to stall the process 
and delay the General Plan issue to the election time-frame in order to 
politicize the issue of growth," said a report describing the outcome of a 
subcommittee meeting on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
The report urges chamber members to discourage Maron from taking such actions. 
"Something as important as a 30-year general plan should not be turned into a 
political circus," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Maron characterized the allegations as "baloney." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she has been critical of the plan and said she will 
continue to criticize the document at next week's hearings. "That's my job," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Maron said that even if she wanted to stall adoption of the plan, she would 
need the support of at least two other council members to win a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Maulhardt, chairman of the chamber subcommittee that produced the 
report, said he believes that Maron will use the hearings to make a stand on 
growth because "she wants to be elected mayor on a no-growth or slow-growth 
platform." 
</P>
<P>
Maron, who has recently called for restraints on development in the city, has 
filed the necessary documents to challenge Mayor Nao Takasugi in the November 
elections. Takasugi, who has supported the pace of development in the city, is 
considered a "pro-growth" candidate. 
</P>
<P>
To buttress his theory, Maulhardt pointed out that in April, when the plan was 
being considered by the Planning Commission, Maron criticized it as being "very 
pro-growth." 
</P>
<P>
Maulhardt noted that, in that same month, Maron also proposed forming a 
committee of residents and council members to review the plan because she said 
it failed to adequately address ways to regulate or limit traffic levels, 
residential growth and "high-risk" industries. 
</P>
<P>
However, Maron withdrew her proposal a week later without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Maulhardt presented the council with a letter urging it to adopt 
the new General Plan without further delay. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan was first studied over a 2 1/2-year period by a 22-member 
group of residents and has been under review by the Planning Commission since 
June, 1989. The council has scheduled four days of meetings next week to 
consider public input on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The document projects a population increase of 41,000 and a 135% increase in 
commercial development. The plan has been criticized by groups such as the 
Navy, the California Coastal Commission, the city of Ventura and local 
slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that the political atmosphere may slow the General Plan process 
further," Maulhardt said, adding that until the new plan is adopted, the city 
has delayed approval of special land use permits. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is urging members of the chamber to write or telephone Maron to 
discourage her from trying to stall adoption of the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Maulhardt said the Oxnard Area Chamber of Commerce is prohibited by its bylaws 
to endorse or oppose any candidate in the election.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
With polls showing that half of Southern California's residents are pondering a 
move elsewhere, local publications are filled with real estate pitches from 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
One of the latest touts "great terms" on "comfortable houses," ranging from 
$11,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
They're located in sunny El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that various amusement parks claim to offer the world's "scariest ride," 
we recently mentioned some real-life freeway maneuvers that are far more 
frightening. For instance, there's "Raging Drivers" -- almost any off-ramp of 
the Pasadena Freeway where motorists must slow from 70 m.p.h. to 10 m.p.h. or 
so to negotiate a 90-degree turn. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Cowle of Pacific Palisades came up with another: 
</P>
<P>
Traveling south on the San Diego Freeway, "just try to exit at Valley View," 
Cowle wrote. "As you attempt to cross several lanes of traffic exiting the 
eastbound Ventura Freeway for the southbound San Diego, you are taking your 
life into your hands. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There you have it -- the Ventura Viper. 
</P>
<P>
The free-fare period on the Metro Blue Line is over. But Jon Stringer figures 
he more than broke even on the $1.10 ride Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
As he boarded at the Del Amo station, he was honored with a cake in the shape 
of a train and given several free monthly passes and other gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Stringer, 52, was so honored for having the wisdom to be the 1-millionth rider 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher at Steven White Junior High in Carson, he was doubly delighted 
because he's a railroad enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youth, my family used to live in Hollywood and I rode the 
Hollywood line of the Pacific Electric Red Cars," he said. "Later, we lived in 
Glendale and I used to ride to downtown Los Angeles to the Subway Terminal 
Building." 
</P>
<P>
If the latter doesn't ring a bell, it's because L.A.'s mile-long subway 
operated only from 1926 to 1955; it started downtown and emerged near the 
intersection of Beverly and Glendale boulevards. The prevailing wisdom when it 
was shut down was that L.A. would do just fine with autos and buses. Yup. 
</P>
<P>
No less an authority than "60 Minutes" once termed Venice the Roller Skating 
Capital of the World. 
</P>
<P>
But reckless skating is a problem, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said Tuesday. And 
so the City Council adopted her measure to forbid wild maneuvering aboard 
bicycles, skateboards or other "human-powered" devices. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Police Capt. Patrick C. Froehle, who said the ordinance will authorize 
officers to issue tickets, emphasized that the city wasn't outlawing skating. 
</P>
<P>
The city knows better than to try that. A year ago, a flock of angry Venetians, 
led by Harry Parry, the roller-skating musician, and Liz (Skateboard Momma) 
Bevington, flocked to City Hall when signs banning skating were posted on Ocean 
Front Walk. The signs were removed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Joanie Garratt, a Venetian skater, said: "The practical effect of this 
law would be to make it virtually illegal to skate in Venice." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Venice can always repeal the law when it secedes from L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Jinny Spurgeon has one question regarding the winning site of this week's 
Dueling Signs Competition (see photo) at Silver Spur Road and Montemalaga Drive 
in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
What does a driver do when the signal's red? 
</P>
<P>

A crowd of 40,000 at Dodger Stadium will consume, on the average, about 34,000 
hot dogs, 68,000 bags of peanuts, 26,000 beers, 26,000 soft drinks, 13,000 ice 
creams and 1,340 cups of coffee.

An Oxnard electrician checking wires in the attic of an Ojai house Tuesday 
apparently electrocuted himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old man, who was working in a house in the 600 block of Del Norte 
Road, sent his partner to pick up some parts about 5 p.m. When the partner 
returned, he found the man dead with electrical burns on his face, chest and 
right hand, said Lt. Joe Funchess of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County coroner's office could not release the victim's name Tuesday 
evening. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY HOSPITALS BEGIN OUTPATIENT SERVICE 
CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Los Angeles County hospitals Tuesday began implementing a 9.5% cut in 
outpatient services to the poor -- an action that health officials said will 
result in longer waits for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were ordered earlier this month by the Board of Supervisors in 
response to a shortfall in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
They will result in a reduction of 11,508 outpatient visits a month to 
County-USC, Harbor-UCLA, Martin Luther King-Drew, Rancho Los Amigos and Olive 
View medical centers, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The length of the wait will depend on the clinic. At County-USC's surgery 
clinic, which evaluates patients before and after surgery, patients who 
currently wait eight weeks face a 12-week wait, said a health department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
County Health Director Robert Gates told supervisors the cuts will cause 100 
layoffs.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FILM PERMIT CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Camarillo City Council will consider new guidelines today for motion 
picture filming and farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
The changes to the city's zoning ordinance for film permits have been requested 
to conform to state law, according to a California Film Commission official. 
</P>

"The law attempts to standardize filming permits in California and cut through 
bureaucratic red tape," Michael Walbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities are asked to adopt a process for granting film permits or tell the 
California Film Commission why they do not want such a permit process. Only a 
few requests a year are received by Camarillo for filming permits. 
</P>
<P>
"What the state is mandating, we've been doing all along," said Tony Boden, 
director of planning and community development. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council will consider permits for farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
Only growers who have been certified by the county's agricultural commissioner 
will be allowed to participate in the market. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL OKS CURBSIDE PLAN FOR RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Joining the recycling efforts of six other cities in the county, the Oxnard 
City Council voted Tuesday to start a curbside recycling program for 3,000 
residents beginning in December. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, the council voted unanimously to share with the city of 
Port Hueneme the cost and services of a full-time recycling officer. 
</P>
<P>
The actions were part of Oxnard's efforts to meet the mandates of a recently 
adopted state law that requires every city to reduce waste by 25% by the year 
1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The annual salary of the recycling officer will be $53,280. Because Port 
Hueneme is a much smaller city and will generate less waste, it will only pay 
12.5% of that cost, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the City Council had approved the hiring of the recycling officer, 
but the position remains vacant. City officials said the position will be 
filled within two months. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Ventura, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula, Fillmore and 
Ojai operate some type of curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city report, the pilot curbside recycling program in Oxnard will 
begin in December and be evaluated after six months. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, residents will be asked to separate aluminum cans, 
newspaper, glass and plastic beverage bottles from other waste and place the 
recyclables in containers provided by the city at a cost of $12,000, according 
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members will implement the program in selected neighborhoods that 
represent a demographic cross-section of the city's residents, the report said.

L.A.-AFRICA PANEL REALLY OWES ST. JOHN MONEY, LAWYER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: ACCOUNTANT'S REPORT SHOWS THAT TRADE TASK FORCE IS IN DEBT TO HIS 
CLIENT FOR MORE THAN $6,000 IN SALARY AND OTHER EXPENSES, ATTORNEY ARGUES. 
</P>

<P>
Juanita St. John's attorney said Tuesday that a city-funded Los Angeles-Africa 
trade task force she is charged with bilking actually owes her more than 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the fullest public accounting yet by St. John of how she spent task force 
money, attorney Victor Sherman presented in court an accountant's report 
concluding that St. John was entitled to the approximately $178,000 she is 
charged with stealing from the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The report, introduced at a preliminary hearing, indicates that $110,000 of the 
money was compensation due St. John as part of an annual salary of about 
$75,000. Another $29,300 was repayment of a loan by St. John's husband to the 
task force and the remainder was reimbursement for her expenses over several 
years, including trips to Washington, mileage, credit card payments and office 
expenses, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution produced records Tuesday indicating that the large withdrawals 
St. John made from task force accounts over the years went to pay personal 
debts, including loan payments of up to $39,000 on her San Marino home. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, a friend and former business partner of Mayor Tom Bradley, is charged 
with grand theft and filing false tax returns in connection with her activities 
on behalf of the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations. The hearing 
before Municipal Court Judge David Doi is to determine if she should stand 
trial on the charges, which carry a possible prison term of seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said St. John's new accounting report shows the task force owes her 
$6,474. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which was challenged by the prosecution, included some 
documentation in support of the expenses, as well as copies of checks for 
nearly $30,000 that St. John's husband wrote to the task force in 1981 and 
1982, when it was struggling for funds. The accountant who prepared the report, 
Lionel Sanders, said he has additional receipts to back up the report. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have testified that St. John probably used some of her own money to 
subsidize the task force in the early years. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Licker said outside the courtroom that there is 
no evidence St. John was entitled to draw the salary she claims. He also noted 
it took St. John more than a year after a city subpoena was issued to produce 
her explanation of where the task force money went. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had this (documentation), you'd think it would have been presented in 
the first place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney investigative auditor Hassan Attalla said that, in his 
opinion, St. John's accounting of the funds lacked supporting evidence. But he 
acknowledged under questioning by Sherman that he had not sought clarification 
of St. John's accounting.

SUICIDE WATCH PUT ON SLAYING SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE MAN, WHO ALLEGEDLY SHOT HIS DAUGHTER AND HER BOYFRIEND, IS BEING 
HELD IN A PSYCHIATRIC WING OF COUNTY JAIL. HE HAD LEFT A NOTE AT HOME 
THREATENING TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

<P>
A gunman who walked into the sheriff's substation in the City of Industry -- 
apparently to confess that he had shot his daughter and her boyfriend -- on 
Tuesday was being held in a psychiatric wing of County Jail to guard against a 
suicide attempt, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Jimmy Joe Gregory, 56, who was arrested Monday after a 
90-minute standoff with deputies in the station, had left a note in his West 
Covina home threatening to take his own life. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of his daughter, Vera Nadine Gregory, 27, and her boyfriend, Charles 
A. Franklin Jr., 40, both of whom lived with the suspect, were found in a car 
parked in a handicapped space outside the station. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was a heavy drinker and had been receiving disability payments for a 
range of medical problems, said Mike Scott, sheriff's homicide investigator. 
His wife, who had been out of town, told deputies that Gregory had been 
distraught over financial and family difficulties, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just gave us the feeling that he wanted to talk to someone," said Deputy 
Brett Lisle, who was in the station at the time. "He said his family members 
didn't need him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy, Ron Cross, told the Associated Press that he helped break the 
ice during the standoff by offering the gunman a drink of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had to try and form a rapport with someone and keep in mind I may have 
to kill him," Cross said. "I made a deal with him," Cross continued. "I 
promised to get him Jim Beam and Coke if he would put the gun down." 
</P>
<P>
When Gregory agreed, deputies rushed to a store to buy the beverages. Gregory 
unloaded the gun and put it down after he was given the drink, though he 
promptly picked it up and and reloaded it, Cross said. Gregory put the gun down 
again at 7 p.m., Cross grabbed it, and Gregory was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives at Gregory's home declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting Monday marked at least the fourth time in the last week that a Los 
Angeles County man, troubled by domestic woes, had allegedly resorted to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged perpetrators ranged from a 40-year-old Hollywood butcher who 
apparently shot himself after killing his wife and three children to a Van Nuys 
restaurant owner who shot his wife, then himself, after she served him with 
divorce papers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cases were not connected, psychologists theorized that the crimes 
shared a common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Mohandie, a psychological assistant for the Los Angeles Police Department, 
said suicides and murders occasionally occur in clusters. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there's an element of seeing other people resolving their problems 
this way," he said. "All of a sudden, it becomes one of the options." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot hopelessness and helplessness out there," added Sidney Brown, an 
Encino psychologist and vice president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of 
the National Council on Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency. 
</P>
<P>
"Homicide and suicide are the last desperate acts of protest against not 
getting one's needs met."

RAPE SUSPECT IS BEATEN BY JAIL INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of raping and torturing two women held captive in a camper and, 
later, of knifing a bailiff during a court hearing was badly beaten by another 
inmate in Los Angeles County Jail, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Garcia, 38, remained in critical condition after more than a week in 
intensive care. He suffered a fractured skull and a collapsed lung as a result 
of the beating, Sheriff's Lt. Taylor Moorehead said. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Edward Harris, convicted of murder and awaiting transportation to state 
prison, argued with Garcia, then "seized the opportunity" to beat and kick him, 
Moorehead said. Deputies rushed to Garcia's rescue but not in time to spare him 
from serious injury, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat him real hard and real fast," Moorehead said, adding that Harris is 
over 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The beating took place on Aug. 8 but was not disclosed until now. Harris has 
been charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was removed from intensive care on Monday but cannot talk and has 
difficulty breathing, according to the prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Andrew J. McMullen. "At one point, they were concerned he would not 
live," said McMullen, who was briefed by the judge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's attorney, Sue Brown, said she was concerned about whether her client's 
mental capacities are intact after the beating. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said her client was in no condition to attend his next scheduled court 
hearing on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The beating in jail was only the latest twist in a bizarre case. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who also uses the name of Robert Gonzalez, is accused of using chains 
and electrical shocks to hold two immigrant women captive in a camper. He, his 
alleged victims, two female accomplices and five small children lived in the 
camper as it crisscrossed poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles for months. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of repeatedly raping the two women, who finally escaped before 
Garcia was arrested last fall. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing for the rape case last June, Garcia allegedly pulled a knife 
on a bailiff who was taking him to court, slashing the bailiff's face and 
chest. He was charged with attempted murder, attempted escape and other counts 
related to that attack. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was injured in a raucous scuffle with deputy marshals who rescued the 
bailiff and subdued Garcia. Because of his injuries in that incident, Garcia's 
hearings were postponed until this month.

BRADLEY PROPOSES LINKING THE CITY TO 140-LANGUAGE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday proposed a pilot program that would 
provide callers with interpreters of 140 languages in an effort to open city 
government to an expanding immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
"The 3.4 million residents of Los Angeles come here from all over the world," 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our rich cultural and ethnic diversity is one of our greatest strengths, but 
it requires us to ensure our services can adapt to the wide range of people who 
reside here. . . . This program will make it possible for people to talk to us 
no matter what their language," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's proposal, five city departments -- Fire, Police, Library, 
Airports and Community Development -- would contribute $10,000 each for a six- 
to nine-month pilot program to tie into AT&amp;T's Language Line. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T employs an undisclosed number of interpreters in 140 languages and 
dialects on a 24-hour basis. When a city department receives a call from a 
non-English-speaking resident, the call would be tied into the AT&amp;T 
Language Line for a three-way conversation with an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
The service, founded in 1984 and bought by AT&amp;T last year, is already used 
by scores of cities in all 50 states, said Jeffrey J. Munks, director of 
marketing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though our city boasts a multilingual work force," Bradley said, "there 
is no way each department has the capability to translate as many as 140 
different languages and dialects." 
</P>
<P>
Most cities -- such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and Anchorage -- 
use the interpreter service primarily for their 911 emergency phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's plan, non-English-speaking residents would be able to get 
access to the widest range of departments of any of the cities now using the 
service. City officials said the service costs $1.94 per minute, but were 
unable to estimate the total annual cost. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo agreed to carry the proposal in the City Council and on 
Tuesday he introduced a motion urging adoption of the plan. He said the program 
is a "recognition of the realities" of life in Los Angeles. Bradley said that 
it would take several months to get council approval for the program.

<P>
Armenian lawmakers voted Tuesday in favor of a declaration reasserting their 
homeland's independence. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Azerbaijan, President Ayaz N. Mutalibov said regional strife has 
reached such a pitch that the entire population of the republic is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Against a background of renewed guerrilla attacks by Azerbaijani and Armenian 
vigilantes, the Armenian Supreme Soviet, the republic's Legislature, approved a 
preamble and 10 articles of a "Declaration on Armenia's Independent Statehood," 
said Ovanes Muradyan of the Armenian National Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration casts aside the Communist-inspired label of Armenian Soviet 
Socialist Republic and renames the mountainous land of 3.5 million people the 
Republic of Armenia. This is the name Armenia had from 1918 to 1920, before the 
Bolsheviks took power. 
</P>
<P>
Article 1 of the declaration announces the start of a gradual process toward 
independence, putting the government in Yerevan, the republic's capital, on the 
course chosen by Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration provides for locally controlled "security forces" to protect 
Armenia and its people and, despite appeals and decrees from Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, envisages a separate currency, tax system, customs 
service and banks. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Supreme Soviet was to be reconvened today to vote on an 11th 
article that would make the declaration the basis for a new constitution, and 
possibly on a 12th clause condemning the genocide of Armenians at the hands of 
the Ottoman Turks. A vote on the declaration as a whole will also be taken. 
</P>
<P>
In Azerbaijan, Mutalibov, who is also head of the republic's Communist Party, 
said in a televised speech that his government will have to act to protect 
Azerbaijan's sovereignty in the face of renewed attacks by Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the speech followed "dramatic 
aggravation of the situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border" in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Gorbachev ordered the ethnic-based irregular armies disbanded by force 
if they failed to do it voluntarily, but Armenia's new president, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, persuaded Moscow-based officials to extend the deadline by two 
months while he works to bring these elements under the control of the Armenian 
Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to armed attacks over the weekend and attacks on a bus and villages 
in Azerbaijan, Mutalibov called Gorbachev's flexibility a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Mutalibov said the existence of Azerbaijan's 6.9 million people has been 
endangered and that Azerbaijan may appeal for "international solidarity." He 
was not specific but may have been referring to ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran; to 
Turkey, with whom Azerbaijanis share linguistic and historical ties, or to 
other Muslim peoples. Most Armenians are Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged Transcaucasus region has been on the boil for more than 2 1/2 years 
because of a bitter territorial dispute over which of the two republics should 
govern the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave 
surrounded by Azerbaijan.

GERMAN UNITY ACCORD UNRAVELS WITHIN HOURS;

<P>
East Germans worked out an agreement Tuesday on political unity between the two 
Germanys for Oct. 14, but it unraveled within hours, adding to the mounting 
confusion about the unification process. 
</P>
<P>
The brief accord between the major East German political parties appeared to 
have ended weeks of chaos and bitter infighting over the date for unification. 
</P>
<P>
But, soon thereafter, East Germany's second-biggest party, the Social 
Democratic Party, backed away from the approval given by its leader in 
Parliament, Richard Schroeder, and declared that it would not agree to the 
October date. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became apparent that Schroeder had agreed to Oct. 14 without 
consulting with other members of his party in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder promptly resigned and was replaced by the party chairman, Wolfgang 
Thierse. Then, after a marathon meeting of the party's 88 members of 
Parliament, Thierse announced late Tuesday that the Social Democrats would 
stick with their demand that unification take place earlier, preferably on 
Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The episode underscored the unpredictable nature of the fledgling East German 
democracy, which, with little experience and no tradition, has lurched from 
crisis to crisis in the four months since it was created. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached early Tuesday appeared to have been an important 
concession by the Social Democrats, who had pushed for early unification in an 
effort to stem the disintegration of the East German economy. 
</P>
<P>
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who announced the earlier accord 
to reporters in East Berlin, said that 10 of the 12 parties represented in the 
Volkskammer, or Parliament, had agreed to meet in special session on Oct. 9 to 
prepare a declaration of unity. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Communists, now known as the Party of Democratic Socialism, and 
Bundnis 90, a small group that played a key part in last autumn's revolution, 
initially opposed the move. They wanted unity on the day of the first 
all-German elections, scheduled for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the terms of unity has slowed West German investment in East 
Germany to below expected levels, and West German government officials have 
complained that key financial assistance has been seriously slowed by East 
German bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Political figures on both sides agreed that accelerating the pace of unity 
would likely help with these problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, and 
Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic candidate for chancellor in the 
December elections, issued a joint statement emphasizing the need for clarity 
in the unity process, but even that indicated a desire to stick with the 
earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have liked it (unity) even earlier," Lafontaine told a radio interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Some Social Democrats, in both German parliaments, had called for immediate 
unity. But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and De Maiziere have resisted the 
earlier date, claiming that it would interfere with international commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Unity before mid-September would put it ahead of the final round of talks on 
international aspects of unification, talks involving both Germanys and the 
World War II allies, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
These talks are scheduled for Sept. 12 in Moscow, and a final accord could be 
initialed there by the six foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is expected to obtain 
a go-ahead on unification from the foreign ministers of many East and West 
European countries at a meeting in New York, on Oct. 2, of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. All the countries of Europe except Albania 
are represented in the organization.

ISSUE OF WIDE-OPEN BETTING TO LURE TOURISTS SPLITS ALASKA;

FAIRBANKS, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is still a feel of the old Klondike in Alaska. A family can build a house 
without a lot of permits here. You can grow a little marijuana and nobody will 
bother you. Signs saying "No Shooting" sometimes add the word Please out of 
respect for folks who don't like taking orders. People here have a pretty firm 
idea of what freedom means to them. 
</P>
<P>
So, at first glance, it is something of a curiosity to find Alaska embroiled in 
an all-out political debate this summer over something so seemingly part of its 
sourdough heritage -- gambling. 
</P>
<P>
In a primary election Tuesday, Alaskans will vote on a 16-line ballot 
proposition designed to open the way for legalized gambling -- all varieties of 
it. Currently, gambling is limited to charity bingo and ubiquitous "pull tabs," 
those little paper novelties with which, like scratch-off lottery tickets, you 
win cash for matching numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the idea of enlarging gambling and making it a state-regulated industry 
has triggered a debate over just what is Alaska, and what should it be. 
</P>
<P>
A small, loose-knit group of businessmen and a political consultant claim 
credit for the gambling ballot proposition and for obtaining the 23,000 
signatures to qualify it for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman says that the motive for the measure is simple: Alaska's great 
outdoor beauty makes it a desirable tourist destination, but gambling will give 
visitors something exciting and extra to do at night and during the long 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
"Face it, people come here and in the evenings there aren't a lot of things to 
do," said Jeff Macktaz, an Anchorage music and concert producer. "Opponents 
paint a picture of Atlantic City or Las Vegas. I don't want that, either. I see 
more of a Lake Tahoe." 
</P>
<P>
Macktaz is one of those who helped qualify the initiative in a drive that has 
taken two years. One other key backer has moved to Florida during that time. 
Still others are hard to identify or contact. There is no headquarters and no 
visibly organized campaign behind the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Macktaz, this is just a laid-back, easygoing effort to see how 
Alaskans feel about legalized gambling. If it is passed during this election, 
the measure requires local approval before any gambling licenses are issued. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think the Trumps and the Mirages are standing at the border 
waiting to come in. Not so, they don't even return phone calls," Macktaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, perhaps the big casino operators are not licking their chops at the idea 
of opening the Far North to gambling. But opponents aren't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
"This would change Alaska more than anything since the pipeline," said Gov. 
Steve Cowper, a Democrat and the measure's most vociferous critic. " . . . 
Full-scale casino gambling is fundamentally at odds with the kind of Alaska I 
would like to live in. And it comes down to a matter of personal values." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but what about Alaska's whiskey, gold and gambling heritage? 
</P>
<P>
Cowper and others say that is different. He said he would not object to what is 
known as "historic" gambling, the kind that is permitted in Dawson, in Canada's 
Yukon -- old saloons with chorus lines, stand-up bars and gambling games. 
Theme-park gambling. 
</P>
<P>
And Cowper also would not object to opening state ferry boats to gambling, just 
as the cruise lines have been. 
</P>
<P>
But what has the governor and others fuming is the vision of huge gambling 
industrialists moving into Alaska, without regard to the sensibilities of its 
half-million residents, many of whom are here because they want to be away from 
the neon rat-race of the Lower 48. 
</P>
<P>
Alaskans will have their say on their future next week.

POST-MORTEMS SHOW THAT JURORS LIKE IT KEPT SIMPLE

<P>
The federal government's stunning defeats in the cocaine trial of District of 
Columbia Mayor Marion Barry and the trials of other recent high-profile 
defendants are providing law enforcement officials with a hard-learned lesson 
for handling such cases in the future: 
</P>
<P>
Keep them simple, so juries can understand what is involved. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of simplicity is not necessarily the major reason that the prosecution 
lost the Barry case, in which racial attitudes, jurors' doubts about an FBI 
sting operation and the credibility of some government witnesses also played a 
part. But it certainly was a factor, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
But the complexity of such cases is becoming a growing problem as the Justice 
Department moves more and more into high-profile trials involving public 
officials and financial schemes -- and loses them, embarrassingly, as the Barry 
case underscores. 
</P>
<P>
"Juries don't like complex cases with a lot of documents," says Joseph E. 
DiGenova, former U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, who has interviewed 
jurors for dozens of post-mortems in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, prosecutors in the Justice Department's stepped-up assault against 
fraud in the savings and loan industry are seeking to simplify unusually 
complex cases, both to avoid overwhelming juries and to conserve the time of 
investigators and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, underscored this concern recently in 
announcing one of the bigger S&amp;L prosecutions -- the indictment on 27 
criminal counts against Edwin T. McBirney III, former chairman and major 
shareholder of Sunbelt Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This criminal case is designed to be lean, trim, to the point," Collins said. 
"In any case that is this complex, you have to be mindful of the fact that 
jurors can only absorb so much and can only understand so much." 
</P>
<P>
The setback in the Barry case -- which ended with a conviction on a 
misdemeanor, an acquittal on another and a hung jury on 12 other charges -- 
follows numerous similar headline-grabbing reversals that together have raised 
serious questions about the government's success rate. 
</P>
<P>
Winning such cases is "important in terms of the public perception of the 
(criminal justice) process," DiGenova says. 
</P>
<P>
But federal statistics show that, despite the increased complexity of such 
cases, the success rate for federal prosecutions generally has actually 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Counting only those cases that actually went to trial, the government won 88% 
of its cases in the first six months of fiscal 1990, up from 77% in 1989, 78% 
in 1985 and 81% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Although memories may be short, prosecutors can point to a spate of significant 
victories in celebrated cases over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond kingpin Michael Milken recently pleaded guilty to six felony counts. 
Hotel magnate Leona Helmsley was convicted of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
And television evangelist Jim Bakker was convicted of fraud and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Post-mortems of unsuccessful prosecutions can lead to fundamental changes in 
law enforcement procedures -- including revising the way the FBI trains its 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
A review of the government's embarrassing loss in the 1984 cocaine-trafficking 
prosecution of John Z. DeLorean showed that jurors simply did not believe the 
FBI agents at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the agency introduced moot-court training at its national academy 
in Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the current round of post-mortems, federal officials have found that no 
single thread seems to link the big-case losses that the government has 
suffered this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the Imelda Marcos case, for example, the prosecution was hampered from the 
outset by the fact that her husband, ex-Philippine President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos, had died six months before, and the jury was reluctant to convict Mrs. 
Marcos by herself. 
</P>
<P>
"When was the last time we put a Godfather's wife in jail?" a disgruntled FBI 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the lesser-charge convictions won last month against several Chicago 
commodities traders who were charged with fraud, the government suffered from 
bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a fluke, the weakest of the government's cases went to trial first, 
and the jury found two traders guilty of relatively minor crimes, sharply 
reducing the incentive for defendants in remaining cases to begin cooperating 
with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The government should have done a better job of restructuring," a Justice 
Department official concedes. 
</P>

EGYPT SAID TO SEEK ISRAELI OUTLET FOR REFUGEES

Despite Egypt's denials, Israeli Foreign Ministry sources said Tuesday that 
Egypt has inquired about the possibility of moving Egyptian refugees from Iraq 
through the Israeli port of Eilat. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 Egyptians fleeing Iraq and occupied Kuwait are waiting in the 
Jordanian port of Aqaba for transportation home. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador in Jerusalem, Mohammed Bassiouny, reportedly asked 
Foreign Minister David Levy on Monday about allowing them to pass through 
nearby Eilat en route to Taba in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Levy agreed in principle, the Foreign Ministry sources said, and Bassiouny was 
to consult with his government on details. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Levy told Bassiouny: "It is natural that Israel lend its 
assistance to those from a friendly state who flee to their homeland fearing 
tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials issued a denial Tuesday in Cairo after the exchange was 
leaked to the press here, resulting in what was described as embarrassment at 
the premature disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Egyptian migrant workers in Iraq and Kuwait have traveled through 
Jordan to Aqaba and then by ferry to Egypt, either to the Sinai port of Nuweiba 
or to Suez City. 
</P>
<P>
If they are permitted to pass through Eilat, which is only a mile or two from 
Aqaba, it would ease considerably the jam of refugees at Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 Egyptians have been working in Iraq, their usual numbers 
increased by the recent Iraq-Iran War. Most young Iraqis were conscripted into 
military service, causing a shortage of workers. Like other foreigners in Iraq 
and Kuwait, many Egyptians have fled for home since Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait 
on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Rafi Hoffman of Eilat said Tuesday that, if asked, his staff would assist 
in the transfer of Egyptian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that if we get notice, we will do everything possible to help," 
Hoffman said. "We have been looking for many years to open a bridge with 
Aqaba." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has no official border crossing into Israel in the Eilat-Aqaba area. The 
only such crossings are at bridges over the Jordan River to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Supreme Court decided to reject a petition demanding the 
immediate distribution of gas masks to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ernst, a lawyer and legal adviser to the Israel Consumer Council, had 
asked the court to force distribution of gas masks on grounds that there may 
not be enough time in the event of an attack. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the matter is not a judicial one and should be decided by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
The argument over gas masks, which has developed since the invasion of Kuwait, 
has become a political issue within the conservative government of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials contend that a premature move could cause panic and serve to 
provoke Iraq, but Foreign Minister Levy has taken the position that the masks 
should be distributed now. Defense Minister Moshe Arens says they will be 
delivered at the appropriate time.

EGYPT: CAIRO SENDS FIRST ELEMENTS OF MECHANIZED INFANTRY DIVISION, TANKS AND

<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday appealed to Iraq to withdraw its 
forces from Kuwait, while at the same time Egypt reportedly sent the first 
elements of a mechanized infantry division to Saudi Arabia, along with light 
tanks and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
The government interrupted radio and television programming to broadcast 
Mubarak's appeal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak asked Hussein, "in the name of everything sacred on our Arab soil . . . 
in the name of Islam," to prevent "a destructive war that will devour 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Egypt -- and no other government -- has a serious proposal that 
might lead to a negotiated settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis. A Western 
diplomat said Mubarak's statement was propaganda aimed at polishing his image 
as a peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak not only demanded that Iraq pull its troops out of Kuwait, but he also 
called on Iraq to compensate Egyptian workers who lost their jobs in Kuwait and 
Egyptians whose accounts in Kuwaiti banks have been frozen by Iraqi occupation 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
For domestic purposes, diplomatic sources said, making these demands gives 
Mubarak a basis for sending troops to the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on the last stop of a four-day tour 
of Arab capitals, met for an hour with Egyptian Defense Minister Youssef abu 
Taleb to compare notes on the military situation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cheney had met with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and told reporters 
afterward that the United States is considering selling additional jet 
fighters, tanks, missiles and chemical warfare protection gear to the Saudis. 
He said Washington will speed delivery of military equipment already in the 
pipeline, including F-15 fighter planes and tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously are looking at aircraft," he said. "We are looking at munitions 
that go on the aircraft. We are looking at chemical protection gear which the 
Saudis want. We are looking at the problem near-term and long-term, and we will 
do whatever is needed to defend the kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said Saudi Arabia is very worried that Iraq will use chemical weapons, 
as it has in the past against Iran and its own Kursih minority. 
</P>
<P>
At a summit meeting of the Arab League nations on Aug. 10, Egypt led the move 
to create a pan-Arab military force in the gulf region. Since then, diplomats 
say, Egypt has sent 4,000 to 5,000 commandos and paratroopers, and Morocco has 
sent 600 to 1,000 troops. Syria announced Tuesday that it has sent more than 
1,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two days, diplomatic sources said, Egypt has begun moving out a 
mechanized infantry division of 12,000 troops headed for Saudi Arabia. This 
force, along with light tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery, is 
traveling by air and sea. 
</P>
<P>
"They already had 4,000 troops there, and two days ago they started to send the 
mechanized division -- at what rate, I don't know," one diplomat said. "I 
understand they plan to send the entire division of 12,000 men." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency Reuters quoted a Western observer as saying the Egyptians had 
asked "friendly countries to help them move artillery and armor to the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
A military analyst said the Egyptians are taking their own tanks and artillery 
because "there's no way they are going to be integrated" with other units. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the invasion, about 1 million Egyptians were in Kuwait and Iraq, 
most of them working at menial jobs. They sent home about $1.2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government is clearly concerned about the loss of the money and 
the workers' safety.

Nestor Ilarde's tale of terror is emblazoned on his jacket: "Iraq War Victim." 
</P>
<P>
Ilarde, a 35-year-old Philippine mechanic working in Kuwait, was caught in the 
middle when Iraq invaded Aug. 2. He saw three Egyptian friends shot to death, 
he had to walk 12 miles across the blazing desert when his car gave out and he 
abandoned all he owned to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is lost," he said. "But I am alive." 
</P>
<P>
Ilarde and the 266 other Philippine workers from Kuwait who flew into Manila 
airport early today on a chartered jet from Saudi Arabia came back to a nation 
facing economic and political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the long reach of the Persian Gulf crisis, President Corazon 
Aquino's embattled government faces steeply higher prices for imported oil and 
the potential loss of its largest single source of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 Filipinos have been working in the Middle East, including an 
estimated 60,000 in Kuwait, 4,000 in Iraq and 374,000 in Saudi Arabia. They 
send home $1.3 billion a year through banks, and officials estimate that up to 
$3 billion a year comes back through unofficial channels. That makes labor the 
Philippines' most lucrative export. 
</P>
<P>
"We get hit on both sides," said Alex Magno, a political scientist at the 
Unviersity of the Philippines. "The price of oil goes up, and we lose 
remittances by our workers. The consequences are dire, both politically and 
economically." 
</P>
<P>
The political impact is evident in the rumors sweeping Manila that an impending 
oil price increase will spark another attempted right-wing military coup, which 
would be the seventh in four years. Last Friday, citing warnings of a coup, the 
armed forces went on red-alert status, the maximum state of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact is more certain, however. Officials said impending oil 
price increases would slow the economy and spark a spiral of rising prices for 
transport, labor, food and other necessities. Inflation, which reached 12.7% 
last quarter, is expected to hit 18%. The peso already has dropped to historic 
lows against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not only lose our oil and our workers in the gulf, we have to pay to 
bring them back," a Finance Department official said. "And while they're here, 
they're not doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has used chartered jets and scheduled airliners to 
evacuate about 1,240 Filipinos who escaped from Kuwait to Jordan and Saudi 
Arabia. Officials said they are considering sending ships to the region because 
evacuating everyone by air would cost more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has offered to hire up to 40,000 displaced Philippine workers, 
particularly trained technicians, doctors and nurses, according to Ruben 
Torres, secretary of labor. But he said only a few hundred of the 60,000 
Filipinos in Kuwait have managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
He said that about 4,000 have crowded into the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait and 
that about 13,000 have asked for travel documents. Food is being rationed, and 
chicken pox has broken out, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have to find ways to get food there," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 530 Filipinos are in Amman, the Jordanian capital, awaiting evacuation, 
according to Josefina Bilar, a Labor Department official. "We're trying our 
best to get them back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has not acknowledged using its giant military bases 
in the Philippines, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Station, for the Middle East 
mobilization. Aquino told reporters Monday she expects the United States to 
"consult" with her government before the bases are used. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanley Shrager, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said that under the 1988 
bilateral bases agreement, permission need only be sought for "combat military 
operations." And that, he said, is not likely, considering the distance to the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
He said Manila's permission is not necessary if the Pentagon uses the bases to 
resupply or refuel planes headed to the gulf, or to resupply, refuel and repair 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly conceivable, possible and probably probable," Shrager added. 
</P>
<P>
For now, attention is focused on the maids, cooks, mechanics and technicians 
who have come home with their lurid tales of robbery and rape, bravery and 
despair. The government has said it will file a formal protest with Iraq if the 
allegations of rape and other abuses can be substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
Marcello Costellas, a 39-year-old refinery worker, helped lead 62 people across 
the desert in two large dump trucks.

<P>
"At the border," he said, "the Iraqis met us with eight armored cars. After we 
talked, the officer said, 'OK, go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Salvacion Lazarte, 27, a maid, said she hid in her room for three days after 
hearing that other women had been raped by invading troops. She left everything 
when she escaped.

"We had to choose our lives or our things," she said.

KUWAIT CITY BECOMES LAWLESS JUNGLE WHERE DESPERATION RULES; 
</P>

OCCUPIED ZONE: FOOD SUPPLIES ARE DWINDLING, REFUGEES REPORT. LOOTING BY IRAQIS 
AND WORKERS CONTINUES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the heavy hand of the Iraqi invaders, Kuwait city is a lawless capital 
of increasing desperation, according to refugees who have reached the safety of 
Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the past week have Iraqi police officers been deployed on the city's 
streets, said one refugee who arrived in Bahrain over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few people are venturing out of their homes," he said. "The looting 
continues -- some by the Iraqis, some by Arab and Asian workers. They even hit 
the Pizza Hut." 
</P>
<P>
Food supplies are diminishing although most families stocked up in the first 
days after the Aug. 2 invasion, according to another refugee. Prices have 
soared in markets that still have anything to sell, and the price of bottled 
water is six times what it was before the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees' reports cannot be independently verified because phone lines to 
neighboring countries have been cut, and many would not be quoted by name for 
fear of reprisals against relatives left behind. But the evidence from the 
thousands who have fled Iraq and occupied Kuwait thus far paints a vivid 
picture of fear and chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"The street lights are not working," one refugee said in an interview in 
Bahrain, "and people are tearing around in their cars, making U-turns across 
traffic. It's mad, and there is no one to control it." 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of the exiled emir of Kuwait are posted on walls and power poles 
throughout the city, but so far there are none of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, the refugee said. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming other reports, he said groups of armed Palestinians have appeared in 
the streets, threatening the Kuwaitis. More than 400,000 Palestinians live and 
work in Kuwait, and there has been friction between the two groups for years -- 
a relationship of wealthy bosses and imported labor colored by antagonistic 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti resistance, the refugee said, appears to be limited to sniping, "but a 
Kuwaiti motorist will run down an Iraqi in the street if the opportunity 
presents itself." 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners trapped in Kuwait, no less than U.S. and other troops on the Saudi 
front, face the threat of an Iraqi poison-gas attack. 
</P>
<P>
But "if you think the Brits are just sitting around worrying, you're wrong," 
said Alan Lennox, a Scotsman who fled last week in a daring dash across the 
desert with 25 other Westerners in a nine-car convoy. "Hidey-holes and bomb 
shelters are being built with great inventiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Lennox, a professional diver who worked at an experimental fish farm in Kuwait 
for seven years, knows a bit about keeping things airtight. Bathrooms make the 
best shelters, he told a reporter, explaining that "there is no 
air-conditioning in the bathrooms in Kuwait, so that means gas wouldn't be 
pumped in." 
</P>
<P>
With a roll of sealing tape, the bearded Scotsman began turning his home into a 
fortress, making windows, fittings and cracks in the bathroom airtight. 
</P>
<P>
"The windows were boarded up with timber and sealed again with plastic bags," 
he said. "We cut strips of tape to the precise length of the door so we could 
dash in at a second's notice and seal ourselves in." 
</P>
<P>
Then he went to work on his emergency outfit: a wet suit for protection against 
chemicals, a face mask to shield the eyes and nose and a makeshift helmet -- a 
kitchen mixing bowl lined with foam padding. 
</P>
<P>
The bath was left half-filled for a quick chemical wash-off, and towels were 
handy for soaking as a head wrap. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur White, a British immunologist and transplant surgeon, reached 
Bahrain with his Korean wife, Son Young Choi, and a tale of terror. The couple 
lived near the main port of Kuwait, and they said the area soon was thick with 
Iraqi troops looking for food and water. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time they knocked," said Son Young Choi, a former Kuwait Airways 
stewardess, "I could see the soldiers' legs and guns through the bottom of the 
door, so I ran and hid under a mattress." 
</P>
<P>
But they came back, her husband said, this time with a captain, who entered the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me about my wife," White went on, "and said, 'I'll give you whiskey 
and beer for her.' I told him she was my wife, and he backed off." 
</P>
<P>
The couple tried to slip away one night but were stopped by a curfew officer 
and his patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"He became very intimidating and tried to drag my wife into a van," White said. 
"I knew what would happen if I let them take her, so I kept on talking to them, 
and she slipped away." 
</P>
<P>
Reunited, the couple said they broke into a nearby apartment and saw the Iraqis 
return, trying again to get into their home. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed behind an air-conditioning unit in a cupboard for four hours," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the law of the jungle," she recalled, stroking Nabia, her Siamese 
cat, who was brought across the desert on a leash so that she wouldn't jump out 
of the car. "Nabia is very happy to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
Scott White, Dr. White's 22-year-old son, had a tougher time of it than most of 
the foreigners who have made it across the border. When the Iraqis attacked, 
Scott White was in a Kuwaiti prison, halfway through a five-year sentence for 
possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
His fellow prisoners, White said, were terrified at the prospect of being 
turned over to the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
"We were negotiating with a captain to let us go, and the prisoners were going 
mad," he told a reporter. "There was a full-blown riot, and petrol (gasoline) 
bombs were being thrown. In the end, the guards couldn't control the prisoners 
and said we could go." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in prison denims, his head shaved prison-style, White ran through the 
streets to the home of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, the flight from Kuwait has been characterized by moments of 
panic and relief. American Martin Lerman, an interior designer, left Kuwait 
city in a convoy of cars guided by a man with a compass. Others have been led 
by a Bedouin farmer who knows the desert trails. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis were following us in tanks and armored personnel carriers," Lerman 
said. "They were watching every single thing we did. But they didn't stop us. 
It was as if they were trying to intimidate us to turn back. When we reached 
the border, it was all an anticlimax." 
</P>
<P>
Others told similar stories of high-speed races with Iraqi military vehicles. 
The soldiers were apparently under orders not to shoot but tried to overtake 
the convoys and cut them off. The refugees have concluded that a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle moving at top speed, with some of the air released 
from its tires for better traction, can outrun an Iraqi armored vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the desert roads are littered with abandoned cars, overheated or broken 
down, evidence that not everyone finished the race. And several shootings have 
been reported, including the documented case of a British citizen killed just 
north of the Saudi border. 
</P>
<P>
More frequent than the reports of shootings, however, are those of Iraqi troops 
waving a convoy through after a cursory check. In several incidents, refugees 
said the Iraqis asked forgiveness for invading Kuwait.

RESERVES CALL-UP DECISION DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PART OF THE REASON IS TO PREPARE THE 
PUBLIC FOR THE IMPACT.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the military pressing to call up reserves to support its massive Middle 
East deployment, Bush Administration officials said Tuesday a final decision 
has been delayed so that the Pentagon can match its vacancies with available 
military specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged, however, that the delay also reflects a desire to 
prepare for the expected public impact of a deployment expected to eventually 
send tens of thousands of reservists to active duty in the Persian Gulf region 
as well as within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's decision on the scope of the initial reserve call-up is 
expected to come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, meanwhile, reported that the United States has moved the 
equivalent of a small Midwestern city to the Middle East in the last 19 days -- 
complete with all of the necessary foodstuffs, vehicles and belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Gen. H.T. Johnson, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command and 
Military Airlift Command, said the massive movement of military personnel and 
equipment in less than three weeks is the largest operation of its kind in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the absence of a formal reserve call-up, he said, about 4,200 military 
reservists have volunteered to fly the 89 C-5s and 195 C-141s that are being 
used in the airlift. In addition, 17 commercial airliners and 21 civilian cargo 
planes have been pressed into service. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the significant volunteer effort, Johnson said the President would have 
to mobilize military reserve units because most volunteers could not be away 
from their jobs in private industry for more than 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials acknowledged that yanking neighborhood doctors and 
grocery clerks from their communities and sending them to war can be a 
wrenching experience, not just for the individuals and their communities but 
for the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
As part-time reservists are called up to become full-time soldiers, small towns 
and big cities alike will come to grips with the human dimensions of the crisis 
and the impact it can have across the continent, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the President's final decision has provided a welcome 
breathing space to allow the nation to become accustomed to the idea that the 
escalating crisis in the Middle East will involve a certain amount of personal 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's assistants have said the President was nearly certain as of last Friday 
that he would call up reserve units. Officials said the paper work to activate 
the reserves lacks only a presidential signature. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the Administration decided to delay the final step while complex 
preparations are still under way. The goal was to try to avoid confusion and 
minimize further delays once the decision is announced. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a lot of detail," one senior White House official said. "When it 
is signed, all these people are going to be told what is expected of them. You 
want them to be able to get a definite word one way or the other. You're 
dealing with people's lives and their employment." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, are set to meet with Bush today in Kennebunkport, Me. Among 
other things, they are expected to discuss the reserve call-up, White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said the White House wants to make 
sure that the activation order is able to match the right military personnel 
with the vacancies that need to be filled. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that as many as 150,000 reservists eventually could be 
called into active duty. Many would represent specialties, such as medicine and 
cargo handling, that are in short supply among active-duty forces. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, Gen. Johnson told a news briefing that the military, with help 
from reserve volunteers and the private sector, has transported the equivalent 
of Fayette, Ind., population 27,500, or Jefferson City, Mo., population 36,000, 
to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate we didn't have to fight our way in," Johnson said. "We've had 
no major surprises." 
</P>
<P>
He said the airlift initially strained the military's capacity as the United 
States hurried combat units to the Persian Gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait. But in recent days the operation has relied more on ship, which have 
spare capacity, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Most tanks and military vehicles have been rushed overseas aboard eight "fast 
sealift" ships capable of speeds up to 33 knots. The operation also involved 
unloading 12 Navy vessels pre-positioned in the Indian Ocean and stocked with 
ammunition, fuel, food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also has activated 38 ships from its "ready reserve fleet" and 
chartered 8 ships from commercial lines, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 billion pounds of material transported or still en route to the region is 
equal to all the cars, trucks, foodstuff, stocks, household goods and water 
supply of a small city, he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson declined to divulge the specific number of troops or military vehicles 
that have been put into place in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But he said 99% of all U.S. troops have been flown to the gulf in C-5 Galaxy 
and C-141 Starlifter transports. The trip takes 15 hours from the East Coast 
and about 20 hours from West Coast embarkation points. 
</P>
<P>
Participation by commercial air carriers began last Friday when Johnson 
activated a program known as the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the first time 
since its inception in 1951, at the time of the Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstenzang reported from Kennebunkport and Jackson from Washington.

FUTURE BEGINS NOW FOR JOE TORRE AND HIS CARDINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
The future begins now for the St. Louis Cardinals, as far as Manager Joe Torre 
is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have eight potential free agents and Torre will be exploring a 
number of options and sitting down high-priced veterans as the season winds 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see a mass exodus here," Torre said Tuesday. "I knew that coming in, 
but if all the main players decide to walk at least we got a peek instead of 
waiting till spring training to see what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
The first move was calling up outfielder Ray Lankford from Triple A Louisville 
Monday to replace injured Pedro Guerrero. Lankford will play regularly in 
center field, moving Willie McGee, one of the potential free agents, to right 
field for the first time in his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
Lankford, 23, was hitting .261 with 10 home runs, 72 RBIs and 28 stolen bases 
in his first season in Triple A. Lankford, who got his first start Tuesday 
night, has often been mentioned as the likely successor to McGee, who has 
played for Cardinals since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get a good read on what we can expect from him," Torre said. "The 
only way to do that is to really throw him out there." 
</P>
<P>
McGee is second in the National League in batting with a .339 average but has 
made a career-high 16 errors in center field. A few weeks ago he flung his 
glove into the stands after dropping a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
Torre expects McGee to make the adjustment to right. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good athlete, and he shouldn't have much problem," Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
While Guerrero is on the 15-day disabled list with a lower back injury, Torre 
also is moving rookie catcher Todd Zeile to first base and giving backup 
catcher Tom Pagnozzi a chance to play regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Todd Zeile. We know he's a catcher. I'm very impressed with his 
catching," Torre said. "He seems to need a little more work with the receiving 
and the throwing, but it's smooth." 
</P>
<P>
Pagnozzi, a backup the past four seasons, is hitting .266. 
</P>
<P>
The odd man out is Milt Thompson, who has recently pulled out of a season-long 
slump.

MELVIN DURSLAG: TV OR NFL: WHO MAKES THE CALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those making decisions for newspapers, radio and television have lived with the 
lingering migraine of what to do with gambling information in connection with 
sports coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In a country in which betting on games is not legal, for the most part, what 
posture is to be taken by the media in the offering of odds on the various 
events? 
</P>
<P>
Gamblers are a pain in the hip. You would like to transport all of them to 
Nevada and let them curl up in their own cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
But their legions about the land are so vast and the sums they bet so immense 
that those responsible for coverage must make troublesome decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Do they ignore odds, point spreads and the like because gambling, for the most 
part, isn't legal? 
</P>
<P>
Or, with exhausted resignation, do they conclude: "Look, either we move to 
Magic Mountain or face life as it is. Gambling is rampant at levels ranging 
from office bets to bookmaker accounts. Pool cards abound. Governors bet apples 
against country hams. We go with the flow."? 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, network television decided to go with the flow, enlisting a 
savant named Jimmy the Greek to impart betting information on upcoming football 
games. 
</P>
<P>
In his day, of course, Jimmy went broke betting, but his knowledge in the field 
was wide and, as our late colleague, Red Smith, used to say of experts: 
</P>
<P>
"An expert is a guy who was right once." 
</P>
<P>
But Jimmy ventured his opinions under wraps, avoiding odds and sizing up games 
in such gentle terms as "razor's edge," "slight favorite," "favorite," "heavy 
favorite" and "prohibitive favorite." 
</P>
<P>
He would be followed on TV by scholars quoting actual point spreads, leading to 
specialists advising viewers whether to take the points or spot them. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the National Football League chose to rise against this practice, 
specifying that networks and cable companies bidding for its games refrain from 
broadcasting gambling information. 
</P>
<P>
And, as you possibly read, this has led to the uncoupling by ESPN of Pete 
Axthelm, whose calling was to inform the faithful whether to take or spot. 
</P>
<P>
With this policy imposed by the NFL and accepted by those telecasting its 
games, we enter latitudes more sensitive than those related to gambling itself. 
</P>
<P>
Do you allow sports promoters to be editors? 
</P>
<P>
And, if so, do networks counter and tell promoters that in order for their 
games to be covered, they must outlaw blindside tackles, which are injurious to 
health? 
</P>
<P>
It occurred one day to late commissioner Bert Bell that he didn't want player 
fights to be seen on television. When a couple of guys started mixing it up, 
the camera would turn to the stands. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, promoters called the shots. An announcer at the Masters golf 
tournament referred to the crowd, almost playfully, as a "mob." 
</P>
<P>
CBS was informed sharply by the club president: "Galleries at Augusta National 
are not mobs." 
</P>
<P>
The announcer was kicked off the telecasting team. 
</P>
<P>
But, with time, the iron hand of the promoter would melt, yielding to 
conditions in which networks, independently, would assign announcers, who would 
report events as their judgment dictated. 
</P>
<P>
Only at local levels has broadcasting remained in the pocket of promoters. It 
was that way a half-century or more ago; it is that way today. Promoters 
control radio and TV of their events. 
</P>
<P>
And a serious effort to stop it never has been made. 
</P>
<P>
But at the national level, TV was recapturing its spring dignity when all of a 
sudden the NFL is heard from, telling networks they can't televise games if 
they permit talk about gambling. 
</P>
<P>
That call is the networks', not the NFL's, just as it is a newspaper's call on 
how to deal with odds. 
</P>
<P>
Some choose not to run odds. Others run them obscurely. Still others actually 
buy information from gambling services, offering betting data in great detail. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about its poaching on the news coverage process, the NFL has 
promised that having silenced TV talk on gambling, it will impose no further 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But most dangerous in any society is the guy who tastes blood. 
</P>
<P>
If the networks don't muster the courage to fight this, they will find before

RAIDERS GIVE BEUERLEIN THE OK TO SEEK A TRADE

Quarterback Steve Beuerlein, at a stalemate in contract negotiations, can do 
something about it -- for a price. 
</P>
<P>
"We have afforded him the opportunity to look for a trade," Raider owner Al 
Davis said Tuesday. "That was done 10 days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, who finished last season ahead of Jay Schroeder as the Raiders' 
starter, earned $140,000 and has rejected an offer of $500,000 from the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder makes in excess of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein confirmed that he received a Mailgram from the Raiders that gave him 
permission to seek a trade, but said that the Raiders are asking for too much 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't request a trade," Beuerlein said. "It was their idea, but they set 
the compensation very high, almost to a point were they know that there's no 
team that would probably buy on it. They want a player of commensurate ability, 
which is very vague, or a first-round draft choice or choices." 
</P>
<P>
With Beuerlein out of camp, Schroeder has regained the starting quarterback job 
but has been mostly unimpressive in three exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
Davis denied a report by sportscaster Fred Edelstein of ESPN that the Raiders 
will play in Oakland this season. Although Davis said he expects the team to 
remain in Los Angeles this season, he evaded questions on when he will decide 
between offers from Oakland and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfounded," Davis said of Edelstein's report. "It's erroneous. The only 
truth of his statement, which everyone knows, is that we have talked to Oakland 
and we are; and we have talked to Los Angeles, and we are. And we're 
negotiating with both." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Marcus Allen will be out a week to 10 days with a pulled right 
hamstring. He was injured in practice Tuesday. . . . Running back Steve 
Strachan, who asked to be released because the club is overstocked at the 
position, had his request granted Tuesday. A five-year veteran, Strachan rushed 
for 174 yards during his career with the Raiders.

DODGERS' DEMPSEY FINED, SUSPENDED FOR HIS PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey was fined $1,000 and given a one-day suspension, 
and the Philadelphia Phillies' Lenny Dykstra was fined $500 Tuesday for their 
roles in Monday's bench-clearing incident at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey, who hit Dykstra at home plate in the seventh inning of the Dodgers 2-1 
victory, has appealed the fine and suspension. 
</P>
<P>
If it is upheld, the penalty will amount to $3,777.78, with the loss of one 
day's pay for Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no interest in fighting, I did not provoke the fight," said Dempsey, who 
hit Dykstra with his gloved left hand after Dykstra dropped his bat and took a 
step toward Dempsey during an argument with umpire Ron Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
"If a man is coming at you, are you going to let him hit you first?" Dempsey 
said. "He was definitely coming at me. This is not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, said he thought Dykstra should have been 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he provoked it, didn't he?" Lasorda said. "If you are hitting a pack of 
dogs in a kennel and one of them comes out and bites you, who is at fault?" 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, however, said he supported National League President Bill White, who 
issued the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"What (White) is saying is, in essence, is that he will not tolerate fighting 
on the field, and I don't like to see it either," Lasorda said. "Here we are in 
a pennant race . . . I don't want to lose a player to injury because of a fight 
on the field."

CUTBACK MAY MEAN SCARCITY OF TROUT FOR SOUTHLAND ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Zupo says the good news is that trout fishing at Big Bear Lake should be 
red-hot right now. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that it won't be for long. Big Bear, along with all other 
Southern California fisheries, will be hit hard by a severe cutback in the 
state's trout planting program. 
</P>
<P>
Zupo is a fish culturist at the Mojave River state fish hatchery, which will be 
closed by Oct. 1, a victim of $12.6 million in cuts in the Department of Fish 
and Game's 1990-91 fiscal year budget mandated by the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts could be restored through legislative bail-out measures, but those -- 
if passed -- wouldn't kick in until mid-'91, and by then the Mojave River 
hatchery will be history. 
</P>
<P>
Mojave River, in Victorville, is the southernmost of the state's 13 rainbow 
trout hatcheries and the primary facility for stocking Southern California 
waters. No other trout hatchery will be closed -- and yet, Southern California 
is the largest area of the state with year-round trout fishing. 
</P>
<P>
There also are eight hatcheries for anadromous fish -- salmon and steelhead -- 
one for striped bass and one for catfish, the Imperial Valley Hatchery, that 
also will be closed. Imperial Valley's loss will hardly be felt. Predator birds 
got 95% of its production last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss of Mojave River means that Southern California's annual allotment 
of trout will be cut nearly in half, from 645,200 to 360,000 pounds. 
Thirty-five waters, nearly half of the 73 currently stocked, will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Mojave's loss will throw the burden onto the smaller Fillmore hatchery, which 
already is operating near capacity to serve waters in Santa Barbara and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Logistically, closing Mojave River seems to make little sense. Big Bear, the 
top trout fishery in Southern California, is about an 80-mile round trip by 
fish truck from Mojave River but a 250-mile round trip from Fillmore, an 
all-day haul. The supply lines for other fisheries also will be stretched, some 
beyond economic reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll be lucky if we get a plant once a month," said Lin Crawford, who 
runs a tackle store in Big Bear. "(It's) a matter of how many they can bring 
over from Fillmore." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Big Bear and other area fisheries can live it up. 
</P>
<P>
Don Von Allmen, manager of the Mojave River hatchery, said: "We'll be planting 
every week, and some of them will be planted more than once a week . . . 
sometimes more than once a day. We've got a short time to get rid of 200,000 
pounds of fish." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the hatchery plants 10,000 pounds a week. Now they're unloading 
50,000 pounds a week to empty the ponds by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are two problems: Some of the waters are too warm for planting 
trout -- 75 degrees at the surface temperature is the usual limit -- and many 
of the planted fish are under legal size. There isn't time to let them grow, 
and their small size makes them easy pickings for predator fish, such as 
striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
"The low elevation waters we usually hit during the winter months," Von Allmen 
said. "But if the water's deep enough that there's some cool water down there, 
we can get away with it. The ones that are suitable to plant will get a lot 
more fish than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will be sub-catchables, some fingerlings. We'll have to put the small 
fish where they'll have a good food supply and won't be noticed so much and 
will have a better chance (to survive)." 
</P>
<P>
The legislative mandate called for $1.8 million in cuts for the DFG's Inland 
Fisheries Division. Sacrificing the two hatcheries will save $1.2 million, but 
Von Allmen says he isn't sure why Mojave River was picked. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I've ever been given is they save a big lump sum of money by 
closing this place," he said. "It's still probably the most expensive hatchery 
to run. But we were always among the lowest in cost per pound." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Hashagen, the DFG's hatchery coordinator in Sacramento, said: "The primary 
reason is that we've had some disease problems there in the past, (and) it is a 
hatchery that pumps its water supply and the water supply costs us about 
$300,000 a year. A lot of our other (hatchery) waters are gravity supply or 
spring supply. 
</P>
<P>
"And, in reality, it was an exercise that was done in haste, as many of our 
exercises up here are during the legislative season. (But) I think if we had 
taken time to sit down and look at all our hatcheries, that one probably would 
still have been high on the list. Whether it would have been the one picked, I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The disease was redmouth, a stress-related affliction that hit the Mojave River 
hatchery in October, affecting about 10% of the fish. It has since been 
eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Chen, a DFG fish pathologist for the Southern California hatcheries, 
said: "It's too bad they're closing it now because we're in the best shape 
we've ever been for numbers and the health of our fish. Before the dump started 
two weeks ago, we were crammed full of healthy fish." 
</P>
<P>
One problem at Mojave River is bird predation. Night herons take 30%-40% of the 
production, leaving about 500,000 pounds a year to plant. Nets would keep birds 
out of the six 1,000-foot raceways, encompassing 60 ponds, but nets would cost 
$200,000-$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Von Allmen said: "This place always could have raised 600,000 pounds, but the 
first part of the '80s they wanted to hold down production for cost savings. 
The second half, when they wanted more production and bigger fish, we had the 
problem with bird predation." 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore has only 40 ponds but it has bird netting, and, with additional 
staffing, will try to increase its production. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get a lot of our hatcheries bird-caged," Hashagen said. "Where we 
have done it, it has been very successful. The hatchery system also could use 
more money to modernize their trucks, improve their housing, put bird cages 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Such improvements would be cost-effective, but the DFG lacks the capital. 
Worse, the cutbacks could be counter-productive economically if fishing license 
sales fall off with reduced angling opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody involved is happy about the situation. It will affect several lives. 
</P>
<P>
Von Allmen has been with the DFG for 35 years and the manager at Mojave River 
for 19. He doesn't know where he will be after Oct. 1, but he probably will 
stay with the department. The DFG has 160 vacant positions overall. One is at 
Mojave River, which has six employees. 
</P>
<P>
Hashagen said: "We will be able to place all of our people with no problem. 
Unfortunately, it uproots them from family and friends. But hatchery folks are 
used to moving around." 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Big Bear may feel it at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"(Fishing) pumps a lot of money into this little valley," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows whether Mojave will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the money right now," Hashagen said. "So there will be some fish 
next year (from Fillmore), but unless we can get our feet back under us, things 
are going to be tough for recreation down there."

A former Notre Dame lineman, Steve Huffman, claims in a magazine report that 
there was widespread steroid use on the football team and that Coach Lou Holtz 
"had to have known" about it. 
</P>
<P>
In this week's issue of Sports Illustrated, Huffman alleges that "almost half 
the lettermen at Notre Dame used steroids at some time." 
</P>
<P>
He also claims that some players sold the muscle-building drug, which is banned 
by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame officials denied Huffman's charges in a written statement issued by 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who had an injury-plagued career at Notre Dame before quitting the 
team during preseason practice in 1987, said two assistant coaches suggested 
that he take steroids to increase his strength. He did not name the coaches or 
any of the players who allegedly used steroids.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE COSTS AND DIVIDENDS OF KEEPING PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the crisis deepens and we look to be tied down in the Persian Gulf for more 
than a few weeks, it's time to start calculating the cost to the American 
taxpayers -- and to ask what they're getting for their money. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that the cost may be less than gloomy predictions are saying, and 
the payoff will be in more than oil. The great multinational military 
expedition against Iraq may involve what the experts call "oil geopolitics." 
But lots of other things are involved, too: the balance of power in the Middle 
East, the safety of countries in the region, the world economy and world 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Beside such grand purposes, the immediate cost estimates seem small. Defense 
Department and military analysts say the Gulf buildup will cost $6 billion to 
perhaps $12 billion a year, which is not such a big number in a $300-billion 
defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
The larger costs have been paid: The tens of billions of dollars worth of ships 
and planes in the Persian Gulf, and the sophisticated radar and firepower, are 
all part of the $8 trillion (in current dollars) that the United States has 
spent over four decades to "maintain peace and stability in the world," says 
Lawrence Korb, former assistant secretary of defense and now a scholar at the 
Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a shooting war could destroy a lot of that equipment and be 
extremely expensive. And even without shooting, the Gulf expedition will 
diminish the peace dividend from the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
But predictions that it will throw the U.S. economy into recession could be off 
the mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Guns come at the expense of butter -- provided you have the butter," remarks 
Albert Wojnilower, senior economist of First Boston Corp. He means that if the 
economy is already running in high gear, with no spare capacity, the extra cost 
of a military venture comes at the expense of the civilian economy. But if the 
civilian economy is sluggish, as is the case today, a military buildup can 
provide acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
So in the short term, neither cash outlays for the Gulf nor its economic 
effects look that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Longer term, the surprising prediction is that U.S. forces will be in the Gulf 
for years. For even if Saddam Hussein is killed or removed from power, Middle 
East experts say, Iraq's military power will continue to dominate the oil-rich 
countries of the Gulf. So Korb and others predict that the United States will 
keep a military presence to maintain stability -- as it did for decades in West 
Germany and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Behind such predictions is the fact that the stakes in the Middle East go far 
beyond oil. To be sure, maintaining a stable flow of oil, the biggest energy 
source for the world's economies, is important. But ownership of the oil hasn't 
mattered much in traditional military thinking. Remarking years ago on Saudi 
Arabia's vulnerability to attack, a U.S. Army officer at the Pentagon put it 
this way: "'The only reason someone seizes an oil field is to pump oil and sell 
it to get money. Well, we're a customer for oil." 
</P>
<P>
But when Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, the U.S. response was not so casual. 
Why? One reason was that Hussein threatened also to take Saudi Arabia and thus 
a monopolist's control of 25% of the world's current oil production and more 
than half the world's reserves. 
</P>
<P>
There were more important reasons as well. "We didn't want the Iraqis to get 
too rich," says William Niskanen, a member of the council of economic advisers 
in the Reagan Administration and now chairman of Washington's Cato Institute. 
He means that the United States didn't want Hussein to grow in power and to 
pursue his intent to build nuclear weapons. A nuclear Iraq would have 
threatened Israel, which is acknowledged to have nuclear weapons, and a nuclear 
war could have begun. 
</P>
<P>
So the United States as world leader led a military expedition to preserve the 
peace. "It's for the public good," says Niskanen, because Hussein's violation 
of the principle of national sovereignty threatened many nations. 
</P>
<P>
Which is noble, but brings us back to the question: How much does world 
leadership cost U.S. taxpayers and what do they get for their money? The direct 
cash cost might be the $300-billion U.S. defense budget. The payoff is in a 
relatively peaceful world in which many economies can raise their living 
standards and the world's largest economy can enjoy the highest living standard 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
Other nations share the payoff; do they also share the cost? Yes and no. In the 
past decade, foreign buying of U.S. government bonds, which helped fund the 
federal deficit, was said to allow Americans to "live beyond their means." But 
those foreign investors got a cash return on their money and, as their 
investment financed the U.S. military buildup that now protects the Persian 
Gulf, they got a payoff in security as well. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that after the present Iraqi crisis is over, the United States may 
have 50,000 troops stationed long term in Saudi Arabia to maintain stability in 
the region. Paying for those troops should be the oil-rich states of the Middle 
East (it would take $7 billion a year to quarter 50,000 troops, according to 
Pentagon calculations in the current crisis), as Germany and Japan have helped 
pay for the stationing of U.S. troops since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
That way U.S. taxpayers can have financial partners as well as military allies 
in defense of world peace.

Circle K Closing 201 Stores: The Circle K convenience store chain said it has 
begun closing 201 unprofitable stores and will complete the job by the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to help turn around the Phoenix-based company, which in 
May filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law. Thirteen stores will be closed in Southern California, all in San Diego, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Another 16 stores will be closed in 
Central and Northern California. Circle K now has about 550 stores in 
California, including 87 in Los Angeles.

PARSONS SEEKING TO CONTACT KUWAITI EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From offices in Saudi Arabia, Washington and Pasadena, Parsons Corp. has won 
engineering contracts worth billions of dollars from governments in the 
Mideast. Now, as the risk of doing business there has become painfully 
apparent, the company is engaged in a frustrating bid to monitor the safety of 
its employees trapped in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and to gain their release. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, like other U.S. firms with Kuwaiti operations, is finding that it can 
do little. Still, it tries mightily to do something -- and to keep families 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena-based engineering and construction firm has about 100 employees in 
the oil-rich emirate at the head of the Persian Gulf. About half are Kuwaiti 
nationals and the rest are Europeans and North Americans. There are 12 U.S. 
citizens, along with their eight dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to reach Parsons' employees in Kuwait began immediately after Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the invasion, the State Department accounted for all Parsons 
employees, declaring them in no immediate danger. Parsons business offices 
elsewhere in the Middle East corroborated the State Department report after 
talking with some employees by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, Parsons President Ray W. Judson said the company "will do 
everything we can to assist our employees in leaving the country of Kuwait 
safely." 
</P>
<P>
However, Parsons, which has had operations in Kuwait for 30 years, has been 
unable to make direct contact with its employees since Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Iraqi government ordered Kuwaiti-based citizens of Western 
countries opposing Iraq militarily to report to authorities at three hotels in 
Kuwait. An estimated 2,500 Americans are in Kuwait, most of them employees of 
private companies and their dependents. Most are believed to have ignored the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
However, some Americans and other Westerners have reportedly been detained and 
taken to strategic civil and military sites as human shields against possible 
U.S. attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"This heightens our concern for our people (in Kuwait)," said Parsons 
spokeswoman Debra Williams. "At this point, any communication is critical, 
because we've not heard from our people (since Aug. 2). Now that the situation 
is deteriorating, there is even more concern." 
</P>
<P>
Communications have been hampered because telephone lines in Kuwait have been 
damaged, destroyed or overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, one of about 60 U.S. firms with operations in Kuwait, was designing 
and supervising construction of highway systems there. Some employees had 
helped with construction of an oil-fired power plant and were designing a 
waste-water treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
If Parsons contacts any staff in Kuwait, the firm will seek information on the 
condition and location of other employees and dependents. However, Parsons 
isn't likely to have much useful advice; Iraqis have closed Kuwait's airports 
and are not allowing Americans to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We're relying on the State Department and the government to look out for the 
well-being of employees," Williams said. "We'll do anything to help, but the 
opportunity has to be there -- and it's just not there." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the State Department has supplied periodic reports on the status 
of employees -- informing the company last week, for example, that some 
individuals were known to be unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department is using the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and sources in the 
region to maintain contact with corporate employees there, said department 
spokesman David Good. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Iraq has tightened its grip on foreigners -- on Monday ordering 
embassies in Kuwait to close by Friday or run the risk that diplomats will be 
treated as "ordinary foreign nationals," making them liable to be rounded up. 
The U.S. Embassy plans to ignore the Iraqi demand and continue efforts to 
maintain contacts with American citizens, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
Good said the State Department is advising U.S. citizens in Kuwait not to 
report to Iraqi authorities at designated hotels "because their position 
afterwards would be uncertain." He also said the State Department is urging 
employees of U.S. firms in Kuwait to "remain at their homes," to stay away from 
their corporate offices and to "keep a low profile."

TRUCKING, BUS COMPANIES MOVE TO RAISE RATES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: REGULATORS EASE RULES ON PRICE HIKE NOTIFICATION TO LESSEN THE 
IMPACT OF HIGHER FUEL COSTS AFTER THE INVASION OF KUWAIT. 
</P>

<P>
Some of the nation's largest bus lines and trucking companies are raising bus 
fares and shipping rates to help cover the sharp jump in fuel prices that has 
followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said many smaller firms also probably will raise their prices if oil 
costs continue their dramatic march upward. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Interstate Commerce Commission took an unusual step to help 
trucking companies respond to higher fuel costs. The ICC said truckers can now 
raise rates on one day's notice instead of the seven days' advance notification 
to customers usually required. 
</P>
<P>
The trucking industry argued that it needed more freedom to adjust rates 
because fuel costs are changing so rapidly. Diesel prices have risen 30% since 
the end of July, according to some industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that trucking firms have raised their rates 
to cover fuel costs. In January, they raised rates in response to higher prices 
caused by a prolonged cold snap in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Most trucking executives said their customers were willing to pay the 
additional freight charges, even though the nation's largest trucking firms 
imposed a 5% rate increase in June. "They are just passing it on to the 
consumer," said Jerry Moyes, owner of Swift Transportation in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking industry executives and analysts said the shipping rate hikes will 
probably be passed on to consumers, but the impact should be small. Kenneth D. 
Simonson, an economist with the American Trucking Assn., said shipping costs 
contribute less than 1% to an item's retail price. The fuel surcharges imposed 
by trucking firms range between 1% and 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers probably will notice the fare hikes by the nation's bus lines and 
airlines. Greyhound Lines and Trailways Lines last week raised fares 2%, or an 
average of 60 to 70 cents a ticket, and a spokeswoman for the two bus lines 
said fares may go higher. "It is a situation we monitor daily," said 
spokeswoman Liz Dunn. "We cannot continue to absorb increased fuel costs." 
</P>
<P>
Some smaller bus lines, such as Airport Cruiser, can't easily raise fares 
because they are locked into contracts with tour operators that were negotiated 
months ago. "Fuel prices have risen outrageously, and we haven't been able to 
raise prices," said Debra Mintz, owner of Airport Cruiser, based in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said the summer is normally the most profitable season for her company, 
which transports tourists from Los Angeles International Airport to hotels near 
Disneyland. "We normally make enough in the summer to hang on through the 
winter," she said, but with the fuel hikes "our profit level is dipping really 
low." 
</P>
<P>
The airlines have announced fuel-related fare hikes. Major U.S. carriers, 
except Trans World Airlines, had said they planned to raise domestic fares 5.3% 
Thursday, but that may change. TWA said Tuesday that it plans to put the same 
fare increase into effect Aug. 30, and it appeared probable that the other 
airlines might postpone their fare increase until then.

USAir Announces More Layoffs: The nation's seventh-largest airline, which last 
week announced the layoff of 200 pilots, said it was cutting another 1,500 
workers, or 2.7% of its work force, as it pares back expansion plans. The 
Arlington, Va.-based airline said most of the 1,500 employees have been hired 
recently as part of an expansion program that is being rolled back.

Oil Barons Top Rich List: The two richest people on the face of the earth are 
oil barons, according to Fortune magazine. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, 
oil-rich leader of the tiny Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top 
title for the fourth straight year, with an estimated worth of $25 billion, 
unchanged from 1989. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian 
Gulf crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged.

Some Manville Lawyers' Fees Capped: U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, 
supervising an overhaul of the Manville trust fund, for the first time limited 
fees to plaintiffs' lawyers for settling claims involving asbestos-related 
diseases. Weinstein, who has ordered an overhaul of the cash-strapped trust, 
limited the amount lawyers can charge clients to 20% of settlements in 
emergency cases. Under the ruling, for settlements paid out over time, the 20% 
fee limit may be collected only as each payment is received so that victims 
always receive 80% of each check.

STUDY: 'BRAND IMAGES' NEED NURTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlboro has done a bang-up job, but Coca-Cola almost blew it. AT&amp;T is 
right on target but Sears may have lost it. 
</P>
<P>
Although America's biggest companies are spending tens of billions of dollars 
each year to create and nurture their brand images, most are going about it the 
wrong way. That is the conclusion of a five-year consumer study to be unveiled 
in New York today by the ad agency N W Ayer Inc. In the 1990s, the study warns, 
marketers are running the risk of losing touch with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: Most companies still don't know how to reach consumers through 
their brands. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, "brand image" consists of the qualities that consumers 
associate with a brand and the emotional reaction that those qualities produce. 
A favorable reaction can often result in a decision to buy one product over 
another. Marlboro's macho cowboy and AT&amp;T's image of reliability have long 
succeeded in luring customers. But marketing experts say consumers can be 
easily confused over what a brand stands for, such as when Coke introduced its 
new formula or when Sears suddenly announced a policy of everyday low prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Brands have to become much more human so that people can relate to them in a 
human way," said Fred Posner, an Ayer executive vice president who oversaw the 
study. "You need a personality and a consistency. But you can't just claim in 
your advertising that you have a personality." That personality, he said, has 
to be consistent in the product -- as well as its packaging, pricing and 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will be a period of searching for identity in an increasingly 
confused and chaotic world," said Posner. 
</P>
<P>
In just one hour of watching television, the typical consumer sees about 30 
different commercials -- most of which are 15 or 30 seconds long. On a daily 
basis, the average consumer is bombarded with an estimated 3,000 commercial 
messages -- ranging from billboards to radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, a growing number of companies are investing less 
money to strengthen their brands. Today, most firms spend nearly twice as much 
on fast-sale promotions than they spend on brand image advertising. Just 20 
years ago, those figures were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a short-term focus on quarterly profits," said Posner. But 
establishing a brand's image "is not done in a quarter. It takes careful, 
methodical support." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Ayer has always excelled at creating successful brand 
images for its clients. During the past two years, it lost such major clients 
as Burger King and Continental Airlines, which have struggled for years to 
develop clear brand images. But Ayer has seen some recent success in improving 
images for its huge retail client, J. C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies have more carefully nurtured the brand image for a product than 
Brown-Forman Beverage Co., which makes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Jack 
Daniel's has not strayed one iota from its folksy print campaign for the past 
36 years. 
</P>
<P>
That laid-back image has been created through a long-running series of 
black-and-white print advertisements. The ads are always informal photographs 
of people who work at the company's lone distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn. The 
only sign of the whiskey is a tiny picture of it buried at the bottom of each 
ad. "Without a brand image, you can't expect to have any long-term success," 
said Rick Cahill, senior brand manager for Jack Daniel's. "I attribute all of 
the success of the brand to its image."

PASADENA STAR-NEWS SOLD TO UNIT OF CANADIAN CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A subsidiary of the Toronto-based Thomson Newspaper Group has purchased the 
majority interest in the 43,000-circulation Pasadena Star-News, a daily 
newspaper covering the western San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomson-owned San Gabriel Valley Tribune Inc. announced that it acquired 
the controlling interest by purchasing Star-News common stock previously owned 
by Texas media mogul William Dean Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton retains a minority interest, according to F. Al Totter, president of 
San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
The management company has overseen business operations of both newspapers for 
more than a year. Early this month, the company named a single editor to 
coordinate news coverage of the Star-News, the San Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune 
and the Whittier Daily News, also owned by Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Totter would not disclose the terms of the sale nor would he say 
what percentage of stock was sold. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, whose MediaNews Group owns the Houston Post, the Denver Post and 
dozens of other newspapers in nine states, bought the Star-News for $55 million 
from the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain in June 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Only months before the deal, he had said that even $50 million was too much to 
pay for the 103-year-old Star-News. Singleton later denied reports that he was 
acting as an agent for Thomson. But on several occasions, Singleton has sold 
newspapers to Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper industry observers have said that Knight-Ridder, a widely respected 
chain with papers including the Miami Herald and the Philadelphia Inquirer, did 
not want to sell the Pasadena newspaper to a foreign company. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, one month after Singleton bought the Star-News, he announced that 
the newspaper would enter into a joint venture with the West Covina-based San 
Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Under that agreement, the two major suburban newspapers of the San Gabriel 
Valley announced that they were combining key parts of their business 
operations. Since then, the newspapers have increasingly pooled resources in 
their editorial products, with the same stories and photographs often appearing 
in both papers. 
</P>
<P>
With the purchase the majority of Singleton's stock, Thomson has a 
three-newspaper domain in Los Angeles County, with combined total circulation 
of 124,000. Of this number, the Tribune accounts for 63,000 and the Whittier 
Daily News, 18,000. Thomson is one of the largest newspaper companies in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper industry analysts widely believe that Singleton is highly leveraged 
and needs to reduce his debt, and the sale of some Star-News stock probably 
would serve that need. Singleton could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Totter said, "It's a pretty straightforward situation of a purchase of stock." 
</P>
<P>
Tribune managing editor George Pinkerton was named to coordinate news coverage 
at the three papers, with one of his duties to eliminate overlap, Totter said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sale would bring no significant changes other than a joint 
marketing campaign. Already, he said, the management company has overseen 
installation of new computer equipment at the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Totter would not say whether there would be layoffs or additions to staff. He 
said the company would "just let the market drive it." 
</P>
<P>
Totter said fears of the Star-News being subsumed by the Tribune are unfounded. 
"We feel that each publication has to be autonomous," he said.

Washington.

FIRMS PLAN STANDARD UNIX SYSTEM FOR PCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three software companies announced plans to develop a standard version of the 
Unix operating system for IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz Operation Inc. said it will work with American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. and Intel Corp. on the software project that would give PC users 
an alternative to the traditional MS-DOS and OS/2 computer operating systems 
used in personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp., 
Compaq Computer Corp. and others. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts see the agreement as a potential blow to Redmond, Wash.-based 
Microsoft, which sells the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems for IBM and 
compatible personal computers.

MCI WILL SPEND $1 BILLION TO GO ALL-DIGITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
MCI Communications Corp. said Tuesday that it would invest about $1.1 billion 
to transform its telephone network into a fully digital system to improve 
efficiency and profit, leading to a writeoff of $500 million to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance telephone company, said the 
charge could occur in the current quarter. It expects the new network to be in 
place by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement sparked a selloff in the company's stock. MCI fell $1.125 to 
$33.625 a share on the over-the-counter market, where it was the most active 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based telecommunications company said its plan includes sharing 
telephone networks with Williams Telecommunications Group, a unit of Tulsa, 
Okla.-based Williams Cos. Each company will have access to the other's network. 
Terms of that agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
MCI also said it would integrate 3,000 miles of optical fiber network acquired 
in its recent merger with Telecom U.S.A. and an investment of about $1.1 
billion next year to modernize its network. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its modernization plan, MCI said it was "considering a writedown of 
antiquated" analog equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Digital technology permits clearer and faster voice and data transmissions. It 
is based on a stream of pulsed codes that are regenerated at the receiving end. 
Unlike analog transmissions, digital signals do not get weaker as they get 
farther from the originating point. 
</P>
<P>
MCI's plan follows its acquisition of rival Telecom for $1.25 billion, which 
will increase its long-distance market share to about 15% from 12.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been steadily chipping away at American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co.'s commanding 68.7% share of the market since the giant's monopoly 
was broken in 1984. MCI was founded in 1968, but it did not become profitable 
until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company's plans to modernize its network could result in a 
third-quarter loss, but they expect the new system to eventually improve 
efficiency and profit. 
</P>
<P>
"MCI's planned improvements imply the need to make some upgrades to respond to 
the competitive pressures of the business," said New Japan Securities analyst 
David Boczar. 
</P>
<P>
"The move will be positive over the long term, allowing MCI to control costs 
more efficiently and offer new services," Boczar said. 
</P>
<P>
Several industry analysts said they were cutting their third-quarter and 
full-year earnings estimates for MCI. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Sawers, an analyst with C. Bernstein, said the writeoff will result in a 
third-quarter loss of about 50 cents a share. But he said he still expects the 
company to earn 75 cents a share in operating earnings in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
MCI earned 62 cents a share in the year-ago third quarter.

ONETIME RESORT BECOMES HOME TO SCIENTISTS, ARTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORHOODS: PEOPLE CAME TO NORTHEAST ALTADENA FOR THE MOUNTAINS. THEY STAYED 
BECAUSE OF THE FRIENDLINESS OF ITS RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORETTA SCHERTZ KELLER, Keller is The Times' community correspondent for 
Altadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1907, the first merchant to open for business in Northeast Altadena was 
picketed for several days by homeowners indignant at the idea of a grocery 
store in their rustic neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the shops and eateries on the site of that original venture on 
North Lake Avenue, the Model Grocery Co., seem to receive a warmer reception 
from residents, who treat them as a folksy community hub. 
</P>
<P>
At the Park Bench Deli, despite the distracting aromas when co-owner Tudor 
Lance cooks corned beef, members of the nearby Theosophical Society can be 
heard talking philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally, Lance's 10-year-old daughter, Elisabeth, visits with diners 
in their booths. "I want people to feel at home here," Lance said. 
</P>
<P>
Down at the Fox's Restaurant, meanwhile, the interplay between waitresses and 
customers touches on topics ranging from hairdos to basketball. The coffee 
shop's homespun decor includes wooden plaques inscribed with words of wisdom 
such as, The flavor of onions is improved by adding steak. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Lorraine and Ken Bertonneau have lived in the neighborhood for years. 
"We looked extensively in other areas, and concluded that everything we want is 
right here: peace and quiet, friendliness and wonderful neighbors, but mainly 
-- the mountains," Lorraine Bertonneau said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Mountains loom above Altadena, an 8.8-square-mile 
unincorporated county area with about 40,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Northeast Altadena, with an estimated 7,328 residents, was once called 
"Altadena Heights." 
</P>
<P>
Historians say it became a verdant mountain resort before the turn of the 
century, when wealthy people from Canada and the East Coast built winter homes, 
enjoying golf at the Altadena Country Club, just south of Mendocino Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodbury Brothers -- John and Frederick, of Marshalltown, Iowa -- could be 
considered Altadena's town fathers. In 1880, they acquired more than 900 acres 
of what was then considered wasteland at the north end of Rancho San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodbury subdivision was laid out in 1887 by the Pasadena Improvement Co. A 
portion of it extended past Lake Avenue into Northeast Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Eastward, in the central section, Lafayette S. Porter, a Chicago banker, and 
his mother, Hannah H. Porter, bought two adjoining parcels of land in 1883. 
When Porter sold the property in 1912, his home, at 2672 Porter Ave., was 
razed. Later, Edward Munroe built a two-story stucco house on the site. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, according to Altadena Heritage chairman Tim Gregory, Boulder Road 
was developed as a single tract. By this time, Altadena was attracting 
scientists, professionals and more than a sprinkling of artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
The short, boulder-lined street of about 30 homes drew such a disproportionate 
share of creative people that it's considered a neighborhood unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most noted of its residents was the late Richard P. Feynman, the 
iconoclastic Nobel Prize-winning physicist from Caltech. Feynman, who was also 
an artist and writer, died in 1988, and his wife, Gwyneth, died in January. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's two-story, Spanish-style home is now owned by their two children, 
Carl, 28, and Michelle, 21, a photography student at the Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena. Both were raised in the house, and Michelle Feynman, who 
still occupies it, says she intends to stay. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote about the house in a book of home photos she compiled: 
</P>
<P>
"Following my mother's death, I came to realize that I still have a parent of 
sorts. This house, made of wood and stone and metal, has a spirit. . . . It is 
no longer just a house." 
</P>
<P>
Up the street, past a couple of small adobe houses amid other grand homes, 
boulders are used architecturally as part of the base of an English Tudor house 
with dormer windows. 
</P>
<P>
Built as a fishing retreat in 1920 by Thelma and Howard Edgcomb, it was the 
first house on the street. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the house, a small stream was created and stocked with fish. 
</P>
<P>
Its current owner is a Pasadena art dealer. To reach the front door, a visitor 
must step up and down large rocks and cross a small, ivy-covered bridge. The 
bridge spans the pool of a fountain that flows among flowers and pebbles. 
</P>
<P>
Lillias Jones, 70, a former actress, gives voice lessons in the 40-foot living 
room of a 4,000-square-foot Mediterranean house next door. She's also honorary 
secretary of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society and allows members to play her 
two baby grand pianos when they meet there. 
</P>
<P>
Northeast Altadena's easternmost tract extended from Allen Avenue to Eaton 
Canyon. It was bought by William Allen in 1879, after he came to America from 
England. He named it the Sphinx Ranch. (He had spent 23 years in Egypt, as a 
broker.) 
</P>
<P>
Allen paid $7.50 an acre for the 502-acre ranch. In 1925, subdivisions were 
sold to real estate agents for $1,800 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
At Allen Avenue and Mendocino Street stands the imposing Balian House, owned by 
George Balian, an ice cream manufacturer. Each Christmas, he decorates the 
exterior of the Mediterranean mansion with what appears to be millions of 
lights, an attraction for visitors on tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton Canyon, with its waterfalls and gaping gorges, defines the area's eastern 
boundary. Naturalist John Muir daringly inched his way up to the peak that now 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Northeast residents take their pleasure in more sedate ways, enjoying 
their neighborhood -- and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what the world should be," said deli co-owner Lance. "It's integrated, 
and people live together nicely."

YOUTH FIRE CREWS: BAD BOYS TURN HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wade Hamel gives chain saws to teen-age criminals. 
</P>
<P>
And he's proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel, director of Camp Joseph M. Paige in La Verne, puts young felons and 
hard-core gang members to work clearing brush to aid Los Angeles County 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, one of two associated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, is 
home to 116 boys ages 16 to 18, most of whom have been convicted of serious 
crimes -- just about everything short of murder. 
</P>
<P>
This summer and fall, with the drought pushing the danger of fire to a critical 
point, youths from Camp Paige and from Camp Louis Routh, in Tujunga, are on 
alert 24 hours a day to fight fires all over Los Angeles County. They work side 
by side with firefighters and adult prison inmates, performing the backbreaking 
job of clearing tinder-dry brush out of the path of the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"The community feels very angry at juveniles when they hear of them committing 
crimes," Hamel said. "But when we take these boys out to do fire suppression, 
the community looks on them as heroes. Probably this is the first time in their 
lives they've had the opportunity to be looked up to for something real they've 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The firefighting experience also has been known to spark a little attitude 
adjustment on the part of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
County firefighter Joe Alvarado tells the story of driving his red crew truck 
out to the scene of a brush fire in Webb Canyon in June and seeing a sight he 
never expected. 
</P>
<P>
As he prepared to face the leaping flames, thick black smoke and rain of ashes, 
Alvarado glanced into the glass-enclosed passenger section of his truck and saw 
nine juvenile delinquents huddled together in frightened prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Some had not thought twice before of wielding weapons, stealing cars or 
invading private homes. Now, stripped of their macho veneer by the heat of the 
flames, these former property-destroyers were protecting the possessions of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allowed interviews with some of the youthful firefighters on the 
condition that their last names not be used. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, David M., a 17-year-old who landed at Camp Paige after he was 
caught burglarizing cars and ditching school, worked on the fire lines for 12 
hours during the June 28 Webb Canyon fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exhausting," David said. "But it gets your adrenaline going. The day 
moves by quick." 
</P>
<P>
The boys used chain saws, rakes and hoes to slash through the yucca plants, 
manzanita bushes and poison oak plants that fuel a fire. The dirt paths, or 
fire lines, act as breaks to stop a blaze from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are minors, the boys cannot normally work more than eight hours at 
a stretch, but in emergencies they are called on to work 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
They continued cutting back chaparral into the night, and the flames gradually 
receded and the sparks died down. "We give them a lot of responsibility and 
they kind of rise to the occasion," Alvarado said. "There's really no other 
choice in a fire situation." 
</P>
<P>
As the night turned into morning, a nearby homeowner came out to survey the 
damage and express thanks that his home had been saved. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they saw a grateful family there, they were the proudest, happiest kids 
alive," Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
But along the way the youthful offenders faced real danger. 
</P>
<P>
During a fire in late June, a 23-year-old inmate from the Bautista Conservation 
Camp in Hemet was killed when a 17-member fire crew was overrun by flames. 
Victor Ferrera was serving time for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Four youths and their fire captain were killed during a Puente Hills fire in 
September, 1955, probation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel said there have been no serious incidents involving youths since then, 
but he added that it is always hazardous on the fire lines, especially for the 
youths who are specially trained to use chain saws to mow down large brush. All 
of the boys wear protective gear, carry food, water and special fire tents, and 
must pass 80 hours of rigorous physical and academic training before they are 
placed on fire crews. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel said that a selected group of the boys who have been evaluated according 
to their previous criminal records, their histories of violence and their 
personal suitability are assigned to operate the chain saws. "After they've 
been in camp quite a few weeks, we know the boy and how he handles himself, 
what kind of maturity level he has and what kind of impulse control he has," 
Hamel said. 
</P>
<P>
In the three years he has been director of Camp Paige, there has not been a 
violent incident involving the chain saws, or the other sharp, dangerous tools 
the boys use in firefighting. But Hamel still worries about that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that I'm not apprehensive about it. That's one thing that always 
weighs on your mind. It's almost like I'm scared to mention it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the violence in a Camp Paige boys' records usually involves a 
group crime, like a gang shooting. "Probably without that group participation, 
these boys would not become involved in violence," Hamel said. "We don't have 
boys here who are sick kids, whose sickness manifests itself in some kind of 
personal violence." 
</P>
<P>
Boys who are sent to Camp Paige must have parental permission to work on fire 
crews. The average ward stays for about six months. During wet winters, they do 
flood control duty. 
</P>
<P>
According to records compiled between 1982 and 1984, about half of the boys 
from probation camps were eventually convicted again of other crimes. There 
have not been any more recent studies following up on boys who are involved in 
the fire program, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering what we start out with, that's pretty good," Hamel said. "Looking 
at their records, you wouldn't give that many of them much hope to do well in 
camp, let alone after they go home." 
</P>
<P>
Although their records as juvenile offenders do not stop them from competing in 
the job market once they are released, only a handful of boys who work on fire 
crews in probation camps actually are hired by the county Fire Department, 
Hamel said. Jobs are scarce, and the boys rarely do well enough on Civil 
Service exams to compete with other applicants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning after the Webb Canyon fire, when the boys returned to the 
probation camp, they showered, ate and bunked down in their barracks-style 
dormitory. But they did not sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hyper, so I didn't feel tired," David said. "It was very exhausting, but 
I enjoyed the excitement and the experience." 
</P>
<P>
"That crew was so wired they just couldn't fall asleep," Hamel said. "This is 
the high they used to get from gang activity and from hurting people. I don't 
know where they'll find it when they get home. But maybe here we've planted a 
seed."

University of California scientists have created maps of an area deep in the 
brains of schizophrenics showing that the "circuitry" connecting key internal 
structures is haywire. The findings may reshape the study of the disorder, the 
researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The previous thinking has been, 'Where is the hole in the brain' " that causes 
schizophrenia, said UC Irvine professor of psychiatry Monte S. Buchsbaum, who 
led the 12-member research team from UC institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The new thinking, based on the team's data, is that there is no single "black 
hole" or abnormality in a schizophrenic's brain, Buchsbaum said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the circuitry among key brain structures -- the thalamus, cortex and 
basal ganglia -- and among sensory organs transmitting taste, touch, hearing or 
vision may be "connected improperly" and fail to communicate correctly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum and several collaborators plan to present their research formally on 
Sept. 13 to 4,000 neuroscientists at the 17th Congress Collegium Internationale 
Neuro-psychopharmacologicum in Japan. They offered a preview Tuesday to 
reporters and to financial backers of UCI's 6-year-old Brain Imaging Center, 
where the research was conducted. The results amplify studies reported in June 
in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that: 
</P>
<P>
* The brain circuitry of a schizophrenic is markedly different from that of a 
normal adult, but each can be quantified and described with detailed charts, 
much like a road maps. 
</P>
<P>
* Brain metabolism in the schizophrenic's basal ganglia -- a structure at the 
center of the brain that affects motor function as well as visual and emotional 
response -- is significantly less active than in a normal adult. 
</P>
<P>
* Both schizophrenics and adults with depressive illness have low metabolism 
rates in the basal ganglia and temporal lobes. But in other areas of the brain, 
these mentally ill adults show contrasting results. For instance, in the 
hippocampus, which is thought to control memory, depressives show a high rate 
of brain activity, but schizophrenics show a low rate of activity. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum suggested that as a schizophrenic's impaired circuitry is studied in 
more detail, eventually the right drug or combination of drugs may be used to 
repair the abnormal links in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lewis L. Judd, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, which 
spent nearly $1 million on this project, said the team's brain circuitry 
finding is "a new observation that will now require confirmation by other 
laboratories." 
</P>
<P>
Judd called Buchsbaum's project "a very important study" that confirms research 
in some areas and breaks new ground in others. 
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia, a devastating and incurable mental illness, affects 2% of 
Americans -- 5 million people across the country, about 46,000 in Orange 
County. Considered an incapacitating and lifelong disease, schizophrenia 
usually begins in adolescence and is characterized by disordered thinking, 
apathy and, frequently, hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, researchers have looked for its cause. Doctors, who once blamed 
upbringing and social conditions, have since the 1960s focused on brain 
abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
With new imaging technology in the 1980s called PETscan (Positron Emission 
Tomography), which measures brain metabolism after an injection of radioactive 
glucose, scientists can study what part of the brain might cause schizophrenia, 
as well as what chemicals might treat it. 
</P>
<P>
But the question for the 1990s is not just what abnormal brain structure or 
chemical causes schizophrenia but, Buchsbaum said: "What is the circuit and how 
is the circuitry abnormal? . . . The circuitry story will be presented for the 
first time in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum, who used to work at the National Institute of Mental Health, was one 
of the world's pioneers in the use of PETscans. With this study of 18 
schizophrenics, he claims another first: offering results from the largest 
PETscan study ever of "never-medicated" schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
(The issue of no medication is important because some researchers have 
suggested that medication used to treat schizophrenics may alter brain 
structures.) 
</P>
<P>
The study contrasted PETscan studies showing brain metabolism from 18 
schizophrenics with those from 22 normal adults, as well as 39 depressed 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
As Buchsbaum's team mapped the brain activity of normal adults and that of 
schizophrenics, they noticed, for instance, that in normal adults, activity 
between inner brain structures called the putamen and caudate are connected. 
</P>
<P>
But in schizophrenics, their data showed, those gray masses -- deep in the 
brain and thought to control motor coordination and possibly also emotion -- 
were not connected.

<P>
Three young men who went to work for the Super Shops automotive parts chain 
because they loved cars are dead -- all for what may prove to be less than a 
few thousand bucks, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a robbery -- the money's gone," company President Gregg Koechlein 
confirmed Tuesday, following early reports that nothing was taken from the 
murder scene. "But it's so inconsequential an amount to think that three people 
were killed for this -- it shocks the conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Tuesday that they still do not know who bound three Super 
Shops employees -- all in their early 20s -- about the time of the store's 5 
p.m. Sunday closing and shot them to death at close range with a handgun in an 
execution-style assault. 
</P>
<P>
Koechlein would not give the amount he believes was stolen, and late Tuesday 
afternoon, Tustin police began sorting through computer receipts and matching 
them against the cash found at the store to try to confirm how much money may 
have been taken. Company sources familiar with the investigation estimated that 
the daily cash receipts taken probably would not exceed several thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted in part by a $50,000 reward from Super Shops, about 25 people called 
police Tuesday with tips about people they may have seen in the area Sunday and 
other possible leads. Investigators are still following those leads but said 
they have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense," said Lt. Houston Williams, 
heading the investigation. "Even if you get a million dollars, is it worth 
executing three people? This is just a vicious, cold-blooded killing -- there's 
no other way to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
Word that the killings appear to have been motivated by robbery offered little 
solace for the grieving families and friends of the three victims, who have 
been searching for any answers to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still pretty much in shock," said Gina Hoffman, the 18-year-old 
girlfriend of victim Darrell Esgar, 22, of Huntington Beach. "I keep wishing I 
had 5 minutes with him. It's just so unfair to have someone taken from you 
without warning for no reason. From what I know, it was just a robbery by 
someone who didn't want to leave witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Esgar, an assistant manager; Chad Chadwick, 22, of Orange, a salesman; and 
Russel B. Williams, 21, of Seal Beach, all shared a love of cars that prompted 
them to work at the Super Shops store, according to family, friends and fellow 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why he went to Super Shops, his love of cars," said Chadwick's mother, 
Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
Esgar shared his love of automobiles with his father, who joined him in working 
late into the night on the son's early-model Mustang and other cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The son is the spitting image of the father," said Bishop Dennis Wallace, who 
has known the family for 10 years as members of his Mormon church. "They are 
both quiet types, in the background, but willing to help anyone at anytime. If 
somebody's car broke down at the church or in the neighborhood, his father was 
always there to go over and fix it up. Darrell was that kind of individual too. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about Darrell is that everybody liked him. He was well-liked in the 
church and where he worked. He never drank alcohol, never did drugs. He never 
even tried them, that's the kind of boy he was. When he went out with his 
friends and they were drinking, he was called the designated driver." 
</P>
<P>
The Super Shops store at the intersection of Tustin Avenue and 1st Street 
remained closed Tuesday as about a dozen employees cleaned up the back storage 
room where the bodies were found, along with the rest of the store, and tried 
to cope with the weekend's events. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's really in a talking mood right now," one young man said when 
approached by a reporter. "Everyone is just trying to deal with this as best 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
Added Alan Basham, a divisional sales manager: "The whole thing is ridiculous; 
it should never have happened. These were good guys." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, talk of the apparent robbery and execution -- atop a few 
other recent incidents against local shops -- sent some tremors through the 
automotive-parts industry as several shops reported that they have stepped up 
security procedures since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One assistant manager at a major local shop said he even brought his gun to the 
store because of the murders. That's against company policy, but the employee, 
who asked not to be identified, said he's not taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried," he said. "They're not going to get me without getting shot 
first." 
</P>
<P>
A regional manager with Trak, a nationwide chain of automotive parts stores, 
said that two of the chain's stores in Long Beach and Hawaiian Gardens have 
been hit by armed robbers in just the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Neither robbery resulted in injuries to anyone, said the manager, who asked not 
to be identified. But he added that "rumors are flying. We have all our stores 
on alert because they seem to be hitting automotive parts stores. We may be 
more of a prime target because we don't generally have a lot of people on duty 
at night." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a Super Shops employee in Long Beach was killed by a bandit who 
stole $2,600 and then shot him behind the counter before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
That murder remains unsolved but, despite the new indications pointing to 
robbery in Tustin, police say the two cases do not appear connected. 
</P>
<P>
"At first glance, this doesn't appear to fit," Williams said. "These killings 
appear to be more calculated, more vicious."

CRIME: SANTA ANA POLICE CONDUCT ANOTHER ROUNDUP IN THE CIVIC CENTER AREA THAT 
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY UNFAIRLY TARGETS THE HOMELESS AND ILLEGAL ALIENS.

<P>
Police Officer Jim Geist whipped out his binoculars and quickly spotted one of 
his targets lurking behind a palm tree in a park off Birch Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, he's got some napkins or something in his hands," Geist said, as his 
partner maneuvered their police cruiser toward the man who appeared to be on 
the verge of defecating in public. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Geist and his partner arrived at the spot, the man was gone. 
The officers moved on, taking up new positions during a controversial roundup 
that critics say unfairly targets the homeless and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Geist and his partner were among a special force of 18 officers deployed 
Tuesday during the second sweep through the Civic Center area in 4 days. The 
goal, police say, is to rid the area of a rise in crime. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's sweep, 26 people were arrested, most for municipal code 
infractions such as drinking in public, blocking entrance ways and urinating in 
public. One man was arrested on suspicion of brandishing a knife and seven 
others were arrested on outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
The first sweep last Thursday, which resulted in 64 people being cited, was met 
with strong opposition from homeless-rights advocates who said that the tactics 
were out of date and smacked of Naziism. 
</P>
<P>
During that sweep, officers scrawled red numbers on the arms of those arrested 
and chained them to a bench at Santa Ana Stadium for 6 hours. Most of those 
cited last week were ticketed for littering, others for jaywalking, urinating 
or drinking in public. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of the detained were later determined to be illegal aliens and were 
turned over to Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests have sparked an outcry from the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, 
which says it will seek a temporary restraining order against further police 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"Other cities are watching Santa Ana do this and will follow suit," said Robert 
J. Cohen, Legal Aid's executive director. "This is going to escalate the 
problems for the homeless everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite opposition, police said they will continue the sweeps in response 
to complaints from government workers and others who say they have been 
routinely harassed and threatened by homeless people outside their office 
buildings on the way to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police invited representatives of the local media to ride along 
during the sweeps in an attempt to generate public support for the new policy. 
Teams of officers on foot and in cars patrolled an area defined by Washington, 
1st, French and Flower streets, in search of people urinating in public, 
drinking or committing other misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene was quieter than officers had expected. Blankets and shopping 
carts stuffed with belongings lay unattended outside the Hall of Administration 
building and the courthouse, as some of the homeless apparently made themselves 
scarce. A few people slept on the grass, oblivious to the commotion around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Some undercover officers were posted on the courthouse rooftop and peered down 
at the street through binoculars, as they do during narcotics surveillances. 
Uniformed officers patrolled the area in police cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew we would be here today," Police Lt. Collie Provence said. "But 
if we stopped one auto burglary by being here today, then that was good." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 707 police incidents were reported in the Civic Center area from 
January to July. This year, the number has increased more than 11% to 790 
incidents reported. In June, 1989, there were 76 crimes reported in the Civic 
Center plaza. In June of this year, 131 incidents were reported, a 72% 
increase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying all of the increase in crime is attributed to the homeless," 
Provence said at a briefing before the roundup. "But we know that some of the 
homeless are also committing some of the crimes. We're here to catch whoever we 
can, not just the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legal Aid officials met with representatives from the public 
defender's office Tuesday to discuss how those arrested would exercise their 
right to a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that Legal Aid and several other civil rights and immigrant rights 
advocates will form a task force to provide legal defense for those cited and 
arrested during the sweeps.

SUPERVISORS EXPECTED TO DELAY VOTE ON JAIL FEE AIMED AT CITIES

<P>
County supervisors are expected to defer voting on a controversial jail booking 
fee today, even though failing to approve it soon could delay a plan to make 
the central courthouse safe in a major earthquake, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the booking fee proposal, city police departments and other agencies 
would be charged $75.50 for each prisoner they brought to the county jail. The 
fee could produce approximately $2.1 million next year, officials estimate. 
Without that money, the county would have to cut programs and projects, some of 
which already are facing possible reductions. 
</P>
<P>
A $1-million plan to reinforce the courthouse -- set to begin this year -- 
could be delayed at least until next year if the supervisors do not establish 
the booking fee, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also targeted for possible cuts are county mental health programs, which have 
already been hit by cuts in the state budget, and law enforcement services such 
as a crime-prevention unit and a county probation program. A plan to add 
sheriff's deputies to patrol South Orange County might also be postponed for 
several months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite county staff support for the booking fee, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
distributed a letter to her colleagues late Tuesday urging that a final 
decision be postponed for 90 days. That would give cities that object to the 
fee three months to respond and still leave the board time to approve the 
proposal before implementing the fees on Jan. 1, Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
If the board later votes to approve the fees, that money would be added back to 
the budget, officials said. If the board balks altogether, however, programs 
would have to be cut from this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider would not comment on specific 
areas that would be subject to cuts, but said: "If the board does not approve 
the $2.1 million in new revenue, then we, in order to balance, would have to 
knock out some appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make up that money somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they asked not to be identified, other county officials said three 
supervisors -- Gaddi H. Vasquez, Roger R. Stanton and Wieder -- are prepared to 
vote against levying the booking fee. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Don R. Roth and Thomas F. Riley are said to support the fee. 
</P>
<P>
With a close vote expected, both sides lobbied hard Tuesday. Supporters of the 
fee said the price of inaction would be even deeper cuts in programs, while 
opponents argued that the fees would damage relations between the county and 
the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"As a former city council member and former mayor, I obviously have some 
empathy for what the impact on them might be," Stanton said. "I don't want to 
be in a position of kicking the dog." 
</P>
<P>
The county administrative office has recommended that supervisors adopt the 
fee, and officials Tuesday released a copy of a report showing that 
California's 10 largest counties are planning to implement jail booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire to implement (the fees) was unanimous among all 10 counties," 
states the report, which was circulated to the supervisors. Six counties are 
considering fees dramatically higher than the $75.50 that Orange County is 
proposing. In Los Angeles County, for instance, supervisors are debating fees 
between $165 and $200. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, Alameda, Riverside and Contra Costa counties are all preparing 
to adopt fees of $100 or more, the report indicates. Only San Francisco, where 
the county and city governments are joined, is considering a proposal lower 
than Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a related county report disputes estimates by some local law 
enforcement agencies of the effects the booking fee would have on cities. Where 
some cities projected massive budget impacts, the county report indicates that 
the results, though severe, would be somewhat more muted. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for instance, city officials predict the loss of as much as $1.6 
million a year if the fee is implemented. The county report estimates the 
impact there at $954,000.

CITY STAFF'S ACTIONS TO BE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday ordered an investigation into city staff's behavior 
in connection with the case of Henry 'n Harry's Goat Hill Tavern. 
</P>
<P>
The council specifically wants to know whether a city employee tipped off bar 
owner Robert R. Ziemer about a neighbor who has led the complaints against the 
bar, which is struggling to keep a conditional use permit to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Ziemer photographed Sheila Ward as she was being led by paramedics to a waiting 
ambulance at her Magnolia Avenue home last December. Her second-story apartment 
faces the back parking lot of several businesses on Newport Boulevard, 
including the Goat Hill Tavern, 1830 Newport Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
He submitted the photos of Ward to the City Council at its July 16 meeting, he 
said, to disprove an entry in Ward's diary that noted disturbances at the bar. 
Ziemer, in a note submitted to the council, said the pictures were taken Dec. 
20, the same day Ward noted complaints about honking, yelling, screaming and 
car alarms going off in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ward admits she erred logging the the date of those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa, who called for the investigation, said he wants to find 
out whether any city employee alerted Ziemer that an ambulance and paramedics 
had been dispatched to Ward's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to investigate our employees but whether we can be assured of 
the public's right to confidentiality when they call on the city's emergency 
personnel," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziemer has said he always keeps a loaded camera at the bar to photograph 
celebrities that drop by. The late Billy Martin and fighter Ken Norton have 
been photographed at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has refused to renew Ziemer's conditional use permit to 
operate the bar, a move which eventually could shut the tavern down. The 
council has heard testimony from surrounding businesses and neighbors and 
received police and fire department reports connecting the bar's patrons to 
several complaints, including being drunk in public, drug possession and 
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 24 police reports were submitted to the council about complaints 
stemming from the bar. However, Ziemer disputes most of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
"My lawyer forced them to go back and look at how many were attributable to us 
and they found there were nine in a period of four months," Ziemer said. 
"That's unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
Ziemer has appealed the council's decision and is awaiting an Oct. 3 hearing 
scheduled in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a hearing before the judge, and we're hoping that he's going to give 
us a (fair) hearing," Ziemer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward says she is happy the city will look into the circumstances surrounding 
the pictures. She refuses to say what she was being treated for when the 
paramedics came. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like at this point I'm living in a fish bowl. If I go out of my 
apartment, I'm called names. . . . I feel these are tactics of intimidation," 
Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a private citizen voicing complaints that I have the right to 
voice."MARY ANNE PEREZ

MAYOR RECUPERATING AFTER HOSPITAL STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan is recuperating at her beach home in Crystal Cove 
today after contracting a lung infection that resembles meningitis because of 
the severe headaches that accompany the condition. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, 55, spent five days at Hoag Hospital for tests and treatment after 
suffering severe headaches early last week. 
</P>
<P>
She left the hospital Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan underwent treatment for a virulent form of influenza and her doctor 
has ordered her to rest at home for at least a week. Her doctor told her to 
avoid contact with people because the illness and medication have weakened her 
resistance to other diseases, Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm grounded," she joked Tuesday. "I'm feeling so good right now. I still have 
residual headaches, and it's going to take me a little while to get over that." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said she is taking long walks on the beach and conducting city 
business at home while recuperating. She has ceased her real estate work in 
order to get more rest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While in the hospital, Sheridan said, she was shocked at the huge outpouring of 
support she received in the form of flowers, balloons, T-shirts and even a 
chocolate shake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to know people care and are concerned," she said.

FREE PARKING ENDS IN PIERSIDE AREA

<P>
The hub of the city's downtown redevelopment center, which this summer has 
begun opening one building at a time, on Tuesday was officially christened a 
new shopping and entertainment district. 
</P>
<P>
That is, the city began charging for parking. 
</P>
<P>
Parking in the Main Promenade Parking Structure, which had been free since it 
opened a week ago, now costs up to $5 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The parking structure on Main Street between Walnut and Olive avenues serves 
shops, restaurants and theaters that have begun opening in the Pierside 
Pavilion, a cornerstone of the area's redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Non-validated parking now costs from $1 for one hour or less to $5 for four or 
more hours. The charge drops to a flat $1 rate at night. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the businesses in the area will offer patrons discount validation 
stickers. During an unspecified introductory period, validated parking will be 
free for up to two hours, and $1 for each additional hour. The city charges 
Pierside Pavilion tenants 25 cents for each validation sticker. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved the rates, after lengthy discussions 
between city officials and business representatives. City officials estimate 
the parking fees will bring the city $297,000 in revenue a year. JOHN PENNER

NEW PRESCHOOL HAS OPENINGS FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several spots are open for the fall term in the new preschool program operated 
by the Centralia School District, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that there are still a lot of parents looking for preschools," said 
Barbara Sanchez, administrator of special programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is critical, especially at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
The district began the preschool in February. The full-day program runs from 
6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and is housed at Buena Terra School, 8299 Holder St. 
Parents can enroll their children in either half-day or full-day spots. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said there are 14 openings created by children who went on summer 
vacations or who are going to kindergarten in September. The program can 
accommodate up to 24 youngsters, 3 and 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The program is unusual because it is one of the few in Orange County that is 
operated by a school district, Sanchez said. Two lead teachers and two 
co-instructors have been hired to oversee the children. 
</P>
<P>
Placement in the program is on a first-come, first-served basis. For more 
information, call (714) 228-3228.

CITY OKS AWARD OF 1ST ARENA CONTRACT, A CLUB PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to award the first construction contract 
for the $100-million Anaheim Arena to Clayton Engineering Inc. of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The $335,000 contract was awarded to construct a temporary parking lot for the 
Phoenix Club. 
</P>
<P>
The club's existing parking lot will be the site of the arena construction. 
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-seat sports arena will be developed and managed by the Ogden Corp. 
of New York and owned by the city, under agreements signed by the City Council 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Ana, in the meantime, is proceeding with plans to build a 
similar arena. Both cities hope to attract basketball and hockey teams. Most 
authorities agree that Orange County can support only one indoor sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler cast the dissenting vote against the 
parking lot construction contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we shouldn't be putting money out for those items. I've said this 
before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the temporary parking lot -- to be built east of the arena site -- is 
scheduled to begin in September and be completed by Nov. 15. Officials hope to 
complete the arena, to be located on Douglass Road, near Anaheim Stadium, by 
the fall of 1992.

SERVICES SATURDAY FOR VICTIMS OF SHOOT-OUT IN SAUDI ARABIA

<P>
Funeral services are scheduled Saturday for a former Orange County woman and 
her 10-year-old daughter who were slain in Saudi Arabia in an incident 
unrelated to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hinkson, who worked as a computer programmer for the Saudi government, is 
expected to arrive in Los Angeles on Thursday with his five children and the 
bodies of his wife, Kimberly, and daughter, Courtney, said his mother, Norma 
Hinkson of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be conducted in Westminster at the Garden Grove chapel of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 10332 Bolsa Ave. Viewing is 
scheduled at 9 a.m., followed by services at 10 a.m.. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Hinkson said that her son, who moved his family seven years ago from 
Orange County to the Saudi capital of Riyadh, is not sure of his plans once he 
returns to the United States. Before the slaying, Kent Hinkson and his 
32-year-old wife had been planning to leave the Middle East and buy a home in 
Provo, Utah, for their family. 
</P>
<P>
"He will probably settle either here in Orange County, so we can help take care 
of the children, or else in Utah," Norma Hinkson said. "But he doesn't know for 
sure at all." 
</P>
<P>
The slaying of Hinkson's wife was unrelated to the events surrounding the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 14 shootings occurred while Hinkson, his wife and four of their six 
children were driving back from a grocery shopping trip, Norma Hinkson said. 
</P>
<P>
As they stopped at an intersection, a suspected Saudi drug smuggler being 
pursued by police commandeered the car and killed 10-year-old Courtney with a 
gunshot to her neck. Saudi police chased the car for 45 minutes, firing 
repeatedly at the vehicle until it stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Hinkson, who was four months pregnant with twins, was fatally wounded 
in the head by police gunfire. The gunman was captured unharmed.

MAN WHO DRIVES WRONG WAY ON FREEWAY ARRESTED IN AUTO THEFT

<P>
A 30-year-old man suspected of auto theft led police on a wild chase Tuesday 
afternoon on Interstate 5, trying to escape by driving into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was hurt, and no accidents occurred, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 1:30 p.m. when an Irvine police officer spotted Juan 
Lopez Herrera, of Jalisco, Mexico, driving a 1987 Isuzu Trooper that had been 
reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, along with Orange County sheriff's deputies, followed the suspect 
as he entered the northbound I-5 from Crown Valley Parkway heading south on the 
dirt shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera exited at Ortega Highway, where he drove across an overpass and 
re-entered the freeway going north in the southbound lanes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After about 200 yards, Herrera was boxed in by traffic and abandoned the 
vehicle, fleeing on foot. Sheriff's deputies captured him a short time later at 
San Juan School, 31642 El Camino Lane. He was booked on suspicion of auto 
theft.

CYPRESS LITTLE LEAGUERS ADVANCE

Two-hit pitching from a player who just recently took up the game of baseball 
and two home runs from a player who had a broken leg earlier this season 
propelled Cypress into the Thursday's U.S. final of the Little League World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrie Cordero struck out 12, including seven of the first nine he faced, and 
walked two while getting strong support from Eddie Zamora in Cypress' 9-0 
victory over Brooklyn, Mich., in Tuesday's first round. Cypress is the Western 
Regional champion; Brooklyn won the Central Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Canadian champion Trail, British Columbia, downed Latin 
American titlist Matamoros, Mexico, 8-3. The next opponent for Cypress will be 
the winner of today's game between East champ Shippensburg, Pa., and South 
champ Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Brito, who caught Cordero's shutout Tuesday, is scheduled to be the 
starting pitcher in Thursday's game (11 a.m., PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Craig, a 12-year-old girl who was the starting pitcher for Trail, lasted 
only three batters, giving up two singles and a walk. Craig went to first base 
and David Caron, who started the game at catcher, pitched six innings in relief 
for Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Trail will play the winner of today's game between European champ Ramstein Air 
Force Base, West Germany, and Far East titlist Tainan County, Chinese Taipei, 
in Thursday's 2 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero moved to Cypress with his family from Brooklyn, N.Y., two years ago and 
had never played baseball until last season, when he was taken in the eighth 
round of his Federal League's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a natural," Cypress Manager Gary Shelton said of Cordero. "He had a 
deadly breaking ball (Tuesday), and he can spot his fastball. When he's got 
both of them going, he's uncanny." 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander had a no-hitter for 4 2/3 innings before Chris Chesney blooped 
a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
"Kerrie's first question when he came off the field was, 'Was that a hit?' " 
Shelton said. Brooklyn's only other hit was a one-out double in the sixth by 
pinch-hitter Danny Lewis. In four previous games, the Central champs had struck 
out only 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a nice job controlling his pitches," said Central Manager Dave Slusher. 
"He moved them around and just had an outstanding day. A pitcher that's on is 
tough to hit. He was on today." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress built a 5-0 lead after two innings. In the first, Brito had a 
run-scoring double, Cordero added an RBI groundout and Jake Koziel drove in a 
run with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress scored two unearned runs in the second when Mark Slevcove and Damon 
Katz reached base on fielder's choices and scored on a throwing error to first 
by pitcher Brad Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' remaining runs came on homers. Pat Murphy and Zamora hit back-to-back 
shots over the center-field fence leading off the fourth and Zamora added a 
two-run blast to center in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the middle of his season, now," said Shelton of Zamora, who missed 12 
of his team's 28-game regular-season schedule after suffering a broken leg. 
"He's strong, and not only is he strong, he's the fastest kid on the team." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why they had Zamora hitting eighth in the lineup, Cypress Coach Ron 
MacDonald said, "He's a feast or famine hitter. Eddie can hit it a long way, 
but when he strikes out, he's way off."

FORMER STATE S&amp;L CHIEF TO TAKE OVER FAILED MERCURY 
</P>

<P>
William J. Crawford, who retired in April as state S&amp;L commissioner, will 
be placed in charge of insolvent Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today, an 
official with the federal regulators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Shields, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corp.'s regional office in 
Denver, said Crawford will be named managing agent of Mercury, which was seized 
by federal regulators in February. The S&amp;L currently has about $2 billion 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is the government agency charged with liquidating the assets of 
insolvent S&amp;Ls. Shields said the managing agent's job is to run the 
day-to-day operations of ailing thrifts, sprucing them up as much as possible 
before selling them for the best price. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, 70, owned and sold two different S&amp;Ls before being named to the 
top state regulatory post in 1985. The Newport Beach resident, who cited his 
age and a desire to travel with his wife as the reason for his resignation from 
the state post, declined comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In his 5 years as state S&amp;L commissioner, Crawford developed a reputation 
as a blunt-spoken, tough regulator. His small staff identified severe abuses at 
several S&amp;Ls in the state, and for a time Crawford's department was running 
ahead of federal regulators as it moved against the offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency acted in advance of federal regulators in seizing North 
American S&amp;L in Santa Ana -- an institution that Crawford said represented 
the worst case of insider fraud in state history. Crawford also cracked down on 
the defunct Ramona S&amp;L in Orange months before federal regulators filed 
criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against owner John L. Molinaro and former 
co-owner Donald C. Mangano. The two received stiff prison sentences earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shields said Crawford has been training at Mercury S&amp;L since July 2. He 
said Crawford originally was slated to take over insolvent Southwest Federal 
Savings Assn. in Los Angeles, but those plans were changed Monday. Crawford 
will replace another RTC official at Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Savings was founded in 1964 by a group of local investors headed by 
Leonard Shane. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, who served as Mercury's chairman from the beginning, rode the housing 
boom into prominence, building Mercury into a nearly $5-billion institution in 
the mid-1980s and becoming chairman of the national thrift industry trade 
group, the once-powerful U.S. League of Savings. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the S&amp;L was held up nationally as a shining example of a 
well-run, conservative S&amp;L. But accounting rules allowed Mercury and other 
thrifts to count as current income certain profits expected to come in from the 
collection of mortgage payments for investors who bought the loans it 
originated. 
</P>
<P>
When dropping interest rates in the late 1980s enabled a large number of 
borrowers to refinance and pay off those loans early, Mercury had to write off 
the profits it had already booked and sustained huge losses that helped drive 
it into insolvency.

FundAmerica Assets to Be Released: A federal bankruptcy judge agreed to release 
$612,115 in assets of FundAmerica Inc., allowing the troubled Irvine marketing 
company to continue in operation and meet its overdue payroll. U.S. Bankruptcy 
Judge James N. Barr delayed a decision on whether to appoint a trustee to run 
FundAmerica but told attorneys for the company and creditors that he would be 
inclined to do so. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday amid 
allegations by authorities in several states that it operates a pyramid scheme.

<P>
In an interview following his remarks to a trade group in Anaheim, Deukmejian 
said he is "not looking to be labeled as California's trade governor, but I 
think we will be recognized for taking a major step in getting California 
involved in the international competitive marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, the governor said, the state has created trade 
programs that have boosted California's exports, maintaining the state's 
position as the leading exporting state in the nation, with foreign sales of 
$43.4 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 700,000 new people coming into the state every year and growing 
unemployment caused by a cutback in defense spending," Deukmejian said. "In 
order for us to have jobs, we have to constantly do things to expand the 
economy. One of the ways to do that is to improve our trade opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The governor, speaking to the World Affairs Council of Orange County, said this 
trade-oriented policy has laid the foundation for the state's businesses to be 
competitive in the world market in the 1990s. He cited the fierce trade 
struggle that is expected when the economies of Western Europe are united in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that 1 million Californians "receive a paycheck that directly or 
indirectly depends on trade," Deukmejian said it is not enough to keep 
California goods and services competitive overseas. He said the state has also 
encouraged California business people to travel overseas and seek out new 
buyers for their products and services. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said his Administration created several programs to expand the 
state's international trade. Those include providing low-interest loans and 
export finance insurance to small- and medium-sized businesses, and encouraging 
companies to participate in foreign trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
To help businesses once they go abroad, the state has opened trade offices in 
London, Tokyo, Mexico City, Frankfurt and Hong Kong since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also warned California's businesses about becoming complacent 
about international trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger that exists for us is to take things for granted," he said. "If we 
start to think that economic expansion and global outlook are luxuries rather 
than necessities, then we risk sliding back to the days of stagnation and 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
He criticized opponents of increased foreign investment in the state and 
offshore oil exploration, describing such attitudes as protectionist and 
counterproductive to increasing trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We must avoid short-term, easy answers that undercut the solid economic 
foundation we have built," he said. That means encouraging foreign investment, 
rejecting fears of foreign control of the local economy and a halt of what he 
called "mindlessly locking away important resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the state reached more than $42 billion last year, which 
the governor said created 300,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he'd like to see his successor continue to build on his trade 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the next administration holds to a view of involving the state in global 
trading," he added, "then I'm confident that they will build on what we've 
started and we'll have more involvement and more jobs created in trade-related 
activity."

PRESIDENT OF THE IRVINE CO.'S NEWPORT COAST UNIT RESIGNS

<P>
Roland Osgood resigned as president of an Irvine Co. unit that oversees the 
company's development on the Orange County coast, the firm said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Osgood said that he has not decided what he will do but that the company has 
offered to let him build homes in its snazzy Newport Coast project. 
</P>
<P>
Or Osgood may work with his son, who is also a home builder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osgood was president and chief executive of home builder Broadmoor Homes before 
joining the big Newport Beach-based landowner in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He will be succeeded as head of the Coastal Community Builders unit by Mike 
Ellis, now a senior vice president. Ellis will not hold the title of president, 
which will be kept vacant, but will run the unit as vice president and general 
manager, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was Northern California president of Covington Homes before joining the 
Irvine Co. in 1985 as vice president of land development. He was promoted to 
senior vice president in 1987 and has been responsible for managing land 
development, engineering and building permits for the company's projects near 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Osgood joined the company as president of Irvine Pacific, another unit that 
oversaw housing construction on the company's vast landholdings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 he was named president of the Land Development Group and oversaw all 
the company's land development. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 the company reorganized its units along geographical lines instead of 
by activities, and Osgood was named president of Coastal Community Builders. 
His major project has been the Newport Coast, a project to build hotels and 
houses on the hills between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach.

ATHLETICS: FOOTBALL PLAYERS AT SERVITE HIGH GATHER FOR THE SECOND ANNUAL 
BUZZ-OFF AND SEE THEIR LOCKS THROWN FOR A LOSS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, even James Christensen's impressive size -- 300 pounds, 6-foot-4 -- 
couldn't save him. 
</P>
<P>
He went down with the rest of the Servite High School football players -- 
whipped by electric clippers that left them looking like a team of Kojaks. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 football players from the all-boys Catholic high school in Anaheim, 
and just as many parents, siblings and girlfriends, crammed into Salon Russo in 
Brea last week for the second annual buzz-off. 
</P>
<P>
Some players joked about getting the regulation buzz cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a little off the sides," said one, settling into the barber's chair. 
</P>
<P>
Some complained. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my hair," a player mourned, seeing his brown locks land in clumps on 
his lap. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the end, each player succumbed to the barber's razor. Not a cowlick was 
left standing. 
</P>
<P>
David Russo, who owns the salon with his wife and parents, offered the players 
free buzz cuts as a way of turning a dreaded event into "a day they look 
forward to." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember how getting a buzz was more dreadful than getting hit by a 
150-pound moose," he said. Russo weighed just 98 pounds during his high school 
football career, which he spent warming the bench because the coach feared for 
his safety on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Russo plied the players with pizza and soft drinks before joining his fellow 
barbers in administering the regulation haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
All football players at Servite must wear their hair no longer than 1/8th of an 
inch all the way around the scalp. 
</P>
<P>
"You just follow the contour of the head," Russo said. "It's like peeling an 
orange." 
</P>
<P>
If players have enough hair leftover to pinch between their two fingers, it's 
too long. The team levies a serious penalty on anyone whose hair isn't short 
enough by Hell Week: Teammates are allowed to shave the offender's scalp. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys will make a checkerboard pattern on their heads," said Mark Glaudini, 
athletic trainer for Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the barbers plugged in their clippers, a decree went out to all of 
the players: 
</P>
<P>
"No guard," yelled Scott Jones, the 17-year-old varsity quarterback. Without a 
metal guard placed on the electric clippers, the players would receive the 
shortest cuts possible. 
</P>
<P>
"No guard even if they ask for it -- it shows more discipline," Jones 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Three stylists worked on the players, while their parents hovered nearby taking 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to have dreadlocks," said Dave Parkinson, 17, a linebacker for the 
varsity team with a head of unruly blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson feigned nonchalance at his pending buzz. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're cool," he said, settling into the barber's chair while Gene 
Russo, David's father, wrapped a red drape around Parkinson's large neck. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you ready?" Gene Russo asked, his clippers aimed at Parkinson's head. 
Parkinson shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it feels good," he said, as Russo shaved a swath across his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson picked at the tufts of hair falling in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like girls' hair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Throw it down if you don't want it," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
When Gene Russo finished, Parkinson looked like Mr. Clean. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, 17, the varsity team's huge offensive tackle, waxed philosophic on 
his baldness. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem. Hair's hair -- it'll grow back," he said, as David Russo went to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen's bald head made him look more menacing. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you want to meet up with him?" a parent asked. 
</P>
<P>
During the buzz-off, the already shorn players milled around the salon poking 
fun at whoever was in the chairs. They gathered around one boy after the 
clippers revealed he had a pronounced widow's peak. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he looks like Eddie Munster," shouted a player, to the guffaws of his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
They compared skulls, making sure nobody went away with too much hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Mike's hair is too long," complained Parkinson, seeing 17-year-old Mike 
Hill, a wide receiver, with a 5 o'clock shadow covering his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
"Dude, this is 1/8th of an inch right here," Hill said, pinching at his skull. 
"My hair's just darker than yours." 
</P>
<P>
Some left the chairs rubbing their scalps, feeling only prickles where their 
hair used to be. Others quickly donned bandannas or baseball caps, then studied 
their new look in the mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a skinhead convention?" joked one. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Muller, mother of 15-year-old linebacker Matt, stood holding a clump of her 
son's hair in her fist. 
</P>
<P>
"His girlfriend wanted some," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In little more than an hour, all of the players were bald, their hair swept 
into a huge pile in a corner of the salon. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews from onlookers were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Tane Russo, David's wife, stared thoughtfully at one player's skull. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a pretty egg shape," she said finally, trying to be kind. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, the players stopped to pose for a team picture. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen, they were headed for the coach's house, carrying a large 
plastic trash bag filled with hair.

MOVIES: WHILE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS MAKE THEIR LAST RUNS, THE STUDIOS ARE GEARING 
UP FOR FALL WITH MORE ADULT-THEMED, PRESTIGIOUS FILMS. HOPES ARE HIGH FOR 
RINGING UP BIG NUMBERS. 
</P>

<P>
Ah, fall . . . . 
</P>
<P>
An adult can safely venture back to the movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The body-count films of summer yield their spaces for more thoughtful and 
prestigious fare. 
</P>
<P>
Generalizations? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Any season that features work by such stellar directors as Martin 
Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Mike Nichols, James Ivory and Philip Kaufman, to name 
a few, leads to higher expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Films do change in the fall," said Tom Sherak, 20th Century Fox's marketing 
and distribution president. "The material seems to get more upscale, more 
adult." 
</P>
<P>
"Fall is within striking distance of the awards," added Greg Morrison, Pathe 
International's president of worldwide marketing, noting that historically, a 
preponderance of the films receiving nominations are late fall/Christmas-season 
releases. "If you open much earlier than fall, it's very difficult to get the 
loop-line going to the end-of-the-year awards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As summer wanes, fading fast are those $100 million-plus box-office 
blockbusters: "Pretty Woman," "Total Recall," "Ghost," "Die Hard 2" and "Dick 
Tracy." Not to mention those "lesser-grossing" films and sequels: "Days of 
Thunder," "RoboCop 2," "Gremlins 2," "The Two Jakes," "Another 48 HRS.," "Young 
Guns 2" and "Back to the Future, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, "lesser grossing" is a relative term. When a film's budget is high, 
like the $50 million to $55 million "Days of Thunder," and it grosses $76.9 
million (to date) during summer, a good number of film executives have been 
known to become squeamish. They'd rather place their bets on a lower costing 
film that has a potential of generating income several times over the cost -- 
the kind of movie more typical of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Among last year's examples, Tri-Star's low budget "Look Who's Talking," 
released in October, went on to gross $138 million and is still earning revenue 
in the home-video market; the September release of the Al Pacino starrer, 
Universal's "Sea of Love," did $57 million in business. 
</P>
<P>
This fall's first big weekend arrives Sept. 14 with the release of three highly 
anticipated films, starring a slew of stars, ranging from Clint Eastwood to 
Meryl Streep to Jeff Bridges. The "season" ends mid-November, when the first of 
the Christmas holiday pictures arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall leaves barely turn and we're already ringing Christmas bells," 
chuckled Pathe's Morrison, whose company releases films through MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the holiday season is more and more encroaching on what was 
traditionally considered fall. This year, several of the larger holiday-size 
movies, such as "Rocky V: The Final Bell" starring Sylvester Stallone, and 
"Kindergarten Cop" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, are scheduled for release 
the week before Thanksgiving Day. They will be followed by Francis Coppola's 
"The Godfather Part III," opening Nov. 21, the day before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, back to September: 
</P>
<P>
Looming large on the horizon is Eastwood's portrayal/impersonation of the late 
John Huston in Eastwood's "White Hunter, Black Heart" (Warner Bros., Sept. 14), 
a film adaptation of Peter Viertel's thinly disguised novel about the making of 
"The African Queen." Jeff Fahey, George Dzundza and Marisa Berenson also star 
in this film about a brilliant and erratic filmmaker obsessed with hunting an 
African elephant. 
</P>
<P>
More drama set against a filmmaking background will come in "Postcards From the 
Edge" (Columbia, Sept. 14), Mike Nichols' film adaptation of Carrie Fisher's 
semi-autobiographical novel about a mother-daughter relationship in Hollywood. 
The film stars Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
"Texasville" (Columbia, Sept. 14), the sequel to 1971's Oscar-winning "The Last 
Picture Show," reunites Peter Bogdanovich with such original cast members as 
Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Eileen Brennan, Cloris Leachman 
and Randy Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
In "GoodFellas" (Warner, Sept. 21), director Scorsese and star Robert De Niro 
reteam to tell yet another true story, based on Nicholas Pileggi's book 
"Wiseguy," of a Brooklyn kid "adopted" by neighborhood gangsters and raised as 
a member of their crime family. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Joe Pesci and Paul 
Sorvino co-star for producer Irwin Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
Psychological terror drives three films this fall. In "Pacific Heights" (Fox, 
Sept. 28) a tenant, Matthew Modine, terrorizes landlords Melanie Griffith and 
Michael Keaton. John Schlesinger directs this true-story thriller. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Desperate Hours" (MGM/UA, Sept. 28), Michael Cimino's remake of the 
1955 chiller, Mickey Rourke assumes the Humphrey Bogart role of the escaped 
convict who holds a family captive. Anthony Hopkins, Mimi Rogers, Lindsay 
Crouse and Kelly Lynch also star. 
</P>
<P>
Another feature in an autobiographical mode is Barry Levinson's "Avalon" 
(Tri-Star, Oct. 5), a saga based loosely on his own immigrant family's pursuit 
of the American dream through three generations. The ensemble cast includes 
Elizabeth Perkins, Joan Plowright, Aidan Quinn, Leo Fuchs and Lou Jacobi. 
</P>
<P>
Using the journals of Anais Nin, writer-director Philip Kaufman explores a 
real-life sexual awakening in "Henry and June" (Universal, October), in which a 
young woman is torn among her husband, author Henry Miller and Miller's exotic 
and mysterious wife. Fred Ward, Uma Thurman, Maria de Medeiros, Richard E. 
Grant and Kevin Spacey star. 
</P>
<P>
"Memphis Belle" (Warner, Oct. 12) marks the first film from British producer 
David Puttnam since his departure as head of Columbia Pictures. Matthew Modine, 
Eric Stoltz, John Lithgow, D.B. Sweeney and Billy Zane star in this drama about 
American airmen who flew a B-17 bomber during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
One widely heralded independent from the film festival circuit is "To Sleep 
With Anger" (Samuel Goldwyn, Oct. 19), a contemporary drama written and 
directed by Charles Burnett. Danny Glover stars as a seemingly benevolent 
visitor whose presence precipitates a clash of values and loyalties in a black 
Los Angeles family. 
</P>
<P>
From the Coen brothers -- Joel (writer-director) and Ethan (writer) -- comes 
"Miller's Crossing" (Fox, Oct. 5), a 1929 tale of the political and gang 
warfare in an Eastern city which erupts from a shattered friendship. Gabriel 
Byrne, Albert Finney and John Turturro star. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grifters" (Miramax, Nov 9), another Scorsese production -- which he 
produced for director Stephen Frears -- brings to the screen a yarn by Jim 
Thompson, whose novels about criminal personalities have long fascinated 
filmmakers. John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and Anette Bening star in this 
exploration of the world of con artists. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck plays an American cowboy who must battle man and nature in "Quigley 
Down Under" (MGM/UA Oct. 19), an Australian Western directed by "Lonesome 
Dove's" Simon Wincer. Laura San Giacomo plays a mysterious woman who thinks 
Quigley is a ghost named Roy. 
</P>
<P>
In the suspense film "Jacob's Ladder" (Tri-Star, Nov. 2), strange visions haunt 
a Vietnam vet who fears for his sanity. Adrian Lyne directs Tim Robbins, 
Elizabeth Pena and Danny Aiello in this tale of military experiments and 
psychological terror. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish and Ireland figure in several films. In the political thriller 
"Hidden Agenda" (Hemdale, late October), director Ken Loach focuses on an 
investigation into the murder of an American human-rights worker. In "Fools of 
Fortune" (New Line, Sept. 14), directed by Pat O'Connor, Julie Christie and 
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star in a family saga set within the Irish 
rebellion against England. 
</P>
<P>
In "State of Grace" (Orion, Oct. 5), directed by Phil Joanou, Sean Penn plays a 
man who returns to his Hell's Kitchen neighborhood where he must choose between 
the cold-blooded Irish street gang of his youth and his family and girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
In his political thriller "The Man Inside" (New Line, Oct. 26), writer-director 
Bobby Roth tells the true story of German investigative reporter Gunter 
Wallraff and his undercover operation that exposed the corrupt practices of his 
country's leading newspaper. Jurgen Prochnow, Peter Coyote and Nathalie Baye 
head an international cast. 
</P>
<P>
In a different kind of political thriller, "Life and Nothing But" (Orion 
Classics, Sept./Oct.), Bertrand Tavernier dramatically explores the question of 
who really lies beneath Paris' Arc de Triomphe in the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier. Such previous Tavernier players as Philippe Noiret and Sabine Azema 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hackman and Anne Archer get trapped aboard a train carrying hit men out to 
kill them in "Narrow Margin" (Tri- Star, Sept. 21), a thriller directed by 
Peter Hyams. 
</P>
<P>
Many intimate, smaller dramas also are on the fall schedule: 
</P>
<P>
In "The Hot Spot" (Orion, Sept. 21), Don Johnson plays a drifter who becomes 
involved with two disturbing desirable women, Virginia Madsen and Jennifer 
Connelly. Dennis Hopper directs this tale of a dangerous triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward star in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" (Miramax, 
September), a story of a marriage set in Kansas City and Paris from 1919 to 
1944. James Ivory directs a screenplay by his frequent collaborator, Ruth 
Prawer Jhabvala, based on two Evan Connell novels. 
</P>
<P>
In "White Palace" (Universal, Oct. 6), Luis Mandoki directs James Spader, Susan 
Sarandon and Eileen Brennan in a story of a young widower who falls in love 
with an older woman from the wrong side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"Tune in Tomorrow" (Cinecom, Oct. 12), based loosely on Mario Vargas Llosa's 
novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," sees a young man befriend a crack 
soap-opera writer and fall in love with his aunt. Barbara Hershey, Keanu Reeves 
and Peter Falk star for director John Amiel. 
</P>
<P>
"Reversal of Fortune" (Warner, Oct. 26), produced by Oliver Stone, concerns the 
Claus von Bulow trial. Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons and Ron Silver star for 
director Barbet Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
In "Vincent &amp; Theo" (Hemdale, early Nov.), Robert Altman directs Tim Roth 
and Paul Rhys in his exploration of the relationship between the Van Gogh 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
In the comedy/fantasy category:

I am writing this from somewhere in my home. For security reasons, I cannot 
tell you what room I'm in. I can tell you only that I'm sitting in front of a 
TV set doing my job. It's getting pretty hairy here, and I may have to move to 
another room and TV set at a moment's notice.

More television coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen again are pictures from Saudi Arabia, where United States forces 
and media are continuing their buildup. In front of the camera this time, 
however, is a man in a gas mask. Now he is speaking from behind the gas mask. 
Now he is removing the gas mask. Behold . . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulf area has been the scene of more than one invasion in recent weeks, the 
latest by media who have shaped these sands of turbulence into a stage for 
themselves. When does "A Current Affair" show up? 
</P>
<P>
News ratings have risen dramatically across the board since Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, indicating the public's intense interest in this increasingly volatile 
story. So, if you want exposure, you take your shot. 
</P>
<P>
That means NBC's "Today" program -- still seeking quick fixes for its ratings 
problems of recent months -- has Gumbel in Saudi Arabia this week, hosting the 
show from a sandy flat area in front of a busy road. Live and in stereo. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you our exact location, but we are only a few miles from where 
U.S. forces are based," said a preppy-looking Gumbel, sitting in a chair on a 
red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he sent it back to Deborah Norville, Joe Garagiola and Al Roker (filling 
in for The Willard) in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryant," a grinning, joshing Norville said Tuesday, "everybody has been saying 
hi to the folks back home. Anything you want to say?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just, it's hot here," Gumbel replied. 
</P>
<P>
Back in New York, the "Today" gang convulsed with laughter at Gumbel. He might 
as well have been talking about the heat in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was on to Norville's interview with Donald Trump, followed by 
Gumbel's interview with two Army officers in battle gear. Later, Norville would 
have a cooking segment. 
</P>
<P>
And from Gumbel: "More ahead from Saudi Arabia and New York after these 
messages." 
</P>
<P>
He is the message. It works this way. Gumbel returns to New York in a week or 
so (depending on how long the Saudis allow the Western media to remain), and 
NBC trumpets "Today" as the only morning show that went to Saudi Arabia. 
Earlier in the gulf crisis, "CBS This Morning" co-host Harry Smith reported 
from Cairo and Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Even as "Today" was covering what Norville labeled "the doings in Iraq," 
meanwhile, CBS anchorman Dan Rather was spending the morning in Amman, Jordan, 
having just returned with eight of his CBS colleagues from Baghdad, after 
spending almost a week in the Iraqi capital. 
</P>
<P>
Although CBS, too, was using the gulf crisis as a showcase -- for Rather -- 
there was no denying the value of his and his colleagues' work in perilous 
Baghdad, succeeding an ABC crew led by Ted Koppel and Forrest Sawyer. Despite 
only rarely being allowed to transmit video from Baghdad, CBS for a time was at 
least a tiny keyhole in Iraq's sand curtain. It was Rather, on the phone, who 
broke the story about Iraq's "hostage human-shield strategy." And when Rather 
reported being warned by Western diplomats in Baghdad that Americans should 
expect "a fight to the finish" with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his words 
carried an especially ominous tone because he was there. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, correspondent Allen Pizzey and the rest of the CBS group returned to 
Amman early Tuesday after being told by Iraqi authorities that they "would be 
advised" to leave, a CBS spokeswoman said. Rather's plans were undecided, but 
he may return to New York this week, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear why Iraq had let in the ABC and CBS groups in the first 
place and then, in effect, booted them out. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone from Washington, Koppel repeated Monday that he had been 
"invited" to leave Baghdad last week. The "invitation" came after he had spoken 
with Americans then being held in a Baghdad luxury hotel and later interviewed 
Foreign Minister Tarek Aziz for "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Koppel: "After I had done the Aziz interview, I met with one of the officials 
in the Foreign Ministry and said I still had some things I wanted to do. I 
wanted to get some of those people (American hostages) on camera, and I also 
wanted to talk to Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What do you think I will be able to do tomorrow?' And the official 
said, 'Departure?' I said, 'I'm not ready to leave yet.' And he said, 'The time 
is right.' " 
</P>
<P>
That convinced Koppel the time was right. So he left, ABC having negotiated for 
Sawyer and a crew to stay another day. 
</P>
<P>
Koppel speculates that he and ABC were allowed into the country at least in 
part because Iraq wanted to use "Nightline" to convey a "softer line through 
their Foreign Ministry." That became the Aziz interview. Koppel speculates that 
ABC was ousted from the country because "one, we had done what they invited me 
to do. Two, they were upset we had visited the hostages. Three, they had Rather 
and his group coming in and they didn't want to juggle more than one (U.S. TV 
network) at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's other members of the media -- whether Gumbel and NBC anchorman Tom 
Brokaw in Saudi Arabia or reporters from local stations elsewhere in the Middle 
East -- who are being juggled by their host countries. That's because more and 
more media people have started riding this highly promotable camel. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, KCAL Channel 9 billed itself on the air as "the only Los Angeles 
television station with a reporter in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," said KTTV Channel 11 news director Dick Tuininga, noting 
that his station recently dispatched reporter Tom Vacar to Bahrain. A quiet Tom 
Vacar. 
</P>
<P>
Vacar reported briefly by phone Sunday night, but, curiously, was not heard 
from Monday during Channel 11's regular 10 p.m. newscast or the first of its 
half-hour gulf-crisis updates that it plans to run indefinitely at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have anything to report," said Tuininga. "Our goal was for him to 
cover Southland soldiers and sailors, not the war." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 9 could not be blamed for crowing about its reporter, David Jackson, 
who, while being in Amman almost since the inception of the crisis, has done 
yeoman work in helping to fill the station's three-hour nightly news block and 
its 11 p.m. gulf-crisis specials. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jackson, however, who read on the air Monday night a letter -- "a last 
will and testament," he called it -- from a British oil worker trapped in 
Kuwait. Jackson said the letter, from someone he identified as Rob, was one of 
many passed to him by refugees flowing into Amman from Kuwait, with the request 
that he mail them. Although Jackson said the letter was outside the envelope 
when he received it, it was private, presumably, and not meant for our 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
There were other excesses on the air Monday: 
</P>
<P>
On Channel 9, anchorman Jerry Dunphy asked, leading into a commercial break, 
"Are we trying to provoke an all-out war with Saddam Hussein?" After the break, 
Dunphy quoted "some military advisers" as suggesting this indeed was the case, 
but didn't identify them or offer any substantiation. 
</P>
<P>
On Channel 11, Ron Gardner, a reporter in Washington for another Fox station, 
suggested out of the blue that the 35 Americans who disappeared from their 
luxury hotel in Baghdad "may have gone into hiding on their own." Maybe there, 
in the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, finally, KNBC Channel 4's Colleen Williams mentioned on the air a 
report that she attributed to a French TV anchor, who said he was told by 
Iraqis in Baghdad that captured U.S. pilots "would be eaten, cannibalized." 
</P>

A FIELD OF DREAMS FROM SMITHSONIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That summer the boy was a skinny 9-year-old, his cousin George -- an awesomely 
seasoned sandlot pitcher of 11 -- dragooned the klutzy kid onto the diamond. 
The kid promptly broke a bat, stubbed his thumb on a pop fly and fell asleep in 
the outfield, covered with chalk dust. To George's disgust, the kid threw in 
the towel. Feeling wimpy and alienated, the boy has skulked about for the rest 
of his life pretending the national pastime does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when an exhibition of art about baseball turned up scheduled at the San 
Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, the thoughts it triggered in him were 
aesthetic, not sportive. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? A seaside sanctuary normally devoted to purist 
avant-garde art hosts a Smithsonian traveling show called "Diamonds Are 
Forever" (to Oct. 21). The show includes fine art by people as well known as 
Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Lewis Hine. There are quotations from famous 
authors like Jacques Barzun and Neil Simon, not to mention a vitrine full of 
Babe Ruth memorabilia and a big projection TV broadcasting such classics as 
Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" routine. 
</P>
<P>
Well, everybody knows museums are under pressure to popularize themselves these 
days. Trustees want to draw big crowds to help defray ever-escalating costs. 
Healthy attendance encourages benefactors and eases the getting of grants. 
Besides, it makes the board feel popular and successful to have a museum full 
of happy viewers who enjoy the art rather than an empty museum haunted by weird 
artniks and citizens who complain they don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, museums have shown great deftness in concocting exhibitions that 
successfully walk the line between popularity and respectability. Real 
disasters, like the time the San Diego Museum of Art showed the Muppets, are 
rare. All the same, "Diamonds Are Forever" ignited suspicions of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, it's a delightful show. Only a crank with a tissue-thin 
epidermis would be offended by it. Even somebody who consciously ignores 
baseball is touched and illuminated by the affection it has inspired in artists 
and photographers, comedians and writers. Baseball isn't just about itself, 
it's about America's most cherished images of itself. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was founded to be a rational Eden. The mental image that 
conjures up looks very much like a baseball stadium all neatly divided into 
bleachers for the fans, field and dugouts for the players. Ballparks depicted 
by artists like Jim Dow show fields green as pastoral emeralds. The point of 
the game, as a wiser man observed, is to get to home. Back home to the wife and 
kiddies, cozy and safe. French artist Raoul Dufy got the idyllic, playful feel 
of the grounds down just right. It's too bad Georges Seurat never did a 
baseball picture. The game's gentler poetry would harmonize well with 
Pointillism. 
</P>
<P>
Americans like to think of themselves as competing fair and square, according 
to the rules and without violence. The layout of the baseball field is clear 
and rational. Rival pitcher and batter face each other squarely as individuals 
who will duel not with saber and six-shooter but with bat and ball. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial team spirit operates more indirectly on the field with every player 
and runner in his position. It looks simple, but the subtleties of play, I'm 
told, are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Artschwager looks at a game from the point of view of a high fly, 
dwarfing players. Tina Chaden puns in a model stadium titled "The Baseball 
Fan," where the infield is made of a lady's fan. 
</P>
<P>
Americans like to think they are straight-ahead folks whose prefered style is 
simplicity. Baseball uniforms have the functional naivete of 
turn-of-the-century boys' outfits with their caps and knickers. Artists like 
Gerald Garston and Robert Gwathmey see players in an ice cream colored folk-art 
style. Edward Larson made a weather-vane whirligig called "Ronald Reagan 
Strikes Out on Foreign Policy." Baseball blends well with Pop style and with 
the kind of populist realism practiced by Harvey Dinnerstein. Lance Richbourg 
renders a slide into second base with the metaphysical stillness of a Morandi. 
It all makes you wonder if there aren't baseball pictures by Eakins and Hopper 
around somewhere. If there are, they aren't here. 
</P>
<P>
That's all fine but what does baseball have to do with art, really? Actually 
quite a lot. They share qualities of subdued competition, myth-making and 
hero-worship. Both need lots of style and graceful execution that cannot be too 
obvious lest they appear artificial. Among the nicest pieces here are a pair of 
bronzes by John Dreyfuss which share some of the manner of Elie Nadelman's 
blend of folk plainness and Cocktail Moderne chic. Dreyfuss depicts a pitcher 
at that moment of casual otherworldly contemplation just before the windup. He 
stands alone as sleek as Brancusi's "Bird in Flight" on a pedestal facing a 
praying mantis catcher across the way. The empty space between is ethereal. 
Only the relationship counts. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition never goes sour, but it does get a little edgy when it gets too 
cute or too serious about itself. When James Sullivan draws a hardball atop a 
classical column and Harvey Breverman puts one in the hand of Michelangelo's 
God as he reaches for Adam's finger, it's clear if obvious fun. When Jim 
Markowich presents a model cathedral whose stained glass depicts baseball 
scenes, you just shrug and walk away looking for something more fibrous to chew 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fischl tries for it in "Boys at Bat" which shows a shy kid in uniform 
uneasily watching his nude father bat one in the back yard. It's heavy-handed 
Freudianism, and desire to shock is not worthy of the nuances of either sport 
or art. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the wry gentleness of things that are more telling, like William King's 
shiny red vinyl sculptural fantasy, "Self as Doubleday," or Scott Mlyn's photo 
of fans ogling a New York Yankee hero. A young guy is as healthily worshipful 
as the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamonds Are Forever" might be accused of trying to perpetuate a myth in a 
real world where baseball has become big corporate business and scandals erupt 
around heroes like Pete Rose. Much the same thing has happened to art in a 
lobotomized bottom-line world seemingly determined to reduce everything to the 
same dreary commercial sludge. Well, recently George Steinbrenner was forced to 
give up ownership of the Yankees, which I'm told was a victory for the good 
guys. When a Van Gogh goes for $50 million at auction the painting rises above 
the fray and remains itself. Some human activities inspire irrepressible 
idealization, thank goodness.

RE 'MISS SAIGON,' WILL THE SHOW GO ON? MAYBE; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE PRODUCER SAYS HE WOULD RECONSIDER BRINGING THE MUSICAL TO BROADWAY 
IF HIS DEMANDS ARE MET. STAR JONATHAN PRYCE HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Producer Cameron Mackintosh might bring "Miss Saigon" to New York next spring 
-- but only if Actors' Equity meets his demands. 
</P>
<P>
The producer of the controversial $10-million hit London musical insisted in a 
statement released Tuesday that he "be assured that Equity will act responsibly 
so that we do not become victims of an inflexible casting process." 
</P>
<P>
His casting of the London star Jonathan Pryce as a Eurasian in the production 
set off a wave of protest among Asian American activists, prompting Actors' 
Equity on Aug. 7 to deny Pryce a permit to perform on Broadway. Despite a 
$25-million advance ticket sale, Mackintosh canceled the lavish production the 
next day, saying he would reconsider bringing the musical to New York only "if 
rational minds prevail within the membership of Equity." 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, after having been petitioned by several hundred members 
protesting Equity's original decision, the union's council reversed its ruling 
on Pryce. The union, in a statement, acknowledged that it had "applied an 
honest and moral principle in an inappropriate manner." 
</P>
<P>
If Mackintosh decides to bring the show to Broadway, he "would still like 
Jonathan Pryce to do the show in New York," said a spokesman for the producer 
in New York on Tuesday, "and Jonathan still would like to do the show." 
</P>
<P>
But Mackintosh's response Tuesday still left open the question of whether he 
would cancel his cancellation. A spokesman for the producer said that his 
decision would depend on how Equity reacts to "whatever conditions he has 
regarding artistic freedom" by early September. 
</P>
<P>
Equity officials said they would not issue a statement on Tuesday, but would 
consider the matter and respond sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the absence of a 
positive working environment and an understanding, agreed to without 
reservation by all, that artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised," 
said Mackintosh's statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh wrote that Equity's most recent ruling was made "solely on the 
technical basis of Mr. Pryce's acknowledged star status. As I have repeatedly 
stated, it is also essential that the profoundly unpleasant atmosphere 
currently surrounding the production be dispelled. This can only be achieved 
with Equity's leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh wrote a separate letter to Equity outlining "the main areas of 
casting which we believe require our mutual collaboration." Neither 
Mackintosh's spokesman nor Equity would make a copy of the letter available at 
press time. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to future companies of "Miss Saigon," Mackintosh's 
statement noted that he "would be absolutely delighted to find and cast an 
Asian actor for the role of the Engineer (Pryce's role), but I would be equally 
delighted to find and cast a Black, Hispanic, Caucasian, or Native American 
actor with the talent, experience, and charisma necessary for the role." 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh also noted that "There are many casting complexities to be resolved 
. . . beyond the role of the Engineer. There are 27 jobs (in the New York 
production) intended for Asian actors. However, at present it is our 
understanding that of Equity's membership of 40,000 actors, only approximately 
400 are of Asian background. Clearly, we will need to work together with Equity 
and the Asian community to increase this talent pool. We have announced our 
commitment to assist in the vocal training of those Asian actors who may be 
considered for these jobs." 
</P>
<P>
In reversing its initial barring of Pryce on Thursday, the union said that 
Pryce qualified as a star according to the criteria set by its agreement with 
the League of American Theatres and Producers. "It has never been Equity's 
intention for this issue to reflect in any way on Mr. Pryce, whose excellence 
and abilities the union has consistently acknowledged," a union statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors' Equity welcomes Jonathan Pryce and wishes Cameron Mackintosh's 
production of 'Miss Saigon' a long and prosperous run," the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
However, the statement also noted that Mackintosh had acknowledged "that Mr. 
Pryce removed the prosthetics on his eyes (designed to make him look more 
Asian) 'immediately upon his becoming aware that their intended use offended 
members of the American-Asian community.' " 
</P>
<P>
The union asserted that "there has now been an admission that there was no 
intent or desire to audition or employ an Asian to portray the role of the 
Engineer in the London production. The anger of the Asian community is 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, Pryce was not satisfied with Equity's response. He told The 
Times before his last appearance in the role in London that he felt as if the 
union were telling him, "We'll let you in, but you're still a racist -- a star 
racist." Equity's statement last Thursday "failed to address" the racial issue 
at the heart of the controversy, Pryce said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mackintosh used a more conciliatory tone in addressing the playwright 
and star of "M. Butterfly," who were instrumental in raising the issue of 
Pryce's being cast as a Eurasian. "I would like to thank (actor) B.D. Wong and 
(playwright) David Henry Hwang for making us aware of all the past and present 
discrimination and injustice that the Asian acting community, and all actors of 
color, have suffered and continue to suffer. . . . If i was initially skeptical 
of their motives, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Refunds are still being issued to ticket buyers who request them, said the 
Mackintosh spokesman, but by last Friday, only 200 refund requests had been 
received. "Most people are still waiting to see how it will turn out," he 
noted.

BEST FRIEND.

"Minnie 'n Me, Songs Just for Girls," the first release from Walt Disney 
Records' new live-artist recording division, is due out this week on CD and 
cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a massive merchandising of Minnie Mouse-themed product, it's not 
just an album, it's a "lifestyle campaign," according to Mark Jaffee, vice 
president in charge of the division. 
</P>
<P>
With such titles as "The Girls of Minnie Street," "Funderful, Wonderful 
Friends," "Jump Rope Rap" and "Party Slumbering," the songs on the album 
feature lyrics about pets, doing chores, future goals, being friends and 
"dressing sharp." (There are two classics: "Animal Crackers in My Soup," and 
"Swinging on a Star.") 
</P>
<P>
All are sung by Christa Larson of Anaheim, an appealing, 11-year-old veteran 
who cut her teeth on a two-year national run of "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
She's the Me in "Minnie 'n Me" and represents all little girls whom Disney 
hopes will be attracted to the new Minnie "philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little girl's lifestyle," Jaffee said. "The songs, dancing, the upbeat 
flavor of the video that we filmed a couple of weeks ago -- in essence, it's an 
entire way of looking at little girls, how they think, look and interact. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Minnie 'n Me' gives little girls their own hero and their own person who can 
be their best friend," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The video, which begins airing in September on the Disney Channel and 
Disney-owned KCAL Channel 9, is "the first ever short-form video for children 
made around one song ('The Girls of Minnie Street')," Jaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
In the video, "you can see and feel 'Minnie Street.' If everybody was part of 
this lifestyle," he said, "here's what it would look like. It features 60 girls 
dancing, all sorts of activities, humor, bright colors, fun and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he acknowledged that the video will be used "for promotional 
purposes," Jaffee objects to its being perceived as a commercial for the album 
and related merchandise. "It's not like an ad for products," he said. "The kids 
have to be clothed in something. They're clothed in Minnie-type clothing to 
create a visual look. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to say, 'I need to get this specific item.' It's like any 
rock video that uses certain clothing or props." All the polka-dotted bedroom 
accessories, decorations and clothing, Jaffee said, "created the look we wanted 
to convey on Minnie Street." 
</P>
<P>
Material manifestations of the Minnie lifestyle will be available for purchase 
in stunning variety, however. More than 50 "Minnie 'n Me" licensees are selling 
everything from clothing to sunglasses, stationery, bags, wallpaper, rugs, 
dinnerware, backpacks, posters, buttons, jewelry, toys and more. 
</P>
<P>
Minnie's "best friend," Christa Larson, who is scheduled to use her perky smile 
to promote the album during a round of national appearances, is the calm at the 
center of the publicity cyclone. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee described Christa as "natural," and indeed, although she's been in the 
spotlight since she was 5, Larson, who lives in Anaheim with her parents and an 
older sister, comes across as unspoiled and very much her age. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview, when asked how she felt about being a role model for 
her peers, she said, "I kind of like it. It makes you feel good about yourself 
when people look up to you." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl with the big voice and wide blue eyes doesn't think she wants 
to be in show business forever, however. Doing "Les Miserables" eight shows a 
week for two years was tiring, and even though "Minnie 'n Me" was a lot of fun 
-- "especially the dancing" -- Larson is "not sure I want to do this for the 
rest of my life. I've wanted to be an artist since I was little," she said, 
"and I also want to be a marine biologist." 
</P>
<P>
She was hesitant when asked for advice for girls her age, but after a moment's 
consideration offered, "Have fun and be yourself. Try to reach your goals in 
life, keep trying, never give up, and be good to each other." 
</P>
<P>
But despite Christa Larson's engaging presence in "Minnie 'n Me," it's Mickey's 
familiar female friend who gets top billing. The album represents Disney's 
intent to develop new children's artists, rather than focusing solely on 
recordings tied to Disney movies and cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
"Christa is our first recording artist," Jaffee said. But, "we're in the 
process of signing a number of children's artists who are not children. In 
essence, we're creating music that we think satisfies the needs of the 
audience."

The body of an unidentified man was found floating in a Trabuco Canyon 
reservoir early this morning, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how long the man had been floating face down in the middle of 
the reservoir near Trabuco Canyon Road and Plano Trabuco Road, Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
But he may have accidentally drowned while swimming in the reservoir sometime 
last night, Olson said. The 250-by-100-foot reservoir is used to supply water 
to a local nursery. 
</P>
<P>
A pile of clothing and personal belongings were found nearby at about 7 a.m. 
today, Olson said.

BURBANK MAN SLAIN IN DRIVEWAY

<P>
A Burbank man was fatally shot this morning by two gunmen who were waiting for 
him when he and his wife drove into a parking space outside their apartment, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Salazar, 37, was shot once in the head as he sat in his car in the 700 
block of East Cedar Avenue about 12:30 a.m., said Sgt. Don Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
He died an hour later at St. Joseph Medical Center. His wife, Cecilia, was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had no motive for the slaying, Goldberg said. The victim was 
returning home after being picked up from work by his wife in the Echo Park 
area of Los Angeles. When they arrived at their apartment, two men approached 
the car and fired at the victim before fleeing. Goldberg said it appears the 
gunmen were waiting specifically for Salazar.

<P>
An automobile overturned on a Canoga Park street this morning, killing the 
driver and leaving a passenger unhurt, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 3:50 a.m. in the 8500 block of Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard, and the victim, whose identity was not known, died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Leona Thomas said the car was headed south when the driver reached 
across the dashboard to adjust the radio and the car went out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The car hit the center dividing curb, crossed back over the southbound lanes, 
hit a light poll and overturned on the front lawn of a house. The male driver 
suffered fatal head injuries, but the male passenger, who also was not 
identified, was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is being investigated further, Thomas said.

<P>
Continental Airlines was fined $101,050 today after pleading no contest to 
violating air pollution laws by improperly handling ozone-depleting chemicals 
at a Los Angeles International Airport maintenance facility. 
</P>
<P>
The airline was also placed on three years' informal probation by Municipal 
Court Judge Susan Isacoff. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed after the airline pleaded no contest to 20 health and 
safety code violations of South Coast Air Quality Management District rules. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Teresa Lujan said the charges grew out of violations 
discovered during inspections in April and May, 1989, at the Continental 
maintenance facility where airplanes are stripped and repainted. During the 
stripping process, the airline utilized equipment that used hazardous chemicals 
without permits and in violation of permit requirements.

Richard Miller, the only FBI agent ever charged with espionage, betrayed his 
country by passing secret documents to his Soviet lover out of lust and "to 
make a quick buck," a prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not begin his (FBI) career to become a spy. But he did become a spy," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff said in opening Miller's third trial on 
espionage and bribery charges. Miller allegedly delivered an FBI intelligence 
manual in 1984 to the Soviet emigre with whom he had an adulterous affair and 
believed was an agent of the Soviet spy agency, the KGB.

The mountain gorilla will be extinct by the end of the century if action is not 
taken now to protect it, Rwandan Foreign Minister Casmir Bizimungu told an 
international conference on gorillas, official Radio Rwanda reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong First International Gorilla Protection Fair opened Monday in 
Kigali, Rwanda, the tiny east African country that is home to most of the 
world's 310 mountain gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference is to broaden public awareness of the gorilla's 
plight, said the broadcast, monitored in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
"We must preserve the gorillas' natural habitat," Bizimungu said. "If urgent 
steps are not taken to protect mountain gorillas against poachers, they will no 
longer exist in Rwanda by the end of the century," the broadcast noted. 
</P>
<P>
The minister praised the work of American zoologist Dian Fossey, who dedicated 
her life to studying gorillas and protecting them from poachers. But he said 
such individual efforts are not enough.

A former top aide to U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh pleaded innocent today to 
drug-related charges that resulted from a federal investigation of alleged drug 
use by public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Barr, who worked for Thornburgh at the Justice Department and in 
Harrisburg when Thornburgh was Pennsylvania's governor, is apparently the 
highest-ranking present or former federal official to face drug charges, said 
Gordon Zubrod, the prosecutor in charge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Barr pleaded innocent to four counts during a brief hearing before U.S. 
District Judge Edwin Kosik. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, 47, of suburban Harrisburg, is charged with one count of cocaine 
possession, two counts of lying to federal officials about drug use and one 
count of conspiracy.

enyan man who did not bathe for three years met a soapy fate when an 
exasperated mob pursued him through the streets, peeled off his clothes and 
forcibly washed him in public, the semiofficial Kenya Times newspaper reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was withheld, was set upon by odor-sensitive colleagues 
after he repeatedly declined invitations to break his 36-month ablutionary 
fast, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow artisans in Othaya, 60 miles north of Nairobi, chased the pungent 
offender through the streets, held him down and scrubbed him with soap and a 
rough piece of gunnysack. The sacking helped remove the accumulated layers of 
filth, the paper explained. 
</P>
<P>
The man's clothes were burned, and he was given a new set after friends held a 
collection for him. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd also force-marched the man to a barber shop, where the victim had his 
hair cut and his beard trimmed.

Bremerton, Wash., today was rated as the "best place to live" in the United 
States in the fourth annual Money Magazine survey. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco placed third on the list, behind Seattle with Sacramento ninth 
and Los Angeles-Long Beach 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the top 10 places picked are in the Pacific Northwest or California. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, Allentown-Bethlehem, Pa., was ranked 300th. 
</P>
<P>
The survey pointed out that New England areas that comprised half of the top 10 
in 1989 "are among those that dipped in the rankings because of economic 
stagnation and depressed housing prices." 
</P>
<P>
Nashua, N.H., 1987's winner, slipped to 133rd this year. Danbury, Conn., 1988's 
winner, was listed as 66th. 
</P>
<P>
Bremerton, about 15 miles southwest of Seattle across Puget Sound with a 
population of 180,900, was hailed as a "super-burb" -- "a medium-size, safe, 
environmentally clean place, with a rebounding economy." 
</P>
<P>
In the survey, Money asked a representative sampling of subscribers to rate the 
importance of such regional characteristics as weather, crime, clean air, 
taxes, medical care, cultural attractions and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"Interest in the local environment figured significantly this year, and a low 
crime rate was the second most important consideration," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it added that "high marks were given to areas with the least cyclic 
economies." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing up the rear with Allentown-Bethlehem was Waterbury, Conn., 296th; 
Pawtucket, R.I., 297th; New Britain, Conn., 298th, and Fall River, Mass., 299th 
. 
</P>
<P>
Of other major cities, New York was rated 28th; Boston, 15th; Chicago, 30th; 
Detroit, 92nd; St. Louis, 172nd; Philadelphia, 140th; Pittsburgh, 111th; 
Baltimore, 39th; Miami 63rd; Denver, 137th; Atlanta, 156th; New Orleans, 18th.

An estimated 800,000 Proctor-Silex automatic drip coffee makers are being 
recalled because they pose a potential fire hazard, the company and the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor-Silex said it had received 181 reports of fire involving the coffee 
maker, which was manufactured in 1985 and 1986 and sold by Sears and J. C. 
Penney outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Owners should unplug the coffee makers and stop using them, the company and 
safety agency said in a news release. The coffee makers are not repairable, the 
release said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which will issue a new coffee maker for each recalled appliance, 
said thermostats and fuses may overheat, possibly causing a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the recalled coffee makers are asked to call a toll-free number, 
1-800-341-3333, to verify that their appliance is included and to learn how to 
return them and obtain reimbursement for shipping.

<P>
Stock prices tumbled again today after an early attempt to rally fizzled out. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in early trading, 
fell 43.81 points to 2,560.15, extending its loss since July 17 to 439.60 
points, or 14.65%. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues swamped advances by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 360 up, 1,202 down and 426 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 175.55 million shares, against 194.63 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index dropped 2.72 to 174.22. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the showdown in the Middle East continued to spread through 
world markets as the session progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks have attracted a few sporadic buyers in recent days, apparently spurred 
by hopes that the markets might have gone to extremes in their appraisal of the 
potential ripple effects of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But a good many analysts questioned whether the market has fully adjusted to 
the increased recession risks arising from the situation in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Stock markets in other financial centers around the world remain on the 
defensive amid fears of increased inflationary pressures and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The price of oil, which hovered around $16 a barrel at the start of the summer, 
climbed past $30. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by such developments as the sharp rise in oil prices, Wall Streeters 
have curtailed their hopes for a recovery any time soon in U.S. corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slipped in early trading today as oil prices continued to climb, 
heightening inflationary concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 face 
amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.98% from 8.94% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story -- oil up, bonds down," said Mike Geraty, a government 
bond trader with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was little other news to affect trading, which he described as 
sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged to 5/32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell 7/32 point to 
5/16 point, and long-term issues were down as much as 7/16 point, according to 
Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Brothers daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.19 to 1,142.14. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.80% as the discount fell 2 basis 
points to 7.55%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.85% as the discount fell 1 
basis point to 7.46%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.88% as the discount 
rose 1 basis point to 7.37%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7 15/16%, up from 7 7/8% late Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia canceled most exports of refined oil products today as the U.S. 
war machine began drying up regional supplies of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia told customers in the Far East and elsewhere that their September 
contract loadings of gasoline, kerosene and gas oil would not be met because of 
the "current difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources said naphtha and fuel oil were not affected. The kingdom 
has contracts to supply more than 300,000 barrels a day of refined products, 
mainly in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, the United States has built up a 
massive arsenal of tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, helicopters and aircraft in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"The crude is there, and they have enough refineries in Saudi Arabia to produce 
most of the military needs," an oil industry executive in the gulf said. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries in Bahrain, Qatar and Abu Dhabi also export products, but it was not 
immediately clear if these sales would also stop. 
</P>
<P>
Oil traders in the Persian Gulf said most product exports from the area, which 
fell by 600,000 barrels a day when Kuwait's refineries closed, could stop 
altogether.

TENSIONS PUSH CRUDE FUTURES TO $30 A BARREL;

<P>
The rising tensions in the Middle East continued to push up wholesale energy 
prices -- with crude oil jumping above $30 a barrel in futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-afternoon trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October 
contract for West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark grade of U.S. crude -- 
was up $1.30, to $30.01. 
</P>
<P>
The September contract for unleaded gasoline gained 2.44 cents, to $1.035 a 
gallon, while home heating oil shot up 5.79 cents, to 89.50 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices edged higher in London on crisis jitters today. North Sea Brent 
crude oil for October delivery was valued at $27.90 a barrel at midday, up from 
Tuesday's $27.10. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some cargoes were transferred and tankers were being reflagged to 
avoid economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish oil company Compania Espanola de Petroleo SA said it planned to 
transfer 126,000 tons of Nigerian crude oil from a barred Iraqi-flagged tanker 
to another ship to allow the oil to be imported to a Canary Island refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's merchant marine had barred the Iraqi-flagged Almuntanabbi from Spanish 
ports Monday, but a spokesman said today that the department agreed to the 
transfer of the Nigerian crude to a "neutral" ship. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-flagged Triden Arrow, blocked Saturday by Spain from unloading 
1,000 tons of Brazilian cotton in Barcelona, switched to the Liberian flag 
Tuesday and was permitted to unload. 
</P>
<P>
Six members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were 
considering holding an informal meeting this weekend to discuss the turmoil in 
the oil markets caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, sources close to the cartel 
said today in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suggested that six of the 13 OPEC members gather in Vienna on Sunday 
to examine the situation, according to the sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that no final decision had yet been made on whether to 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It may or may not be held," one source said. "If it is, it will be very, very 
informal." No decisions could be made at the gathering, he said.

A first-division English soccer team was warned today that it could be expelled 
if there is another incident of fan violence similar to the one that 
accompanied a victory in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Football Assn., English soccer's governing body, said it would revoke Leeds 
United's membership as "the ultimate sanction." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a likely scenario, but it is a possible scenario," said David 
Bloomfield, the FA's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Leeds fans rampaged through Bournemouth, England, before, during 
and after a victory that clinched the club's promotion to Division 1 in the 
season's final game.

HOLTZ DENIES KNOWING OF IRISH STEROID USE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: NOTRE DAME SAYS FIVE TESTED POSITIVE IN THREE YEARS, REFUTES BITTER 
ALLEGATIONS BY FORMER PLAYER.

<P>
Notre Dame said today five football players have tested positive for steroid 
use in the past three years, but Coach Lou Holtz denied published allegations 
by a former player that steroid use was widespread and that he must have known 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I totally deny unequivocally everything that was written," Holtz said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied allegations in a Sports Illustrated story written by former 
Irish lineman Steve Huffman that two assistant coaches suggested players use 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal said the players who tested positive were 
disciplined. He declined to identify them or to say whether any of them were 
dismissed from the football program or from school. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the five players who had positive tests were permitted to compete in 
games while steroids were in their system," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that printing this article with Notre Dame not absolutely having a 
chance to participate or respond to the false charges is unfair, unprofessional 
and journalistically irresponsible," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who had two brothers who starred as linemen at Notre Dame, claimed in 
this week's Sports Illustrated, that "almost half the lettermen at Notre Dame 
used steroids at some time." He also said some players sold the muscle-building 
drug, which is banned by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said he wrote the SI article because of what Holtz said about him in 
his 1989 book, "The Fighting Spirit: A Championship Season at Notre Dame." In 
the book, Holtz said Huffman let down his teammates by quitting the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be going public with the way I feel about Holtz and his program if 
he hadn't gone public about me," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman had an injury-plagued career at Notre Dame before quitting the team 
during preseason practice in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although Huffman doesn't accuse Holtz of encouraging steroid use, he claims the 
coach failed to take a strong stand against the drugs, which are known to have 
dangerous side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that other players say that Holtz directly warned them not to use 
steroids, but I never heard it," said the 6-foot-5, 270-pound Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever heard him say was, 'Be careful with steroids.' Whenever I was 
around, that's all he ever said."

Los Angeles Rams offensive tackle Jackie Slater ended his four-week holdout 
today and began preparations for his 15th season with the team. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams would not say whether Slater had successfully renegotiated his 
contract or whether the six-time Pro Bowl player would be fined. The NFL 
maximum fine for a holdout is $1,500 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, was upset with his reported $550,000 salary for the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
The team was left with four holdouts -- linebacker Kevin Greene, defensive end 
Doug Reed, tight end Damone Johnson and safety Michael Stewart.

The last holdout has signed with the Phoenix Cardinals, and that means there 
will be competition between two rookie running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jensen of the NFL team said Anthony Thompson, a second-round draft pick 
from Indiana and the 1989 Heisman Trophy runner-up, signed today and was 
expected in training camp on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Bowl safety Tim McDonald ended his 29-day holdout by signing a three-year 
contract Tuesday and promptly reporting for training. 
</P>
<P>
So far in preseason, ninth-round draft pick Johnny Johnson has been Phoenix's 
starting running back and has a team-leading 121 yards on 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"He's opening everybody's eyes," Coach Joe Bugel said of Johnson, who is one of 
San Jose State's all-time leading rushers. Having both Thompson and Johnson 
will "only help because it will be two rookies pushing each other for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the Thompson contract weren't disclosed, but he had been seeking a 
two-year deal at $1.3 million, about $200,000 more than the team reportedly was 
offering.

Vicki Goetze of Hull, Ga., opened her bid to win a record third PGA Junior

year, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
Couch, the youngest player to compete in a PGA Tour event when he qualified for 
the Honda Classic last March, had five birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters from Albuquerque, N.M., were second in both divisions. Kerry Zebick

Chicago Bears rookie running back Johnny Bailey paid an outstanding fine of 
about $1,400 shortly after a prosecutor said he could go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had outstanding fines and fees of about $1,400 from a 1986 drug 
conviction, Harris County Assistant Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey paid the fine Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Stabe told Bailey's attorney, Robert Bennett, that if Bailey didn't 
appear in court by Friday, he would be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bailey has paid the fine, Stabe said he is still due in court Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, college football's all-time leading rusher from Texas A&amp;I, also has 
failed to report to a probation officer seven times in the past three years, 
Stabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Stabe said he does not anticipate having to revoke Bailey's probation. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he will call Illinois authorities if he has to. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's not here on the 31st, I'll not have any problem with having him 
arrested," he said.

Ron Kovic, the disabled Vietnam veteran played by Tom Cruise in the movie "Born 
on the Fourth of July" appealed for President Bush to bring troops home from 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on television from his beach city home, Kovic on Tuesday said he would 
send his opinions to Bush in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I implore the President to begin withdrawing the troops," the former Marine 
said during a newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, 43, whose autobiography served as the source for "Fourth of July" said 
he represented millions of people uneasy about an American military operation 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a growing movement," he said, saying that an opinion shift would occur 
as soon as American troops suffer casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of us want peace," he said. "We've had enough of wars. We've had 
enough of our sons coming home in body bags and wheelchairs. We've had enough 
of delayed stress syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic served with the Marines in Vietnam and lost the use of his legs from a 
combat wound. He returned to America and eventually became an anti-war 
activist.

AT LONG LAST, ENGELBERT TO SCRATCH ACTING ITCH

One glance at Engelbert Humperdinck's tour itinerary would make it easy to 
believe that he runs in the circles of the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
A few shows in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of nights in Hawaii. Back to Atlantic City for a week. It all sounds 
like an ideal lifestyle for a world-renowned performer who is still living off 
a pack of hit songs from the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Humperdinck is working very hard to change that image of the Vegas 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
Humperdinck departs soon for Luxembourg and an acting part in a miniseries 
called "Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady," which stars Morgan Fairchild. In 
November, after some more concerts, Humperdinck and Fairchild will team up 
again for work in Florida on a feature film called "Point Blank," which will be 
released in theaters early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty difficult tackling both right now," Humperdinck said. "It's like a 
cramming situation in school where you're trying to learn your lines and keep 
the shows going at a high level. But I believe that hard work brings out the 
best in you when you're pushed." 
</P>
<P>
Humperdinck, whose only other role of any note was in a "Fantasy Island" 
episode eight years ago, said he had always wanted to dabble in acting but his 
management would not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be an actor from the word go -- since 1967 when it all started," 
Humperdinck said. "But my company kept me on the road constantly because I'm a 
moneymaker for them. These acting roles mean a big drop in income, but I'm 
certainly willing to do that to have the opportunity to do what I've always 
longed to do."

Universal Studios Florida has sued the designer of "Jaws" and "Earthquake -- 
The Big One," two highly touted thrill rides that have been shut down except 
for brief periods since the park's June 7 opening. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Orange County (Fla.) 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Court against Ride &amp; Show Engineering Inc. of San Dimas, Calif., 
claims the company used poor design and workmanship on the rides and failed to 
have them operating by the grand opening of the $630-million studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
Ride &amp; Show Engineering plans to fight the suit and is considering a 
counterclaim against the theme park, said Joseph B. McHugh, the firm's vice 
president of marketing and administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly disagree with Universal's claims," McHugh said. "Except for the 
expense of litigation, we welcome the chance to vindicate our company."

OPERA CANCELS ALL ORCHESTRA REHEARSALS 
</P>

With less than three weeks before the Sept. 7 opening of its 1990 season, the 
San Francisco Opera has canceled all orchestra rehearsals until a contract 
settlement is reached with the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The opera sent all 69 orchestra musicians letters telling them not to show up 
at today's scheduled first day of rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's three-year contract expired Sunday at midnight. Earlier in the 
day, the musicians unanimously rejected their employer's latest offer. Talks 
broke down early Monday after orchestra negotiators made a counteroffer during 
a late-night session. 
</P>
<P>
"By canceling the rehearsals, the Opera is putting the upcoming season in 
jeopardy," said clarinetist Joanne Eisler, chairman of the Opera orchestra's 
negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
She said the musicians are confused by the Opera's move because, "We weren't at 
an impasse. We were making some movement, and we didn't feel the two sides were 
that far apart." 
</P>
<P>
The main issue is money. Opera musicians now make a base salary of $40,000 a 
year for the 23-week season. They want partial parity with the San Francisco 
Symphony, whose musicians make a base salary of $57,000 for 42 weeks of work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Opera orchestra played all its preseason rehearsals without a 
contract, approving the final offer just 10 minutes before the dress rehearsal 
of "The Barber of Seville," the night before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
This time, no rehearsals will be scheduled until a new contract is settled, 
said Opera spokesman Jon Finck.

FRANCINE BROWNER IS BIG IN L.A.'S JUNIOR MARKET, THE 'MOST CREATIVE IN THE 
U.S.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Yorks, a free-lance writer, regularly contributes to 
The Times' fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cheshire cat grin creeps across Francine Browner's face as she confesses that 
the jacket she wears does not carry her own label. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Calvin Klein," the 44-year-old sportswear designer admits, adding that 
she has not "interpreted" its look and feel into her own line. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
Klein is one of several top names in the business who inspire Browner's designs 
for Rue de Reves, a company she founded six years ago and has built into a 
leader among Southern California's junior market. 
</P>
<P>
But there is at least one major difference between Browner and those who 
inspire her. She strives for a $100-per-outfit retail price. They get about 10 
times that. 
</P>
<P>
"We go for the look and then we work on the prices," she says. "We go for the 
best garment we can get within our price range." 
</P>
<P>
The approach has paid off. She claimed $75 million in retail sales last year, 
and experts rank her company among the best in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is the most important market for junior and contemporary fashion 
right now," says Mona Danford, co-owner of Directives West, a Los Angeles-based 
buyer service company. "Rue de Reves is one of the few large companies besides 
Esprit and Generra to garner a lion's share of it." 
</P>
<P>
New York-based fashion forecaster Pat Tunsky suggests that Los Angeles' junior 
market rates so high because "it is the most creative in the U.S. The designers 
aren't always playing it safe, letting themselves be dictated to by economic 
factors." Designers here are more willing to gamble on unproven trends, Tunsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Browner launched her business in December, 1984, she aimed her 
collections toward a silent-majority segment of women's ready-to-wear 
customers. She targeted women like herself, in their 30s, old enough to have a 
career but physically fit, fiscally limited and young-spirited enough to 
appreciate the junior department. 
</P>
<P>
This was a break from the traditional profile that said a junior-wear shopper 
was a teen-ager or a college-age woman. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real uphill battle trying to get the stores to realize that adult 
women are junior customers, too," Browner says. "We pretty much created the 
(contemporary juniors) department, but it was tough teaching the buyers about 
what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Browner's business now includes Hearts, a junior dress line, Hearts II, a 
junior plus-size label, D'Knits, for knit separates, and several signature 
lines, including one for petites, one for plus-size separates and one for 
dressier separates, called Workables. 
</P>
<P>
It was her father who introduced her to the fashion world. He worked for Bobbie 
Brooks, a pioneering junior label, then started his own business with a 
showroom in Manhattan, where Browner maintains a space. Like other girls, she 
made doll clothes. But art was her first love. Before attending New York's 
Parson's School of Design, she spent a year at Syracuse University studying 
fine art. Her father kept nudging her toward fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought designers had great jobs and made a lot of money," she explains. 
But "it wasn't until I got in the work force and had to make a real living that 
I was happy he had done that." 
</P>
<P>
She worked briefly for Personal Sportswear, a division of Leslie Fay, but after 
marriage, quit to have children. Seven years later, as a 32-year-old divorcee 
and mother of two daughters, she was faced with re-entering the work force. 
</P>
<P>
She held a garage sale, sold most of her possessions and in 1977 moved to 
California to seek work. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into the design community again was no easy feat -- particularly in a 
new city. 
</P>
<P>
She remembers a job interview at Organically Grown, the natural-fiber advocates 
of the junior sportswear industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I knew what I was doing, but later I realized I had no idea," she 
said. "I hadn't worked in years, but when they asked me pointed questions about 
what I could do, I automatically said yes, because I had two kids I had to 
support and I was going to get this job." 
</P>
<P>
She got the job. 
</P>
<P>
In time, she decided to start her own design firm. She drove a beat-up car and 
socked away savings. She found herself trying to dress well on a very tight 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
That's when it dawned on her: She was to be her own customer. 
</P>
<P>
When she and Neil Afromsky, now her business as well as her life partner, 
launched Rue de Reves, her concept came alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I design for a young-spirited woman who could be 18 or 40 who's on a budget," 
Browner says. "I have a real affinity for her because I was in her shoes. A 
woman goes into a store, looks at my price tag and is shocked because she can 
afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Fleming, who wears Browner fashions on ABC's "Home" show, says the 
affordability was important when Browner's clothes were selected as one of her 
main wardrobe sources for on-air wear. Because Fleming's hosting duties require 
unpredictable movement, she likes the walking-short ensembles in her spring and 
summer lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Viewers are watching the show to find out ways to keep from spending a lot of 
money," says Fleming, who estimates that she has received hundreds of letters 
about the clothes she wears on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming says that what she likes most about the clothes is the subtle way 
Browner interprets trends. 
</P>
<P>
"She never copies anything exactly," Fleming says. "Francine is influenced by 
trends just enough to keep the clothes current, but she's fresh enough to keep 
everything interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Although Calvin Klein jackets are now a luxury she can afford, Browner isn't 
consumed with making her line more upscale. Neither is she interested in 
returning to the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is really where junior fashion is developing," she says. "People come 
here with an entrepreneurial spirit, and that youthful attitude is reflected in 
the garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of clothes that are designed here are free of limitations. They are 
by and for people who are open to new possibilities. Whether they want to be in 
the film or the fashion industry, that spirit allows them to reach for their 
dreams."
