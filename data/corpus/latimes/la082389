AGENT IS ACCUSED OF RECKLESSNESS IN BOY'S BORDER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer representing the family of a boy killed by a U. S. Border Patrol 
vehicle charged Tuesday that the agent behind the wheel acted recklessly and 
was driving at high speed when the youth was run over early Sunday along the 
U.S.-Mexican border in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys should have been paying more attention and should not have been so 
reckless with the vehicle," said attorney Michael D. Padilla of San Diego. The 
family plans to pursue a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against the border 
agency, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, however, have maintained that the incident was an unavoidable 
accident that occurred when the boy, Luis Eduardo Hernandez Hernandez, 14, 
stumbled in front of the vehicle, which a Border Patrol spokesman said was 
traveling at a safe speed between 10 and 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"The agent had no time to react," said Michael D. Gregg, a spokesman for the 
Border Patrol, a uniformed enforcement arm of the U. S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
But Padilla, citing comments by the dead boy's brother, who he said witnessed 
the incident, charged that the vehicle was traveling "extremely fast," although 
he declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cannot Place a Life in Danger' 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also said that the offense committed by the youth -- illegal entry 
into the United States -- did not merit a life-threatening response. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the crime is such that you cannot place a life in danger," 
Padilla said. "You don't kill someone for illegal entry. They may as well have 
pulled a gun out and shot him." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating the incident. The inquiry should take about 
two weeks, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred at 2 a.m Sunday, has prompted debate about the 
driving tactics used by patrol guards in the border zone, particularly in the 
area west of the San Ysidro port of entry along the Tijuana River levees, where 
the boy was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the agents' method 
</P>
<P>
of vehicular patrol at the levees make such deaths inevitable -- an assertion 
denied by officials. 
</P>
<P>
The elevated flood-control levees have become perhaps the single most 
concentrated illicit crossing area along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico 
border, drawing hundreds of prospective border-jumpers nightly. 
</P>
<P>
They gather at a variety of spots, massing in groups atop the levees or at 
dozens of holes in the tattered fence that marks the international boundary. 
Closely observing them is an array of waiting all-terrain Border Patrol 
vehicles, which U.S. authorities say serves as the first line of defense in the 
effort to deter illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightly game of cat and mouse, the agents frequently cruise back and 
forth along the unpaved southern base of the south levee, often kicking up 
thick clouds of dust that drift into the adjoining Tijuana neighborhood and 
obscure the major Mexican roadway that leads to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
On recent evenings, Border Patrol vehicles have been observed traveling at 
speeds that appeared to exceed 30 m.p.h., often passing close to darting 
migrants, whose presence in the darkness is often further obscured by the 
swirling dust churned up by the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bound to Happen Eventually' 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of death was just bound to happen eventually," said Roberto 
Martinez, a longtime rights activist who is the border representative in San 
Diego for the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of the 
Quaker Church. 
</P>
<P>
"I think an accident like this could have been foreseen," said Marcela Merino, 
an official with the Mexican consulate general in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The consulate, Merino said, has received complaints about the thick dust kicked 
up by the vehicles and has informed U. S. officials of the danger stemming from 
the reduced visibility -- both to migrants running in the path of the patrol 
vehicles and to motorists and pedestrians using the heavily traveled adjacent 
Mexican highway. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Gregg said he had not heard about the complaints and 
could not comment on them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inevitable Byproduct 
</P>
<P>
Calling the dust an inevitable byproduct of the agents' constant patrols in the 
area, Gregg said: "Our agents don't like breathing the dust any more than the 
aliens do." 
</P>
<P>
The agents' vehicles occasionally exceed 15 m.p.h., Gregg said, especially when 
responding to emergency calls from other agents. But he added that safety is 
put at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
"You travel at the speed you believe is safest," said Gregg, who has extensive 
experience in the levee area. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicular patrols are intended to serve as a "visible deterrent" to the 
undocumented border crossers, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, however, charged that the agent who was driving the Chevrolet Blazer 
that hit the youth "was using the vehicle to harass and intimidate these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Border Patrol account, the boy was hit when he stumbled in 
front of the vehicle early Sunday morning. He was part of a group of about 100 
undocumented border crossers, Gregg said. The boy and his brother, Angel, 15, 
were on their way to Los Angeles to visit their father, Aurelio Hernandez 
Martin, a construction worker who is a legal U.S. resident, Padilla said.

FIELD OF SCREAMS: WITH LUCK, IT WON'T SHOW WHO WAS ON 1ST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If grass could sing, "See me, feel me, touch me" are lyrics that the tenants of 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- the Chargers, Padres and Aztecs -- wish could 
be reserved only for them. 
</P>
<P>
But in a publicly owned stadium, the sports teams have to share. And Tuesday 
night, the field was reserved for the legendary British band The Who, whose 
last visit to San Diego marked the beginning of an unofficial six-year ban on 
rock concerts at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
On that night in 1983, the field lay exposed to thousands of rowdy fans, who 
danced and pranced on its tender grass. Afterward, Don Coryell, then the coach 
of the Chargers, said it was the worst playing field he had seen in several 
decades of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
The '83 show was also a security nightmare. Dozens of people were arrested and 
dozens more taken to hospitals with major and minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night much had changed, although the San Diego Police Department 
reported more than 50 arrests, mostly for drunk-and-disorderly conduct. 
Paramedics and nurses working the first-aid stations said it was actually a 
slow night for them, in contrast to the turmoil of both The Who's '83 show and 
an appearance by the Rolling Stones in 1981. (By 10:15 p.m., only four people 
had been taken to hospitals -- with minor injuries.) 
</P>
<P>
And the key factor -- did the city make money or not? -- may have been revealed 
at the gate. A spokeswoman for The Who, who asked not to be quoted by name, 
said that by 9 p.m., the crowd was "somewhere between 42,000 and 43,000." 
</P>
<P>
Stadium manager Bill Wilson said Tuesday that the only reason rock is worth the 
risk is because of the large payoff it brings the city. The Stones show, which 
drew more than 70,000 fans, is said to have netted more 
</P>
<P>
than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"For this one, we're hoping for a net between $150,000 and $225,000," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the field, a high-tech "geotextile" material was laid down before 
the show. (The baseball infield was kept off limits from the crowd.) The 8,400 
seats on the field were sold only on a reserved basis, and police officers 
confined the feet of each potential dancer to the top of his seat. 
</P>
<P>
For the Stones' '81 show and The Who's '83 show, Wilson said, as many as 20,000 
people were allowed on the field in what is known as "festival seating." He 
said the only way rock will be allowed at the stadium in the future, by mandate 
of the Stadium Authority Board, is with "no festival seating." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the geotextile material had been stripped away in some places Tuesday 
night, and cigarette butts and other debris was ground into the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Teele, director of administration for the Chargers, said Tuesday he is 
"concerned" about the field, despite the precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to take a wait-and-see attitude," he said. "We've got nine 
games to play on that field. Our whole schedule is in front of us, so we hope 
it isn't damaged. We hope it's in good shape for the rest of the season, but, 
at this point, it's only hope. Our lease agreement assures us of a field in top 
condition, so we expect it to be in top condition." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he expects only "slight discoloration" on the field and mostly in 
the area near the scoreboard, where the stage was set up. He said he hopes that 
rock can continue at the stadium, because it brings money the city "can ill 
afford" to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Falletti, 26, an engineer for an aerospace firm, said she agreed with 
Wilson. She said the six-year suspension of stadium rock -- that is, big-band 
rock that allowed seating on the field -- was too long and was partly a 
reflection of San Diego's "provincialism." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like everybody prepared for it well," she said. "The music is great, 
the crowd is great, and I think everyone here would be willing to bear the 
added cost of having to fit the stadium with protective measures like this 
covering on the field. I know I wouldn't mind." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was thrilled with Tuesday's show. Several dozen people were 
offering up an obscene chant outside a ticket window shortly before lead singer 
Roger Daltrey took the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Hock, 19, of Oceanside said he and his friends had bought seats on the 
field only to find when they reported to their section -- Section 40 -- that it 
did not exist. They were offered seats in the stadium's upper level, but not 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"91X (XTRA-FM, the radio station promoting the concert) really screwed this 
thing up," Hock said. "We pay all this money for tickets, and then have this 
happen."

You may recall that a month ago, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce forced 
Newhall's Downtown Western Walk of Fame to change its name to the Walk of 
Western Stars. The chamber, ever-vigilant lest Newhall become the world's 
entertainment capital, explained that it had copyrighted the phrase, "Walk of 
Fame." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . Hollywood types are known for showing favoritism toward relatives. 
</P>
<P>
And, today, a sister city of Los Angeles -- Nagoya, Japan -- should pass the 
final hurdle to achieve its dream of installing its own Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Department's Board of Commissioners is expected to 
approve a $60,000 expenditure to supply 25 prefabricated stars (celebrities 
haven't yet been designated), with Hollywood's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
The Walk of Clones is intended to salute the 30th anniversary of the 
sister-city relationship, as well as Nagoya's centennial. "We were trying to 
find something very truly American and certainly very truly Hollywood, very Los 
Angeles," said Julia Nagano, a Harbor Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Walk, incidentally, will be housed in a section of Nagoya called Los 
Angeles Square. No doubt it will come to be known as Little L.A. 
</P>
<P>
We've got everything from Dial-a-Pizza to Dial-a-Prayer. It was only a matter 
of time before the arrival of . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dial-A-Planet. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, space buffs will be able to receive up-to-the-minute details of 
Voyager's rendezvous with Neptune as the data is received and interpreted by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of making the call (1-900-909-NASA) is $2 for the first minute and 45 
cents for each additional minute. The service will be available from 6 a.m. 
Thursday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Then, Dial-a-Planet's line goes dead until 
another area code in the solar system can be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
When a guy's determined, really determined, to BUILD THAT PATIO, he'll pick up 
the supplies even if his car is disabled. For example, there was Al Fisher of 
Eagle Rock the other day, precariously balancing a beam on one shoulder as he 
made the uphill trip home from the lumberyard on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows if it'll ever assume its proposed position above the Hollywood 
Freeway. But a model of the proposed $33-million "Steel Cloud" -- seen by its 
backers as the West Coast's Statue of Liberty -- is on display this month at 
street level in the City Hall East lobby. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time. Like many a controversial production, "Cloud" opened out of 
town -- in a San Francisco exhibit hall earlier this year, where it was 
described as everything from "a jungle gym for adults" to a symbol of "the 
fragmentary character" of society. 
</P>
<P>
The miniature features such attractions as museums, restaurants and aquariums. 
It's also decorated with tiny plastic palm trees (a nice L.A. touch), 
pedestrians and fewer cars than Mel Gibson encounters in the 
post-nuclear-war-era film, "The Road Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
Crescencio Rodriguez drives the real streets of Los Angeles for a living, so 
his opponents in the International Bus Roadeo may argue that he's had an unfair 
advantage learning to avoid traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Rodriguez, an RTD driver on the Wilshire Boulevard line, will 
represent Southern California in the safe-driving finals Sept. 26 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
He beat out 31 finalists in the district competition in the parking lot of the 
Santa Anita Race Track, where he was asked to negotiate a series of mazes 
featuring traffic cones and barrels. The lot was first cleared of its usual 
hazards, race track touts. 
</P>
<P>
It's been an odd year for folks in the Elysian Park area. Forty Medflies were 
discovered earlier this month near Dodger Stadium. And, for months before that, 
the anemic Dodger hitters have also been producing plenty of pop flies.

SUPERVISORS OK PALOMAR AIRPORT COMMUTER FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to grant an operating permit 
to a subsidiary of Pan Am Airlines to run commuter flights between 
McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad and Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Commuter, which plans to begin service Sept. 25, will be limited to six 
takeoffs a day and may operate only between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., under the terms 
of the permit. The Orange County-based company has also agreed to use Stage 3 
aircraft, classified as among the quietest airplanes made, and to do 
maintenance work at its facility at John Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Commuter will pay a $750-a-month permit fee that will be used to support 
and maintain the county-run airport, Airport Manager Rick Severson said. The 
fee will also allow the airline to use an existing ticket counter in the lobby 
building, which has been unused since the last commuter company folded in 1986, 
Severson said.

SUPERVISORS TO STUDY HOUSING INMATES IN SHIPPING CONTAINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing critical crowding in the existing county jails and a shortage of funds 
to build new ones, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to 
explore the possibility of housing inmates in tents and used shipping 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, with Supervisor Leon Williams absent, the board directed 
Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey to report back within a month on the 
feasibility of using tents, containers, wooden and metal trailers, and concrete 
and stucco assemblies in jail construction. 
</P>
<P>
"These may not be perfect solutions, but they are solutions," said Supervisor 
Susan Golding, who proposed the study. "We don't have any others right now." 
</P>
<P>
Golding acknowledged that the county's chief administrative office conducted a 
similar study in 1986. Many of the temporary housing alternatives considered 
then would have violated state laws, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Geometric Growth' 
</P>
<P>
But the "geometric growth" of jail population in the past three years dictates 
another look at temporary jail facilities, Golding said. As of Tuesday, county 
jails held 4,294 inmates, or 235% of their rated capacity, and Golding noted 
that a county forecast estimates that the number of inmates in San Diego jails 
will reach 15,950 by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal debated Tuesday is part of a broader, combined push by the city of 
San Diego and the county to change the state code regulating jail conditions 
and facilities. But Golding said it may be easier to secure a waiver for 
temporary jail housing than to actually change the laws, given Sacramento's 
strong resistance to wholesale changes in the rules governing permanent jails. 
</P>
<P>
If county officials determine that some of the alternative jail housing methods 
to be feasible, the board may ask the state to temporarily waive regulations 
that might prohibit their use, Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are building jails with single bunks to begin with (because of the state 
code) when we know we will need to triple- and quadruple- bunk anyway," she 
said. "Some of these (rules) have already been outpaced by reality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Rulings an Obstacle 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle in the way of cheap, quick solutions to jail crowding are 
court rulings declaring some jail facilities unconstitutional because they 
inflict cruel and unusual punishment on their occupants. One such ruling has 
already sunk a proposal to house inmates aboard mothballed Navy ships, 
according to Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials have already toured an Orange County facility and other 
inmate tent camps in their search for a way out of the jail crowding crisis, 
said sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Jim Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
At least one company has contacted the department in an effort to sell its 
corrugated steel containers as inmate housing, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't just erect a shipping container without windows or ventilation 
and expect people to live in it," Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke and Golding both noted that temporary jail facilities are most practical 
for low-security inmates. But, because the jails cannot accommodate most of 
those arrested on misdemeanor charges, felons who require tighter security 
account for much of the increase in inmate population, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is they just need to build more high-security jails," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Personnel Costs 
</P>
<P>
Temporary jail housing can increase personnel costs because more deputies are 
required to oversee such facilities, according to Cooke. As evidence, he 
pointed to increased manpower requirements at the men's wing of the County Jail 
at Las Colinas, the county's only temporary detention facility. 
</P>
<P>
In searching for inexpensive alternatives to conventional jails, Golding said 
she was inspired by the example of a 23-bed Leesburg County, Va., jail 
reportedly built in less than two weeks for less than $100,000. An Associated 
Press story describes the building, built with shipping containers, as 
resembling a schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
But another temporary jail facility built several years ago in Los Angeles 
"looked pretty oppressive," according to David Janssen, San Diego County's 
assistant chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody prefers a concentration camp-type solution," Janssen said.

<P>
The tragic death of Rep. Mickey Leland was a loss to the nation and to all who 
knew him. But we should also remember the others on that plane, who shared 
Congressman Leland's dedication to helping the needy of this world. Three of 
these, Tom and Roberta Worrick and Gladys Gilbert, were employees of the U.S. 
Agency for International Development (AID). 
</P>
<P>
These individuals symbolized the best in public service. They were not only 
skilled professionals but humanitarians, with long years of service in the 
poorest parts of Africa. Their deaths should remind us that we have courageous 
Americans in posts all over the world, quietly and persistently working for 
improvements in others' lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Worricks and Ms. Gilbert were not in Ethiopia by accident. They volunteered 
for duty there, knowing that it was dangerous and demanding. Doing relief work 
in Ethiopia is often like being in a war. It requires frequent hazardous 
flights, exposure to dangerous diseases in refugee camps, and living in 
primitive rural areas. The Worricks and Gilbert accepted the risks, because 
they wanted to be where the need is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
Each also had personal ties to Ethiopia. The Worricks had served as Peace Corps 
volunteers there 20 years before, and returned for special duty during the 
1984-85 famine. Mrs. Worrick was so fluent in the Amharic language that 
Ethiopians sometimes mistook her for a native on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert had sought out duty in the most difficult posts in Africa, first in the 
Ethiopian famine and then in Somalia. Colleagues remember that she was ecstatic 
the day she learned that she would be returning to Ethiopia for a long-term 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of people they were: generous, committed, and caring, 
representing the best of the American character. They don't come any better. We 
at AID salute Tom and Roberta Worrick and Gladys Gilbert. We honor them. And we 
mourn their passing.

SOLIDARITY'S MAJOR TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grumblings from Poland's Communist Party in recent days have sounded somewhat 
ominous. All the same, they are less threats to Solidarity's new position than 
sour grapes over the party's loss of position. The grumblings actually 
emphasize the fact that, in the course of a few weeks, Solidarity has become 
Poland's only political force with a mandate broad enough to lead a government. 
The party, therefore, "should stop rocking the boat," Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa scolded Tuesday, "and start doing its job." Their job, it seems, is to 
sit quietly in the back of the boat while Solidarity tries to chart a new 
course for the troubled country. 
</P>
<P>
This is no easy task, as Poles themselves recognize. Solidarity faces two sets 
of challenges, one technical, one social. The technical challenge is to 
adequately feed and clothe Poland's deprived population. Weighed down by a 
rotting infrastructure, little capital and $39 billion in foreign debt, 
Poland's economic difficulties are deepening. Western experts point out that 
solutions will require further cuts in wages and living standards. 
</P>
<P>
This is bound to precipitate a dilemma for Solidarity which, like other unions, 
tends to protect workers' wages and benefits at all costs. Cutting back on real 
income, whether through wage cuts, inflation or price reform, will be the most 
unpalatable aspect of the coming economic reforms. Anticipating this problem, 
Poland's newly designated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said Monday that 
"if we have to make a choice between efficiency and the interests which the 
union upholds, then we will refer to public opinion." But, he added, "if 
sacrifices are necessary, then people must accept them." 
</P>
<P>
The social challenge, consequently, is how to manage public discontent during 
this period of austerity. "We need bread, not a prime minister," a young Pole 
hollered at Mazowiecki during his first speech to the Polish people. Mazowiecki 
agreed with the heckler, but added that history "has shown in several moments 
that Poles can strive for new solutions, unusual and innovative ones. I hope 
that such a psychological moment is arriving now, that people will feel that 
there is a situation in which our future depends on us." In other words, the 
best thing going for Poland is her people's very hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
But hope could backfire on Solidarity. If hopes rise faster than realities, if 
expectations increase without any sign that they will be realized, observers 
fear that Solidarity will lose its social support. And that might spell the end 
of Poland's first popularly installed government since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
So while Solidarity is trying to find the right mixture of austerity and 
incentive, of hope and hardship, the United States must do all it possibly can 
to help out. President Bush promised a package of $100 million in aid and 
economic programs when he visited Poland in July. There were budget constraints 
then and there are budget questions now, but nonetheless the government must do 
what it can to give more. Aid cannot fix the economy, of course, but it can 
help ease the austerity. Domestic instability, which is more or less certain in 
the months to come, should not be cause for alarm in the Adminstration; after 
all, instability is the birthing pain of history. This is a historic time for 
Poland and for Europe. The least the United States can do is play its part.

AT LAST: A SOLUTION FOR MONO LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An extraordinary coalition has gathered in support of state legislation 
designed to buffer Mono Lake against the sort of water diversions that have 
reduced the area of the unique saline lake by more than 20 square miles over 
the past half century. The bills sponsored by Assemblymen Phil Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento) and William Baker (R-Danville) deserve quick approval by the 
California Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The measures establish a process by which at least $75 million would be made 
available to the City of Los Angeles to develop alternate water supplies. This 
new water would take the place of much of the flow the city Department of Water 
and Power has been taking from Sierra-based streams that historically fed into 
Mono Lake, near the town of Lee Vining at the foot of the Tioga Pass Road into 
Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
The city's right to take the water has been successfully challenged in court by 
the Mono Lake Committee, the Audubon Society and other environmental groups, 
including a major legal victory on Tuesday. In the Audubon case, the California 
Supreme Court first applied the public trust doctrine to state waterway 
environments, proclaiming that natural uses of the water can take precedence 
over the water rights of diverters. About one-seventh of Los Angeles' water 
supply has come from these streams. 
</P>
<P>
Among those supporting the Isenberg-Baker plan in Sacramento were the Mono Lake 
Committee, members of the Los Angeles City Council, the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense 
Fund and leaders of the legislative water committees. The legislation would 
establish a state environmental water fund, which gives Mono Lake its first 
priority for up to $75 million. Use of the money would be contingent on an 
agreement by the Mono Lake Committee and the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power limiting the city's diversions by a specific amount to maintain the 
lake at an agreed-upon level. The measures have passed the Assembly and are 
before the Senate's water committee for a hearing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The water and power department has been less enthusiastic about the program 
since the$75 million would make up for the loss of the Mono Lake water for a 
relatively short time. The city claims that it will lose water and power 
benefits worth $1.6 billion by 2020. The water flowing downhill through the Los 
Angeles Aqueduct also generates electricity sold by the city department. 
</P>
<P>
But now there is the prospect of federal assistance as well. Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) has written Baker to say that the federal government should help 
since the lake enjoys federal protection as a U.S. Forest Service national 
scenic area. When the state bill is approved, Wilson said, he will work with 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on legislation providing federal assistance to 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest threat to the state legislation now is a possible gubernatorial 
veto. The governor's Finance Department has opposed the financing mechanism 
involved, the use of $390 million in loans owed to the state by the state Water 
Project contractors. But the use of such funds for the preservation of an 
environmental public trust would be most appropriate. With the Administration's 
support, years of bitter legal dispute can be resolved in a manner in which 
everyone wins.

BLAST 'EM FROM THE SKIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD ENGEN, Donald Engen, a former head of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, is president of the Air Safety Foundation of the Aircraft 
Owners and Pilots Assn. His commentary is from the Washington Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sponsored a last-minute 
amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill. The McConnell amendment 
would authorize the shooting down of civil aircraft if a flying agent -- of the 
Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration or Customs Service -- concludes 
that the pilots do not intend to follow directions to land immediately. The 
amendment further would indemnify these agents from any responsibility for 
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) proposed a vote to kill that amendment. He found 
strong support from Sens. Sam Nunn, (D-Ga.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio), but the 
motion was defeated in a 45-55 roll-call vote. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner previously expressed his 
opposition and deep concern about this issue to William J. Bennett, director of 
the office of National Drug Control Policy. Still, the defense authorization 
bill with its McConnell amendment was passed in the Senate and will become law 
unless changed in conference between the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Great Jumping Jehosaphat! What is this country coming to that it would permit a 
drug agent of the Coast Guard, DEA or Customs Service, however well 
intentioned, to declare virtual war on any civil airplane that flies openly 
through our skies? 
</P>
<P>
Interpretation of intentions can be very inexact. Yet this provision would 
leave to the judgment of one enforcement person in the air whether or not to 
kill people -- perhaps a whole family returning from a business or pleasure 
trip abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way short of accurate intelligence to know what an airplane carries 
or who is on board. Fortunately, we do have some good intelligence. We need to 
get better. There are aviation regulations already in force that govern 
airplanes flying to or from the United States, including one requiring a pilot 
to land immediately when so directed. 
</P>
<P>
We do have a war on drugs and it must be won. We do not have a state of war 
that sacrifices our civil air commerce. The Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean is 
not the Persian Gulf, where many lives have been lost because of 
misidentification. Do we, as a nation, wish to create that aura in our skies? 
Who would be responsible if an airplane shot down by a DEA agent crashed into a 
house or a hotel? If McConnell's amendment is enacted, such a disaster is 
likely to happen sooner or later. More than 137,000 general-aviation business 
or pleasure flights were made into the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
I have fought in three wars for our nation and know full well how honest 
mistakes can be made in the air, even by those trained to fly in a combat 
environment. We have the best aviation system in the world. Let us not permit a 
few zealots to destroy the majority's right to free passage in the air. Let us 
find a way to arrest those who defy the law, not hazard all who fly.

2 ARRESTED DURING PROTEST AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were arrested Tuesday at a UC San Diego protest by animal rights 
activists outraged about the use of dogs for a campus laboratory class on 
emergency medical procedures, according to UC San Diego police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of those arrested was not released, but one man was arrested on 
suspicion of trespassing and another on suspicion of giving false information 
to a police officer, said Sgt. Stephen Branen. 
</P>
<P>
A banner with the words "Stop Dog Lab" was displayed over the Basic Science 
building where the lab class is scheduled to take place, said Sally Meckler, 
director of San Diego Animal Advocates, one of three organizations sponsoring 
the protest. About 100 protesters were at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Physicians will basically be cutting dogs up to learn trauma techniques," 
Meckler said. "They are already licensed doctors. They could learn much better 
by working on an anatomically correct model." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach university administration officials were unsuccessful.

CAT REFUSES TO APPEAR AT SENATE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cats are famous for refusing to come when called. State Sen. Alan Robbins 
learned Tuesday that that includes when they are called before a committee of 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins (D-Tarzana) had his cat, Daisy, summoned as a witness before the state 
Senate Judiciary Committee, which was considering a bill to require 
manufacturers of cosmetic and household products to carry label notices if they 
were tested on live animals. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is aimed at discouraging such tests, which animal welfare advocates 
say blind, scald and kill animals to determine whether chemicals endanger 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins wrote the bill and presumably was confident that his cat's appearance 
would help it. 
</P>
<P>
But when an aide went to Robbins' apartment to fetch Daisy, she dashed up the 
fireplace chimney and refused to budge. "The cat was having none of it," the 
aide explained. "That's how cats are." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Daisy's help, the bill was sent to the full Senate by a 7-1 vote.

INNOVATIVE FACILITY; 
</P>
<P>
OPERATOR FOR OCEANSIDE HOMELESS CENTER SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Women's Resource Center of Oceanside was selected Tuesday to manage the 
city's innovative trailer park for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside City Council members, sitting as the Community Development 
Commission, voted unanimously and without discussion to award the contract to 
the women's center. City Housing Committee members Councilwomen Lucy Chavez and 
Melba Bishop, had previously recommended that the center be given the contract 
based on its successful nine-year track record as manager of the Oceanside 
Battered Women's Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido-based North County Interfaith Council had also submitted a 
proposal to run the homeless shelter, which will consist of 15 trailers 
situated on a 22-acre site on the grounds of the San Luis Rey Mission. Families 
whose members have been screened for substance abuse, criminal records and 
psychiatric problems will be eligible to stay in the shelter for up to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More in Tune' 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Chavez said that she and Bishop had chosen the Women's 
Resource Center because "they seem to be more in tune with the type of shelter 
and the type of occupants we intended." Chavez said they felt the center's 
staff had gained experience, through working with battered women and children, 
with many of the similar problems that might arise with homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to make this work and to make it as non-offensive as possible 
to the surrounding neighborhood," Bishop said. "It's a prototype for all 
others. . . . If this doesn't work, there won't be another." 
</P>
<P>
The experimental program is limited to three years, which is the duration of 
the lease on the mission site, which will open this fall. But members of 
Oceanside's Task Force for the Homeless, which conceived the plan, hope that, 
if all goes well, the community will recognize the need to contribute land and 
money for a permanent facility. 
</P>
<P>
The city has allocated $300,000 for the shelter's operation, but City Housing 
Director Richard Goodman estimated that it will cost up to $450,000 to 
effectively run the program for three years. Women's Resource Center 
spokeswoman Sharon Newcomb said Tuesday that the agency is prepared to raise 
the rest of the money needed through government grants and community donations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruitment of Staff 
</P>
<P>
One of the agency's first tasks will be to recruit personnel to staff the 
homeless shelter, Newcomb said. The center will seek a full-time shelter 
administrator who will have overall responsibility for the project, a project 
supervisor to handle day-to-day operations, and five caseworkers with 
experience in providing counseling, support and dealing with domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomb said the focus of the program will be to teach homeless families how to 
function in the world around them and to make use of available services. "Our 
goal is not to make an insulated community out of this but help them 
reintegrate into the community," she said. "We feel it's real important the 
clients make their own decisions and take action for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of the program is a class in "survival skills" that will 
be offered free by MiraCosta College. The daily class will include instruction 
on nutrition, budget and home management, balancing checking accounts and 
utilizing community resources. 
</P>
<P>
Case workers will review each family's situation with them, and try to pinpoint 
the factors that contributed to their homelessness and recommend courses of 
action to avoid those problems, according to the proposal. Weekly classes on 
landlord-tenant rights and responsibilities, including instruction on "tenant 
etiquette" will be offered at the center, as well as job evaluations and 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
A child-care system will be set up among the residents, and school-age children 
will attend classes in the Oceanside Unified School District. Under the 
proposal, the staff of the Women's Resource Center also will provide training 
to teachers to heighten their sensitivity to the traumas and insecurities that 
homeless children experience.

SEWAGE PANEL CONSIDERS SEEKING EXEMPTION ON UPGRADING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, a San Diego task force Tuesday considered a proposal that 
the city defy federal law by refusing to upgrade its sewage-treatment system to 
so-called "secondary" standards. 
</P>
<P>
But the Metropolitan Sewage Task Force delayed a vote on that recommendation 
until Sept. 12, despite the apparent sentiment among a majority of its members 
that the costly treatment upgrade required by the law is unnecessary to protect 
the ocean off the city's coast. 
</P>
<P>
Any recommendation from the task force would merely be an advisory one because 
only the council can adopt a plan for improving the city's sewage-treatment 
system. City planners have proposed a project estimated to cost $2.6 billion to 
$2.86 billion if the city adheres to the dictates of the U.S. Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the task force's discussion is significant because it represents 
the first formal recognition of claims by Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
scientists that a full treatment upgrading is unnecessary and would cost the 
city $700 million to $1 billion more than it truly needs to spend. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that advice, City Council members Bruce Henderson and Bob Filner have 
been pressing for an alternative to the secondary-sewage upgrading that might 
include lobbying Congress for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has sued the city to force it to comply 
with the "secondary" standard, under which 85% to 90% of solids are removed 
from effluent. The city's current "advanced primary" system removes about 75% 
of solids. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement negotiations are continuing, but the city and the federal government 
are scheduled to square off in court Dec. 5. A major issue is how quickly the 
city would be required to upgrade the treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
EPA administrators and scientists last week told the task force that the 190 
million gallons of sewage discharged into the sea daily from the city's Point 
Loma treatment plant cause changes in the environment there and that the city 
has no choice but to upgrade its treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
Task force Vice Chairman John Leach proposed keeping the plant at advanced 
primary standards until at least 2010. After that, the city would reconsider 
upgrading the plant to secondary standards. Under Leach's plan, another 120 
million gallons a day of sewage would be cleansed for reuse in irrigation.

DEFENDANT DENIES FATAL STABBING IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mexican citizen pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges related to the stabbing 
death of a man in Balboa Park this month. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Garcia Gutierrez, 19, is scheduled to go to trial Oct. 6 in the July 5 
slaying and armed robbery of Franklin James Black, 33. 
</P>

PICUS JOINS GROUPS SEEKING TO RESTRICT TERMS IN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joy Picus joined representatives of San Fernando Valley 
community groups Tuesday in urging a commission on ethics in city government to 
limit the number of terms elected officials can serve. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, who has been on the council for 12 years, told Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley's ethics commission that a limit on terms in office would "function as 
a deterrent to lapses that result from complacency" in ethical matters by 
entrenched politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Limits would also provide "constant opportunities for upward mobility" for 
politicians eager to move to higher office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she favors limiting terms of all local and state officeholders. 
Presently, there are no limitations on how many terms that state legislators 
and elected Los Angeles officials can serve. 
</P>
<P>
Picus appeared at a public hearing in Studio City held by the ethics commission 
-- formally named the Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for Los Angeles City 
Government. It was the seventh meeting -- and the first at which community 
comment was sought -- since the commission was set up in April amid controversy 
over Bradley's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
City, state and federal agencies are looking into the mayor's stock 
transactions and whether his influence resulted in the deposit of city funds 
into Far East National Bank, for which he was a paid adviser. Bradley has 
returned the fees and denied using his official position to benefit himself or 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Standards 
</P>
<P>
The commission's novel charter is to redefine proper conduct by city officials. 
It already has recommended tough new standards for officials to disclose 
investments, real estate holdings and other financial interests, saying 
existing disclosure laws were weak and poorly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Hunter of the North Hollywood Residents Assn. said local officeholders 
should be held to two four-year terms. He proposed that those who can win a 60% 
majority in a subsequent election be allowed another two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's doing a great job . . . and his constituents like him, he'll get 60%. 
And if not, then he's out of luck," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Harrar, assistant director of California Common Cause, said a two-term 
limit would be "a bit too restrictive." He said too strict a limit would drive 
good politicians out of office just as they acquire expertise in government. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and Harrar did not say what limit they favor. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrar said Common Cause supports limits on terms only if they are 
accompanied by new limits on campaign contributions and spending, calling the 
ability of incumbents to build up large campaign treasuries their most 
important advantage over challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Harrar said a study done by his group showed that Los Angeles City Council 
members have served an average of 12 years and that four members have served 25 
years or more. The study also found that between 1982 and 1988, only seven 
newcomers were elected to the state Legislature, while 340 incumbents were 
reelected. 
</P>
<P>
It has gotten to the point where would-be challengers have "to wait for scandal 
or for somebody to die in office" before they can enter the race, he said. 
"Incumbents stay in office longer and longer due to the inability of 
challengers to match their financing." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics commission is expected to hold four more hearings before presenting 
its final report. Among other topics, the hearings will examine if city 
elections should be publicly financed.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L. A. BACKS EXTENSION OF HILLSIDE HOUSE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsed a proposal by Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky on Tuesday to extend existing limits on house sizes into more 
hillside areas of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed the city Planning Department to draft an ordinance calling 
for a yearlong ban on houses that cover more than half of their lots or exceed 
30 feet in height. During that ban, the Planning Department would study the 
problem of large houses and propose a permanent solution. 
</P>
<P>
Once drafted, the ordinance must be approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said his action was prompted by the parking and traffic problems 
that occur when houses fill their lots on narrow hillside streets. He and 
community activists have also expressed concerns about a developer's plans to 
build up to 20 houses along Hopevale Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In his motion, Yaroslavsky said he wanted to "avoid the irreparable damage that 
may occur in this area without some restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for developer CTC Management said the firm has not finished its 
plans for the land but does not intend to build houses that are 
disproportionate with lot sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is to include properties bordered by Mulholland Drive, the San 
Diego Freeway, Valley Vista Boulevard and Dixie Canyon Avenue. The council had 
approved the same limits in May for a strip of land in the middle of that area.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FBI STARTS INQUIRY INTO SIMI RACIAL VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI has opened an investigation into a vandalism attack that left the home 
of a black Simi Valley family in shambles and defaced by racial epithets, Gary 
Auer, supervisor of the agency's Ventura County office, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Auer said the FBI is required to investigate racially motivated crimes under 
the 1968 Civil Rights Act. He declined to discuss details of the case, but said 
his office would be working with the Simi Valley Police Department in its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Detective Anthony Anzilotti said the federal agency's 
involvement "could be beneficial." No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The word skinheads was among the graffiti spray-painted inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
The damage was discovered Aug. 14 when Louis Boss, his wife and four children 
returned to their home on Niles Street from an out-of-town trip. Boss, 36, is 
an English and reading teacher at Northridge Junior High School.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. CLOSES LOOPHOLE IN SUN VALLEY DENSITY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to close a potential loophole in a 
policy passed in February to lower the density of development in Sun Valley 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
The action, which becomes part of the Sun Valley Community Plan, limits the 
development and grading of land that has a slope of at least 15%. The area of 
Sun Valley affected by Tuesday's vote is in rural La Tuna Canyon south of La 
Tuna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The policy approved Tuesday calculates the slope of the entire parcel of land 
that is being developed. The earlier council policy would have allowed the 
slope to be calculated for portions of a parcel, which the planning staff 
feared could allow for denser development than intended. 
</P>
<P>
Arline DeSanctis, chief deputy of Councilman Joel Wachs, said that the council 
was confused by the February motion and that the discrepancy was not discovered 
until later. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions apply to lots zoned for one house per 40,000 square feet, 
for one house per two acres and for one house per five acres. Lots that fit 
those zoning categories cannot be given exemptions from the limits if they have 
a slope of at least 15%. In addition, no grading of principal ridgelines is 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure restricting hillside development in a larger area of the 
northeast San Fernando Valley -- including Lake View Terrace, Sunland-Tujunga 
and Shadow Hills -- is to be considered by the city Planning Commission later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the foothill communities have turned out in large numbers at 
meetings to discuss the proposal.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POSSIBLE ARSON FIRE DESTROYS 3 HOUSES IN LANCASTER 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost one week to the minute after a possible arson fire destroyed 20 houses 
under construction in Palmdale, a blaze of suspicious origin raced through a 
construction project near neighboring Lancaster on Tuesday, destroying three 
partially completed houses and damaging two others, the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, near 52nd Street West and Avenue L-8, west of Quartz Hill, caused 
about $230,000 in damage, said Chris Button, a Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was reported at 6:01 p.m., only three minutes after the time that 
last week's fire started 12 miles away, Button said. 
</P>
<P>
Both fires started about three hours after the last workers left for the day, 
he said. "I think it's suspicious because of the length of time between the 
time construction stopped and the time the fire started," Button said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the wind-driven fire last week, which caused about $1.5 million in 
damage at the California Dawn development, the winds in Tuesday's fire pushed 
flames away from other houses under construction, thus limiting damage, Button 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The houses were in the early stages of construction, he said. They were among 
about 100 three-, four- and five-bedroom single-family houses for sale at the 
Crystal Meadows development by P&amp;V Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 firefighters contained Tuesday's fire in about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into last week's blaze has not turned up physical evidence of 
arson, he said. But fire investigators said the blaze began in the rafters of 
one of the buildings, which they called an unlikely ignition point for an 
accidental fire. 
</P>
<P>
The point of origin of the latest fire had not been determined Tuesday evening, 
Button said. A formal probe of that blaze was to be launched today.

RED-HOT ROYALS DROP ANGELS TWO GAMES BACK, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain, rather than Angels, fell at Royals Stadium Tuesday night, but not heavily 
enough to suit the Angels' purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a rain delay of 1 hour 25 minutes, the game went on. 
</P>
<P>
Darn the Angels' luck. 
</P>
<P>
For the seventh time in as many tries, the Angels lost to the Royals in Kansas 
City, this time by a 4-2 score. And, for the second time in as many nights, the 
Angels lost ground to Oakland in the American League West standings, now 
trailing the front-running Athletics by two games. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Angels are nearly as close to third place as they are first 
place. With the victory, Kansas City's eighth in a row, the Royals moved to 
within 2 1/2 games of the Angels with two games remaining in this series and 
Tom Gordon (15-4) scheduled to pitch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Just two days ago, the Angels were the team on a roll, taking a five-game 
winning streak and a power-hitting offense into Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they've spent two games here and lost one starting pitcher (Chuck Finley), 
two 4-2 decisions and any momentum they might have built after pounding 
Minnesota and Cleveland last week in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very streaky," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Everybody knows that. And 
right now, we are catching a club that is very hot. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we are not swinging the bats well enough to win. We need to 
regroup and play better baseball the rest of the series." 
</P>
<P>
Angel catcher Lance Parrish seconded that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope everybody shows up tomorrow ready to go," Parrish said. "We can't 
afford to let too many more slip away from us . . . Now is the time." 
</P>
<P>
For Kansas City, it is, anyway. With the Angels and the A's in town for seven 
games this week, the Royals entered this series talking about playoff 
atmosphere and intensity and the need to capitalize on this chance to jump back 
into the AL West race. 
</P>
<P>
In Parrish's view, the Angels need to get that same feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a tendency to get into little lulls, where we want to let 
things happen instead of making them happen," he said. "That seems to be the 
story with these two games here. There seems to be no energy -- and this 
probably isn't the greatest time to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully tomorrow, we'll shake out of it." 
</P>
<P>
In their latest loss, the Angels managed but five hits against four Kansas City 
pitchers -- and this was with starter Mark Gubicza lasting two innings. Gubicza 
was a victim of the rain delay, pulled by Manager John Wathan after six outs 
for future considerations -- i.e., this weekend's encounter with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
By replacing Gubicza with reliever Terry Leach in the third inning, Wathan is 
hoping to bring Gubicza back with two days' rest for Friday's series opener 
with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Wathan has won half his gamble. Leach picked up after the 85-minute 
delay and pitched five innings of two-hit ball, yielding only an unearned run. 
Then, Wathan turned it over to relievers Rick Luecken and Jeff Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, a mid-season acquisition from the New York Mets, is 5-3, having won 
three times during the Royals' current streak. A fourth-inning double to Chili 
Davis and a sixth-inning single to Devon White were the only hits he allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"Same old Leach," Rader said. "He's a guy who gives us trouble. In particular, 
he gives our left-handed hitters problems." 
</P>
<P>
That's due in part to Leach's pitching motion, the type of delivery that hasn't 
been seen in these parts since Dan Quisenberry's era. 
</P>
<P>
Leach inherited a 1-0 lead, courtesy of Mike Witt's latest two-out lapse, 
coming in the bottom of the first inning. Witt (8-11) retired the first two 
batters he faced -- and then allowed hits to the next three. 
</P>
<P>
After striking out leadoff hitter Kevin Seitzer and getting Willie Wilson to 
ground to second base, Witt surrendered a single to George Brett. 
</P>
<P>
And another to Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
And another to Jim Eisenreich, this a bouncer up the middle that scored Brett 
from second base. He escaped further damage when Jackson overran third base 
after White's throw eluded third baseman Jack Howell. Witt backing up, fired to 
Howell and Jackson was nailed trying to get back to third. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City took that lead into the rain delay. Witt returned after sitting for 
nearly 90 minutes. Rader was asked if he considered changing pitchers for the 
resumption of the game, as Wathan did. 
</P>
<P>
"No, because he didn't throw enough to begin the game to get stiff," Rader 
said. "So, it wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley figures to miss at least one start as a result of the foot injury 
that knocked him out of Monday night's game after 17 pitches. Today, Finley 
will undergo a bone scan to determine whether or not he has a stress fracture 
in his left foot, but either way, Finley isn't expected to pitch again before 
next week. If a stress fracture is ruled out, Finley will receive a cortisone 
injection in the foot, which should sideline him through Saturday, his next 
scheduled start. "The doctor wanted to shoot it with cortisone today, but he 
thought the cortisone might hide the effects of the bone scan," Finley said. 
"So we'll do the scan first and if no hot spots (fractures) are there, he'll 
shoot it up then." 
</P>
<P>
Finley hurt the foot by rolling over on it while warming up in the bullpen. "It 
felt like a burn," he said. "At first, I thought it was just a different 
twisting of the foot. It was a little sore, but I thought it'd go away after a 
couple pitches. Instead, it got worse and worse, and then, I had trouble 
walking. I knew I wouldn't be out there much longer." Finley said he felt no 
improvement in the foot Tuesday, but was talking hopefully in preparation of 
today's bone scan. "I'm not expecting it to be any big deal," he said. "I think 
it's more like a bruise. They're just taking (the scan) to make sure there's 
not a crack. If I can get the soreness out of it, I should be ready to go in a 
couple days. If it's one start, I'm sure the team can pick me up. I think 
that's the worst that can happen -- that I miss one start." Finley grinned. 
"This is September, or getting close to it," he noted. "It's got to be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have Bert Blyleven, the Royals have Bret Saberhagen. And when 
Tuesday's game was delayed nearly 90 minutes because of rain, Saberhagen donned 
a ski mask and one of Bo Jackson's jerseys -- which he overstuffed with padding 
-- and launched into a home run trot on the slick tarpaulin. That soon evolved 
into headfirst slides and belly-flops into the largest puddles on the tarp.

MORNING BRIEFING: EX-49ER COACH WALSH THROWS MEDIA FOR LOSS IN NBC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a seminar called by NBC to introduce its new announcers for the pro football 
season, the introduction of Bill Walsh was saved for last. 
</P>
<P>
According to Glenn Sheeley of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Walsh 
calmly walked up to address the group. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, Walsh said, "G-g-g-good m-m-m-morning, it's g-g-good to s-s-see 
y-y-you." 
</P>
<P>
Sheeley: "When NBC-TV executive producer Terry O'Neil's heart started again, he 
couldn't stop laughing." 
</P>
<P>
The holdup: Mike Schad, the big tackle from Canada who was a bust with the Rams 
after they made him their No. 1 pick in 1986, is a potential starter this 
season with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Schad was endorsed by former lineman Doug Bartlett. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett: "There's nothing wrong with his toughness. The only thing wrong that 
I can see is that he doesn't know how to hold yet." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who is the only player to win stolen base titles in both the 
American League and National League? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Chasing the Horse: Cal Ripken's move into third place last week in consecutive 
games played has, naturally, raised the question of his possibly catching Lou 
Gehrig, whose record of 2,130 straight games has long been looked upon as 
unassailable. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows, of course, whether the Baltimore Oriole shortstop can catch the 
Iron Horse, but if he does, he will be younger than Gehrig was when Gehrig's 
remarkable streak ended. Gehrig was 35 when he stepped out of the Yankee 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken will turn 29 Thursday and, if he keeps his streak alive, will be 34, 
about two months shy of 35, when he matches Gehrig's record in the 70th game of 
the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
Help Wanted: Mike Tyson not only is running out of opponents, he is running low 
on sparring partners. He went through 10 before the Carl (The Truth) Williams 
fight. Either they were getting busted up or were sent home because they did 
little else but run in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Page, one of the few who lasted, told the Philadelphia Inquirer: "You 
should have seen Melvin Epps. Carl Lewis has nothing on him." 
</P>
<P>
Page, a former champion, said: "Most people are afraid of Mike Tyson. I think 
I'm just crazy enough to have no fear of him. The only person I fear is God . . 
. and my wife." 
</P>
<P>
Cerebral Cowboy: Dallas Cowboy Owner Jerry Jones, who played football with 
Jimmy Johnson at Arkansas, told the Houston Chronicle: "Jimmy is not head coach 
of the Cowboys because he is my friend. Our friendship merely made me aware of 
his tremendous intellect and coaching skill. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy was one of those students who could look at a book for 20 minutes and go 
to class and take a test, while everybody else had to work hours and days and 
days to get ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
53 years ago today: On Aug. 23, 1936, 17-year-old Bob Feller, in his first 
major league start, recorded 15 strikeouts as the Cleveland Indians beat the 
St. Louis Browns, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ron LeFlore. He stole 68 bases for Detroit in 1978 and 97 bases 
for Montreal in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Former catcher Bob Uecker, on how he knew his career with the 
Atlanta Braves was over: "When the manager, Luman Harris, told me no visitors 
were allowed in the clubhouse."

Hardly any sports enthusiast suffers more than a Chicago Cub fan. For nearly 
half a century Cub fans have known frustration much more than success. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the years when the Cubs have had good teams, they have let the fans 
down. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Cubs have been a delightful surprise. They have been leading the 
National League East much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Is it just another case of false optimism? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps so. 
</P>
<P>
A defensive and pitching collapse has put the Cubs in their worst slump of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
An error by third baseman Vance Law spoiled the major league debut of Joe 
Kraemer Tuesday at Chicago and helped the Cincinnati Reds romp to a 7-2 
victory. It was the Cubs' fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scoreless game with the Reds batting in the second. There were two 
outs and the bases loaded. Pitcher Tom Browning hit a routine grounder and Law 
booted it to allow the first run to score. Seldom used Dave Collins followed 
with a two-run single and Kraemer never recovered. Neither did the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
With Browning, one of the hottest pitchers in the league, looking strong, 
Cincinnati controlled the game. Browning (13-10), who gave up nine hits, won 
his sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was pounding a million miles a second while I was warming up," 
Kraemer said. "I guess I'm going to have to work on bearing down to get that 
third out next time I pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Another error finished Kraemer with two out in the fourth. He gave up seven 
hits and six runs in his 3 2/3 innings, but only two runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who had three hits, drove in three runs and scored a run, was playing 
because acting manager Tommy Helms played a hunch. Reds' Manager Pete Rose was 
absent because his wife gave birth to their second child. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave is a better right-handed hitter and we're so banged up we had to get a 
body out there," Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
In the close Eastern division race, three teams are within three games of the 
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, New York 0 -- Kevin Mitchell became the first Giant in 20 
years to hit 40 home runs, but that wasn't the big story at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper, released last month by Houston and signed by the Giants out of 
desperation because of a injury-riddled pitching staff, threw a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Knepper (6-11) pitched his first complete game this season. It was his 30th 
shutout and sixth against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had only a 1-0 lead against luckless Frank Viola (1-3) when Robby 
Thompson and Will Clark beat out bunts in the sixth inning Mitchell hit a drive 
deep into the left-field bleachers. He became only the fourth National Leaguer 
to hit 40 home runs in the 80s. Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson also 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 Willie McCovey hit 45 for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 10, Atlanta 5 -- Tommy Gregg hit a pinch-hit home run with one out in 
the eighth inning at Atlanta to spoil Ted Power's bid for a no-hitter at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
After an error prolonged the inning, Dale Murphy hit a three-run home run and 
Power was gone. But, the right-hander who started in the Dodger organization, 
had a 10-0 cushion going into the eighth, so he improved to 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh consecutive solid effort for Power, 34, who gave up seven 
runs to San Francisco in 1 1/3 innings in his first start July 17. In his last 
seven starts he is 4-1. He has pitched 49 2/3 innings, giving up only nine 
earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, with Tony Pena getting three hits and driving in five runs, 
moved to within three games of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Assenmacher tied a major league record by striking out four Cardinals in 
the fifth inning. The reliever is the 20th to achieve that feat. After two 
strikeouts, Assenmacher also struck out Pena, but the third strike was a wild 
pitch, a run scoring and Pena reaching first. He then struck out Power. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Houston 1 -- John Smiley is about the only thing the Pirates have 
to smile about these days. Smiley (10-7) pitched a six-hitter at Pittsburgh and 
dropped the Astros 2 1/2 games behind the Giants in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla went three for four, including a two-run home run, as the Pirates 
ended the Astros' four-game winning streak and beat them for only the third 
time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Davis hit his 31st homer in the ninth to spoil Smiley's shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, San Diego 2 -- Ken Howell gave up only one hit in seven innings 
at Philadelphia and Dickie Thon's run-scoring single sparked a three-run 
seventh to give him his 10th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst injured a groin and left after three innings. DAN

GLENDALE LOOKS TO FILL SOME WHITE SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corey White, who averaged 5.5 yards a carry and scored four touchdowns as a 
junior at Glendale High last season, was expected to be one of the best running 
backs in the Pacific League. In fact, as recently as last week, a local 
publication ranked White among the top backs in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There's one problem: White no longer lives in the area. He moved to San Diego 
this summer because of an illness in his family. He plans to play at Lincoln, 
the school he attended as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
White approached Glendale Coach Don Shoemaker a day before spring practice and 
tearfully told him of the situation. Although disappointed by the loss, 
Shoemaker understood. "It was a family-type thing and you've got to respect 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters have plenty of players hoping to fill White's cleats, including 
Arsenio Guvarra, Hoover transfer Waki Jones, Min Cho and Hector Maya. White, 
6-feet, 180 pounds, rushed for 558 yards in nine games last year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, White's transfer smarts. "He had an opportunity to really capture some 
headlines," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, he still can. 
</P>
<P>
Boomerang Brown: Leonice Brown ended speculation about where he would attend 
school when he showed up at Crespi for the football team's first practice 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who gained 122 yards in 25 carries as a reserve tailback last season, 
was declared ineligible to return to Crespi after failing a spring class but 
cleared his record by attending summer school at Montclair Prep. Earlier in the 
summer, he participated in one practice at San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi Coach Tim Lins said that no changes in the offense are planned as a 
result of Brown's return. Senior Lucas Freeman, who had seven carries for 42 
yards last season, is also vying for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to work (Brown) into our offense," said Lins, who clocked 
him at 4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash. "If he becomes a player, then maybe 
we'll change." 
</P>
<P>
To play or not to play: Montclair Prep, which donned pads Thursday for the 
start of a promising season, will be without the services of Keyaan Cook who 
apparently has elected not to play football as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who passed for 638 yards as quarterback for the Mounties last season, was 
not in attendance for the official start of practice for Southern Section 
teams. Apparently, Cook has taken the advice of his brother Toi and will 
concentrate on baseball. Keyaan was the shortstop on the Mounties' Alpha League 
champion team last season. Toi, a defensive back for the New Orleans Saints, 
played football and baseball at Montclair Prep and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The news comes as a blow to Coach George Giannini who had planned to use Cook 
at outside linebacker this season. Giannini knew of Cook's dilemma and asked 
for his services this fall through a personal letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," Giannini said. "I was surprised. I'd have bet my money 
that he was going to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Giannini will now pencil in Chris Portugal, a 6-1, 185-pound sophomore, at 
outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to look in the past," Giannini said. "We've got our program 
rolling along at Montclair and we're excited." 
</P>
<P>
Changing of the guard: Tim Beidle is the new man on the job at Canyon, 
succeeding Rod Baltau as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. The senior played 
last season behind Baltau, who passed for 2,099 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been groomed for the position," Coach Harry Welch said of Beidle. 
</P>
<P>
Beidle (5-10, 155) played in six games last season and completed seven of 12 
passes for 94 yards and one touchdown. He threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Weighty issue: Senior tailback Chris Peery weighed in at 216 pounds this 
summer, 20 pounds lighter than he was at the start of last season. Peery's 
weight reduction, however, was not the result of a crash diet or fasting 
frenzy, according to Welch. Peery simply reported to practice in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"He just happens to be a big kid," Welch said of Peery, who stands 6 feet, 1 
inch. "He's always had good moves, but now they seem to flow. We threw to him a 
little bit more in the summer time. Certainly, Chris Peery is going to get the 
call most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Add weight: Anthony Hess, a senior offensive tackle at Quartz Hill, is 
6-foot-7, 285 pounds. That's right, 6-7, 285. 
</P>
<P>
Hess, who transferred last year from North Dakota, started at tackle on offense 
and defense last season. This season, Coach John Albee said that Hess likely 
will play exclusively on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a so-so year as a junior," Albee said. "But he's got all the potential 
in the world."

CUCCIA NEEDS SCHOOL DISTRICT'S OK TO SECURE JOB AS POLY FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poly High Principal Virginia Holt will hire Fred Cuccia as the school's 
football coach if he gains Los Angeles Unified School District approval as a 
teacher. Cuccia is a physical education and English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Holt met Tuesday with Cuccia, who was recommended for the job by George 
Tideback, the school's athletic director. Tideback said that district approval 
in this case was merely a formality. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia, 44, formerly coached at La Puente, Hoover and South Pasadena highs 
before moving north last year to coach California High in Sam Ramon for one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kennedy, Poly's coach for three years, resigned last week to become an 
assistant coach at L. A. Southwest College.

DIGEST: DELAITTRE TRANSFERS TO VALLEY AFTER REDSHIRTING 1ST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn DeLaittre, who helped lead Simi Valley High to the Southern Section 4-A 
Division basketball title in 1988, has transferred from Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo to Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre, a forward who averaged 21.6 points and 8.8 rebounds a game during 
his senior season at Simi Valley, transferred to Valley after redshirting his 
freshman season at San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Block, 25, has been hired as defensive line and film coach for the Cal 
State Northridge grid team. 
</P>
<P>
Block worked with the defensive line at Southeast Missouri State last season. 
He previously had been a graduate assistant at Arkansas State, where he 
attended school and played football. 
</P>
<P>
Block replaces Jerry Campbell, the new football coach at St. Bernard High in 
Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Albert Fann, linebacker Preston Hayslette, quarterback Sherdrick 
Bonner and tight end Richard Ane have been selected captains of the Cal State 
Northridge grid team by the players. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers have signed former Cleveland High player Kevin Holmes to 
a one-year contract to play backup to forward Charles Barkley. Terms of the 
contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, 24, was the 76ers' fifth-round draft pick in the 1986 NBA draft. For 
the past three years, he has played overseas for Pully, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the 6-foot-8 Holmes averaged 25 points and 10 rebounds. His team 
won the Swiss league, playoffs and Swiss Cup. 
</P>

ENCINO SHUT DOWN IN THIRD ROUND OF PONY WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encino stranded eight baserunners, including three in the sixth inning, and was 
defeated by Seoul, South Korea, 4-0, Tuesday in a third-round game of the Pony 
League World Series in Washington, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Encino (16-3) managed only four singles against Hyuk Kang and Hyun Hwang Jae, 
who combined to lead the defending champions into the final round. Encino 
loaded the bases with two out in the sixth, but Hyun relieved Hyuk and struck 
out Chris Garza on a 2-2 curve to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul (13-0) scored the only run it would need when Han Sohn Suk hit a solo 
home run off Garza (7-1) in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
For Encino, Cesar Martinez had two hits and Glen Carson and Garza each singled. 
</P>
<P>
Encino will play Orland Park, Ill., today at 4:30 p.m. The winner will face 
Seoul at 4:30 p.m. Thursday and must defeat Seoul twice to win the title.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD;

MTV'S UNNATURAL MUSEUM MAY GET POTATOES OFF COUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faithful viewers of MTV, it's time once again to temporarily cease and desist 
from being a lethargic couch potato and get in on some of the on-screen action 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the North County Fair shopping center in 
Escondido will this week host MTV's Museum of UnNatural History, a traveling 
road show of pop music, culture, fashion and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Step inside the 3,000-square-foot museum, set up Thursday through Sunday in the 
mall's central walkway, and you'll get a firsthand look at the MTV life style 
through more than 20 displays, grouped in four areas: 
</P>
<P>
* In the "New Music" section, a wall of 16 television monitors, stacked into a 
square, will broadcast the latest music videos from established artists as well 
as promising upstarts. Visitors will also get the chance to make their own 
videos, using MTV cameras, stages and props. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Long Live Rock" exhibit will display rock 'n' roll memorabilia on loan 
from the Hard Rock Cafe collection. There will be gold records, rare 
photographs, autographs, clothes and guitars from such pop heroes as Keith 
Richards, Bon Jovi, George Michael, Joan Jett, the Fat Boys and the Traveling 
Wilburys (Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison). 
</P>
<P>
New this year is a painting of what, from up close, looks like an aquarium full 
of fish. But stand back and what suddenly emerges is the face of the late Jim 
Morrison. MTV commissioned artist Doug Auld to paint the portrait. Auld will be 
on hand to sign autographs all four days the museum is in town. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Addicted to Style" section celebrates the latest pop fashion and beauty 
trends. The highlight promises to be the campy 3-D "Gone Fishing" display, a 
series of moving scenes that will show you the right look for leisure-time 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Products for Better Living" area will showcase the latest in pop 
technology through a variety of commercially sponsored displays. Among them are 
Sunkist Soft Drinks' "Make Your Own Surf Video" booth, which will give museum 
visitors the chance to be videotaped aboard a simulated surfboard; a 
nickelodeon with continuous showings of Hershey's animated Twizzlers licorice 
promotional clip; and Designamics' exhibit of innovative inventions that have 
yet to catch on, like the amphibious car. 
</P>
<P>
The star attraction: "Robo Doc's Body Shop," will take a futuristic look at 
automobile-repair garages, complete with a greasy-fingered robot mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
On last year's inaugural tour of shopping centers throughout the country, MTV's 
Museum of UnNatural History was visited by more than 5 million people, and host 
malls reported traffic increases of 5% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
This year's 28-week, 24-city cross-country swing began in March in Durham, 
N.C., and concludes next month in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, almost to the day, Blue Oyster Cult headlined a sold-out show at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium attended by more than 50,000 screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently most of those screams have long since been silenced. When the 
pioneering New York heavy metal band returns to San Diego this week, it will be 
for a two-night stand, Thursday and Friday, at the 500-seat Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of Blue Oyster Cult, described by the Rolling Stone 
Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll as "semi-satiric exponents of the high-decibel 
apocalypse," is a testament to the inherent fickleness of pop-music audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Blue Oyster Cult helped usher in the first wave of heavy 
metal with such savage head-banging anthems as "Tyranny and Mutation," "Cities 
on Flame" and "Hot Rails to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the live "On Your Feet or On Your Knees" LP became the group's first 
gold album, and a year later, after adopting a less explosive, more mainstream 
pop sound, they scored their first Top 40 single with "(Don't Fear) The 
Reaper." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, Blue Oyster Cult continued to do quite 
well, both on the charts and on the concert trail. 
</P>
<P>
But, in recent years, the group's place in the hearts of heavy metal fans has 
been taken over by newer, younger bands like Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses and Great 
White. Blue Oyster Cult's last hit album was 1982's "Extraterrestrial Live," 
and their last Top 40 single was 1981's "Burnin' For You." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other first-generation heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin and Grand 
Funk Railroad, however, Blue Oyster Cult has steadfastly refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
And, from the sounds of their last couple of albums, they're still able to 
raise as much commotion as their younger, more commercially successful 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego techno-pop duo Red Flag, whose debut album, "Naive Art," 
has just been released on the Enigma Records label, will co-headline the 
upcoming Ocean Aid concert with veteran new wave zanies Devo. The two-day

the Ocean Aid Foundation, a nonprofit trust that distributes funds to 
environmental groups concerned with protecting the ocean. . . . Tickets go on 
sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for the Doobie Brothers' Oct. 1 concert at the 
Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park, and for The Cure's Sept. 12 show at the Sports 
Arena. Tickets go on sale Saturday at noon for The Judds' Oct. 1 show at San 
Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and Monday at 10 a.m. for Michael W. 
Smith's Nov. 5 show at the Starlight Bowl.. . . Foghat will appear at the 
Bacchanal Sept. 8, and not at Diego's El Cajon two days later, as reported last 
week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Bullet Boys, Spider Blue and Bang 
Tango, Thursday at Iguana's in Tijuana; Jimmy Cliff, also Thursday, at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Joe Jackson, Saturday at the Open Air Theater; 
Jackson Browne, Sunday at the Open Air Theater; Al Green, also Sunday, at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island, and the U.K. Subs, Aug. 28 at the Spirit in Bay

"It's an odd idea for someone like me, to keep a diary; not only because I have 
never done so before, but because it seems to me that neither I -- nor for that 
matter anyone else -- will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13-year-old 
schoolgirl." -- From "The Diary of Anne Frank" 
</P>
<P>
Anne Frank died in the Nazi concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen two months 
before its liberation and three months before her 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
She was just one of the 6 million Jews who died at Nazi hands during World War 
II. The simple diary she left -- bursting with girlish confessions, complaints, 
laughter, tears, dreams and longings -- gave the Holocaust a human face. 
</P>
<P>
The diary begins just before Anne went into hiding with her family and four 
other Jews in a cramped attic in the Netherlands, and ends with the family's 
discovery by the Nazis 2 1/2 years later. Anne's father, Otto, was the only 
member of the family to survive the concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the play, now at Lamb's Players Theatre through Sept. 17, reopens the 
personal pain that lies buried under the statistics. The story is all the more 
poignant because Anne is mercilessly honest in describing the eight refugees in 
the cramped attic. She records the spats about whether or not she will eat her 
vegetables, her struggle with her lessons, the jokes, the joys, the challenge 
to come up with some kind of presents for each other on birthdays -- such as 
sugar saved from Anne's porridge used to make sweets for the others -- and the 
moment when she first felt herself falling in love with Peter, the teen-age son 
of the other couple hiding with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the production could not be more apt. In a city where 
anti-Semitic actions have been rampant this year -- from the bombings of the 
San Diego Jewish Times (the most recent occurred last week) to the painting of 
swastikas on a synagogue, the House of Israel in Balboa Park and private homes 
-- one has to applaud a small Christian theater troupe such as Lamb's, which 
has dared to tackle a story that reveals the blood on the hands of those who 
sport such symbols of hate. 
</P>
<P>
The direction of Robert Smyth, artistic director of Lamb's, is exemplary. He 
never once dips into the temptation to sentimentalize or soften the portraits. 
And the actors, excellent all, reward him with fully fleshed-out performances 
that seem all the more touching for not disguising the warts. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot overpraise 16-year-old Julie Arnall in the pivotal role of Anne. 
Spirited, forceful, sweet and sour, alternately brimming with confidence and 
anxious with confusion, she is proof that the smart-talking 13-year-old is not 
a recent sociological phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Weldon is a shy, sensitive revelation as Peter, the object of her 
affections. To watch Anne coax him out of his shell suggests the gentle wonder 
of seeing a butterfly emerge from a cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
Anne's parents are played by Carmen Beaubeaux and David Cochran Heath with 
quiet dignity. The pain on Beaubeaux's face as Anne rejects her in favor of her 
father is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
Peter's parents, the Van Daans, are played by Deborah Gilmour Smyth and James 
Pascarella as a couple fractured by the tension that makes them jump at each 
other's throats. The way she clings to her fur coat, her last symbol of 
departed elegance, and he to his cigarettes, so dearly bought on the black 
market, suggests the pathos of the pressure that brings two decent, but hardly 
heroic, people to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Redo brings tight control to Mr. Dussel, the dentist whom the crowded 
family finds room for in their cramped space. Erica Kuhn lends quiet sweetness 
to Anne's older sister, Margot; though an air of more knowing would enhance the 
tiny role. Veronica Murphy Smith winningly mixes courage with modesty as Miep, 
Otto Frank's stenographer, who helped hide the troupe and nourish it, 
physically and spiritually, with food and news from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Buckley's set design, a central, crowded kitchen, bordered by beds, along 
with the theater's in-the-round space, accentuates the sense of being 
surrounded by hostile forces. Mark Coterill's classical and dignified sound 
design adds to the depth of the mood, as does the director's simple and 
effective lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The one critical absence in the production is the failure to find a way to tell 
audiences what happened to those in hiding after they were caught. The story 
may have been famous when it was published in 1952, but a new generation has 
come around since then, and the memories of even those who recall the work may 
not be as sharp as they should be. Audience members filing out on opening night 
wondered aloud about the families' fate. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem easy enough to allow each actor to give the name of his character 
and tell how and where he died, a story by itself: Mr. Van Daan, gassed Sept. 
6, 1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp; Mr. Dussel, died Dec. 20, 1944, 
Neuengamme concentration camp; Mrs. Frank, died Jan. 6, 1945, 
Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp; Anne and Margot Frank, died between 
February and March, 1945, Bergen-Belsen concentration camp; Mrs. Van Daan, died 
between April 9 and May 8, 1945, while being transferred from Germany to 
Czechoslovakia; Peter Van Daan, died May 5, 1945, in Mauthausen concentration 
camp, three days before that camp's liberation. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Frank, the only one to survive, died Aug. 19, 1980, after publishing the 
diary and commissioning the play from Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, thus 
fulfilling his dead daughter's dream of someday becoming a famous writer. How 
tragic that the price of achieving the dream was to be so great.

3 BIG FIRMS MAY AVOID ROLLBACKS; 
</P>
<P>
GILLESPIE SAYS LOWER INSURANCE RATES UNLIKELY FOR MOST DRIVERS 
</P>

<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Tuesday that three of California's 
largest auto insurers -- State Farm Mutual, the Farmers group and the 
Automobile Club of Southern California -- are among hundreds of companies that 
are likely to be exempted from all rollbacks called for under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The three big companies alone control a third of the California insurance 
market. 
</P>
<P>
It is now "a fair prediction that by and large" most Californians are "not 
going to get lower auto insurance rates" as a result of the insurance 
initiative passed last November, Gillespie said, unless the Legislature adopts 
other reforms, such as no-fault insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not categorically rule out ordering rollbacks for 219 
companies, including the three big sellers, she put them on a "slow track" 
hearing process she said could take as long as 10 years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
This represented a sharp departure from her earlier promise to make all her 
rollback decisions by Nov. 8. She explained Tuesday that there is simply too 
much to do by that time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fashioning 'Guidelines' 
</P>
<P>
She said that instead she now hopes to have fashioned "guidelines" by then that 
she hopes some companies will voluntarily follow. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also conceded Tuesday that the state's least efficient insurers are 
most likely to be given exemptions because they operate on a thinner profit 
margin, while more efficient companies showing healthier profits are most 
likely to be ordered to give the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican commissioner's statements were greeted with outrage by consumer 
leaders and Democratic politicians as the political dispute surrounding 
insurance issues intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader declared, "Gillespie has now displayed the fraud 
of her office by prejudging the rollbacks before securing and analyzing the 
facts. Her attack on the rollback rights of millions of California consumers 
assures that she will become a decisive political albatross around the necks of 
Republican office seekers next year." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said, "The snail's pace process announced today 
means that the rate rollbacks consumers demanded in Proposition 103 are years 
away, if ever . . . California's consumers voted for real insurance reform and 
deserve a better deal." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie announced her actions at a news conference one day before a deadline 
for setting hearings or allowing automatic exemptions from the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she is granting Proposition 103 exemptions to 183 small 
companies, most of which do less than $20 million in annual California 
business. No further proceedings are in prospect for them. They simply do not 
have to refund any money to their California customers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gillespie called hearings for 13 companies and filed an intent to 
hold hearings for 34 others. She said she believes these firms ought to be 
subject to rollback orders totaling more than $800 million, most of it in other 
than auto insurance lines, such as homeowners, commercial and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 companies are seven companies Gillespie has tentatively ordered to 
give a total of $305 million in rollbacks, subject to hearings. Gillespie said 
these companies, including Allstate, Safeco, 20th Century and USAA, are among 
the most efficient sellers, which accordingly make higher than normal profits. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner projected that $815 million in rollbacks will eventually be 
ordered, compared to about $4 billion that would have resulted if Proposition 
103's call for a 20% rollback of premiums from 1987 levels were fully 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie remarked that she has come under fire from investors who note that 
the rollback procedure she is following penalizes the more efficient companies. 
But, she said, she is circumscribed by a recent state Supreme Court decision 
that said companies were entitled to relief if they could show that the 
rollbacks would prevent them from earning "a fair rate of return." 
</P>
<P>
Inefficient companies are likely to receive a lower return than efficient ones, 
but Gillespie has set a flat 11.2% annual return as the standard she will use 
for all companies, ignoring consumer group suggestions that she not give credit 
for company inefficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
The other 219 companies that filed for exemptions, including the three big 
sellers, will be put on the "slow track" hearing process that could take 10 
years to complete. Actually, Gillespie said, by Nov. 8 she only expects to 
complete the 13 hearings she already has scheduled. Out of these, she said, her 
rollback guidelines will come. 
</P>
<P>
The 219 insurers on the slow track are companies that Gillespie said she does 
not believe have sufficient profit levels to give rollbacks. She remarked that 
she was agreeing to eventual hearings for these companies only because Van de 
Kamp and State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis had formally demanded 
them under provisions of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of California politicians have petitioned the department," Gillespie 
remarked disdainfully. "The requests were unnecessary; the paper work 
redundant." 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp and Collis said they believed they were right in calling for 
the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"The only good news is that, at my request, (these) requests for exemption from 
the new law will not be granted until at least some hearing occurs, although no 
schedule yet exists for that review, which the commissioner conceded could drag 
on as long as 10 years," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likely Candidate 
</P>
<P>
Collis, a prospective candidate for the commissioner's post when it becomes 
elective next year, said, "If Voter Revolt and other consumer groups, the 
attorney general and I hadn't intervened on behalf of consumers, she apparently 
would have granted all the exemption requests. 
</P>
<P>
"We have felt that Commissioner Gillespie is biased in favor of the insurance 
industry," Collis added. "But now the industry is running the department." 
</P>
<P>
Another prospective contender for the Democratic nomination for commissioner, 
television commentator Bill Press, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think she (Gillespie) ought to resign . . . She is defying the law and the 
will the voters. She has prejudged the issue. I don't trust her numbers. I 
don't think she's done the independent analysis of the numbers the insurers 
have given her that is required. It's an act of political suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, head of Voter Revolt and the author of Proposition 103, 
said, "Gillespie must go. (She) has now proven herself to be hopelessly biased 
toward the insurance industry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Independent studies show that State Farm, Farmers and the Auto Club are among 
the most highly profitable insurance companies in California. Their rates have 
been excessive for many years. Yet Gillespie claims that they cannot afford to 
roll back their rates. She has based her conclusions on the insurance 
industry's own phony numbers and artificial bookkeeping practices. It is a 
travesty of justice." 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie said that her department personnel had concluded, based on their 
own assessments, that the companies in question simply do not realize the 11.2% 
standard for defining a "fair rate of return." 
</P>
<P>
She said State Farm Mutual, for instance, is receiving only a 6% return on its 
California business and that Farmers "is having a problem." She did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In the news conference, Gillespie had a less confident demeanor than at many 
prior such meetings, remarking frequently that deciding on the rollbacks was an 
extremely complicated and difficult business. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have tried to do is use common sense," she said. "We have tried to 
disentangle the morass." 
</P>
<P>
Although the commissioner freely gave her estimates for how companies would 
fare during the hearing process on exemptions, she also said at one point, "We 
cannot prejudge." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, Gillespie had set hearings for Allstate, State Farm Fire and 
Casualty (a secondary State Farm company), USAA, California State Auto Assn., 
Safeco, 20th Century and Progressive Casualty, tentatively ordering the $305 
million in rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, she called for quick hearings on six other companies, United Pacific, 
United States Fidelity and Guaranty, Government Employees Insurance Co. 
(GEICO), Fireman's Fund, Century-National and Calfarm. "This new group 
represents potential rollbacks of more than $110 million to California 
policyholders," she remarked. 
</P>
<P>
The 34 other insurers served with a notice of intent to hold hearings "could 
represent about $400 million in potential rollbacks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, those companies called for hearings off the slow track appear to be 
above the 11.2% profit line she has set as the standard, Gillespie said.

BLOODY PAST INFLUENCES DWINDLING UMW;

COAL STRIKE A FIGHT UNION HAS TO, BUT MAY NOT, WIN

<P>
John Evans felt like he had walked into the devil's den. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a beefy home repair contractor with a disdain for labor unions, was 
sitting in one of his favorite bars when he noticed from the conversation that 
he was surrounded by a couple dozen union men -- members of the international 
board of the United Mine Workers, in town for a quarterly convention. 
</P>
<P>
All of the talk was about the stalemated strike the UMW has been running since 
April against the Pittston Coal Group in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky 
over issues ranging from mandatory overtime to pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Although the strike involves only about 1,900 men -- less than 4% of the UMW's 
ranks -- it has become a cause celebre of organized labor. Once again, a union 
with a tradition of hard bargaining is facing corporate demands for concessions 
based on the ever-more-popular contention that global competition makes the old 
rules of the workplace outdated. 
</P>
<P>
If the miners give in -- as many experts predict they eventually will -- the 
UMW will lose much of its power to make contractual demands of major coal 
companies, and organized labor will have to withstand more public analysis of 
its steady decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittston strike attracted national attention in June and July, when 46,000 
miners at other companies in 10 Eastern states walked off their jobs in 
sympathy, drastically reducing coal production in the eastern half of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
But today the strike is bogged down, attracting few headlines beyond the coal 
country. The sympathy strikers returned to work weeks ago. The Pittston miners 
now stand in isolation, clustering in wooden picket shacks they built at each 
Pittston mine entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Desperately trying to keep the issue alive, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and 
the national presidents of several other major unions plan to get themselves 
arrested today by participating in an anti-Pittston sit-in at a Russell County, 
Va., courthouse, where they will block access to the building. 
</P>
<P>
Such plans were still being hatched when Evans, who was vaguely aware of the 
miners' soured state of affairs and who is the kind of guy who likes a little 
audacity in his life, got off his bar stool and walked to a table where Bob 
Phalen, president of UMW District 17 in Charleston, W. Va., a region famed for 
its devotion to the union, was sitting with a couple of associates. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell you guys why the public isn't on your side," Evans began, 
drawing several stares of incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
Evans wanted to tell a story he had heard from somebody else -- how a miner had 
been heard bragging about how he slept on the job and how his union would 
protect him. Obviously, Evans had the wrong audience, but for a reason he 
didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
Evans wanted to talk in the present tense, but, in coal strikes, the present 
cannot be separated from the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debts of Next Generation 
</P>
<P>
Every coal strike is a history lesson. The struggles of the 99 years of the UMW 
are wordlessly trotted out as debts that the next generation of an ever-smaller 
fraternity of men must pay. Too many uncles and fathers and grandfathers have 
stories to tell. Too many miners -- 100,000, according to the union -- have 
died in the mines in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the post office in the isolated little hollow of Matewan, W. Va., for 
example, there is a plaque commemorating what is often regarded as the 
bloodiest struggle of the American labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, a handful of striking miners bent on bringing the UMW into Mingo 
County shot it out with coal company security agents who had come to evict 
strikers from company housing. Ultimately, the struggle moved to Blair 
Mountain, where four battalions of federal troops were called in before an army 
of 10,000 miners agreed to lay down its arms. 
</P>
<P>
It was with this symbolism in mind two months ago that thousands of Pittston 
strikers and their supporters assembled at Blair Mountain and marched north for 
days to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Flood of Liquid Waste 
</P>
<P>
The next county over from Mingo is Logan County. There, at the head of Buffalo 
Creek, someone has hung a wooden grave marker on a slab of land next to the 
entrance to a Pittston coal-processing facility. The grave marker recounts how 
a dam of liquid coal waste maintained by Pittston broke here in 1972 and wiped 
out the entire hollow, leaving 125 people dead and thousands homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The handwritten grave marker adds one more sentence: 
</P>
<P>
 Now Pittston wants the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of sentiment makes the UMW "more tradition-bound than any union I 
know," said William Miernyk, economics professor emeritus at West Virginia 
University. To any union, so-called contractual "give-backs" are emotional. To 
the UMW, they are treason. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittston strike grew out of the company's refusal last year to sign a 
national agreement reached between the union and the Bituminous Coal Operators 
Assn., a group of 14 companies that includes some of the country's biggest coal 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Special Concessions 
</P>
<P>
Pittston, the nation's second-leading coal exporter, contends that it needs 
special concessions from the UMW to cut labor costs in order to remain 
profitable in the international coal market. It wants to end prohibitions on 
Sunday work and mandatory overtime, two work rules dear to the union's heart. 
It insists also that it should no longer have to contribute to an industrywide 
trust fund that provides benefits to thousands of Pittston retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are sporadic and unproductive. Pittston accuses the mine workers 
of being inflexible. The union accuses Pittston of being greedy. The two sides 
won't even sit in the same room. Pittston on Friday said it would not negotiate 
for 10 days to protest what it called continued union-sanctioned violence 
against strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 mine workers and family members have been arrested for illegal 
picketing. Pittston is using strikebreakers, tough court restrictions on 
picketing, an expensive private security force and the aid of state troopers to 
continue hauling some coal out of its Virginia mines. 
</P>
<P>
The company, supported by its parent corporation, the Pittston Co., which owns 
Brinks Home Security and Burlington Air Express, says it can hold out two 
years. Miners, living on $200-a-week strike pay from a $100-million union 
strike fund, say they can, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Victory Seen 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a settlement, but it will be on management's terms," said Leo 
Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
"The mine workers live in communities that are extremely devoted to the union," 
Troy said, "but they're looking at a history that isn't going to repeat 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
To labor and industry observers, Pittston's demand for concessions took 
advantage of a weakened union that is trapped in a downward spiral. In the 
1970s, the UMW had 250,000 members and produced 70% of the nation's coal; 
today, because of layoffs due to improved technology and the growth of 
non-union strip-mining in the West, only about 70,000 union miners remain, 
producing only about a third of the nation's coal. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how UMW President Richard Trumka responded to Pittston's demands, he 
could not win, Miernyk and Troy said. If the union had avoided a strike by 
making a separate deal with Pittston, other members of the national coal 
operators' association would probably have demanded similar concessions in the 
next contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Call National Strike 
</P>
<P>
Once the union struck Pittston -- after working 14 months without a contract -- 
the spontaneous sympathy strikes at other companies temporarily put pressure on 
Pittston to return to the bargaining table. But the UMW cannot call a national 
strike to duplicate this pressure; that would violate its contract with the 
coal operators' association. 
</P>
<P>
In the formative years of the mine workers' union, its president, the legendary 
John L. Lewis, assailed coal bosses as troglodytes -- outdated relics who would 
be dragged into a more enlightened age of better treatment by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Today, inside Pittston's headquarters on a huge grassy hill in Lebanon, Va., 
Pittston Coal Group's president, Michael Odom, is trying to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
Odom, a boyish-looking 38-year-old Georgia Tech and Harvard Business School 
graduate who holds daily press briefings during the strike and likes to call 
reporters by their first names, contends that the UMW is the dinosaur, a 
prisoner of its past. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything they're doing is ducking reality," he proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
Wages are not the issue. Pittston is willing to pay the going rate, about $630 
a week. But the company insists that, to achieve "continuous production," it 
needs to require Sunday work and be able to order overtime as needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union Seeks Special Clause 
</P>
<P>
The union, which believes Pittston is systematically transferring coal reserves 
to non-union subsidiaries to slowly reduce its union work force, is demanding a 
"successorship clause," a device many unions seek to guarantee job security. 
The clause, which Pittston will not add, would pledge that, if the coal group 
sold any of its 12 unionized coal companies, the new owner would honor the 
union contract and keep the union work force. 
</P>
<P>
But the most emotional issue is Pittston's demand to reduce costs by ending its 
participation in retirement and benefit funds jointly maintained by the coal 
producers' association. Pittston wants to install its own pension and health 
plan. The union says Pittston's withdrawal would jeopardize the fund by putting 
additional pressure on the remaining coal companies. 
</P>
<P>
When its union contract expired early last year, Pittston cut off medical 
benefits to retirees and widows, a decision that was not reversed for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a credit card that expired," a Pittston spokesman said. "Theirs 
expired." 
</P>
<P>
Such remarks have not been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"They get on us for violence? Hell, that's what I call violence -- what happens 
to these old people laying at home and dying because they don't have money for 
a doctor," said Bernard Evans, a Logan County union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strikers Watch TV 
</P>
<P>
On a hot, humid day, Evans, a big, bearded man, drove his pickup truck through 
the narrow, meandering roads of his native county, stopping at each picket 
shack, visiting with strikers who wait out the days by watching television or 
whittling or swatting mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
The men, most wearing camouflage fatigues, long ago quit assuming that the 
strike would end early. They were bitter at Pittston -- particularly at Odom, 
its president, who supervised some of the Logan County operations a few years 
ago -- but felt as though they had no other cards to play. This was a last 
gasp. 
</P>
<P>
"I can wait as long as Odom can," said one miner, Robert Necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just about the UMW. It's about organized labor," said another, 
James Doczi. "Where else can I go?" 
</P>
<P>
The next night, down in Virginia, was the night that John Evans (no relation to 
Bernard) walked into the bar full of UMW leaders and began to talk about why 
the public wasn't on the miners' side, why people didn't trust unions, why the 
UMW had an image problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Phalen, the Charleston-area district president, a taciturn man, remained 
quiet. But it was late and everyone had drunk several rounds and, eventually, 
one of Phalen's assistants, Danny Wells, an organizer in Logan County, couldn't 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
He began grilling Evans about whether Evans paid his laborers union wages, 
whether Evans had ever seen a mine, whether he knew what it was like to work in 
a 36-inch-wide hole, whether he knew what it was like to work in water up to 
his waist. 
</P>
<P>
Finally Phalen spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
The hell with what the public thinks, he said, using an expletive. Hell, he 
told John Evans, my best friend was killed in a mine. How could the public know 
what that meant? Did the public know what the union had done to make mines 
safer? Did the public know that a miner still gets killed somewhere every week? 
Did the public know how many times miners had struck to keep their Sundays 
free, to guard against unrestricted overtime? Did the public think the miners 
were supposed to give this up without a fight, like so many file clerks? 
</P>
<P>
The conversation disintegrated into hazy rhetoric until four Canadian miners at 
the next table, overhearing the tumult, began to sing a dirge about a cave-in. 
It ended like this: 
</P>
<P>
 All the town cries 
</P>
<P>
 For the 10 men who died in the mine, 
</P>
<P>
 But all the town sighs 
</P>
<P>
 For the one man alive in the mine. 
</P>
<P>
And then, for several moments, nobody said anything.

COLOMBIA BID TO EXTRADITE DRUG FIGURE TO U.S. STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombian authorities acted Tuesday to send the only major figure arrested so 
far in a nationwide crackdown against drug cartels to the United States for 
trial, but the legal move has been stalled because Washington has not yet filed 
a formal extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian legal papers against Eduardo Martinez Romero, known as the "finance 
minister" of the notorious Medellin cartel, were filed with the U.S. Embassy in 
Bogota and with the Justice Ministry, according to Col. Oscar Carmona, chief of 
the national police force's judicial investigation division. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has been indicted by an federal grand jury in Atlanta in a 
$1.2-billion money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. narcotics expert and an American official who spoke to reporters in 
Bogota both said the procedure has been stymied by the United States' failure 
to request Martinez's extradition. 
</P>
<P>
After a U.S.-Colombian extradition treaty was nullified in 1987 by the 
Colombian Supreme Court, American authorities stopped filing extradition papers 
against the estimated hundreds of Colombians subsequently indicted on drug 
charges, the two said. 
</P>
<P>
The extradition treaty was restored by President Virgilio Barco Vargas in one 
of a number of emergency decrees last week. Martinez's extradition is being 
widely viewed as a test of the Barco government's new procedures and of its 
resolve in taking on the drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
But the American drug expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, warned 
that unless the U.S. request is expedited, Martinez stands a chance of being 
released. Under the emergency decree, drug-trafficking suspects can be held 
only seven days without charges. Martinez, who was arrested Saturday, faces no 
criminal charges in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the United States has opened 
discussions with Colombia on what documents it will need to extradite any of 
those apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh also issued a list of the "dozen most-wanted" Colombian 
drug-trafficking kingpins sought by the United States for prosecution in the 
wake of Barco's emergency decree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Cartels 
</P>
<P>
The 12 included the leaders of the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels, the 
organizations believed responsible for the bulk of the cocaine being smuggled 
into the United States and for the killings of political, judicial and police 
officials that Thornburgh said has brought Colombia "to its knees." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's victims of drug-related violence included Sen. Luis Carlos Galan of 
the ruling Liberal Party, the front-running candidate for next year's 
presidential election and an outspoken opponent of the cartels, and the police 
commander of the state in which Medellin is located. Fearing extradition to 
other nations, drug dealers have been able to effectively halt prosecution in 
Colombia through assassination, bribery and threats. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said Tuesday that he is furnishing the U.S. list to Colombian 
authorities and to Interpol "in recognition of the possibility that they have 
already fled Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the whereabouts of any of these individuals," Thornburgh said. 
"These drug kingpins have the means to flee to any corner of the globe." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 31, was arrested in a raid on a rural estate in Tolu, on the 
Caribbean coast about 450 miles north of Bogota, and is being held under heavy 
security at national police headquarters. In an interview with a local 
reporter, Martinez declared, "At no time have I had links to the Medellin 
cartel, and I don't know any of its members." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Martinez was indicted in the United States along with 
suspected Medellin drug barons Pablo Escobar, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez and 
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and the others reportedly ran a company, La Mina, organized to launder 
billions of dollars in cocaine profits made in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and 
New York. Last spring, however, he unwittingly led federal undercover agents to 
the money-laundering operation. In March, agents charged dozens of suspects 
with drug and currency violations and seized tens of millions of dollars in 
bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Martinez managed to avoid arrest in Panama, the official said. If 
extradited now, he would be the first drug suspect sent from Colombia to the 
United States since the extradition treaty was annulled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Two months before the Colombian court overturned the treaty, Carlos Lehder -- 
believed to be one of the leaders of the Medellin cartel -- was extradited to 
the United States. He was tried on cocaine-smuggling charges in Jacksonville, 
Fla., last year and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Under Barco's emergency decree, "the quickest thing they could do is put some 
guy on a plane and deliver him to the United States," Robert S. Ross Jr., 
Thornburgh's executive assistant, said. Or, he added, Colombia could require 
the same kind of documentation that had been necessary under the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"Facing trial in the United States is what these drug lords fear the most," 
Thornburgh said. "This list of a dozen priority offenders is only the first 
phase of our extradition efforts. Our review of those whom we seek for trial is 
ongoing, and the list is likely to be supplemented in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday: "Although 
Martinez is not a major figure, we are pleased with his capture. (We) look 
forward to bringing the major kingpins before the U.S. criminal justice 
system." 
</P>
<P>
The list issued by Thornburgh included Escobar, 39, Ochoa, 40, and Gacha, 42. 
Three reputed top officials of the smaller Cali cartel also are being sought 
for prosecution in the United States -- Gilberto Jose Rodriguez Orjuela, 50; 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orjuela, 45, and Jose Santacruz Londono, 45. Jamie Raul 
Orjuela Caballero, 46, an alleged Cali cartel member, is also on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Four other reputed members of the Medellin cartel are being sought -- Fabio 
Ochoa Vasquez, 32, and Juan David Ochoa Vasquez, 41, both brothers of Jorge 
Luis Ochoa Vasquez; Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria Rivero, 42, and Gerardo Moncada, 
42. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Ivan Duarte Acero, 37, a former police officer who allegedly works with 
the Medellin cartel and is suspected of attempting to murder two U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration agents in Colombia, is also on the list. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department estimated that 80 Colombian traffickers face U.S. 
charges, but no move has been made to extradite them because of the 1987 
ruling. Under Barco's emergency measures, the Colombian government has the 
authority to extradite drug dealers without judicial review, relieving the 
besieged Colombian judiciary of responsibility. Since 1981, drug traffickers 
have been held responsible for the deaths of 220 judges, magistrates and 
judicial aides. 
</P>
<P>
So far, according to police, about 11,000 people have been arrested since the 
sweep began last week. Barco, who invoked the emergency powers under the state 
of siege in effect since 1984, also authorized seizure of the property of 
alleged drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a U.S. Air Force plane is in Bogota, ready to transport defendants 
extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troop Refusal 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes repeated Colombia's 
refusal of American military assistance in the anti-drug campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombian government will not ask for or permit the presence of foreign 
troops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Colombia needs most to fight the powerful cartels, Thornburgh said: 
"In my view, the drug cartels are sustained by the enormous appetite for drugs 
that exists, mostly in the United States. Every cocaine sniffer and crack 
smoker in this country contributes to the violence and the enormous profits 
that are reaped by the Colombian drug traffickers."

Tau Kappa Epsilon, the nation's largest college social fraternity, announced 
that it had ended pledging in an effort to stop dangerous hazing, making it the 
second fraternity in a week to do so. "We have tried numerous programs to 
eradicate (hazing) from the fraternity, but so far none have accomplished the 
task," said T.J. Schmitz, the group's executive vice president. Legislation 
banning pledging was passed by undergraduate delegates from the fraternity's 
more than 280 chapters at the national convention in Indianapolis last weekend. 
Instead of a pledge period, TKE recruits will be initiated immediately. TKE has 
more than 177,000 initiated members and 16,000 active undergraduate members. 
Last week, Zeta Beta Tau announced that it was eliminating the traditional 
pledge period.

Lindy Chamberlain, the woman Meryl Streep portrayed in the 1988 movie "A Cry In 
The Dark," says she is still owed millions of dollars in compensation nearly a 
year after she was pardoned in the death of her infant daughter. Chamberlain, 
who says her 6-week-old baby was snatched by a dingo, or wild dog, during a 
1980 camping trip, told journalists in Sydney, Australia, that the Northern 
Territory government, which prosecuted her and later pardoned her, has not paid 
the compensation she was promised for the 3 1/2 years she spent in jail. News 
leaks have put the amount of compensation at about $3 million. Chamberlain, 41, 
said she has not received much money from eight best-sellers about the case or 
from the film. Her husband, Michael, 45, a former Seventh-Day Adventist Church 
pastor, said he has eked out a living by chopping and selling firewood. "People 
think a couple so famous should be rich," she said.

 -- Cedar Rapids, Iowa, police had a weighty problem when they arrested 
7-foot-4, 540-pound professional wrestler Andrae Rene Roussimoff, known as 
Andre the Giant, after an altercation with a TV cameraman. "Thank God he was 
cooperative in the arrest!" said Jim Barnes, the assistant police chief. "A guy 
that big, he could cause some damage." Officers did encounter some difficulty, 
however. "At first we didn't know if he could get in the back of the squad 
car," police Capt. David Johnson said. "We have trouble getting big guys in our 
patrol cars, and he's quite a bit bigger than our normal big guy. We had to fit 
him into the car sideways." Roussimoff, 43, was charged with assault and 
criminal mischief and released on $1,200 bond. Barnes said Roussimoff became 
upset when Ben Hildebrandt, a cameraman for Cedar Rapids station KCRG, who was 
filming during a match between Roussimoff and the Ultimate Warrior, who won. 
Roussimoff told Hildebrandt that it was illegal to film the match, Barnes said. 
He said the two men exchanged words and then Roussimoff put a headlock on the 
cameraman. -- A $38.8-million hospital in Orlando, Fla., for critically ill 
newborns and women with high-risk pregnancies is preparing to open, thanks 
partly to golfer Arnold Palmer. He led the fund-raising for the 255-bed Arnold 
Palmer Hospital for Children &amp; Women, billed as one of four of its kind in 
the nation. About $4.5 million can be attributed directly to his association 
with the project, foundation director George Maynard said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

The Bulgarian government accused Turkey of playing "a dirty political game" 
with its decision requiring that ethnic Turks immigrating from Bulgaria first 
obtain visas. However, the semiofficial Turkish news agency Anatolia said 522 
ethnic Turks were allowed to cross without visas. The refugees say they are 
fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign. The Turkish government announced its 
move Monday, saying it would require the visas because Bulgaria's Communist 
leaders have refused to start talks on an accord to protect the emigrants. 
Turkish officials said the border will stay closed until Sofia signs an 
emigration pact with Ankara safeguarding the rights of ethnic Turks wanting to 
emigrate and of those staying behind.

The Red Cross and the Swiss government appealed for an end to violations of the 
Geneva Conventions requiring humane treatment of prisoners of war and civilians 
under military occupation. Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, appeared to direct his remarks mainly at Iran and 
Iraq, who are still holding POWs despite a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War a 
year ago. "Tens of thousands of prisoners of war wait in camps. Thousands, some 
after years of internment, are wounded or sick. They have become hostages of 
international negotiations," he said at a ceremony in Bern, Switzerland, to 
mark the signing of the first Geneva Convention in 1864.

Afghan President Najibullah outlined a new peace plan and called for an 
international conference to back the search for a political solution of the 
11-year-old Afghanistan conflict. The refined version of an old peace plan, 
which had been rejected by Afghan rebels and Washington, calls for negotiations 
with the rebels to form a consultative council, followed by a six-month 
cease-fire during which the council would set up a broad-based government to 
draft a constitution and an electoral law.

A federal judge denied the National Wildlife Federation's request that the 
Commerce Department be ordered to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to 
equip their nets with turtle excluder devices, or TEDs, to protect endangered 
sea turtles from drowning. Wildlife Federation attorney Robert Irvin said he 
would appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Five conservation groups, 
meanwhile, filed suit in federal court against Commerce Secretary Robert A. 
Mosbacher, alleging his suspension of regulations that require shrimpers to use 
TEDs was unlawful.

The President's Advisory Commission on Federal Pay said that the pay gap 
between the federal government and the private sector has grown to 28.6%, the 
Washington Post reported. The cost of implementing a pay increase of that 
magnitude would be $35 billion in the first year, according to the Office of 
Personnel Management. Congress has agreed on a 3.6% annual increase next 
January, and the White House is expected to go along. The annual report is 
supposed to trigger an automatic increase to bring federal employees up to 
"comparability" with private workers. However, federal workers have not 
received full comparability increases since 1977.

COURTROOM CHAINS ENTITLE SPAIN TO NEW TRIAL, APPEALS JUDGES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Black Panther Johnny Spain should not have been compelled to wear 
shackles while on trial for murdering two San Quentin prison guards and is 
entitled to a new trial, a federal appeals court in Pasadena ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
By a 2-1 vote, the U.S. 9th Circuit of Appeals upheld a 1986 lower-court 
decision that the 25 pounds of chains Spain was required to wear 10 to 12 hours 
daily during legal proceedings had prejudiced the jury against him and made it 
difficult for Spain to assist in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Due process requires that shackling be imposed only as a last resort," Judge 
Cynthia Holcomb Hall wrote in the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The judge stated that the shackling, which spanned nearly four years of 
pre-trial proceedings and a 17-month trial, was "unparalleled" and not 
necessary for courtroom security. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who was joined in the appellate ruling by Judge Alex Kozinski, said that 
Marin County Superior Court Judge Henry Broderick failed to utilize the less 
onerous alternative of excluding Spain from the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hall noted that Spain had filed motions in which he said he was willing to give 
up his 6th Amendment right to confront his accusers in order to avoid the 
chaining. 
</P>
<P>
Now 40, Spain was convicted in 1976 of murdering two guards and of conspiracy 
to escape San Quentin by force and violence in one of the most celebrated 
prison cases of the 1970s. Spain was acquitted of three other murder charges 
and an assault charge. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of six inmates who were dubbed the "San Quentin Six," after they 
were accused of murder, conspiracy and assault stemming from a bloody incident 
on Aug. 21, 1971, in which three guards and three inmates were killed during an 
escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
One of those killed was inmate George Jackson, a black revolutionary writer who 
authored the book "Soledad Brother." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was shot down as he attempted to flee San Quentin after taking over the 
solitary confinement unit with a gun he produced after a visit with one of his 
attorneys. The attorney, Stephen M. Bingham, was later acquitted of murder and 
conspiracy charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Spain's inmate co-defendants were acquitted of all charges against 
them, while two others were convicted of lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, all six men were chained around the legs, wrists and waist 
and the chains were clearly visible to the jurors. Spectators and reporters 
were required to pass through metal detectors before entering the courtroom at 
Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael and they were separated from the 
participants by bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
The security measures were taken, in part, because a Marin County judge had 
been killed at the same courthouse in 1970 when George Jackson's brother, 
Jonathan, took over a courtroom and attempted to exchange the judge, a 
prosecutor and a juror for his brother and other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's ruling, Hall acknowledged that Broderick was justifed in his 
concerns about courtroom security but said the judge could have taken up 
Spain's request to be excluded from the trial. She also noted that since 
testimony showed that Spain's health deteriorated during the trial, the judge 
could have allowed Spain to stay away periodically to regain his strength. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Dissent 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Judge John Noonan, meanwhile, issued a strong dissent to Hall's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no authority to second-guess the procedure chosen and to overturn a 
verdict of murder fairly rendered 13 years ago," Noonan wrote. He further 
asserted that trying Spain without chains would have put the prosecutors, 
judge, jury and bailiffs at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, who has been free on $350,000 bail since March of 1988, expressed 
satisfaction after hearing of Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really very happy," he said in a telephone interview from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Spain said he has been working as an electrician and that next week he will 
start teaching a course entitled, "Society Behind Bars" at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on an entirely different page now," Spain said, referring to his new life. 
"It is a question of adapting myself to normal society. Nothing about my life 
has been normal." 
</P>
<P>
Spain had served a total of 21 years in prison. He was convicted of murder in 
1966 when he was only 17. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Dennis Riordan, who has worked on the San Quentin case for 13 
years, said he was elated that "the practice of chaining a black man in an 
American courtroom has been disapproved." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the court victory Tuesday, Spain's legal battles are far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Marin County Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry Boren, who once helped prosecute the San 
Quentin case, said that the state attorney general's office will petition the 
entire 11 members of the 9th Circuit to rehear the case. Such review is at the 
discretion of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Boren also said that prosecutors are prepared, if need be, to go to the U.S. 
Supreme Court and, if unsuccessful there, to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
Boren called Tuesday's ruling "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"If the jury was prejudiced against Spain (because of the shackles)," Boren 
said, "they wouldn't have acquitted him of some of the charges."

KILLER WHALE BLED TO DEATH AFTER BREAKING JAW IN FIGHT

Kandu the killer whale died from massive bleeding caused by a freak injury 
when, showing "normal behavior," she attacked a larger female whale that she 
was attempting to dominate, Sea World officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain said Kandu, who weighed about 4,600 pounds, 
attacked Corky, her 7,000-pound rival, during the 4 p.m. show at the park 
Monday. McBain said trainers saw the whales fight in a holding pen behind the 
main pool midway into the 25-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
The trainers reported seeing Kandu charge into Corky with her mouth open. The 
impact fractured Kandu's upper jaw, causing fatal hemorrhaging of major 
arteries in the whale's nasal passages, McBain said. The veterinarian said 
there was nothing park officials could do to save Kandu. 
</P>
<P>
As thousands of spectators watched, Kandu spouted blood that stained the water 
and the sides of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
"The altercation was initiated by Kandu. She was asserting her dominance by 
going after Corky with her mouth open," McBain said. "It's common behavior. For 
the survival of any species, the stronger animal has to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The death was an unexpected shock, but the altercation was not a rare event at 
all. It was normal behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials said Kandu had repeatedly exerted her dominance since Corky 
was brought to the park from Marineland three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While Sea World officials characterized the whale death as an accident 
resulting from normal whale behavior, critics took the opportunity to reopen 
the debate over whether these mammals should be kept in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sea World officials briefly considered canceling the park's 
trademark whale shows. But McBain said the suggestion was rejected when 
trainers argued that it would be better for the remaining three whales "if we 
continued with a normal day." The shows continued Tuesday morning, but there 
were no trainers in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many park visitors interviewed Tuesday in the killer whale stadium said they 
were unaware of Kandu's death. Park officials said they are currently in their 
peak season and attendance was normal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to McBain, the fatal collision between the two whales only took about 
five seconds, but Kandu lingered for about 45 minutes before she died. The orca 
made news last September when she gave birth to Baby Shamu during a 
performance. The birth was videotaped, and the marine park has been using it in 
its advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Baby Shamu was still nursing, Sea World officials said 
they were confident that Kandu's death will not have an adverse effect on the 
young whale. McBain said Baby Shamu is eating about 40 to 45 pounds of solid 
food a day and is staying with Corky at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, she (Baby Shamu) realizes that something is different. She appears 
to be awaiting her mother, but we think she'll do all right at the end," McBain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Corky, who is believed to be in her mid to late 20s, suffered superficial cuts 
but was otherwise unhurt in the incident, McBain said. Kandu was believed to be 
14 years old and had given birth in 1986 to a baby that was stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
Killer whales' social structure is dominated by females, and the only males 
allowed in a pod are transient breeders and babies. McBain said it was natural 
for a younger female like Kandu to assert her dominance over an older one like 
Corky. 
</P>
<P>
McBain said that at first, it was not apparent to the trainers that Kandu had 
been injured in the brief confrontation with Corky. No trainers were in the 
water when the fight occurred, Sea World officials said. About two minutes 
after the two made contact, both mammals briefly chased each other in the main 
pool but did not touch again, McBain added. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, trainers and thousands of horrified spectators in Shamu Stadium 
saw blood streaming from Kandu's blowhole. While one trainer directed Kandu and 
Baby Shamu back to the holding pen, another stayed with Corky, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, owners of the four Sea Worlds and two other theme 
parks, are currently looking for a buyer to take over the attractions. Analysts 
and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich officials downplayed the financial impact of the 
whale's death and its possible effects on the sale of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Sea World has 16 other whales, including five calves born 
in captivity over the last two years. Kandu, who was valued at about $1 
million, was not insured. 
</P>
<P>
A necropsy was done on Kandu Monday night. McBain said veterinarians found 
nothing unusual with Kandu's internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
Kandu's death was the second whale fatality at Sea World in less than a year. 
Orky, a male whale who accompanied Corky when Sea World bought Marineland, died 
last September, three days after Kandu gave birth to Baby Shamu. Orky sired 
Baby Shamu. A necropsy revealed that Orky, who was about 30 and the oldest 
killer whale in captivity at the time, died from natural causes.

DEVELOPERS' MOVES SEEN AS THREAT TO TRANSIT PLAN 
</P>

<P>
A behind-the-scenes effort by development interests to modify an $18.5-billion 
transportation program has environmentalists and a legislative architect of the 
plan worried that the changes could unravel the unprecedented agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the latest concern is a little-noticed provision in the massive 
transportation program that places a major new responsibility on large 
developers to reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
It requires local governments to assess the effect that new developments will 
have on traffic congestion and then to work out an agreement with the developer 
to mitigate that impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Impact on Traffic' 
</P>
<P>
"It significantly changes the way developers do business in California today," 
said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the author of the congestion 
provisions and Assembly Transportation Committee chairman. "We started out in 
the beginning saying you had to link land-use and transportation and the 
environment together. . . . You have to take into account the impact on 
traffic, both locally and regionally. You can't continue with some sort of 
Western boom town mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Building and development interests, while applauding the goal of the 
legislation, contend it is unworkable in its present form. They are seeking 
legislation that they characterize as "tidying it up a little." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very much concerned about those provisions in the sense that we think 
they could probably be made a little more realistic in certain circumstances," 
said Donald V. Collin, a lobbyist for the California Building Industry Assn. He 
conceded that his group has not determined yet exactly what changes it will 
seek or how extensive they will be. 
</P>
<P>
Katz and environmentalists said they fear what the developers really have in 
mind is a wholesale weakening of what they consider a critical element of the 
transportation program. It could prompt them, they said, to actively oppose the 
whole program. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation program, which includes a 9-cent hike in the state's 
gasoline tax, does not become effective unless voters approve changes in the 
state's spending limit at a June, 1990, election. Any strong opposition could 
jeopardize passage of the measure that so far, according to opinion polls, 
appears to have only lukewarm support from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year transportation program would provide money for new streets and 
highways, mass transit construction, state and local road maintenance and 
measures to improve the efficiency of streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Environmental Components' 
</P>
<P>
Mike Paparian, state director for the California Sierra Club, said the 
congestion management program is one of the few "environmental components" that 
remained after Democratic and Republican legislative leaders and Gov. George 
Deukmejian hammered out a final compromise earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Removing or tinkering with that portion would likely push us into an 
opposition mode," Paparian said. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides acknowledged that the congestion management program provides a 
radical new approach to building and development in California that will pile 
additional costs on developers, realign growth patterns in some communities and 
force local governments to give greater consideration to the impact that large 
projects will have on the transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major departure from current policy," says David Ackerman, a lobbyist 
for the Associated General Contractors of California who is acting as the 
coordinator between lawmakers and business groups who want changes in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure would require local governments through computer modeling to 
determine how many additional vehicle trips a large residential or commercial 
development project will add to both the surrounding and the regional 
transportation system. It applies only to urbanareas. 
</P>
<P>
Before local governments could approve a new project, the developer must agree 
to lessen or "mitigate" the impact of the additional traffic on the regional 
transportation system. Local governments have an array of options to force the 
developer to do this. They can assess fees to be used to expand the 
transportation system or require such things as van pooling, flexible working 
hours and the creation of transportation management associations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, local governments would also be required to establish congestion 
levels for various zones in their city. If a zone is already at near gridlock 
-- designated by the federal government as a level F -- it may remain at that 
level. If not, each zone must be at least a level E, which means heavy 
congestion but not gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
If a development will force changes in the traffic levels that exceed that 
permitted for the local zone in which it is located, the developer must also 
agree to a "mitigation" plan for that zone. Local governments that fail to 
comply with the congestion management requirements could lose their share of 
new road construction funds generated by the gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people in the development community express the attitude that they just 
develop things; they don't know where all the people come from," Katz said. 
"But there is a correlation between office buildings and trips, between housing 
and trips, between shopping centers and cars. What this bill says is that from 
now on in California those additional vehicles on the road are going to be 
offset. And we're not going to let it get any worse, and we might even let it 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Modeling 
</P>
<P>
But Collin says builders and developers are worried that the computer modeling 
may be inaccurate or vary from city to city. He said it is also unclear what 
data will be used to determine levels of congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking at undoing (the program)," he said. "We're trying to make 
sure it works well so it becomes doable." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Fitzpatrick, senior director of transportation for the Irvine Co., said 
that building and development interests are not alone in their concerns about 
the program but that a broad group of business interests, including chambers of 
commerce, manufacturers and truckers, are also pushing for changes.

NEWTON -- A STRUGGLE TO LIVE UP TO THE LEGEND 
</P>

<P>
From the moment Huey P. Newton was thrust onto the national stage after he was 
charged with killing an Oakland police officer in October, 1967, until his own 
death by gunfire there Tuesday morning, Huey Newton the man struggled 
constantly to live up to Huey Newton the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was a man who got swept up by a historical moment," recalled Elaine 
Brown, who became Newton's comrade and lover after he co-founded the Black 
Panther Party. She now works as a writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Free Huey' movement that evolved from that incident made him larger than 
life," Brown said. "Suddenly, he was forced to play the role of the 
revolutionary hero." 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, it is a role that Newton appeared to play with gusto, brandishing 
weapons, wearing his black beret and leather jacket, clenching his fist in the 
Black Power salute. But Newton's friends and associates said Tuesday that 
pressures associated with the role led to repeated clashes with police and may 
have accelerated his descent into the cocaine addiction that many of them 
assume ended up destroying him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Philosophy 
</P>
<P>
In any case, they said, Newton would be remembered for his political vision 
more than for his later personal troubles and his violent end. He was shot in 
the head early Tuesday morning on a crack-infested Oakland street. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped set the stage for what now seems the routine elections of blacks and 
other minorities to political office," said Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Oakland). "The 
Black Panther Party that he helped to found and which he led for many years 
represented a significant stage in the development of the movement for black 
political empowerment." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as a fighter for equality, humanity, equality of races, the 
dignity of black Americans, and I idolized him during those periods of times," 
added Charles Garry, Newton's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He withstood all kinds of adversity . . . and the FBI constantly harassed him 
to the point (where) they killed him from an emotional standpoint," Garry 
added. 
</P>
<P>
But to law enforcement officers, with whom Newton had clashed repeatedly, 
Newton all along was little more than a small-time gangster. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that he was no more than a thug," said Tom Orloff, a deputy 
district attorney in Alameda County who prosecuted Newton in a 1974 assault 
case. "He acted out violently against other people and abused them. He didn't 
do anything that was positive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even some of those who admired Newton as a visionary who helped to 
channel the undirected black rage of the '60s into the struggle for justice and 
against police brutality said that Newton had a self-destructive streak. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since he came back from Cuba in 1977, he was kind of out of control and 
consistently managed to self-destruct," said Dennis Riordan, an attorney to 
former Black Panther John Spain. Newton spent three years as a fugitive in Cuba 
after being charged with a series of violent crimes in 1974, including the 
fatal shooting of a 17-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't just say that Huey Newton was just another criminal who came out 
of the ghetto," added Riordan. "Lots of them did, but few of them transformed 
national politics." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "nobody is terribly surprised he died a violent death," Riordan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what accusations are made against him, he is still my friend and my 
brother," said the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial Church in San 
Francisco, who rushed to Oakland Tuesday morning to comfort Newton's wife and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Black Panthers achieved their greatest political success while 
Newton was in Cuba and Elaine Brown was running the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a leader and theoretician, but he wasn't an administrator," Brown said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Newton had emerged as a national figure in the mid-1960s after he and another 
well-known comrade, Bobby Seale, co-founded the Black Panther Party. On Oct. 
28, 1967, Newton began the first of many major encounters with the law when he 
was involved in a shoot-out with Oakland police and was charged with murder in 
the death of Officer John Frey. 
</P>
<P>
Newton's trial was held the next year under ultra-tight security at the Alameda 
County Courthouse in a courtroom jam-packed with spectators and news reporters 
from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor was an assistant district attorney, D. Lowell Jensen, who later 
became the county's top prosecutor, then went to Washington to serve as an 
assistant to Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III and who now is a federal district judge 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney was Garry, a San Francisco lawyer who was to gain fame as 
a zealous and impassioned defender of the Panthers and countless other radicals 
of the day who ended up in court. 
</P>
<P>
When the case went to the jury, Oakland braced for what it feared could be an 
explosive response in the black community if Newton were to be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Cities around the nation already had erupted into the violence that marked the 
riot-torn '60s -- and many feared the worst was yet to come in Oakland. As it 
turned out, the jurors did find Newton guilty -- but of a lesser offense that 
many interpreted as a victory for Newton: voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Newton was sentenced to from two to 15 years in prison, but his conviction was 
overturned by a state Court of Appeal on grounds that the jury was not properly 
instructed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, after spending 22 months in prison, Newton was released on $50,000 
bail pending retrial as hundreds of his supporters cheered his new-won freedom, 
chanting "Huey! Huey!" 
</P>
<P>
As he left the courthouse, Newton thrust his fist into the air and shouted the 
Panthers' by-now-familiar slogan, "Power to the People!" Ultimately, the 
charges in the officer's death were dropped after two subsequent mistrials. 
</P>
<P>
Newton once again found himself in serious trouble with the law in 1974 when he 
was charged with pistol-whipping his tailor and murdering a 17-year-old 
prostitute. But the murder and assault charges were later dropped after juries 
in the cases deadlocked. He was found guilty in 1978 of the charge of being a 
felon in possession of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, after a series of further brushes with the law, Newton found himself 
in a different sort of controversy when, after three years as a graduate 
student, he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy degree from UC Santa Cruz in 
history of consciousness, described as an interdisciplinary program on the 
history of social philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Newton's doctoral dissertation, reviewed and accepted by a panel of three 
faculty members, was entitled, "War Against the Panthers: A Study of Repression 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
A university spokeswoman said Newton's study program involved "the history of 
humanity's different cultural organizations and expressions and the analysis of 
fundamental ideas of human nature, society and community that form social 
custom." 
</P>
<P>
The degree drew letters of protest to UC Santa Cruz officials, who in turn 
defended Newton and the program under which he studied. "Mr. Newton was a 
serious and diligent student in his course work and his thesis research," said 
Chancellor Robert L. Sinsheimer. "This program is not only legitimate, but it 
is also of rather longstanding as an interdisciplinary program."

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried Tuesday to calm a political uproar in 
his Christian Democratic Party by naming a popular member of Parliament, Volker 
Ruehe, as his choice for party general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The tempest was churned up Monday when Kohl told the incumbent general 
secretary, Heinz Geissler, that his services were not wanted as chief 
strategist for next year's national election campaign.

Kohl, as chairman, is the party's overall leader. The general secretary deals 
with administrative matters and charts electoral tactics. Kohl's replacement of 
Geissler must be voted on at next month's party convention. 
</P>
<P>
Geissler, 59, who had been general secretary since 1977, was generally credited 
with trying over the past year to move the Christian Democrats somewhat to the 
left in order to attract younger voters and voters from the opposition Social 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Christian Democrats have done poorly in local and regional elections 
this year, as well as in elections for the European Parliament. They have lost 
votes to the far-right Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Kohl, notably members of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian 
branch of his party, argue that the move to the left cost the Christian 
Democrats votes among their more conservative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl was widely criticized Tuesday for dumping Geissler in order to appeal to 
people on the right. The Social Democratic general secretary, Anke Fuchs, said 
that Geissler "was sacrificed to the republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl denied this, however, declaring Tuesday that "this has nothing to do with 
a change of policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentment Charged 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that Kohl has resented Geissler's challenge to his authority 
and was not prepared to go into an election year with him as general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Geissler did not leave quietly. He told a news conference: "Against the wishes 
of the party, Kohl rejected my offer of loyal cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
He denied that he is responsible for this year's electoral defeats and said it 
is Kohl's image that is to blame. In addition, he warned the party against 
"selling its soul to pick up a few percentage points in the opinion polls." 
</P>
<P>
But some commentators suggested that Geissler had been sniping at Kohl for 
months and that Kohl had shown a rare decisiveness in dropping Geissler. 
</P>
<P>
Ruehe, 46, has served for 13 years in Parliament and is regarded as having 
special expertise in foreign affairs. But he has little experience in party 
affairs and campaign management.

The State Department issued a notice Tuesday cautioning travelers to Northern 
Ireland that threats and sabotage by the outlawed Irish Republican Army have 
interrupted rail service, especially on the Belfast-Dublin line. 
</P>
<P>
The notice said there have been no deaths or injuries to date because the 
explosive devices which have been detonated were placed on tracks and not on 
the trains, and the authorities have received warnings. 
</P>
<P>
In such instances, the tracks have been closed and alternate transportation has

Communist Party General Secretary Karoly Grosz, a centrist who has lost ground 
recently to reformists, suggested in an interview published Tuesday that he 
will step down to prevent a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz did not specifically say he would resign, but the official MTI news 
agency reported that he did not contradict a reporter for the party daily 
Nepszabadsag who asked why he intended to "leave the political scene." 
</P>
<P>
"Many people want to believe that the main cause of the current problems is the 
power struggle within the party," Grosz was quoted as saying. "I would not like 
to have a power struggle, as it would not do any good to either the party or 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on his political future or his views on the party 
conflict. But he apparently was alluding to expectations that a battle between 
reformers and their opponents would dominate an extraordinary party congress 
Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz became party general secretary 15 months ago, replacing Janos Kadar, the 
leader of 32 years who had become associated with political and economic 
stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz assumed power amid expectations he would lead reforms while maintaining 
discipline and good terms with party conservatives. But he was left behind as 
reformers forced the pace of political and economic liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the surge of reformist sentiment within the party has 
led to the endorsement of a multi-party system and of free elections, by 
mid-1990 at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
A draft manifesto published in Nepszabadsag on Friday reiterated the 
Communists' intention to "introduce a multi-party system in which the source of 
power is the will of the people manifested in free elections."

FURTHER DELAYS PLAGUE AIR FORCE TRANSPORT PLANE 
</P>

<P>
The Air Force's newest transport plane, the C-17 -- already months behind 
schedule and more than $3 billion over budget -- faces further delays because 
of production problems and glitches in complex computer software programs, 
according to a new government study. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the problems, the first flight of the C-17, built by Douglas 
Aircraft Co. of Long Beach, will be pushed back from next August to at least 
December, 1990, according to a General Accounting Office report issued this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Further delays could result if Douglas cannot solve continuing troubles with 
production tooling, assembly, flight control software and the plane's weight, 
the agency reported. Douglas Aircraft is a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. of St. Louis, the nation's largest military contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The C-17, which will cost an estimated $37.5 billion over the next 10 years, is 
one of the Pentagon's biggest procurement programs. Among current military 
projects, only the $70-billion B-2 Stealth bomber and the $69-billion "Star 
Wars" anti-missile shield are more costly. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas spokesman David Eastman called the GAO findings "nothing particularly 
new" and said that the problems are under control. He acknowledged, however, 
that the first flight would be delayed by at least four months. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been saying since the first of year that we're three to four months 
behind. We're trying to make it up, but the possibilities right now are very 
slim," Eastman said. "It's getting more and more obvious to us that we're 
probably not going to be able" to meet the August, 1990, target for the C-17's 
maiden flight. 
</P>
<P>
The first C-17 is being assembled at Douglas Aircraft's Long Beach plant, where 
8,000 workers are employed on the project, Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO cited delays in deliveries of parts as contributing to the delays. 
Douglas engineers hoped to mate the wings to the fuselage in July, for example, 
but have been forced to postpone that milestone until next January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force plans to buy 210 of the jumbo transport planes. Each will weigh 
135 tons and is designed to carry 83 tons of cargo 2,700 miles without 
refueling. The Air Force contends it needs the new cargo plane to assure that 
overseas forces can be resupplied quickly in the event of war. 
</P>
<P>
The current $37.5-billion cost estimate for the program does not include 
improvements in the plane's defensive systems that the Air Force is demanding 
on half of the 210 planes. The changes will add at least $437 million to the 
C-17's overall cost, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is currently scheduled to join the Air Force inventory in 1992, with 
the final jets to be delivered at the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not dispute the GAO's findings on program delays.

As many as 30 visitors aboard the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy were injured 
Tuesday when a platform elevator's hydraulic line broke, spewing fluid and 
causing panic among its passengers. 
</P>
<P>
None of the injuries were serious, with most apparently being minor scrapes and 
bruises, said Kristen Anderson, a spokeswoman for Port Everglades, where the 
carrier was docked. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Paul Jenkins, a spokesman for the Navy in Norfolk, Va., said about 30 
people were treated for injuries, including more than 20 who were treated by 
paramedics at the scene and others who were sent to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The elevator's hydraulic line burst shortly after 3 p.m., spraying visitors who 
had come to see the world's largest steam-powered aircraft carrier, said 
Anderson, adding that the fluid was not hot. The elevator, which is used to 
carry aircraft from the hangar bay to the flight deck, was taking between 50 
and 100 visitors from one deck of the ship to another. 
</P>
<P>
The elevator did not stop or drop when the line burst, Jenkins said, and port 
officials said panicked guests, rather than the broken fluid line, caused most 
of the injuries.

They found his squad car in a parking lot between some warehouses at 3:30 in 
the morning. Motor running, emergency flashers on, driver's door open, radio 
still crackling. 
</P>
<P>
But four days have passed now, and still there is no trace of Officer David 
Hayhurst, no clue about what happened to a routine cop on a routine night doing 
a routine job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just unheard of," said his commander, Capt. Mike O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst had asked for a special assignment last Thursday when he reported for 
his 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. night shift. He wanted to shoot radar, go out and nab 
traffic offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"That was his bag," O'Neill remembers now with a smile. Hayhurst was good at 
it. During his 17 years as a cop, he'd spent plenty of time on traffic detail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Radio 
</P>
<P>
That night, free from having to answer the usual reports of domestic disputes, 
prowlers and rowdy drunks, 39-year-old Dave Hayhurst hit the streets of 
southwest Denver in Car 418. On his way out of the station house, he grabbed a 
radio. One of the older models. One without a panic button, which alerts the 
dispatcher that an officer needs help. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst headed for the warehouse district alongside the narrow south fork of 
the Platte River, about two miles from the station house. He rounded a wide 
bend and pulled off the road to wait. In police jargon, a good hiding place to 
catch speeders is a fishin' hole. Hayhurst had just found himself one. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow officer remembers chatting with Hayhurst on the radio that evening. 
Hayhurst was gleeful. "God, I found a gold mine!" he boasted. Around 11 p.m., 
another buddy, Officer Jerry Parton, stopped to have coffee with Hayhurst at a 
nearby greasy spoon. 
</P>
<P>
"He was his usual jolly self," Parton recalled. "He kept pretending to hit my 
panic button. He was always joking around like that. He liked to sort of harass 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst's easy-going manner and sense of humor belied the special challenges 
he faced at home. The youngest of his two sons, 12-year-old Chad, had cerebral 
palsy. Hayhurst devoted himself not only to his own boy, but to all handicapped 
kids. His dogged work in putting together a special police fair for 300 
handicapped children earned him a coveted Citizens' Appreciation Award. He was 
supposed to collect his medal in a ceremony this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radio Call 
</P>
<P>
The last anyone heard from Dave Hayhurst was 1:07 a.m. Friday, when he radioed 
in to the dispatcher. He had just completed a minor traffic stop and was ready 
to resume patrol. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:35 a.m., a citizen called in to report an abandoned police car idling 
behind some warehouses off Mississippi Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Word went out, and suddenly the eerie riverfront was alive with blue uniforms. 
Police sealed off the area, combed the car. Hayhurst's clipboard and ticket 
book were on the dash. There were no signs of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow officers shook their heads in disbelief. No cop with any street smarts 
would have ever turned into the blind alley without radioing for back-up. "Dave 
would've never fallen for a trap like that," said Parton. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else must have driven the car there and left it. But who? And why? 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters and bloodhounds joined the search. A couple of hours passed, and a 
sergeant was sent to tell Leilani Hayhurst that her husband was missing. 
</P>
<P>
It was the start of an extraordinary search, and an agonizing vigil. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, cops getting off duty at precincts all over Denver that day simply 
drove straight to the warehouses to join the search on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
The area where they concentrated -- a mile long and two miles deep -- would 
prove to be an urban maze of warehouses, junkyards, rail yards, cheap 
apartments and overgrown fields surrounded by busy thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, divers groped along the muddy bottoms of the Platte as well 
as smaller ponds and lakes. News helicopters took police up for aerial 
searches. A special hot line was set up, and the calls began pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
A mental patient led police down the railroad tracks, insisting he had 
discovered a battered, uniformed body beneath some boards. Nothing. A caller 
claimed Hayhurst's body would be found in an abandoned car near a junkyard. 
Nothing. A woman telephoned to say her 10-year-old daughter had dreamed Dave 
Hayhurst had been killed behind a Safeway. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Then an 11-year-old boy who lived in one of the apartments remembered glancing 
out his window around 1 a.m. and seeing a police car chasing a red sports car 
with gold wheels. Investigators speculate it may be the cherry-colored Datsun 
280Z three murder suspects were last seen driving in the part of town where 
Hayhurst disappeared. The men -- Donald Ferrado, 40; Michael Plunkett, 36, and 
Roger Don Hunter, 25 -- were wanted in connection with a slaying in Oroville, 
Calif., in a drug deal gone bad. It wasn't much to go on, but for now, 
investigators say it is about all they have got. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, there was a brief surge of hope when detectives knocked on the door 
of an escaped rapist in the warehouse district. The man jumped out a window and 
fled. A description went out on the radio. "Possible involvement in missing 
officer," the dispatcher said. Within seconds, a dozen police cars and 
motorcycles screeched into the neighborhood. People gathered on a corner to 
watch the chase. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the field where that cop disappeared from," offered a pregnant woman 
in a Pink Floyd T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
"That missing cop." 
</P>
<P>
"Look, there come the TV guys!" 
</P>
<P>
"Someone ought to tell them to check that tunnel where kids hide out there!" 
</P>
<P>
"They say you should tie a yellow ribbon around your car antenna and your 
mailbox as a show of faith, and maybe if the ones who did it see enough yellow 
ribbons, they'll know everybody is looking for that guy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd tie one around my antenna if I had a car." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is caught, but there is no known link to Hayhurst. 
</P>
<P>
So far, everything is leading to the same dead-end. 
</P>
<P>
To the same empty police car with its engine running.

A federal judge on Tuesday found disbarred attorney William Borders in contempt 
of court and ordered him to jail for refusing to answer questions from a Senate 
panel gathering evidence in the Alcee L. Hastings impeachment trial. U.S. 
District Judge Thomas Pennfield Jackson gave Borders until 10 a.m. Friday to 
surrender to federal marshals. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is collecting evidence concerning charges that Hastings conspired 
with Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lied about it before a jury that 
acquitted him in 1983. Borders was convicted in 1982, disbarred and sent to 
prison for 33 months. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, who was impeached by the House in August, 1988, is also accused of 
improperly disclosing information that government investigators obtained 
through a court-approved wiretap. 
</P>
<P>
Once the committee finishes its report, the full Senate will vote on whether to 
remove Hastings from the federal bench and thus take away the $89,500 annual 
salary he continues to receive.

TOWN SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED, BY BAR'S IDEA

<P>
Mondays are slow nights at Shooter's Pub, so the owners decided to try to boost 
trade by making it a "no-alcohol" night. They would bring in a disc jockey and 
serve only fruit juices and sodas. 
</P>
<P>
Then the selectmen -- who govern this Boston suburb of 5,000 residents -- 
scotched the idea. 
</P>
<P>
By a 2-0 vote, with one member abstaining, the board shot down Shooter's 
proposal, purportedly out of fear that a no-alcohol night might draw all sorts 
of undesirables and disturb the peace. 
</P>
<P>
"First they said it was because of the traffic, then they said it was the 
noise," Chris Martin, the bar's manager, said in recalling the arguments 
against the proposal. "Then they said that if people aren't drinking, then they 
must be doing drugs, and if they're not doing drugs, then they must be 
homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sober Folks Offended 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a controversy of magnum proportions that has drawn 
nationwide attention and angered nondrinkers. 
</P>
<P>
Shooter's had been all set to go with the new program late last month. Flyers 
were sent to Alcoholics Anonymous chapters; a disc jockey was hired for the 
small dance floor and invitations had been sent out to the press. 
</P>
<P>
But in a prepared statement delivered on the day of the voting earlier this 
month, Selectman William Enright, the board chairman, said of the Shooter's 
proposal: "To couch something like this in terms of a social benevolent 
activity is ridiculous. This is an attempt to turn a slow night into a money 
maker." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that was precisely the point. "I didn't portray this as a social 
project," he said. "It's a sound business decision. If I can make money, that's 
the American way." 
</P>
<P>
Selectman John DeMarco, the other opponent of the no-alcohol night, said that 
what bothered him most about the idea was that, along with the "juice bar," 
adding a third night of entertainment to the two weekend nights of 
entertainment already featured at the bar would aggravate crowds and noise. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the bar already has been the subject of some complaints of noise over 
the past two years, and had its license suspended for three days last February 
because of a cocaine bust there involving a patron and a former Shooter's 
bartender. 
</P>
<P>
"Shooter's request for an additional night of entertainment was measured 
against the backdrop of the weekend complaints and the arrests," DeMarco said 
in a letter sent to various area newspapers. "I view these violations as 
entertainment license abuses and, consequently, have no desire to increase the 
likelihood of such infractions by approving entertainment for a third night." 
</P>
<P>
Selectman James Geary, who abstained from voting on the Shooter's plan, had 
wanted to give it a three-month trial, but was unable to get either of the 
other two board members to second the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Martin says that Shooter's still suffers from the image it had when it was a 
bikers' hangout -- before he and the current owners took over two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police records show there have been only 10 noise complaints this year -- and 
most of them, Martin says, were unfounded. "One of the complaints was on a 
Monday when there were only two people in the bar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the bar, who requested anonymity, said: "As a rule, we don't hear 
too much noise. It's never been too bad that we've had to file a complaint, and 
the person in the house right next to the bar told us he's never had any 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
As for the coke bust, Martin says that is is something that could happen in any 
bar. "I could give you the names of a couple of yuppie bars in Boston where 
there are lines to the bathroom for coke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the bartender involved in the drug arrest was off duty at the 
time, and that he fired her immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 residents of Avon and surrounding communities have written the 
board -- almost all of them in support of Shooter's.

"This has enraged me no end," one Avon resident wrote. "Mr. Selectman, are you 
as a town official going to stand up against something so desperately needed in 
this town? . . . Staying sober is not a crime."

An alcohol detoxification center in nearby Quincy and members of an Avon liquor 
store's softball team also sent letters of support.

But Martin says he does not want to fight the decision because city officials 
have ways of making him sorry if he does. He says he already has been visited 
by town building inspectors and public health officials looking for violations.

"I just want to go back to the status quo," he said. "I've got a mortgage and a 
baby on the way. I'm not rich. I can't afford to be shut down."

COURT ASKED TO BAR JOB APPLICANT DRUG TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A state Court of Appeal, reviewing a far-reaching test of the right to privacy, 
was asked Tuesday to bar private employers from requiring job applicants to 
undergo tests for drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for three job-seekers who refused testing at a legal publishing 
firm urged the panel to reinstate a trial court injunction that had prohibited 
the practice as a violation of a 1972 amendment to the state Constitution 
establishing privacy as a specifically guaranteed right. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug testing, as we see it, has numerous vices that improperly infringe on 
privacy," said Steven L. Mayer, a San Francisco lawyer. The tests do not 
effectively deter high-risk drug and alcohol abuse and should not be given a 
"green light" in California, Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the defendant company in the case argued that the 
constitutional provision should not be applied to tests by a private employer. 
And even if it is applied, he said, the court should hold that drug testing is 
still a permissible means of combatting the increasing problem of drug and 
alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug use is one of the most serious social problems our country faces," said 
Rex S. Heinke of Los Angeles, representing Matthew Bender &amp; Co., a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Times Mirror Co., which also publishes the Los Angeles 
Times. "The outcome in this case will affect thousands and thousands of workers 
in this state and hundreds, if not thousands, of employers." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held in the first appellate court review of testing by a 
private employer in the state. Several challenges have already been mounted 
against testing by governmental agencies. During its last term, the U.S. 
Supreme Court upheld federal regulations requiring drug tests for railroad 
workers after accidents and also permitted tests of Customs Service workers in 
certain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case is to what extent, if any, the privacy provisions of the 
state Constitution apply to employment practices by private firms. Despite 
passage of the amendment about 17 years ago, that question has remained 
unresolved by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians argue that the guarantee should be broadly applied to 
protect workers in the public and private sectors. Employers reply that the 
amendment was intended only to curb governmental or "state action" and, at the 
most, should be invoked to prevent excessive collection and dissemination of 
credit data and other personal information by a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member appeals panel peppered attorneys with questions in a hearing 
Tuesday that lasted nearly 90 minutes -- an unusually long period for an 
appellate court case. The jurists acknowledged several times that they are in 
largely uncharted legal waters and gave little clue how they will rule on the 
thorny issues in the dispute. A decision is due by November. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Justice Gary E. Strankman noted that while there was no question that 
the right to privacy protected one's bedroom, the issue was "not so neat and 
clean" when it came to drug tests by a private company. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Justice Betty Barry-Deal also seemed to reflect uncertainty about the 
outcome, as did the third panelist, Appellate Justice Clinton W. White. "I came 
in here with some preconceived notions," White remarked at the conclusion of 
the hearing. "Now, they've all been changed." 
</P>
<P>
The tests at issue were launched in 1985 as part of a program for all Times 
Mirror companies. Company officials expressed concern over what they said was 
an "increasing incidence" of drug and alcohol abuse by members of its work 
force and pointed to studies indicating that drug users were far more likely to 
have accidents and far less productive than other workers. Similar testing has 
been instituted by an estimated one-third of the nation's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
Three applicants at the Matthew Bender facility in Oakland refused to take the 
tests and were denied jobs. They brought suit, challenging the practice as an 
invasion of privacy. Last year, in the first ruling of its kind, an Alameda 
County Superior Court judge issued an injunction barring the tests pending a 
trial. Later, the state Court of Appeal suspended the injunction, allowing the 
tests to resume while it reviewed the case. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's hearing, attorney Mayer argued that unlike some governmental 
agencies, the legal publishing firm could not justify the tests as necessary to 
protect public safety, national security or some other important interest. In 
the absence of such an interest, a private employer -- just like a public 
employer -- should be barred from requiring such tests as a condition of 
employment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heinke contended there was "not a shred of evidence" from ballot arguments or 
other historical data that indicated the voters, in adopting the 1972 
amendment, meant to apply privacy guarantees to curb drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
If the electorate wished to bar or restrict such testing, the way was open to 
do so through the legislative or initiative process, Heinke noted. But in the 
meantime, he said, the courts should not themselves expand the Constitution to 
prohibit testing.

HENRY (HEINIE) BROCK, 89, OF SHIPSTAD, JOHNSON ICE FOLLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry (Heinie) Brock, one of the original skaters in the former Shipstad and 
Johnson Ice Follies, has died of complications of emphysema. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
Brock, of Woodland Hills, died Sunday, according to George Shipstad, a longtime 
friend and co-owner of the ice revue. 
</P>
<P>
The Shipstad and Johnson Ice Follies, which began in 1936, was the first 
traveling ice show. Sold by the founders in 1964, the revue was later 
incorporated into what is now Disney on Ice. 
</P>
<P>
Shipstad said Brock performed as a comedic skater with the show from its 
beginning until 1946 when he left to perform in hotel ice shows throughout the 
United States and England. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, Brock operated a restaurant, El Paseo, in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Lil, three step-children and four 
step-grandchildren, a sister, a niece and a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
The family has requested that contributions be made to the Emphysema 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday at Church of the Hills, Forest Lawn, 
Hollywood Hills.

<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Kaye-Martin, Los Angeles actor, director and acting teacher of the 
legitimate stage, has died in Chicago of non-Hodgins lymphoma. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
The stagecraft veteran died Aug. 13, according to an announcement from Wisdom 
Bridge Theatre in Chicago, where Kaye-Martin had recently directed "Traveler in 
the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 20, 1938, in New York City, Kaye-Martin performed, directed and 
taught across the country. His students included Joyce DeWitt, Beth Henley, 
Marilu Henner, Holly Hunter and Aidan Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye-Martin was head of UCLA's acting program from 1968 to 1974 and later 
taught professional classes at the Melrose Theater in Los Angeles and the 
Wisdom Bridge and Center theaters in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving UCLA, he served as artist-in-residence at the University of 
Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, Carnegie-Mellon University, Princeton University 
and Florida State University, and was a guest instructor at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
Among plays that Kaye-Martin directed in recent years were "Ready When You Are, 
C.B." at the Night Flight Theatre in Burbank, "The Man in 605" at the Cast 
Theatre in Los Angeles, "All the Way Home" and "Summertree" at UCLA, and "On 
Tidy Endings" at Los Angeles' Ensemblefest '88. 
</P>
<P>
His acting credits include "Murder Among Friends" at Theatre-at-the-Square, 
Boston; "A Sandburg Odyssey," Lincoln Center Library, New York City; "Cyrano de 
Bergerac," Cocoanut Grove Playhouse, Miami; "Paint Your Wagon," Equity Library 
Theater, New York City, and "Happy Birthday Wanda June," Chamber Theater, Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a brother, Allen. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles memorial service is being planned for Sept. 24. A Chicago 
memorial service will be conducted at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 25 at the Wisdom Bridge 
Theatre. A memorial fund also will be established in Kaye-Martin's name at that 
not-for-profit theater.

INITIATIVE PLANNED AGAINST FLUOROCARBONS

After two separate bills were stalled until next year, Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) said Tuesday he will sponsor a voter initiative for 1990 that 
would stringently regulate atmosphere-damaging chemicals in air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill, which would have prohibited the sale of chlorofluorocarbons in 
small cans and require it to be recycled under strict guidelines, was held over 
by the Senate Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"(The committee) has got to be crazy to do this," Hayden said. "This is 
guaranteed to become an initiative. But their action didn't surprise me at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
He said polls he had commissioned indicate that as many as 75% of California 
voters would support an initiative that would more closely regulate use of 
chlorofluorocarbons -- even if it affected use of air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Chlorofluorocarbons have been targeted by scientists as a major villain in the 
increasing depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer. Ozone filters out 
harmful ultraviolet sunlight that can cause skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an even broader bill carried by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos that 
would ban the sale of automobiles with air-conditioning units using the 
chemical after 1992, was held over in the Assembly Environmental Safety and 
Toxic Materials Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) urged the environmental safety committee to 
hold a forum on banning use of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's call for a summit meeting . . . with all the appropriate leaders and 
parties. Let's make it clear that this is a serious issue," said Vasconcellos. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos received verbal support for his bill -- but the Assembly members 
said they wanted to study the issue further. With the lawmakers adjourning on 
Sept. 15, that means the issue is dead at least until next year.

A New Jersey company is recalling 47,000 "Hush Puppies" sweat suits for 
children because a noisemaking device behind the plastic dog decal on the suit 
can come loose and present a choking hazard, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the suits were supplied by The Haddad Group Ltd. of 
Bayonne, N.J., and were sold at Montgomery Ward stores from August until 
mid-December, 1988. No injuries have been reported.

INVESTOR CHANGES MIND, SAYS NAME WAS NOT FORGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles real estate investor who told The Times that his signature had 
been forged on two deeds notarized by Ben Karmelich, president of Highland 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., has changed his mind and signed an affidavit 
saying the signatures were genuine after all. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon checking my records, there was absolutely no fraud or forgery," Syed 
Mouzzam Ali said in the sworn statement. "I signed the two deeds." 
</P>
<P>
Ali's affidavit, coupled with the recollections of a title officer who said she 
was present at the signing, indicate that Karmelich did not notarize two 
alleged forgeries, as The Times reported July 31. Karmelich has repeatedly 
denied ever notarizing forged signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Ali's initial allegations, the California secretary of state's office 
announced Aug. 3 that it had opened an investigation into the matter. In an 
interview Tuesday, James W. Randall, chief of the notary division, said he will 
drop that part of the investigation dealing with the notarization of a forgery. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said investigators will still ask to examine Karmelich's notary 
journal because "on the face, it appears he may have violated the (state) law" 
that prohibits notaries public from notarizing any transaction in which they 
have a "direct financial or beneficial interest." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we were concerned about most, of course, was the forgery," Randall 
said. "But at this point, this case is still open. . . . Where's there's one 
violation, sometimes there are more." 
</P>
<P>
The two deeds Ali now says he signed were part of a single transaction in which 
he sold two downtown residential hotels to a company controlled by Joe 
Fitzpatrick, a regular Highland customer and stockholder who was later 
convicted of 24 slum code violations on three properties, including one of the 
two hotels he bought from Ali in this transaction. Fitzpatrick declared 
bankruptcy in 1986, and left the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
In that transaction, Karmelich and his wife appeared as beneficiaries on a 
$550,000 note recorded simultaneously with the two deeds. The Times article 
quoted a state banking official who said Karmelich's personal involvement 
raised questions as to whether Karmelich may have violated federal 
conflict-of-interest regulations. Public records show that the note was paid 
off a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violations Denied 
</P>
<P>
Karmelich declined to discuss his financial involvement in the property except 
to deny any violation of law or ethics. "Mr. Karmelich feels strongly that the 
only thing he's guilty of is being an active businessman," his attorney, 
Michael Berk, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
When initially asked about his signature in June in a 30-minute tape-recorded 
interview with two Times reporters, Ali was adamant that he had not signed the 
documents. He repeatedly described the signature on the two documents as 
"forged." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the signature on both deeds was spelled out letter by 
letter. His own signature, he stressed, is an unusual combination of Arabic and 
English script. To prove his point, he emptied his wallet to show 
identification cards with his true signature, and demonstrated his signature 
for reporters. A longtime business associate of Ali's confirmed he had never 
seen Ali sign a signature such as the one on the deed. 
</P>
<P>
When it was pointed out to Ali in that interview that Karmelich had notarized 
the signature, he said: "I'm sorry, this is not mine. . . . (someone) forged 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked now why he had changed his mind, he said he had remembered that a title 
officer involved in the transaction had requested him not to use his normal 
signature, but to print his name instead. 
</P>
<P>
"That must have been the only time I ever signed my name that way," he said. "I 
signed those documents, but that is not my signature." 
</P>
<P>
In his affidavit, Ali says he met Karmelich, Fitzpatrick, and a title officer 
at what was then called the American Title Co. in Glendale at 6:30 a.m. on May 
27, 1983. They met at that early hour, he said, because there was no escrow in 
the transaction and that he and Fitzpatrick, who had had prior dealings, did 
not trust each other. All sides, he said, wanted the sale to get "priority" 
recording at 8 a.m. at the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. He did not 
explain why there was no escrow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing Is Important 
</P>
<P>
Title companies, which insure clear title to new buyers, generally insist on 8 
a.m. "priority" recording to make certain no additional liens are recorded 
against a property between the time documents are signed and the time they are 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Ali said the parties involved waited at the title office until the documents 
had been recorded. He said he then received a cashier's check for $550,000 for 
the two properties, and went with Fitzpatrick to the bank to cash it. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ali did not recall the name of the title officer, The Times reached 
Linda Blood, then branch manager of the company, who said in an interview that 
she was present at the meeting and recalled it in detail because it was the 
only such early morning transaction she had ever been involved in. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all legitimate, but I had gotten legal advice beforehand because. . . . 
I had to determine it was a kosher thing to do," she said. "They wanted to do 
it without an escrow . . . so money could pass hands upon confirmation and 
nobody could cheat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
She said Ali signed the documents, Karmelich notarized the deal, and checks 
were exchanged. She said she did not know Karmelich had any financial interest 
in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Still unclear, however, is why Ali signed his name the way he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never tell anyone to print their name," Blood said. "That just doesn't 
make sense. I also want signatures because you're signing a legal document, 
just the way a bank officer would."

TAINTED FOOD KILLS TWO AT NURSING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL and IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two elderly patients have died and dozens of others have taken ill during a 
food poisoning outbreak at a Pomona nursing home, county officials disclosed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said Denise Louetta, 89, 
and Laurencia Spurlock, 78, died from eating contaminated food served at the 
Towne Avenue Convalescent Hospital in Pomona on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials said 47 of 88 patients and seven of 89 staff members have 
taken ill with symptoms of nausea and diarrhea. Two patients and two staffers 
became sick on Monday or Tuesday of this week in an apparent recurrence of the 
earlier attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Cited 
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak, health officials have cited the 94-bed nursing home for 
deficient food preparation practices that included serving outdated mayonnaise 
as well as milk that had been sitting too long without refrigeration. The 
temperature gauge on the dishwasher was reported to be broken and food 
preparation areas were not kept clean. 
</P>
<P>
Health inspectors also cited the nursing home for failing to promptly report 
the food-poisoning outbreak. The nursing home notified the health department 
three days after the outbreak, rather than within the required 24 hours, said 
Marvin Brandon, the county health official in charge of nursing home 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Crume, administrator of the nursing home, said that he was not aware that 
food poisoning had been found to have caused the deaths of the two patients. He 
denied any problems with food handling -- either past or present. 
</P>
<P>
But health officials in the county's San Gabriel Valley office said an 
inspection of the nursing home last December had unearthed 21 deficiencies, 
including a dirty kitchen floor, cupboards and windows. The partition in a 
double sink was not sealed off, allowing dirty water to mix with clean water. 
The nursing home was ordered to correct the deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy for the county Health Services 
Department's disease control program, said the bacterium responsible for the 
illness has not been pinpointed. But she said she suspects the culprit is a 
bacterium that incubates in unrefrigerated food left long enough at a certain 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No "Shortcuts"

Of the outbreak, she said, "This can happen almost anyplace, which is why we 
keep pounding at people about food handling. When feeding 50 people, you can't 
afford to take any shortcuts." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Fannin said, food poisoning outbreaks have occurred in nursery 
schools, day camps, hospitals or during picnics "where people aren't used to 
preparing (large quantities) of food." 
</P>
<P>
The important point to stress, she added, is that the organism is most likely 
not a virulent one that ordinarily causes death, "but in a fragile (elderly) 
population it can push them over the line." 
</P>
<P>
Louetta and Spurlock died shortly after they were hospitalized Aug. 12. The 
cause of death in both cases was initially listed as a swollen colon. But after 
an autopsy, the county coroner determined that the women had died "due to 
bacterial food poisoning due to ingestion of contaminated food." 
</P>
<P>
Families of the victims could not be reached, and nursing home personnel 
discouraged a reporter from interviewing patients.

Patients Isolated 
</P>
<P>
Crume said that afflicted patients had been isolated from the others and that 
the nursing home was not accepting any new patients at this time.

From June, 1987, to June, 1988, collectors from the Los Angeles Bureau of 
Sanitation picked up 1,173,000 tons of household refuse. To study its 
composition, a representative load of about 1,000 pounds of household refuse 
from different parts of the city was picked up on a route each day, then sorted 
into 16 categories. After 52 weeks of separating 144 tons, this was the 
breakdown:

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE LEAVES BENCH IN 'RESCUE' TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Municipal Court judge banished the jury and stormed off the bench 
on Tuesday after an anti-abortion crusader persisted in asking an abortion 
clinic official on the witness stand about killing children and whether he 
believed in God. 
</P>
<P>
When Randall Terry, leader of Operation Rescue, asked Michael Monji, associate 
director of the Family Planning Associates clinic, whether he believed in God, 
Judge Richard Paez said the question was irrelevant, told the jury to disregard 
it and ordered Terry not to ask such questions. 
</P>
<P>
Terry then asked Monji if he knew of any other business "that engages in the 
killing of children" and the judge repeated his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after Terry asked Monji if he expected to be "held accountable before 
God" for his actions, Paez ordered Terry to sit down, temporarily dismissed the 
jury and left the bench. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-minute recess, Paez returned, screened Terry's questions and 
disallowed all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Terry is one of five defendants charged with trespassing and resisting arrest 
at a March 25 protest outside the clinic.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VOTE ON EXPANSION OF JAIL DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a proposal to expand the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los 
Angeles Tuesday delayed a Board of Supervisors' vote for one week, but admitted 
their chances of picking up the votes to kill the project are slim. 
</P>
<P>
The county has proposed adding 2,408 beds to the Bauchet Street jail, bringing 
the capacity to 8,000 inmates. The $328-million project is the cornerstone of 
efforts to alleviate overcrowding in the county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 residents and merchants from Chinatown, Olvera Street and the William 
Meade housing project directly behind the jail showed up at the board meeting 
to protest the plan, saying their communities are already overloaded with 
existing or proposed jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to the delay to give residents time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Soledad Castellanos, president of the William Meade housing project's residents 
council, told supervisors in Spanish, "From my apartment, it is less than 50 
yards to the wall of the jail. Every day, we see prison guards, helicopters and 
patrol cars, especially when there are escapes. It is no way to raise 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said the plans for a jail 
expansion run counter to efforts to revitalize the northeast corridor to 
downtown Los Angeles. He and others urged supervisors to "spread the burden" 
for jail facilities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
A new 2,100-bed jail is nearing completion in the Santa Clarita Valley and a 
1,000-bed jail also is planned for Lynwood.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUCKEY'S EX-LOVER ENDS TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who claims she had sex with McMartin Pre-School trial defendant Raymond 
Buckey in 1982 completed her court testimony Tuesday, and the last scheduled 
defense witness -- the father of the boy who triggered the investigation of 
child abuse -- took the stand. 
</P>
<P>
After the father's testimony the defense is expected to rest its case in the 
Los Angeles Superior Court trial now in its third year. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dusky Goles had testified Monday that she had sexual intercourse with 
Buckey at a Lake Tahoe motel after meeting him at a convention in Reno in 
November, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony corroborated previous testimony from Buckey, 31, who said that in 
his mind, adults who have sex with other adults cannot be child molesters. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin maintains that medical literature states adults 
who have sex with other adults can still be child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are on trial on one count of 
conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation for allegedly sexually assaulting 
11 of their pupils at the now-closed preschool in Manhattan Beach from 1978 
until 1983.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 10-YEAR CLEAN-AIR PLAN ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Tuesday that the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power will spend $1 billion over the next 10 years to reduce air pollution 
emissions from its 19 power plants. The mayor said the cost will increase the 
average homeowner's monthly electrical bill by 7% to 10%. DWP power plant 
emissions account for 2,329 tons, or 25% of the 9,340 tons of nitrogen oxide 
emissions from all power plants each year in the four-county South Coast Air 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The air pollution reduction program is required under rules adopted two weeks 
ago by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Bradley said the city 
supports a compromise between the AQMD and Southern California Edison that gave 
utilities until 1999 to be in full compliance with the rules on nitrogen oxide, 
one of the two principal ingredients of photochemical smog. Originally, the 
AQMD staff had recommended a 1992 deadline.

AUTOPSIES SCHEDULED ON 2 SLAYING VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Autopsies were expected to be conducted today on the bodies of entertainment 
executive Jose Menendez and his wife, who were slain Sunday night in their 
Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dambacher, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner, said the 
autopsies on Menendez, 45, and his wife, Mary Louise (Kitty) Menendez, 44, 
could provide information on how the couple were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Police Department has declined to comment on its 
investigation of the shootings. Officials will not say whether there are any 
suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Also, police will not describe the weapon with which the couple were shot 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into many aspects in this case," said police spokesman Lt. 
Robert Curtis. "Whether it's robbery or revenge or business-related, we don't 
know. There are many possible avenues." 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, chief executive officer and chairman of LIVE Entertainment Inc. of 
Van Nuys, a video and production firm, once headed RCA/Ariola records as well 
as U.S. rental car operations for Hertz Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 49% of LIVE's stock is owned by Los Angeles-based Carolco 
Pictures, which has produced actor Sylvester Stallone's Rambo films.

WITNESS TELLS COURT ABOUT '85 KILLINGS OF 2 SWEETHEARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unemotional voice, the prosecution's key witness in the 1985 shooting 
deaths of two college sweethearts in the Santa Monica Mountains described 
Tuesday how 20-year-old Brian Edward Harris spent his last few moments alive -- 
placing his hands over his eyes and pleading for his life. 
</P>
<P>
DeAndre Brown, 25, of South-Central Los Angeles said Harris' girlfriend, UCLA 
freshman Michelle Anne Boyd, was silent as she was led into a secluded spot in 
the mountains and shot in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was given immunity in exchange for his testimony against three friends 
who were involved in the Sept. 30, 1985, abduction and murder of the pair. 
Prosecutors say his testimony is crucial to the case against alleged triggerman 
Stanley Davis, 23, also of South-Central Los Angeles, who is now on trial in 
Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kidnaped Near Campus 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss, Brown said he did not 
believe that the two college students would be killed after they were kidnaped 
near the UCLA campus and driven into the mountains. The four, he said, merely 
wanted to commandeer Harris' Honda to drive to Barstow to commit a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
But that quickly changed when they arrived at a lonely spot along Mulholland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a sophomore at Cal State Northridge who was locked in the trunk, "was 
beating on the trunk, saying 'Let me out, let me out,' " Brown testified. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, according to Brown, had already walked Boyd into the field when he let 
Harris out of the car's trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy gets out and is saying, 'I have my hands over my eyes. I can't see 
you,' " Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Telling Harris that "I'm going to take you to your girl," Davis walked Harris 
into the secluded field, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Flashes of Light 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a former gang member, said he then got back into the Honda. Moments 
later, he said, he saw two flashes of light from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They were gun flashes," Brown said, adding that he did not hear any gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he (Davis) came back and just got into the car," Brown recalled. "I asked 
him, 'What did you do to them?' He said he killed somebody. I asked him why and 
he said he didn't want no witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
The four men left the scene, returning to South-Central Los Angeles after 
deciding against committing a robbery in Barstow, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' defense attorneys, who plan to cross-examine Brown on Monday, called his 
testimony lies. "From the get-go, he's been lying," attorney Louis Bernstein 
said outside of court. "He's the one who killed them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testified Earlier 
</P>
<P>
He declined to explain how Brown was lying. It was Brown's testimony that 
helped persuade a jury last year to convict Damon Redmond for his involvement 
in the killings. Redmond was sentenced to 53 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth man, Donald Bennett, was sentenced last year to 18 years to life in 
state prison for his part in the deaths. While Brown testified, the dead pair's 
mothers were in the courtroom audience, as they were during previous court 
proceedings. "This is never easy," said Mary C. Harris of Thousand Oaks.

CONTRACTOR ACCUSED OF FALSIFYING PAY RECORDS IN KICKBACK SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An unlicensed electrical contractor who serves on a county government advisory 
panel and once worked on the $1.3-billion Metro Rail Project has been charged 
with falsifying payroll records and pocketing up to half the wages of the 
employees in an elaborate kickback scheme, officials reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory C. Park, 48, president of PIE Construction Co. of Van Nuys, was 
arrested Monday and released on $10,000 bail on two felony counts, according to 
a spokesman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Park denied he had violated any laws. "I have no idea what happened," said 
Park, whose company had been awarded a $1.6-million subcontract for electrical 
work on two downtown Metro Rail stations in 1987. In May, PIE was ordered off 
the job after transit district officials learned that the firm's contracting 
license had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Park, of San Dimas, is a member of the Los Angeles County Citizens Planning 
Council, appointed to that position by Supervisor Pete Schabarum. The council 
makes recommendations to the Regional Planning Commission.

The district attorney's office, acting on information developed by the state 
labor commissioner, charged that Park falsified payroll reports to the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District -- builders of the Metro Rail project -- 
certifying that he was paying the prevailing wage of up to $27.79 an hour. The 
second allegation charges that Park illegally received part of the wages of as 
many as 15 workers over several months in a scheme that involved his use of a 
second subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
This second firm, owned by Chong U Pak, was providing workers for the PIE job 
without the knowledge or approval of the prime contractor, Guy F. Atkinson and 
Sons, or transit district officials, according to district attorney spokesman 
Sandi Gibbons. She said Pak will testify against Park. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gibbons, the workers were paid from $12 to $15 an hour in cash and 
were required to endorse PIE paychecks calculated at up to twice that hourly 
rate and then return the checks to Park. 
</P>
<P>
Park said he had hired Pak's firm to supply the workers for his job. If there 
were wage problems, he said, they were Pak's responsibility. "I didn't know 
anything was wrong until investigators came around (Monday)," Park said. He 
added, "This never happened before. . . . It's embarrassing."

Bruce Poulton, who resigned Monday as chancellor of North Carolina State, said 
the alleged basketball improprieties may also force Coach Jim Valvano to resign 
as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were made in Peter Golenbock's book "Personal Fouls," which 
claimed basketball players used drugs and that their grades were changed to 
keep them eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Poulton said Valvano offered his resignation as athletic director two months 
ago. Valvano declined comment.

COLORADO'S DRUG TESTING IS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A district court judge in Boulder, Colo., declared the University of Colorado's 
athletic drug testing unconstitutional Tuesday and ordered the school to 
discontinue the program, but a spokesman for the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. said the decision will not affect its policy of testing athletes involved 
in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their policy (at Colorado) and we have ours," said James Marchiony, 
NCAA director of communications. "Their drug-testing policy has got nothing to 
do with ours. The suit is against the University of Colorado, not the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA requires member institutions to test athletes involved in postseason 
competition. But many Division I schools have implemented testing in-season 
programs of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling by Judge Joseph Bellipanni was handed down in a lawsuit filed 
by Dave Derdeyn, a former Colorado cross-country runner who maintained the 
university's rapid-eye and random urine tests for drug use violated his 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Bill Marolt and other university officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
James Joy, executive director of the Colorado chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit for Derdeyn, agreed that the ruling 
only affected the school, but added that should the decision be upheld on 
appeal, it would become legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think every school in Colorado will see it as law, and that it can be 
enforced as law," he said. "And if I were on a coaching staff, I'd be real 
concerned about breaking that law. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA can't enforce an illegal contract and that's what they have here. 
These guys (athletes) are the healthiest and toughest people around and there's 
no reason to believe they're taking drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Drug testing began at Colorado with required and random urine tests in 1984. 
The rapid-eye exams were instituted in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Bellipanni said urine testing is an intrusion and there is 
"little doubt" that a random urine test should be considered a search under 
constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid eye exams are not as intrusive, he said, but they are incorrect 97% to 
98.5% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its disastrous ability to predict drug use, it functions more as an 
avenue to inject arbitrary judgments into an otherwise random selection of 
students for testing," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The court permanently enjoins the university from requiring any urine samples 
from student athletes for the purposes of drug testing," the judge said. "The 
university is further enjoined from requiring student athletes' participation 
in the rapid eye exam procedure." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time testing on the collegiate level has been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County ruled that Stanford's 
administration of the NCAA's mandatory postseason test was an invasion of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The case was brought to court by diver Simone Le Vant, who had refused to sign 
a consent form that would have allowed the school to conduct the test. The 
form, used since 1987, is considered a waiver of constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Judge Conrad Rushing said he would allow testing in football and 
men's basketball because those two sports had accounted for all 34 -- of 3,511 
athletes tested -- who had come up positive.

INSURANCE POLICY PLAYED A PART IN KEEPING ELWAY ON SIDELINES 
</P>

A Lloyd's of London insurance policy played a part in keeping Denver 
quarterback John Elway sidelined last week when his knee brace disappeared in 
San Francisco, Bronco owner Pat Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bowlen, the policy on Elway becomes void if the quarterback plays 
without the custom-fitted brace on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the brace disappeared from Elway's locker at Candlestick Park before 
the game, in which the 49ers defeated the Broncos, 35-17. Team officials said 
they didn't want Elway to play without the brace in case of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen said another factor in the decision to keep Elway out of the game was 
the insurance policy. "John is fortunate," he said. "Not a lot of players can 
get a policy, but he can." 
</P>
<P>
Bronco General Manager John Beake said the team took out the policy when the 
Broncos played an exhibition game in London two years ago. The clause 
specifying the use of the brace is the only such qualifying one. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jeff Townsend of Bakersfield, Calif., who designed Elway's brace, 
said a new one would be in Elway's hands by today.

OREGON GETTING SET FOR WAGERING ON NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a couple of weeks, a new football season opens in Oregon. Fans will walk up 
to counters around the state, plunk down a dollar, make a few choices and leave 
with a ticket -- their lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Before this summer, the National Football League and the state of Oregon 
probably were never mentioned in the same sentence. Then along came a new, 
controversial lottery and the result is a war of words over the ideals and 
realities of U.S. sports, a war that yet may land another professional sport in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon lottery game, approved by the state's lottery commission and 
seconded by the state's legislators in July, is called Sports Action. For as 
little as a dollar and up to $20 a card, players pick four to 14 NFL games 
against the point spread. Picking four games correctly will pay about $8 on a 
$1 card. Fourteen of 14 is expected to pay about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Lottery officials predict sales of $10 million to $30 million this 
season. And after paying off winners and administrative costs, the lottery's 
proceeds will go to the athletic departments of the state's seven universities 
and colleges. Between $4 million and $9 million is expected to benefit college 
sports in the state, with a potential $3 million apiece going to the University 
of Oregon and Oregon State this year. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL hates this. It is on record as being opposed to gambling on its games, 
even though point spreads are an unmistakable part of newspaper statistics and 
televised network football broadcasts. And the fact that the money goes to fund 
college sports makes matters even worse, according to the league. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it as a change in the traditional stance that colleges have taken in 
opposition to legalized gambling," said NFL spokesman Joe Browne. "We're all 
for full funding of athletic programs, but not for piggybacking on NFL games in 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of both the lottery and college athletic departments in Oregon 
love it. Gambling is a fact of life, they say, and their game is small change 
to the big money of Las Vegas bookmaking. They are happy to take whatever they 
can get. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrific," said Oregon Athletic Director Bill Byrne. "We have the only 
state legislature in the country that chose not to fund women's sports when 
Title IX was instituted, so we had to drop swimming and baseball to add women's 
programs in 1980. Those sports won't come back because of this, but the money 
certainly will help us. All this is, really, is a state-run office pool. I have 
no problem at all accepting the money." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL still is considering legal action, Browne said, but it must act fast: 
The season starts Sept. 10. NFL attorney James B. Noel recently met with Jim 
Davey, director of the Oregon Lottery, to find out the specifics of the 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we see where we go next," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in 1976 in Delaware, the NFL sued and lost, but 
the lottery went under during the appeals process. Projected revenues of $6 
million to $8 million fell far short; the lottery did about $700,000 in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But the Delaware lottery was different from the new Oregon lottery. Delaware 
had predetermined winnings, while Oregon is going to use a parimutuel payout 
system, meaning that winners receive a share of the prize pool. Also Delaware 
officials set their own point spreads; Oregon officials plan to use a Las Vegas 
oddsmaker. This, the folks in Oregon say, will lead to more realistic odds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they might be successful, just on a smaller scale than Las Vegas," 
said Mike Tenay, a supervisor at the race and sports book of the Gold Coast 
Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. "It's the office pool, only larger stakes. I 
like the idea." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1977 opinion in a federal court in Delaware, Judge Walter K. Stapleton 
said that betting on NFL games had been going on so long without damaging the 
league or its reputation that there was no reason to stop the Delaware lottery. 
But, Browne said, the NFL "felt very strong" about its chances on appeal when 
the lottery folded and the case was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Since then favorable decisions on trademark and licensing issues "would help 
our case, we feel, if we do go to litigation," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
But Davey said the lottery commission is aware of those concerns and has been 
careful to avoid conflicts with the NFL in its new game. 
</P>
<P>
"We use no team nicknames, no team colors, no team uniforms," Davey said. "It 
will just say Washington and Dallas, with the point spread. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
The advertising also is generic. Posters appear at the counter showing football 
players in nondescript uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a disclaimer saying the game is not sponsored or promoted by the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"If the NFL is so concerned about gambling, why don't they go into Nevada and 
clean that out? We have $1 bets. They have $1 million bets. Go after the big 
boys, then come after us," Davey said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't Oregon, but the developing trend that has the NFL all worked 
up. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia conduct lotteries, but 
none, save Delaware, ever involved professional team sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned about the two senior citizens in Oregon putting down $1 
on a gambling sheet," said Browne. "What we are concerned about is what this 
will lead to." 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials in Kentucky are talking about a similar game, and New 
Hampshire and Massachusetts are interested. "We don't want to see this 
throughout the 50 states," said Browne. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money gambled on sports in this country in a year is staggering: 
an estimated $20 billion to $40 billion. Counting non-sports betting, estimates 
range to more than $200 billion, with approximately $40 billion going through 
illegal bookmakers, Davey said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we're expanding gambling at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers the NFL is the thought that fans, betting legally, will be more 
concerned about the point spread than about their team winning or losing. As 
for Las Vegas, the sports books were doing business "when we were simply a 
cottage industry," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"The lottery commission says the state will reap the benefits that now go to 
the neighborhood bookie," he said. "Well, if people believe that, I've got a 
bridge in New York I'd like to sell them. This state-approved lottery allows no 
credit, no tax-free earnings and gives smaller odds and smaller payoffs than a 
bookie. Rather than taking business away from a bookie, lotteries like this 
will just produce a new generation of gamblers in America." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to laugh a little bit at the NFL's argument," retorted Byrne, who 
said the estimated $3 million that the Oregon athletic department will receive 
will just about cover the cost of non-revenue sports this year. 
</P>
<P>
"They raise the specter of the evils of gambling on a $1 bet. I've heard them 
mention organized crime. It's just a little bit ridiculous. I haven't heard the 
NFL complain about oddsmakers on TV. They seem to enjoy the broadcasting 
revenue. They don't complain about point spreads in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also said it's not a novel idea for money bet on state lotteries to be 
sent to state colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
"We will fund our faculty salaries from video poker," he said. "A $50 million 
science center is under construction at the University of Oregon, thanks to the 
lottery. The $100 million Portland Convention Center too. If it's perfectly all 
right for the lottery to fund these things, why not help the athletic programs 
too?"

THEY ENJOY ESPRIT DE ALBACORE;

<P>
EVEN SKEPTICS BELIEVE THAT PRIZED SPORTFISH FINALLY HAS RETURNED

For those aboard the Pacific Dawn, the tiny clump of floating kelp had a 
special significance. Beneath it could have been the source of excitement not 
seen in these parts in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper John Shull guided the sportfisher slowly past the brown paddy -- 
floating kelp is known to attract open-sea species of fish -- when suddenly, 
the sound of line screaming from two trolling rigs filled the air, followed by 
the cry, "Hookup!" 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen scrambled for their equipment and toward the bait tanks. Those 
trolling either reeled in or fought their fish. It was apparent then that all 
were starving for that long-awaited "tuna fix." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, two sizable yellowtail were brought to the surface by the trollers. They 
were gaffed and hauled onto the deck. A few fishermen looked disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought for sure they were going to be tuna," one of them muttered, hoping 
to see for himself that the prized albacore were indeed back, as reported. 
</P>
<P>
Shull, owner and skipper of the Pacific Dawn, repositioned the boat over some 
fish he had metered near the kelp paddy and soon all doubts were removed. 
</P>
<P>
A yellow iron produced a strike and minutes later a silvery-blue fish was 
gaffed and brought over the rail. A chorus of "Albie!" rang out. 
</P>
<P>
Another hookup, this time on a live anchovy. Another shining fish gaffed and 
brought flopping upon the deck. 
</P>
<P>
Albacore! 
</P>
<P>
These premium tuna, the absence of which baffled experts and severely injured 
local sportfishing, were well within range of the overnight fishing fleet. 
</P>
<P>
They hit the deck one after another during a frantic bite that lasted for 
nearly two hours in offshore Mexican waters barely 80 miles south of here. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen flung their anchovies as best they could into the wind and moved 
from one side of the stern to the other, following their drifting baits as they 
were swept by the currents. Others plucked fresh baits from the tanks and 
returned to their place in the fast-moving "A-Train." Those who were hooked up 
raced up and down the deck trying to keep up with the small but powerful tuna. 
The crew worked frantically to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
One deckhand worked the gaff and systematically plucked tuna -- including some 
sizable bluefins -- out of the water and onto the deck. The other oversaw the 
action while standing atop the bait tanks, tossing anchovies over the rail to 
keep the schooling fish near the boat and watching for fish on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"Boil on the starboard bow!" he yelled, and the nearest fishermen cast, 
bellowing, "Fresh fish!" if a fish took the bait. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper Shull, meanwhile, helped with the gaffing and gave sound advice to 
those in need of such. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Penn had wanted a thumb on that spool, he would have put one there," he 
said to one fisherman trying to stop a sizzling run with his thumb on the spool 
of a Penn reel. 
</P>
<P>
The sacks filled quickly with albacore averaging about seven pounds and a few 
bluefin tuna in the 20- to 40-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's Brad Bridges, who had already boated a yellowtail, bluefin and 
a few albacore, hooked into a dorado under the kelp but lost the colorful fish 
when it leaped out of the water and shook the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, the hookups became less frequent. The fish that still showed on 
Shull's meter had moved into deeper water and were less active. The decision to 
move was made and the trolling lines set out. 
</P>
<P>
The once-quiet galley now echoed with happy chatter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best bite in years," said Bob Curtis, 61, who has fished for 
albacore for 25 years. "I'm not in shape for this. I really should be 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
John Mantele, a 30-year veteran on the albacore circuit, said he watched the 
counts rise steadily before making his reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"I called up my partner, got his (answering) machine and just said, 'They're 
back,' and he knew what I meant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the horizon, other sportfishers, many of which had long been idle, were 
visible in every direction, searching for the longfins. Competition between 
skippers was evident as they monitored each others' successes and failures via 
radio -- all hoping to be "top boat" by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath overcast skies and amid a steady west wind, those aboard the Pacific 
Dawn encountered similar but shorter-lived bites throughout late morning and 
early afternoon, including one during which bluefin tuna in the 50-pound-plus 
range crashed the albacore party, sending a few ill-prepared fishermen into 
muscle-wrenching battles. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Mark Wallace had his entire spool of line stripped from his reel. 
Others struggled with the meaty bluefins for what seemed eternity. Greg Bayme 
of Laguna Niguel landed what later won the boat's jackpot: a bluefin tuna that 
easily weighed more than the boats's 50-pound scale could measure. 
</P>
<P>
Using 20-pound-test line, Bayme started on one side of the boat and ended up on 
the other, where he stood for more than 30 minutes as the fish sounded time and 
again before finally succumbing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was saying some guy got spooled and I though I was next," a smiling 
Bayme said after boating the tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Between bites, Shull continued to roam the choppy seas as twilight slowly 
turned to darkness. The passengers had retired to the galley, where dinner was 
being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
An hour or so had passed without incident when the alarm sounded again: line 
screaming from one of the trolling rigs and the cry, "Hookup!" Food and drink 
were left at the tables, tossed about the galley by the growing seas. 
</P>
<P>
Half of those aboard hooked up almost at once in the most chaotic bite of the 
day. The fishermen whooped and stomped their way up and down the rails, over 
and under the lines of the others. Grasping for fresh bait, they stepped 
hurriedly over the flopping tuna that quickly littered the deck to catch "just 
one more." 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, the bite Curtis called the best in years had become "the best in 
ages." 
</P>
<P>
The limited load of 18 passengers -- who paid $150 apiece -- had combined for a 
total of 85 albacore, 19 bluefin tuna, four yellowtail and Bridges' bull 
dorado. The bull dorado was caught shortly before dark, giving him a 
four-species day. One of the better counts of a 1 1/2-day trip had been radioed 
back to Fisherman's Landing and the Pacific Dawn could be labeled top boat. 
</P>
<P>
When word of the albacore showing 200 miles south of here was received early 
last month -- from a commercial bait boat passing through the area en route to 
Cabo San Lucas -- the landing operators were wild with optimism. The fish were 
very small and the size of the schools unknown, but trips were organized 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
Three- and five-day boats began to report encouraging numbers of the fish. 
Experts, who said the three-year absence of albacore is a normal occurrence, 
implied that conditions were such to allow for a northward migration. 
</P>
<P>
However, some overnight boat captains were skeptical of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Cates, owner-operator of the New Lo Anne, said: "I'm not excited. Those of 
us who have been around know better. Most of us have been through this before." 
</P>
<P>
Business was hurting, and skippers such as Cates were tired of being teased by 
the presence of small albacore well out of their reach. He and others suggested 
that these fish may have come from a resident population at Guadalupe Island 
and would soon disappear. 
</P>
<P>
But six weeks passed and feelings have changed. These albacore did move north 
and it became evident that sizable schools of albacore were within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Small albacore, maybe, but albacore nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"They taste the same and they still put up a good fight," Paul Morris, 
Fisherman's Landing manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
Bluefin tuna, bigger and more powerful and in the same area, have been getting 
some attention lately, Shull said. "But mention albacore and (fishermen) go 
nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. Last year at this time, some skippers claimed to be operating at 
as low as 20% of potential, despite the presence -- albeit scattered -- of 
bluefin and bigeye tuna. Now, the landings are operating "at or close to 100%," 
Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is a mess. Boats are coming and going at all hours. Cartloads of tuna 
are regularly being lugged up the ramps and telephones are ringing off the 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Now if only it'll last another month or so," Shull said.

<P>
MEYER, 65, RECALLS WOUNDING OF PHILLIE TEAMMATE WAITKUS BY FEMALE ADMIRER 
</P>

ALBANY, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "The Natural," the movie based on Bernard Malamud's novel, a mysterious 
woman played by Barbara Hershey shoots a ballplayer played by Robert Redford in 
a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Russ (Monk) Meyer, 65, a coach for the Albany Yankees in the Eastern League, 
was Eddie Waitkus' roommate when the Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman was 
shot by a 19-year-old woman in a Chicago hotel room in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview at Heritage Park here, where the Albany club plays, Meyer 
recounted the incident in room 904 at the Edgewater Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said that after he and Waitkus had played for the Phillies against the 
Cubs on a June day in 1949, he and his fiancee were joined by Meyer's parents, 
who were from downstate Illinois, and Waitkus for dinner at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The group returned to the Edgewater, where the Phillies were staying. Meyer's 
fiancee was spending the night with the pitcher's parents and they went to 
their room. Meyer and Waitkus went to their room, on a different floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We got in early, because (Manager) Eddie Sawyer had a curfew and we knew there 
would be a bed check," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to our room, there must have been six or seven messages for Eddie 
to call Ruth Ann in another room at the hotel. That was the name of his 
girlfriend back in Massachusetts, and although she wasn't in town, she was the 
kind of gal who was capable of flying in without telling anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said that Waitkus, instead of calling his girlfriend, told him that he 
was going directly to her room. From that point, Meyer was told the rest of the 
story by Waitkus. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie said that when he got to the room, a girl he didn't know answered the 
door," Meyer said. "He said that he had the wrong room, but the girl said that 
she was Ruth Ann's friend. She asked Eddie to come in and wait until Ruth Ann 
came back. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie sat down on a chair opposite a closet. The girl reached into the closet, 
pulled out a .22-caliber rifle and let him have it." 
</P>
<P>
The assailant's name was Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a Chicago typist who was 
infatuated with Waitkus. 
</P>
<P>
According to Waitkus, right after he was shot, Steinhagen said: "If I can't 
have you, neither will anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Steinhagen's room in Chicago was found to be papered with Waitkus' pictures and 
newspaper accounts of his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said: "Right after she shot Eddie, she called downstairs and said, 'This 
is Ruth Ann Steinhagen in room 904 and I've just shot Eddie Waitkus.' If she 
doesn't do that, Eddie bleeds to death." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Meyer got a call in his room from the Phillies' traveling 
secretary and hurried to room 904. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember them hauling Eddie out, to the ambulance," Meyer said. "The only 
thing he kept saying was, 'Why? Why? Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Waitkus, who died in 1972, attempted a comeback, but Meyer said he was never 
the ballplayer he had been before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer had a 94-73 big league record. He was 17-8 for the Phillies in 1949, was 
9-11 in their pennant-winning season the next year and played on two 
championship teams for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer has worked as a pitching coach in the New York Yankees' organization 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a special man," said Royal Clayton, a pitcher for the Albany Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not trying to move along to the majors, to make some news and promote 
himself. He's just trying to help me. He's been where we're trying to go and 
he'll advise you on anything as a pitcher or a person." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also is a loyal friend. Waitkus was a handsome man who some believe was a 
womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what anybody says," Meyer said. "Eddie didn't meet Ruth Ann 
Steinhagen until the night she shot him."

SOPHOMORE SAFETY IS LATEST ADDITION TO USC INJURY LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
With its season opener still nearly two weeks away, the USC football team is 
battling a more immediate problem -- injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors determined Tuesday that backup safety Lamont Hollinquest has a ruptured 
tendon in his left ring finger. The injury, which occurred last week, is 
expected to sideline the sophomore from four to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Out from four to six weeks is fullback Raoul Spears after arthroscopic surgery 
for torn cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the team lost starting nose guard Don Gibson for six to eight 
weeks because of torn ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
The team will practice at UC Irvine through Saturday, then return to USC to 
prepare for its Sept. 4 opener against Illinois. STEVE SPRINGER

Half-hour comedies captured the top 12 places in the A.C. Nielsen list of last 
week's most-watched programs, including a strong showing by NBC newcomer "FM," 
which was seen in about 14.7 million homes. The fact that it was positioned 
behind the summer's most popular TV program, "Cheers," certainly helped. 
Overall, the ratings released Tuesday showed that NBC finished first in the 
prime-time derby for the 61st consecutive week, and the three networks 
attracted 59% of the available viewers -- their best combined showing since 
June 19. The full list of ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the news division's report about L.A. gangs did well for NBC. Both the 
documentary on Tuesday and the follow-up discussion on Wednesday won their time 
periods with an average audience of about 11.8 million homes.

The Los Angeles Alliance for Survival on Tuesday presented United Artists 
studio officials with a "peace doll," clothed in overalls and peace signs, to 
commend the studio for its recent prohibition of horror films. UA movie 
president Richard Berger recently pulled the plug on "Child's Play II" the 
planned sequel to last fall's hit about a homicidal doll. Berger, part of the 
new management at UA, had told the film's producers that the studio no longer 
wants to make horror movies. Said Jerry Rubin, director of the Alliance for 
Survival: "We wanted to show some appreciation for the courageous stand they've 
just taken." The organization has protested films which it believes depict 
gratuitous violence and recently demonstrated outside a Westwood theater on the 
opening day of "Nightmare on Elm Street Part 5."

Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder is returning to television. Snyder, who lost his job 
with CBS sports 19 months ago after telling an interviewer blacks were better 
athletes than whites because they were bred for strength during slavery, will 
handicap pro football games this seasons for FNN's sports network. Snyder will 
appear Saturday and Sunday nights on "Who Beat the Spread," a live football 
analysis show, the cable network said Tuesday. The longtime handicapper, who 
was part of CBS' "NFL Today" on-air team for 12 years, has been away from 
television since his controversial statements, except for a show he did on the 
NCAA basketball tournament for Black Entertainment Television.

In the first of several moves planned by NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, the 
new overseer of NBC News' "Today" show, Deborah Norville and veteran NBC 
newsman John Palmer will switch jobs, with Palmer moving from anchoring news 
reports of "Today" to those of "NBC News at Sunrise," and Norville from 
"Sunrise" to Palmer's "Today" post. NBC said Tuesday that the change, in which 
Norville also will do feature reporting and regularly fill in for vacationing 
"Today" co-anchors, is effective Sept. 5.

Tigers have killed 70 people so far this year, according to official figures. 
Villagers said the toll is probably higher because many poachers hunting tigers 
haven't returned. 
</P>
<P>
Poaching has increased despite a 1982 ban on hunting the 600 remaining Bengal 
tigers and other rare animals.

PRIVATE SUPPORT FOR UCI SKYROCKETS TO $32.8-MILLION HIGH 
</P>

Private gifts and grants to UC Irvine soared to $32.8 million in 1988-89, far 
exceeding the previous year's record total and continuing a decade-long upswing 
in private support for the university. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said many times the difference between a good university and a great 
university is the private support," UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason said 
Tuesday after the donation and grant total were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Such private support, Peltason added, "helps us recruit and retain the people 
we need to make this a world-class university. . . . It's not just the stars, 
but the whole ambiance of the place." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, UCI raised $19.3 million in private donations, plus $5.4 million in 
research contracts, for a total of $24.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The $32.8-million record raised during the past school year puts UCI in at 
least fourth place in the UC system. UCLA and Berkeley lead the UC campuses in 
private support for 1988-89, with $104.8 million and $100.4 million, 
respectively, said Gay Englezos, director of development policy and 
administration for the UC system. UC San Diego raised $41.8 million in private 
support, Englezos said, adding that figures for some of the UC campuses had not 
been filed yet. 
</P>
<P>
Still, John R. Miltner, UCI's vice chancellor for university advancement, 
called the private support this past year "unprecedented . . . not only in 
reaching our $30-million mark, but also in the overwhelming magnitude of 
several gifts." 
</P>
<P>
This year, UCI received the largest gift in its history, an $8.5-million 
personal trust from Edra E. Brophy of Palm Desert to support medical research, 
teaching programs and patient care at the College of Medicine. The gift, which 
actually was first offered last summer, is being counted in this year's fiscal 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Miltner, who added that there were also more than a dozen grants in the 
$500,000 range, said the $32.8-million total puts UCI on track toward an 
informal goal of raising $200 million in a five-year fund-raising drive for the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is increased awareness of the strength and vitality of our 
faculty and academic programs," Miltner said, adding that eight years ago, 
private support at UCI was only $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $32.8 million, UCI officials say $14.4 million will go to academic 
departments for such things as endowed positions, computers and graduate 
fellowships. An additional $9.6 million will go to faculty members for research 
projects. Undergraduate instruction will receive $4.7 million, part of which is 
a $1.2-million grant from the Hughes Foundation for undergraduate teaching in 
the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, 40-50% of our giving has gone to the health sciences," Miltner 
said. "It is a very active area of giving because of the desire to cure cancer 
and fight heart disease." 
</P>
<P>
The other large donors include Donald L. Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., who 
contributed $2.5 million -- $1 million last month and the remainder last summer 
-- to launch the Bren Fellows Program, which is designed to attract, retain and 
support the superstars of the academic world. Francisco Ayala, a noted 
professor of evolutionary biology, recently was named the first director and 
fellow of the program. 
</P>
<P>
A number of private gifts went to support the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, which 
Miltner said is the world's only comprehensive database in ancient Greek texts. 
It contains about 6 million words from the time of Homer in 700 BC to AD 600. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 academic year, three new academic chairs were endowed, 
bringing the campus total to 15. The Della Martin Chair in Psychiatry was 
established with $500,000 from the Della Martin Foundation of Los Angeles. The 
Erin, Chase and Drew Warmington Chair in the Social Ecology of Peace and 
International Cooperation was established with a $300,000 pledge from the 
Robert and Lori Warmington Family Foundation of Costa Mesa. And the Danette 
(Dee Dee) Shepard Chair in Neurology, which is pending approval from the UC 
Board of Regents, was established with $500,000 from Donalda M. Pelletier of 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Other major gifts included a $1-million trust from Reed and Rita Sprinkle of 
Newport Beach for research in civil engineering; $667,070 from the Irvine 
Health Foundation to support various health-related research projects, and 
$500,000 from the Paul L. and Phyllis Wattis Foundation of San Francisco to 
support schizophrenia research. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals, including alumni, parents and community members, contributed $5.3 
million of the $32.8-million private support total. Foundations provided $8.4 
million, corporations contributed $6.9 million, and $12.2 million was generated 
from other sources, including campus-related organizations and trusts, Miltner 
said.

EMBATTLED NEWPORT HOMEOWNERS LOSE COURT ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge, rejecting claims by a group of Newport Beach homeowners 
that their homes were built on shaky ground, effectively ordered them Tuesday 
to pay five years' worth of back rent totaling about $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Eileen C. Moore refused to grant a request from 63 Newport Shores 
homeowners that would have blocked Signal Landmark Co., which owns the lots on 
which their homes are built, from collecting the past-due rent. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners, each owing between $5,000 and $10,000, had tried to avoid 
paying rent on the home-site land leased to them by Signal Landmark until their 
own legal claims against the company for alleged soil slippage and other 
deficiencies at the 31-acre site can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Those claims, part of a $20-million lawsuit by some of the more than 450 owners 
of the single-family Newport Shores homes, are scheduled for trial in November. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Moore said in her ruling in Superior Court in Santa Ana that 
she remained unconvinced that the homeowners could succeed on the merits of 
their claim or that they would face irreparable harm by having to meet unpaid 
rents dating back to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This legal stuff is all a lot of mumbo jumbo to me," said Xavier Kohan, a 
leader of the Newport Shores rent protesters, "but (the ruling) just doesn't 
seem fair to me. . . . But I guess we'll have to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
Kohan, owner of a wholesale flower business, added that while the payment of 
the back rent will be tough on him financially, "for me, the principle is 90% 
of it. I'm mad -- they've held us hostage for the last six years." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Cathy R. Schiff of Newport Beach, representing the homeowners on the 
motion in the Santa Ana courtroom, said she is not certain what avenues of 
appeal may be open to her clients. But given Moore's ruling, she said, "I think 
they're going to have to pay, rather than risk losing their homes." 
</P>
<P>
The 63 homeowners affected by Tuesday's ruling are part of a broader group of 
about 100 Newport Shores homeowners who have refused to pay rent totaling about 
$1.3 million since 1984. Some of the others who were not parties to the motion 
before the court Tuesday have already made arrangements with Signal Landmark 
regarding the back rent. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners claim that their complex, on the inland side of Coast Highway in 
the northern tip of Newport Beach, was built with a faulty settlement process 
in the 1960s, producing soil slippage. That in turn, they claim, has prevented 
windows and doors from closing properly and has caused faulty plumbing, 
structural cracking and a dip in property values. 
</P>
<P>
Kohan said it was not until the homeowners began meeting as a group about 1984 
that they discovered their common household inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Ominous' Problems 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was peculiar to me, but then we found out everyone was having 
these hassles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (the problems) are really ominous," added Ninfa O'Brien, a real 
estate broker and Newport Shores homeowner. "You don't realize it for a while, 
but then you begin noticing things -- like the beams being tilted." 
</P>
<P>
But Signal Landmark officials maintain that there are no structural 
deficiencies at the site and that they will be able to make that case at the 
coming trial. "Clearly, we certainly showed (in court Tuesday) that we had 
sufficient evidence to back up our case," said Signal Landmark Vice President 
Jim Chiboucas. 
</P>
<P>
Added attorney Kathleen Paone, representing the company in the dispute: "Right 
now, Signal just wants to collect its rents." 
</P>
<P>
Schiff, representing the homeowners, maintained that by ordering the group to 
pay their back rents now, Moore has effectively given Signal Landmark a "war 
chest" to fight the homeowners' claims at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"These people will now have to put out money for this back rent themselves, 
while they may not see any money (from their own lawsuit) for years. . .

GIRL, 9, IS SHOT WITH .44 REVOLVER BELIEVED LEFT IN HOME BY WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-year-old girl was shot in the neck Tuesday after she and her sister found a 
.44-caliber magnum revolver that was apparently left in their Tustin-area home 
by a workman, Orange County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, identified as Melissa Delfrancia, was taken to United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where she underwent emergency surgery and was reported in 
stable condition Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department Lt. William Francis said the Delfrancia home in the 18500 
block of Auburn Avenue, in an unincorporated area north of Tustin, is being 
extensively remodeled and that during the project several of the workers have 
been living in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said one of the workers apparently stored the powerful handgun under 
his bed, where Melissa's 8-year-old sister, Natalie, found it just before 3 
p.m. Tuesday. As Natalie held the gun, it discharged, striking Melissa in the 
neck, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the girl is going to be OK," Francis said Tuesday evening. "She never 
lost consciousness. She was talking all the time. There was a great deal of 
bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
Francis said the girls' parents were home at the time of the shooting, but were 
unaware that there was a gun in the house. The house is listed as the residence 
of Dana Delfrancia. A family member declined comment on the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were waiting to question the workman who owns the pistol, who was 
thought to have traveled out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to ask some questions," Francis said. "We're treating it as an 
accident."

BUDDY EBSEN BECOMES AN HONORARY CITIZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Buddy Ebsen became an honorary citizen of Anaheim and Orange County at 
Wednesday's Anaheim City Council meeting, and he jokingly declared that the 
certificate "will allow me to get parking tickets fixed in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter and Supervisor Don R. Roth, whose district includes 
Anaheim, presented Ebsen with the awards in honor of his 60 years as an actor, 
dancer and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is overwhelming," said Ebsen, who is perhaps best-known for his role as 
Jed Clampett on the television comedy "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to get any kind of award for having a lifetime of fun," Ebsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ebsen's footprints and handprints were embedded in cement 
at Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: FROM OUT OF THE WILD COMES LASSEN, A SALE-PRICED, 
POTBELLIED MUSTANG WHO'S A SWEETHEART OF THE STABLES

<P>
Debbie L. Rhodes was thinking to herself, "Well, here we are and I'm stuck with 
him," as she tethered the potbellied wild horse at the Mission Trails Stables 
in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-year-old-mustang she bought for $125 from the Bureau of Land 
Management was a good buy even though it was a beggarly looking maverick. "I 
just felt sorry for him," she remembers. "He looked so bad." 
</P>
<P>
The buy was made at a government sale at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base 
near Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
From the time she was a child, Rhodes, 33, had wanted a horse of her own, but 
she bought the mustang on a whim. "I went with a friend who wanted to adopt a 
burro and this horse just kept staring at me," she said. "What could I do?" 
</P>
<P>
She said just about everyone suggested she forget the $125 and put the horse 
out to pasture. 
</P>
<P>
"Those same people today now have offered to buy him," said Rhodes, who works 
as a printer in San Juan Capistrano. "He's really sweet, likes people a lot, is 
easy to ride and he can learn anything." 
</P>
<P>
Even though it was the first horse she owned, Rhodes wanted to break it 
herself, but smartly decided to get help from a real cowboy. "I don't think I 
really could have done it myself," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
At first, "I was afraid of the horse, but he finally let me get close and I 
found out he liked to get brushed. I would sit there for hours, talking and 
brushing him. Then he let me put a halter on him." 
</P>
<P>
When Rhodes finally saddled and mounted him, "He got scared and started bucking 
like a rodeo horse and threw me off. I think I frightened him when I slapped 
him on the butt, but that kind of settled him down and he never bucked me off 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he's my buddy." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "he follows me around, almost like a dog. The first time I put him in 
an arena he jumped the fence and came after me," she continued. "I guess he 
figured he was supposed to stay with me." 
</P>
<P>
That was three years ago, but Rhodes says despite the effort to break and train 
the mustang she would buy another. 
</P>
<P>
She named it Lassen after Lassen County in Northern California where the horse 
was taken in a roundup. "I like the name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a ranch I would probably have 10 of them," said the one-time Cerritos 
College art and graphics student who lives in Laguna Niguel. "The mustangs make 
great horses and are smart and really strong. They have great personalities." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, who sometimes goes hang gliding and rides a dirt bike, has become 
somewhat the talk of the stables because she owns the only mustang there. "I'm 
not famous," she scoffed. "I just happen to have a different kind of a horse." 
</P>
<P>
But she is like a doting parent and sometimes treats Lassen with chocolate chip 
cookies. "He would follow me forever to get them," she said, "but I think he 
loves me without them." 
</P>
<P>
Buying the horse changed her life. Said Rhodes, who is single: "I guess it's 
kind of like having a child." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Ellerman, 72, was cutting back some jasmine and an ivy plant in her 
patio garden area at Leisure World in Laguna Hills when she came across a 
bird's nest with two tiny white eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of removing the ivy and jasmine, Ellerman cut a small window into the 
birds' world. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the pleasure of keeping an eye on them while they were snug and 
sheltered by the ivy leaves, between the roses, jasmine and hanging snapdragon 
blossoms," wrote granddaughter Franciska Ellerman, 25, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn watched the doves grow and named them "Bill" and "Coo" after a 
children's story album she used to play for her two children. 
</P>
<P>
And like her children, the birds grew up and left home. 
</P>
<P>
"They flew away but I had a good time watching after them," said Evelyn, who 
notes that she has now cut back the ivy and jasmine. 
</P>

<P>
MAN FROM MEXICO DIES IN FIERY FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man from Mexico died Tuesday after the car he was driving 
swerved off Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano and slammed into an embankment, 
bursting into flames, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The man was driving a 1978 Pontiac Grand Prix south on the freeway near San 
Juan Creek Road at 4:10 a.m. when he apparently lost control of the car, 
striking a guardrail and an emergency call box before heading into the 
embankment, CHP spokesman Ken Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was severely burned, Daily said: "He just couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were trying to identify the man through the car's Mexican license 
plates, Daily said, but the vehicle recently belonged to a rental agency.

<P>
HELP SOUGHT IN FINDING MAN WHO EXPOSES SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police issued a public appeal Tuesday for help in locating a man who has been 
indecently exposing himself to women in the city since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Linda Faust said 30 to 40 cases have been reported during the last 
six years, "and I'd be surprised if that's more than a quarter of the actual 
incidents. I think he's out there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
She described the man as in his late 30s to mid-40s with sandy-blond hair that 
has been receding over the years. He wears glasses, has a mustache and, in 
recent weeks, has been wearing a beard. 
</P>
<P>
Faust said the man drives in one of two vehicles: an early 1980s copper-colored 
Datsun 280ZX or an early 1980s white, full-size Chevrolet Blazer with a brown 
stripe. He apparently removes the license plates before going out to seek 
victims, Faust said. "He's obviously thinking this out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Naked from the waist down, he drives his car up to women, who typically are 
jogging or walking along the street, jumps out of the car, exposes himself, 
then races away, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents have occurred in the city's northeast and southwest sections and 
seem to be limited to Santa Ana, Faust said. All known victims have been 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure somebody's got to know him," Faust said. "Those are distinctive 
vehicles, and he has enough going with the beard and the glasses." 
</P>
<P>
She asked anyone with information on the suspect to contact her or investigator 
Frank Stastny at the Santa Ana Police Department.

SELF-DEFENSE RULINGS CITED IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he admits he shot and killed a man on Monday, 85-year-old Ferris H. 
Scott of Santa Ana may not be charged with a crime because -- after a 
preliminary investigation -- police say they believe he fired in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
While the decision now rests with the Orange County district attorney's office, 
Scott's self-defense claim could be bolstered by two court rulings that give 
California residents broad rights to defend themselves against an attacker. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police identified the dead man as Donald Eleven Clark, a 
26-year-old vagrant who last listed a Tustin address, according to Department 
of Motor Vehicles records. 
</P>
<P>
Scott told officers that he shot Clark once in the chest with a 20-gauge 
shotgun when the man lunged at him Monday morning. Scott also told 
investigators that Clark had repeatedly broken into his trailer and that he was 
trying to remove Clark when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they are still searching for a Latino woman in her mid-30s who 
was also in the trailer and apparently witnessed the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that Scott filed at least four burglary reports between July 
and August. Prosecutors are expected to begin a review of the case by the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is even the slightest possibility that a person is in danger or that 
they have reason to believe someone is going to attack them, they have the 
right to react," said James Enright, chief deputy to Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks. 
"Many self-defense cases never get to the jury." 
</P>
<P>
Enright said that, based on one court decision dating back to the late 1800s, 
an individual who claims self-defense can stand his ground and fight back, a 
privilege not enjoyed by residents of many states. 
</P>
<P>
"In the East, there is whole line of cases that say a person has to retreat 
before he can defend himself," Enright explained. "But here in California, a 
person need not retreat and that hasn't changed for years." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys including Enright also said that a 1979 California Supreme Court 
ruling in People vs. Charles Flannel could be considered in the decision on 
whether to charge Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Although in most states an individual must prove that he had a reasonable fear 
of death or serious injury when he killed, in California he must prove only 
that he thought he was in danger, according to defense lawyer William Kopeny, a 
former head of writs and appeals for the Orange County public defender's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Flannel rule says that you have a right to react if you think you're in 
danger, even if you aren't really," Kopeny said. "In California, a jury doesn't 
get to decide whether your fear is reasonable, while in other states they can." 
</P>
<P>
Several recent cases have upheld the rights of an individual to defend himself 
when either he or his home are threatened, according to Melvin Jenson, a 
supervisor in the homicide division of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In one case last March, an Anaheim man shot a guest at a party at his home, 
Jenson said. A court found him innocent, however, because it felt that the man 
had been sufficiently threatened to justify the act. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Patrick Lavasser of Anaheim was found innocent in May after he 
shot one of several gang members who had threatened to rush his house several 
months before, Jenson said. A court found that just the presence of the gangs 
along with prior threats substantiated Lavasser's claim of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Scott claims that a group of three men including Clark had broken into his 
house on previous occasions. He says he told police the day before the shooting 
that he had a gun and planned to use it.

TOP CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
FACULTY AT CHAPMAN HEARS KOENIG'S GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing himself as "direct, . . . hard-driving . . . and brutally honest," 
Allen E. Koenig told the Chapman College faculty Tuesday that as president he 
would work to build the quality of the small, independent institution while 
raising its profile and bank balance. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, who is expected to be offered the college's top job after a meeting of 
trustees today, assessed his management style and offered goals for the college 
at his first open forum with faculty members at the campus in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, 50, would be the first Roman Catholic president of the college, founded 
in 1861 by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Les Duryea, a member of the search committee, told faculty members 
Tuesday that Koenig entered the presidential race in June, deep in the final 
stretch of an 18-month effort to replace former president G.T. (Buck) Smith. 
Smith retired in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Duryea did not tip the board's hand on the ultimate selection, but said: "We 
took longer than we wanted; we set our standards high." 
</P>
<P>
James Doti, acting president of the college for more than a year, officially 
remains a candidate. However, the public display of Koenig, who has been 
president of Emerson College in Boston since 1979, makes it appear that the job 
is his if he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said his reception at Chapman had been "excellent" and added that 
administrators and staff members seem to be "a real friendly group of people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were few challenges from faculty members Tuesday, even though 
Koenig raised such highly charged issues as reducing the percentage of tenured 
faculty from the current level of about 60%, increasing the student-teacher 
ratio from about 15 to 1 to 18 to 1 and cutting back on extensive course 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty Senate officials conducted an informal written survey after the 
meeting, seeking less guarded feedback from about 75 assembled staff members, 
who were asked whether they would support Koenig for president. Results of the 
poll were not available Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said as president he would seek to involve faculty members in a wide 
range of decisions, including picking a new academic vice president. The job is 
vacant. Koenig said candidates could come from outside or within the college. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged "to serve as a chief fund-raiser" for the institution and said he 
would like to see the college become "university-like" within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Countering concern that such an evolution might mean enrollment and physical 
expansion within the historic Old Towne neighborhood, Koenig said: "I certainly 
do not want to pick a fight with the city of Orange or preservationists or 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig also listed as his goals: 
</P>
<P>
* Defining the college's academic mission, including a statement of values. 
</P>
<P>
* Evaluating academic programs and phasing out those that do not fit within 
that mission. 
</P>
<P>
* Raising the rate of students who do not drop out or transfer from what he 
termed a "scandalous" 37% to at least 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting balanced budgets to the board. 
</P>
<P>
* Assembling a team of vice presidents to accomplish the goals. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said he reduced the percentage of tenured faculty at Emerson College 
from 60% in 1979 to 40%. He suggested that at Chapman, the percentage could be 
cut by offering attractive early retirement or financial packages and help in 
seeking jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Any reductions would be voluntary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig also spoke of the need to build the quality of students and faculty at 
Chapman while cutting broad and expensive academic course offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing all three elements into balance, he said, would be "one of the biggest 
challenges that I will face." 
</P>
<P>
In a light aside, Koenig also confided to his academic audience that he is not 
particularly disappointed that, with an enrollment of about 2,200, Chapman has 
no football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a jock," he said. "One of the things that I am most delighted about 
is that I will not have to attend football games on Saturday afternoons."

REFERENDUM IS URGED FOR ALIEN POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCILMAN FAVORS ADVISORY MEASURE ON COSTA MESA ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa city councilman has proposed that the city's controversial policy 
of withholding money from groups aiding illegal aliens be placed on the ballot 
as an advisory referendum, but other council members say that such a vote isn't 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ed Glasgow, who voted for the policy along with Mayor Peter F. Buffa 
and Councilman Orville Amburgey, said that he is concerned because of vocal 
opposition that has surfaced since the Aug. 8 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"That's contrary to what my constituents tell me," he said. "The input I get is 
that it's supported by 80% of the people. I'd like to know if my input is 
accurate or not." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 3-2 earlier this month to withhold funds from any 
organization -- except those providing medical aid -- that assists illegal 
aliens. Those opposed to the policy have said it would be a costly, 
bureaucratic burden and lead to discrimination against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Two council members who voted against the policy weren't enthusiastic about a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally like to get the public's input, but it seems like we've already 
had a tremendous amount of input on this," said Councilwoman Sandra Genis. "It 
seems like there's a whole bunch of other stuff we could put on the ballot. 
It's an interesting idea, but at the same time, I think we could have a 20-page 
ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle, who also voted against the policy, said an 
advisory referendum would be a waste of money, even though she said her calls 
have run 90% against the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're not out in the community enough to know what the community wants, I 
don't think we're doing our job," she said. "This seems like we would be 
weaseling out of making our own decision." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey said that an advisory referendum might be needed if support for the 
policy was split about 50-50, but his indications are of strong support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not even close," he said. "With that kind of support, I see no need for 
an advisory election." 
</P>
<P>
An advisory referendum would cost $15,000, said City Manager Allan L. Roeder, 
and it is too late for the issue to appear on the November ballot. Instead, the 
city would have to wait for the next general election, in June, he said. An 
option would be holding a special election at a cost of $46,000, Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are opposed to a referendum, Amburgey and Genis said they would 
be willing to discuss it at a council meeting. Hornbuckle said such a 
discussion would be a waste of time. Buffa could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Besides getting letters and phone calls from residents, council members have 
received a petition bearing signatures of 120 residents in favor of the policy. 
They were gathered by Costa Mesa resident Patricia Schuda. At a meeting earlier 
in the month, she brought a petition with 44 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some disagreement has arisen among council members on how the policy 
would apply to Share Our Selves, which provides medical and dental care and 
food and clothing for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey said that only SOS' medical and dental care should be exempt from the 
policy. But Buffa says the exemption should cover all of SOS' services. He said 
he would consider changing his stance if SOS wasn't entirely excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The city is waiting for word from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, which is reviewing the policy to see if it conflicts with 
guidelines barring discrimination on the basis of national origin.

HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE UNION'S LEADER SUPPORTS CITY COUNCIL'S CHOICE FOR CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach police officers' union Tuesday said Police Chief-designate 
Ronald E. Lowenberg will be an "excellent representative" of the 213-member 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to serve our chief 100%," said Sgt. Bill Martin, president of the 
Huntington Beach Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City Council on Monday night named Lowenberg its new top 
law enforcement officer after a national search. He was one of three finalists 
vying for the $80,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Assume Post Sept. 25 
</P>
<P>
Martin called Lowenberg, now chief of police in Cypress, a good leader and 
teacher of law enforcement. Lowenberg, 43, will assume his new post Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council took more than two hours to approve the choice of City 
Administrator Paul Cook behind closed doors, the vote was unanimous, Mayor Wes 
Bannister said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was good in the interviews, and he's committed to police work," Bannister 
said Tuesday. "And he's not eligible for retirement for eight years. We might 
actually keep him for more than two." 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg will succeed Grover (Bill) Payne, who retired Aug. 4 after two years 
as chief. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said Lowenberg, president of the county police chiefs' association, 
said he is active with state law enforcement groups and will add visibility to 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Before the selection, Martin criticized the job-selection process as too fast 
and said Cook's refusal to hear suggestions from rank-and-file members of the 
department tarnished the relationship between the union and the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin said all that is behind them for now. "I'm optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Transition Ahead 
</P>
<P>
Lowenberg, who acknowledged Monday night that he will have to make a transition 
from a smaller city to a larger one, described himself as a "high-energy 
communicator" who can quickly get to know the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the new chief faces a lot of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"What lies before him is getting the department heading toward one goal," he 
said.

SWIMMER ERICA REETZ PROVES SHE'LL GO TO ANY LENGTH IN PURSUIT OF OLYMPIC DREAM

<P>
Erica Reetz has revived a dream from her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 10, Reetz wanted to swim for the United States in the Olympics. 
It's a common dream of young swimmers, but she also had some common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Reetz competed for the Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team, a team she had joined 
when she was 6. Also swimming for FAST at the time was 4-year-old Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Reetz was a good swimmer -- good enough to eventually earn a scholarship 
to Kent State. But, by 13, she believed the Olympics were out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"There were just too many good swimmers out there," said Reetz, now 20. "I knew 
I wasn't quite good enough in my events." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Reetz has changed events. These days she concentrates on distance 
swimming, which could get her to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of long distance swimming hope the event will be included as a medal 
sport in the 1992 Games. FINA, swimming's international governing body, is 
expected to vote in 1991 on whether to add two distance events, according to 
Penny Dean, coach of the national long distance team. 
</P>
<P>
Dean said that among the events that could be added are the 25-kilometer relays 
for men and women. (The longest relays in the 1988 Olympics were the 
four-by-200-meter freestyle for men and women.) The distance relays would be in 
open water, such as an ocean, lake or river. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't very many people interested in long distance swimming in the 
past," said Dean, who also coaches women's swimming at Cal Poly Pomona. "But 
now more and more countries are getting involved. I think we have a good chance 
of getting these events approved." 
</P>
<P>
Which could work out well for Reetz, who was a member of the national team that 
broke the world record in a swim to Catalina on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have a good chance at the Olympics now," said Reetz, a graduate of 
Sunny Hills High School. "There were very few people who swam these distances, 
and most of them were over 30." 
</P>
<P>
Dean was named the national coach in October of 1988. Her experience made her a 
natural. She holds world records for swimming to Catalina and for swimming the 
English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reetz didn't know there was a national team until this month. 
</P>
<P>
The team was selected after the Long Beach 16-mile swim on Aug. 6. The top 
three men and top three women finishers made the team, which made the 26-mile 
Catalina swim on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Reetz qualified by finishing third. Along with Reetz, the national team 
included Chad Hundeby of Irvine, Jay Wilkerson of Florida, Jim McConica of 
Ventura, Martha Jahn of Chicago and Karen Burton, who is in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The six swimmers got a crash course in teamwork. They spent the week in a hotel 
in Long Beach and trained every day. 
</P>
<P>
"One day we went to Manhattan Beach, then the next to Laguna Beach," Reetz 
said. "They were trying to get us used to the different type of things that we 
would encounter on the swim. Like kelp." 
</P>
<P>
The team smashed the existing record for the Catalina swim despite being taken 
four miles off course by a navigational error. They finished in 7 hours 2 
minutes 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The record for swimming from Long Beach to Catalina was 12:22.0, which was set 
by a group of Santa Monica swimmers in 1984. The national team also beat Dean's 
individual record time of 7:15, set in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that our first goal was to get there, our second goal was to break 
the record and our third goal was to beat my time," Dean said. "I told them if 
they didn't get all three, I would make them work out the next day. Needless to 
say, they were pretty happy about making it." 
</P>
<P>
The national team members have gone their separate ways for now. Each is 
training alone because there are no funds available to set up a training site. 
</P>
<P>
Their next competition is scheduled for January in Australia. FINA plans to 
hold a trial race in conjunction with the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a better clue where we stand in January," Dean said. "If enough 
countries show an interest, FINA will probably include the sport in the 1992 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Reetz has enrolled at Cal State Fullerton for the fall semester and plans to 
swim in the masters division for FAST. However, she has focused her goals on 
long distance swimming on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really thought about the Olympics for seven years," she said. "But 
now I'm excited about 
</P>
<P>
getting a chance. I know it will be tough. There are a lot more people getting 
involved in this sport." 
</P>
<P>
But Reetz has gotten in on the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
Reetz's first experience at distance swimming was in 1983, when she was 14. 
</P>
<P>
FAST Coach Martin Craig took the team to the beach to try open water swimming. 
Erica and her twin sister, Alexa, were the only ones who enjoyed the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else hated it," Reetz said. "It's a lot different than swimming in a 
pool. You have to fight with the current and the water is a lot colder. It's a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Erica and Alexa Reetz entered the Seal Beach one-mile swim and 
finished tied for first in the women's division. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her success, Erica Reetz felt distance swimming was more of a hobby, 
something to help her stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Reetz finished third in the 500-yard freestyle at the Southern Section 4-A meet 
in 1986 and fifth in 1987. She and her sister accepted scholarships to Kent 
State. 
</P>
<P>
However, midway through the 1988 season, Reetz learned that Kent State was 
dropping its swim program. 
</P>
<P>
Kent State officials told her she would still be on scholarship if she stayed, 
but Reetz decided to return to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years of competitive swimming, she was tired of swimming and wanted to 
get away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
What changed her mind was Orange Coast College Coach Don Watson, a close friend 
of the family. Watson talked with Reetz throughout last summer and finally 
persuaded her to swim for Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Erica and Alexa since they were 5 years old," Watson said. "I've 
stayed in touch and followed their careers from a distance. I had hoped they 
would come down and swim at Orange Coast, but they were so talented they 
received an opportunity to swim at Kent State." 
</P>
<P>
However, when Kent State dropped its program, Watson made contact again. Alexa 
Reetz already had decided to remain at Kent State, but Erica was undecided. 
</P>
<P>
She was actually leaning toward enrolling at Cal State Fullerton, but Watson 
talked her out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Don got me interested in swimming again," Reetz said. "I was really burned 
out. I really didn't think I wanted to compete anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Reetz's desire to swim returned. At the community college state meet, she 
finished second in the 500-yard freestyle (5 minutes 1.5 seconds) and third in 
the 200-yard freestyle (1:55.5). 
</P>
<P>
Both were personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the season, several colleges were interested in Reetz, but she 
wasn't interested in them. 
</P>
<P>
"If Erica had expressed an interest, I could have placed her in one of a 
half-a-dozen schools," Watson said. "But she was more interested in open-water 
swimming." 
</P>
<P>
Reetz plans to spend the next three years training for the 1992 Olympics. 
Besides swimming three days a week, she plans to lift weights regularly for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Watson, she already has the natural talent. 
</P>
<P>
"In any distance under 1,500 (meters), she wouldn't stand a chance," he said. 
"But the longer the race, the better, for both Erica and Alexa. I think they 
are both in a position, physically and mentally, to take advantage of the 
longer distances. If they are approved." 
</P>
<P>
Reetz said she isn't worried about the 1991 vote. She plans to train with the 
Olympics as her goal. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is get prepared and hope," Reetz said. "It's my dream right now."

TRACHSEL'S DEVELOPMENT HELPS FULLERTON REACH AMERICAN LEGION WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Steve Trachsel needed, his coaches kept saying, was time to mature as a 
pitcher. After all, he was only 17 as a senior at Troy High School and was 
still 17 when he started at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first got here he needed to grow up," Fullerton Coach Nick Fuscardo 
said. "He was just a pup. He had a lot to learn and was still young to be on 
this level." 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel seems to be coming of age just in time. 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel and his Fullerton Angel teammates will begin play tonight in the 
American Legion World Series in Millington, Tenn. Trachsel will be the starting 
pitcher when the Angels play Gonzales, La., at 6 (PST) in the first round of 
the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to the start," he said in a phone interview from 
Millington. "It's the chance of a lifetime. It's hard to believe we're here, 
considering there are about 4,000 American Legion teams and we are in the final 
eight." 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons the Fullerton Angels are in the final eight at all is 
Trachsel, a 6-foot-3 right-hander. He was 12-1 this summer with six saves for 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"He just thrives on work," said Dan Robinson, who coached Trachsel at Troy. 
"He's kind of like the old-time pitchers. 'Just give me the ball and let's get 
this over with.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel has had some success as a pitcher the last couple of years, even as he 
was growing into the role. 
</P>
<P>
He was 7-5 as a senior at Troy in 1988. He then moved on last season to 
Fullerton College, where he was a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel has had a good running fastball and a breaking pitch working for him, 
but he had a bad attitude working against him up until recently. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, an error by a teammate or a bad call by an umpire would leave him 
angry and hard to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize I had that rap," Trachsel said. "But I've come to find out I 
had a pretty bad attitude. . . . I always figured I was just more competitive 
than the others." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Fuscardo agreed that the main reason for Trachsel's poor attitude 
was his lack of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel matured during his first season in college and has continued to 
improve this summer as he pitched for the Fullerton Angels, coached by Robinson 
and Butch Smith. American Legion baseball is for players 18 and under. 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel got two victories and two saves last weekend as Fullerton won the 
Western Regional in Union City. He pitched a six-hitter as Fullerton defeated 
Las Vegas, 4-3, in the championship game Sunday. He was voted the most valuable 
player of the regional. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he's pitching like we expected him to," Robinson said. "I've seen 
this kind of success in him since he was at Troy. He can do a lot of things out 
there as long as he's under control and has the confidence. He's always had a 
lot of talent but not much composure. Now, he has both." 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel started to grow up in his first day at a Fullerton College baseball 
practice. College baseball made an immediate impression on him. 
</P>
<P>
"The older players wouldn't let me get away with anything," he said. "Right 
away, they were on me if I tried to pop off or anything else. It helped keep me 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
Trachsel and Will Barber were the only consistent starters for Fullerton, which 
went 12-27. Trachsel was 4-8 overall in 14 starts. He pitched in 82 1/3 innings 
and had a 4.81 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I had to go to the mound and slap him around a little if 
he got out of hand," Fuscardo said, joking. "But he was learning how to pitch 
and growing up the whole time. We're excited he's coming back for another 
season." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the spring, Fuscardo and Robinson both decided it would be better 
for Trachsel to pitch in American Legion ball, where he would get more chances 
to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton College summer team had as many as 16 pitchers. They were going 
no longer than one or two innings each, and only four or five could work in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it as a slap in the face," Trachsel said. "I got a lot of 
work and my split-finger (fastball) has really improved. I like seeing how long 
I can last in a game. This was best for me. I've got a chance to do a lot of 
things this summer."

Deere &amp; Co.: The Moline, Ill., farm machinery maker said third-quarter 
profit rose 21% from the 1988 period to $98.2 million, reflecting strong sales 
across all its product lines. The 1988 results included a one-time gain of $8.7 
million from tax benefits. Sales to dealers totaled $1.7 billion, up from $1.4 
billion. Chairman Robert A. Hanson said retail sales of John Deere agricultural 
equipment were much stronger in the third quarter, continuing a pattern 
established in the first and second quarters.

MEXICO TO SELL LARGEST AIRLINE TO CONSORTIUM; 
</P>
<P>
WILL MAINTAIN MINORITY INTEREST IN MEXICANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its continuing push to privatize state enterprises, the Mexican government 
Tuesday announced a three-year plan to sell Mexicana de Aviacion, the nation's 
largest airline, to a consortium of Mexican, U.S. and British investors. 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Bank, British financier Sir James Goldsmith and investment fund 
DBL Americas are minority partners in the consortium, which initially will 
purchase 25% of Mexicana under a new corporation. The foreign investors will 
own 9.8% of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the consortium initially will invest $140 million of fresh 
capital in the airline, bringing capitalization to $550 million. The group won 
the bid over six other potential buyers. The government expects investment of 
$3 billion in the company over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Option to Buy 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Mexican government will hold on to 40% of the 
company for the first year and phase out its participation in three years. The 
consortium will have the option to buy the government's shares. 
</P>
<P>
"As the government will be a minority partner, Mexicana now becomes a private 
business like any other," said Jacques Rogozinski, chief adviser to Treasury 
Secretary Pedro Aspe. 
</P>
<P>
The government had owned 58% of Mexicana. Under the agreement, minority 
stockholders may trade in their shares of Mexicana for equal shares of the new 
as-yet-unnamed company. 
</P>
<P>
The new buyers are led by Grupo Xabre, an anonymous Mexican investment group, 
and Chase Manhattan Bank, which will invest $50 million each. DBL, in which 
Drexel Burnham Lambert is general partner, will invest $10 million; Goldsmith, 
$8.6 million; Mexican businessman Elias Sacal, $15 million, and financier 
Carlos Abedrop Davila, $4.6 million. Abedrop is owner of the FIMSA brokerage 
firm and the hotel chain Camino Real de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Rogozinski said the Mexicana consortium will set up reservations, air cargo and 
maintenance companies in addition to purchasing shares in the airline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enormous Advantage 
</P>
<P>
"This deal has an enormous advantage because it will allow Mexicana to grow. It 
is not just a deal to sell the company," Rogozinski said. Rogozinski said 
Mexicana moved 8 million passengers last year on 80,000 national and 
international flights and that 40% of all commercial air travel between Mexico 
and the United States was on Mexicana. He said the company earned $136.3 
million on revenue of $753.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rogozinski said the government limited foreign participation to 49% of the new 
investment. The deal, nonetheless, is symbolic of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's new policy to encourage foreign investment and allow foreigners into 
areas such as the airlines that previously were off limits. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the government has reversed its decades-old economic 
policies and sold hundreds of state-owned companies to reduce the state's role 
in the economy and lower government expenditures.

HAWAIIAN AIR DEAL SHOWS RISKS OF SPECULATION; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hawaiian Airlines, often a bridesmaid but never a bride, seemed to be a good 
stock for speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The majority owner was elderly and eager to sell. The airline was positioned in 
the center of the lucrative Pacific Rim, the fastest-growing market in a highly 
competitive industry. And at least three suitors had wooed the firm in the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the airline's parent firm, HAL Inc. of Honolulu, was losing money, it 
was still able to reach a deal in January to sell the company for $45 a share. 
The deal fell through, but shareholders kept betting that another suitor would 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
One did. On Sunday, directors of HAL agreed to sell the company to a group 
headed by former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth and Newport Beach 
developer J. Thomas Talbot. The price: $22 a share, or $9.625 below its closing 
price of $31.625 last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is an example of the risks of playing in takeover stocks, especially 
ones not widely traded. 
</P>
<P>
HAL's stock closed Tuesday at $23.625 in trading on the American Stock 
Exchange, down $1.625 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction appears to be a "done deal." The majority owner, John H. Magoon 
Jr., said Tuesday that he has agreed to sell a 51% stake -- a controlling block 
-- to the Ueberroth-Talbot team. 
</P>
<P>
But 1,900 shareholders own the rest of the stock. How, they may wonder, could a 
third of the company's value seemingly evaporate overnight? 
</P>
<P>
It's easy, say industry analysts, when shares are lightly traded, a single 
stockholder owns a majority interest and brokerage houses don't bother 
researching the small company. 
</P>
<P>
Even Magoon, who will remain as chairman, seemed amazed that the stock was 
selling so high, even though he had paid $35 a share to buy out the company 
president's 3% stake a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People were speculating that somebody was going to come in and buy at a higher 
price. They were gambling," said Magoon, 73. "It seemed to me the stock was 
somewhat overpriced." 
</P>
<P>
Magoon said he is satisfied with $22 a share -- especially since the company 
has lost $30.6 million in the last 2 1/2 years and its liabilities exceeded its 
assets by $8.5 million at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts critical of Magoon's management said the losses are expected to 
continue.

NEW GENERATION GOES FOR A SPIN IN OLDS ADS; 
</P>
<P>
RINGO STARR AND PETER GRAVES ARE AMONG THE STARS APPEARING IN OLDSMOBILE'S NEW 
CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former Beatle Ringo Starr, with a little help from his daughter, is in the 
driver's seat of Oldsmobile's new TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
And so is "Mission Impossible" 's white-haired star, Peter Graves; Noel Blanc, 
son of the late Mel Blanc; and even Albert Einstein's great grandson, Edward. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Oldsmobile officials said the car maker will this weekend kick off 
the second year of its "New Generation of Olds" ad campaign. The spots -- which 
place well-known celebrities in humorous situations with their not-so-famous 
children or relatives -- all feature the familiar jingle, "This is not your 
father's Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls from all kinds of celebrities who want to be in the ads," said 
Ted Jordan, general manager of the Southfield, Mich., office of Chicago-based 
Leo Burnett. The commercials are created out of both agency offices. "But the 
trick is to only use celebrities who we can closely connect with the product." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," said Don Gwaltney, creator of the campaign, "is we make cars for 
both generations." The TV show "Mission Impossible," for example, is trying to 
appeal to a second generation of viewers. And just about everyone knows Graves 
as the professorial-like figure who always outsmarts the bad guys on "Mission 
Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eludes Border Guard 
</P>
<P>
Last year, such celebrities as "Star Trek" 's William Shatner and astronaut 
Scott Carpenter had roles in Oldsmobile ads. 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney, group creative director at Leo Burnett in Chicago, said he got the 
idea nearly two years ago while sitting in his office on a Sunday afternoon. 
And as for the jingle, said Gwaltney, "I wrote that one day while driving to 
the airport." 
</P>
<P>
In the "Mission Impossible" ad, which even includes the familiar music from the 
TV show, Graves is pursued in an unfriendly foreign country while driving his 
Cutlass Supreme. And he is able to drive past a heavily guarded border by 
quietly taking off his mask -- only to reveal the face of his daughter, Amanda. 
</P>
<P>
In another spot, Ringo Starr is chased by adoring fans until his 18-year-old 
daughter, Lee, rescues him in a four-door Cutlass Supreme. "A 'fab four'-door," 
his daughter calls it, in reference to the former nickname of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, in which Ringo sings the familiar Oldsmobile jingle, was shot earlier 
this summer in Culver City. The director was Joe Pytka, the much sought after 
Los Angeles commercial director who may be best known for filming the Madonna 
spot for Pepsi that was axed earlier this year after airing only once. Viewers 
confused the ad with Madonna's provocative music video, and Pepsi executives 
decided to swallow their estimated $5-million investment in her ad. 
</P>
<P>
And while Oldsmobile executives say they have been careful to select 
celebrities who are not likely to cause the company any headaches, some things 
can't be predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, the company filmed a commercial that included an 
appearance by Mel Blanc -- the voice of such cartoon characters as Bugs Bunny 
and Daffy Duck. But less than a month later, Blanc died. Although Oldsmobile 
still plans to run the commercial later this year, executives are debating 
whether to run its last segment, where Blanc appears seated in the back seat of 
the car with several animated characters and says, "That's all folks." 
</P>
<P>
While the Blanc family has given Oldsmobile permission to run the ad, at least 
one celebrity broker said airing it might not be such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough call," said Alann Heldfond, a celebrity broker at Ingels 
Productions in Hollywood. "Certainly, they would have to test it extensively 
before they put it on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Advertising researchers say last year's Olds ad campaign was among the most 
effective in the auto industry. And sales of some Oldsmobile models improved 
considerably. But one researcher said that by keeping the same campaign theme 
for a second year, Oldsmobile may also be digging itself into a rut. 
</P>
<P>
"They can only stretch this celebrity thing for so long," said Jim Hillson, 
senior analyst at Phase One, a Los Angeles advertising research firm. "It 
sounds to me like they're running in place. The real challenge is to take the 
attention away from the celebrities and draw it toward the cars."

Postal Service Cuts Jobs: The Postal Service said it is eliminating 1,000 
managerial and administrative positions at 39 facilities nationwide in a 
consolidation move. The agency said the cuts will have no effect on mail 
service. The consolidation, which takes effect Sept. 23, is expected to save 
$30 million to $35 million a year, the Postal Service said. Jobs will be 
eliminated through early retirements and other forms of attrition, postal 
officials said. In California, three management sectional centers are to be 
eliminated in Pasadena, Redding and Marysville.

Warner in Licensing Deal: Warner Bros., its profit already soaring from fees 
for "Batman" merchandise, is teaming up with pro baseball in a licensing deal 
for Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester the Cat and other "Looney Tunes" 
characters. LCA Entertainment, Warners' licensing unit, announced that it has 
entered the cross-licensing deal pairing the characters with the 26 major 
league teams' trademarks. Looney Tunes baseball garb is expected to be in 
stores by the first of the year, with toys, statues and novelty gifts soon 
after that. Generally, the joint venture is to receive a royalty of between 9% 
and 12% on licensed merchandise, with the 26 teams dividing baseball's share 
equally. LCA has been flying high this summer with fees from "Batman" 
merchandise.

COMPLETION OF PRIME BUYOUT EXPECTED SOON

J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. officials announced Tuesday that they expected to 
complete within 10 days a $1-billion-plus takeover of Prime Computer Inc., 
which has been battling Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic Four's hostile buyout 
offer and losing money for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney partner Russell E. Planitzer said James F. McDonald would be named 
Prime's new president after the tender offer for 79% of Prime's shares is 
completed at the annual board meeting Thursday. A new board will be installed 
when the deal is complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, a Natick, Mass.-based minicomputer maker, had been searching for an ally 
against a $1.13-billion hostile bid from MAI Basic Four when Whitney, the 
nation's oldest venture capital firm, came forward in June. 
</P>
<P>
The companies agreed to a friendly merger under which Prime will effectively 
become a private company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repaying Debt Pivotal 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, the next president, has most recently been president of Gould Inc., 
which he guided to a turnaround and subsequent sale to Nippon Mining Co. in 
1988. He succeeds Anthony L. Craig, who has held the post since November and 
has chosen to resign after the Whitney group completes its tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
Although Prime's stock will no longer be publicly traded, it has issued debt to 
the general public and thus will be required to release certain financial 
information publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Repaying debt will be pivotal for Prime in the coming months, said John W. 
Adams, who follows Prime for the Boston investment firm of Adams Harkness &amp; 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is whether all that debt on the balance sheet is going to make 
a difference to customers," he said. "Prime had a very strong balance sheet 
going into this and goes out with a very leveraged balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the company's two immediate priorities would be employees and 
customers. He said both groups had been severely shaken by the long struggle 
against MAI Basic. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a customer in the last 10 months, (the company's situation) would 
have bothered me to death," he said. "I think the change is a very welcome 
one." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the computer company would remain in Natick, but that a new 
business strategy would include an undetermined number of layoffs and 
"substantial changes" in the company's senior management.

CARL'S JR. TO TEST TUITION HELP FOR EMPLOYEES; 
</P>
<P>
EFFORT TO RETAIN WORKERS, REDUCE RETRAINING COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a push to persuade cooks, cleaners and cashiers to stay with the company, 
Carl Karcher Enterprises said Tuesday that it will inaugurate a test program at 
nine Carl's Jr. restaurants to help employees pay for college educations for 
themselves or family members. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's, like other fast-food chains, is plagued by high employee turnover and 
suffers from the resulting training costs. Officials of the Anaheim-based 
company view the program as an employee benefit that might help it retain more 
of its lower-paid hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
To employees and managers alike, the tuition assistance program is a much 
needed boost that will help some stay in school and allow others to consider 
college for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real good thing," said Robert Wartenburg, 20, a shift supervisor at 
Carl's State College Boulevard restaurant in Anaheim. "I go to UC Irvine, where 
they just raised tuition. They won't pay all the tuition, but it's still $350 
I've saved (per term)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farm Boy 
</P>
<P>
If the pilot program is successful, the firm may make the tuition, textbook and 
mileage payments available to workers at all 500 of its restaurants next year, 
said John Kubas, vice president for human resources. 
</P>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher, the 72-year-old founder of the chain, made it to, but not 
through, the eighth grade, said Karcher spokeswoman Patty Parks. "He was an 
Ohio farm boy who left school to help his family on the farm. But he's a big 
supporter of education." 
</P>
<P>
The program -- one of the most far reaching in the fast-food industry -- is 
open to all employees who work at least 10 hours a week and can be transferred 
to immediate family members so that a parent or grandparent who works for a 
Carl's Jr. could, for example, pass the benefit on to a child or grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
The hours employees work weekly determine the amount of benefits provided. 
Employees working 10 to 15 hours can receive up to $125 per semester or 
quarter, those with 16 to 25 hours receive up to $225 and those with 26 hours 
or more receive up to $350. In addition, Carl's will pay each eligible employee 
a book allowance of $30 per term and a travel allowance of $25 per term. 
</P>
<P>
For Wartenburg, a physics major entering his junior year in September, the help 
couldn't have come at a better time. The UCI student had saved enough to make 
it through four years of college -- if tuition had stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turnover Expenses 
</P>
<P>
College costs "would have put a real crimp in my savings," Wartenburg said, but 
the assistance will keep him from draining assets early. "It's all money I can 
put forward for a house down payment later, for when I get out of college." 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is not expected to put much strain on Karcher Enterprises' 
budget while it is being tested this year, it could rapidly become a 
multimillion-dollar annual expense if extended throughout the chain. 
</P>
<P>
But Karcher wants to cut employee turnover expenses, a spokeswoman for the 
corporation said, "and if we can get a better retention rate with this program, 
then that will pay off for the company in the long run. It will make the 
program well worth the expense." 
</P>
<P>
Other fast-food chains offer tuition programs. Some, such as McDonald's and 
Taco Bell, offer tuition aid for management employees only. Others, including 
Burger King, help all employees through college. 
</P>
<P>
But the Karcher program differs by prepaying all or a portion of the eligible 
employee's tuition. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that some of our people want to go to college but don't because 
they can't save up the tuition," spokeswoman Parks said. "This way, they don't 
have to have the money saved."

FORMER HUGHES EMPLOYEE FILES DISCRIMINATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four current and former Hughes Aircraft employees alleged Tuesday that the Los 
Angeles-based aerospace firm has discriminated against minority employees with 
the support of the Electronic and Space Technicians Local 1553, which 
represents Hughes workers. 
</P>
<P>
The major allegations were brought by Erick Hicks, a former technician at the 
firm who was laid off in August, 1987. This March, the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission found that Hicks had been "subjected to unwelcome 
harassment, which was overtly racist, severe and pervasive, which created an 
abusive working environment and was known to management." 
</P>
<P>
The EEOC determination, which was made by Los Angeles District Director Judith 
A. Keeler, found that Hicks faced "racial harassment and a hostile working 
environment because of his race, black." 
</P>
<P>
Keeler found that Hicks had been laid off just after he was promoted to a new 
job classification in which he was the most junior union member, effectively 
reducing his seniority and making him vulnerable to a layoff. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, Hicks said he has filed a $5-million federal 
lawsuit against Hughes, stemming from the EEOC findings. He said he has been 
unemployed since his termination at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaint Filed 
</P>
<P>
A Hughes Aircraft spokesman declined to comment on the allegations, citing a 
policy against comment on matters under litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Cochran, a former senior union steward at Hughes, said that after he had 
supported a number of black employees in grievances involving charges of racial 
discrimination he was stripped of his elected union office last January and 
then laid off by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran, who is white, said he has filed a complaint with the National Labor 
Relations Board, alleging collusion between Hughes and the union. Cochran said 
he was removed from his elected office by the union president, C. J. Jackson, 
only three days before the company announced a layoff in his labor 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Cleaver and Greg Meyer, both former senior union stewards at Hughes, 
said they supported Cochran's allegations. Meyer, a white, said he was 
dismissed by Hughes in May, but Cleaver, a black, continues to work at the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The Electronics and Space Technicians local is an arm of the Los Angeles County 
District Council of Carpenters. An official of the council said Cochran and 
Meyer are dissident union members who lost their bids for elected positions in 
the union earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked that he not be further identified, said Cochran's 
allegations of collusion had been fully investigated by James K. Bernsen, a 
Carpenter's official and former Hughes union president. Bernsen presented a 
report to the union's membership early this year, saying that he had found no 
evidence of collusion.

EXISTING HOME SALES NEARLY FLAT IN JULY; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURES DOWN 14.8% FROM LAST JULY AS REAL ESTATE MARKET SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sales of used houses in California were nearly flat in July, lagging far behind 
last year's torrid sales pace, the California Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, home sales increased 0.9% in July compared to June but were down 
14.8% compared to July, 1988, the trade association said. 
</P>
<P>
High home prices have slowed sales in many areas of the state, the group said. 
The median price of a house was $202,650 in July, up 16.2% from $174,388 in 
July, 1988. But price increases are slowing, too: from June's statewide median 
of $200,445, the price rose 1.1% in July. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association credited slightly lower mortgage rates -- which began 
dropping in May -- for July's slight uptick in home sales. Those lower rates 
began showing up in mortgages that were closed in July, when the national 
average rate fell for the first time in nine months. It was 10.59% in June and 
10.39% in July, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
With the slowdown in home sales in recent months, the inventory of unsold 
houses has gradually increased. As of July, it would take 7.1 months to sell 
them all at the present sales rate. That was up from 5.8 months in May and 4.1 
months in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Most Expensive 
</P>
<P>
After a strong first quarter, sales began slowing in the April-to-June period. 
The trade association expects sales in the second half of the year to continue 
slowing, said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president for research and economics. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a very hot market," she said. "This year it's been slowing for 
the last three months, and it will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Prices remain sky-high in many of the state's urban areas, making them among 
the most expensive housing markets in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco area was the most expensive market in the state at $269,982 
in July, up 26.2% from last year's $214,016 and 0.4% from June's $268,903. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the state's second-most expensive market, the median price 
was $255,897. That was an increase of 19.5% from $214,227 a year ago and 1.7% 
from $251,674 in June. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's median price was $252,451, up 22.9% from last year's $205,494 and 
1.5% from $248,728 in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles area was fourth: The median price was $224,456, up 20.6% from 
$186,133 a year ago and 1% from June's $220,253. 
</P>

Sales in all four markets were down compared to the previous month and to July

Dana Niguel Bank, a small financial institution in Dana Point, has acquired the 
Laguna Hills office of Community Bank of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price has yet to be determined because of conditions that take 
effect after federal regulators approve the transaction. But the price will 
probably be under $200,000, said Charles W. Goodson, Dana Niguel Bank's senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The branch acquisition -- the first in the bank's seven-year existence -- will 
boost the size of Dana Niguel Bank to $62 million in assets. At the end of 
June, it had $52 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The bank hopes to provide Small Business Administration loans to companies in 
the expanding Irvine Spectrum commercial and industrial center near Laguna 
Hills, Goodson said. The bank also hopes to build up its deposit base from the 
residential community as well as business, he said.

AFTER THREE YEARS, THE STATE LIFTS ITS RESTRICTIONS ON MONARCH BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monarch Bank is out from under regulatory restrictions for the first time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of State Banking recently lifted its order requiring 
the bank to raise more capital and to correct lending and management problems. 
In March, federal regulators lifted a similar order. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the restrictions is "a significant step in our recovery," said E. 
Lynn Caswell, the bank's chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
A stock offering last year raised $1.7 million in new capital for the bank, 
enough to bring it above federal requirements. It also has been profitable 
every month for more than a year, Caswell said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank posted $3.2 million in losses for 1986 and 1987. Last year, it 
produced a modest $26,000 profit, and it earned $46,000 in the first six months 
of this year. Meantime, assets shrunk from $88.1 million at the end of 1984 to 
$52.1 million at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also has whittled down its bad loans. It has only $50,000 in 
delinquent loans out of $40 million, compared to a high of $2 million in bad 
loans out of about $44 million two years ago.

STEEP PRICES HOLD DOWN JULY HOME SALES IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County bucked the statewide trend as sales of existing homes in the 
county dropped in July. Despite the sales slowdown, prices continued to march 
upward in the county and statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Existing-home sales in Orange County fell an estimated 12.8% from June, the 
California Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. Sales in July were down 27.5% for 
the month from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, housing activity was stronger with existing home sales increasing 
0.9% in July, the trade association said. The reason: Mortgage rates have been 
dropping slightly since May. Still, sales in California last month were down 
14.8% compared to July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association said the sales decline in Orange County was linked to 
high prices. Orange County is one of the nation's most expensive markets for 
single-family houses, with a median price of $255,897 in July, up 1.7% from 
June's $251,674. 
</P>
<P>
The prices in the county are up 19.5% -- more than $40,000 -- from a year ago, 
when the median price was $214,227. The median is the point at which half the 
homes sold were priced above that level and half below. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is home prices in desirable, hot areas of the state like Orange 
County," said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president for research and economics 
at the trade association. "Those areas were seeing 20% to 30% appreciation in 
prices from year to year. You need a fairly significant drop in mortgage rates 
to offset that." 
</P>
<P>
The trade association credited slightly lower mortgage rates, which began 
dropping in May, for July's slight uptick statewide in home sales. Those lower 
rates began showing up in mortgages closed in July, when the effective rate 
fell for the first time in nine months. It was 10.59% in June and 10.39% in 
July, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
With the slowdown in home sales in recent months, the inventory of unsold 
houses on the market statewide has gradually increased. As of July, it would 
take 7.1 months to sell them all at the present sales rate. That was up from 
5.8 months in May and 4.1 months in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After a strong first quarter, home sales began slowing in the April to June 
period. The trade association expects sales in the second half of the year to 
continue slowing, said Appleton-Young. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive market in the state is San Francisco, where the median price 
was $269,982 in July, up 26.2% from last year's $214,016. The statewide median 
sales price was $202,650 in July, up 16.2% from $174,388 in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After San Francisco and Orange County, the state's most expensive markets for 
houses were the Ventura County region, where the median price was $252,451, up 
22.9% from last year's $205,494. The Los Angeles area was fourth: The median 
price was $224,456, up 20.6% $186,133 a year ago.

FRAT, SORORITY LIFE: A BARGAIN OR A BURDEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE M. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've mortgaged your house, taken on extra work for the extra pay and even 
borrowed from the bank to send your budding genius off to a good college. Now 
your offspring suddenly has announced that he or she plans to join a fraternity 
or sorority. 
</P>
<P>
OK, you've heard the rumors -- from tame social teas to wild parties, from the 
unmerciful search for status to the possibility of making valuable contacts. 
But beyond the pins, pomp and paraphernalia, as parents, you're bound to ask: 
What's this going to cost? 
</P>
<P>
That question can be especially pointed and disconcerting to families already 
facing tuition expenses, like UCLA's $540-a-quarter fee, USC's 
$6,600-a-semester charges or the costs at state universities in Fullerton and 
Los Angeles running at $440- and $276-a-term respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But discounting the dollars spent on the array of obligatory social functions, 
campus Greeks insist that fraternity and sorority housing can be the best 
financial benefit of belonging to their organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only paying $330 for the entire summer," Tom Bratkovich, a UCLA junior, 
raved about his three month stay in the house owned by his fraternity, Phi 
Kappa Psi. "I only wish I lived here year round!" 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone. Almost all fraternities and sororities with housing on or near 
the USC and UCLA campuses report long waiting lists for the school year. Most 
fraternities and sororities, however, dole out housing under a "first come, 
first served" tradition, giving preference to students with the most seniority 
in their organizations, explained USC Interfraternity Council President David 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Year Wait 
</P>
<P>
This means that recent initiates -- students like Bratkovich, who only became a 
Phi Kappa Psi last fall -- may face at least a two-year wait before they can 
enjoy the cost-benefits of Greek house living. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, prices quoted for fraternity or sorority living can seem 
reasonable; it can be $50-to-$100-a-month cheaper than dormitory living and 
$100-to-$200-a-month cheaper than off-campus apartment life. 
</P>
<P>
It still isn't cheap. And there's another catch: even if students don't live in 
the house but join a fraternity or sorority, they still must pay its monthly 
activity fees or dues. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA fraternity and sorority "live-outs," for example, pay $125-to-$225-a-month 
in membership dues, various houses report. The same is true, though the costs 
are lower, in Greek houses at state universities, where fees range from $25- to 
$85-a-month. That fee underwrites dances, panels, retreats and programs that 
houses sponsor alone or collectively, said Lake, who heads the USC fraternal 
system's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Why do live-outs seem to bear the burden of those living in the frat house? 
</P>
<P>
As Lake explained it: "Essentially, the live-ins are paying the same price for 
their activity fee as those who live out . . . its just included in their rent. 
What it means is that their actual rent is what's left over from the activity 
fee. That's a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Bratkovich also defended the system, saying it's fair because, "everyone goes 
through it. You get in line, you wait until a space is available, and then you 
move in. It's kind of like a reward . . . you look forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
For those students lucky enough to get space in a house, there are rewards to 
Greek life. At UCLA, for example, frat house residents pay $350- to 
$400-a-month, while other students pay up to $520-a-month for on-campus 
housing, university housing officials say. While some dorms provide 19 meals a 
week, full access to recreation facilities and utilities, the fee for Greek 
living covers meals -- at some houses -- utilities and monthly dues (activity 
fee). 
</P>
<P>
In Westwood and neighboring areas, off-campus housing can be especially steep, 
running from $425- to $900-a-month for bachelor or single apartments, the 
off-campus housing office said. At USC, campus dorm fees include meals and 
range from $550- to $625-a-month; off-campus apartments with kitchens cost 
about $300 monthly, the USC housing office says. 
</P>
<P>
In Alhambra, at Cal State Los Angeles the off campus housing ranges anywhere 
from $200- to $250-a-month, in comparison to the $100- to $200-a-month required 
in a frat or sorority. The $85- to $200-a-month that Greeks pay to live-in at 
Cal State Fullerton fraternity or sorority houses may seem cheap, but does not 
include meal- or activity-fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easing the Burden 
</P>
<P>
Many students in fraternities or sororities try to ease the financial burden on 
themselves and their parents by taking on parttime jobs. While Lake's parents 
help with his tuition at USC, he, for example, works to pay for his 
extracurricular activities and living expenses. Bratkovich maintains a 
scholarship that covers two-thirds of his UCLA tuition. Other students borrow 
on student loans -- to supplement their tuition, not their fraternity or 
sorority activities. 
</P>
<P>
Activity fees, fraternities and sororities emphasize, also are not the only 
costs incurred by members. As part of their socializing, they can end up 
spending money on clothes, gifts and other items. 
</P>
<P>
But Cynthia Ralphs, of Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority at USC, said that sum 
"depends on the woman and what she wants to spend her money on. There are so 
many things you can't spend money on related to Greek activities, like spending 
money for clothing with paraphernalia, gifts for your big or little sister, or 
semiformal dresses for socials, even things like your sorority pin . . . that 
can range anywhere from $40 to $600 depending on how many diamonds or pearls 
are on it . . .." 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Northridge, where fraternity and sorority houses are restricted by 
zoning ordinances, students like Interfraternity Council President Tom Breneman 
say they "miss a part of Greek life" they would like to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
But fraternity and sorority members on the Northridge campus still enjoy a 
sense of belonging that outweighs the financial sacrifices their activity may 
require. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a home environment," said Kappa Alpha Theta member Cynthia Ralphs. "You 
have your sisters around, a house mother . . . if you're sick or homesick or 
something, they are there to comfort you. We are like a family unit, and all of 
our social activities usually take place at the house. The house becomes a 
living entity."

MORE STRESSES OVER TRESSES FOR PARENTS, KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the generations are at odds over hair. In the '20s, young women got 
in trouble for bobbing their hair. In the '60s, young men defied the 
Establishment with long hair and unruly sideburns. Today, it's the young 
generation -- the really young generation, the 4-to 14-year-old set -- who are 
arguing with parents about hair styles. 
</P>
<P>
But this time it's the parents who want something bold, a style that makes a 
statement -- and the kids who are opting for something subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Sabrina Pidgeon, a stylist at the Yellow Balloon in Studio City, one of Los 
Angeles' many kids-only salons, reports that a remarkable number of very young 
citizens are cautious about their looks, preferring the inconspicuous to the 
outlandish. 
</P>
<P>
"They want something pretty conservative -- a moderate buzz, a blunt bob, maybe 
with a little body wave . . . anything that will keep them from standing out 
too much," she says. Their parents, on the other hand, are after "something 
unusual -- a tail in the back (for boys) . . . a major perm (for girls)." 
</P>
<P>
Remarks Margaret Bates, a stylist and owner of Sleeping Beauty, a salon for 
men, women and children in Long Beach: "You wouldn't believe how conservative 
things are getting. I've been in this business 36 years. Believe me, I've seen 
a lot of styles come and go. But all the boys want today are crew cuts and the 
girls, bangs, little bangs. And braids. You wouldn't believe how many braids we 
did for the prom this year." 
</P>
<P>
That children under 10 are even thinking about their looks is surely 
significant. Time was when it took puberty and its accompanying surge of 
hormones to get kids interested in hair styles. No more -- at least not in Los 
Angeles. Thanks to television and video -- and a little help from their parents 
-- even the tiniest tots seem to have an opinion about how they should look. 
</P>
<P>
And, while their parents, especially the ones who grew up in the '60s, may 
contemplate something radical in the way of a cut, California's tots, as well 
as its teen-agers, want to go as Clark Kent or Lois Lane look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls want to look like Debbie Gibson (a popular teen-age singer)," 
explains Jack King, former owner of Tipperary in Beverly Hills and now owner of 
Cowlicks, a fashionable children's salon in Calabasas. "They want a bob, chin 
length, a little longer on the sides, tapered into the neck, with some light, 
wispy bangs. . . . Or they want long red hair like (singing star) Tiffany's." 
</P>
<P>
The boys, King says, want to look like Michael J. Fox, with a haircut that is 
short on top and a little long on the sides. Or they want the Tom Cruise cut. 
His is short, with some sort of dressing to make it look shiny and stay in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
King has made it his business to make kids feel like stars -- even if they 
don't always look like stars, or act like them. Cowlicks, King's newest 
establishment, is like many children's hair salons today -- only more so. A 
cross between a cluttered old-fashioned clubhouse and sleek modern-day movie 
studio, it is designed to help young ones deal with the anxiety of getting 
their first hair styles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The First Haircut 
</P>
<P>
The walls are plastered with pictures of young stars. The counters and floors 
are stocked with cookies, gum-ball machines, pinball machines, video games and 
toys of every size and description. Rock music fills the air, and overhead, a 
video camera and monitor record the once-in-a-lifetime experience of that first 
haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, a small eatery serves what King's publicist calls "gourmet fast 
food": hot dogs, peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, non-fat yogurt, 
low-cholesterol popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
At Cowlicks, and most of Los Angeles's other trendy children's hair salons, 
youngsters can get most any style they -- or their parents -- want. But it's a 
good idea to come armed with a picture -- or better yet, the name of a 
well-known star -- because the nomenclature in this business is tricky. 
</P>
<P>
For girls, the Farrah Fawcett is definitely out, but the Dorothy Hamill hangs 
on, though in a slightly more severe and stylized (if that is possible) 
fashion, known as the Step at Nadia Pidgeon's Yellow Balloon shop. (Nadia 
Pidgeon is mother of Sabrina Pidgeon and founder of the first of the Yellow 
Balloons in Westwood, which claims to be the oldest establishment in the city 
that's strictly for children.) 
</P>
<P>
While Cowlicks calls a classic boy's cut a Michael J. Fox or a Tom Cruise, the 
same thing at the Yellow Balloon is a Superman (otherwise known as Clark Kent). 
An updated version of the old crew cut goes under the name of the Brush, but 
it's also known as the Buzz. Moderate Buzzes or Radical Buzzes are available. 
There are also various layered, moderately spikey looks that go under such 
names as the Don Johnson (of "Miami Vice" fame) or the MacGyver (also of 
TV-series fame). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ghost Buster Cut 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Sabrina's famous Ghost Buster cut, which fits almost anything. 
"I haven't even seen the movies," she confesses. "I just use it to get them 
(the little ones) into the chair." 
</P>
<P>
For those who are more daring, there are spiffier cuts, including the Wave, a 
style with very short sides and back, a part and bangs cut on an angle and then 
heavily gelled to stay in place. "A bit like a baseball cap," Sabrina says. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the shaved-sides, long-top look of a medieval monk, which goes by 
the name of the Mushroom at Sleeping Beauty and the Poet at Cowlicks. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a stylist to do what kids want -- and all the things their parents 
demand -- isn't easy, says Richard Bilemjian, a stylist and owner of 
Kaleidoscope in Santa Monica. "A lot of people just don't want to bother with 
kids." They squirm, they cry. They have parents who have ideas of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Because children's salons have become so popular in recent years, making an 
appointment is a good idea, especially after school, in the evenings or on 
weekends. Early-morning appointments are advised for toddlers -- just after 
breakfast and before the nap-time crankies set in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mostly Mothers' Work 
</P>
<P>
Most salons expect children to be accompanied by someone, and it can be a nanny 
or anyone else who will pay the bill. Dads are in evidence on the weekends, but 
during the week, getting the kids to a hair stylist is still mostly mothers' 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Costs vary considerably. At Cowlicks, prices begin at about $17. At Yellow 
Balloon, a baby's first cut is $9. Older kids can expect to pay $13 to $15. 
Yellow Balloon, like many salons, used to charge more for girl's cuts than 
boy's, until Gloria Allred brought a sex-discrimination lawsuit against the 
salon in 1985 and set the matter straight. 
</P>
<P>
One word of caution: Prices for cuts don't include accouterments. And most 
children's salons are stocked with shamelessly overpriced ribbons, bows, 
necklaces, sunglasses -- whatever it takes to make a child feel like a star, 
albeit an inconspicuous one.

NEW AND USEFUL: A HANDY DEVICE TO CLEAN MINI-BLINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're tired of spending hours on the messy chore of cleaning mini-blinds, 
consider this new helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
Just introduced by IdeaWorks Inc. in Pacific Palisades, the Mini Blind Vac 
Attachment looks like a small hand with four fingers. It attaches over any 
standard size vacuum to clean dust off mini-blinds through small holes in each 
of its plastic fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The device, whose attached handle adjusts to several positions so it can slide 
along blinds, also is easy to wash when you're done cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays no one has the time to hand-clean mini-blinds," IdeaWorks president 
Fred MacMurray observed. "It takes hours to take them down and hose them off. 
This simplifies the whole process, by avoiding messy cleaners and reducing the 
time involved." 
</P>
<P>
The attachment comes with two adapters so it can fit on vacuums with odd-sized 
hoses or on Dustbusters. In stores, it retails from $7 to $12. It's available 
in Southern California at Home Club and Home Depot; in Northern California, at 
Thrifty stores. Or you can order it for $9.99 plus $1 postage from IdeaWorks 
Inc., 15237 Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades 90272; (213) 454-7621. 
</P>
<P>
Guide for Gardeners 
</P>
<P>
Home gardeners might want to check out Garden Guides, a new low-water, low 
maintenance reference booklet that tells what plants, vines, shrubs and trees 
are drought-resistant and when to plant, water, prune and fertilize them. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California guidebook was developed by Newport Beach landscape 
architect Lynn Capouya who uses low-maintenance native plant material in her 
landscaping projects. She "first saw the need for this project nine years ago 
when I noticed that many of my clients' landscapes did not hold up due to poor 
maintenance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Capouya offers 35 examples of drought-resistant plants in her guide, which 
consists of a set of 12 plastic-coated cards attached to a metal ring so they 
can be hung in the garage or tool room for easy reference. She also gives tips 
on spacing plants and trees and how to stake trees if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Guides are available in selected garden centers, gift shops and hardware 
stores. If you can't find them in a store in your area, you can order them for 
$9.98 plus $2 postage and handling (and 6% California sales tax) from Lynn 
Capouya Inc., 3822 Campus Drive, Suite 120, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660; (714) 
756-0150. LYNN SIMROSS

A LONG WALK THROUGH ART AND NATURE 
</P>

<P>
Lightly is the operative word with Richard Long. The tall, lithe British artist 
moves lightly around his work, his crisp, softly spoken words barely mixing 
with the air around him. Of the long, solitary walks that form the basis for 
his art works, Long says, "I travel lightly. I touch the world lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Shaking off theories and complex interpretations of his work as if oppressive 
weights, Long sticks to a light, lean vocabulary and common sense. Yet when he 
seizes an idea that suits him, a touch of the ethereal comes over his mellow 
green eyes. 
</P>
<P>
This subtle vacillation between the plain and the mysterious, the obvious and 
the secret, describes Long as much as his work. For the last 20 years, he has 
taken long walks in the wilderness of his native England and remote regions of 
India, Africa, Spain, Bolivia and Nepal. Often he sets his course in advance by 
drawing a straight line or a circle on a survey map, or by determining the 
number of minutes, hours or days he will walk. Along the way, he may assemble 
stones or pieces of driftwood in a circle or line, or pick up stones at regular 
intervals and place them back down a prescribed distance later. Often he will 
represent a walk through a single photograph and a few written, sensory 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
"My work has become a simple metaphor of life," he has written. "A figure 
walking down his road, making his mark." 
</P>
<P>
Long, 44, spent the last two weeks in San Diego, preparing work for his first 
West Coast museum show, which opened Sunday at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art and continues through Oct. 15. Using local mud, he 
hand-painted a circle on one gallery wall and a long, horizontal line on 
another. He sculpted circles out of delicately streaked stones from Utah and 
dark rocks from Baja California. The visual and verbal documentation of two 
previous walks completes the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I make my art out of very normal, basic human activities," he said in an 
interview at the museum. "Everyone is familiar with walking. If I make a walk, 
just by some subtle change I ritualize it a bit more than most people's 
walking. Just by ritualizing it I make it into art." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the simple, declarative presence of his work is a hint of the spiritual, 
the sacred. Ancient stone circles that were used as sites of worship and 
monitors of the celestial theater float through one's memory when viewing 
Long's work. The connection is deliberate, like all of the artist's actions, 
but never forced. 
</P>
<P>
"I just choose (the stones) out of the world and put them into a circle and 
show them to you as a circle of stones," he said. "But I'm actually tapping a 
knowledge of materials and a knowledge of images that people are deeply 
familiar with. Lines and circles are part of our culture but they're part of 
all cultures -- they're universal human symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, lines and circles are far more powerful and emotional than if I were 
making my own idiosyncratic, personal images. They also have a power because 
they're extremely open systems. I can make a circle of stones, a circle of 
muddy water, a walking circle a hundred miles wide. Even though it's like 
repeating the same idea, it's such an open image that they can be vehicles for 
endless ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Japanese Zen calligrapher who guides his brush in the form of a circle 
over and over again, investing each gesture with meditative, spiritual 
significance, Long has kept his work simple and consistent. For his first walk, 
while a student at St. Martin's School of Art in London in 1967, he used only 
his own weight and movement to impress a line across a grassy field. Wind, 
water, wood, stones and words have all joined his vocabulary since then, but 
the essence of Long's art has remained the same -- a "direct, one-to-one 
experience" with the materials of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
Though Long often alters the land during his walks, his touch, he says, is 
light and his respect profound. The landscape gradually absorbs the marks he 
makes, without damage to the site's ecology. These fleeting, temporal 
expressions live on, however, in the photographs, maps and word pieces that 
Long publishes and exhibits. However private his experiences in the wilderness 
may be, they are incomplete as art unless shared with others. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much like the idea that art can be made completely alone in nature, 
without an audience," he said. "I think if I just worked out in the landscape 
and never showed my work in galleries or in the art world, I suppose I could be 
considered an escapist. But I accept that I'm an artist and it interests me to 
share my work with other people." 
</P>
<P>
Few others participate in the making of his work. His two teenage daughters 
accompanied him on a walk once, and he has also had the company of artist 
Hamish Fulton, a student with Long at St. Martin's, whose work also stems from 
walks in the countryside. Normally, Long prefers to conduct his walks alone. 
"Making a walk in a wilderness area on one's own is a very profound way to be 
in a place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The diaristic nature of many of Long's documented works and the hushed aura of 
his stone sculptures set him apart from American earthwork artists, such as 
Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson, whose works involve massive displacements 
of earth, carried out by bulldozers and crews. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is about me and my own scale and my own sensibility, how far I can 
walk every day," Long said. "It's a different point of view, a different 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
With rare levity, Long recalled a friend's remark that American land art is 
"true capitalist art, because you have to have a lot of money to make it, to 
buy the real estate, to hire the machinery. It's about ownership and possession 
of land, whereas my work is much more about ideas." 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Long feels he has much more in common with American Conceptual 
and Minimal artists. Others have labeled his work romantic because its source 
is nature, but with characteristic pragmatism, Long considers himself a 
realist, simply using the world as the raw material of his art. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid-'60s, the language and ambition of art was due for renewal," he 
wrote in 1982. "I felt art had barely recognized the natural landscapes which 
cover this planet, or had used the experiences those places could offer. 
Starting on my own doorstep and later spreading, part of my work since has been 
to try and engage this potential. I see it as abstract art laid down in the 
real spaces of the world."

Are contemporary American playwrights intimidated by mythology? While such film 
makers as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg gleefully exploit Joseph Campbell's 
Territory of Myth, our theater artists often apologize for guiding an audience 
near the same archetypes. It's as if the stage, once a sanctuary for spiritual 
metaphors, now fears its own shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: "Early One Evening at the Rainbow Bar and Grille" at the Victory 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Graham's West Coast premiere dares to address several weighty themes. 
Subjects like the end of the world, Adam and Eve, God, morality and suicide are 
enlisted in the service of true love and even truer comedy. Evidently the final 
holocaust will come equipped with a laugh track. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that an unspecified apocalypse is wiping out mankind. Some people 
blame the Russians, others the Chinese, while those in the know claim it's the 
Arabs. Whoever or whatever triggered this plague or fallout, one thing is 
certain: The end is coming. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the folks in the Rainbow Bar and Grille, the mass extermination 
began somewhere in the Orient. While folks in the Rockies are dropping like 
flies, the neighborhood regulars can still belly up to the bar and knock back a 
few. "Out West everyone is dead," we learn, "but so far so good. So let's 
party!" 
</P>
<P>
Bartender Shep (Dick Christie) may be contemplating suicide, but why? Is it 
because the only show left on television is "I Love Lucy" reruns? Or because 
he's just received his first book advance -- and the check won't mean diddly 
squat if the world ends? 
</P>
<P>
But why kill yourself when you can kill your loved ones? Willie (Robert Schuch) 
shoots his wife and is stalking the dog that urinated on his tires. Roy 
(Donovan Scott) was sick to death of working on cars, but now he can watch porn 
movies at the firehouse and break into the K mart. Good-time Rainbow cocktail 
waitress Shirley (Tommie Minard) is determined to achieve her repressed dreams: 
Sex with Shep. 
</P>
<P>
And Shep? "Cheers," anyone? 
</P>
<P>
Why playwright Graham decided to balance a sitcom setting with the Apocalypse 
is anyone's guess. Of course, a death notice might trigger the inane antics of 
his protagonists. "What do you say to a guy who just shot his wife?" Without 
the impending end of the world, that joke would be improbable. 
</P>
<P>
But there's salvation in this bar and it enters just before the second act 
ends. Joe (David Ruprecht) arrives when all seems lost. He saves the play but 
not the day. A kind of droll Rod Serling figure intruding to explain the 
impenetrable situation, Joe gently twists the zaniness into a "twilight zone" 
genesis. 
</P>
<P>
Does this make "Rainbow Bar and Grille" a special event? No. What it does is 
adorn familiar situations and values with a VIP mythology. If God favors a 
martini, our limitations seem blessed. The play's far-out radical portents 
harbor very conventional boy-meets-girl, love-makes-the-world-go-round issues. 
</P>
<P>
The result? The portentous becomes pretentious. Jokes rule. 
</P>
<P>
Do we care? No. Do we laugh? Yes, in part because of the exceptional cast. 
Despite the absurdist events, Dick Christie maintains a deliciously deadpan 
persona and David Ruprecht is delicious as the Godot we've been waiting for. 
Perfect timing and perfect inflection allow Ruprecht's Joe to transform the 
Rainbow Bar and Grille into a new Eden. 
</P>
<P>
Director Bill Cakmis unashamedly plays the text for laughs. Pauses are for 
punch lines, not profundities. Forget myth; remember ratings. 
</P>
<P>
As mankind gets wiped out, a hysterical Schuch and a hilarious Scott lure us 
happily down. And once on the bottom, a devilishly over-the-top Tommie Minard 
takes care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Pennington as a feminist gym teacher is too strident, however. If fate 
has selected her character as the next Eve the new age won't be an improvement 
over ours. 
</P>
<P>
The production design is superb, thanks to Tori Nourafchan's precise bar decor 
and Buddy Tobie's suggestive lights. 
</P>
<P>
With all this talent and energy on its side, we still exit "Rainbow Bar and 
Grille" wishing its happy hour hadn't gone on so long. Perhaps a few complex 
philosophical questions might have let us exit laughing. Shep says it best: 
"God, I expected so much more. It's just like any other day. Where are the 
special effects?" 
</P>
<P>
You want a heavy thought? "What if he really is God? Can we leave him in the 
men's room?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the way contemporary playwrights end the world. Not with a bang but a 
tag line.

JOFFREY MAKING ITSELF AT HOME AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLI STEVENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joffrey Ballet veteran Beatriz Rodriguez smiles as she gazes out toward the 
hills and freeways that surround and create a relatively isolated, pastoral 
setting at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so different from the high-rise construction around (N.Y.) City 
Center," she says, describing the mid-Manhattan area where the company is 
based. "There you go outside and see nothing but buildings; here you have 
sunshine and trees." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and the five dozen dancers and staff members of the Joffrey Ballet 
are currently in residence at Cal State L.A. for a six-week rehearsal period 
that marks a new partnership between the Joffrey and the 20-campus California 
State University system. 
</P>
<P>
It also represents the company's first attempt to become genuinely bicoastal -- 
a promise made to Angelenos in 1983 when the Joffrey became the resident dance 
company at the Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the Joffrey has gone, we have always made inroads as builders, and we 
want to be a catalyst here in Los Angeles," explains artistic director Gerald 
Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an interaction that happens because the company is here," adds 
Joffrey executive director Penelope Curry. "It makes people feel they are 
really ours and we belong. Cal State L.A. has allowed us to bridge the gap. 
They have closed the circle on making the Joffrey a truly bicoastal company." 
</P>
<P>
The university is providing a handsome physical plant for the Joffrey in its 
fifth-floor complex at Martin Luther King Jr. Hall. Newly refurbished, it 
contains two practice studios and a rehearsal hall equipped with floors built 
according to professional standards, dressing rooms with showers, offices, a 
video room and a lounge for the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very well equipped," says Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Curry concurs. "They are the best facilities the company has ever had as far as 
an environment to rehearse in, and we will be sharing those facilities with the 
dance students at Cal State L.A. and the Los Angeles County High School for the 
Arts," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The university has also provided the company with access to all recreational 
facilities, including an Olympic-size pool and year-old student housing, "which 
is geared to condominium-type living," explains Dean Bobby R. Patton of the 
School of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York you feel like a pneumatic drill, but here you can't get me off the 
campus," Arpino says of his apartment. "I'm doing very concentrated work here 
and having the quiet of the campus and the outdoors brings your center to you 
in a more luxurious way." 
</P>
<P>
Future facilities available to the Joffrey for rehearsals and special 
performances include the $21-million Luckman Fine Arts Complex, which will 
contain a 1,200-seat theater and a smaller experimental theater and is 
scheduled for completion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, Curry sees an opportunity "to rehearse our ballets on a 
stage, to do photo calls and make special little showings in a proscenium 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Joffrey pays rent for the Cal State L.A. space, Curry points out 
that it is "substantially lower than we would pay anywhere else -- and though 
we will continue to perform at and maintain offices at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion as its resident company, Cal State will be our actual home as far as 
rehearsals are concerned." (A press conference scheduled today will announce 
further details of the residency.) 
</P>
<P>
The new relationship began 18 months ago when Cal State Chancellor W. Ann 
Reynolds and Arpino were discussing mutual interests. 
</P>
<P>
They concluded that bringing the Joffrey onto the campus would add a 
professional edge to the training program sought by Patton. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give the students an example of what the real world is going to be 
like after they get their bachelor's degrees," Arpino explains. "It will 
introduce a new way of sponsoring the arts by combining arts and education, at 
a time when we are threatened by cuts from Washington." 
</P>
<P>
And it will at last give the company and Arpino a physical home in Los Angeles 
where, he says, "I can come to create new ballets and be a part of a productive 
scheme." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a home base, the Joffrey will offer master classes, symposiums 
and workshops in dance, costume design, the technical aspects of production, 
business management and fund-raising in the arts as well as access to 
"Nutcracker" rehearsals this winter at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ensemble showings by Joffrey and Joffrey II dancers will be held on Cal State 
campuses throughout California, auditions for ballets will be held in King 
Hall, two- to three-day residencies by dancers during their off time in January 
and February are in the planning stages and, according to Patton, a "two-week 
tour of the campuses by Joffrey II is expected in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
"We are working out a five-year agreement with the CSU system, which will be 
finalized in the fall of 1989," says Curry. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that agreement, Patton says, involves locating a coordinator for the 
partnership who will "raise National Endowment for the Arts funds for matching 
grants to commission works that the Joffrey will be doing."

WOODY HERMAN HERD PERFORMS AT HERMOSA BEACH CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ghost bands are too often exactly what the name implies: dim and shadowy 
apparitions from a glorious past. But the current Woody Herman Herd is a 
vigorous, full-blooded exception. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night at the Civic Center in Hermosa Beach, the 15-piece unit displayed 
the qualities that have made the Herman name a virtual synonym for energy and 
swing for more than half a century. The program was an eclectic mixture of old 
and new -- from the classic "Woodchopper's Ball" to a brassy variation on Aaron 
Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Tiberi, a tenor saxophonist and clarinetist who has led the band since 
Herman passed away, took the spotlight here and there, most notably on "Body 
and Soul" and "Naima." More often, he turned the solo stage over to his large 
collection of gifted young stallions. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor-dominated saxophone section -- a staple of the Herd's sound since the 
late '40s -- was easily comparable to the best the band's ever had. Jimmy 
Giuffre's "Four Brothers," one of the great saxophone ensemble classics, 
sounded new and alive in the hands of Tiberi, tenors Tim McCall and Chip O'Neil 
and baritonist Mike Brignola. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Stout, taking most of the trumpet solos, contrasted a delicate variation on 
"Body and Soul" with a rip-snorting, plunger-muted "Greasy Sack Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Tiberi, like Herman before him, seems to recognize that the magic formula for 
the Herd consists of mixing eager young players with high-voltage 
orchestrations and standing aside to let the musical explosion take place. It 
worked for Herman, and it's working for Tiberi. You've got to think that the 
old Woodchopper would be proud of the current Herman Herd. 
</P>
<P>
The Woody Herman Orchestra also appears Thursday in a free concert at the 
Marketplace in Long Beach, and Saturday at the Loa Club in Santa Monica. DON

JAZZ NOTES : GENE BURKERT JOINS PONCHO SANCHEZ GROUP; CONGA DRUMMER JUST BACK 
FROM EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congero/bandleader Poncho Sanchez, who recently returned from his debut tour of 
Europe, has a new saxophonist. Gene Burkert, 25, who has been heard in Los 
Angeles with his own quartet and George Stone's Diajobu, has joined the busy 
Latin/jazz ensemble, replacing Kenny Goldberg, who was with Sanchez's band for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Though the decision to change reed players was made by Sanchez -- who fronts 
one of the few bands in jazz that both works steadily and maintains a fixed 
personnel roster -- both he and Goldberg agree the parting was amicable. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Kenny's playing and writing," Sanchez said Monday from New York, where 
his octet was playing the Village Gate nightclub, "but it just wasn't working 
out. It was time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
"It had been a good three years," Goldberg said, "but I want to pursue further 
musical challenges. I'm already involved in some new writing projects." 
Goldberg -- who plays Saturday with John Pisano and Velas at the Made in Brazil 
Festival at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium -- contributed several 
compositions to Sanchez's book. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Burkert is thrilled. "I'm working full-time and that will allow 
me a lot more time to work on musical things," he said from New York, where he 
is traveling with Sanchez. "I was teaching preschool part-time for the City of 
Beverly Hills before I joined Poncho and I found it difficult to come home 
after that and practice. I could say that my life is a little more relaxed now, 
though the band keeps me pretty busy." 
</P>
<P>
Burkert was recommended to Sanchez by reedman Gary Foster, with whom Burkert 
has studied for three years. Foster has known the conga drummer since Sanchez 
was a member of Cal Tjader's band a decade ago and plays a cameo alto spot on 
Sanchez's latest LP, "La Familia" (Concord/Picante). "Gary said Gene was one of 
his best students, and he fit in right from the start," said Sanchez, who plays 
at Sausalito South in Manhattan Beach next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said his first European trek, which included the Pori Jazz Festival in 
Pori, Finland, and the Grande Parades du Jazz in Nice, France, was rigorous. 
"We took 14 plane flights in 16 days, and some of those were followed by four- 
and five-hour bus rides." 
</P>
<P>
But rewarding. "It was good. Everybody wants us back. People are finally 
starting to get hip to us, so I don't think we better break up the band just 
yet," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tour's highlights was when trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Arturo 
Sandoval, the Cuban ace brassman, sat in with Sanchez's band at Sardinia, 
Italy. "That was a gas," Sanchez exclaimed. "We do some of Dizzy's tunes like 
'Manteca' and 'A Night in Tunisia.' Dizzy told me, 'Hey, we should do this more 
often.' " 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to the Southland, Sanchez -- who recently purchased a new home 
in Norwalk -- made a guest appearance on a Sandoval date produced by the 
drummer's manager, Frank Marrone. "That was great," Sanchez said of the session 
that spotlighted the multifaceted Sandoval, who was a founding member of 
Irakere and who stills resides in Havana. "That guy's got chops." 
</P>
<P>
**** Alan Broadbent's "Away From You" (Trend) is modern mainstream trio music 
with definite shelf life. The pianist, bassist Putter Smith and drummer Frank 
Gibson Jr. vigorously investigate the nine numbers, storming into "Pent-Up 
House" and dancing spritely through "Daahoud" and "Sonny's Step." "Footprints" 
is serenity in motion, and the title track, a bittersweet ballad, exposes 
Broadbent's finest asset: his never-cloying lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
****"Twilight Is Upon Us." Windham Hill Jazz. This new album by pianist Billy 
Childs is a kind of primer on how to compose and play contemporary jazz without 
losing any of the values of the past. Echoes and reverberations of Herbie 
Hancock, Wynton Kelly, Horace Silver and Bill Evans drift through almost every 
piece, despite the cutting edge qualities of the rhythms, harmonies and 
structures. Childs' piano playing, improving by leaps and bounds, is beginning 
to cohere into one of the unique voices in contemporary music. A recording that 
sets the pace for the coming jazz of the '90s. DON HECKMAN

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: PACIFIC SYMPHONY'S AUDITIONS WERE ANYTHING BUT 
FIVE EASY PIECES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 200 candidates for the 14 openings at the Pacific Symphony have come and 
gone, leaving behind memories, broken hearts, seven happy potential new hires 
and many fatigued audition committee members. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tremendously exhausting," said concertmaster Endre Granat, who heard 
about 75 musicians try out in the last 2 1/2 weeks for just 11 spots in the 
string section. "It's a tremendous responsibility. The person's fate is in your 
hands. . . . Also, the orchestra's future was in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 musicians responded to the orchestra's ad for string and trombone 
openings in the May issue of International Musicians newsletter. About 200 took 
the next step of confirming dates to play before audition committees (made up 
of orchestra principals) at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. They had to pay their own transportation and hotel costs. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure anonymity, applicants auditioned from behind a large black screen. 
Those who survived the preliminary cuts repeated the process at the finals, at 
which music adviser Kazimierz Kord joined the committees. 
</P>
<P>
Seven were expected to sign contracts offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim was to the hire the best for this orchestra at this particular 
juncture," Granat said. "Everything is so crucial. The orchestra is progressing 
from the little ugly duckling. . . . It's tremendously important to do 
everything right. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity that probably will be never again repeated. . . . The 
musicians will be there to stay. Conceivably, they could be staying with the 
orchestra for 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
Violinist candidates began with a movement from Bach's Partita No. 2, "so we 
had objective comparisons," Granat said. 
</P>
<P>
They followed that with excerpts from two of Mozart's violin concertos and 
orchestral passages from symphonies by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann, 
plus Strauss' "Don Juan" and Britten's "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Granat said the quality of the applicants ranged widely, as they auditioned 
anywhere from three to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some had three minutes and we saw it was hopeless. Forget it. But when they 
showed some promise, we had to (decide) whether the person was nervous or 
inept. If we thought they were nervous, we went straight back to the Bach. We 
passed quite a few people onto the finals that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept asking more and more, tougher things, trying to find where are the 
limits." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members took notes and at intervals would discuss the applicants, 
whom they knew only by numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Principal trombonist William Booth said: "The one satisfaction in this process 
is that there was generally agreement at that particular moment on who sounded 
very good or who were the better candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members then voted. 
</P>
<P>
Principal cellist Stephen Erdody said that in the preliminaries, "generally the 
vote was 5 to 0, 4 to 1. Very few times it was 3 to 2. . . . We could tell 
within the first 10 to 15 seconds of the audition. It was real clear when 
someone came and had something to offer. Only occasionally -- and it was very 
occasionally -- did someone come back (after a poor start) and really knock our 
socks off." 
</P>
<P>
Erdody said the most common problems among the string applicants were playing 
rhythms incorrectly and not following the dynamics indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very surprising," Erdody said. "People would play forte from the word 
go. . . . It was really nice to hear some play who followed the dynamic scheme 
and played the right rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
The trombonist applicants shared these problems, according to Booth, "but most 
of all it was a matter of concept, of the appropriate character or style of the 
various excerpts." 
</P>
<P>
The committees and Kord decided not to offer a contract for the post of 
assistant concertmaster because "we didn't come across the right person," 
Granat said. 
</P>
<P>
"For that position, we expect a little more. There is no room to be nervous as 
assistant concertmaster. One first (requirement): The guy has no nerves. . . . 
No question, you have to be able to play every single note just right and not 
just well, but in a musical manner." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the committee members thought that the auditions were handled as 
fairly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been involved in anything so careful on that level," said tuba 
player James Self, a member of the trombone committee. "Most top orchestras 
don't really get that assertive about (maintaining anonymity for the 
applicants), especially in the finals. Almost all of them take the screen down. 
. . . Here, I had absolutely no idea who anybody was. I liked that." 
</P>
<P>
But Granat, who also called these auditions "the fairest I have ever been 
involved in, on either side of the fence," said there is one drawback to the 
strict anonymity: 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do with someone who plays the solos beautifully but not the 
orchestra excerpts? If that person is 18, that's fine. They can play with the 
orchestra and grow. If they're 55, that's another matter. But we had to go by 
strictly on what we heard." 
</P>
<P>
Booth too had some reservations about the system. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were rather careful not to be overly harsh," he said. "I'm sure, 
though, that there were some good players (who were) not passed onto the finals 
for one reason or another. It may have been they didn't have a good day or were 
nervous. That's always possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, when looking for the best musicians, you can only go on what you hear at 
the time."

SLIMMED-DOWN PHILHARMONIC PLAYS POPS AT BOWL BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When is the Los Angeles Philharmonic not the Los Angeles Philharmonic? That, 
and other conundrums for inquiring minds, was raised by an otherwise innocuous 
pops concert at Hollywood Bowl Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, "A Night of Great Movie Music," was a benefit for Robert Redford's 
Sundance Institute and the Hollywood Bowl -- the Bowl in this case being the 
name for one pocket of the Philharmonic, devoted to capital projects. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra onstage was not the Los Angeles Philharmonic, however. It was 
only "Members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic," though many members, to be 
sure. This being a night off for the orchestra, participation was optional, and 
thus that large and capable band could not be the Philharmonic, or so the hazy 
official logic went. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the conducting assignments fell to David Newman, including the suites 
from Max Steiner's "Gone With the Wind" and the Stothart-Arlen "Wizard of Oz" 
scores that closed the evening in tribute to 1939. The performances were big -- 
with the amplification seemingly pumped up a notch over usual symphonic levels 
-- and broadly gauged. 
</P>
<P>
Another trio of film composers took the podium for examples of their own work. 
Maurice Jarre led a sweeping account of a generous sampling of "Lawrence of 
Arabia," David Raksin conducted inevitable music from "Laura," and Alan 
Silvestri -- greeted by a young voice from the audience calling out 'Daddy!' -- 
guided a high-voltage account of "Back to the Future," the lone exemplar of the 
flashy contemporary style a la John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Clips from "The Wizard of Oz," "Marnie" (music by Bernard Herrmann) and "Day 
for Night" (music by Georges Delerue) accompanied the excerpts from their 
scores. The clip from "The Natural," featuring Redford prominently, seemed the 
reason for programming the sample of Randy Newman's score. Stills supported 
other items, including "Gone With the Wind." Attendence: 12,936, most of whom 
seemed to have flash cameras they were not shy about using.JOHN HENKEN

An Algerian expelled from France hijacked an Air France jet with more than 100 
people aboard today by threatening to blow up the plane over the Mediterranean, 
but he was armed only with soap and toilet water and surrendered peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, a 30-year-old shopkeeper identified as Said Jamel, stepped off 
the Airbus at Algiers airport brandishing a plastic bag holding the soap and a 
bottle of cologne, to give an impromptu Tarmac news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before being arrested, he told assembled journalists that he had wanted 
to draw attention to the situation in Palestine and war-torn Lebanon. France 
has warships off Lebanon to protect its citizens there. 
</P>
<P>
Jamel, described by French radio as "mentally deranged," had been placed on the 
flight by French police at Paris' Orly airport after being expelled from France 
for "disorderly conduct," a Paris airport source said.

SOLIDARITY, UNDER PRESSURE, AGREES TO GIVE COMMUNISTS GREATER POWER

<P>
Prime Minister-designate Tadeusz Mazowiecki, under pressure from Polish 
Communists and the Soviet Union, promised today to give the party more than two 
ministerial posts in the Solidarity-led government he is forming. 
</P>
<P>
Two ministries, defense and interior, had previously been promised to the 
Communists. The two ministries control the police and the army. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, speaking to the Solidarity caucus in the National Assembly, said 
that with the Communists retaining control of those powerful ministries, it 
would be foolish to try to exclude them from the rest of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The speech by Mazowiecki followed a 40-minute telephone talk Tuesday between 
party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 
which it was agreed that it was "impossible" to have a government without the 
Communists, a party spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
It was highly unusual for the party to publicize such a telephone conversation, 
announcing it at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be a Trap' 
</P>
<P>
The announcement appeared designed to stress the Soviet Union's interest in 
having a strong Communist presence in the next government but it still 
reflected Moscow's acceptance of the idea that the party should reach an 
accommodation with the Solidarity-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki warned the Solidarity deputies that limiting the Communists to just 
two ministries could backfire. "The Communist Party in total negation would be 
a trap for the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hinting that the party would eventually take back power by force unless a 
compromise was reached, he said: "No opposition in the world which . . . has 
the army and security services . . . remains the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Our new partners must not feel like secondary partners." 
</P>
<P>
The lower house of the National Assembly, the Sejm, is to vote Thursday on 
Mazowiecki's nomination. Ratification is expected because Solidarity leader 
Lech Walesa has put together a Solidarity-led majority by wooing two minor 
parties formerly allied with the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki did not say how many government ministries will be apportioned. He 
said he plans to present a government within a week. 
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said that Mazowiecki's envoy, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 
had his first preliminary coalition talks on Tuesday with party Central 
Committee Secretary Leszek Miller. Bisztyga refused comment on the party's 
coalition demands. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said that there are no specific decisions but that it must be a 
"broad coalition." 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broad coalition 
having the support of all forces sitting at the Sejm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki told the Solidarity lawmakers that he has President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski's assurance that the army and security forces will cooperate with a 
government led by the opposition movement they had long sought to repress. 
</P>
<P>
He also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalists from state 
jobs. He said he plans no "witch hunts" when he takes over. His only criteria 
for employment will be "competence and loyalty to the new government," he said.

ANAHEIM MAN, 2 TEENS WOUNDED IN GANG-RELATED DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

An Anaheim man and two teen-age boys were being treated this morning for wounds 
they suffered when they were hit by several shotgun blasts fired from a passing 
car in a gang-related drive-by shooting late Tuesday night, Anaheim police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Acosta, 21, of Anaheim and two 15-year-old boys, whose names were 
withheld because of their age, were standing at Citron Street and Victor Avenue 
in north Anaheim about 11:25 p.m. when shots were fired from a car, Anaheim 
Police Lt. John Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were shot in the legs and the other was wounded in the arm, 
Cross said. The wounds were not considered life-threatening. The three remain 
in stable condition at area hospitals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that the shots were fired from a red sports car that sped 
north on Citron Street, Cross said, and minutes later crashed into a tree at 
Romneya Drive east of Euclid Street. Police recovered the shotgun believed to 
have been used in the attack, but four people ran from the accident scene, 
Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had some leads this morning, but no suspects have been arrested, he 
said.

WINE TRAIN TO ROLL THROUGH NAPA VALLEY

With warm congratulations to all parties, the state Public Utilities Commission 
today gave its unanimous approval to a settlement that will allow the Napa 
Valley Wine Train to start passenger service through the famed wine valley in 
about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
NVWT President Jack McCormack immediately announced that service between Napa 
and St. Helena will start Sept. 15, with twice-daily service Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays and Thursdays and three-times-a-day service on Fridays, Saturdays 
and Sundays. The agreement provided that passengers will remain on board during 
the entire three-hour, 36-mile round trip. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's approval process for "preliminary limited service," took about five 
minutes and followed months of negotiations by the agency, the NVWT and a 
coalition of valley opponents to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, with the understanding that pending court cases remain to be 
resolved, obliges the railroad to submit to an environmental impact review, 
among other provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The rail line has been embroiled in a hassle with the Napa Valley 
establishment, including the city of St. Helena and many wineries, over 
expectations that regular rail service would further crowd a valley already 
jammed by 2 million tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also claimed that locomotives would be blowing their horns day and 
evening as the trains rolled through the valley, intermittently blocking the 
many intersections that cross the tracks from California 29.

Vatican officials are studying the feasibility of an immediate trip by Pope 
John Paul II to Lebanon, Vatican and diplomatic sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat accredited to the Vatican said: "The word is out. He wants 
to go and they (at the Vatican) are looking for a way to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope made a strong appeal for peace in Lebanon on Aug. 15, accusing Syria, 
which has about 33,000 troops in Lebanon, of seeking to destroy the country. He 
said the recent upsurge of violence, in which at least 760 civilians have died 
in artillery battles since March, had given him an "interior command" to go to 
Lebanon. He was praying the obstacles to such a trip would be removed.

A federal judge today refused to stop distribution of a book about former 
Marine Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, who was court-martialed in the sex-for-secrets 
scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Lonetree claimed that the book, "The Court-Martial of Clayton Lonetree," is 
based on confidential information obtained by his defense team and jeopardizes 
his appeal. His complaint filed earlier this month named publisher Henry Holt 
and Co. Inc. of New York and sought $100,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>

Two pro-choice candidates trounced an anti-abortion candidate in a Republican 
primary Tuesday to fill a vacant state Assembly seat, putting them in a runoff 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
The primary was South Carolina's first election since the U.S. Supreme Court 
last month gave states more latitude to restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results, former legislative aide Holly Cork led with 
2,654 votes to 2,226 for developer David Ames and 1,805 for Robert Graves, a 
businessman who opposes abortion, said Beaufort County Republican Party 
Chairman Frank Gibson.

The Environmental Protection Agency said today that Ford Motor Co. will recall 
about 450,000 late-model Ford and Mercury cars that exceed federal hydrocarbon 
exhaust emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said Ford agreed to install a new air-control valve to increase airflow 
into the exhaust manifold for more complete combustion of exhaust gases. 
</P>
<P>
Cars registered in California, built to tougher emission standards, are not 
involved in the recall, the EPA said.

Digital Equipment Corp., with a partial hiring freeze already in effect, today 
said it has an internal contingency paper that asks overhead departments to 
propose cuts and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Although a company spokesman declined to estimate how many employees might be 
affected, the document reportedly calls for reductions of as much as 25% in a 
wide range of "overhead" departments that could translate into a reduction of 
as many as 7,500 employees over two years. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions and related transfers that might result would be aimed at the 
company's estimated 30,000-member support staff and thus likely would most 
severely affect the areas around its headquarters. But a spokeswoman said 
"these are global decisions" and suggested the plan would affect employees 
worldwide.

MILKEN MAY GET $100-MILLION PAY FOR 1988

Federal prosecutors are considering whether to reverse course and allow Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. to pay Michael R. Milken more than $100 million for work 
he did last year, sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The provision barring Drexel from paying its indicted former junk bond trader 
his 1988 compensation was included in the investment firm's formal settlement 
of criminal securities fraud charges with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The withholding has been controversial because Milken has not been charged with 
any wrongdoing in 1988. Milken has challenged the provision in U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be named, said prosecutors 
have not made a final decision on whether to pay Milken his compensation, 
estimated at more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
But they indicated that a reversal may be made because legal experts have 
criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and that the 
government may not want to start its case against Milken off on the wrong foot. 
</P>
<P>
They said that ending the lengthy delay in Drexel's plea in the case was not a 
factor in reconsidering the payment provision. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carroll and a Milken spokesman all declined 
comment.

AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland conceded today that organized labor is on the 
defensive but said "it's the only side to be on" when faced with an offensive 
from corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, joined at a labor rally by a host of labor leaders and hundreds of 
trade unionists -- many of them on strike against Bell Atlantic, Pittston Coal 
Group and Eastern Airlines -- decried the 1980s wave of entrepreneurs trying to 
"loot, pillage, strip and dismantle" companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Is labor on the defensive?" Kirkland asked. "Realistically, yes . . . because 
a new type of company is on the attack. They are not just attacking trade 
unions, they are attacking the basic principles on which the country was 
founded." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials estimated the crowd at 1,500, although police put the figure at 
about half that.

FIFA, world soccer's ruling body, rejected an appeal today by Chile to let it 
host a crucial World Cup qualifying match against Venezuela and ruled the match 
should be played in Argentina. A FIFA communique said the match on Sunday will 
take place in Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
Chile's soccer association appealed to FIFA on Tuesday to overturn its ban on 
the country hosting the Venezuela match. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA imposed the suspension last Friday as one of a number of sanctions 
following disturbances at the Aug. 13 match between Chile and Brazil at the 
capital's stadium. The FIFA communique said charges against the Chilean 
association included poor organization of the game, during which home fans 
threw objects at the visiting team, the referee and linesmen.

Six-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis teamed up with three other American 
running stars today to break the 11-year-old world record in the 800-meter 
relay, clocking 1 minute, 19.38 seconds at the Koblenz international track 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Lewis combined with Danny Everett, LeRoy Burrell and Floyd 
Heard to better the old mark of 1:20.26 posted in 1978 by a USC team. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial time posted just after Lewis blazed across the finish was 
1:19.37, but it was later officially adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
The four Americans, racing for the Santa Monica Track Club, entered the meet 
with the intention of establishing a world record. 
</P>
<P>
The American team boasted some of the world's premier sprinters, including 
Lewis, the Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Everett rocketed in front at the start of the race, handing over to Burrell. 
After the next handoff, Heard lost some ground to the Santa Monica Track Club 
II team, also competing in the race. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, cheered on by a crowd of about 15,000, blasted down the last 200 
meters after taking the baton, far ahead of Mark Witherspoon of the other Santa 
Monica team. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. club team shaved 0.88 of a second off the time despite two untidy 
baton changes. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell looked to have blown their chances when he seemed to take off too early 
from his mark in the first changeover with Everett. Lewis also had to slow 
slightly before he received the baton from Heard and ran the anchor leg.. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the untidy baton changes could have ruined the team's chances, a 
delighted Lewis responded: "What do you want? We broke the world record, didn't 
we?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted for the club," he added. "It has produced a lot of good 
sprinters over the years, some of the best. 
</P>
<P>
"The record belongs to all four of us, not just me."

Stock car driver Tim Richmond contracted AIDS "through heterosexual contact" 
and died of complications from the disease at age 34, a physician close to the 
driver's family said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David W. Dodson, the attending physician at the time of Richmond's death 
Sunday, confirmed earlier reports that Richmond had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The driver's family decided that information about the case should be released 
in the hopes that it will "save others from having to endure the suffering Tim 
experienced," Dodson said in a statement. The cause of Richmond's death 
previously had been listed as "natural." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed in 1986 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's condition was diagnosed as AIDS in 1986 while he was hospitalized at 
the Cleveland Clinic for pneumonia, Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to dispel any rumors as absolutely untrue that he contracted the 
disease through intravenous drug use, homosexual encounter or a blood 
transfusion," Dodson said. "Tim died of complications of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, which he contracted through heterosexual contact." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's best year on the NASCAR circuit was in 1986 when he won seven races 
and finished third in the Winston Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the illness, Richmond won two straight races in 1987. Later that year, 
he missed a race because of complications from AIDS, Dodson said.

Louisiana State fullback Darrell Williams has been suspended for three games 
because of a bar fight that sent two men to a hospital, Coach Mike Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
Archer said Williams was at fault for the incident outside the Tiger bar, which 
led to his suspension from the games against Texas A&amp;M, Florida State and 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, Williams got into an argument and then a fight 
with Ray P. Fitch, 21, of Baton Rouge and a man identified only as Darrin 
Kimble. It said Fitch and Kimble both went to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, 
where they were treated and released. Both told police at the time that they 
planned to press charges against Williams, but both said Tuesday that they were 
dropping the matter. Williams said he agreed to pay the hospital bills of the 
two men.
