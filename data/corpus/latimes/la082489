POSSIBLE FIRST FOR RANCHO SANTA FE: PICKETS TEE OFF AGAINST GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A chanting group of International Ladies Garment Workers Union members picketed 
the Rancho Santa Fe Golf Course Wednesday to protest the marketing of La Mode 
golf clothing. A security guard said it was the first such event in the club's 
recent history. 
</P>
<P>
The group of about 40 picketers, who came down from Los Angeles in a van 
caravan, picketed the members-only club for an hour or so, distributing 
leaflets asking golfers to boycott the clothing company's wares. 
</P>
<P>
"We find this a very effective way of getting the word out on the boycott," 
said David Young, Los Angeles organizing director for ILGWU. "Some of the 
golfers get a little upset because, after all, this disturbs their leisure, 
their recreation. I know it offends their sensibilities, but this is war." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Courtney, golf professional at the club, said the "whole thing was a 
mistake because the golf shop doesn't handle the products (of the La Mode 
brand) and hasn't for about a year or so." 
</P>
<P>
A deputy from the Encinitas sheriff's station stopped by to monitor the unusual 
Rancho Santa Fe event but found the picketers to be abiding by the law. Rancho 
Santa Fe Assn. staff members said the picketing went unnoticed by most 
residents of the exclusive estate community, but some golfers were disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard who has patroled Rancho Santa Fe for the past nine years said 
it was the first labor union picket he had ever seen or heard about in the 
wealthy community north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of the mostly Hispanic female workers at La Mode went out on strike 
July 17, Young said, after the company refused to allow a union election sought 
by 90% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues in the strike are the workers' wages, which the union wants 
raised from $4.25 to $5 an hour, lack of medical benefits, and working 
conditions, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, in the Watts area of Los Angeles, specializes in embroidering 
sportswear, including sweaters, shirts and hats, and wholesaling them to golf 
shops nationwide. Company executives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Santa Fe Golf Course was not singled out for the informational 
picket, Young said. Picketing has been going on since July 18, including 
demonstrations at Lawrence Welk Village north of Escondido, Shadowridge Golf 
Club in Vista and the La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 golf shops have signed pledges to remove La Mode golfwear from their 
shelves and not to sell any of the company's products during the labor strife, 
Young said.

Mention the American antelope and most people think of the plains of Wyoming, 
which has more of the fleet-footed pronghorns than people, roughly half a 
million. But the antelope (antilocapra americana) is native to California, too, 
and has been making a remarkable comeback since the 1930s when there may have 
been fewer than 1,000 of the animals left, primarily in the far northeastern 
corner of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Today, according to an article in the current issue of Outdoor California, the 
magazine of the state Fish and Game Department, there are an estimated 8,000 
antelope in widely scattered habitats, including the Antelope Valley of Los 
Angeles and Kern counties, the Carrizo Plain in the San Joaquin Valley, Mono 
County, the central coast range and Lassen and Modoc counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Game Department is planning more relocations as the major herds in 
Modoc County reach the carrying capacity of those ranges. Areas under 
consideration include the west side of the Sacramento Valley, the Carrizo 
Plain, the Antelope Valley and San Benito County. 
</P>
<P>
The antelope is a unique species native to the Americans plains and deserts. It 
is not related to the African antelope, according to Outdoor California, and is 
not a member of the goat family as many believe. The antelope is characterized 
by its two pronged horns, black blazes on its nose and around the eyes, white 
markings on the neck and shoulders and its prominent white rump. The pronghorn 
has excellent senses of sight, smell and hearing to protect it against 
predators, and is the fastest land animal in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope break up into small groups during the summer and are difficult to 
spot. But they mingle in larger herds in the winter and often are visible along 
U.S. 395 and State Route 299 in Lassen and Modoc counties -- another sign of 
the amazing natural diversity of the state of California.

MADAGASCAR SWAP

<TEXT>
<P>
I am almost certain to be the only one from Madagascar to live in Southern 
California. So when I saw the article Aug. 4 about the $1 million 
debt-for-nature swap, I decided to write. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you America. 
</P>
<P>
I know there must have been official thanks, but this is from a simple citizen 
who often feels sorry for his country. The idea is good. I thought of other 
ones: how about debt-for industrialization, debt-for education, debt-for 
transportation, debt-for-hygiene? 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar is a precious country, and not enough people know that. Madagascar 
needs help. That's why I came to study here. Thanks again.

Editors at The Times have their priorities painfully confused. The editorial 
merely groused about the slow payment of dollars for Japanese reparations, yet 
The Times ignored the anniversary of V J Day, ending World War II, which cost 
so many American lives. Why didn't The Times honor them?

UNNAMED SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your news analysis, "Media Assuming Key Role in Hostage Crisis Dealings," Aug. 
11 (Part I), shows again why the public is not served by the use of 
unattributed sources and how a lack of checks and balances on the ultimately 
profit-motivated press is . . . a dangerous thing. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times says their story citing a U.S. threat of military action if 
the hostage Joseph Cicippio had been killed was not a one-source story. The 
number of sources is not the issue; the identity of the sources is. If The New 
York Times had identified the sources, they could have "stood by their story" 
by pointing to its source and would not have to defend against criticism that 
the piece was an Administration plant by saying, "Trust me, I'm a journalist." 
</P>
<P>
When journalists have big bucks, careers and reputations on the line and 
politicians are made or broken in the media, common sense says not to put blind 
faith in journalistic integrity. I say, if a story is worthy reporting to the 
public, name at least one source. And name the confirming source as well, if 
possible. The public has a right to know.

MUSEUM AND DON MUCHMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on conflict at the California Museum of Science and Industry 
failed to make clear just how important the contribution of the California 
Museum Foundation is to the quality of the institution. Virtually all of the 
resources for the renaissance of the outdated, run-down museum came from the 
fund-raising of the foundation under the leadership of Muchmore. It confirms 
our lowest expectations of state bureaucrats that they should be so 
antagonistic to a group of volunteers who have produced huge donations to 
support a state institution. 
</P>
<P>
I worked for Don Muchmore as chief curator from 1982 through 1987, during its 
expansion and renovation into a state-of-the-art science center. He brought an 
energetic, goal-driven style into a somnolent bureaucracy. Your description of 
him as "imperious" and making "unilateral decisions" does not jibe with the 
experience of the professionals he empowered with extensive authority and 
opportunity during the rebuilding of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Muchmore and the California Museum Foundation deserve gratitude, rather than 
antagonism, from the state for the renaissance of the museum. The efforts of 
the bureaucrats to destroy the foundation are likely to return the museum to 
the dreary embarrassment it used to be.

Enough is enough! Our government should keep its promise and immediately pay up 
and send a letter of apology to all Americans of Japanese extraction interned 
during World War II. They have suffered greatly, psychologically and 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
No other group of American citizens whose national extraction was that of our 
Axis enemies during World War II were subjected to the humiliation that our 
fellow Japanese-American citizens endured. 
</P>
<P>
Justice delayed is justice denied. Let's do the right thing now and work to put

RECTIFYING A TOXIC MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sponsor of Proposition 65, the 1986 Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement 
Act, says that voter approval of the complex, controversial measure created a 
year of panic followed by a year of acceptance. The major remaining resistance 
comes from the national food industry, says David Roe of the Environmental 
Defense Fund. And now Roe and his allies are enjoying a major legal victory 
over that foe. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was well-deserved. The grocers' attempt to circumvent the law by 
creating a toll-free telephone information center clearly was not within the 
Proposition 65 requirement that products carry a "clear and reasonable" label 
if they contained significant amounts of suspected carcinogen or a substance 
likely to cause birth defects. It certainly was not within the spirit of the 
law, which is to give consumers the information they need to make rational 
decisions about the relative risk of the items they ingest or use in daily 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers calling the Ingredient Communication Council hot line could not get a 
list of all products coming under Proposition 65. Rather, they had to ask about 
each specific product and then be told whether it contained any suspect 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of warning would suffice? It is unclear, but a store might post a 
symbol in a prominent place and note that any item so marked was covered under 
Proposition 65. This would not be as unwieldy as Proposition 65 critics 
contend. All food and drug items certified by the federal government are exempt 
from labeling for the time being. That leaves only about 500 items, including 
some 300 brands of tobacco products and shoe polish, Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
And is Proposition 65 achieving some of the goals the sponsors sought? Yes 
indeed. Roe cited the fact that lead solder no longer is used in the 
manufacturer of food product cans that are in use in California. Proposition 65 
still is a very cumbersome law, but it can be reasonably effective if it is 
reasonably interpreted and reasonably enforced.

EX-TORRANCE OFFICER DENIES COVER-UP IN '84 FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Torrance Police Officer Timothy Thornton on Wednesday denied allegations 
made earlier this week that he and other officers concealed a police sergeant's 
drunkenness on the night of a fatal 1984 traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton testified in Los Angeles Superior Court that he never admitted being 
part of a cover-up to protect Sgt. Rollo Green, contradicting testimony Monday 
by Timothy Pappas, another former officer. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting testimony grows out of a lawsuit filed in 1984 by John and 
Geraldine Rastello of San Pedro, whose son Kelly, 19, died in the traffic 
collision with Green. The suit alleges that nine members of the Torrance Police 
Department covered up Green's drunken driving as part of a pattern of 
whitewashing police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crash Reconstruction Expert 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also heard Wednesday from another defense witness, a crash 
reconstruction expert who said Rastello caused the late-night crash by speeding 
on his motorcycle and not applying his brakes properly. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, 30, told jurors that he smelled alcohol on Green's breath after the 
crash but that the off-duty sergeant did not appear to be drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Casey Yim then asked Thornton if he had made the admissions 
that Pappas described: that he had covered up, admitted lying in a pretrial 
deposition and said that others lied, too. "No sir," a stone-faced Thornton 
answered repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Rastello family attacked Thornton's credibility, asking him 
about two incidents in which he allegedly lied. The first allegation led to 
Thornton's suspension and the second to his firing, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
In the first case, Thornton said he was accused of falsifying a report to make 
it look as if he had proper cause to make a marijuana arrest. Although he 
continued to deny the allegation Wednesday, Thornton acknowledged that his 
superiors sustained the accusation and suspended him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Discussion 
</P>
<P>
Only limited details of the second incident were discussed in court because of 
an order by Judge Abby Soven. But because of criminal charges involving other 
officers, many of the facts have previously been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was a witness to the incident in May, 1988, when Pappas shot an 
unarmed man, Patrick J. Coyle, whom he had pulled over during routine patrol. 
Coyle was partially paralyzed as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports about the incident say that the three officers at the scene -- 
Pappas, Thornton and Mark Holden -- all said that Pappas fired his gun after 
Coyle moved suddenly, as if to reach for a weapon. All three officers were 
fired later when Thornton told police supervisors that the story was a lie and 
that Pappas fired his gun without provocation. According to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher Darden, the shooting appears to have been accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Darden subsequently offered Thornton immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
his testimony against Pappas and Holden. The two officers are scheduled for a 
preliminary hearing Sept. 12 in Los Angeles Municipal Court on two felony 
charges -- conspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy to falsely charge 
another with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and Holden have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speeding Cited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, crash reconstruction expert Harry Hurt told the jury that 
his study of the crash showed that Kelly Rastello was speeding at 57 m.p.h. and 
applied only one of his two brakes before he crashed into the side of Green's 
pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle had just stopped at a light, Hurt testified, and "was not just 
going fast, it was going almost as fast as it could go." 
</P>
<P>
Skid marks at the crash scene, the intersection of Rolling Hills Road and 
Whiffletree Lane, show that Rastello only applied his rear-wheel brake, Hurt 
testified. He said that if Rastello had used his front brake, too, he would 
have had plenty of time to avoid the collision with Green. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt told the jury that test stops at the scene of the crash proved that a 
motorcycle like Rastello's can stop in time when it is not speeding and, even 
when traveling too fast, when both brakes are applied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparent Inexperience 
</P>
<P>
Hurt said that Rastello's apparent inexperience may have led to his failure to 
apply both brakes. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs' attorney Browne Greene said during intense cross-examination that 
Hurt failed to consider all the factors in the crash. He said Hurt neglected to 
account for the fact that Green admitted he had been drinking; could not 
explain how Green failed to see the motorcycle until the last second, and drew 
inaccurate conclusions because his reconstruction was based on incorrect 
assumptions about the accident.

SUPPORTERS PRAISE BRADLEY AS ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About two dozen supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley rallied at City Hall on 
Wednesday to praise Bradley as a role model for black children, despite his 
current problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real hero in Tom Bradley," said Dr. James Mays, a Watts-based 
physician who helped organize the rally, attended by about a dozen homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Hayes, a homeless activist who attended the rally, admitted that he has 
been at odds with Bradley but said the mayor deserves support because of his 
years of service and obstacles he overcame to become mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably been the biggest critic of Tom Bradley over the years," Hayes 
said. "Nonetheless, the mayor is a role model for our children. 
</P>
<P>
"We are saying, 'Young people, if you do like Tom Bradley, work hard day and 
night for what you want, you will achieve. You don't have to deal drugs. You 
don't have to carry AK-47s. You don't have to do those kinds of things to be 
somebody.' 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe a man should be kicked when he is down," Hayes added. "A 
homeless man can understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said Bradley is one of the few symbols of success for blacks outside of 
the entertainment and sports fields. He urged the public to await the outcome 
of conflict-of-interest investigations of Bradley's financial dealings before 
judging the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
A homeless man who watched the rally from the City Hall lawn complained that 
Bradley has not done enough to solve homelessness. He said that homeless people 
were offered free bologna sandwiches to attend the rally. But organizers said 
the homeless could have obtained a free meal without participating in the 
rally.

Palos Verdes Estates residents, afraid of overdevelopment and wall-like 
business buildings, won height and density concessions Tuesday from the City 
Council during a three-hour public hearing on development standards for 
commercial and multifamily residential zones. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively small zones are in Malaga Cove, near the Malaga Cove Plaza and 
City Hall, and along Palos Verdes Drive West in Lunada Bay. The city has few 
vacant lots, so the proposed regulations would apply largely to redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with opponents, who mustered petitions, letters and an audience of 
more than 60 people at the hearing, the council modified height controls -- 
initially proposed as a blanket reduction from 40 feet to 35 feet -- to ensure 
that new structures would be no higher than those they replace. Several 
residents who live behind commercial zones said they fear that older structures 
built considerably below the permitted height could be replaced with taller 
buildings that would block their views. 
</P>
<P>
The council also called for a 1,800-square-foot lot area for each dwelling unit 
in the multiple-residential zone. Even though the council said the 
1,400-square-foot requirement originally proposed would allow far fewer units 
than the existing 349, residents wanted more restrictions on density. 
</P>
<P>
While modifying development controls, the council left intact some proposed 
parking provisions -- including a parking area in front of City Hall and use of 
a nearby vacant street right of way -- that also drew fire at the hearing. Carl 
G. Allen, who lives near City Hall, said there is "no planning basis" for such 
proposals. But the council characterized them as concepts that may or may not 
be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Among other proposals are specific off-street parking for businesses, an "in 
lieu" fee that would be paid by businesses unable to provide the required 
number of parking spaces, and formation of a committee to advise the council on 
implementing parking plans. Also proposed is a site review process, similar to 
an existing one for homes, to ensure that developments are compatible with 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the development proposals -- put together over the last year by 
the Planning Commission and a subcommittee of council members, staff and 
representatives of the Palos Verdes Homes Assn. -- are intended to update 
40-year-old regulations and to address matters not covered by the code, 
including condominium conversions, screening of mechanical equipment and the 
percentage of a commercial lot that a building may cover. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics said the proposals threaten the quality of life for which people 
moved to the city, but the council contended that the changes would tighten 
development controls rather than relax them. Councilman James Kinney said the 
proposals "upgrade ordinances for life in the 1990s. Our existing ordinances 
are ill-equipped to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission will consider the changes ordered by the council and 
may hold a hearing on them Sept. 19. A moratorium on commercial construction in 
Malaga Cove and Lunada Bay will remain in effect until the council takes final 
action on development plans.

COMMISSION TAKES 1ST STEP TO BUY CHANDLER-VICTORY RIGHT OF WAY; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL DENIES THAT ITS MOVE IS DECISION ON RAIL ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission on Wednesday voted unanimously 
to take a first step toward purchase of a little-used 14-mile railroad right of 
way that is one of two routes under consideration for a San Fernando Valley 
mass transit line. 
</P>
<P>
Despite strenuous objections from leaders of homeowner organizations along the 
route, the commission authorized hiring an appraiser to determine the value of 
the Southern Pacific railroad's Burbank branch line between North Hollywood and 
Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairwoman Christine Reed said commissioners have made no final 
decision on a Valley route and are "merely protecting the land from being 
developed before a decision is made on where to put the rail line." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the commission also voted to open negotiations with the owner of land 
on the alternative Ventura Freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the Southern Pacific route, which roughly parallels Chandler and 
Victory boulevards across the Valley, is a poor choice for a high-speed transit 
system because it traverses too many residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Parcel 
</P>
<P>
But rail experts have long favored it, noting that despite the proximity to 
homes, the right of way is available in a single parcel, and that it connects 
several major activity centers, including Valley College, the Van Nuys 
government center and Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific, which has gradually cut back to just one freight train each 
week on the Chandler-Victory line, recently brought the debate to a boil by 
announcing that it plans to sell that line and several others in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
If transit officials do not buy the rights of way, railroad officials say they 
will sell the land piecemeal to commercial and industrial developers. 
</P>
<P>
In another rebuff to homeowner group representatives Wednesday, the commission 
voted unanimously to buy three parcels from Southern Pacific that are adjacent 
to the Chandler-Victory line and to open negotiations with the owner of two 
parcels in Woodland Hills south of the proposed Ventura Freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imminent Development 
</P>
<P>
The five Valley parcels, all of which face imminent development, have a total 
estimated value of $46 million, commission staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five parcels would be appropriate station sites, while the other, 
in Canoga Park north of Victory and parallel to Canoga Avenue, is ideal for a 
rail maintenance and storage yard, staff planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Land not ultimately used for mass transit could be sold, presumably at a 
profit, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the trains, traveling as frequently as every three minutes during 
peak commuting hours, would ruin their quiet neighborhoods with noise, ground 
vibrations and visual blight. Near stations, which typically are about one mile 
apart, residential streets would be swamped with parked cars, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating an accusation frequently lodged by rail opponents, Marilyn Minkle of 
Reseda, who lives near the Chandler-Victory route, accused the commission of 
hastily moving to build a cross-Valley line because it would "provide 
developers of Warner Center with a legitimate excuse for expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Although public opinion surveys indicate that there is strong support for a 
cross-Valley rail line, homeowner opposition along the two possible routes is 
well-organized and has backing from several elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
A commission-ordered, $2.1-million study of the two proposed Valley routes is 
scheduled for completion in October. The Chandler-Victory land value appraisal 
is due in November. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners plan to pick a route by March and at the same time determine 
whether the system should be ground-level light rail, an extension of the 
downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway route, which also passes through several residential areas, would 
be on pillars on the freeway's south shoulder. In initial studies, planners say 
it would be more costly than the Chandler-Victory line and would create mammoth 
traffic tie-ups wherever stations were built at freeway intersections with 
major north-south streets.

HAWTHORNE INCREASES FEES, AVOIDS 32 WORKER LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Averting as many as 32 layoffs, the Hawthorne City Council has increased 
numerous municipal fees to offset a $2.5-million deficit in the city's 1989-90 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The increases will raise nearly $800,000 and will help the city achieve a 
$44.6-million balanced budget for the current fiscal year, according to City 
Manager R. Kenneth Jue. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the deficit will come from several sources, including: 
</P>
<P>
* $165,000 in further cutbacks by the city manager, including cutting one 
full-time position to half time and eliminating the risk manager's position, 
which is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
* $550,000 from a recent increase in the franchise fee for trash collection 
</P>
<P>
* $512,000 from Northrop Corp. for back sales taxes from 1983-85, a delinquency 
detected by a state audit. 
</P>
<P>
* Partial repayment of as much as $1.5 million of a city loan used by the 
Redevelopment Agency to build the Hawthorne Plaza shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Any excess funds will be added to the city's $1-million reserves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Fees to Double 
</P>
<P>
Under a series of 11 resolutions approved Monday by the City Council, city fees 
will double for some services, including zone-change applications, and will 
increase 30% for others, including building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The increases will bring Hawthorne fees up to the average prevailing in 
surrounding cities, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new revenues, no layoffs will be necessary, Jue said after 
Monday's marathon five-hour budget session. Last month, Jue had said that as 
many as 32 layoffs might be needed to make up the budget deficit and that one 
of the city's fire stations, near the Holly Glen residential neighborhood, 
might have to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 7 budget message, Jue told the council that the city's budget was in 
serious trouble because two major sources of expected income failed to 
materialize. The city received $1.1 million less in sales tax revenues and 
paramedic fees than had been projected in 1988-89, and an equal shortfall is 
expected for 1989-90, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
A $300,000 expenditure for hiring five police officers made up the rest of the 
deficit, Jue said. The hiring of the officers, who will be assigned to traffic 
law enforcement, was retained in the budget adopted Monday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Fees Affected 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously on a long list of fee increases in numerous 
departments, including building, planning, engineering, police, airport and 
recreation. Hundreds of fees will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
During the public hearing, City Council candidate Raymon Sulser talked for 1 
1/2 hours about the budget, challenging expenditures line by line and proposing 
that the city close its youth camp, which he described as a frill. 
</P>
<P>
Several other members of the public, including Councilman Steve Andersen's 
mother, Dorothy Andersen, were upset at Sulser's suggestion on cutting back the 
youth camp. "If you only knew how hard we worked to get those things," she 
admonished Sulser, urging that the council not cut back on recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sulser also said the city could save $2 million a year by contracting with the 
county for fire services rather than having its own department. But Fire Chief 
Roger Milstead said the county could not provide cheaper services because its 
salaries are higher than the city's across the board, from firefighter to fire 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contention Repeated 
</P>
<P>
Sulser on Monday repeated his contention that last fall's increase in the 
city's water fees was a violation of Proposition 13. That measure and the 
subsequent Proposition 62 barred cities from imposing new taxes without 
approval by a two-thirds' majority of city voters. Cities can, however, pass on 
to the public the cost of providing city services. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Andersen, a real estate attorney, disputed Sulser's claim about the 
legality of the increase. He asked for a memorandum from the city attorney's 
office on the legality of the city's water and trash collection fees. He said 
he believes the city is on solid legal ground, and said to Sulser: "If you're 
convinced you're right, why don't you file a taxpayer's suit?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to pay for it?" Sulser retorted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council introduced a new ordinance that would increase minimum 
monthly water fees by about $2 a month, to $5 for residential customers. 
Customers also pay fees based on the amount of water used. The council is 
expected to vote on the water increase at its next meeting Monday.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAYING IS CITY'S 39TH HOMICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Inglewood man was killed Monday night in what police say was a 
gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Cozari Brown was the 39th killing in Inglewood this year, the 
highest number of homicides since 55 people died in the city in 1980, police 
said. A rise in gang violence is a major contributor to the increase in 
homicides, Sgt. Harold P. Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who police said they believe was a gang member, was walking with a group 
of men at about 10 p.m. in the 10100 block of South Woodworth Avenue when a car 
pulled alongside. The car's occupants and the pedestrians exchanged words, and 
a passenger got out and opened fire on the group with a handgun, police said. 
The gunman got back in the car and the driver sped off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics treated Brown at the scene. He later died at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital.

L.A. DEFIES STATE, PLANS SLIGHT INCREASE IN DUMPING AT LOPEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation on Wednesday renounced what it described 
as its voluntary compliance with a state request to limit trash dumping at 
Lopez Canyon Landfill, saying it would no longer abide by the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The change in policy -- another step in a running dispute between city and 
state agencies over the dump -- is not likely to lead to large increases in the 
amount of trash taken to Lopez Canyon, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
During an April meeting among city, county and state officials, the city 
estimated that it was dumping an average of 4,000 tons -- about 400 garbage 
truckloads -- daily at the northeast San Fernando Valley dump. City officials 
had agreed to maintain that level until disputes with the state over a 1978 
permit, which referred to a 3,100-ton-a-day limit, could be settled. 
</P>
<P>
Since then a state order restricting operations at the dump has been issued, 
but that order limits the height of garbage mounds and the number of trucks 
allowed to dump at the landfill, not daily tonnage. The city is challenging the 
order, issued by the state Waste Management Board, in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered Wednesday to the county Department of Health Services, 
which polices the dump for the state, city sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi 
said that the 4,000-ton limit was never formalized and that the city may begin 
dumping more than that amount from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More in Each Truck 
</P>
<P>
Even though the landfill is abiding by a state-imposed limit of 400 trucks a 
day, Biagi said the same number of trucks may be able to carry about 75 to 100 
tons more than the present 4,000 tons a day -- an increase of about 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, said terminating 
the informal limit stemmed partly from the state's unwillingness to negotiate 
on its order attempting to impose the other limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to be bullheaded and totally unreasonable," Avila said. "But 
frankly, they are being bullheaded and totally unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management Board spokesman Chris Peck said he had not yet seen Biagi's 
letter and could not comment on it. He said the state wants to see the tonnage 
at the dump scaled back to 3,100 tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Coffee, who heads the county's solid waste management program, said the 
additional amount of trash that the city will be able to squeeze into 400 
trucks is not significant. 
</P>
<P>
However, anti-dump activist Rob Zapple said the city is "playing with semantics 
to circumvent the intent of the law."

'GREEN CARD' TO TAKE ON PINK HUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it a pink card. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. immigration officials Wednesday unveiled the new document that is being 
issued to legal permanent resident foreigners. It will replace the 
long-cherished "green card," which, in fact, hasn't been green for several 
decades, the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The face of the new card, known formally as an I-551 form, will have a "rose" 
or "off-pink" color, an INS press release stated, and the back will have a 
"pink to blue rainbow effect shading on the top portion, with the bottom 
portion being white." Like its predecessor, it will contain the photograph, 
signature and fingerprint of the bearer. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more here than just a color change. 
</P>
<P>
The new card, noted Vicki Quainton, acting deputy INS district director in San 
Diego, will replace a version that has been frequently duplicated by fraudulent 
means. Many thousands of false "green cards" are in circulation, the INS 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
The key aspect of the new card, the INS says, is that it will be readable by 
computerized machines, a fact that will make it easier to authenticate at ports 
of entry and at INS offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Another major difference: The new cards will have to be renewed every 10 years. 
The previous cards were issued permanently. PATRICK McDONNELL

MAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTATION TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former part-time recreation assistant at Reseda Park was ordered held for 
trial on charges of child molestation Wednesday after a 6-year-old boy 
testified that the city employee was one of two men who abused him in the park 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Lars Juden, 38, who has coached young people in athletics at the park since 
1983, is to be arraigned Sept. 6 in Van Nuys Superior Court. Juden, who 
remained in custody in lieu of $7,500 bail, faces up to 10 years in prison if 
convicted on two counts of molestation, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R. 
Abele. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Tuesday at Juden's preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court, the child said Juden and Ronald Ray Rudd, a 39-year-old volunteer at the 
park, molested him more than once in the park office, although he could not say 
how many times. 
</P>
<P>
Rudd also molested him in the van that Rudd lived in across the street from the 
park, the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Convictions 
</P>
<P>
Rudd, who admitted that he has twice been convicted of child molestation, 
pleaded guilty Monday to the molestations, which he said occurred during the 
six weeks before his and Juden's arrest Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea bargain, Rudd will be sentenced to at least 15 years in prison. 
Sentencing is set Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Detective Joseph Diglio said Juden, shortly after his arrest, 
signed a confession admitting the molestations. 
</P>
<P>
He quoted the former park employee as saying, "If the kid didn't come to the 
park alone, these things wouldn't happen" and that "it was Ronald Rudd's fault 
because he was an influence on him." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother testified that she allowed the boy to visit the park alone up 
to five times weekly in July and that she also permitted Rudd to take her son 
to movies and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles parks department spokesman Al Goldfarb said Juden has been fired 
from his position.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose and Commissioner Bart Giamatti reached a compromise Wednesday calling 
for the Cincinnati manager to be suspended -- but not banned for life -- for 
having bet on baseball, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti announced Wednesday night that he would hold a news conference in New 
York today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commissioner did not say officially what the news conference would 
be about. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the situation said the news conference will involve 
Rose's suspension. However, the sources were not sure of the length of the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
United Press International reported the length would be five years. 
</P>
<P>
Several baseball sources said Giamatti pushed for a settlement because he was 
afraid the case would continue to linger in court, preventing him from 
disciplining Rose. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Rose needed to settle because he believed that Giamatti 
ultimately would suspend him once Rose's legal appeals were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's need for a settlement increased once baseball successfully moved the 
case into federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, under investigation since Feb. 20, obtained a temporary restraining order 
from an Ohio state court on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
That order has prevented Giamatti from holding a hearing on the gambling 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was accused by bookmakers and other acquaintances of betting on baseball, 
including games involving the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for baseball compiled a 225-page report that concluded Rose bet 
on the Reds from 1985-87 and cited evidence that included betting slips alleged 
to be in Rose's handwriting, and telephone and bank records. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled to begin 
on Monday in federal court in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Reds owner Marge Schott, contacted at her home Wednesday night, said she had 
received no word from the commissioner's office about the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I know nothing about what's cooking," she said. "I'm going to wait for 
tomorrow and see what happens."

MCMAHON PLEASED -- WITH NEW DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE QUARTERBACK LEARNS, IT HELPS KEEP CHARGERS CLOSE TO 49ERS

<P>
The Chargers have played two games in the six days since they traded for 
Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon. And the thing of it is this: 
</P>
<P>
In those two games, the Charger defense has looked more like the Super 
Bowl-champion Bear defense of 1985 than McMahon has looked like the NFC Pro 
Bowl starter from the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about this team, especially its defense," McMahon said after the 
defending NFL-champion 49ers beat the Chargers 17-14 Wednesday night at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
All three San Francisco scores resulted from special team errors or 
interceptions. The Chargers have lost two of three exhibition games, but their 
defense has allowed fewer yards than its opponent all three times. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who started and played through the first series of the second half, 
was less excited about his own performance, which included seven completions in 
13 attempts for 26 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be a leader," he said, "until I start producing on the field." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "In the next 10 days I should be able to get the offense down 
pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning said it was "amazing" what McMahon has learned in his 
short time with the Chargers. Quarterback Coach Ted Tollner said he was 
"pleased" with what McMahon did on the field against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
But for the second consecutive week it was rookie Billy Joe Tolliver who came 
off the bench in the second half to throw two touchdown passes. Last Saturday 
night, Tolliver's pyrotechnics fired the Chargers to a 24-7 victory over the 
Bears in Chicago. This time, Tolliver almost brought the Chargers back from a 
17-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was a disputed holding call on left guard Dan Rosado that 
stopped Tolliver (9 for 15 for 138 yards) and the Chargers late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty nullified a three-yard burst off right tackle by running back 
Marian Butts that would given the Chargers a first down at the 49er 25 with 
three minutes to play. Instead, they had to settle for a 53-yard field goal 
attempt by Steve DeLine that fell short. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how he (the official) could see a holding in that mass of 
humanity," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosado, described in the Charger press guide as being "of Puerto Rican dissent" 
dissented even more hotly than Henning. "Maybe it's a minority thing," he said. 
"Maybe he (the official) doesn't like Puerto Ricans." 
</P>
<P>
It's more likely the official wasn't aware of Rosado's descent. And it's even 
more likely that the Chargers will take consolation today in the fact that, in 
a five-day period, they cumulatively outscored two teams that won a combined 
total of four Super Bowls in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's a coincidence that McMahon arrived at a time when the Chargers chose 
to show they may be the most improved team in the AFC West. Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim McMahon," said San Francisco free safety Ronnie Lott, "is the closest 
quarterback to Joe Montana in understanding what it takes to win in this game. 
For McMahon to step in there tonight and accomplish what he did is a feat in 
itself. You have to measure players by their heart. McMahon's got a huge one." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of McMahon upon Charger season ticket sales has been immediate. In 
six days since the Friday trade that brought McMahon from Chicago, nearly 1,000 
people purchased Charger season tickets. That, according to Jack Teele, the 
Chargers' director of administration, is "two to three times" the normal number 
at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was great good news for the Chargers, a team that averaged 
fewer than 30,000 fans in the last two home games of 1988. The football seating 
capacity at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is 60,750. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's presence has permeated the organization. By Monday, one of the 
secretaries in the public relations office had placed a "McMahon" headband 
around the head of the small, stuffed puppy over her desk. 
</P>
<P>
The other marquee quarterback in this game, Montana, made a cameo appearence, 
He played one series of downs and completed one of three passes for 33 yards 
before giving way to Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon moved the Chargers smartly in the first period, completing five of 
seven passes as the Charger offense converted four of five third-down 
situations. Unfortunately for them, they didn't score any points even though 
they possessed the ball 11 minutes and 24 seconds to San Francisco's 3:36. 
</P>
<P>
At least part of the reason for McMahon's early success was the absence of 
three-fourths of the 49ers' starting defensive backfield. Cornerbacks Tim 
McKyer and Don Griffin and strong safety Jeff Fuller have all been involved in 
contract disputes. None of them played against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second period, McMahon led the Chargers all the way to the 49er 
three-yard line. Vince Abbott made a 21-yard field goal, but a delay-of-game 
penalty nullified the three points. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Abbott missed a 26-yarder when he hooked it left. 
</P>
<P>
The message? With McMahon off the field, the Chargers of 189 looked like the 
Chargers that finished 6-10 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The downside? On most of his incompletions, McMahon was either wild high or not 
strong enough with his throws to deliver the ball into the tight spots that 
Henning's offense demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was sailing," McMahon said. "It was windy. But no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's worst throw of the half occurred just inside the two-minute warning. 
It whizzed over Dana Brinson's head and directly into the waiting arms of Lott, 
who returned the ball to the Charger 21. 
</P>
<P>
Six plays later, San Francisco led, 7-0, when Young found tight end Wesley 
Walls deep in the end zone for a two-yard touchdown pass just nine seconds 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's numbers for first half: six completions in 12 attempts for 30 yards 
with one interception and no sacks. Former Redskin Timmy Smith, bothered most 
of training camp by a sore ankle, led all first-half rushers with 56 yards in 
13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers needed 16 seconds to double their lead when Terrence Flagler returned 
Chris Bahr's second half kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. No Charger touched 
Flagler on the play. And, coupled with Abbott's missed field goal, it continued 
a downward spiral for assistant Joe Madden's special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Following an early interception, Tolliver regained his composure late in the 
third period after a Gill Byrd interception gave the Chargers a first down at 
their own 49. Three plays later, Tolliver found rookie Marian Butts on a short 
pass over the right side. Butts broke three tackles and turned it into a 
38-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Byrd intercepted another Young pass, this time giving Tolliver 
field position at the San Francisco 43. And Tolliver cashed again, this time 
needing six plays. the final 16 yards came on a touchdown pass to Darren 
Flutie, who beat former Charger defensive back Wayne Davis in the left corner 
of the end zone.

DOCTOR SAYS RICHMOND DIED OF AIDS

Stock car driver Tim Richmond contracted AIDS from an unknown woman and died of 
complications caused by the disease, a physician close to the driver's family 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way of knowing who that woman was," David W. Dodson said at a news 
conference. "Tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma -- a handsome guy. He 
naturally attracted a lot of women." 
</P>
<P>
Dodson, who specializes in internal medicine and infectious diseases here, 
first treated Richmond in February, 1987, and was the attending physician when 
the NASCAR driver died. 
</P>
<P>
Secrecy surrounding Richmond's death Aug. 13 at Good Samaritan Hospital had 
fueled speculation about the cause, which officially was listed as natural. 
Dodson said the driver's parents had decided to release information about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost a son to AIDS, and they don't want other parents to lose a son," 
Dodson said. "There's a lesson to be learned from Tim's death. A young active 
man was struck down because of AIDS, and it happened because of his sexual 
activity. People need to take precautions." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's parents did not attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going through their own nightmare right now in dealing with their 
son's death," Dodson said. "The added publicity was making their ordeal much 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Beach Post and ESPN had reported that Richmond, who was 34, had 
suffered from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson said that Richmond, who was single, was diagnosed as having the disease 
in 1986 while hospitalized for pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to dispel any rumors as absolutely untrue that he contracted the 
disease through intravenous drug use, homosexual encounter or a blood 
transfusion," Dodson said. "Tim died of complications of Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome, which he contracted through heterosexual contact." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's best year on the NASCAR circuit was 1986, when he won seven races. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the illness, Richmond won two consecutive races in 1987. The next week, 
he missed a race because of complications from AIDS, Dodson said. And shortly 
thereafter, he resigned from his racing team. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR suspended Richmond in February, 1988, after a drug test showed that he 
had used banned substances. Dodson said that Richmond told him he had not used 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A later test showed that Richmond had used nonprescription drugs found in 
over-the-counter remedies. NASCAR lifted the ban, but demanded his hospital 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond refused because he didn't want to disclose his illness, and his 
refusal prevented his return to racing, Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson also said that the family had established a memorial fund in Richmond's 
name to benefit AIDS research.

BENES GETTING PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
PADRE ROOKIE BEATS PHILLIES FOR FIRST VICTORY IN MAJORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just like every other baseball fan, Andy Benes was up late Tuesday night, his 
eyes glued to the TV set, watching the highlights of Nolan Ryan's 5,000th 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Unbelievable, Benes thought. The guy is 42 years old, and he's throwing 
96-mile-an-hour fastballs. Benes hopes he's just able to play catch with his 
kids at that age. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the replays of the historic moment, and all of the interviews, 
Benes was about to turn off the TV when something caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
There was an illustration from a sports scientist on just why Ryan is able to 
continue throwing so hard. It showed a stick figure representing how Ryan 
starts his motion, keeps his weight back and doesn't thrust forward until he 
brings his leg down. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that picture on the screen," Benes said, "and it kind of opened my eyes. 
I hadn't been bringing my leg down, and it's hurt me a little." 
</P>
<P>
Benes took the new-found knowledge to bed, reminded himself of what he learned 
before taking the mound Wednesday night against the Philadelphia Phillies and 
promptly won the first game of his major-league career. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres defeated the Phillies, 7-3, at Veterans Stadium while a crowd of 
20,455 watched Benes allow just three hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what you can pick up watching TV, isn't it?" Benes said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the most remarkable aspect of Benes' performance was that it was the 
worst among his three big-league outings. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't even close," said Pat Dobson, the Padre pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Dobson said, smiling widely, "When you don't have good stuff and still 
pitch like that, well, there's no telling what he's capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Said Benito Santiago, who has caught each of Benes' games: "I'm telling you, 
he's going to be great, really great. He's got the arm, and it's going to get 
better still. It'll take him some time, and then watch out." 
</P>
<P>
Benes hardly resembles the pitcher that was bounced around in five starts at 
triple-A Las Vegas, yielding 41 hits in 26 innings and compiling a 8.10 ERA. 
And to think that he was in double-A just six weeks ago, and never spent a day 
in the Padre major-league camp. It is little wonder that Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon believes he'll be going into the 1990 season with one of the premier 
pitching rotations in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets a couple of more games under his belt and gets all of the jitters 
out," McKeon said, "there's no telling what he'll do. No question he belongs 
here. That was my contention all along. The only way you can find out is to put 
him in there." 
</P>
<P>
And now that he's up here, well, let's just say that the next time Benes visits 
Las Vegas, it'll be on vacation. He'll leave his spikes at home in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only time I ever want to go back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, he said, he's content to live like a vagabond. He's got 
clothes in his van, which is sitting in a Padre secretary's driveway. His wife 
is staying at a hotel he has no idea how to find. And their baby for the next 
10 days will be in Evansville, Ind., with the grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
The inconveniences are a headache, but the memories forever will be cherished 
-- particularly the night of Aug. 23, when he got his first major league 
victory and what the Padres firmly believe is the start of a stellar career. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is," Dobson said, "he's just learning. He doesn't even know where 
his breaking pitches go yet, whether they'll drop, whether they'll break or 
whether they'll stay flat. Just wait and see what happens when he gets those 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"You ain't seen nothing, yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies hardly saw anything, consistently behind on Benes' fastball when 
they were not swinging and missing. They pulled the ball just four times into 
the outfield off Benes, while four struck out and eight others couldn't get the 
ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The only time Benes was hurt by any of his 115 pitches was when Ricky Jordan 
hit a hanging slider for a two-run homer in the fourth, cutting the Padres' 
lead to 3-2. No matter. The Padres came right back and scored two more in the 
fifth and one each in the sixth and seventh, putting the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon decided that Benes had enough after seven innings and, with a 7-3 lead, 
said, "I was going to make sure he won. He wasn't going to lose this one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to get Cy Young performances out of him every time, but he's 
making progress, a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
Really, the only person who has been disappointed with Benes' first two starts 
was Benes himself. Never did the Padres waver on their thinking after his 0-2 
start and 7.30 ERA in two appearances. They just had to convince Benes that 
everything was all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you can't live up to everybody's expectations," he said, "but I expect 
a lot out of myself. I was disappointed with my two starts. I was starting to 
wonder if I was ever going to get one. I really didn't want to go back to San 
Diego 0-3, and that was in the back of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he celebrated the victory being teased by his teammates for talking at 
length with the press. They rushed him during his post-game meal just so he 
could among the first to board the bus on the way to a 5 1/2-hour flight home. 
</P>
<P>
Benes, who turned 22 last Sunday, just laughed. He could care less how much 
teasing there was on this night. Nothing was going spoil the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a night I'll never forget," he said. "I got the game ball with me, and 
it'll go right with the ones I got in a (Olympic) game in Korea, and one I got 
in the (NCAA) regionals. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll get a few more down the line, too." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Chris James, who had spent his entire 7 1/2-year career with the 
Phillies organization before being traded June 2 to the Padres, had dreaded the 
past week and the trip to Philadelphia. He stayed awake, wondering what their 
reaction would be. Would they boo him, as they did so many times this season? 
Would they cheer him sarcastically, now that he's with a different club? Would 
they simply ignore him? Much to James' delight, they treated him just like any 
other visiting player, greeting him with a smattering of cheers and boos. By 
his last at-bat Wednesday night, the boos were louder. James got hits in each 
of his first three at-bats and wound up three for five with a run-scoring 
double, raising his batting average to .294 since joining the Padres. "To tell 
you the truth," James said, "I'm glad these three days are over with. I was 
nervous as hell coming here. But now, being here these past few days, I know 
San Diego is home." . . . Pitcher Bruce Hurst, who left Tuesday's game with a 
strained left groin, traveled to Boston on Wednesday to see Dr. Arthur Pappas. 
The Padres still were awaiting word of the report when they left the stadium 
Wednesday night. . . . The Padres stole a season-high five bases, including 
three by second baseman Roberto Alomar. . . . Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn was 
held out of the starting lineup for the second consecutive day, allowing Shawn 
Abner to start. It turned out to be a treat for Abner, who grew up an hour away 
in Mechanicsburg, Pa., and left 13 tickets on the pass list. Abner went two for 
four with an RBI.

Carl Lewis teamed with three Santa Monica Track Club sprinters Wednesday to 
break the world record in the 800-meter relay at the Koblenz international 
track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, and teammates Danny Everett, LeRoy 
Burrell and Floyd Heard finished in 1 minute 19.38 seconds, besting the mark of 
1:20.26 set in 1978 by a team from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Their record came despite a sloppy exchange between Heard and Lewis and 
highlighted a banner day for U.S. athletes, who won six men's and three women's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Everett took a big lead as the starter, and Burrell maintained it during his 
second leg. Heard, running third, lost some ground to the Santa Monica Track 
Club II team. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, cheered on by 15,000, accelerated during the final 200 meters after 
taking the baton, far ahead of Mark Witherspoon of Santa Monica II. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans entered the meet with the intention of establishing a world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Kariuki of Kenya, an Olympic champion, won the 3,000-meter steeplechase 
in 8:12.18, but failed to break the world record set last month by countryman 
Peter Koech with a time of 8:05.35. 
</P>
<P>
In a duel in the men's 100, Witherspoon finished 0.01 of a second ahead of 
second-place Robson Da Silva of Brazil, winning in 10.16. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Gray won the 800 in 1:43.98. Mark Rowe took the 400 in 45.44 and fellow 
American Kevin Young won the 400 hurdles in 47.94. The United States also won 
the women's 400 relay in 43.43. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Davis of the Bahamas won the women's 100 in 11.15, followed by Mary 
Onyali of Nigeria in 11.25. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Jackson of Jamaica won the women's 400 in 50.93; Angela Chalmers of 
Canada won the 3,000 in 8:46.64, and France's Monique Ewanje Epee took the 100 
hurdles in 12.77. 
</P>
<P>
Susi Faver of the United States battled with Britain's Lorraine Bakker to win 
the 800 in 2:00.56. Larry Myricks of the United States won the long jump in 27 
feet 8 inches, and American Jan Wohlschlag won the women's high jump with a 6-4 
1/2.

CBS BUYS RIGHTS TO 1994 OLYMPICS; 
</P>
<P>
WINTER GAMES COST $300 MILLION; ABC, NBC DO NOT BID

<P>
With ABC and NBC refusing to bid, CBS bought rights to the 1994 Winter Olympics 
for $300 million Wednesday -- $57 million more than it paid for the 1992 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
Its purchase of the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway, gives the network 
consecutive Winter Games as part of its long-range bid to regain the lead in 
prime-time ratings, CBS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important step for us in our whole programming strategy," said 
Howard Stringer, CBS Broadcast Group president, whose network last year bought 
radio and TV rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
That purchase, for $243 million, marked the first time since 1960 that CBS had 
bought broadcast rights to televise a Winter Olympics. That first acquisition 
of the TV rights to the Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Calif., cost $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
CBS made its surprise announcement at a news conference here shortly after the 
deal was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The starting price for the bargaining for 1994 was $300 million, said Barry 
Frank, a New York-based consultant to the Lillehammer Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
That price obviously was not right for ABC, and apparently scared away NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, said his staff had spent considerable 
time getting ready for bidding, but when the International Olympics Committee 
"informed us that CBS was prepared to guarantee approximately $300 million, we 
decided that this was substantially in excess of what the value (of the Games) 
would be to NBC and its affiliates." 
</P>
<P>
President Dennis Swanson of ABC Sports, which paid the winter record of $309 
million for rights to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and which had 
televised 10 of the previous 12 Olympics before that, had no comment on CBS' 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Neal H. Pilson, president of CBS Sports, said it had been CBS' strategy to 
acquire both Winter Games and that he fully expects each to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will have about 120 hours of coverage for the 1994 Games, about four hours 
more than for the 1992 Games, with about 55 hours of each in prime time. Pilson 
made no estimate of how much of that would be live. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, ABC, digging in its heels over rising prices and changes in bidding 
arrangements, refused to bid for the 1992 Winter Games, saying it "would not 
engage in a multistage auction." 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which last December paid the overall Olympic record of $400 million for 
rights to the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, also took a pass on the 
Winter Games for that year afterrefusing to offer more than $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol wasn't available for further comment, but an NBC source explained that 
the IOC had told NBC officials in May that CBS was guaranteeing at least $290 
million for rights to the Games. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC officials, the source said, were told that NBC executives hadn't even 
seen the Norwegian site, not far from Oslo. An NBC delegation visited the site 
two weeks ago and considered the CBS offer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the source said, they told the IOC "that if that's what they're (CBS) 
offering, then take the money and run." 
</P>
<P>
To help defray costs of its winning bid for the 1992 Summer Games, NBC plans 
what will be a the first involvement in the Olympics by cable TV, even though 
cable has steadily nibbled away at network audiences over the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
NBC expects to announce this fall the sale of lesser events at the Barcelona 
Games on a pay-per-view basis. The showings would air on SportsChannel, which 
serves about 8 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pilson suggested that CBS might not sell its Winter Games events to 
cable in either 1992 or 1994. 
</P>
<P>
No decision about seeking what he called a "cable package" has been made, 
Pilson told reporters, but with rights to both Olympics now in hand, CBS can 
consider that "or make a decision to keep them totally on the network." 
</P>
<P>
The CBS purchases, totaling $543 million, are not the network's biggest sports 
buy. CBS last year won exclusive rights to televise major league baseball games 
for four seasons, from 1990 through 1993, for slightly more than $1 billion.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF YOU WANT TO TALK ODDS, ROSE SAYS HE'S THE WRONG GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Cincinnati's last trip to San Francisco, Red Manager Pete Rose asked for a 
room on a lower floor of the hotel. What he got was a room on the 41st floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Two and half hours later," Rose told the Atlanta Journal, "an earthquake hits. 
Man, I got up and looked out my window and figured out that if the hotel had 
tipped over I would have come down five blocks away, in the middle of a 
Wendy's. And now they say there's a chance we might get another one in the next 
five days -- and we're here three more days." 
</P>
<P>
One writer, according to the Journal, told Rose, "Yes, but the scientists say 
the odds of it are only 50-1." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't talk about odds to me," Rose said. "You're talking to the wrong guy." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Kevin Mitchell is the sixth member of the New York-San Francisco 
Giants to hit 40 or more homers in a season. Name the other five. 
</P>
<P>
Good call: Red Murff, a New York Met scout, filed this report on 17-year-old 
Nolan Ryan of Alvin, Tex., in 1964: "Skinny right-handed junior. Has the best 
arm I've ever seen in my life. Could be a real power pitcher someday." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ryan: Chicago White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg, who caught no-hitters by both 
Ryan and Sandy Koufax, told USA Today: "When you talk velocity, Nolan threw the 
hardest. Nolan threw it harder than any human being I ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1973 against the Boston Red Sox, Nolan threw a pitch a little up and over 
my left shoulder. I reached up for it and Nolan's pitch tore a hole in the 
webbing of my glove and hit the backstop at Fenway Park." 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: At the Hall of Fame ceremony, Haywood Sullivan, part 
owner of the Boston Red Sox, revealed that Carl Yastrzemski got the last major 
league hit off Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, then manager of the Kansas City A's, said: "We were playing the Red 
Sox on a very, very hot day and Paige gave up a hit to Yaz in about the third 
inning. He hadn't given up a hit until then and it was a flare into the 
outfield. I went out and got him right away." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he was so quick with the hook, Sullivan said: "He was cooked. When I 
got out there and asked him if he was ready to come out, he just looked at me 
and said, 'Where ya been?' " 
</P>
<P>
Paige was 59. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mel Ott, Johnny Mize, Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda, Willie 
McCovey. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Ott won six National League home run titles but didn't win the title the 
only time he hit 40 or more homers. In 1929. Philadelphia's Chuck Klein was the 
leader with 43 homers, followed by Ott with 42. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Bob Hertzel of the Pittsburgh Press, on Pirate second baseman Jose 
Lind, who is hitting .241 at night and .190 in daytime: "He has reacted worse 
to sunlight than Count Dracula."

Ben McDonald, chosen by the Baltimore Orioles as the top pick in this year's 
amateur draft, gave up five hits and one run in three innings for Class A 
Frederick on Wednesday night in his professional debut. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching before a sellout crowd of more than 5,000 at McCurdy Field, McDonald 
struck out the first batter of the game for his only strikeout and threw 45 
pitches in all, 24 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, 21, also balked and threw a wild pitch, but did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
The Keys, a Carolina League team playing the Winston-Salem Spirits, helped him 
out with a triple play in the second inning and a double play in the third. The 
game was tied, 1-1, when McDonald left.

EVERT MAKES 49 UNFORCED ERRORS, FALLS TO ANNE MINTER

<P>
Chris Evert, retiring after next week's U.S. Open, committed 49 unforced errors 
Wednesday night and lost to Anne Minter of Australia in the second round of the 
Player's Challenge tennis championship at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rusty," said Evert, who lost, 6-4, 7-5. "I haven't played a tournament in 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid the price of not having played a match since Wimbledon. It's 
uncharacteristic of me for the past 18 years not to have been in every point. 
That's one of the reasons why I'm retiring." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, seeded third, credited Minter with "playing a great match." 
</P>
<P>
Minter, ranked No. 41 in the world, said it was "an honor" to play Evert again 
before she retires. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for her," Minter said. "I know she wanted to go out on a good 
note." 
</P>
<P>
In another upset, seventh-seeded Hana Mandlikova lost to unseeded Jana 
Pospisilova, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Other players advancing were No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who beat Jo-Anne 
Faull, 6-1 6-4; No. 9 Helen Kelesi of Canada, who beat Czech Regina Rajchrtova, 
6-1, 6-2, and No. 15 Sylvia Hanika of West Germany, who eliminated American 
Shauna Stafford, 6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova, 27, a Czech who has become an Australian citizen, said her legs 
felt heavy and that she was weary during her loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think she won the match, I think I lost it," Mandlikova said. 
"I was tired. I've played four weeks in a row. That's not an excuse. She played 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl and Aaron Krickstein each won in straight sets in the first round of 
the Hamlet Challenge Cup tournament in Jericho, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, seeded first, defeated Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 6-4, 6-2. 
No. 5 Aaron Krickstein beat Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 6-4, 6-3.

Irishman Eoghan O'Connell shot a one-under-par 69 Wednesday to lead a field of 
64 qualifiers into four days of match play for the U.S. Amateur Golf 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old senior at Wake Forest won medal honors for the 36-hole 
qualifying with a 68-69 -- 137, four under par, edging Phil Mickelson, the 1989 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion from Arizona State and San Diego, 
who shot 70-68 -- 138. 
</P>
<P>
Three were tied at 142: John (Tripp) Isenhour (69-73), a Georgia Tech junior; 
Jim Pemberton (73-69), a sophomore at USC, and Chris Patton (71-71), a junior 
from Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Martin of Van Buren, Ohio; John Grace, owner of a real estate company in 
Ft. Worth, and Duke Delcher, a former Philadelphia champion, were next at 143. 
</P>
<P>
The 64 survivors from a field of 312 start match play today with 18 holes at 
historic Merion Golf Club and continue with 36 holes Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The cut came at 149 and a playoff was held to whittle the field to 64. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of prestige," O'Connell said. "There were 312 players here and I 
beat 'em all. That should keep me happy for a month." 
</P>
<P>
This was O'Connell's first look of the 6,523-yard Merion course. 
</P>
<P>
"The back nine is superb," he said. "Sixteen, 17 and 18 are as good a finish as 
you'll get. It's not a very long course, but it has character."

Dan Melendez says it was inevitable that the United States and Cuba met Sunday 
in the championship game of the World Junior Baseball tournament in 
Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what everybody wanted to see, us against Cuba," said the recent St. 
Bernard High graduate. "The Cubans are crazy. They curse at the umpires in 
Spanish and try to intimidate everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Although not as colorful as their opponents, the young Americans proved better 
prepared for the big game. They scored an 11-3 victory, as Melendez collected 
three hits in six at-bats and drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so pumped up, we just took it to them right away," said the first 
baseman, who was chosen most valuable player of the tournament that featured 
junior national teams from 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez hit .500 (12 for 24) with six doubles in seven games but was surprised 
when he was named MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of my biggest thrills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez had more than his share of thrills last spring when he led St. Bernard 
to a 20-6 record and the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 2-A playoffs. 
The 6-foot-4 left-hander posted an 11-3 pitching record, hit .527 and ended his 
prep career with 14 school records. He was named 2-A Player of the Year and The 
Times South Bay Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The junior national team, composed of players ages 16-18, was selected from the 
rosters of the four regional teams at the U.S. Olympic Festival. Melendez, who 
was plucked from the West team, was one of 22 players originally selected. That 
number was reduced to 18 a week before the World Junior tournament began Aug. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez said he didn't hit well during the U.S. team's week of practice in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed after Iowa," he said. "But in the first game (the coaches) 
had me batting third, so they still had confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez didn't let his team down. He went 2 for 2 with a double off the wall 
against Holland, setting the stage for an impressive tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine recruit was one of five Southern Californians on the junior 
national team. The others were infielder Jason Evans and pitcher Derek Wallace 
of Chatsworth, catcher Greg Zaun of La Canada St. Francis and outfielder Chris 
Sheff of Laguna Hills. Sheff, who will join Melendez at Pepperdine, was named 
to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive year that the U.S. defeated Cuba for the title 
after Cuba had won four in a row from 1984 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Standout running back Earl Rhodes, who said last week that he was leaning 
toward transferring to South Pasadena High, said Tuesday he will return for his 
senior year at Coast Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, twice named the Southern Section eight-man Small Division MVP, said his 
family persuaded him to return to Coast Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where positive things happened for me, so (my family) was all for it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 205-pound player said he will make the daily drive from his home in 
Pasadena to Coast Christian, located on Inglewood Avenue in North Redondo 
Beach. Coach Dan Pride, now coaching at Webb in Claremont, had driven Rhodes to 
school for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes said he hopes to start practicing with Coast Christian next week. 
</P>
<P>
Defending L.A. City 4-A champion Carson is again expected to be one of the 
Southland's top football teams, but Coach Gene Vollnogle is concerned about the 
Colts' inexperienced offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Newly Young, a 6-foot, 225-pound senior and the only returning starter on 
the offensive line, is academically ineligible and most likely will not play 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected him to be the mainstay of that line to build on," Vollnogle said. 
"But he didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
All-City fullback Derek Sparks, who transferred from Banning to Montclair Prep 
after last season, has been joined by his cousin at the Van Nuys school. 
</P>
<P>
Leland Sparks, a junior who played with Derek in ninth grade at Wharton High in 
Texas, will start at quarterback for Montclair Prep after transferring last 
spring. He'll be joined in the backfield by Derek, a junior fullback, and 
Michael Jones, a 6-2, 210-pound senior tailback who has turned up on several 
preseason All-American lists. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that Montclair Prep is ranked No. 1 in the CIF-Southern 
Section Division IX preseason poll? 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Carson linebacker Nkosi Littleton was the only South Bay football 
player named to Super Prep magazine's preseason All-American team. Littleton, a 
6-2, 210-pound senior who was an All-City defensive end last year, was rated 
the No. 18 linebacker prospect in the country by Super Prep. Carson wide 
receiver Michael Ross was named to the magazine's All-Far West team . . . 
Armando Fernandez, the hitting star of Hawthorne's baseball team last season as 
a sophomore, is expected to start at fullback for the Cougars' football team. 
The 6-foot, 200-pound junior was named to The Times All-South Bay baseball team 
last spring after hitting .413 with five home runs and 24 RBIs . . . Brett 
Newell, a junior and the son of Coach Steve Newell, will start at quarterback 
for El Segundo's football team. One of the Eagles' top running backs will be 
Garret Quaintance, an All-CIF catcher for El Segundo's Southern Section 2-A 
champion baseball team . . . Antone Williamson, All-CIF third baseman and a 
member of The Times All-South Bay baseball team last year as a sophomore, is 
battling for the starting quarterback job at Torrance.

WORLD SERIES THE LAST STOP ON LONG JOURNEY FOR SAN PEDRO'S FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They sat in the steamy sunshine with faces as red as the San Pedro T-shirts 
they wore. 
</P>
<P>
Some took red-eye flights and others broiled on the highway as they made their 
way to the Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
For parents and supporters of Eastview Little League of San Pedro, this is the 
last stop on a long journey that began 18 games ago, spanning two divisional 
championships and three pressure-packed weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One loss here and a team is out of the running for a championship, so the 100 
or so San Pedro fans who watched Eastview's 14-hit, 12-5 first-round win over 
Tampa, Fla., on Wednesday rooted as it might be their last game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity," said Cheryl Harper. Her son, Tim, 
was the winning pitcher, despite fits of wildness. She would take the victory 
anyway she could get it, said Cheryl. It was a birthday present for Tim, who 
turned 13 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the parents had been looking forward to the finals even before they 
knew San Pedro would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't miss it for the world," said Bill Sulentor, whose son, Joe, plays 
left field and went two for four at the plate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Others agreed: "It's been a little hectic getting here, but it's worth it," 
said Emily Danelo. Her son, Joey, is a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mixed crowd, much as one would expect from a city as ethnically 
diverse as San Pedro. There are stevedores and businessman, housewives and 
working women. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got them all," Bill Sulentor said.." 
</P>
<P>
The common bond isn't really baseball. Baseball is just the vehicle that 
brought them together. The strength of this group, many of whom met five years 
ago when their children entered T-ball, is what league President Gary Miley 
calls the city "at the end." 
</P>
<P>
It is the uniqueness of San Pedro, most of them agreed, that drives them to sit 
and sweat together in the hot Pennsylvania sun that bakes the bleachers of 
Howard J. Lamade Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Us Pedro guys stick together," said Eastview Coach Nick Lusic, a painting 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the community that makes us strong," said Miley, a longshoreman, his 
forehead bedecked with perspiration. "Somebody told me once of San Pedro that 
you either live here, work here, know somebody here or you are lost. It's a 
tight town." 
</P>
<P>
It has been financially difficult for some to attend. Miley has not put in the 
number of hours he is expected to work at the docks, so he expects to be docked 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Sulentor says he'll "be working a few weekends" when he gets back from this 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Lusic has his painting business to worry about and Manager Joe Dileva, an 
insurance agent, has clients to see. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's interest has been there. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the community have really supported us," Lusic said. 
</P>
<P>
Sulentor, a real estate lawyer, pointed to the interest each of the parents has 
in the kids: 
</P>
<P>
"We all know baseball and we all love kids. We have lots of fathers, all 
ex-jocks, and they work with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Harper likes the fact that everyone knows each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere down the line these kids will have all played each other in 
baseball. San Pedro is very close-knit." 
</P>
<P>
So close, in fact, that Frank North flew to New York from San Pedro before 
coming here to pick up his son, Jimmy, who splits time between his father in 
California and his mother in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy goes to school with some of these kids when he is living with me in San 
Pedro," he said. "He wanted to be here." 
</P>
<P>
So close that Elizabeth and Rick Roderick, parents of Victoria Brucker, the 
slugging girl first baseman, found a way to get here when they didn't think 
they could afford it. They drove, with their three children, arriving about an 
hour before game time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So close that Gary Sloan, father of the son by the same name who went two for 
three with a home run against Tampa, fought his fear of flying to get here. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified," he said of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
But he made it. And so have the others. When they sit together, in their red 
shirts, they meld. 
</P>
<P>
There is nowhere else they would like to be right now -- unless it is back home 
in San Pedro where the cool sea breeze can wash away memories of a steamy 
Pennsylvania afternoon.

FANS' PLANE MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jetliner carrying fans and parents of players from Eastview Little League of 
San Pedro to the Little League World Series made an emergency landing in 
Cleveland on Tuesday afternoon because of a pressurization problem in the cargo 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Flight 254, which originated in Los Angeles as Flight 1272, had 
stopped in Cleveland and was en route to Philadelphia when the pilot told 
passengers that he was returning to Cleveland. According to Kris Lusic, wife of 
San Pedro Coach Nick Lusic, about 17 people headed to Williamsport, Pa., to see 
the team's first-round game were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody panicked," Kris Lusic said, although emergency vehicles on the ground 
met the plane upon its return with lights flashing.

DIGEST: CUCCIA TAKES HELM AT POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Cuccia officially was installed Wednesday as the new football coach at 
Poly High. He replaces Kevin Kennedy, who resigned last week after three years 
as coach to become an assistant at L. A. Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia, who formerly coached at La Puente, Hoover and South Pasadena highs, met 
with the Poly players for the first time Wednesday and introduced John Alaimo 
as an assistant coach. Alaimo, 22, played quarterback for Cuccia at Hoover and 
will serve as a walk-on coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia was recommended for the job by Athletic Director George Tideback last 
week and gained the approval of Principal Virginia Holt on Tuesday. He was 
officially hired Wednesday by the L. A. Unified School District and will teach 
either English or physical education. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Usher of Calabasas shot a two-over-par 38 Wednesday to win the 
11-and-under division of the La Purisima Junior Invitational in Lompoc by 13 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Usher, 11, the 1989 L.A. City Champion in his division, has won 24 of 36 
tournaments he has competed in this year. He placed second in seven others and 
third twice. Last year, he was selected Southern California Golfer of the Year 
in his division by the Southern California Junior Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Kirksey, the Camarillo High tailback who rushed for 670 yards in six games 
last season as a sophomore, said that there is an "85% chance" he would be in 
the Scorpions' backfield when the season opens Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey tore a ligament in his right knee and subsequently missed Camarillo's 
final five games. He spent the summer in rehabilitation but has yet to practice 
with the team. A brace designed to stabilize his knee is expected to arrive 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel stronger in both legs than I ever have before," Kirksey said. "I'm in 
great health right now." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the knee will stand up to the rigors of Camarillo's running game 
remains a question, but Kirksey's desire to play does not. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally," he said, "I'm looking forward to playing this season more than I 
ever have before." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, heeding doctors' advice, opted against surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Former Poly High standout Craig Ellis caught two touchdown passes Wednesday 
night, leading the Edmonton Eskimos to a 37-14 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 
in a match-up of Canadian Football League division leaders in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Wright, an All-Western Football Conference selection with Cal State 
Northridge in 1987, led Edmonton (6-1) with four catches for 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis has 34 receptions this season, tying him for third in the CFL with 
Toronto's Darrell K. Smith.

GILBERT ALWAYS KNEW WHICH GAMBIT TO USE AGAINST PEPPERDINE FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Farmer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Gilbert is blazing hot. He recently won three consecutive professional 
tennis tournaments -- a feat last accomplished by Boris Becker in 1986 -- and 
reached the final of a fourth. He is ranked No. 8 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has Gilbert remained unaffected by success, friends say, but he is 
still the first to criticize his own game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very unassuming," said Allen Fox, a Calabasas resident and co-coach at 
Pepperdine. Gilbert played for the Waves during the 1983 season before turning 
pro. "If he had a bad game, he would say, 'I served like a 14-year-old. I 
couldn't hit a backhand in the court.' He would never say how good he is." 
</P>
<P>
Nor would he praise competitors. In fact, the good-natured Gilbert often mocked 
opponents, criticizing their abilities, to bolster teammates. Before a match, 
each Pepperdine player would receive his assignment from Fox and some 
unsolicited advice from Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad was so confident, he would ruin the other guys," said Fox, who laughs now 
but wasn't amused by Gilbert's comments at the time. "He would say, 'You're 
playing him. He's horrible. Can't hit his forehand in the court. Hit three or 
four balls back to him and he'll miss.' " 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gallien, who played No. 3 at Pepperdine while Gilbert played No. 2 and 
is now co-coach with Fox, says Gilbert would invariably follow through on his 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single match, he was like Minnesota Fats," said Gallien, who lives in 
Canoga Park. "He'd tell you all the shots he was going to make and give you 
some idea of the score. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a guy who would believe it the way he did and come through 
like he would." 
</P>
<P>
Once, while warming up for a doubles match against USC, Gilbert sniffed 
overconfidence in his opponents. "You could just tell by the way (the USC 
players) were warming up," Fox recalled. "The way they were flipping their 
rackets. Twirling them." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be upstaged by the upstart pair, Gilbert, a right-hander, warmed up with 
his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously demeaning when you start hitting left-handed with somebody," 
Fox said. "Brad wasn't too interested in his opponents. He wasn't deliberately 
mean to them but if somebody tried to intimidate him or was cocky to him, he 
wouldn't take it lying down. He would always react." 
</P>
<P>
Fox is quick to add that Gilbert has a soft side. Once, Gilbert came back to 
Pepperdine after he had joined the pro tour and stayed in an off-campus 
apartment with some friends. Upon departure, he stocked the cupboards with new 
pots, pans, dishes and silverware. 
</P>
<P>
"No tennis players do that," Fox said. "You're lucky if they say 'goodby' on 
the way out the door after they've emptied your refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
Deja vu reprised: Simi Valley High has hired Rick Fields, the girls' junior 
varsity basketball coach, to coach the girls' tennis team. The Pioneers were 
14-6 last year and placed third in the Marmonte League but lost their top two 
players when twins Jeannette and Jamie Davis graduated. Jeannette was the 
league champion. 
</P>
<P>
But Fields will replace those two with another set of twins: sophomores 
Michelle and Lisa Richards. Michelle is ranked third in Ventura County in the 
under-16 division by the Southern California Tennis Assn. and Lisa is ranked 
fourth along with Lisa Cockerill, another Simi Valley sophomore. All three are 
ranked in the top 50 in their age group in Southern California.

ENCINO WINS, GETS REMATCH WITH SEOUL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Ferebee struck out nine and Steve Chavez hit a two-run home run Wednesday 
as Encino defeated Orland Park, Ill., 7-3, to advance in the Pony League World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Encino must defeat Seoul tonight and again Friday to win the championship. 
Seoul defeated Encino, 4-0, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's third-inning home run scored Glen Carson and gave Encino a 3-2 lead. 
Orland Park, which committed seven errors, made three in the third, allowing 
two more runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing, 2-0, in the first, Encino's Justin Paperny singled to 
drive in Cesar Martinez, who had doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Orland Park scored a run in the fourth and Encino countered with two insurance 
runs in the sixth on Kevin Deitch's double and an RBI single by Jesus Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no official significance attached to the win, Encino Coach 
P.C. Shaw considers it tantamount to the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get outclassed by anybody," Shaw said. "Check the record -- Encino 
just won the United States."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS TESTED BY AIR FORCE IMPERSONATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In preparation for its football season opener against Air Force Sept. 2, San 
Diego State went through a full-contact "game" Wednesday against the scout 
team, which was running the Falcons' plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ragged," Coach Al Luginbill said. "Fortunately, we don't have to play 
a game until a week from Saturday. Our scout team gives us a heck of a look. 
It's great for our defense. Our men have to get used to going against a good, 
solid scout team, and that has not been the history of this program." 
</P>
<P>
The scout team ran Air Force's best plays with the Aztec defense in its weakest 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to put ourselves in vulnerable situations," said Barry Lamb, 
defensive coordinator. "The cards were marked a little, but better that than to 
make it easy." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Steve Matuszewicz (bruised knee) and running back Kip Jeffries 
(sprained ankle) were injured in Wednesday's early practice. Receiver Patrick 
Rowe (knee) did not participate but has been practicing since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
GOLF 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mickelson of San Diego shot a two-under-par 68 and finished a shot behind 
medalist Eoghan O'Connell of Ireland at the U.S. Amateur Golf Championships at 
Ardmore, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The field of 312 was cut to 64 for match play after 36 holes of medalist play. 
Mickelson, who will be a sophomore at Arizona State, finished with a 138. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Michals of Vista (161) and Mike Levy of Escondido (166) did not make the 
cut of 149. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Riley of San Diego shot his second consecutive 77 and is 10 shots behind 
the co-leaders after the second round of the PGA Junior Championship at the PGA 
National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Two Floridians -- Bobby Collins 
of Atlantis and Briny Baird of Miami Beach -- lead at par 144. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' tournament, Leta Lindley of Carlsbad was nine shots behind the 
leader with a two-round total of 158. Vicki Goetze of Hull, Ga., leads with a 
149.

GOLDSMITH FINDS FRENCH BUYER FOR FARMERS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British financier Sir James Goldsmith said Wednesday that his investment group 
will sell Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Inc. to a French insurance concern if 
he succeeds in his hostile bid to buy Farmers' current parent, BAT Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith said Hoylake Investments Limited, which he formed with other 
investors to make a $21.7-billion bid for London-based BAT, reached a 
conditional agreement under which Axa Midi Assurances would buy Farmers for 
$4.5 billion. Paris-based Axa Midi, which owns a very small reinsurance company 
in the United States, would also invest about $952 million (600 million pounds) 
in Hoylake, Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a 'Fit Parent' 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, Hoylake is trying to persuade state insurance 
regulators not to veto the sale of BAT. But in London, BAT Chairman Patrick 
Sheehy said Hoylake was selling out BAT shareholders. "Hoylake is proposing to 
sell Farmers Group on the cheap in a forced sale. BAT Industries shareholders 
would be deprived of its real value and future potential," Sheehy said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and automobile insurer, reluctantly 
became a part of the BAT family last December. Farmers agreed to be acquired 
after a bitter, 9-month campaign and only after it forced Batus Inc. -- BAT's 
American unit based in Louisville, Ky. -- to raise its bid to $5.2 billion from 
$4.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout that battle, opponents of the merger insisted that Batus, which owns 
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. as well as the Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Marshall Fields department stores, was not a fit parent for an insurance 
concern. They argued, for example, that Batus might force Farmers to end 
discounts for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith and Hoylake officials renewed those charges Wednesday in their 
campaign to persuade state regulators that Hoylake is a responsible guardian 
that has found a suitable parent for Farmers. Under British law, Hoylake must 
show by Oct. 28 that there are no hurdles to its acquiring BAT. Standing in its 
way are the insurance regulators in nine American states who have the authority 
to assess whether the acquisition by Hoylake is in the public interest. Hoylake 
has challenged the regulators' authority in federal court, arguing that the 
reviews are improper because the entire transaction is taking place in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Trust 
</P>
<P>
The consortium is nevertheless willing to work with the states, Samuel Pisar, 
Goldsmith's chief counsel, said in an interview Wednesday. But given the months 
that insurance regulators took to review BAT's bid for Farmers, it is not 
likely that they would act in time to meet the British deadline, he said. Pisar 
said the question of Hoylake's fitness to operate an insurance company is moot 
given its announcement. "As of this morning, there has been a sea change. We 
have turned BAT's argument on its head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pisar said that Goldsmith never intended to operate an insurance company. "Now 
that the buyers are known, it has to be reassuring to all of the (state 
insurance) commissioners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hoylake sought to diffuse the issue by setting up a voting trust to 
take charge of Farmers until it could find a buyer. Hoylake said the trustees 
-- former U.S. Sen. Daniel J. Evans (R-Wash.), Los Angeles attorney Shirley M. 
Hufstedler and David Sherwood, former president of Prudential Insurance of 
America -- would have the power to sell Farmers on their own if Hoylake had not 
found a buyer by a certain period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith said in a statement that Axa Midi is "an ideal business partner for 
Farmers." He said: "We have demonstrated our resolve to sell Farmers as quickly 
as possible to a company of impeccable credentials. . . . Which is the better 
custodian of Farmers? A sprawling tobacco based conglomerate -- with its 
inherent conflicts of interest -- or a successful and growing insurance group." 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi's history dates back some 200 years, but the current entity came into 
being as a result of hostile merger attempt. Compagnie Du Midi formed an 
alliance in 1988 with the Axa insurance group in an attempt to block a takeover 
by Italian insurance company Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. Subsequently, Axa 
won control of Compagnie du Midi, forcing out its chairman. Meanwhile, Generali 
persisted in efforts to form a relationship with Axa and now has about a 20% 
stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Over Farmers' Fate 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi owns five insurance concerns in Canada but has only a small presence 
in the United States through its Gamma Reinsurance Co. of New York. Although 
Gamma is licensed in 43 states, including California, its influence is 
"negligible," said an Axa Midi spokeswoman. If Hoylake's scenario is 
successful, the merger would guarantee Axa Midi "a significant position" in the 
American market, Axa Midi said in a statement. Farmers is the nation's 
15th-largest insurance concern. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, BAT formally defended its rejection of Hoylake's offer, saying that 
the bid is nothing more than an attempt to break up a "successful company for 
the personal gain of a group of extremely wealthy people." Pisar said BAT 
deserved to be broken up because it has moved far beyond its expertise in the 
tobacco business, "often making a mess" of companies it acquired. "Had BAT 
stayed a tobacco company, it would be like Philip Morris today.

TIME WARNER DETAILS PLANS TO PAY FOR TAKEOVER; 
</P>
<P>
$12-BILLION DEBT LOAD IS LOWER THAN SOME ANALYSTS EXPECTED

Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that it will pay for the second half of its 
$14-billion acquisition of Warner Communications with three kinds of 
securities, leaving the newly formed entertainment giant with a debt load of 
about $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner, which defeated a Paramount takeover bid for Warner July 24, will 
buy the outstanding 41% of Warner stock with a combination of convertible 
preferred stock, payment-in-kind preferred stock and common stock in the BHC 
Communications broadcast holding company. Payment-in-kind securities pay their 
interest in shares of the same security rather than in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the package was valued by the company at $70 a share, although some 
analysts predicted it would initially trade somewhat below that figure. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Time Warner Co-Chairmen J. Richard Munro and Steven J. Ross 
said the company had "designed an overall financial structure that will allow 
us to build our businesses, capitalize on new opportunities and challenges 
worldwide, and ensure growing value for our shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back End' of Deal Was Key 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner paid about $7 billion in cash for the first 100 million Warner 
shares; it will purchase 86.8 million shares in this latest transaction, which 
was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The merger will be 
formally completed in the fourth quarter, Time Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the "back end" of the transaction was a delicate issue for 
the new company. Time Warner needed to satisfy Warner shareholders without too 
greatly diluting the value of Time shares. It also needed to preserve enough 
cash to keep the new company viable. 
</P>
<P>
The company's new debt load of about $12 billion compares favorably to the $14 
billion or $15 billion that some analysts had been expecting during the 
takeover fight. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided not to send all the cash out the door. That should make it a more 
dynamic company," said Jeffrey Logsdon, analyst with the investment firm of 
Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
J. Kendrick Noble, analyst with the Paine Webber brokerage in New York, 
predicted that investors "will look favorably on this." Jeffrey Russell, 
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the investment firm took the view 
that the offer "is good for shareholders but leaves the company with the 
flexibility it needs." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Chris-Craft Industries, a large Warner shareholder and often its 
sharpest critic, could not immediately be reached for comment. BHC 
Communications is a broadcast television and cable TV concern that has been 
jointly owned by Warner and Chris-Craft. 
</P>
<P>
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time Warner shares closed 
Wednesday at $141.75, up $2.125. Warner shares ended the day at $65.375, off 
$1.625.

TRW TO REORGANIZE SPACE, DEFENSE SECTOR AS PENTAGON SPENDING FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRW announced Wednesday a major reorganization of its space and defense sector 
in Redondo Beach, responding to the dismal outlook for Pentagon budgets and a 
company goal to increase its market share. 
</P>
<P>
TRW Executive Vice President Edsel Dunford, who heads the 27,500-worker sector, 
said the realignment will not result in any loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 of the sector's workers were laid off last year, and another 1,800 
jobs were eliminated through attrition, but Dunford said the employment 
situation has stabilized and the operation is now adding workers in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
TRW, based in Cleveland, hopes that the reorganization will position its 
resources more efficiently in an era when defense markets will be shrinking and 
competition for contracts is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are growing rapidly, you add a lot of new capability," Dunford said. 
"In a tougher market, you want to make sure you use those capabilities in the 
best way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Related' to Performance 
</P>
<P>
He said TRW became the nation's 18th-largest defense contractor in 1988, up 
from 21st the year before, indicating that the company had gained market share. 
Meanwhile, its ranking in space agency contracting and in research contracting 
was unchanged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunford said the reorganization announced Wednesday was not related to weak 
profit performance or to problems with any of the firm's programs. TRW's space 
and defense business suffered a 12% decline in operating profit for 1988, even 
though sales rose 2% to $3.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Dunford called the decline an "anomaly" and "not a systemic decline of 
profits." He blamed it on costs related to development under a fixed-price 
contract of a classified communications system. 
</P>
<P>
TRW moved out of 23 leased buildings during 1988 in an effort to reduce its 
costs and increased the density of workers in company-owned buildings, Dunford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Federal Funding 
</P>
<P>
Separately, TRW faces a number of risks in the coming congressional conference 
on the defense authorization bill. The House of Representatives has voted to 
kill the $22-billion Milstar communications satellite program in which TRW is a 
major subcontractor to Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have quite a few hundred people working on Milstar, and it would mean 
phasing those people out," he said about a contract cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Also, reducing federal funding has slowed down TRW's program to build the 
orbital maneuvering vehicle, a type of tow truck for satellites. And its 
advanced X-ray observatory spacecraft is having a slow start while the 
feasibility of its mirror system is tested, he said. A third TRW spacecraft, 
the gamma-ray observatory, is ready for shipment to Florida for launch in the 
second quarter of next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under its reorganization, TRW's space and defense sector will be composed of 
four realigned groups of roughly equal size, focusing on spacecraft, space 
electronics, other military electronic equipment and software. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consolidate Work 
</P>
<P>
The company also shifted the headquarters of one of the groups from Redondo 
Beach to Fairfax, Va., and that of another from Sunnyvale to suburban San 
Diego. Dunford said the company's primary growth will take place in Fairfax and 
that the company does not plan to add a significant number of jobs at its Space 
Park location in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The new Systems Integration Group will consolidate TRW's extensive work in the 
field of putting hardware and software together in complex systems. TRW also 
combined its spacecraft production group with its ballistic missile division, 
which is the Air Force's engineering adviser on all U.S. land-based strategic 
nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
It also named Donald L. Jacobs, former chief of its Defense Systems Division, 
to vice president and deputy general manager in the new sector executive office 
to improve "internal processes and procedures."

Arco Wins Oil Tanker Decision: A federal appellate court upheld the right of 
the U.S. Transportation Department to allow two oil tankers owned by Atlantic 
Richfield Co. to continue delivering Alaskan oil to the lower 48 states, Arco 
announced. The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
came in a lawsuit by independent tanker owners against the DOT challenging the 
use of tankers built with U.S. subsidies and intended for foreign service only. 
Such ships are normally barred from domestic service, but two Arco tankers were 
allowed to sail in the United States after Arco repaid about $87 million in 
subsidies used to build them.

BAY AREA COUPLE FASHION CEDAR 'HOMES' FOR LETTERS; 
</P>
<P>
MAILBOXES FOR ALL TASTES, EVEN POST-MODERN

<P>
In an area where few can afford a home, Melody Cole's houses are selling faster 
than she can slap on the shutters. 
</P>
<P>
They're made of cedar and come with flowered wallpaper, plush carpeting, lace 
curtains and a roof with shingles. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't live in them -- they're mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's sort of like the American Dream," said Cole who, along with her 
husband Jim, owns Mail Mansions in nearby Belmont. "It's taking a practical, 
plain item that is usually not paid attention to . . . and making it into 
something more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another little embellishment that makes a house a home." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Cole quit her job as an office manager to devote herself full 
time to Mail Mansions. 
</P>
<P>
Working furiously in her garage-turned-workshop, Cole made about 500 mailbox 
houses last year, worth $30,000 in gross sales to the small company. 
</P>
<P>
Although her husband does the heavy sawing and cutting, Cole assembles the 
parts and does all the sanding, painting and finishing work. 
</P>
<P>
To make the mailboxes as authentic as possible, Cole paints flowers along the 
borders and inserts real glass in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"You think of a big house, well, this is just a little house," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The mail is inserted through the house's door, which has a tiny ceramic 
doorknob and opens with a cuckoo clock hinge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Touches 
</P>
<P>
The mailboxes come in five styles -- cottage, Victorian, barn, bungalow and 
cabin -- but Cole personalizes them by matching paint, carpet and wallpaper to 
the buyer's home. 
</P>
<P>
For some customers, however, that's not enough. One ham radio aficionado asked 
Cole to add a tiny antenna on top of his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Another had a miniature light installed inside to match the lights in his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
When Heidi Maslen added a bay window to the front of her San Mateo house, she 
wanted a mailbox to match. She ordered a Victorian-style mailbox and brought 
her blue-gray house paint along to guarantee an exact copy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just so cute," Maslen said. "They're so different from the standard 
black mailbox that you always see." 
</P>
<P>
Since Cole has a bachelor's degree in theater arts from San Francisco State 
University, she knows how to make a flat surface appear three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
By sponge-blotting the wood red or gray, Cole can make the mailboxes look like 
they're made of brick or flagstone. She then simply paints on the mortar. 
</P>
<P>
Each mailbox takes about 12 hours to do, Cole said. They range from $45 to 
$165. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the money that drives Cole. She said she enjoys making something 
that is such a part of a person's daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that you visit every day," she said. "If you think about it, 
you don't have that many things that you have such regular contact with as your 
mailbox."

BRITISH REPORT 2ND-WORST TRADE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's trade picture took a severe turn for the worse last month when its 
balance of payments showed a massive deficit of $3.25 billion (2.06 billion 
pounds), the second-worst monthly figure ever, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit compared to a shortfall of $2.5 billion (1.5 billion pounds) in 
June, and its size surprised economic analysts who had forecast an improvement 
in the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
The report was a blow to government hopes that the figure, which measures trade 
in goods and services, had taken a decisive downturn as a result of government 
policy of pushing interest rates higher to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said the deficit on trade alone was $3.9 billion 
(2.46 billion pounds), but this was offset by a surplus of $630 million (400 
million pounds) on invisible items such as banking, insurance and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly large deficit sent the British pound tumbling. It slid more 
than 1.5 cents to $1.5720 from $1.5895 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Single Reason 
</P>
<P>
Britain recorded its worst current account deficit of $3.7 billion (2.33 
billion pounds) last October as a runaway consumer boom, which is only now 
beginning to wind down, sucked in imports. 
</P>
<P>
Although Britain's seaborne trade was affected by a three-week dock strike in 
July, the government said there was no single reason for the jump in the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Imports increased by 4%, while exports rose 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Imports in July included an influx of cars ready for the start of the new 
registration year in August, when sales reach their annual peak. 
</P>
<P>
The bad July trade figures countered more encouraging recent economic reports, 
including the first fall in inflation since the start of 1988 and a halt to 
growth in pay rises. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel 
Lawson, was less likely to cut interest rates from 14% despite pressure from 
businessmen who fear that the economy risks moving into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates could push sterling down further against the dollar and 
the West German mark and give a fresh twist to inflation.

VAN DE KAMP'S APPEAL COULD SUCCEED, O'CONNOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp would have "a fair prospect" of 
winning his U.S. Supreme Court appeal against American Stores' planned merger 
of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains, according to a non-binding 
opinion by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
In the seven-page document, disclosed Wednesday, O'Connor also said there is a 
"reasonable probability" that at least four justices -- the required number -- 
would approve a review of the antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court observers said such wording is standard when a High Court justice 
decides to grant an emergency request for relief based on the merits of a case. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who responds to requests involving cases of the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in San Francisco, issued the informal opinion to explain her 
decision the day before to grant Van de Kamp's emergency request to continue to 
bar the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the appeals court cleared the way for combining the chains. The 
decision led to Van de Kamp's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Requests Denied 
</P>
<P>
One attorney noted that most emergency requests are denied, making it 
significant that O'Connor agreed. But it is not unusual for the justices 
subsequently to refuse to review a case. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also clarified her order, noting that it was conditioned on the 
posting by Van de Kamp of a "good and sufficient bond," the size of which is to 
be determined by the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, District Judge David Kenyon ordered Van de Kamp to post a 
$16.3-million bond if he wanted to pursue the appeal, to cover potential losses 
at American Stores. Van de Kamp appealed, saying he should be exempt from 
posting a bond because he was suing on behalf of consumers. Van de Kamp has 
vowed to forgo the Supreme Court appeal rather than post a bond. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the appeal appears to hinge on whether he would reverse himself in 
light of O'Connor's encouraging statements. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, Andrea Sheridan Ordin, chief assistant attorney 
general, said: "We are pleased that Justice O'Connor believes that there is a 
reasonable probability that the Supreme Court will vote to hear our petition 
but are disappointed that the justice has returned the case to the District 
Court to set a bond." 
</P>
<P>
Ordin added that the attorney general's office intends to file papers today in 
response to the order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intriguing Conflict 
</P>
<P>
In her opinion, O'Connor said she agreed with the lower courts' findings that 
the California attorney general "has made an adequate showing of irreparable 
injury" to consumers should the merger go through. Van de Kamp has argued that 
the merger would lessen competition and result in higher food prices. 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the case poses an intriguing conflict among various federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court had ruled that Van de Kamp could not, under federal 
antitrust laws, directly or indirectly force American Stores to sell stores. 
O'Connor noted that other courts have disagreed, saying that divestiture is a 
remedy available "in appropriate circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
"Given the conflict . . . and the need for uniform enforcement of federal 
antitrust laws, I think it fair to say that there is a reasonable probability 
that the petition for a writ of certiorari will be granted in this case," 
O'Connor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Delays 
</P>
<P>
A petition for a writ of certiorari is a request for review. The Supreme Court, 
now in recess, is scheduled to reconvene Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, paid $2.5 billion for Lucky Stores of 
Dublin, Calif., in June, 1988. At the time, it said it planned to integrate its 
Alpha Beta operation with Lucky to reap savings in advertising, distribution 
and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, legal delays stemming from Van de Kamp's challenge have 
prevented American Stores from putting the chains together. The company 
estimates that the delays are costing $1.5 million a week, not including legal 
fees.

British Trade Deficit Grows: Britain's trade picture took a severe turn for the 
worse last month when its balance of payments showed a deficit of $3.25 billion 
(2.06 billion pounds), the second-worst monthly figure ever. The deficit 
compared to a shortfall of $2.5 billion (1.5 billion pounds) in June, and its 
size surprised economic analysts who had forecast an improvement. The 
government, which said there was no one reason for the jump, had hoped that its 
policy of pushing interest rates higher to cool the economy would have helped 
the trade figures.

Napa Valley Train Gets Nod: The California Public Utilities Commission gave its 
unanimous approval to a settlement that will allow the Napa Valley Wine Train 
to start passenger service through the famed wine valley in about three weeks. 
NVWT President Jack McCormack immediately announced that service between Napa 
and St. Helena will start Sept. 15, with twice-daily service Tuesday, Wednesday 
and Thursday, and three times on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The interim 
operations will not affect two court actions to be heard this year in San 
Francisco and Washington on which agency has the authority to regulate the 
train -- the PUC or the federal Interstate Commerce Commission.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: LET THE COMPUTER DO YOUR DIALING

The recent strike at Pacific Bell and other regional phone companies made it 
very difficult to reach directory assistance in many areas of the country. In 
my case, it wasn't a major problem because I have my own "directory assistance" 
on both my IBM compatible computer and my Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
A number of programs allow you to look up telephone numbers, addresses and, in 
some cases, fax numbers of businesses and government institutions throughout 
the country. Hot Line Two, PC Yellow Pages and the Fortune 500 Prospector can 
be used on IBM and compatible machines. Macintosh users, whose units can be 
equipped with a compact disc drive, have access to information from more than 
110,000 companies via the National Directory of Addresses and Telephone 
Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A compact disc drive is an optional add-on device using discs similar to those 
in audio systems that, unlike regular disk drives, can only be used to retrieve 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Line Two, published by General Information Inc., is a telephone dialing 
program that comes on disks with a directory of phone numbers and addresses for 
more than 10,000 companies, government agencies, universities and other medium 
to large organizations. Hot Line Two can also be used for your personal 
directory; it stores up to 64,000 listings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
InfoPacks Focus on Specific Industries 
</P>
<P>
The program can be used even while your computer is running other programs. 
Locating a company through a search takes a couple of seconds at most. Once the 
program finds the number, the user presses a key to have the program dial the 
phone, if your computer is equipped with a modem. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether you use the national listings, Hot Line is a handy phone 
management program. It allows you to automatically dial the lengthy access 
codes that some long-distance companies require and is able to dial numbers 
directly off the PC screen, even if they are stored elsewhere such as in a word 
processing or database management program. It can also keep a record of 
outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the basic directory, General Information sells special sets of 
disks, called InfoPacks, that focus on particular industries. InfoPacks are 
available for advertising/public relations/media, colleges and universities, 
computer/high tech, finance, travel and the Department of Defense. The company 
also publishes a disk with 14,000 toll-free numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Line Two stores its data in the same format as Ashton-Tate's best-selling 
database program, dBase III. In addition to using Hot Line Two to dial the 
phone, you can use its data files with dBase or any of the many programs that 
read dBase files. That would be handy for those who want to use the data for 
mass mailings. 
</P>
<P>
The data from Hot Line Two and the various InfoPacks is excerpted from General 
Information's National Directory, a printed book that contains information on 
more than 110,000 businesses and organizations. The printed version is 
available for $54, which includes shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Line Two sells for $99.95 from General Information Inc., 401 Park Place, 
Suite 305, Kirkland, Wash. 98033. Phone (800) 722-3244. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Line Two runs only on IBM compatibles, but Mac users with a compact disc 
drive can get the National Directory of Addresses and Telephone Numbers. The 
data comes from General Information, but the compact disc and Macintosh 
software is a product of Xiphias, a Marina del Rey company that specializes in 
entertainment and business software for the compact disc market. Like Hot Line 
Two, the software that comes with Xiphias' version of the National Directory 
can be used to dial the phone once it has located a number. 
</P>
<P>
Because the directory is stored on compact disc, there isn't the same space 
limitation as on a floppy disk-based product. In addition to more than 110,000 
phone numbers and addresses, it includes fax numbers from about 80,000 
companies, according to Xiphias President Peter Black. The fax numbers, 
according to Black, can be accessed by the software that controls a Macintosh's 
fax modem, making it possible to generate and send your own mass fax mailings. 
</P>
<P>
Listings can be selected by name, location or type of organization. That makes 
it possible to use the data to create customized phone or mailing lists. The 
program can print mailing labels or save data in a format that can be moved to 
virtually any database management, spreadsheet program or some word processing 
systems on the Mac, IBM PC or any other computer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Select by Type, Address 
</P>
<P>
The compact disc has a suggested retail price of $195, but some dealers will 
sell it as part of a $245 three-disc package that also includes two discs from 
other companies. Xiphias can be reached at 13464 Washington Blvd., Marina del 
Rey, Calif. 90292. Phone (213) 821-0074. 
</P>
<P>
Digital Publications of Norcross, Ga., sells several disc-based databases for 
personal computers. One of its products, PC Yellow Pages, features a database 
of toll-free phone numbers from 10,000 U.S. businesses as well as an additional 
customized list of 5,000 companies from your area with address and phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Firms can be selected by name or type of business. The program, which sells for 
$129.99, also offers a database of Fortune 1,000 companies with addresses and 
names of chief executives. Like Hot Line Two, the program is able to dial the 
phone and accept additional listings. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sells specialized directories designed for people who want to 
send advertisements or press releases via direct mail. The PC Press Assistant 
($695) includes addresses for 5,000 trade magazines, newspapers, television and 
radio stations. Magazine listings include the type and size of the publication 
along with the name of the news editor. In many cases, it also includes fax 
numbers. It is compatible with Quadram's JT Fax board, making it possible to 
automatically fax press releases to editors. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sells listings of wholesalers and manufacturers as well as 
customized mailing lists for particular regions of the country. Digital 
Publications can be reached at 5390 Peachtree Industrial Blvd., Norcross, GA 
30071. Phone (404) 448-6881 or (800) 777-1470. 
</P>
<P>
MZ Group, in cooperation with Fortune magazine, has published the Fortune 500 
Prospector. Far more than a directory, the program and accompanying database 
allow you to identify key executives, sales information, profitability, assets, 
earnings and other information from both the Fortune 500 and the Service 500. 
Also included for each company are name, address, phone number, stock symbol, 
exchange, fiscal year end, industry classification and a brief description. 
</P>
<P>
The program allows you to enter personal information on companies, including 
the names of contacts and company-specific tracking information such as 
follow-up dates or other notes. There are also three custom fields and a field 
for free-form notes. You can also add new companies to the database. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which sells for $299, is available from MZ Group, 1388 Sutter St., 
Suite 612, San Francisco, Calif. 94109. Phone (800) 345-9111.

Overall sales of North American-made vehicles advanced 2.6% in mid-August 
compared to a year ago, with incentives and end-of-the-model-year specials 
spurring car sales while truck sales dropped, manufacturers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the buyer interest in cars also may have been prompted by announcements 
of higher prices in the 1990 model year, which officially begins Oct. 1. 
Several 1990 models are in showrooms now. 
</P>
<P>
The eight major U.S.-based auto makers sold an average of 34,290 cars and 
trucks a day during the Aug. 11-20 period this year, compared to a rate of 
33,409 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales were up 5.4% and truck sales were down 2.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"The two big leading (economic) indicators, that being unemployment and 
interest rates, don't seem to have softened," said analyst Paul Kleinaitis of 
Duff &amp; Phelps of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"So given that, and given the fact that price increases are due for the Big 
Three, maybe buyers were accelerated into purchasing now rather than in the new 
model year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Borrowing Sales' 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have announced average 
car price increases of 3.4%, 4.8% and 5%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the uptick we had in July (sales) was partly an increase in consumer 
awareness of a price increase," said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors 
Service Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"But the incentives got richer and the combinations make some deals too good to 
resist for some people," she said. "Right now, we're borrowing sales from the 
fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Higher sales in mid-August slowed the downward trend in car and truck sales 
this year, compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Through last Sunday, companies said, 1989 vehicle sales averaged 37,908 a day, 
down 3.3% from the 39,222 vehicle-a-day rate during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM said its cars sold at a daily rate of 9,752 in the mid-August period, down 
0.7% from the same period last year. For the year to date, GM sales were down 
8.3%.

TRITON GROUP WILL BUY 51% OF LIQUOR BARN 
</P>

Triton Group of La Jolla is joining two San Diego investors to acquire 
substantially all the assets of the bankrupt Liquor Barn retail chain for $40 
million. The prospective owners also said Wednesday that they plan a 
significant expansion of the chain, believed to be the largest liquor retail 
operation in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The two businessmen, Harvey Rosen of Rancho Santa Fe and Lewis Silverberg of 
San Diego, announced last week that they planned to buy the 68-store, San 
Leandro-based chain, and that they were looking for an equity partner. 
</P>
<P>
Triton Group, a publicly owned, diversified holding company, will provide up to 
$8 million cash for the purchase, taking a 51% ownership stake in the chain, 
Triton Vice President Mitchell Woodbury said. Silverberg, Rosen and other 
Liquor Barn managers will invest $2 million or more in cash with the remainder 
of the purchase cost to be raised from bank and bond financing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Barn has been under protection of a U.S. bankruptcy court in Oakland 
since last November. Even after the proceeds from the sale of assets, Liquor 
Barn creditors may end up taking a "haircut in the $40-million range," Woodbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to High Volume 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Barn ran into problems after London-based Majestic Wine Warehouse 
acquired it from Safeway Stores in 1987 in a highly leveraged deal estimated at 
$110 million. Majestic closed many locations and unsuccessfully switched from a 
high-volume, discount operation to a "boutique approach" featuring a smaller, 
higher-priced selection. 
</P>
<P>
Losses resulted last year in Majestic losing control of Liquor Barn to American 
and British banks who acquired 66% interest in the chain. 
</P>
<P>
Sales are running at a rate of about $200 million a year, Woodbury said, down 
from the $332 million revenue peak in 1986 when the chain consisted of 104 
stores, all in California. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen said the new owners plan to bring back the high-volume approach and to 
expand the chain particularly in Southern California, where 33 stores are 
situated. "We could easily double the stores in Southern California alone," 
Rosen said, declining to give a timetable for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, 52, will be Liquor Barn's chief executive, and Silverberg, 54, will be 
general counsel.

The Agriculture Department on Friday will begin notifying 13,000 farmers that 
they must seek to restructure overdue loans or face foreclosure, department 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The notices will be sent to farmers who since January have been delinquent 
repaying government loans, many of which were made in the early 1980s under a 
special program for farmers unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
The loans have since become a massive burden to farmers and the government, and 
about half are delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an annual sort of thing. However, we would expect the 
numbers to reduce as we clean up the portfolio," said Keith Smalley of the 
Farmers Home Administration.

KODAK ANNOUNCES PLANS TO ELIMINATE 4,500 JOBS

<P>
Disappointing second-quarter sales prompted Eastman Kodak Co. to announce a 
reorganization plan Wednesday that will trim 4,500 jobs worldwide this year. 
</P>
<P>
The photo company acknowledged that the cuts were 3,500 jobs above what had 
been previously forecast. Kodak employs 145,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak will also restructure or divest businesses with annual revenues of $1.25 
billion through sale, closure or reorganization and implement "substantial 
reductions in operating costs." 
</P>
<P>
Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said the company wouldn't reveal which units would 
be affected, but some have speculated that its Information Systems business 
segment, which includes copiers, microfilm and graphics equipment, might be 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Decade 
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter of 1989, that segment posted a $144-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the moves are being made to raise $1 billion in operating cash 
during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Allen could not provide specifics on where the jobs would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Colby H. Chandler, the company's chairman and chief executive, said, "We have 
dealt with adversity in the past, but never with such broad-based intensity. 
These uncharacteristic actions are being carried out with great resolve by the 
entire management team." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a tough decade for the photography industry giant, which had turned 
around a sagging bottom line twice in the 1980s, only to see the same problems 
-- increased competition, a rising U.S. dollar and higher costs -- return to 
eat away at profits. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers were laid off in 1983, and in 1986, 10,000 more were laid 
off. In both instances, profits rose substantially the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it would put "increasing emphasis on incentive 
compensation and benefits by placing at risk up to 40% of annual management 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
And in Rochester, where the company's headquarters and several plants are 
located, Kodak said it would suspend changes in the structure of wages and 
salaries in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said the actions "invade sacred areas of the company but are a needed 
remedy for the ills that have resulted in disappointing second-quarter 
results." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, the company announced earnings fell 85% in the second quarter, down 
to $60 million, or 18 cents a share, from a record $390 million, or $1.20 a 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, earnings fell 60% to $260 million, or 80 cents a 
share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said units would attack costs by cutting back on excessive inventories 
and by shortening the length of time between sales and receipt of payment.

YOUR WHEELS: SOME SERVICE WRITERS ARE AFTER A SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I understand that service writers at auto service shops typically are 
given incentive pay figured as a percentage of the total of the service orders 
that they write. This is on top of their straight salary. Would this not 
motivate them to order maintenance and repairs that are unnecessary? I have got 
to wonder about this after paying for a fuel-filter change during a 30,000-mile 
service on my 1987 Camry. The Toyota factory representative later advised me 
that this was not recommended as necessary. -- F.N. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Certainly, the widespread practice of dealerships and, to a lesser 
extent, independent garages to pay commissions to service writers, based on the 
amount of repair work they bill to customers, appeals to some of the worst 
business instincts imaginable. It is almost like the government giving defense 
companies contracts that pay greater profits if they incur cost overruns. Such 
contracts are outlawed, but apparently motorists are not as well protected. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who take their car in for service must realize that the friendly 
service writer that warmly greets them at the front desk all too often wants to 
sell service -- and the more the better. The service writer is part auto 
diagnostician, part salesman and part psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dealerships typically earn huge profits on their service operations. In some 
cases, profit margins amount to an awesome 50% of receipts, far more than car 
manufacturers would ever dream of making, according to experts. It means that 
the frugal motorist is jumping into uncharted waters and possibly 
shark-infested waters just to get a car fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealerships require that their service writers be aggressive salesmen. If 
a motorist comes in with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work, why not sell a 
tune-up? That can add more than $100 to the bill, and at a standard 10% 
commission that puts another $10 into the service writer's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has probably gotten worse in recent years. Car manufacturers are 
recommending less and less regular maintenance, such as the fuel filter in the 
reader's question. So, dealerships are beginning to tell motorists that they 
should buy more service than the manufacturer recommends. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the dealership may be right, but the potential for abuse is so 
vast that it should raise a lot of red flags any time a garage recommends 
service that is not specified in the owners' manual. You should ask why and ask 
the service writer to justify it. If you have guts, ask him if he earns a 
commission too. 
</P>
<P>
You should know that it is not just the service writers who are paid 
commissions. The mechanics and parts-desk salesmen often earn commissions as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look at the Other Side 
</P>
<P>
Having been made aware of all this, you should realize that service writers can 
also be decent, honest people who make every effort to only recommend service 
or repairs that are needed. Just because they earn a commission doesn't mean 
they want to sell a brake job when you don't need one. After all, washing 
machine salesmen and stock brokers earn commissions too. Even senators get 
honorariums, which is probably worse than commissions. 
</P>
<P>
The important factor in choosing a repair garage or dealership is to find a 
professionally run operation. Look for a clean, well-organized garage. The 
mechanics should be disciplined and clear-minded. If a service writer is pushy, 
beg off and find another garage. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, garages know that their success depends on building a base of 
loyal customers, rather than ripping off everybody who walks in the door. So, 
look to see that the same service writer is at your garage every time. The same 
applies to the mechanics. You don't want to get stuck with an outfit that turns 
over its work force every month.

LEGAL VIEW: HOME BUYERS CAN GUARD AGAINST LOSS OF DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buying or selling a home is a tense, emotionally draining experience, even if 
things go well. But if the deal falls apart, the experience can be 
excruciatingly painful and very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers both wind up angry, and often the anger is directed at the 
escrow company, the third party that acts as the neutral intermediary between 
the two. That's because the escrow company has control of the funds deposited 
by the buyer, and both buyer and seller may think the money is rightfully 
theirs, especially if each thinks the other is to blame for the wrangle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Certain Contingencies 
</P>
<P>
A home purchase may fall apart for any number of common reasons. Usually, the 
sale is conditioned upon certain contingencies that just don't occur. The buyer 
may not be able to obtain financing. The home may be infested with termites. A 
geological or structural inspection may find hidden defects. The seller may 
just get cold feet and change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, for the buyer to get the deposit back, the escrow company 
will usually require written instructions signed by both buyer and seller 
canceling the escrow and stating how the deposit will be refunded. Even if it 
is very obvious to you, whether you're a buyer or seller, that the other person 
is completely at fault, the escrow company will not refund the money unless 
both parties agree in writing. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow company is a neutral stake holder. "They are not supposed to 
interpret, extrapolate . . . or prophesize," observes Doug Ring, a Century City 
real estate lawyer. "If they return money without having properly documented 
the (approvals from both sides), the escrow company can be held liable by the 
party who did not give them the instructions." 
</P>
<P>
When both sides can't agree to written cancellation instructions, the money 
will be held by the escrow company until a court determines who should 
rightfully receive it, or the parties settle the dispute. The escrow company 
can file something called an interpleader action, in which it goes to court and 
says essentially, "Hey, I have this money, please tell me who I should give it 
to." 
</P>
<P>
The escrow agreement usually provides that the escrow company will be 
reimbursed for its legal fees, which means that the deposit will be used to pay 
the escrow company's attorneys. Even without such an agreement, the judge has 
discretion to award attorney's fees and usually does, according to real estate 
lawyer Barry Mitidiere. Because the deposit is commonly under $10,000, there 
may be little or nothing left once the fees are paid. Instead of losing the 
deposit to the seller, it goes to the lawyers representing the escrow company. 
In any event, the buyer isn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that this is how such disputes often end, it is wise to forget about 
the legal solution and try to work out a settlement with the parties, with the 
help of the real estate agents, especially if the deposit is not large. 
</P>
<P>
There is a better way to help prevent your money from being frozen in an escrow 
account -- a properly drafted purchase and sale agreement. The contract should 
contain what Ring calls a "self-destruct" provision, which states that "if the 
contingencies have not been met by a specific date, then the escrow holder is 
hereby instructed to terminate the escrow and return the deposit less actual 
escrow fees and costs." Then, in effect, the cancellation instructions have 
been signed in advance and become effective if the specified date arrives and 
the escrow hasn't closed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ring, such a provision is not commonly found in the preprinted 
form residential purchase agreements usually provided by the real estate 
brokerage company or the escrow company. (Of course, it is not in a real estate 
agent's best interest to make it too easy for the parties to get out of the 
deal. On the other hand, a good real estate agent can often save a sale that is 
about to fall apart.) It may be worthwhile to discuss with your real estate 
agent or lawyer whether one should be added to the form you use when you buy or 
sell a house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discuss With Agent 
</P>
<P>
However, even such a provision does not guarantee protection, because the 
escrow company will freeze the deposit and won't distribute the funds if one 
party advises in writing that a dispute exists, Ring adds. 
</P>
<P>
Incidently, if you are depositing a large sum of money for a long time, you 
should consider requesting that the escrow company deposit the funds in an 
interest-bearing account for your benefit. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know more about the escrow process or selling a home, here are 
two good resource books: "For Sale by Owner" by George Devine and "All About 
Escrow" by Sandy Gadow.

YOUR COINS: DOWNTOWN SHOP GETS 'BACK TO BASICS' 
</P>

<P>
The last remaining full-service coin-and-stamp dealership in downtown Los 
Angeles is having a grand opening in a new location -- only a block from where 
it had been situated since 1968 and not much farther from where it opened in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
Century Stamp &amp; Coin Co. has seen good times and bad since its inception 
right after World War II. Currently, times are good, and the family-owned 
enterprise has decided to move into custom-designed quarters at 509 W. 6th St., 
making it not only the oldest downtown coin store but also the newest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Business 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Ray and Stan Lundgren founded the firm, which is now run by David 
Griffiths, who married Ray's daughter, Barbara, and whose children, Shelley and 
Todd, now participate in the third-generation operation. Griffiths has been in 
the business since 1961, giving Century continuity and stability. 
</P>
<P>
Since the '50s and '60s, downtown Los Angeles has lost about 20 dealerships. 
Some dealers have retired, some have died, and others have moved to trendier 
locations, such as Beverly Hills. Century alone has remained, and the obvious 
question is why. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," Griffiths said, "it's just tradition. We like dealing with the public 
and we like downtown because there are a great number of people here. And, of 
course, we want to remain loyal to our customers who have remained loyal to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths is a life member of the American Numismatic Assn., a member of the 
Silver Dollar Round Table, a Numismatic Guaranty Corp. dealer, a member of the 
American Numismatic Exchange and other trade and industry organizations. His 
company purchases large estates and coin and stamp collections. He's also 
involved in appraisals and investment planning. As such, he has a sound 
overview of trends in the coin business. 
</P>
<P>
"Certified grading services are in the forefront right now," Griffiths said. 
"As a result, the American Numismatic Exchange came about, similar to the stock 
market, with bid and ask prices on certified coins. There are 150 market makers 
-- we're one of them -- in addition to major brokerage houses getting involved 
to the tune of $40 million to $100 million in limited partnerships. Suddenly, 
this has become big business. 
</P>
<P>
"But personally I still prefer the collector to the investor. And I'm going 
back to the collector, especially in this new location. We have to get back to 
the basics and give more time and guidance to the collector and less time to 
the pure investor. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who make money in numismatics will take 20 years to build a 
collection -- maybe invest $50,000 during that time. If done properly, you 
might be able to sell it for $1 million. That's the way to do it. You build a 
collection with a plan in mind. I'm not saying investors can't make money. But 
buying 100 or 500 silver dollars is a very risky investment, in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I prefer raw (uncertified) coins, but the younger generation seems 
to prefer certified coins. We deal in both at Century, although collectors 
still lean toward raw coins -- if they do their homework. I was fortunate when 
I started. I did my homework and I had some great teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Century can be reached by telephone at (213) 626-4027 or (800) 234-CENT.

<P>
Question: How valuable is my 1886 dime? -- D.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your dime is a Liberty seated type. Chances are it's worth from $3 to 
$25, depending upon condition. If it has an S mint mark (located on the reverse 
below the wreath), it can be worth considerably more. High-grade specimens and 
mint-state proofs can be worth more than $500.

HOUR OF CRISIS IN TRAUMA CARE; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE A THRIVING AND ACCESSIBLE NETWORK, TRAUMA CARE FACILITIES ARE IN TROUBLE 
-- AND THE NEED IS GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The accident victim moaned in agony as doctors examined the tire marks that 
stretched across his burly chest. Witnesses said he had been drinking. They saw 
him backing his truck up on a Pacoima street when, somehow, he fell out and the 
truck rolled over him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had suffered massive injuries to his ribs and lungs, and, on this recent 
Friday night, the late-night emergency crew at the Holy Cross Medical Center 
trauma unit in Mission Hills was trying to find out if there was any internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County trauma care system, like the patients it tries to save, 
is in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the system was launched with eight hospitals. By 1985 there were 23 
hospitals in the system, but today only 13 are left. Both St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank and Whittier Presbyterian Hospital have closed their units in 
recent months. And now Holy Cross, whose trauma center lost $1.5 million last 
year and expects similar losses this year, could be the next casualty. 
</P>
<P>
Diane New, director of emergency and trauma services at Holy Cross, said that 
since the beginning of 1989, the hospital has evaluated the trauma center 
monthly instead of every six months and while there are no immediate plans to 
shut it down, "I can't tell you it will definitely be here in a few months." 
</P>
<P>
That would mean the end of a service that has on the premises a surgeon, 
anesthesiologist and operating team 24 hours a day. Unlike the old days of 
emergency care, where a surgeon and the assisting team had to be rounded up, 
sometimes causing fatal delays, a trauma victim can be on the operating table 
in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And it would mean that the San Fernando Valley would have only one trauma 
facility -- Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be going back to the dark ages of emergency medical care services," said 
Virginia Price Hastings, head of paramedic and trauma hospital programs for the 
county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said hospitals have been dropping out of the system primarily because 
of losses incurred from uninsured patients; 55% of all county trauma patients 
are uninsured. In addition, the average cost for a surgeon and anesthesiologist 
in a 24-hour shift is $1,500 each. Some facilities -- such as Holy Cross -- 
have subsidized their trauma centers with profits from other departments. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings is counting on help from the state Legislature, which may as early as 
next month vote to allocate money raised by last year's Proposition 99 tobacco 
tax for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
"Without some funding from the state, the situation is going to get worse," 
Hastings said. "I'm absolutely convinced we will lose a few more before the 
year is out. 
</P>
<P>
"They went into this with the clear understanding of being self-supportive," 
she said. "But the method for reimbursing for health care has changed, and the 
cost has been passed on to the hospitals. We all expected more people to be 
insured." 
</P>
<P>
Although Holy Cross has not received as many additional trauma patients as 
originally expected with the closure of the St. Joseph unit, the team admits 
that it feels the extra pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just do it," said Melanie Kelham, an emergency nurse. "We know exactly 
what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The accident victim, 41, mumbled in Spanish. He was in shock. Larry Andersen, 
an emergency technician, told him to remain calm as doctors inserted tubes to 
analyze his urine and checked his vital signs. Once the patient was stabilized, 
Dr. Peter Hong, the surgeon on duty, called for a chest X-ray. Other tests 
showed that there was blood in the man's abdomen. The patient was on the 
operating table in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We intervene," said Dr. Michael Sarti, an emergency room physician. "This is a 
way station. We stabilize the patient and move him toward the operating room as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the trauma center staff believe in the "Golden Hour" rule: If they 
can begin administering care to a trauma patient within one hour of an 
accident, chances are the person will survive. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 645 trauma cases that Holy Cross had last year, 96%, or 621 patients, 
survived initial treatment and subsequent recovery periods. A similar 
percentage lived through their operations and treatment at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
A trauma is generally defined as penetrating injuries to the chest and abdomen, 
which usually mean knife or gunshot wounds; falls greater than 15 feet; head 
injuries with a loss of consciousness; vehicle accidents in which someone has 
been ejected; severe burns, and injuries where life or limb is immediately 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases at Holy Cross involve vehicles, although about 11% to 15% 
result from stab or gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the trauma center crisis a major problem for every single person in 
this country," Hastings said. "An accident can happen to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the injury, to the emergency staff, survival doesn't necessarily spell 
success. Although they may survive the original treatment, many patients spend 
months and even years in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
"Success is a person leaving with a decent quality of life," said Tom George, a 
respiratory technician. "I don't consider someone who becomes a vegetable a 
success. But in trauma, we have some successes. To see the terrible accident 
victim leave the hospital is so rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some members of the trauma staff don't hide the excitement 
they feel when a patient arrives. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to like a certain pace to work down here," said Jim Glazier, a 
medical technician. "Upstairs on the floors, it's the same thing night after 
night. Here, people enjoy the challenge. If they didn't, it would kill them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Hong made a long incision in the victim's abdomen. There was massive internal 
bleeding stemming from a severely ruptured liver. The victim's survival 
depended on whether Hong could stop the bleeding. One white rag after another 
was used to control the flood, but it would not stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a nurse informed Hong that another trauma case was about to arrive 
at the hospital. He continued to operate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's so quiet that you wonder if the world is still out there," 
Glazier said. "And then there are days where we are lucky to get anything to 
eat in 12 hours, and we don't get a chance to go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
On one recent weekend, Friday and Saturday nights produced no trauma cases. The 
only visitors to the emergency room were young children who bumped their heads 
and drunks who got into fights. (Normally, the unit will receive about two or 
three trauma cases a night.) But the following weekend, in just two hours, the 
trauma unit received three cases. 
</P>
<P>
When the center is quiet, the staff usually helps out on minor emergency room 
cases or relaxes in the lounge. They work 12-hour shifts and know how to pace 
themselves. Favorite topics are the quality of the night's coffee and why the 
refrigerator is never stocked with anything appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like sailing," said Dr. Richard Benedon, a trauma physician. "It's either 
boring or terrifying. The rate at which it goes from calm to chaos is amazing. 
All we need is to hear a few things on that radio and we'll scatter in no 
time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 As Hong continued to operate on the man with a ruptured liver, Joe Altshule, 
the clerk, announced the imminent arrival of the next patient: "This guy's real 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The "guy," 22, was driving southbound on the Antelope Valley Freeway, just 
north of the Golden State Freeway, when his jeep struck the center divider. He 
had been drinking, lost control of the jeep and was ejected. His passenger and 
girlfriend, 19, was thrown from the vehicle. Neither had been wearing a seat 
belt. A third passenger, sitting in the back seat, was wearing a belt and 
wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured couple were wheeled in by paramedics. The girl had suffered 
multiple scrapes and a broken collarbone. She was conscious. Her boyfriend was 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave him a CAT-scan to determine the extent of his massive head injuries. 
Within minutes, they discovered that he had a sub-dural hematoma -- bleeding in 
the lining of the brain. The prognosis offered almost no hope. A brain surgeon, 
summoned from home when the call came in, was unsure that surgery would make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man's family had already arrived and was in shock. The girl kept 
asking about her boyfriend. She was released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scattered along the wall in the emergency room corridor are dozens of photos 
taken by the trauma staff, including the backside of a drunken female who 
evidently did not realize that her gown was open. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I guess humor is our release," said nurse Marty Peters. 
</P>
<P>
The staff draws close to the patients. Some visit them regularly in intensive 
care even when it is not part of their medical duties. They ask each other 
constantly about the status of former trauma patients. Details from previous 
years are hard to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers recall a patient whose head injuries from a motorcycle accident were 
so severe that he could not be transferred to another hospital. For nearly two 
years, until his death in 1987, he barely hung on to life. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to ring up his bill all the time," said Mary Wolf, a nurse. "He cost 
the hospital a lot of money. It was overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
It was actually about $500,000, according to Holy Cross officials, who cite 
that sum as an example of the financial burden the hospital must face in 
treating patients who are uninsured or under-insured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The man with the ruptured liver was moved to intensive care. He died shortly 
after 7 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how fast that guy went into surgery, it wouldn't matter," Hong 
said. "There was just too much damage to the liver." 
</P>
<P>
 The young accident victim underwent surgery to relieve the pressure in his 
brain. After several hours, he was moved to intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
 He died four days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are pretty critical of ourselves," Glazier said. "You talk about 
what didn't go as clean as it should have or what we could have done better. 
But we know we can't save everyone. But at least we are there to try every 
time." 
</P>

Palm Trees Galore 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are a lot of palm trees on Sherman Way in Van Nuys, Reseda and 
Canoga Park. More than 1,000 of them grace the thoroughfare from Van Nuys 
Boulevard to Valley Circle Boulevard, according to Duane Gute Sr., 
superintendent of Los Angeles' Street Tree Division. And most of them, he 
believes, were planted about 1911. 
</P>
<P>
It's quite possible that those palm trees -- California fan palms, Mexican fan 
palms, date palms and queen palms -- will be around longer than we will since 
they sometimes live to be more than 100 years old. There's documentation that 
some trees have lived more than 188 years. "We have some in the city that are 
about 150 years old," Gute said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for replacements, the city is not too keen anymore on planting its 
signature trees, some of which can grow to be more than 100 feet tall. "If you 
have a uniform street of palm trees and one dies, we'll replace it with another 
one -- a smaller one, of course," Gute said. "But generally there are a lot of 
problems with palm trees. They grow into overhead wires and there's seed-pod 
droppage. A citizen walks on it and slips and falls on the sidewalk. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Quick: What's a Carhop? 
</P>
<P>
Opening your own restaurant entails solving a lot of problems, but Tim Shpall 
of Sun Valley encountered one that threatens the basic gimmick of his new 
eatery. 
</P>
<P>
"My place is called Cadillac Jack's and it's a '50s drive-in," the 40-year-old 
entrepreneur said. "We have carhops but there's a diner inside too. What I find 
very odd is that no one takes advantage of the carhops. It's like nobody under 
the age of 35 even knows what a carhop is." 
</P>
<P>
Shpall had to make a business decision. He cut back the carhop service to 
weekends only. "I used to have two girls standing out there just looking at 
each other twiddling their thumbs," he said. "As soon as it starts to catch on, 
we'll do it again on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
Located on San Fernando Road in Sun Valley, the hot-pink restaurant has a 1955 
Cadillac parked out in front. Shpall put $10,000 worth of neon lighting on the 
exterior. Inside he made light fixtures out of old hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there was a foreshadowing of his problem when Shpall had trouble even 
finding the car trays. "I called every restaurant equipment wholesaler in Los 
Angeles and after they quit laughing at me, they said no, they didn't have 
them. I found out, though, that the original company that made them is still in 
business in Dallas," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When Shpall is in need of solace, he retreats to his office in the back of the 
restaurant. Its walls are covered with posters of Elvis, Elvira and Alf. "Why 
not surround yourself with the three greatest minds in American culture?" he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy Business 
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking about getting into the stretch limousine business, forget 
it. Ditto for tanning salons, yogurt shops and fitness centers. "Those markets 
are saturated," said Ted Walters, assistant vice president for the Money Store 
Investment Corp. in Encino, a U. S. Small Business Administration lender. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California trends frequently translate into entrepreneurial 
opportunities, but like a summer tan, the trends fade after a while. Small 
business lenders in the San Fernando Valley have yet to notice a Southern 
California-type trend that might replace the ones mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going through a lull now," Walters said. "We went through a real 
creative period in small business start-ups, but then the market leveled out 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
So what other type of small businesses are growing these days? "The 
communications industry is increasing, like stores that sell cellular phones or 
fax machines," noted Arthur Sweet, president of Val-Ven California BIDCO 
(Business Industrial Development Co.) in North Hollywood, another SBA lender. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Walker, vice president of Industrial Bank in Van Nuys, added that the 
video production industry is also doing quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Pet Project 
</P>
<P>
Pettpourri is still her hobby -- not her job -- but it's taking up more of 
Andrea Pett's time these days. "I started putting out my newsletter last summer 
after I graduated from UCLA because I had no more schoolwork to do and I wanted 
to keep busy," recalled Pett, 23, of Tarzana. "And I've always loved animals." 
</P>
<P>
Pett was working at an office in which she was the unofficial expert on animal 
issues. "The ladies would ask me where to take their dog to get spayed, or what 
to do about a certain problem, and finally I said, 'Why don't I write this all 
down for you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Using her home computer to create simple graphics, she wrote her first 
newsletter, focusing on local animal organizations and clinics. She distributed 
the newsletter free of charge to vets, groomers, pet supply stores, friends and 
relatives. People loved it. She now has more than 1,000 names on her mailing 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter has expanded. A column called "Animal Kingdom Notes" alerts 
readers to international animal rights issues. Other columns list free programs 
and services for pet owners, and there's an events calendar. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth issue comes out next month. It's still free, although Pett has 
accepted a few advertisers to help defray mailing costs. (She sends any surplus 
advertising money to animal organizations. Between them, Pett and her sister, 
Cynthia Pett, belong to about 30.) 
</P>
<P>
Pett owns two dogs and three cats. "With the last name Pett, it's kind of hard 
not to like animals," Pett said. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the newsletter, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to 
Pettpourri, 5907 Cahill Ave., Tarzana 91356.

WHO'S WHO?;

<P>
MEET THE NEW BAND, NOT THE SAME BAND 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene before the Who stepped on stage Tuesday night at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium looked grim for anyone who has ever cared about the legendary 
British rock group. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime Who fans, in fact, have been anxious since hearing the news that 
the three surviving members of the band -- guitarist Pete Townshend, singer 
Roger Daltrey and bassist John Entwistle -- were going on the road again. 
</P>
<P>
This return -- seven years after a highly successful "farewell" tour -- 
conjured up visions of a veteran prizefighter who, driven by either ego or 
money, just can't call it quits. So he ends up stepping into the ring one time 
too many and gets humiliated by the lightning jabs of a younger and stronger 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
In the Who's case, there was no chance these musicians, all in their mid-40s, 
would be upstaged by some young rock 'n' roll hotshots, because there is no 
support act on the tour, which includes stops tonight at the Universal 
Amphitheatre and Saturday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But the group's performances would invariably be weighed against the greatness 
of the band's shows back in its prime, when the Who was rivaled as a creative 
force in Britain only by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Could the Who -- 
now celebrating its 25th anniversary -- still stand tall against that memory? 
</P>
<P>
The outlook wasn't good at the start of the evening because of all the 
commercialism surrounding the show. 
</P>
<P>
First, huge banners advertising the tour-sponsoring beer covered the banks of 
speakers on both sides of the stage. Then, disc jockeys from radio station 91-X 
(XTRA-FM) came on stage to welcome the more than 40,000 fans, plugging the 
station six times in three sentences. 
</P>
<P>
While the jocks were promoting the station, an airplane was circling the 
stadium pulling a banner that reminded the audience that the Who's gala, 
benefit performance of the rock opera "Tommy" tonight at the Universal 
Amphitheatre would be carried live, on a pay-per-view basis, on cable TV. 
Implored the banner: "Order now." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Townshend would have broken a guitar over the head of 
anyone who tried to capitalize on the band in such a manner. 
</P>
<P>
By allowing the hucksterism, the band -- which fell at least 10,000 seats short 
of a sellout -- seemed severed from its own proud and independent heritage. 
Would its music be just as compromised? 
</P>
<P>
But this tour deliberately sidesteps direct comparisons with the original Who. 
That's why there should be an asterisk by the band's name this time around, to 
distinguish it from the true Who. Instead of the creative glow and spontaneous 
fury of the days when it was a quartet and still included the late Keith Moon 
on drums, this edition of the Who* featured drummer Simon Phillips and was 
augmented by 11 other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
This lineup -- a five-piece horn section, three backup singers, a keyboardist, 
a percussionist and a second electric guitarist -- resulted in a more 
deliberate and polished presentation. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, notably key moments in the half-hour mini-version of "Tommy" 
that opened the three-hour concert, the added musicians enriched the songs, 
adding to their majesty. Elsewhere, however, the added trappings seemed 
overblown, sometimes flattening the music's emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was an inspiring sense of determination and pride as the Who* took 
the stage at 7:30 p.m. and the beer banners were suddenly pulled down and 
replaced by Who banners sporting a colorful series of pinball images. 
</P>
<P>
For all the pre-tour warnings from Townshend that his hearing problems would 
force him into a reduced role, he skipped about the stage with the joy of a man 
doing what he loves, and he set down the acoustic guitar at several points to 
play electric guitar with the fury and bite of old. Despite a brace on his 
right hand to guard against aggravating a cut suffered on stage last weekend, 
he often punctuated his playing with his old patented windmill strokes. 
</P>
<P>
That same pride and craft were evident in the performances of Daltrey and 
Entwistle, and the added musicians, too, seemed well drilled. 
</P>
<P>
For all the spirit of the musicians, however, the real triumph of the concert 
rested in the continuing power of the Who's songs. Pop music performers over 40 
are often equated with nostalgia. That's because most pop songs are so flimsy 
that the only emotions they provoke after a few years is the memory of what you 
were doing when you first heard them. 
</P>
<P>
But the best rock songs -- including the introspective works of Bob Dylan, Neil 
Young, John Fogerty and Townshend -- continue to offer listeners, young and 
old, new insights and stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
Both Townshend's short works -- from "The Kids Are Alright" to "Won't Get 
Fooled Again" -- and the longer "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia" express the 
frustrations and desires of youth, and are every bit as artful and illuminating 
in their way as books by Salinger or Kerouac. That restlessness and fury still 
echo in the Who's records and in parts of the new Who* tour. 
</P>
<P>
After "Tommy," the spiritually accented story of a young boy who tries to find 
comfort and meaning in a world where human cruelty contributed to an incident 
in which he was struck "deaf, dumb and blind," the band moved through a 
predictable set of Who favorites, ending with a playfully nostalgic version of 
the Isley Brothers' old "Twist and Shout." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, which could also watch the action on three large video screens, was 
wondrously responsive, singing along with such tunes as "Magic Bus" and "Baba 
O'Reilly." 
</P>
<P>
The audience was dominated by fans in their late teens and early 20s who were 
seeing the band for the first time, but was also sprinkled heavily with older 
Who fans coming back for, perhaps, a final look. Not everyone was pleased with 
what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
A 41-year-old computer technician from Santa Ana objected to the size of the 
band, quipping, "They must have half of the musicians' union up there with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the two dozen fans interviewed, however, seemed thrilled just to be 
able to see the band again -- especially the younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured this was the last chance I'd ever have to see them," said a 
17-year-old high school student from El Cajon. A 39-year-old banking executive 
added, "This isn't the band that I used to love, but the music still stands up 
and I wanted to say goodby. Besides, none of us is the same as we were 20 years 
ago. I remember hitchhiking 100 miles to see the Who the first time. Tonight, I 
drove here in my Mercedes." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. There's no way this Who* tour is as stirring as the old Who shows, 
but there's never a substitute for the tension surrounding a band at its 
creative peak. Still, it's hard not to be touched by the continuing competitive 
spirit and desire of these musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply honor the band's own history with these shows, the three 
surviving members seem to be saluting the intense relationship that existed 
between the Who and its fans -- and, at the same time, paying tribute to an era 
in rock. After a quarter-century, Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle are far from 
kids, but they're still all right.

SUMMERFEST'S SHOSTAKOVICH A HIGH NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, Tuesday night's SummerFest '89 program looked like a preview 
for this fall's Soviet arts festival. After a polite beginning with a Beethoven 
cello sonata, two major Soviet works from the mid-century, by Shostakovich and 
Prokofiev, were performed back to back. 
</P>
<P>
This rare opportunity to compare these two works in live performance was not, 
however, the original design of festival director Heiichiro Ohyama. In his 
usual fashion, Ohyama intended to follow the Prokofiev with a palliative, the 
congenial idiom of Dvorak's Piano Quartet. When Andre Previn had to be replaced 
with Russian pianist Yefim Bronfman), the Dvorak was scrapped and replaced with 
the Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's performance of Mel Powell's 1982 Quartet, the rumor may spread 
that SummerFest has become a hotbed of modernism in spite of itself. At very 
least, the enthusiastic reception the Sherwood Auditorium audience lavished on 
the Shostakovich Piano Trio at the program's conclusion demonstrated that 
SummerFest audiences do not need to be protected from the music of their own 
century. It required no graduate degree in music theory to appreciate the 
transcendent performance violinist Cho-Liang Lin, cellist Gary Hoffman and 
Bronfman gave Shostakovich's demanding musical monument to the anguish of war. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1944 and composed during some of World War II's darkest hours, the 
Piano Trio in E Minor, Op. 67, encompasses the composer's outrage and elegy. 
Tuesday's compelling performance deftly balanced austere introspection and 
passionate outburst. The finale's frenzied dance section was simultaneously 
demonic and life-affirming in its fury. And, although the three players 
exhibited an uncanny concentration and unanimity of purpose, Lin's absolute 
purity of tone and exquisite phrasing raised the Trio performance to an 
incandescent level. Bronfman proved a strong but supportive collaborator, 
choosing a less aggressive keyboard approach than the one he used for Sunday's 
Brahms' Piano Quintet. 
</P>

Prokofiev's Quintet in G Minor, Op. 39, for three strings and two woodwinds, 
first performed in 1927, is actually a suite salvaged from a failed ballet, 
"Trapeze." A welcome antidote to the facile idiom of the composer's more 
familiar concert works (the "Classical" Symphony and Third Piano Concerto, for 
example), the quintet's sardonic counterpoint elicits an intellectual response 
rather than a warm, emotional outpouring. Violinist Masuko Ushioda and oboist 
Gerard Reuter provided unbending, vigorous leadership in this satisfying 
interpretation.

Jane Fonda says her visit to an Aztec ruin being excavated in the city in 1979 
inspired her to make "The Old Gringo," a movie about the meeting of Mexicans 
and Americans during the Mexican Revolution. "I went down down into that hole, 
and saw a whole other civilization beneath the surface," Fonda said. "I had a 
very visceral reaction to the thought that someone from another country could 
come in and think they had a better religion, a better system." Based on the 
novel by Carlos Fuentes, "The Old Gringo" is a fictitious account of what 
happened when the American writer Ambrose Bierce disappeared in Mexico during 
the 1910-21 revolution. Daniel Cerone and Claudia Puig

Vietnam War veterans on Wednesday criticized director Brian DePalma's new 
anti-war movie "Casualties of War," saying it falsely depicts American soldiers 
as rapists and incompetents. In a news conference at the Army-Navy Club in 
Washington, John Wheeler, president of the Center for the Vietnam Generation, 
said the Columbia film "causes a lot of pain to vets and to those who love them 
. . . by using false stereotypes." "Casualties of War," co-starring Michael J. 
Fox and Sean Penn, opened Aug. 18 to some rave reviews. The film is based on a 
1969 book and New Yorker magazine article about a patrol of American GIs who 
kidnap, rape and murder a South Vietnamese girl in 1966. Peggy Siegal, 
DePalma's press representative, said the director had no comment, but added he 
"made an anti-war film and they were all casualties of that war." Claudia Puig

Former child film star Shirley Temple Black on Wednesday gave President Gustav 
Husak her credentials as the new U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia, the 
official news agency CTK said. Black arrived in the country on Aug. 11. She 
last was in Prague 21 years ago, attending a congress when Warsaw Pact tanks 
rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush its 1968 "Prague Spring" reforms. Black, 
who won a special 1935 Oscar for her contribution to screen entertainment, has 
held a number of official U.S. posts, including ambassador to Ghana from 
1974-76. Daniel Cerone and Claudia Puig

THE POLITICS OF LEMONS; 
</P>
<P>
A GROUP OF GROWERS' REPRESENTATIVES SET WEEKLY SHIPPING QUOTAS. IN EFFECT, THEY 
CONTROL PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The summer's lemon harvest is drawing to a close throughout Ventura County, the 
nation's leading production area, as skeleton crews comb the orchards for the 
season's few remaining ripe fruits. 
</P>
<P>
Growers in towns such as Saticoy and Santa Paula are left to congratulate 
themselves on one of the most successful years of the past decade. The demand 
for fresh lemons is high and prices have approached record levels. 
</P>
<P>
With little disruption, the harvest will now move into the desert groves of 
California's Coachella Valley and Arizona's Yuma County. There, farm workers 
will continue to pick fruit for much of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Lemons are readily available throughout the year because of just such varied 
plantings, each located in different climatic regions. Other prime growing 
areas still waiting to produce in the 1989-1990 growing season include the San 
Joaquin Valley and San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, an important factor in the well-being of the lemon crop results from 
committee meetings that regularly take place far from the widely dispersed 
orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Each Tuesday morning, a number of growers and processors gather to discuss the 
lemon industry's fate in a most unlikely place:the ninth floor of a dingy 
office building in downtown Los Angeles' fashion district. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a smoke-filled conference room, the Lemon Administrative Committee 
meets to determine how much of the crop will enter U.S. markets the following 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which is sanctioned under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act 
of 1937, has jurisdiction over all lemons grown in California and Arizona, or 
about 97% of the U.S. total. (The remaining fraction is raised in Florida, 
which operates free of the Los Angeles-based committee.) 
</P>
<P>
Granted, lemons are far from a dietary staple and are not consumed in the same 
manner as most other fruits. They are used, instead, as a garnish, flavoring 
agent or baking ingredient. As a result, how a labyrinth of regulations governs 
the crop probably has mattered little to the public in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But lemons have shared in the growing interest in all fresh produce. And not 
only have consumers' lemon purchases risen as a result, but so have those by 
the restaurant and institutional food-service industries. 
</P>
<P>
In an annual report filed last month with Agriculture Secretary Clayton 
Yeutter, the Lemon Administration Committee defined its mission. 
</P>
<P>
"An area where the lemon grower can exert influence in the distribution and 
sales system is that portion of the crop reaching the domestic market. He can . 
. . make sure that domestic shipments do not reach a level that will cause 
fire-sale pricing and that places so much fruit on the domestic market that the 
normal flow of harvesting and packing is interrupted," the report states. "It 
is in the growers' interest that such interruptions do not happen and it is the 
goal of the Lemon Administrative Committee to see that they do not happen." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the prospect of stable supplies and prices would appear 
welcome in a grower community too often beset by boom or bust cycles. But the 
committee has some harsh critics. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is a disservice to the consumer," said Skip Pescosolido, co-owner 
of Sequoia Orange Co. in Exeter, Calif., who favors deregulation of the lemon 
industry. "At least 100,000 cartons of lemons that could be sold are prevented 
from reaching the market each year. That is a disservice." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, little is heard about the committee that determines the fate of an 
estimated $210-million lemon crop. 
</P>
<P>
Although its meetings are open to the public, the committee works in anonymity, 
making decisions that affect 60,000 acres of lemon orchards. It's one of the 
few agricultural groups that uses its authority under the federal marketing 
order to, in essence, centrally plan a food commodity. (Navel and Valencia 
oranges are the only other crops with similar provisions in their grower-voted 
charters.) 
</P>
<P>
Few people in or out of the lemon business fully understand the committee's 
complex inner workings and jargon. A number of produce industry representatives 
declined to even comment on the committee's work because of its intricacies. 
Thus the "politics of lemons" are left to some of the industry's major players. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among these is Sunkist Growers Inc., a Sherman Oaks-based cooperative 
whose membership represents about 65% of all lemons grown in California and 
Arizona. In 1988, the co-op reported about $140 million from the sale of fresh 
lemons, both in the domestic and export markets, as well as those diverted to 
other industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
Individual growers are each empowered to elect representatives to the 
administrative committee under the marketing order that established the group. 
However, the seats are apportioned so that Sunkist controls six, while an equal 
number are allotted to independent growers and packers. 
</P>
<P>
The final member, the chairman, says he does not vote when the two sides are 
evenly split. Thus, six votes are enough to control the committee's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
A Sunkist representative downplays the co-op's power on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more of the lemon production than we have representatives on the 
committee," said Kurt Anderson, a Sunkist vice president. "We've never asked 
for more than what the original marketing order provided for and that was no 
more than half." 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the committee's work is a weekly recommendation on shipping limits 
for fresh lemons, called the prorate allowance:a key decision for a number of 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
By determining the amount of lemons that go into wholesale and retail channels, 
the group is also conversely deciding how much will go into the byproducts 
markets for industrial uses such as juice concentrate or lemon oil for cleaning 
products. While fruit entering the fresh market can be profitable, the crop 
diverted to the byproducts industry, about 36% of the total, is usually sold at 
a financial loss to growers. 
</P>
<P>
The prorate number eventually agreed upon by the group is forwarded to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in Washington for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, more often than not, routinely OKs the group's recommendation. 
Pescosolido says that USDA is just a "rubber stamp" for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the USDA infrequently adjusts the prorate recommendation, the agency 
still plays an active role in monitoring the group, a USDA spokesman said. 
Further, the agency has a representative attend every committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the committee) know it's being regulated and watched," said Clarence 
Steinberg, a USDA public information officer in Washington. "They play the game 
properly. They know they are being scrutinized." 
</P>
<P>
David A. Beavers, the committee manager, says that during the past 10 years the 
USDA has changed the group's shipping recommendation less than 10% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically speaking, the committee is representative of the lemon industry," 
Beavers said. "The USDA looks at the committee as knowledgeable of weekly 
conditions. They rely on that, but it doesn't mean that they don't ever 
question our figures." 
</P>
<P>
The prorate allowance, since it determines the supply availability, indirectly 
sets the wholesale price for lemons in this country. Retail prices are set 
accordingly and have hovered as high as 99 cents a pound in the past year. 
Controlling supply is said to be necessary because of the frequent surplus of 
lemons. 
</P>
<P>
"Prorate stabilizes the market," said Glenn A. Miller, president of the Saticoy 
Lemon Assn. in Santa Paula. "When the market is flooded, then the bottom falls 
out. The last time that happened was in 1986, and growers didn't do well. 
Neither did consumers." 
</P>
<P>
But Pescosolido, who owns 400 acres of lemon orchards in the San Joaquin 
Valley, said that 1986 proved that deregulation works. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, because of a short crop, there was no prorate used for over a 
year. The returns to the grower were the highest in 25 years and in 1986 they 
sold more of their crop than usual," he said. "I refuse to believe that prices 
will crash (if shipping limits are lifted)." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, whose group is affiliated with Sunkist, said that the industry is just 
now synchronizing supply and demand from a glut of lemons more than 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There was tremendous overplanting in the early 1960s," he said. "At that time, 
there were 90,000 acres of lemons. Now there are about 60,000 acres, which is a 
much better balance." 
</P>
<P>
The huge jump in acreage occurred when growers mistakenly anticipated a boom in 
lemon exports to Japan. Although about 22% of the current crop is exported, it 
is far less than original expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The stability that Miller and others favor in the lemon industry, however, is a 
magnet for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"When you control the volume of fruit that is shipped domestically, then that 
will obviously affect the price," said Steve Moore, an organic lemon grower in 
Ventura who has battled with the committee over limits placed on the shipment 
of his crop. "This prorate system does not allow the free market to function, 
and I don't think that is a benefit to the consumer or to me as a grower. It is 
a benefit to the large corporate growers that prefer a stable system. . . . 
They prefer no swings in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Other industry representatives say that if the prorate regulations were 
removed, then produce channels would be flooded with fruit during certain times 
of the year. Such a development might financially squeeze growers into ruin. 
</P>
<P>
"The prorate has proven to be a very excellent mechanism for supplying the 
market on a regular basis to the benefit of the consumer and the grower," said 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Another lemon processor, David Giller, Sun World Inc. vice president of citrus 
marketing operations, supports the prorate regulation, but expresses some 
reservations about the system. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that the (prorate) is overused," said Giller. "We deal with 
other commodities that are not regulated and it is the marketer's job (not a 
committee's) to sell the fruit. . . . Some people feel that the consumer is not 
well served (by the committee) and there is some basis for that." 
</P>
<P>
Giller also said he feels the prorate controls have limited innovation in the 
lemon industry and created complacency. His firm has developed a number of 
significant new produce items, such as the seedless watermelon and the Le Rouge 
Royale red pepper, breakthroughs that would have been unlikely under a 
regulated system such as that in place for lemons. 
</P>
<P>
"We could never have developed the seedless watermelon under this system. It 
stifles creativity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prorate, and the lemon marketing order that created it, have nothing to do 
with product innovation, said Miller of Saticoy Lemon. 
</P>
<P>
"Are innovative things being restricted? That's not true," he said, citing his 
firm's effort to sell more lemons by developing a mesh bag for use by retailers 
that holds several lemons at once. "We're retailing more fruit. In fact, 25% 
more fruit is being shipped now than there was five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
There is little chance that the current lemon marketing order, and its prorate 
provision, will be changed any time soon. The USDA held hearings on the matter 
in 1985 and a set of revised regulations resulted. The proposal offered several 
options in place of the current system, but never advanced beyond the 
preliminary rule-making stages. 
</P>
<P>
For any revision of the marketing order to occur, or for the prorate to be 
eliminated, the lemon growers would have to vote on the matter. Even if such a 
vote were taken, it is unlikely that the current system would be drastically 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
There are some external factors, however, that may prompt a review of lemon 
prorate. Primary among these is that California and Arizona growers face 
increasing competition from oversees operations, including Chile, Spain and the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Lemon Administrative Committee meeting, representatives discussed 
the fact that a major shipment of Bahamian lemons had been distributed in San 
Francisco at $10 per carton less than locally grown fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"The West Coast entry of Bahamian lemons was not a problem in the past," said 
Beavers. "Their growing costs are less than those in California and Arizona but 
their volume has never been substantial. They ship only 600 to 700 carloads of 
fruit, whereas California and Arizona in a normal year ship 45,000 to 57,000 
cars of lemons." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the annual report sent by the committee to the USDA addressed the 
issue of foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The California/Arizona lemon . . . has major competitors in other countries. 
Spain has largely taken over the European market and at times has made 
incursions into the Eastern United States. Chile has made efforts to move into 
the summer lemon market in the same manner it has moved into the soft fruit 
market in the winter," the report stated. "Each of these countries has distinct 
advantages over the United States industry in terms of lower costs and cheaper 
labor. Only a stable and economically profitable industry can prevent such 
incursions." 
</P>
<P>
In the committee's view, an "economically profitable industry" can be achieved 
only with ceilings placed on the number of lemons shipped in this country.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: EVEN DIETERS CAN GET THEIR JUST DESSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eliminating calories and fat from dessert doesn't have to mean eliminating 
taste, or the psychological pleasure indulging in it provides, just to achieve 
balance and moderation in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
While most health professionals recommend the strict approach for calorie-wise 
consumers, the USDA's Human Nutrition and Information Service says that there 
is a place in the diet for dessert. Since fresh fruit doesn't completely 
replace the desire for after- or in-between-meal treats that are sticky and 
rich, the key is to choose these desserts in modest amounts, then balance them 
with foods that are lower in fat, sugars and calories the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half the Fat 
</P>
<P>
HNIS suggests consumers have half the usual amount of fats and sugars 
throughout the day to make room for a dish of ice cream or other favorite 
treat. Or, modify traditional desserts so that they utilize low-fat 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
For this type of imaginative cookery, base desserts on ingredients such as 
unflavored gelatin, low-fat yogurt, evaporated skim milk, egg whites and angel 
food cake. Then, choose fresh fruits like raspberries, peaches, strawberries 
and cherries, which make exceptional flavor accompaniments. 
</P>
<P>
Start out with Frozen Raspberry Yogurt, which takes advantage of plain low-fat 
yogurt instead of whole milk or cream, for nearly half the calories of ice 
cream. To re-create the rich and creamy smoothness of traditional frozen 
desserts, raspberries and cranberry juice cocktail are blended with unflavored 
gelatin to give the treat its frosty smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
Another light but silky fruit dessert is Peach-Almond Mousse. In it, evaporated 
milk, fresh peaches and almond extract are whipped up into a sweet puree. 
Instead of a whipped cream topping, garnish with sliced or chopped fresh 
peaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Layered Look 
</P>
<P>
Cherry Party Compote features layers of sweet cherries, blueberries, pineapple 
chunks and apricot halves, all arranged in an attractive trifle bowl, and 
topped with a splash of white wine and orange liqueur. After a generous 
chilling to allow the flavors to mingle, pour club soda over just before 
serving to add effervescence. 
</P>
<P>
Cherries also are highlighted in another calorie-sparing dessert, Cherry-Brandy 
Ice Cream. 
</P>
<P>
This cool and refreshing dessert tastes rich -- evaporated milk and low-calorie 
whipped topping mix provide its texture. Low-calorie sweetener and brandy 
extract contribute flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Other featured light, summer fruit desserts include Summer Berry Meringue Pie, 
Nectarine-Brandy Sorbet and Raspberry Angel Roll. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRY-BRANDY ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
1 cup pitted and chopped cherries 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon brandy extract 
</P>
<P>
9 packages low-calorie sweetener 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
1 cup evaporated skim milk 
</P>
<P>
1 packet low-calorie whipped topping mix 
</P>
<P>
2 egg whites or 1/4 cup egg substitute 
</P>
<P>
Gently toss cherries with 1 teaspoon extract and 1 package sweetener. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup skim milk in small saucepan. Let stand 5 minutes. 
Stir constantly over low heat until gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove 
from heat, then stir in remaining sweetener and cool. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare whipped topping according to package directions, substituting remaining 
skim milk for water and remaining brandy extract for vanilla. Whip in cooled 
gelatin. Beat egg whites until soft, but not dry, peaks form. Gently fold 
whipped topping mixture and cherries into egg whites. Freeze until firm. Makes 
8 (1/2 cup) servings. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRY PARTY COMPOTE 
</P>
<P>

 WINE NOTES: SMALLER BOTTLES COULD AID SALES SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-five wineries have signed a petition seeking approval to ship, in 
interstate commerce, a 500-milliliter-size bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
The petition to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (BATF) was drawn up and submitted by Merlion Winery of Napa and sent 
to the beer and wine branch of the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
George Viera, president of Merlion, said the petition also had the signatures 
of 35 distributor-marketing people, and he added, "Within the last week I've 
been in contact with BATF and they are considering the proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Viera believes the 500-ml bottle, which is two-thirds of the standard 750-ml 
bottle, will be an excellent size for restaurants owners who now say that 
people are drinking less wine and who see sales slumping because couples cannot 
finish a standard-size bottle, which contains about 25 1/2 ounces. The 500-ml 
bottle holds about 17 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Example of Moderation 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't only moderation that makes this size appropriate," Viera said, "think 
about this nation's balance of trade." He said that in the last few months, his 
company has had inquiries about the 500-ml size bottles of wine from Singapore, 
Hong Kong and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
"But we can't afford to do it (the 500-ml size bottle) for such small markets. 
The glass is very expensive when we buy (bottles) in small quantities. But we 
could compete on an even playing field against the competition overseas if this 
size were permitted in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
At present, the bureau has Standards of Fill regulations that were instituted 
primarily to prevent a winery from putting out a 720-ml bottle, with an ounce 
less than a 750 ml, but that appears to be the same size. The regulations apply 
to wines sold across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
Wines sold within California may now be marketed in any size the winery wants. 
Dehlinger Winery in Sonoma County tested the 500-ml bottle three years ago with 
excellent results, notably in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the regulations permit wine for interstate commerce to be bottled 
in sizes 187 ml, (the so-called split), 375 ml (half-bottle), 750 ml and one 
liter. Said Viera, "Why not the half-liter?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Standard Sizes' 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Actually, I'd like to see all the Standards of Fill regulations 
eliminated. There are no 'standard sizes' for peanut butter and mayonnaise, and 
there should be equal protection of the law for all products. Wine should have 
the same protection that any product has." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the question of consumer protection, Viera added, "Why is the 
consumer who buys wine considered more stupid than the person who buys 
mayonnaise?" 
</P>
<P>
He said a major reason he likes the 500-ml size is that it will "encourage 
people to drink moderate amounts of wine instead of greater amounts." 
</P>
<P>
Viera said the bureau has encouraged public comment on this proposal, and he 
suggests that letters be sent to Richard Mascolo, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms, P.O. Box 385, Washington, D.C. 20044. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Scouffas, acting chief of the wine and beer branch of the bureau, in a 
letter to Viera, said all comments would be given careful consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The Kunde family, one of the largest grape growers in Sonoma County, has broken 
ground and hopes to begin construction soon for a winery on Highway 12 in 
Kenwood. 
</P>
<P>
The winery will be operated by Martin Adams, formerly with Sebastiani and 
Kendall-Jackson. Kunde Vineyards are some of the most respected in Sonoma 
County, and grapes from them have been sold to Sebastiani, Chateau St. Jean and 
numerous other wineries. 
</P>
<P>
Another branch of the Kunde family also owns and operates Sonoma Grapevines 
Inc., the state's largest grapevine bench grafting company.

 CULINARY SOS: FLUTTERING OVER A MEAL OF QUAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: On the way to Palm Springs we found an exciting Italian restaurant in 
Riverside called Magnone, which I would have expected to find in Beverly Hills. 
They served a marvelous quail stuffed with pancetta and accompanied by polenta 
(cornmeal cakes). I would love to have a recipe for the quail. I hope you can 
get it, as I think other readers would like to know how to prepare quail in 
this delicious manner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- FERN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR FERN: The chef at Magnone graciously sent the recipe. We were delighted to 
find that the stuffing also contains wild rice and juniper berries, which you 
can find in spice sections of most gourmet food stores. The dried berries can 
be left out of the recipe if they are not available. 
</P>
<P>
MAGNONE'S ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
1 cup uncooked wild rice 
</P>
<P>
4 cups veal stock 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup pancetta, diced and lightly cooked 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon juniper berries, crushed 
</P>
<P>
12 small quail 
</P>
<P>
Flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons diced shallots 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces gin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Cook rice in 2 cups veal stock with pancetta and juniper berries until tender 
and liquid is absorbed. Cool rice. Fill quail cavities with 1/4 of rice 
mixture, reserving remaining 3/4 of rice for plates. 
</P>
<P>
Lightly flour quail and cook in olive oil in oven-proof skillet until browned 
on all sides. Pour off excess oil and roast stuffed quail at 450 degrees 10 to 
15 minutes, or until cooked through. 
</P>
<P>
Remove pan from oven and add shallots. Flame with gin. Remove quail to plates 
and add remaining 2 cups veal stock to skillet. Reduce liquid over medium-high 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Add butter, salt and pepper to taste and heat until butter melts and sauce 
thickens slightly. Pour over quail. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I was recently told about an ice cream dessert called Mississippi mud 
pie, but after searching through all my cookbooks, I have been unable to find 
such a dessert. Do you have a recipe in your files? 
</P>
<P>
 -- GINA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR GINA: We have several such recipes in our files. The Chart House, a steak 
house chain, was one of the first restaurants in Southern California to serve 
the pie a decade or so ago. Their recipe is given here. Mud pies make wonderful 
summer desserts because they are cool and can be prepared well in advance to 
keep in the freezer until ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
CHART HOUSE MUD PIE 
</P>
<P>
2/3 (8 1/2-ounce) package dark chocolate wafers 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened 
</P>
<P>
1/2 gallon coffee ice cream, slightly softened 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup Chocolate Fudge Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Whipped cream 
</P>
<P>
Toasted sliced almonds 
</P>
<P>
Crush wafers and mix with butter. Press into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie 
plate. Chill thoroughly or bake at 350 degrees 7 minutes, then chill. 
</P>
<P>
Pack ice cream into chilled crust, shaping into slight mound. Freeze until 
firm. (Freezing before adding fudge sauce is essential to keep fudge from 
slipping off.) 
</P>
<P>
Pour Chocolate Fudge Sauce evenly over pie and freeze until ready to serve. 
Serve with dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with almond slices. Makes 1 
(9-inch) pie. 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Fudge Sauce 
</P>
<P>
5 squares unsweetened Swiss chocolate 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 (5.3-ounce) can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
3 cups powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate and butter in small saucepan. Remove from heat and mix in milk 
alternately with powdered sugar. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring 
constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, stirring, 8 minutes or until thickened and creamy. Remove from heat and 
stir in vanilla. Store in refrigerator and use as needed. Makes 3 cups.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: COOK'S TOUR OF WHAT'S SELLING IN TRADITIONAL, MODERN METAL 
BAKEWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few pieces of banged-up metal bakeware are not an uncommon sight in the 
kitchen. Occasionally, people buy new pans but won't give up scratched, warped 
and rusty tin pans, distorted sheets and jellyroll trays, or corroding and 
grease-stained loaf pans. 
</P>
<P>
True, these metal baking utensils may last for years, but rarely do they look 
new and in perfect shape. Pans made of tinned steel, for instance, darken upon 
constant use but improve baking performance. But it's hard to give up old 
bakeware, particularly if it has served you well. 
</P>
<P>
For cooks pondering the upgrading of pans for new or remodeled kitchens -- or 
for those getting ready for holiday baking -- here's a shopping list of what's 
currently available in the world of metal bakeware: 
</P>
<P>
Shapes and function have not changed much, but modern baking utensils offer new 
finishes or coatings that conduct heat better and prevent sticking. Today, 
you'll find a greater variety of muffin pans, from maxi to mini to micro-mini 
sizes, as well as various types of bread and tart pans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sturdy and Sleek 
</P>
<P>
Ever since it first came out a few years ago, the La Forme selection of 
bakeware from Kaiser has caught my eye for its sturdy look and sleek dark-gray 
finish. Produced in West Germany, the smooth bakeware is made of heavy-gauge 
steel with a double silicon nonstick coating (inside and out) that is lead and 
cadmium free. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is almost three times thicker than other bakeware, La Forme has 
excellent conductivity and produces even heating. When using the pans, it is 
best to check for doneness before the suggested time in the recipe is up 
because the dark pan tends to cook slightly faster than light-colored pans. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the traditional shapes, such as heart, flan and springform pans, 
Kaiser's La Forme includes pans that produce pretty forms in cakes. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-inch round baking pan called Celebration Cake Tin and the Daisy Cake Pan 
have embossed slices and ragged edging. The radiating fanlike effect obtained 
in the finished cake is so attractive that it doesn't need to be frosted or 
decorated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fancy Bread Mold 
</P>
<P>
Another product, called the half-round loaf tin, is a 12-inch-long ribbed mold 
that can be used for making the Austrian rehrucken cake or fancy breads. The 
only drawback with La Forme is that its springform pan with smooth, removable 
base does not have an inner lip. We baked a cheesecake in it beautifully, but 
experienced a slight leaking of the melted butter from the crust while baking. 
</P>
<P>
The newest from La Forme (available by next month) is the La Forme Duo. The 
line includes baking and roasting pans in two sizes -- a large baking sheet and 
a square cake pan. What's attractive and different about these heavy-gauge pans 
is that they are super-glossy and smooth. With a silicate-magnum surface, the 
pans are protected from cutting scratches and acidic foods. 
</P>
<P>
If you insist on having tinned steel because you believe in "the more you use 
it, the better it becomes," Chicago Metallic produces a whole line of 
commercial-weight tinned steel bakeware called Village Baker. The pans season 
with use, meaning the tin and steel fuse and turn bluish-gray. The only 
disadvantage with the tin pans is that they cannot be placed in the dishwasher 
because they rust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perforated Pans 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Metallic offers two new perforated pans that prevent sogginess in baked 
goods: a double French Bread Pan ($17) that is similar to those used by 
commercial bakeries, and a shallow baking tray ($17) for rolls and croissants. 
Another new item from Chicago Metallic is the dishwasher-safe Sure-Bake Cookie 
Sheet ($20), a 16x14-inch baking sheet which is three layers thick. The 
thermal-layered feature insures even baking and prevents burned cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Not new but advantageous for weight watchers is the Village Baker lean meat 
loaf pan set ($9.95). The set consists of two meat-loaf pans; the inner pan is 
lined with holes that allow meat drippings to drain into an outer pan. This is 
also available in SilverStone finish for nonstick baking. 
</P>
<P>
Extremely well-known in Europe, Dr. Oetker products have finally hit the 
culinary shelves of local stores. Distributed by Leifheit of West Germany, Dr. 
Oetker is a bakeware manufacturer that represents three lines: Profi, Tradition 
and Bakita. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Shapes 
</P>
<P>
The top of the line is Profi, a high-grade nonstick-coated group that is 
protected against fruit acids and features a six-year guarantee. Next in line 
is Tradition with its nonstick black coating and three-year guarantee. The 
third group is Bakita in rustproof tin with an electrolytic coating. Like other 
brands, the Dr. Oetker pans offer traditional shapes, including the gugelhupf 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of pewterware in bakeware is captured in Wilton Armetale's 
Lasagna/Open Roaster ($79.95). The 5-quart pan measures 14 1/2x10 1/4x3 1/4 and 
is pretty enough to serve from at the table. Wilton Armetale features excellent 
heat and cold retention. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Metallic Bakeware and Kaiser La Forme Bakeware are available at 
better cookware shops and by telephone order through Chef's Catalog: (800) 
338-3232, and Williams-Sonoma: (415) 421-4242. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilton Armetale Lasagna/Open Roaster soon will be available in department 
stores and specialty cook stores and is presently available by telephone order 
through Chef's Catalog. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Oetker's bakeware are available at Montana Mercantile, Lets Get Cookin' 
(Westlake Village), Barbara's (Ventura) and Ingrid's Gourmet (Ventura).

 THE BUTCHER: A PRIME GATHERING OF MEAT PROCESSORS IN IOWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They came from all over the country -- indeed from around the world -- to Des 
Moines, Iowa, for the 50th anniversary of the American Assn. of Meat Processors 
(AAMP). I have never seen so many butchers in one place at one time in my life. 
There were hundreds of us and you thought we were a vanishing breed. Many 
brought their families: sons and daughters who will almost certainly be the 
ones who do -- if indeed anyone does -- carry on the proud tradition of quality 
custom meat cutting and processing in the country for the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of them brought their hams and bacons, sausage, dried beef, jerky, 
bologna, salami and such to enter in the American Cured Meat Championships. 
Maybe the real reason so many brought the children was to help carry all those 
coolers full of meat products for the competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Old Names 
</P>
<P>
There was not much new in the ham competition; some of the same old names came 
out on top. Burger's Smokehouse in California, Mo.; Wood's Smoked Meats from 
Bowling Green, and Mom 'n Pop's Smoked Meats from Claremont, N.C., took first, 
second and third, respectively, in the smoked country ham category. 
</P>
<P>
Eddy Woods of Wood's Smokehouse and Fred Keller of Mom 'n Pop's no sooner sat 
down with those trophies when they were called back to pick up another first 
and second, respectively, for their unsmoked hams. The three have been winning 
awards regularly throughout the years. For a listing of all this year's winners 
(they mainly sell their products by mail), send a self-addressed stamped 
legal-sized envelope to Cured Meat Champs, P.O. Box 907, Tiburon, Calif. 94920. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most decorated butchers in the world also was in Des Moines for the 
convention. Benito Plasschaert from Ghent, Belgium, a butcher who serves kings 
and queens, brought 13 of his butcher brethren from Holland, Germany, Austria 
and Belgium, along with 126 different specialty meat products from Europe. I 
have never seen such art work in a meat case; pates, terrines and galantines of 
every description; corned beef brisket layered with hazelnuts in forcemeat, 
beautiful and delicious; rolled herb-stuffed bacon slabs wrapped in grape 
leaves unlike anything we have in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit of the latest in meat processing equipment was, as it has been for 
50 years, a part of the convention. This year, they also had an antique 
equipment display. It was interesting to note the basic similarity. We are 
still doing the same things to meat: mincing, chopping, dicing, slicing. The 
only real difference in the process is the power source. What today we do with 
electricity and hydraulics, great-grandad did by hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innovative Packaging 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting and new innovation in meat processing is in the area of 
packaging. It is the new packaging technology that will, I believe, most 
greatly affect the eating habits in the years not far ahead. Indeed, the 
changes have already begun. Packaging exists today that allows the consumer to 
keep meat fresh in the refrigerator for up to 30 days. You can also put the 
same vacuum-packaged meat in the freezer and keep it with no freezer burn and 
no loss of quality almost indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directly to Oven 
</P>
<P>
Packaging also exists today that will go from the freezer directly to the oven 
or microwave and then to the table, saving not only time in the preparation 
process but in cleaning up (there are no extra dishes to do). 
</P>
<P>
It won't be long, according to many speakers at this year's convention, before 
many smaller meat markets will not only offer prepared food to go, but will 
deliver it to the consumer's house. The technology is there, the demand is 
there and this is an area where the little guy can compete with the 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
So, it won't be long before you can keep food fresh almost forever; you can 
have anything you want for dinner delivered to your door; you can cook an 
eight-course dinner in the oven or microwave and not have to do dishes because 
everything comes in disposable containers that are attractive and durable. 
</P>
<P>
I was expressing my wonder at all of this modern technology to one of the food 
scientists in attendance who agreed: "Yes, Merle, we've come a long way in 50 
years, but we've got a long way to go. Most of this new packaging material is 
not biodegradable. What are we going to do with all the empty containers?"

SUMMER PROGRAM EASES STUDENTS' CULTURE SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNELL ALEXANDER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This summer has shown Elizabeth Grounds that her hometown of Barstow, although 
only 120 miles from Los Angeles, seems as far away as a distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
The 20,600 or so inhabitants of her hometown are predominantly white and when 
Grounds, a 17-year-old college freshman, got A's all through Barstow High, she 
did it largely without thinking about people of other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
She had never known any black people. In fact, she had misgivings about even 
approaching them. 
</P>
<P>
Now while taking part in Occidental College's Multi-Cultural Summer Institute 
for incoming freshmen, she's not just approaching blacks, she's attending 
classes with them as well as with Latinos and Asians. She's surprised at what 
she's finding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we're the minority," she said. "It's a different feeling, and it's a 
good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Made up of under-represented minorities and whites from rural backgrounds, the 
summer institute combines writing and American culture courses with workshops 
and field trips for 36 students from around the country who have been accepted 
to the small private university. Students earn credit for the course work. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program, which was first proposed in the early 1980s by 
Occidental's minority caucus, is to acclimate students from diverse backgrounds 
to being on campus and in dorm rooms together. The first summer institute was 
conducted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen who come from rural Alaska and Arkansas and the inner cities of 
Baltimore and Philadelphia are spending five weeks together in classrooms and 
dorms, picking up information in class and out. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them have never even shared a room before, much less shared a room 
with someone who's different than them," said David Morgan, Occidental's 
associate director of admissions and co-director of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Behavioral scientist Ann Schell, an Occidental College faculty member, is 
studying the institute's effectiveness. In her study, she is comparing the 
college performances of past institute participants to those of Occidental 
students who were invited to take part in the institute but did not. 
</P>
<P>
Early and unofficial results indicate that the students who attended the summer 
institute are less likely to drop out of college than those who did not, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that the program may work is that it teaches students to balance 
work and play. The teen-agers are expected to participate in a full slate of 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, students arose early to ride to Tujunga and view its half-mile-long 
historical mural of California. Most of the sleepy students took with them a 
copy of a Flannery O'Connor short story to be discussed in an afternoon class, 
notes on an upcoming lecture or both. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard because it's academically intense, and you're supposed to be social 
at the same time," said Sonya Ramirez, a San Fernando High School graduate. 
</P>
<P>
It takes students time to adjust to the differences between high school and 
college academic work, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
"They hear that it's demanding and hard," said Manuel Pastor, one of three 
teachers of the culture course. "But they have no idea what that means." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important lessons the program has to offer are learned after 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before the chain-link fence separating the students from the mural's 
depiction of scientist Charles Drew in a lab, Kristie Robinson, a black student 
from Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, talked about race relations. 
While she spoke, Elizabeth Grounds, her new friend from Barstow, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were saying there were no blacks in their hometown," said 
Robinson, 18. "I could tell." 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of change in myself," Grounds said, gesturing to Robinson. "Like 
Kristie. Kristie is one of my closest friends. And I never had any black 
friends before." 
</P>
<P>
Kristie rolled her eyes. "I'm a novelty," she said in half jest. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had preconceptions in the past," Grounds said. "And now I see them 
crumbling away."

CROWDING AMONG ISSUES IN LYNWOOD SCHOOL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LYNWOOD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overcrowding, stalled teacher negotiations, low academic achievement and the 
lack of Latino representation may be the key issues in the Lynwood Unified 
School District Board of Education elections in November, in which two 
incumbents face four challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent board members Joe T. Battle and Helen Andersen are being challenged 
by Irma Bass, Margaret Araujo, Rachel Chavez and Cynthia Green-Geter. 
</P>
<P>
All four challengers have raised questions about overcrowded classrooms. The 
state recently withheld $360,000 from the 13,800-student district because it 
placed students in overcrowded classrooms rather than hiring additional 
teachers or substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Both Green-Geter and Araujo say they are concerned about the failure of 
teachers and the administration to agree on a labor contract. Teachers have 
worked without one since June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The district's academic standards have been called into question by Chavez and 
Green-Geter. Students have shown some improvement in state reading and 
mathematics scores, but they rank well below statewide averages on the 
California Assessment Program tests. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez raised the issue of Latino representation on the board. More than 70% of 
the students are Latino, but there are no Latinos on the five-member board, 
which has two blacks and three whites. 
</P>
<P>
While the six candidates agree that the district is severely overcrowded, the 
two incumbents dispute the state's $360,000 penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"We were honest, while other districts do not report that students are placed 
in overcrowded classrooms when teachers are absent and subs can't be found," 
Battle said. 
</P>
<P>
Battle, 47, is seeking his third four-year term on the board. A retired Army 
sergeant, Battle is a field service representative for the U.S. Treasury 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
He has a bachelor's degree in business administration from Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen said the penalty "was one of those unfortunate things," but the 
district will take steps to correct the situation, including hiring more 
teachers before the start of school and offering substitutes more money. 
</P>
<P>
Green-Geter said overcrowded conditions would be relieved if the district built 
a high school. The district received $34 million for a new high school in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of building the new high school with the $34 million in state funds, 
the board has engaged in long and laborious litigation," said Green-Geter, a 
unsuccessful candidate for a board seat in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been involved in a court fight over the price of the land it 
condemned for a high school site. 
</P>
<P>
Battle said he believes that a settlement will be reached early next year that 
would allow construction of the school and relieve overcrowding at the 
district's only high school. It was built to house 1,000, but it now has more 
than 3,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding Issue 
</P>
<P>
Bass said she also considers the No. 1 issue to be student overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the school board was able to (vote to construct) a new 
administration building and was not able to build the new high school," Bass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The board recently voted to construct the administration building for an 
estimated cost of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"As a parent, I believe I should be on the board to see what's going on," said 
Bass, who has two daughters attending Lynwood High School. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue for challenger Chavez is the lack of Latino representation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for Latinos to be represented because of the numbers and need. It is 
time for us to take command of our future," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years in a district where the Latino student population has 
doubled, Chavez said, there is a need for a Latino board member. Robert 
Cisneros, a Latino, served on the board from 1975 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino student population jumped from nearly 5,000 during 1979-80 to almost 
10,000 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
A Latino would be sensitive to the educational needs of Latino students, many 
of whom speak limited English, said Chavez, a unsuccessful board candidate in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez finished fourth among eight candidates competing for three seats. Chavez 
lost by only five votes to the third-place winner, Thelma Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Battle said he considers himself sensitive to the needs of the Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
"I will leave it up to the electorate to decide who should be on the board," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen said she also is sensitive and responsive to the Latino students 
educational needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I attend the advisory meetings of the Latino parents. I listen to their 
concerns and act on them," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a problem with the Latino parents," added Andersen, who operates 
an income tax business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said she withdrew her 10-year-old from the district last year and sent 
her to a private school in nearby South Gate to protest what she sees as low 
quality of education in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm protesting the poor writing assignments and the (lack of) exposure to good 
literature," said Chavez, a graduate of Whittier College with a degree in 
sociology. A homemaker, Chavez, 51, has been employed in the past as a social 
worker for the county of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Battle said while the academic scores are low, the district has laid the ground 
work for improvement in academics. He said a pilot project based on a 
successful program in the schools in St. Louis will be included in the Lynwood 
curriculum when school starts next month. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible key issue, said Green-Geter, is low teacher morale caused by 
the unsettled labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale is unbelieveably low. Teachers do not want to come back to school in 
September because the district refuses to settle with them" Green-Geter said. 
</P>
<P>
Battle said he believed that the two sides were close to settling but the 
teachers decided to hold out for more money when the Los Angeles school 
district recently gave its teachers a new contract that will raise wages 24% by 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood teachers in July rejected a district offer of a three-year contract 
with a 4% increase the first year. The two sides are in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the labor dispute and the overcrowded conditions, Araujo charged 
that "teachers are leaving the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Morale is very low because of the pay." Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
Araujo, 42, ran for the board in 1987. She is employed at Lynwood High School 
as a community aide in the district's dropout prevention program.

CONEJO GRADE'S GREAT DIVIDE GROWING SMALLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people look at the Conejo Grade and see an "Iron Curtain" that separates 
east Ventura County from the west. 
</P>
<P>
Others see a 700-foot hump that they ascend daily with little problem and less 
pondering. 
</P>
<P>
Still others say the hill once divided cowboys from suburban slickers, but its 
psychological importance is crumbling as residents on both sides grapple with 
countywide problems such as traffic, smog and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Like a gigantic Rorschach test inkblot, the Conejo Grade is perceived 
differently -- depending on whether you're a retailer, housewife or Camarillo 
teen-ager with an unreliable car and a girlfriend in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
But most folks do agree that when you cross the Conejo Grade, you've really 
gone somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly an event," said Dick Faussett, vice president of TOLD Corp., a 
developer based in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a point of departure," said Dave Robertson, an administrative analyst for 
Ventura County who lives in Thousand Oaks. "You crest the grade on a clear day, 
and you see the whole Oxnard Plain dropping off into the ocean. Then it 
literally disappears from sight and from mind somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers, politicians, developers and others with their eye on the county say 
that east county residents identify more with Los Angeles than coastal Ventura. 
Many still work in the greater metropolitan area and have moved to the 
affluent, master-planned communities of eastern Ventura County within the past 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, they say many residents of Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo are proud of 
their coastal or rural roots and share a distaste for the urban jungle of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We stay out of there as much as we can," said Edwin Jewett, a 79-year-old from 
a longtime Ventura farming family who recalls driving his Model T Ford into Los 
Angeles for occasional sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, "when you came back over the grade into Camarillo at night, you 
could only see two or three lights shining." Today, Jewett said, "the whole 
valley is lit up with lights, lights everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stereotypes Miss Point 
</P>
<P>
But though there are still plenty of west-end ranchers tooling along in pickup 
trucks and east-end yuppies zipping around in BMWs, longtime observers caution 
against stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
"Those differences are being erased quickly," says Richard Wittenberg, the 
county's chief administrative officer. "There's more of a homogeneity, more of 
a community feeling countywide." 
</P>
<P>
And longtime perceptions of sophistication on the east end and homespun 
simplicity on the west are false, many say. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to a charity party in Ventura, and the men are wearing their own tuxes 
and the women are elegantly dressed," said one person who attends many such 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the difference between old money and new money," she said. "One is pretty 
flashy and the other one isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Most people agree that west Ventura County has pockets of wealth in Ojai, 
Channel Islands Harbor and Ventura, as well as pockets of poverty. In the east 
end, by contrast, the wealth is distributed more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Such demographics are why an upscale mall probably won't open in Ventura County 
for another five years or more, according to Barbara Teuscher, general manager 
of the Thousand Oaks shopping center known as the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
A study commissioned by the Oaks found that the average household income in the 
Thousand Oaks area was $49,251; the Ventura area lagged with $38,170. About 64% 
of the east-end population worked as professionals, compared to 36% in the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
"Your white-collar executive or middle manager, who is the dominant force in 
the Conejo Valley, buys more suits and dressy clothing, which is what shopping 
centers thrive on. . . . The white-collar worker may own a house with a 
swimming pool, even a boat, but he certainly isn't towing it around -- he's 
mooring it somewhere," Teuscher said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, "your blue-collar worker is going to buy more jeans and casual 
apparel. He's going to be driving a four-wheel-drive and towing a boat or a 
camper shell." 
</P>
<P>
One progressive business that flopped in Ventura was a natural food 
supermarket. Owner Jim Hagen, who still runs a Santa Barbara store called Hope 
&amp; Hagen, says he sold his Ventura store in 1987 because it was a "marginal 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura clientele "is very much your meat-and-potatoes crowd," Hagen said. 
By contrast, a Los Angeles-based health-food market called Mrs. Gooch's is 
moving into Thousand Oaks in October, and Hagen said he would also consider 
opening a store there. 
</P>
<P>
But others bridle at such glib characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Have the Base' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's accurate to say we don't have high demographics. We have 
the base here, but nobody knows it yet," said Wendy Wallace, a leasing 
administrator for Oxnard Financial Plaza, which does not include high-end 
department stores such as Nordstrom's. 
</P>
<P>
Such distinctions were unknown 200 years ago, when the Conejo Grade was a trade 
route favored by coastal and inland Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the hills were rife with Conejo buckwheat, whose yellowish-green 
blossom is the official flower of Thousand Oaks. There were also prickly pears 
and beaver tail cacti poking up from the layer of dirt that covered the granite 
hills, formed more than 15 million years ago by uprisings of volcanic rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians knew every promontory on those hills, every granite cranny. 
</P>
<P>
They even drew a pictograph on a cave wall along the grade depicting an ancient 
boating accident. The painting showed a canoe hitting a rock, Indians flying 
out of the craft, and various ocean symbols, according to Thomas Maxwell, an 
author and expert on the Conejo Grade who lives in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
But the painting is now buried under 30 tons of rocks, a victim of 20th-Century 
road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In his historical novel "The Temescals of Arroyo Conejo," Maxwell chose the 
Conejo Grade as the place where the Chumash Indians first meet Spanish 
explorers. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that really happened is conjecture, Maxwell says. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike such natural wonders as the Pacific Ocean, the Conejo Grade rarely 
causes poets to wax lyrical or folk singers to break into song. 
</P>
<P>
But the Conejo Grade has its chroniclers nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The first recorded sighting of the grade comes from Father Pedro Font, a member 
of the Anza Expedition, which brought mule-trains of settlers from Mexico. Font 
and his party trekked over the Conejo Grade on their way north to San Francisco 
on Feb. 23, 1776, says Ventura County historian Judith Triem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Chronicle 
</P>
<P>
According to Font's diary entry that day: 
</P>
<P>
"The road in parts is level, and in parts one goes up and down the ridges until 
one reaches the long grade, from which one sees the sea and the first islands 
of the channel of Santa Barbara. Descending this ridge . . . one finishes 
crossing the range which extends from the Sierra Madre and ends at the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"Then one enters a plain extending more than five leagues to the (Santa Clara) 
river and beyond. The range has many . . . live oaks and other trees, and 
likewise some watering places. . . . In it, we saw four small (Indian) 
villages." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Allen continues the Font saga in her history of the Conejo Valley: 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the women, frightened at the severe grade, dismounted and made their 
way down the rugged mountain on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Font complained bitterly about the California fleas, which were plentiful 
everywhere but especially on the Conejo mountain. Here, 'they were so bad that 
whenever we halted everything was alive with them, and very hungry ones. No 
country is without its plague, and that one has the plague of fleas,' " Allen 
quoted Font as writing. 
</P>
<P>
Folklore holds that if you look at the mountains on the north side of the 
Conejo Grade, you can make out a face resembling Abraham Lincoln's. The face is 
also said to depict a legendary Chumash Indian called Running Antelope, 
according to Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
During the Mission period, Spanish soldiers, padres and settlers passed over 
the grade on their way north or south. Later, farmers drove teams of 10 horses 
over the grade, hauling surplus grain to the wharf at Port Hueneme for boat 
shipment to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The road was very narrow and rutted then, full of hairpin turns -- 49 by one 
historical account -- and quite steep. Wagons were emptied of as much weight as 
possible on the way up, and stagecoach passengers were required to walk up the 
grade to spare the horses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Union Hotel 
</P>
<P>
In 1876, James Hammell built the two-story Grand Union Hotel at the grade's 
eastern foot to serve as a stagecoach stop and health resort. 
</P>
<P>
Later renamed the Stagecoach Inn, it was the midway point between Ventura and 
Los Angeles and favored by travelers spending the night. Today it has been 
renovated as the Stagecoach Inn Museum and is listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
In the last part of the 19th Century, would-be county politicians seized on the 
winding dirt road and made paving and widening it part of their election 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, many thought U.S. 101 would be routed through Simi Valley, 
according to Crane S. Miller's account in the Ventura County Historical Society 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
Money was appropriated for improvements to the Conejo Grade in the early 20th 
Century, but the contractor went broke before he finished. Eventually, Joe 
Russell, who owned what is now Westlake, raised $1,800 from his farmer friends, 
and the two-lane road was completed in the 1920s, Triem said. 
</P>
<P>
The road has undergone several expansions since then -- most recently in 1987, 
when it was widened from five lanes to six. But despite its sleek appearance, 
old-timers still talk about it with trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to scare me going over it. There was always a lot of fog. . . . With 
the hairpin turns, you had to slow down to 15 miles per hour," recalled David 
Hill, now a docent at the Ventura County Historical Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Faussett grew up in Thousand Oaks and remembers that his 1941 Ford hot rod 
would overheat on the long climb. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer, I couldn't date anyone from Thousand Oaks," Faussett said. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the differences on either side still stand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Markets 
</P>
<P>
Tom Schlender, who owns stores in Newbury Park and Oxnard that sell major 
appliances, maintains that he must market his wares differently in the two 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
His Warehouse Discount Center in Newbury Park has high-tech stock; the Oxnard 
appliances come with fewer gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
"In Newbury Park, we'd sell a stove with a microwave and self-cleaning oven, 
where in Oxnard it would be your basic range. We've tried a higher end in 
Oxnard and it wasn't as successful," Schlender said. 
</P>
<P>
But distinctions are blurring. 
</P>
<P>
Faussett, who serves on the board of the Ventura County Economic Development 
Assn. and speaks to groups throughout the county, said civic leaders from Simi 
Valley to Oxnard are concerned about problems such as smog, traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides share the same concerns. We have fairly common problems." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the growing awareness is that more and more people commute over 
the grade -- an increasing number of them from Moorpark and Thousand Oaks into 
the growing industrial and commercial office base of western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
And an entire new community has sprung up in the past several years on the 
grade's Camarillo flank. About 700 homes and apartments are in various stages 
of construction, plus two retail or office parks and an 18-hole golf course, 
according to a spokesman for the city planner's office in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who represents cities on 
both sides of the grade, best sums up the dichotomy of this enigmatic 15 miles 
of highway. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, she said, "I find they're very similar both politically and 
philosophically. I know some very urbane folks in both neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
But in the same breath, she only underscored the different perceptions on both 
sides when she added: "If each side crossed the grade, they'd be absolutely 
amazed at the similarity."

MATRIMONY AT THE MALL IS FOR REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people go to the mall to exchange an impossible tie for a passable shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But last weekend, Vinicia M. Bruce and Laurence S. Adler went to the mall to 
exchange the vows of marriage -- for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in 
health, from New Year's Day white sales to post-Christmas bargain specials. 
</P>
<P>
Before about 150 shoppers toting bags and reining in unruly children at the 
Janss Mall in Thousand Oaks, the couple agreed on Saturday to "love and 
cherish" one another "from this day forward." 
</P>
<P>
The Adlers then danced in front of an athletic-shoe store to music from a 
portable public address system and served wedding cake next to a pet store in 
the midst of a sidewalk sale on dog food. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in California," observed David Bee, a financial planner who attended the 
wedding as a friend of the groom's family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers Attended 
</P>
<P>
Adler, 26, said the event allowed customers of the hamburger stand he manages 
in the mall to attend. "This way, everybody gets to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His 22-year-old bride acknowledged that the idea at first left her cold. "I 
just thought it was kind of weird," she said. "I always thought it would be a 
little get-together with a few friends and family, not in a mall with millions 
of people." 
</P>
<P>
The groom's family appeared to take the arrangement in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy, they're happy and that's what's important," said the groom's 
father, Steve Adler, a salesman who had flown in from Parsippany, N. J., for 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The bride's mother, Sally Maynard, was more pragmatic. Maynard, a school-bus 
driver in Fontana, said local merchants donated more than $4,000 in goods and 
services for the event. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding's decidedly nondenominational location also solved the nettlesome 
problem of uniting two families of mixed faiths. Adler and his family are 
Jewish; the bride and her family are Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't any different than getting married at Raging Waters," Maynard said, 
referring to a recent ceremony at the San Dimas amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all its liberties with convention, the double-ring ceremony dripped 
with tradition. The bride, an accounting assistant for a Ventura company, wore 
a full-length, white lace gown with a flowing veil, while the groom sported not 
just a tuxedo but a walking stick and top hat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tug at Heartstrings 
</P>
<P>
And the display appeared to tug as much at heartstrings as any conventional 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
A resounding "Aaaaaahhhhh" rose from the crowd when Adler hugged the bride's 
5-year-old daughter, Patty Jo, after exchanging vows and a gold ring with her 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm marrying them both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mood infected Billie Buzan, a retired telephone operator who was helping a 
friend pick out a handset at the Phone Mart when the activities began. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something about a wedding even if you don't know the couple," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the wedding's guests happened upon the event just as Buzan did, 
many said they had seen newspaper announcements about it and decided to pay 
their respects to, in the words of one onlooker, "that nice young man at 
Frank's Charbroiler." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know him," said Doris Solway, a retired hospital worker from Thousand 
Oaks who said she planned to send the couple a card and a check. "But you get 
good vibes. He's polite. He's courteous." 
</P>
<P>
An affable fellow who urged his customers to sign the guest book and offered 
cake to passers-by, Adler presides over a coffee klatch of Thousand Oaks 
merchants who meet every morning in front of his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mini-Mayor' 
</P>
<P>
"They call him 'the mini-mayor of Thousand Oaks,' " said his mother, Lois 
Sandmeier, a sales manager for a Woodland Hills caterer. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Fieweger, a klatch regular and the operator of a stationery store in the 
mall, suggested the wedding. "Originally, they were going to run off to Vegas 
and I thought, 'Shoot, that's cold,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The event realized a dream that Fieweger had entertained for 20 years, he said. 
But it does nothing to satisfy a fantasy that came to him after visiting a 
local rest home filled with "90-year-olds who hadn't had any attention in their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted a funeral in the mall," Fieweger said. "If nobody'll recognize 
'em, we will."

COMPTON REBUFFS MOVE TO BUILD TOWNHOUSES ON PART OF AUTO PLAZA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council Tuesday told its Redevelopment Agency staff to begin 
soliciting commercial development proposals for the Compton Auto Plaza, 
rebuffing the pleas of a clergy-led community group that wants to build 
low-cost, owner-occupied townhouses on a portion of the 55-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a cold shoulder at the council work session held to discuss 
development options for the land, leaders of the South Central Organizing 
Committee (SCOC) vowed to gather 20,000 signatures on petitions in order "to 
tell the council what the people of Compton want." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Surrender Dream 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to give up this dream," the Rev. Reuben Anderson told about 40 
people from SCOC who attended the workshop. "We need to make the council 
responsive to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the steps outside the council chambers, Anderson and other clergy 
leaders drew laughter from the crowd by making light of the city's attempts to 
lure car dealers, shopping center developers and other commercial concerns to 
the site. Nobody, the clergymen said, wants to come to the city, which is 
steeped in crime and poverty, until "we straighten up Compton." 
</P>
<P>
SCOC is arguing that its low-cost housing proposal would help stabilize the 
city. The organization is proposing construction of as many as 600 townhouses 
that would sell for about $60,000 to working-class families with annual incomes 
of up to $26,000. Two religious denominations have already pledged to raise $8 
million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
City officials argue that the community ought to hold to its original plan for 
the site, which lies against the north side of the Artesia Freeway at the 
Alameda Street off-ramp, a short distance from the Harbor and Long Beach 
freeways. The land is zoned for commercial development and city officials say 
they still believe such development would provide jobs for its unemployed young 
people and generate much-needed sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment manager Cynthia Coleman said SCOC, which has never presented a 
formal proposal for the housing development, is allowed like any other group to 
submit a development plan to the city. 
</P>
<P>
But only one council member, Bernice Woods, has expressed an interest in 
discussing the housing proposal further. Woods suggested that another workshop 
be held to discuss SCOC's ideas. The council, though, did not set a date for 
such a workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Many city officials have said they do not believe it would be in the city's 
best interests to approve housing on what they view as a valuable piece of 
commercial land. Councilman Maxcy Filer said the city sold bonds to buy, clear 
and improve the land for commercial development and that the bondholders expect 
commercial development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 Possible Configurations 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment staff, meanwhile, presented to the council six different 
possible development configurations for the site. Council members said they 
want to begin reviewing proposals from developers, as well as marketing studies 
now under way, as soon as possible to determine what should be built on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The six development options presented by the redevelopment staff were: 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealerships, a shopping center and a hotel, which is already on the 
southwest corner of the site but has yet to open. The redevelopment staff 
described this as the "safest" option because it would concentrate on auto 
dealers and shopping center developers who have approached the city about 
locating there. 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealerships, the hotel and an entertainment center that would include 
restaurants and theaters. This was deemed "supportive" of the hotel, which the 
city is hoping will lure convention business. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel and shopping and entertainment centers. Auto dealerships would be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel and shopping center, eliminating auto dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel, shopping center and internationally recognized electronics manufacturers 
that would sell both retail and wholesale. At this time, the staff said, the 
option is "very adventuresome" because the city does not know if electronics 
firms would want to locate there. Marketing studies are under way to determine 
if the idea is feasible, staff said. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel, electronics manufacturers and entertainment center. Studies indicate 
this mix would be the "most supportive" of the hotel. Staff said it is also the 
most "risk-filled" option because the city would have to find manufacturers and 
entertainment firms interested in locating there. 
</P>
<P>
Though the site is known as the Compton Auto Plaza, the city acknowledged years 
ago that its fledgling auto mall would never rival in size or tax revenues the 
malls in other cities such as Cerritos. Only one dealer is in business now, but 
the city's redevelopment staff says it has proposals from six other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
A Mack Truck franchise has been pressing the city for weeks to be allowed to 
buy the old Brett Mitchell Chevrolet dealership in the mall so the franchise 
can close its Signal Hill and Los Angeles locations and relocate in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The city, however, is mired in a legal fight with Mitchell over title to the 
land and wants the truck firm to consider another parcel farther from the new 
hotel. The hotel itself has had a fitful history. Originally scheduled to open 
in May, 1988, the developer missed another anticipated opening date last week. 
The latest opening date has been set for October, barring any more construction 
delays or financial problems for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Beach shopping center developer has been waiting since April for the 
city to decide if it would set aside 25 acres for a shopping center. According 
to the staff, such a development could generate up to $100 million in sales 
annually and employ 150 to 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever development option is chosen for the land, the council has made it 
clear that developers will pay their way this time. Many residents have 
complained that in the past the city gave too much in the way of selling land 
at discount rates or prices to businesses that later failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It just isn't Christmas time as far as I see it," said Councilman Filer. "As 
far as I'm concerned, if (developers) bring nothing to the table, then don't 
bother to come to the table."

NEW RADIO NETWORK TO KEEP SCHOOLS IN TOUCH IN EVENT OF EMERGENCY

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the early-morning earthquake rocked the Los Angeles Basin on Oct. 1, 
1987, frightened students and teachers gathered on the football field at 
Montebello Intermediate School and waited for further instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked out there with 500 kids waiting," remembers Darline Robles, who was 
principal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines were down for three hours, and the school was cut off from the 
district office until maintenance workers were sent out with two-way radios, 
Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some buildings were damaged and aftershocks prevented students and 
staff from entering other buildings, school could not be called off without 
approval of district officials, Robles said. Officials eventually went from 
school to school to assess damage and determine whether to send students home. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the Montebello Unified School District purchased a new 
two-way radio system designed to prevent much of the confusion that occurred 
during the 1987 quake, said Robles, who now is the district's assistant 
superintendent for pupil and community services. 
</P>
<P>
The new system will allow school officials to switch to a clear channel to 
discuss injuries and damages with district officials and emergency centers. And 
district officials will be able to relay their decisions, such as whether to 
close a school. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the district office) had no way of supporting us," Robles said. "Now 
there will be a sense of security with people that can help us." 
</P>
<P>
The development of a communications system was listed as the top priority by a 
district earthquake preparedness committee that was formed after the 1987 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's report to the Montebello Board of Education said a new system 
was necessary "because of the confusion, the rumors and not being able to get 
in touch with the district during the quake," said Janet Myers, assistant to 
Robles. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education in July, 1988, approved a $200,000 disaster plan that 
included $60,000 for a new emergency communications system linking all schools 
to the district office, the county office of education in Downey -- command 
center for county schools -- and eventually to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department emergency operations center. New equipment arrived recently, and 
employees will begin training next month, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
The county education office has installed a more powerful system that allows 
participants to switch to clear channels during emergencies, said Charles 
Devlin, who oversees the office's communications network. Previously, the 
office was using one channel to keep in touch with 400 buses. "It's like having 
400 buses on a single party (telephone) line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Montebello district is the first to join the county education office's 
emergency system, Devlin said. Other school districts such as Long Beach have 
compatible radio equipment and could easily be connected, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Starkey, maintenance manager for Long Beach Unified, said his district is 
planning to join the emergency network in three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
The radio network has the capacity to handle every school district in the 
county, Devlin said, and several districts have expressed an interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier City School District recently installed a $25,000 two-way radio 
system and may also join. "We are going to check with them to find out if our 
equipment can be used to tie in with the county," Supt. Neil Avery said.

NEW LAW WILL BLOCK STREETS, BAN LOITERING IN BIXBY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council has passed an ordinance to close off through 
streets in Bixby Park and make overnight loitering illegal in the area that has 
been plagued by crime and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the police and city traffic engineer are authorized to erect 
barricades on 1st and 2nd streets between Cherry and Junipero avenues from 10 
p.m. to 5 a.m. The law is aimed at preventing crusing through the park. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the council passed a related measure that bans loitering in the park 
between midnight and 5 a.m., except for anyone attending an activity or program 
for which a city permit has been obtained. 
</P>
<P>
The area has become known as a trouble spot for homosexual prostitution and 
assorted other problems.

COUNCILMAN TO MEET WITH NEIGHBORS OF NURSERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Les Robbins plans to meet with Stevely Avenue residents in east 
Long Beach this weekend to air complaints of pesticide over-spraying, dust and 
other problems associated with a large commercial nursery operation. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins delayed for two weeks a move to ask the City Council to send a letter 
to Sunrise Grower's landlord, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
asking for their removal from the power line right of way near Carson Street. 
</P>
<P>
The growers maintain that their operations are perfectly legal, a contention 
supported by Los Angeles County health and agricultural officials. But Robbins 
said that residents want the operation removed because it is near their back 
yards.

CHANGE IN EMISSION RULES ASKED FOR TRASH INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach needs to change the operation rules for its trash incineration plant 
or face continued violations for nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of 
smog, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has asked the South Coast Air Quality Management District to change 
its rules so that nitrogen oxide emissions from the Southeast Resource Recovery 
Facility will be averaged over an hour instead of every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That way, the city could avoid being cited or fined for occasional short 
durations of nitrogen oxide emissions because plant operators would have a 
longer period to return the plant to normal operations, city Solid Waste 
Manager Bill Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Davis told the City Council, the plant is expected to exceed its 
maximum allowable output of nitrogen oxide about once every 10 days. The 
builder of the plant, Dravo Corp., could be held financially liable if the 
plant fails to meet pollution standards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech plant on Terminal Island burns trash to produce electricity. 
Council members hailed the $100-million plant as helping protect the city from 
a landfill crisis that is expected to affect all cities in Southern California 
over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the bursts of nitrogen oxide are produced by surges of temperature 
in the plant's furnace. Also, the plant's nitrogen oxide emissions rise when it 
burns nitrogen-rich grass clippings or tree trimmings.

AGENT MUST PAY $1 MILLION TO SENIORS FOR ABORTED TOURS TO ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A travel agent has been ordered to pay $1 million in restitution and damages to 
a group of senior citizens who paid him for tours to Soviet Armenia that never 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Superior Court Judge Stephen E. O'Neill last week ordered Wartkes 
Krikor Nazarian, 58, owner of the Vart Travel Agency, to pay the money to 51 
senior citizens who bought package tours to the Armenian Soviet Socialist 
Republic. The tours were postponed three times before Nazarian told the senior 
citizens that he could not arrange the trips. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate court action against Nazarian in March, he pleaded guilty to 
charges of felony grand theft in connection with the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to five years probation by a Pasadena Superior Court judge and 
ordered to pay $62,950 in restitution to the senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The senior citizens, members of the Glendale-based Armenian Council on Aging, 
paid an average of $1,250 each for the tours in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The tours were to include air fare, ground transportation and hotel 
accommodations in the southern Soviet Republic. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing the senior citizens, Rafi Ourfalian, said after the 
trial that the judgment was "a long-sought vindication for the Armenian 
American Council on Aging and its members." 
</P>
<P>
Nazarian refused comment on the outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
At last Wednesday's trial, five people testified that they bought tours to 
Soviet Armenia through Nazarian but never saw their homeland or their money. 
</P>
<P>
The victims testified that they spent their savings on the trips, which were to 
have been a pilgrimage to the country where many of them were born. 
</P>
<P>
"All our lives we have been dreaming about seeing our motherland," said Hevach 
Khachatoonian, who paid Nazarian for tours for himself and his wife. "This 
Nazarian has caused so much anguish and mental cruelty to the entire group. It 
was an ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
The money awarded to the plaintiffs was about $200,000 more than the $712,950 
they had sought.

ECHO PARK LIBRARY SITE TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A community meeting to discuss sites for the new Echo Park Library is scheduled 
for 2 p.m. Saturday at the library, 515 N. Levita Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Friends of the Echo Park Library, the meeting's sponsor, want 
the new facility to be at a fire station soon to be vacated by the Los Angeles 
Fire Department, said spokeswoman Karen Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
However, library officials are not considering the station at 534 E. Edgeware 
Road as a possible site. Jaeger said the meeting is being held in an attempt to 
find alternate sites for the building. 
</P>
<P>
The library has occupied a temporary site on Levita Terrace since 1971. About 
$5.5 million was allocated for a new branch last spring after voters approved a 
citywide library bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger said city officials have been invited to the meeting. The library serves 
more than 5,000 people, she said.

OXNARD CITIZENS GROUP TO WEIGH TAX INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council decided this week to form a citizens advisory group to 
consider the possibility of raising taxes to make up for an anticipated 
shortage in revenues that could climb as high as $4 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which will consist of 27 Oxnard residents, is expected to be in 
place by Sept. 19, but will not be expected to hand down a recommendation until 
January, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest that any such increase could come before voters in a regular 
election, which is less expensive than a special election and usually has a 
higher voter turnout, would be June, 1990, when the gubernatorial primary will 
be held, said City Clerk Mabi Plisky. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the city's latest response to a revenue shortfall that is 
anticipated to reach $2.7 million on this year's $57.5-million budget. To 
bridge the gap, the City Council has already decided to cut such city services 
as street maintenance and to postpone replacing city employees who quit or 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Tax Increases 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a possible tax increase, the committee will study several other 
steps aimed at increasing revenues. 
</P>
<P>
They include withholding the portion of sales taxes that Oxnard gives the 
county, raising fees that utility companies pay to use the city's roads, 
calling due a $3.1-million loan to Oxnard's Redevelopment Agency and 
establishing assessment districts for the maintenance of street lighting, city 
trees and road medians. 
</P>
<P>
A task force of eight city officials that has drafted the list of options 
considered turning over upkeep of sidewalks and street trees to residents, but 
ruled out that option. 
</P>
<P>
"True, someone could cut up their tree and save the city money, but it might 
not be up to the city's standards," said Rudy Muravez, the city's finance and 
management services director, who served as chairman of the city's Revenue 
Enhancement Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selection Process 
</P>
<P>
Also at Tuesday's meeting, council members endorsed an elaborate selection 
process aimed at preserving the new committee's independence. 
</P>
<P>
They decided to include a representative appointed by each of eight key civic 
groups and by the city's two major private employers, St. John's Regional 
Medical Center and ABEX, an aerospace firm. In addition, each of the council's 
five members will nominate six members, for a total of 30, but only 15 will be 
selected at random to serve on the board. Council members Geraldine Furr and 
Dorothy Maron, who have served since January on the Revenue Enhancement Task 
Force, will also serve on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make it clear that this isn't a rubber-stamp committee with a 
preconceived agenda," Muravez said. "The introduction of a tax would require 
the approval of the voters and the support of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Muravez estimated that the city could raise between $100,000 and $5 million 
each year by increasing taxes in any of six ways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choice of Methods 
</P>
<P>
The committee will study increases in the city's 9% transient-occupancy tax, 
which is paid by guests at local hotels and motels; its business licenses, 
which already generate $1.4 million, and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also will be asked to consider establishing an admission tax on 
tickets to entertainment events in Oxnard and a special tax for police and fire 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The committee may also revive an unpopular tax on utility bills that was phased 
out in 1986. The reintroduction of the tax, whose early eclipse has been blamed 
for part of the city's current financial crunch, could raise up to $1 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the city's portion of drunk driving fines to the county, which uses 
them to finance a probation program, and the loss of federal revenue sharing 
have also been held responsible as causes of the shortfall.

COOKIE-CRAZED PIGS STILL THE FAVORITES AT FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you haven't made it to the fair, you've only got four days left. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fair promises something for everyone -- from the usual 
stockpile of fuzzy animals, prize begonias and carnival rides to the stranger, 
but ever-popular pig races, where four of the enthusiastic little porkers huff 
and puff their way to the ribbon for the fair's lavish purse: an Oreo cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"The people love the pig races," fair general manager Jeremy Ferris said. "They 
come out and cheer for their favorite pig and wave the racing silks around. 
It's quite an event." 
</P>
<P>
Whether people have been drawn by the scampering swine or the old fair staples 
of rides, entertainment and displays, attendance at the halfway point was up 
from about 125,000 last year to 142,000 this year, fair spokeswoman Teri Raley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said a possible reason for the upswing may be that fair-goers are slowly 
but surely becoming accustomed to attending the fair in the summer instead of 
the fall. Until 1986, the fair was held in October. 
</P>
<P>
Some remaining fair attractions include the Flying U Rodeo at 8 p.m. Friday and 
4 p.m. Saturday; a Junior Livestock Auction throughout Friday; a draft, 
carriage and Frisian horse show from 5:30 to 9 p.m. Friday, 1 to 4 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday; the 10th annual Ventura County Fair Chili Cook-Off at 3:15 
p.m. Saturday; the Great Lemon Pie Grand Bake-Off at 1 p.m. Saturday, and the 
Desert Rose Band opening for the Oak Ridge Boys at 8 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more offbeat activities slated to close out the fair include the 
pig races at 1, 3, 5 and 7 p.m. today and Friday in a special arena just past 
Uncle Leo's Barnyard; a hog-calling contest at 7 tonight; a paper airplane toss 
at 3 p.m. Saturday and a banana-eating contest at 4 p.m. Sunday.

TRAIN DERAILMENT CAUSES SHAKING LIKE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crews finished working Wednesday to restore cars and cargo on a freight train 
that derailed Monday in Downey, tearing up about 1,100 feet of track and tying 
up street traffic at some intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Pacific freight was loaded with 95 units of double-stacked 
shipping containers when it rolled off the tracks about 4:20 p.m. near Burns 
and Rives avenues. The weight and speed of the train caused a rumbling and 
rattling that shook nearby buildings much like an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the ground shook hard, railroad ties were snapped like 
toothpicks and sparks were flying as pieces of metal were torn loose. 
</P>
<P>
Small fires broke out along the tracks, but they were quickly doused by the 
Downey Fire Department, spokeswoman Sharon Crook said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters at first believed the rail cars may have been carrying hazardous 
materials, and started to evacuate residents in a nearby apartment complex. The 
evacuation was halted about 15 minutes later, however, when the train's 
conductor assured firemen that the cargo was not hazardous. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the derailment was a faulty metal cross brace on one stack car, 
according to Bob Hoppe, spokesman for Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 
Los Angeles. When the brace failed it caused downward pressure on the bottom of 
the car, pushing the wheels apart and spreading the rails. The cars behind 
simply rolled off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Hoppe said the track was expected to be repaired and reopened for service by 
early Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The train was made up of 19 articulated cars, each of which had five attached 
units holding containers stacked two high. Four cars or 20 units were derailed, 
Hoppe said. The train originated at the Long Beach Harbor intermodal container 
terminal and was bound for the East Coast.

BONETTO PLAYS HARDBALL IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Bonetto stepped through the door and a hush quickly fell over the room. All 
eyes turned in his direction. Normally, the ability to dominate a social 
gathering simply by walking into a room would be a dream come true for a single 
college student. 
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't the lounge at the Hard Rock Cafe. It was a hotel bar in 
Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, and under the circumstances, Bonetto would 
have preferred to remain anonymous, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I looked like a CIA agent," said Bonetto, whose close-cropped 
hair, jutting chin and aviator sunglasses give him that popular Highway Patrol 
look. "I really stood out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, the initials CIA are about as popular as the initials IRS are to 
Leona Helmsley. All of which gave Bonetto serious cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
But his goal in Nicaragua involved toppling an institution much more ingrained 
than the Sandinista-led government. Instead of bumping off a politician, 
Bonetto's mission was to knock off Nicaragua's national baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
It proved to be a mission impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Bonetto, a senior at Occidental College was part of a 22-player delegation 
representing the United States in last month's Third Stanley Cayasso Memorial 
Cup baseball tournament. And the U. S. team's Central American policy proved to 
be about as successful as the CIA's, as it lost four of its five games -- 
beating only Mexico in 10 innings -- to finish fifth in a six-team field. The 
Cuban national team downed Nicaragua to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We played really poorly the whole tournament," Bonetto said. "We didn't get 
much pitching, and when we did get some pitching, we couldn't score any runs." 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to saddle Bonetto with much of the blame as his participation 
was limited to two pinch-running assignments and a two-inning stint at second 
base. After an All-American season at Occidental, in which he batted a 
conference-leading .434, being forced to watch from the bench could have been 
tough for Bonetto to take. 
</P>
<P>
But the political science major said he came to Nicaragua more to observe 
culture than to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can apply what I learned in class," Bonetto said. "There were only 
about two people I talked to who didn't like the government. Everyone seemed to 
like the Sandinistas. The people are really politically aware about everything 
that is going on in their system. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really astute." 
</P>
<P>
The baseball tournament, which also drew teams from Panama and Colombia, was 
timed to coincide with celebrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the 
Sandinista-led insurrection that overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. And like a 
number of other events that took place during the two weeks of festivities, 
attendance at the tournament fell far short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that this tournament was going to be the biggest deal in Nicaragua," 
Bonetto said. "There were obviously some die-hards who were keeping up with 
everything, but I was surprised that the crowds were not that big." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the sparse attendance may have been the price of tickets. Box 
seats for the games in Managua went for 25,000 cordobas, with bleacher seats 
about a third that price. And while the box-seat price comes to about a dollar 
in U. S. currency, it's the equivalent of a day's wages for a middle-class 
Nicaraguan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bonetto was impressed with the sophistication of the fans -- many who 
cheered the U. S. team. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguans cheer big plays, but they want to see big swings and great 
plays and guys throwing hard," Bonetto said. "I think the fans were more 
interested in a good game more than anything else. They left halfway through 
some games if the games weren't any good." 
</P>
<P>
While the Cuban and Nicaraguan teams were national all-star squads, the U. S. 
was represented by the San Bernardino Indians, a free-lance member of the 
National Baseball Congress. And although the roster included a couple of 
players with minor-league experience, the majority of the players were from 
college and junior college programs. Bonetto says the team's youth and 
inability to adjust to unfamiliar surroundings contributed to its poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball players are used to routine. We're used to getting up at a certain 
hour and practicing or whatever," Bonetto said. "But when we first arrived in 
Managua, we didn't know what time our games would be, we didn't have any kind 
of a practice schedule. . . . We were living hour to hour." 
</P>
<P>
And moving from hotel to hotel. The team spent time in three hotels in less 
than 12 days in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys didn't like it at all," Bonetto said. "They were used to 
having what we consider everyday things. Like good water, decent food. But it's 
really a poor country. Most of the guys felt they couldn't perform at their 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"The tournament was not very well-run at all. It didn't seem to be put together 
very well from the start." 
</P>
<P>
That uncertainly took its toll on more than just the players. Andrew Lieberman, 
the executive director of Baseball Diplomacy, Inc., the U. S. delegation's 
sponsor, spent several days in a Mexico City hospital suffering from 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bonetto, the trip provided mostly fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were just really nice and they really went out of their way for 
you," he said. "They were very careful to make the distinction between the 
American people and the government. They would say something like, 'Although 
our governments disagree, we still like American people and American things. 
That was very, very nice. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to go to the medal round and win a medal. I would have 
liked to team to play better. But I wasn't disappointed at all."

HARBOR VIEW ADOLESCENT CENTER TO HOLD DEDICATION CEREMONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dedication ceremonies for the Harbor View Adolescent Center will be held 2 p.m. 
Friday and will include a tour of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The facility will be operated by Regency Health Services under contract with 
the county. The center will offer a 20-bed facility with skilled nursing staff, 
a 30-bed community-care facility and an on-site school funded by the Long Beach 
Unified School District, Supervisor Deane Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual combination of services will enable adolescents to be treated in a 
single setting without disruption. Court-ward youths ages 12 to 17 will receive 
specialized psychiatric treatment. Often these youngsters have been physically, 
sexually or emotionally abused by one or both parents, or their parents may be 
ill, dead, incarcerated or have been placed in a state hospital themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The new center began three years ago when the Board of Supervisors allocated $5 
million for a center that could serve severely emotionally disturbed youths as 
a means of improving their care and to lessen safety concerns at the 
overcrowded MacLaren Children's Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor View Adolescent Center is at 490 W. 14th St., Long Beach. Ginger 
Sumner is the center's administrator and Peter Zucker is the clinical director.

VIOLENCE, VANDALISM OVER PAST 2 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
SKINHEADS LINKED TO 10 INCIDENTS IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skinheads have been linked to at least 10 incidents of violence or vandalism 
over the last two years in Ventura County, during which time they have 
recruited school-age members with white-supremacist literature, county law 
enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing pattern," said Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury. "We're seeing recruitment activities in high schools, and also 
acquisition of deadlier weaponry. They're throughout the county." 
</P>
<P>
The beating of a teen-age girl with a baseball bat, two stabbings, a 
firebombing and a cross-burning were cited by police, residents and a Jewish 
watchdog organization as examples of violence committed by members of Ventura 
County skinhead gangs since early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
John R. Hatcher, head of Ventura County's NAACP, also has cited a series of 
racially motivated incidents and threatened last week to request a federal 
investigation in the wake of an Aug. 14 break-in at the home of a black 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The incident left the teacher's Simi Valley house in shambles and defaced by 
racial epithets. Drawers and cabinets were overturned, dishes and appliances 
shattered; clothes, toys and other personal belongings were in piles throughout 
the house. Brown paint had been poured into a clothes dryer and piano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graffiti on Walls 
</P>
<P>
A racial epithet was carved into the dining-room table, and graffiti was 
spray-painted onto interior walls, including swastikas and the word skinheads, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction at the teacher's house was the second apparent hate crime in 
Simi Valley in three months. 
</P>
<P>
On May 29, swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans were spray-painted on the back 
wall of Temple Ner Tamid on Appleton Road, but police have not linked the 
incident to skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Sgt. Kenneth Tacke said that although the vandalized residence and 
synagogue are in central Simi Valley, they are not in the same neighborhood and 
have no apparent connection. Officials of the synagogue declined to discuss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Another synagogue -- Temple Beth Torah -- was vandalized in Ventura last summer 
and fall by skinhead gang members, one of whom was convicted of felony burglary 
and vandalism and sentenced to six months in the county's juvenile detention 
facility, Colston Youth Center. A second suspect, comatose because of a car 
accident, has been unable to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Edward Kiner, of the synagogue, said that in the break-ins windows were 
smashed, anti-Semitic graffiti was spray-painted on walls, and a classroom was 
riddled with air-gun pellets. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were able to tie one of the incidents to two skinheads through 
fingerprints on rocks hurled through a window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Brought 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County authorities say they have leveled charges against several 
skinhead gang members -- known for their shaved heads, military-style dress and 
neo-Nazi beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Vernon Fields, 18, of Ojai is scheduled to appear in Ventura County 
Municipal Court today for a preliminary hearing on charges of attempting to 
bring a stolen .357-caliber magnum revolver into a courtroom July 26 while 
under the influence of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Don Coleman said that when police searched Fields' home, 
they found racist literature and cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of skinhead gangs have been convicted of a near-fatal stabbing, a 
beating with a rock and the vandalism of a synagogue over the last year in 
Ventura. An unsolved cross-burning in that city, which occurred in early 1988, 
is believed linked to skinheads, said Ventura Police Detective Jeffrey Killion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leader Imprisoned 
</P>
<P>
Killion said skinhead activity in Ventura has diminished since a local leader, 
19-year-old Scott Keith Porcho, was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon 
and sentenced in March to three years in state prison. Porcho's victim, who was 
white, was attacked on a Ventura beach with a rock. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Killion and other experts in hate crimes agree that skinheads should be 
taken seriously because they are believed to have ties to White Aryan 
Resistance, the white-supremacist group based in Fallbrook, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Recruitment literature distributed by skinheads in Ventura County schools and 
elsewhere in Southern California has been traced to that group, as well to the 
Pacific Palisades-based National Socialist White American Party, Killion said. 
The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in Los Angeles concurred. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Rosenthal, an ADL attorney, said organizations such as White Aryan 
Resistance exploit youths who often join skinhead gangs in search of a sense of 
belonging. 
</P>
<P>
Skinheads handed out literature and attempted to recruit members outside 
Camarillo schools last academic year, said Camarillo neighborhood activist 
Jessie Roybal, who is executive director of the Candaleria American Indian 
Council in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House Firebombed 
</P>
<P>
Roybal led residents of Camarillo's Calle Sirculo neighborhood in March in 
complaining to city officials and police about intimidation and the firebombing 
of a home, which she contended were carried out by skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
She said her family has been the object of harassment by skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
"Beer bottles are thrown at our house, obscenities are yelled at us; they've 
followed my daughter from the house to work. We've been called every name in 
the book," said Roybal, who is of American Indian ancestry and whose husband is 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
She blamed skinheads for two beatings last year -- including one in which a 
skinhead gang member beat a teen-age girl with a baseball bat for quitting the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wetzel, the girl's stepfather, said the family did not press charges 
because of fear of retaliation.

15 VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II GET POW MEDALS 
</P>

Fifteen World War II veterans from Ventura County received a newly created 
prisoner-of-war medal Wednesday in a ceremony attended by U.S. Secretary for 
Veteran Affairs Edward J. Derwinski. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai), members of several veterans' 
organizations, military officers and county officials were present at the POW 
Medal ceremony held on a lawn at the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency over the years to forget the sacrifice that was made by men 
and women during the times peace has been threatened," said Derwinski, who was 
appointed to the new Cabinet-level post in March. 
</P>
<P>
His department is charged with providing health care, disability payments, 
pensions, burial sites and other services for the nation's veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Medal recipient Carl Rohlfing, who spent 3 1/2 years as a prisoner of the 
Japanese in the Philippines, said, "It's kind of nice to receive a little 
recognition, even though it wasn't really necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Rohlfing, who estimates that he weighed about 90 pounds at the end of his 
internment, said he survived the sparse rice rations, forced labor and daily 
fear of execution by concentrating on getting back to the United States alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept remembering America and looking forward to getting home. It could 
be real hard, though, when you didn't know from day to day what your life was 
worth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of her husband, Edward, who died in 1984, Salina Coyle accepted the 
POW Medal with tears in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony she said, "I just wish so much that he could have been here 
because he would have been so proud." 
</P>
<P>
Receiving the POW Medal were Rohlfing, Ray Church, Richard Davis, Robert 
Dundas, Wayne Evans, Delmar Kaech, Lawrence Moraga, Nicasio Quilentang, LeRoy 
Rusch, Arthur Santoyo, Frank Tomlinson, Joseph Felix and Pedro Domingues. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting posthumous POW Medals on behalf of their husbands were Coyle and 
Maxine Miller, widow of Duane Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County resident Lloyd Hill also received a Purple Heart for wounds 
received during a bombing on the Philippine island of Mindanao in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans from all wars are eligible for the medal, but apparently no Vietnam 
veterans from Ventura County applied for it. "Mainly, we don't have many POWs 
from Vietnam yet in Ventura County," said Nancy Brodine, chairman of the 
POW/MIA committee in the Ventura County chapter of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars.

JUNIOR OLYMPIAN; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL, 10, HAS INCREDIBLE SPEED AND POTENTIAL TO RUN IN OLYMPICS IF SHE 
CONTINUES TO IMPROVE WITH AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A pink clip in her hair, Aminah Haddad pounded down the dirt running track at 
Bell High School one recent afternoon at a speed astonishing for her age. She 
left no one in the dust only because she was practicing by herself. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who will not be 11 until next month, believes, as do her coaches, that 
she may be running toward a great future; the Olympics already are on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Her best times -- 12.5 seconds in the 100 meters and 26.3 in the 200 -- indeed 
qualify her as a child phenomenon. Many high school athletes can't sprint that 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
"She has incredible natural speed," said Roger Lipkis, coach of the West Valley 
Eagles, a 250-member youth track club in the San Fernando Valley for which 
Aminah runs. 
</P>
<P>
But it may be too soon to predict that some day she will dominate her sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's hard to tell when they are 10 or 11 what their future is," 
Lipkis said. "But at this point (Aminah) is significantly better than most 
10-year-olds. On a local level, in the San Fernando Valley, she is far and away 
the best. On a national level there are kids who can beat her, but most of them 
are 11 years old. I've seen kids who are incredible at 8, 9 and 10 who never 
get any better. When they're 13 you start to see the long-term potential." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Is a Former Runner 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, whose father is an ex-runner and whose mother used to teach physical 
education, started competing at 7. In three years she was undefeated against 
girls her age in more than 100 meets. It was not until this summer, during top 
national competition, that, to her surprise, she did not always cross the 
finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who, because she is deaf in one ear, must pay closer attention to the 
starter than her competitors, is also coached by her father. With stopwatch in 
hand, he watched her practice last week on the Bell field near their home. 
</P>
<P>
"She is getting stronger and bigger, and has the intensity and desire," said 
Gerald Haddad, 44, who like his wife, Chestine, is a native Philadelphian. He 
sometimes runs alongside his 4-foot-10, 87-pound daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't beat him," Aminah said. 
</P>
<P>
Haddad said Aminah never tires of practicing and that at this time of the year, 
with the long, arduous track season behind her, she keeps asking him, "Dad, 
when do we start cross-country?" 
</P>
<P>
Shy around adults, Aminah does not offer long discourses on why she runs. She 
just says, "Because it's fun, and I like the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from an obsession with track, Aminah is a typical smiling 10-year-old. 
She enjoys playing with her girlfriend, Arlene Ramos, and is still attached to 
her dolls. Fastidious about her appearance, she changes her outfits and hair 
style several times a day. "She likes to be little Miss Perfect," her father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 Olympics, Aminah sat before her TV and wrote down the marks of 
all the runners. She records her own meet performances on notebook paper 
adorned with hand-drawn hearts. She does aerobics to a Bruce Jenner tape. Carl 
Lewis and Florence Griffith-Joyner are her heroes, although she thinks that 
when she gets older she will do without the kind of flamboyant outfits 
Griffith-Joyner wears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Is This So Easy?' 
</P>
<P>
After winning the 100 meters in the Midget Division (ages 9 and 10) of the 
Hershey National Track Championship at Hershey, Pa., last year, Aminah asked 
her father, "Why is this so easy?" 
</P>
<P>
Haddad told her, "Because you practice all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But it was also last summer, at a meet at Bell High, when Aminah lost to a 
12-year-old girl. "We put her in with older runners to give her a perspective 
on the competition," Haddad said. "She cried. She just couldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel too good," Aminah said last week, remembering that moment. 
</P>
<P>
But it prepared her for the reality of tougher national competition. Early in 
July she finished third in her age division in the 200 meters at the Track 
Athletic Congress National Youth Athletics Championship at the University of 
Texas-Arlington. That remains her biggest thrill . . . "because I had a lot of 
fun there." 
</P>
<P>
In late July, she finished fourth in the 200 and eighth in the 400 at the Track 
City Classic in Eugene, Ore. During that meet she ran 26.3 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
(Her 12.5 in the 100 was run in June at a Junior Olympics qualifying meet at UC 
Irvine.) 
</P>
<P>
After the Oregon meet, Aminah finished fourth out of more than 5,000 finalists 
in the 200 meters at the Junior Olympics in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
And early this month at the California State Games at Point Loma Nazarene 
College in San Diego, she finished third in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
"This season was a tremendous experience for her because she had never seen 
competition like that," her father said. "She used to think she could give kids 
a head start and still win." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her speed, Aminah has yet to acquire the proper running form. "Her 
technique is not good," Lipkis said, and her father added: "We are constantly 
working on her mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't swing my arms high enough," Aminah said. 
</P>
<P>
During the track season, from January to August, Aminah trains with the West 
Valley Eagles twice a week at UCLA, where she has been instructed by former USC 
sprint star Henry Hines, and at Canoga Park High School. She competed in a meet 
every Saturday and often on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"We drive 40 miles to practice and on the other days she says, 'Dad, let's go 
running,' " said Haddad, principal at the private Town and Country Elementary 
School in South Gate. "She's a competitive young lady." 
</P>
<P>
But trophies do not mean a lot to Aminah, according to her mother. "She's more 
into being part of a team," Chestine said. "When she wins, it's great for the 
moment, then she's back playing. She befriends her competitors, and they comb 
each other's hair." 
</P>
<P>
Chestine Haddad said her daughter lives up to her Muslim name of 
Aminah-Takreem-Kibibi Haddad, which means reliable trustworthy little lady. "At 
school she completes her assignments and has things in on time . . . she's very 
dependable," said the former teacher at Lynwood High School. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, under a Los Angeles school busing program, Aminah will attend 
Oliver W. Holmes Junior High School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
And she will continue to dream about winning the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"She insists she's running in Barcelona," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll be too young," maintains Aminah, who will be 13 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A more reasonable goal would be the 1996 Games. "If she continues to run well, 
she might have a shot then," Lipkis said. 
</P>
<P>
Aminah, who said she will not be too disappointed if she has to wait until '96, 
has another goal: To run the 100 in 10.1. The women's record is 10.49. 
</P>
<P>
Although the words she spoke at the Bell High field that afternoon were few, 
they left no doubt that this is a confident little girl who knows what she 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
And so she fixed her hair and took off down the track. 
</P>

PANEL PUTS CAP ON COST OVERRUNS FOR METRO RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to ease the Los Angeles City Council's concerns about escalating 
Metro Rail construction costs, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
on Wednesday voted to impose a 10% cap on future cost overruns in the 
$3.7-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which is paying for about 6% of the cost to build the 
17.3-mile subway from downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley, had 
previously balked when the commission asked it to assume up to 10% of the cost 
overruns for the second phase of the project. City officials said they would 
accept liability for no more than 5% or $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scaling Back 
</P>
<P>
In the compromise agreement approved Wednesday, the commission proposed that it 
split any cost overruns equally with the city, each assuming liability for up 
to 5% of any costs that went over budget on Phase 2. If escalating costs pushed 
the contracts over that limit, money would be saved by scaling back 
expenditures, eliminating features or postponing construction of stations, 
commission officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to approve the agreement, and that would clear the way 
for the commission to apply for federal funds to finance this next 6.8-mile 
phase of the project, which will punch the twin subway tunnels from McArthur 
Park out to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Led the Fight 
</P>
<P>
"This satisfies the concerns of the City Council," said Councilman Michael Woo, 
who sits on the commission. He said Councilman Nate Holden, who led the fight 
to limit the city's obligation for cost overruns, has said he will support the 
commission's compromise agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The city had previously agreed to fund its $96-million share of the second 
phase and, with the limits put on by the compromise, is expected to sign the 
funding agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Rail financing is complex. Half of the funds come from the federal 
government, with the state and local governments paying the remaining costs. 
The commission is the designated funding authority. All cost overruns must be 
paid by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of cost overruns has become a primary concern since a commission 
audit released earlier this month revealed that the first 4.4-mile phase of the 
project that is being built by the Southern California Rapid Transit District 
is two years behind schedule and $135 million over its budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turn It Over 
</P>
<P>
The commission audit, done by an outside consultant, reported that costs had 
gone up in large part because of transit district red tape and poor project 
management. The commission wants to take project management away from the RTD 
and turn it over to a new agency that would be set up just to build rail 
transit in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Until the commission audit was released, transit district authorities had 
maintained that the project was on time and within budget. The district's own 
audit, released the same day as the commission's audit, reported the overruns 
were no more than 8%, or $102 million. 
</P>
<P>
District officials angrily charged that the commission was exaggerating the 
problem in an effort to push the district aside and take over building of the 
subway.

Hundreds of people evacuated near a derailed train were allowed to return home 
Wednesday after explosive naphtha solvent was unloaded from an overturned 
leaking tank car, authorities said. Nine cars of a 99-car Southern Pacific 
freight train jumped the tracks in the railroad yards on the southeastern edge 
of the city Tuesday.

CHURCH LEADERS ASK MORE PASTORS TO HOUSE ILLEGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The leaders of two Los Angeles churches that offer sanctuary and refuge to 
about 300 illegal aliens appealed to fellow clergymen of all faiths Wednesday 
to open their doors to homeless aliens who are turned away each night. 
</P>
<P>
Priests at the two parishes -- La Placita Church just north of the Los Angeles 
Civic Center and the Dolores Mission Church in Boyle Heights -- said at a press 
conference that they are no longer able to offer shelter and services to 
several thousand Mexicans and Central Americans who come there each day for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (churches) may think it's more problems than blessings but we have 
desperate people here," said Father Gregory Boyle, pastor of the Dolores 
Mission church. "We would like other churches to help us." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle and other church officials said a letter was sent last week to 144 
churches and temples. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the poorest of the poor (churches) and yet we still do what we can," 
one priest said. 
</P>
<P>
Several pastors contacted by the two churches said late Wednesday that they 
would have to consult with parish governing bodies or superiors before deciding 
whether to accept homeless aliens. 
</P>
<P>
But more typical was the reaction of church officials who said that their 
congregations did not have the funds or facilities to house people overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate what Father Boyle and Father (Luis) Olivares (pastor of the La 
Placita church) are doing, but we just can't afford to accept people," said 
Father Valentin Ramon, pastor of Our Lady of Solitude Church in East Los 
Angeles. "We don't have the toilets or other things that are needed." 
</P>
<P>
With the outbreak of war in Central America, as many as 500,000 Salvadorans and 
Nicaraguans have resettled in the greater Los Angeles area. In response to the 
reported activities of death squads in El Salvador, La Placita and Dolores 
Mission churches declared themselves as a sanctuary for aliens in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the homeless men at La Placita have been blamed for a 
growing crime problem. The situation has forced the merchants at Olvera Street, 
located across Main Street from the church, to meet with Olivares to find a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Boyle acknowledged the problem, but said that a 
majority of the men staying at the two churches were law-abiding. "Only a few 
of them create problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs that read, "Before we are Latinos, we are human. Help us," 
several homeless men who appeared at the news conference said that they 
supported the priests' plea for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here only to escape the death squads in my native El Salvador," said 
Rene, who asked that his last name not be used. "Here, people not only 
discriminate against me because of my skin. They also discriminate because of 
my language."

12-YEAR-OLD SAN PEDRO GIRL IN LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
VICTORIA STEPS TO PLATE, AND INTO RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.

<TEXT>
<P>
The score was 1 to 0, with the team from San Pedro ahead. Twelve-year-old 
Victoria Brucker stretched over her bat, and then pulled her long dark hair 
away from her neck, where it was sticking in the muggy Pennsylvania heat. She 
picked at the shirt of her uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she stepped up to the plate, and in doing so on Wednesday became the 
first girl to play on an American team in this youngest version of the national 
pastime -- the Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
With a nonchalance befitting a big league player, which in fact Victoria hopes 
someday to be, the Eastview Little League clean-up hitter took one, two, three 
casual warm-up swings, while the pitcher from the Tampa sized her up and 
prepared to throw. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 10,000 roared from the stands of Lamade Stadium and from the 
grassy hill beyond center field, where people had gathered on blankets and lawn 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria -- who only allows her teammates to call her Vicky -- let the first 
pitch go by. 
</P>
<P>
"Strike one!" came the umpire's call. 
</P>
<P>
Her stepfather, 38-year-old Rick Roderick, the first person who ever threw a 
ball to her, said he could tell from the stands that Victoria was not herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She's nervous," he said to Victoria's mother, Elizabeth. They had driven 2,700 
miles from San Pedro to be here. 
</P>
<P>
In three more pitches, Victoria struck out. 
</P>
<P>
But, as they say in baseball, it ain't over 'til it's over, and Victoria -- the 
team's leading home-run hitter -- would find redemption in her next three at 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
She walked twice and, in her last at bat, knocked a single through the infield. 
She scored every time she reached base, and the San Pedro team, which won the 
Western Regional championship last weekend and was playing in a World Series 
for the first time, went on to rout the Southern champs from Tampa, 12 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
In all, San Pedro pounded out 14 hits, with three home runs. Tim Harper, who 
pitched all six innings, got two hits, as did Gary Sloan and Steve Williams, 
both pitchers, and left fielder Joe Sulentor. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro now advances to the semifinals, playing a team from Trumbull, Conn., 
today for the U.S. championship. If the team is victorious in this game, it 
will play for the world title Saturday on network television. In the last five 
years, Asian teams have won the Little League title, and this year, the Chinese 
team from Taipei, winners the last two years, is touted as the team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the fans here are pulling for San Pedro -- and Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 15 years since girls started to participate in organized Little 
League, at first playing in a softball division and later creeping onto the 
rosters of regular hardball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Although Victoria was not the first female athlete to play in a Little League 
World Series (Victoria Roche of Brussels, Belgium, earned that distinction in 
1984), she was the first girl on a U.S. team to take part, and the first from 
anywhere to get a hit and score a run. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the girl is gonna get them," Kathy Gilbert, a Little League 
staffer, said with a laugh as she distributed press credentials in league 
headquarters near the stadium. The cheers for Victoria from the crowd, here to 
observe the 50th anniversary of Little League, indicated by their volume that 
Gilbert was not alone in the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, a 5-foot, 3-inch, 137-pound first baseman, made several good 
defensive plays, twice making good pegs to finish off double plays. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, as all Little Leaguers seem to divine, is also a matter of style, and 
Victoria had all the proper moves down pat. She would stand casually between 
plays, weight on one leg, one hand on a hip. She would walk off base a few 
feet, and smooth the red dirt with her cleats. Then she would return to the 
base, and kick it. And adjust her cap. And lean over, hands and mitt on knees, 
ready for play. 
</P>
<P>
"Victoria eats, lives and breathes baseball," said her mother, Elizabeth 
Roderick. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how little girls love to get together and play with each other? Not 
Victoria. What does she do? If she's home she puts on her mitt and drags her 
brother, Adam, (age 8) outside." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria handles questions about herself with aplomb, looking half shy and a 
little bored. Before the game, reporters constantly asked her if she felt 
special, and she always shrugged and said, "No. I'm just one of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
Then she'd laugh and shrug like a girl who is not yet sure of herself. But she 
is sure about one thing: baseball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hungered for Hardball 
</P>
<P>
From the time she first played T-ball, a modified version of baseball played by 
the youngest players, Victoria hungered to play hardball. She refused to follow 
the suggestions of many coaches and switch to softball, like many other girls 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria says she does not know why that happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really remember," she said during the warm-up, "because I was 9 then. 
My mom probably told me to do what you want to do and I wanted to play 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's bedroom at home, Roderick said, is "wall to wall" trophies from her 
swimming days, which she did before age 9, and baseballs retrieved from home 
runs she has hit. The only concession to girlish fancy is a pink wristband. But 
the wristband stayed home this week. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, she enters the eighth grade at Dodson Junior High School in San 
Pedro, although her teammates, who also are 12, will be entering seventh grade. 
Victoria has skipped a grade, and says she earns A's and B's in her studies. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to choose a career path, of course, but Victoria does have an 
early preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play baseball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, by her presence, attracted unusual press attention. From the moment 
she stepped out for warm-ups, she was surrounded by camera crews and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Her teammates have accepted the fact that Victoria gets much of the ink, said 
team manager Joe Dileva, an insurance agent who has volunteered with the league 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just another player to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The team is comprised of 14 all-stars from the Eastview Little League in San 
Pedro. It earned a trip to the World Series with 17 victories in preliminary 
play. 
</P>
<P>
And Victoria carried her load, hitting nine home runs in the early games and 
sometimes pitching as well. In one regional game, her stepfather recalled, 
opposing players laughed at her. Then she hit a home run. The next time, they 
walked her intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she thought she played in the Wednesday game, Victoria was modest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her face revealed a more vivid account, however, after her base hit. It was 
fairly aglow as she rounded first base, and took a few taunting steps toward 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Added her manager: "She was trying to put the ball out in the first. After 
that, she calmed down. They didn't give her nothing to hit. They didn't want to 
give up a long ball to a girl, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Victoria was escorted by a coach to a television interview. 
Several times along the way, she had to stop to sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"She handles it really well," her mother said, adding in a lower voice, "I hope 
that continues." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, meanwhile, trudged along next to the coach, Nick Lusic. Even though 
they won, he was saying, the team didn't play well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad game, really," he said, ticking off mistakes players had made. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria looked up at the sky, where a drizzling rain had started to fall. For 
once, it seemed, she'd had her fill of baseball and, more to the point, her 
moment in its spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I want," she said, "to go to the pool."

MET SEEKING ARTFUL WAY OUT OF PINCH

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To its many admirers it is America's foremost art museum, a cultural colossus 
in the gilded heart of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Its vast collections are the envy of other institutions. Its expertise and 
influence in the world of art are enormous. Its trustees' decisions are 
emulated by other museums at home and abroad. In the world of diplomacy, it 
routinely plays host to heads of state and negotiates exchanges with other 
great international museums. In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a 
social pinnacle, pacesetter and a potent political force. 
</P>
<P>
Its gray beaux-arts buildings take up four of the very best blocks of 5th 
Avenue and its Medieval annex, the Cloisters, overlooks scenic vistas of the 
Hudson River. With well over 2 million treasures from 5 millenniums in some 400 
galleries, 500 guards, more than 100,000 members and a yearly budget of over 
$135 million, the Metropolitan is the largest art museum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director's Pride 
</P>
<P>
"The holdings of the Metropolitan Museum are among the richest in the world," 
preens Guy-Philippe Lannes de Montebello, the museum's director, who traces his 
lineage to both the Marquis de Sade and Marshal Lannes, one of Napoleon's top 
officers. "In its encyclopedic scope, this museum covers the history of world 
culture. In that, it is unique." 
</P>
<P>
But for all its grandeur, some of the Metropolitan's strongest supporters say 
it is facing major financial and operational challenges, difficulties in part 
common to other museums. Officials at the Met project a $4.1-million deficit 
this fiscal year, and other deficits in the $3-million-to-$4-million range 
could occur in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
How the Metropolitan responds will be watched closely by other American 
museums, which over the years have looked to the Met for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A program of serious cost cutting, coupled with major new fund raising 
initiatives, is under way at the Metropolitan. The task is complicated because 
no huge ticketed visiting "blockbuster" exhibitions -- which can significantly 
raise revenues -- are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Debt 
</P>
<P>
"$4 million of deficits is obviously unacceptable in the long run," said Arthur 
Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, who is chairman of the 
museum's trustees. "You could cope with those kinds of numbers for a short 
period of time. You can't cope with them over a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I am an optimist. I think we are going to be able to close (the gap), 
but I think we are going to have a difficult time this year, because New York 
City has got itself some difficult problems, and we're going to have to ride it 
through." 
</P>
<P>
The Met's trustees and officers see opportunities amid the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There are serious underlying challenges, no question, vulnerabilities we are 
going to have to address," said Diana T. Murray, the Metropolitan's vice 
president for finance and treasurer. "But there are huge up sides, untapped 
potential. Quality begets quality, it really does. We've got an eminently 
salable product." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan's potential and problems, and a recently stepped-up thrust 
toward marketing, come as it and other American museums are struggling to cope 
with a troublesome climate in art management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Works Donated 
</P>
<P>
Because of changes in the federal tax laws in 1986, contributions of art to 
museums have plummeted. Astronomical auction prices make it impossible for most 
institutions to purchase major paintings. A congressional committee is 
considering whether to recommend taxing the income of museum shops and other 
business activities. 
</P>
<P>
Many corporations have cut their donations in favor of other, more visible 
causes. While museum attendance has continued to rise, directors view an 
increasingly broad canvas of leisure time competition. 
</P>
<P>
"All museums are running very hard to stay in place," said Edward H. Able Jr., 
director of the American Assn. of Museums. " . . . We have not in this country 
properly funded our museums to maintain the level of collections care, 
management and conservation that is required." 
</P>
<P>
"There is terrific intensity of competition for the philanthropic dollar 
because of AIDS, homelessness, educational and medical problems," said Michael 
S. Churchman, director of development at the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in 
Kansas City, Mo. "The government as a source of funds is declining, but the 
expectations of the public are greater in terms of educational priorities, 
exhibitions and programs." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many of the great patrons of years past are disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"What's been lost is a very powerful American tradition, which is the patient, 
loving collecting of things over many years by people who built a life around 
the activity and who built a life around devotion to a museum," said John 
Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum, who worked as a senior curator of 
European paintings at the Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
"The collectors have a far shorter attention span. The pace is quicker and 
(collectors) cash in their chips and move on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan's problems are mitigated, to a degree, by a $430-million 
endowment -- built in part through years of tapping some of the wealthiest art 
patrons in the world -- and help from the city of New York, which pays 21% of 
its operating expenses, including the heat and lighting bills. 
</P>
<P>
But New York City's budget is badly strained by its continuing struggle with 
crime, drugs and AIDS -- and the city's contributions to the Met have declined 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ambitious construction program, fed by a desire to remain at the 
top, has considerably complicated the museum's finances. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan is paying principal and interest of more than $4 million a 
year, through 2015, on more than $48 million in bonds that the New York State 
Dormitory Authority issued on its behalf to pay for the expansion. Since 1970, 
the Met has added six wings and increased its space by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Timely Contribution 
</P>
<P>
During the Metropolitan's early years, when it faced a winter heating crisis 
because of money problems, financier J. P. Morgan simply sent it a railroad car 
of coal. Nowadays, gifts of money are announced with great fanfare but often 
arrive in installments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some donations for interior portions of the museum's 
140,000-square-foot Henry R. Kravis Wing have been stretched over a period of 
years. The city's bureaucratic machinery has been very slow in releasing its 
$5-million share of the project for this year, forcing the Met to use its own 
badly needed funds to pay contractors and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Met also faces the increasing cost of competing with universities and other 
museums for some of its most famous curators. At the lower end of the ladder, 
many promising junior art scholars find it extremely difficult to live in New 
York on current salaries. With 2,200 employees, the Met is a labor-intensive 
institution, and the costs of some benefits have soared. 
</P>
<P>
The museum collects only voluntary donations (suggested gift: $5) at the door, 
and does not charge an admission fee except for "blockbuster" exhibits. Museum 
officials expect a 24% decline in admissions revenue this year because no 
blockbuster is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Because of all these factors, top management at the Met has begun crafting a 
strategy for mitigating deficits in the short term, and for capturing new 
streams of revenue that can sustain the museum in the decades ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"This deficit is large, but the budget that has been prepared (for this fiscal 
year) is an honest and open one," said William H. Luers, 60, a former 
ambassador to Czechoslovakia who left a long State Department career to become 
the Metropolitan's president in 1986. "We have to reduce that (deficit) to 
zero, which will happen over the next several years." 
</P>
<P>
"I think museums today are very much where universities were 10 years ago," 
added Murray, the treasurer. "They are just beginning to realize they are big 
business, and the size and complexity requires a different style of 
management." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan's strategy combines austerity inside the museum with a 
controversial move toward marketing. Some elements of the plan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extending weekend hours to increase admissions and raise revenues at the 
book store, restaurant and parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increasing the suggested admission donation to $6 (the average contribution 
is $3.20), in steps over a number of years, is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Making a variety of budget cuts, from tightening guidelines for travel 
expenses to using maintenance and security staff more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soliciting more national associates (patrons who live at least 150 miles 
from the museum). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sending Sulzberger and Luers to Japan, and perhaps also to Europe, to raise 
money. Both men lobby city and state officials on issues important to the 
museum, such as getting the city to make quicker payment of its share of the 
Kravis wing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Imitating university fund-raising techniques, including deferred-giving 
programs (in which donors give over time to maximize tax benefits), annual 
giving (yearly pledges not destined for the endowment that can be fully spent), 
and seeking endowment of its 19 curatorial departments (just as universities 
seek to endow distinguished professorships). So far, eight of these endowments 
have been funded. 
</P>
<P>
In its marketing thrust, the Met courts the most contention. 
</P>
<P>
Some curators at the Metropolitan and other institutions say angrily that 
marketing means that art is being hyped and treated as a commodity. (Marketing 
is a term so emotionally charged that it isn't even used at the museum.) 
</P>
<P>
But, in his office at the New York Times, Sulzberger is not hesitant. "I don't 
think there is anything wrong with marketing," he said. "I think you should 
market. . . . I think we're all nuts if we don't. I think it is good for all 
our institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Some marketing efforts have met little resistance. For example, passengers 
aboard some Pan Am flights last month began hearing the distinctive, 
mellifluous voice of De Montebello announcing the fall exhibitions at the Met 
and narrating a 30-minute audio "tour" of 16 treasures, including the Rembrandt 
self portrait, which De Montebello said once held him spellbound for 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been literally forced into submission by this very intelligent, slightly 
ironic man who peers at us so resolutely from 300 years ago out of this crusty 
canvas. I hope you will go to the Met and try to experience it on your own," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other efforts -- including using the Met's galleries for parties -- have proved 
to be controversial. Earlier this year, New York magazine accused the museum of 
"allowing the nouveau riche to run amok in its halls. . . . Some people are 
beginning to question whether all of this chewing and swilling and posturing is 
proper in such a proud temple of art. Is it not, they wonder, something of a 
desecration?" 
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that for a $30,000 donation, most anyone could party at 
the Met. It cited examples such as the lavish affair that multimillionaire Sid 
Bass gave for his bride-to-be, Mercedes Kellogg, another that launched a 
perfume named for actress Catherine Deneuve, and the $3-million wedding 
reception given there for Laura Steinberg and Jonathan Tisch, whose parents 
have been generous patrons of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Since the magazine article, the Metropolitan has tightened its rules for 
parties. A gala now must be related to the opening of an exhibition or the 
installation of a gallery. But some of the Met's multimillion-dollar donors do 
enjoy partying, and for a corporation considering sponsoring an exhibition, a 
party at the museum can be an added inducement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure it is in our interests to stop all festivities here," said 
Luers. "The fact is, an awful lot of people enjoy looking at works of art at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gatherings have underscored the Metropolitan's position as one of 
New York's premier social institutions. New York magazine also noted that to be 
named in the museum's annual report as a fellow or a member of one of its 
visiting committees "is as important these days as a mention in the Social 
Register." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Museum was chartered by the state in 1870. It was opened at a 
time when money flowed freely, when newly wealthy merchant princes were eager 
for social acceptance in the Establishment -- a condition that still exists 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"To be taken into the Met means to be taken into the heart of all the right 
things about New York," said James P. Shenton, professor of history at Columbia 
University and a savvy observer of the New York scene. "You know there, 
civilization is alive and well. . . . You don't grovel to be taken into the 
Met, but you are grateful." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., have been 
the leaders in presenting and promoting blockbuster exhibitions, which can be 
highly profitable through admissions as well as in sales of related posters, 
calendars, books and other merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, some other museum directors, as well as some curators at 
the Met, have expressed fears that museums were being turned into places from 
which the public would expect a continuing parade of new things. 
</P>
<P>
The Met "is a great museum because of its collections, primarily because of its 
staff," Walsh, the Getty Museum director, said. "Both of these need to be 
treated as they deserve. That means the public ought to be encouraged, above 
all, to see the permanent collections as the main reason to come. It's 
practically impossible nowadays to stage a temporary exhibition with materials 
that are better than what the museum has already." 
</P>
<P>
"What the museum needs now is more creativity in using permanent collections 
for the public's benefit, not bigger and sexier traveling carnivals," Walsh 
added. "The Met has all it takes to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of other museums have found that blockbusters no longer offer a sure 
financial fix. The balance sheets for blockbusters are closely held at the Met, 
but at other museums, rising insurance and other costs associated with such 
shows have drained potential profits. In addition, many of the major artists 
already have been exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can count on blockbusters to pull our financial chestnuts out 
of the fire," Sulzberger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarly Exhibitions 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, De Montebello defends the scholarship involved in such 
exhibitions at the Met. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his office, the 53-year-old director rose from his seat 
and moved from bookcase to bookcase, plucking huge catalogues from the shelves 
and tossing them on a table. The 640-page book from the recent massive (392 
works) Degas retrospective landed loudly. 
</P>
<P>
The Degas "was one of the most intellectually rigorous exhibitions we have ever 
mounted. Should it be put in doubt because a lot of people came?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Still, De Montebello added: "I would rather be viewed as a stately pleasure 
dome than as a caravansary," (an Asian inn where caravans stopped for the 
night). "And I think 
</P>
<P>
there was a moment when we were flirting with being a caravansary. I do not 
think that is the case any more." 
</P>
<P>
De Montebello, director since 1978, is in charge of all curatorial activities, 
the conservation of the museum's collection and acquisitions, its library, 
concerts and lectures and public information as it relates to art. Luers, as 
president, supervises the finances, fund-raising, memberships, maintenance and 
operations, merchandising and the legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
Luers, who has assumed a much more public fund-raising role in New York than 
his predecessor, William B. Macomber, "knows the people," said Sulzberger. "He 
knows where the money is. He is completely open and ready to go and ask for it. 
. . . He is a good asker." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are fairly comfortable," Luers said of his relationship with De 
Montebello. "I really defer to him on aesthetic judgments. If I've got a 
comment, it is in private, to him. I would never make a statement in a staff 
meeting or in public disagreeing with him on aesthetic issues, and he defers to 
me on business questions and outreach and financial issues and the whole 
question of membership. It is a good relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"In the year-plus I have been chairman, I have not found myself in the role of 
a tie-breaker between those guys," Sulzberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Some other museums have tried the Met's structure of dual management and have 
abandoned it as an unnecessary division of authority. De Montebello says it 
works at the Metropolitan because the museum is so large. 
</P>
<P>
Wings of the Met are bigger than many other museums. The treasures range from 
the largest collection of Rembrandts in the United States to primitive shields 
from the Solomon Islands. To visit the museum on a weekend often is to 
experience cultural gridlock. The crowds streaming up its broad front steps can 
rival rush hour at a busy subway station. 
</P>
<P>
Sulzberger grew up across 5th Avenue from the Met and still lives just a few 
steps from the museum. Some Sundays after he returns from the country, he will 
wander through its galleries. Sometimes, he confesses, he has gotten lost. 
</P>
<P>
A major task, he and top officials agree, is to make the Met more user 
friendly, not only for its foreign visitors but for all New Yorkers. In a city 
where minorities make up more than half the population, the role of the museum 
is under review and strengthening its educational outreach is a priority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advantages of Size 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Met uses its size to great advantage by marshaling it 
expertise, its collections, its location, its role as a training ground for art 
scholars and its relations abroad to be an institution of enormous influence. 
</P>
<P>
It lobbies actively in New York and Washington. Once a year, the museum gives 
receptions to which the presidents of each of New York City's five boroughs may 
bring guests. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's art awards are presented at the Met and 
paintings on loan from the museum decorate the offices of key city and state 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But for all that, curators remain the heart of the museum, and the effort to 
endow its departments is a reaffirmation of that fact. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is we are there for (curators)," said Murray, the museum's treasurer. 
"We are secondary in the scheme." 
</P>
<P>
In an era when when soaring auction prices preclude most purchases, a curator's 
expertise and the ability to bargain discreetly are especially prized. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Raggio, chairman of the Metropolitan's Department of European Sculpture 
and Decorative Arts, recalled a time recently when a dealer showed her a "bad, 
miserable photograph" of an object that was in a bank vault in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"The day came (to see the object) . . . they pulled out this bust on the floor. 
It was not an ideal way of exhibiting, you know." 
</P>
<P>
The more Raggio looked, the more she was convinced. The bust was the earliest 
known portrait of the young Cosimo I de' Medici, the duke who lived from 1519 
to 1574. The rare work by Baccio Bandinelli -- the greatest Renaissance 
sculptor after Michelangelo in Florence -- now rests in the Metropolitan's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel you have wrenched from history a very crucial work. In a way, you 
almost have salvaged it," Raggio said, "brought it back and sort of gave it 
back to the world. That is what one does with great passion." 
</P>
<P>
And, in these days of pinched budgets, was there some bargaining over the 
price? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, of course," Raggio replied with a lilt in her voice and a small laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"One always does bargain -- yes -- a little bit -- yes, yes, yes!"

MAZOWIECKI TO GIVE 'OUR NEW PARTNERS' MORE CABINET SEATS

<P>
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is expected to be confirmed today as prime minister of 
Poland, said Wednesday that he intends to broaden the first Solidarity-led 
government by appointing more than two Communists to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our new partners must not feel like secondary partners," Mazowiecki told a 
meeting of Solidarity deputies in the National Assembly, acknowledging 
Communist demands for a larger role in his government. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear note of conciliation, Mazowiecki conceded that an angry Communist 
Party could sabotage Solidarity's reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be a Trap' 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party in total negation would be a trap for the country," he 
said. "No opposition in the world that . . . has the army and the security 
services . . . remains the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement arrived at by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and President 
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communists were guaranteed control of the two Cabinet 
ministries -- Defense and Interior -- that control the military and the police. 
There are about 20 major Cabinet posts to be filled. The Communists' 
parliamentary majority vanished last week when Walesa lured their former 
coalition partners, the United Peasants' and Democratic parties, into the 
Solidarity camp. Jaruzelski then gave the green light for the formation of a 
Solidarity government and the Communists, for the first time in 45 years, were 
forced to bargain with the opposition for a role in government. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, after elections in June, rejected Communist appeals to join a 
"grand coalition" headed by the Communists. On Wednesday, Mazowiecki spoke of 
the need for a "broad coalition." 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broad coalition 
having the support of all forces sitting in the Sejm (the lower house of 
Parliament)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki's gesture Wednesday followed the unusual step by the Communists of 
making public a telephone conversation between Mieczyslaw Rakowski, first 
secretary of the Polish Communist Party, and Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
According to party spokesmen here, Gorbachev told Rakowski that it is 
impossible to have a government without Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The party spokesmen said that in a "friendly conversation" that lasted 40 
minutes, Gorbachev "expressed confidence that the Polish (Communist) party 
would successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest of 
socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems is impossible 
without the Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's words, as quoted by party officials here, appeared to stop short of 
a directive. But it is generally believed here that Jaruzelski's agreement on 
the formation of a Solidarity government could not have come without 
Gorbachev's assent. In that light, Solidarity leaders could be expected to 
weigh carefully Gorbachev's views on the Polish situation. His comments to 
Rakowski were the first attributed to him on the shift in power. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki did not indicate how many Cabinet seats he might give the 
Communists, but some deputies in the Sejm said Tuesday that the party is 
pushing for the post of deputy prime minister plus three or four ministries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Communists are trying to retain control of state radio and 
television. This is likely to generate heated contention, because Solidarity's 
activists are equally eager to get the Communists out of executive positions in 
radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
What Mazowiecki said Wednesday may be read partly as a response to Gorbachev 
and pressure from the Communists, but it also reflects the moderate core of the 
Solidarity leadership, which he represents. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity moderates have cautioned that change in Poland should come about 
"not by revolution but by evolution" and have urged a gradual transition from 
the Communist system. And although the change to a Solidarity-led government is 
taking place peacefully, a sharp upending of power alignments could bring 
difficulties for Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inexperienced in Governing 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity moderates have been saying since the elections in June that they are 
inexperienced in running a government. Some have expressed concern that 
Communist bureaucrats, faced with political and professional oblivion, could 
obstruct the new government. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of them argue, the reform-minded elements of the party 
could be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki touched on the issue in his remarks to the Solidarity deputies. He 
said there would be "no witch hunts" by his government and that the criteria 
for employment would be "competence and loyalty to the new government." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said he had Jaruzelski's assurance that army and security forces 
would cooperate with Solidarity. He said "there is a feeling of danger" within 
those forces that must not be aggravated if the democratization of Poland is to 
be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"This is political wisdom not to increase this feeling of danger and not to 
create a feeling of aggression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki spent most of Wednesday meeting with Solidarity leaders and 
representatives of the United Peasants' and Democratic parties. The discussions 
centered on appointments to the new government. The United Peasants' Party is 
hoping for at least four ministries and the Democrats for two. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki told the Solidarity group Wednesday that he hopes to have the 
government organized within a week.

12-YEAR GRAND TOUR BEGINS TO END; 
</P>
<P>
JPL INTERPLANETARY TEAM LOOKS BACK ON VOYAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A dozen years. Time enough for a toddler to become a teen-ager, for a fledgling 
scientist to become a veteran, for arcane technologies to become everyday. Time 
enough for an 1,800-pound package of primitive electronics to skate more than 4 
billion miles toward the stars. 
</P>
<P>
And time enough for the 300 people who remain part of the Voyager 2 team to 
take stock of memories built up over years of planning, engineering and 
executing their grand tour of four planets. Especially for the estimated 10 to 
20 scientists and engineers who have been around since the very beginning, the 
tour's finale at Neptune this week is a time of bittersweet recollection. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (Andy) Collins, 42, is one of those whose careers was built on Voyager; 
in 1970 he came to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a 23-year-old, straight out 
of college, and then joined the Voyager planning team shortly after the program 
began in 1972. He has since moved on to supervise JPL's development of light 
detection equipment for other space missions. 
</P>
<P>
Collins remembers that his son, Brian, now 12, said one of his first words in 
1979 when Voyager flew by the solar system's largest planet: "Jupiper." 
</P>
<P>
"He's our launch boy," Collins said, explaining that Brian was born a few 
months before Voyager's launch in August, 1977. "And our daughter, we think of 
her as Encounter plus 20 days, because she was born 20 days after the second 
Jupiter flyby. And our latest is Encounter minus 17 days." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Collins was born Aug. 7, as the laboratory in Pasadena geared up for 
Voyager 2's pass by Neptune. That close encounter will come at 8:56 p.m. 
tonight, when Voyager will fly just 3,000 miles from Neptune's swirling clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Neptune mission will not be considered finished until Oct. 2, the 
close approach marks the beginning of the end of a program that has changed not 
just astronomy textbooks but also the lives of those who have been dedicated to 
it. Their days, they say, will always carry reminders of Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
"Voyager has spoiled me for anything else," Collins said. "I'm reconciled to 
the fact that whatever comes next probably won't be nearly as satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager experience has also shaped the life of Christopher P. Jones, 
section manager for guidance and control systems at JPL. He joined Voyager in 
1973, one year after the program officially began. 
</P>
<P>
All the years of planning for every conceivable disaster in Voyager's clunky 
computers -- something he now does for all JPL missions -- changed his 
personality, Jones said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have contingency plans. I'm always thinking ahead, and never 
optimistically," Jones said. He checks to see if there is air in the spare 
tire. He builds time into his schedule so he will not be late. He knows which 
route he will take if the freeway off-ramp is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes across as a pessimistic view of life, but in fact it's more insurance 
than anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and his colleagues had to imagine every improbable glitch along the 
4.4-billion-mile journey to Neptune, equipping Voyager's six computers both for 
frontier science and to correct problems as they developed. But they only had 
28,000 bytes of computer memory to do it with -- 35 times less than the memory 
of Jones' desktop computer of today. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, now that scientists can stop worrying about nursing the aging 
spacecraft past another planet, they can sit back and laugh affectionately at 
its outdated technology. 
</P>
<P>
When Voyager 1 and 2 flew by Jupiter in 1979, the days before George 
Lucas-style supercomputer graphics, the Voyager team used laborious techniques 
to make a motion picture of the rotating gases and famous red spot, Collins 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen images taken in sequence were processed individually at JPL, with 
extra care taken so they would all be in the same scale. The images were given 
to a film recorder to be converted into large transparencies. These then were 
trundled off to a Hollywood animation house, where they were sequenced onto 
film -- "like Disney would do," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"VCRs weren't what they are today. Back then, if you didn't have 16-millimeter 
film, nobody would know how to show it," Collins said. "Today, you'd do the 
processing, record the images right onto a videodisc and play them onto 
videotape." Instant movie. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's television cameras, called vidicons, also find it hard to get 
respect. Although they were the state of the art in the late 1960s, their light 
sensitivity is many times less than that of the silicon-chip-based cameras that 
have since become standard fare of home videotapers, noted Bradford A. Smith of 
the University of Arizona, leader of the imaging team since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"You just couldn't even compare the two," Smith said. "Vidicons are just the 
last thing in the world that anyone would want to fly." 
</P>
<P>
For Linda Horn, infrared experiment specialist for Voyager, the mission opened 
up a magical world that she had dreamed about since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a little telescope when I was a girl, and I used to look at the planets 
and the stars," said Horn, who joined the Voyager team shortly before the 1977 
launch. "To actually come to JPL, get on a space mission and then go to the 
launch -- talk about enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
She and others involved with Voyager emphasize the team nature of the project, 
the kind of effort that makes lifelong friends. 
</P>
<P>
Said Collins: "It was always staffed with just enough people. By that I mean 
everyone had to do his job well, because there wasn't a second person there to 
do it for them. So you develop a lot of good relationships with your 
co-workers." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of the end of something unique and wondrous is common among these 
interplanetary pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to go back to Neptune in our lifetimes," Jones said. "To be 
able to participate in an enterprise like Voyager is a special, one-time 
chance. It's like being around when Columbus discovered America." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he remains convinced that Voyager is scientifically the most 
productive, most exciting space mission ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at Neptune," Smith said. "The whole system is so photogenic and so 
exciting. You've got the atmosphere which is much more active than what we had 
ever expected it to be. There are dynamics there that we don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes missions exciting. If you immediately understand what you're 
looking at, that's no fun. It's when you see things that just leave you lying 
awake at night thinking about them, and then you eventually figure out what 
it's all about -- that's the fun part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Charley Kohlhase, mission design manager and a primary mover in Voyager since 
the early days, is spending this week careening from scientific meeting to 
press briefing to official reception, trying not to look too rumpled for the TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
One morning early in the week, he paused briefly to talk about both the 
excitement and the sadness he is feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just exhilarating now. The problem will come next Monday or Tuesday," 
Kohlhase said. "The press will pick up and leave, all the trailers will go. 
We'll look at Neptune and it'll be shrinking smaller and smaller in the 
pictures, and even only barely be seen as a small crescent. And we'll know that 
the last big picture show is ended." 
</P>
<P>
His comfort comes not from looking forward to other space missions, but from 
turning homeward. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a grandson only a year and a half old, and I love to go hiking in the 
Sierra," he said. "Ten or 12 years from now I'll be hiking, and some night 
after the sun's down and the stars are up and I'm telling him stories, I'm 
going to look up and see Sirius." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager will be headed toward Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, after 
it leaves our solar system. "And I'll reflect back and tell him stories that he 
can share and pass on to the generations," Kohlhase said, "and I guess amaze 
him a little bit."

The presidents of Brazil and Argentina agreed to dramatically increase trade 
between their countries and work together to solve their economic problems. 
"Unity is no longer a distant desire. . . . It is the means to end the vicious 
circle of dependence," Brazilian President Jose Sarney declared to his 
country's congress after signing an accord for bilateral integration on the 
second day of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem's visit to Brasilia. The 
two leaders signed 15 documents to revitalize and increase trade between the 
nations.

Chile's President Augusto Pinochet warned political parties against any attempt 
to remove him from the army command or to bring charges against the armed 
forces for alleged human rights abuses when he hands over the government to 
civilian rule next March. The armed forces would demand the constitutional 
right of their chiefs to stay at their posts for eight more years to be upheld, 
the general said. The military would also reject any attempt to review an 
amnesty law covering alleged violations committed following the 1973 military 
coup, Pinochet, 73, added. "Under no circumstances will (the armed forces) 
allow one of their members to be vilified or humiliated for actions carried out 
to save Chile," he said.

Reputed drug lord Howard (Pappy) Mason was indicted on federal racketeering 
charges in the 1988 execution-style slaying of rookie Officer Edward Byrne, 
authorities said. Mason, who is in state prison, was charged with masterminding 
the killing of Byrne, 22, who was shot five times in the head while guarding 
the home of a witness in a drug case. Byrne was killed Feb. 26, 1988, the day 
after Mason was arrested on gun possession charges. Four young men -- all 
admitted crack dealers -- were convicted of the slaying, which prosecutors 
believe was ordered by Mason in retaliation for his imprisonment. The four are 
serving state prison terms of 25 years to life.

Plainclothes Israeli troops firing from unmarked cars shot and killed a 
Palestinian activist in Gaza City as he was confiscating Israeli-issued 
identity cards, witnesses said. At least two cars raced onto a bridge in the 
city's Sheik Radwan district where masked Arab youths were seizing the cards, 
and their occupants fired from the windows, hitting Iyad Ibrahim Abu Kamal, 18, 
in the head, the witnesses said. The magnetic plastic cards, without which Gaza 
men cannot travel to work in Israel, have become the center of a vicious 
struggle between Israeli occupation officials and Palestinian activists.

After months of grieving for his dead companion, Laguna Beach Mayor Robert 
Gentry conquered his worst fears and picked up the phone to get the results of 
his AIDS blood test. He tested negative for the virus that causes the incurable 
disease. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome took the life of Gentry's 15-year 
companion, Gary Burdick, on Jan. 23. "I don't know if anyone knows what it's 
like to even consider testing after you've just buried someone who you have 
cared for and nurtured for 15 years," Gentry said. Gentry is the only openly 
homosexual public official to be elected in Orange County.

FAIL-SAFE MACHINERY URGED FOR JET DOORS

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the use of redundant 
fail-safe mechanisms on airliner cargo door latches to prevent the doors from 
popping open in flight and to assure that they are properly closed before 
takeoffs. The safety board said its investigation of an apparent cargo door 
failure last February in which nine people aboard a United Airlines flight were 
killed shows the original design of the doors on Boeing 747 models "does not 
provide for the fail-safe features intended." It recommended redundant 
indicators to directly pinpoint the position of latch cams on the cargo doors. 
The board also said torque-limiting devices should be installed to prevent 
damage to the lock mechanisms during cargo door operation. No final 
determination has been made of the cause of the United accident.

AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, United Mine Workers President Richard L. 
Trumka and 15 other labor leaders were arrested while demonstrating on behalf 
of striking Pittston coal miners in Virginia. Pittston, which argues it needs a 
contract with more flexibility to compete in overseas markets, broke off talks 
last week to protest what it called an increase in union violence. The contract 
dispute focuses more on benefits and scheduling than wages. The labor leaders 
sat down to block the double doors of the Russell County, Va., Courthouse. 
After refusing to disperse, they were arrested and charged with obstructing the 
free passage of others, a misdemeanor.

A Soviet newspaper called Yuri V. Andropov the "last Stalinist" boss in the 
first open criticism of the former Soviet leader, considered at home and in the 
West as a reformer and mentor of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Komsomolskaya 
Pravda, the daily of the Communist Youth League, also pulled the wraps off 
Andropov's 15-year career as the head of the KGB secret police, calling him 
"the most enigmatic figure" of the Leonid I. Brezhnev era. Andropov, who ruled 
just 15 months in 1982-83, instituted a crackdown on loafers by sending police 
into movie houses, bathhouses and stores to nab the idlers.

YEAR AFTER FBI CAPITOL RAID, ETHICS MEASURES OKD BY 2 COMMITTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One year after the FBI raided the Capitol in an investigation of political 
corruption, two legislative committees unanimously approved wide-ranging 
measures Wednesday to clean up the Legislature's tarnished image and curb its 
members' most flagrant ethical abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, concluding eight months of meetings, 
formally adopted a package that would limit the gifts and speaking fees that 
legislators can receive and impose tougher enforcement of ethics violations. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the Senate Rules Committee approved a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would ask voters to ban honorariums for legislators while 
establishing a salary commission to decide on the level of compensation that 
all state elected officials should receive. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the legislation said they hope to reconcile differences between the 
two measures and rush them through the Legislature by Sept. 15, when both 
houses adjourn for the year. 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen whether rank-and-file legislators are willing to vote 
for legislation that would restrict their own lucrative speaking fees, free 
travel to foreign countries and a wide array of gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"If this package passes, there will be nothing like it in the country," said 
Common Cause lobbyist Walter Zelman after the Assembly committee approved its 
plan. "There is more they could do, but from a realistic point of view, you 
have to be very impressed with how far they've moved." 
</P>
<P>
While the Assembly plan is more restrictive and detailed than the Senate 
measure, both proposals are designed to reduce the amount of money and gifts 
legislators receive from individuals and businesses that have an interest in 
bills before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the Legislature's current interest in ethics legislation was 
sparked by the FBI's political corruption investigation, which so far has led 
to the indictment of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) and a former top aide, 
Amiel Jaramillo, on 12 felony counts of racketeering, extortion and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's investigation, which began as an undercover operation in 1985, became 
public in dramatic fashion a year ago today when federal agents made a 
late-night raid of legislators' Capitol offices. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the investigation has widened as federal authorities look for links 
between lawmakers' votes on specific bills and payments they may have received 
from individuals affected by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
At least five elected officials continue to be subjects of the investigation: 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and 
state Board of Equalization member Paul Carpenter, a former Democratic state 
senator from Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a healthy movement within the Legislature to take a long hard look at 
the way we and other state elected officials do public business," said Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) as he urged the Senate Rules 
Committee to adopt stricter ethical standards. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Assembly proposal would hold to legislators to the same 
conflict-of-interest laws that apply to local government officials throughout 
the state. However, the Assembly panel rejected a proposal to turn over 
enforcement to the Fair Political Practices Commission, which polices conflict 
of interest violations among local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the attorney general or local district attorneys would be given 
authority to enforce laws prohibiting legislators from voting on matters that 
would affect their own personal finances. In certain cases, prosecution could 
be turned over to an independent counsel. In addition, the plan calls for the 
creation of an Assembly Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to oversee 
legislators' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly package, which was drafted in an unusual series of public 
meetings, also calls for an immediate limit of $1,000 on individual 
honorariums, with each legislator's total annual honorariums not to exceed 
$10,200. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, legislators would not be able to accept gifts of more than $100 
from a single source per year, with exceptions for such items as presents from 
family members, under the Assembly plan. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts of foreign travel would be allowed only if they come from a foreign 
government or a bona fide educational institution, or if they receive special 
approval in advance from the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have put together the first comprehensive ethics conduct program," said 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Select 
Committee on Ethics, after the panel voted 8 to 0 to approve the package. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Senate proposal, the Assembly plan calls for a constitutional 
amendment to be placed before the voters next year that would create a 
commission to decide what compensation legislators should receive. Many 
lawmakers support the commission plan because they believe that they are 
underpaid and that an independent commission would give them a hefty raise. 
</P>
<P>
Under both the Assembly and Senate proposals, voter approval of the salary 
commission would mean a ban on all honorariums for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals also would prohibit former legislators from lobbying the 
Legislature for 12 months after leaving office, and prohibit former top 
Administration officials from lobbying the executive branch for the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Assembly plan, however, most of the Senate proposal is contingent on 
approval by the voters. A proposed $250 annual restriction on gifts, the ban on 
honorariums and the prohibition on lobbying by former officials would not take 
effect unless voters agree to create the salary commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate proposal, sponsored by Roberti and Senate Republican Leader Ken 
Maddy of Fresno, was approved by the Rules Committee on a 5-0 vote.

START OF SCHOOL MAY WORSEN MEASLES SPREAD, EXPERTS SAY

SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stubborn measles outbreak that has plagued much of Southern California for 
two years has flared this summer in the Inland Empire, causing two deaths and 
prompting concern that the disease could spread still faster with the start of 
the school year next month. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the rubeola, or "10-day measles," epidemic has been San 
Bernardino County, where more than 500 cases have been reported since October. 
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has swept through three San Bernardino County jails as well as the 
California Institution for Men in Chino, claiming the lives of two inmates and 
prompting mass inoculations of those who work and are housed in the detention 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Euler, a county epidemiologist tracking the outbreak, said the disease has 
struck residents in 18 widely scattered cities, from San Bernardino to Big 
Bear, and has so far defied efforts to stop its spread. 
</P>
<P>
While San Bernardino recorded about 32 cases annually over the last decade, the 
county has been struck by an average of 100 new cases a month since June. An 
unusually high rate of one in three patients has required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing what we can to get people immunized, but so far we don't have a 
handle on it," Euler said. "I don't think anyone has the answer as to why this 
has just taken off here." 
</P>
<P>
The Southland epidemic surfaced in August, 1987, and was initially centered in 
Los Angeles County. Since then, it has fanned out to include the Inland Empire 
as well as Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 cases have been recorded so far, with the majority occurring in 
1989. Eleven deaths -- nine in Los Angeles County spread over two years and two 
in San Bernardino since June -- have been definitively linked to the epidemic, 
while at least six other fatalities may be related, health authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jail Inmate 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, 93 people have contracted measles since the first reported 
case in April. After a jail inmate came down with the disease and quickly 
infected two others, officials launched a mandatory immunization program, 
inoculating 1,500 inmates and staff members. Transfers within the jail system 
were also limited in order to reduce exposure to the highly contagious rubeola 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
County epidemiologist Randy Regester said Riverside's outbreak was initially 
concentrated in the region's eastern reaches, near Indio, but quickly spread 
west. He said public health nurses have interviewed all of the victims and have 
alerted anyone with whom they had contact. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been real aggressive on the case investigation end of things in hopes of 
keeping control of it," Regester said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County health authorities say the measles outbreak there is the worst in 
11 years. Dr. L. Rex Ehling, a county health officer, said 307 cases have been 
reported in 1989, about triple the number recorded the previous year. Ehling 
also said one death had been linked to the outbreak, but he could provide no 
details and state officials could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
70 People Ill 
</P>
<P>
Unlike San Bernardino, Orange County has seen the measles rate dip since its 
peak in May, a month in which more than 70 people became ill. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true in Los Angeles County. In mid-spring, more than 100 cases 
monthly were the norm, but this summer, only about 40 new victims have been 
stricken each month. 
</P>
<P>
The spread of the disease also has slowed in San Diego County. The outbreak 
peaked there in early spring but has faded almost completely, with fewer than a 
dozen cases in July. In all, there have been about 160 measles victims in San 
Diego in 1989, more than double the number in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rubeola, or red measles, is a highly infectious viral disease characterized by 
a rash that covers the body. Its symptoms typically last 10 days, unlike those 
of rubella, or German measles, which persist about three days. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Loring Dales, chief of the immunization unit for the state Department of 
Health Services, said the Southland epidemic is the most serious to strike 
California since 1977 and resembles those that have hit New York, Newark, N.J., 
and Miami in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims have been preschool-aged children in poor, inner-city 
neighborhoods, where public education about immunization is often deficient. 
Children under age 3 are particularly vulnerable to the high fever and 
bronchial infection associated with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult outbreak to contain," Dales said, noting that 
the cases have been geographically diffuse. "It's not like we can target one 
area and go door to door." 
</P>
<P>
The disease has also caused an abnormally high number of fatalities and has 
brought unusually severe symptoms, with 20% of the victims suffering pneumonia 
and the same ratio requiring hospitalization. Typically, 5% of measles victims 
need hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Battles 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more cases of measles have been reported this year than in any year 
since 1980, according to the national Centers for Disease Control. Chicago and 
Houston are waging particularly tough battles against the virus, with 4,000 
cases and six deaths between them in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Although rubeola usually attacks elementary schoolchildren, one-fourth of the 
San Bernardino County victims have been adults. Many of these have been jail 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
While 85% to 90% of the young adult population is immune to measles, "when you 
have barracks-type living, like in a jail, measles will find the 10% to 15% who 
aren't protected," said Dales of the state health agency. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, Euler said officials instituted a mandatory 
inoculation program in the jails and there have been no new cases since 
immunizations were halted last week. There was one case at the county's 
Juvenile Hall two weeks ago, however, so authorities immunized nearly all of 
the 340 youths at that facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Challenge 
</P>
<P>
With the first day of school not far off, health officials face a new 
challenge: "You couldn't dream up a better way to spread measles than a school 
setting, with all those kids mixing all the time," Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Cole, supervising public health nurse for Riverside County, said the 
Health Department will offer low-cost vaccinations at a special back-to-school 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, where outbreaks occurred at 46 schools, any student 
lacking proper immunization records will be barred from school, Euler said.

HONIG SUPPORTING MOVE TO LIFT LIMIT ON STATE SPENDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig left the neutral corner and threw 
his support Wednesday behind the campaign to win voter approval of a 
constitutional amendment to lift the state spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who just last month hinted that he might not support the proposed 
measure in next June's primary election, said in a letter to Gov. George 
Deukmejian that he would be "pleased" to join the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian welcomed his one-time political adversary to the "team" that 
supports the $18.5-billion, 10-year transportation plan that would be 
implemented if the spending limit is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be more pleased to learn of Bill's support, and while still 
realizing we have a tough job in front of us, I am further convinced that 
gaining voter approval of SCA 1 is realistic and doable," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Backing for this measure is beginning to snowball," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Republican governor met privately with legislative 
leaders for 90 minutes to set priorities for the final three weeks of this 
year's session. They discussed the campaign to pass the ballot measure, plus 
legislation on health insurance, a plan to overhaul the state's $8-billion 
workers' compensation system, solid waste disposal and budget vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders said the governor asked them to round up financial and 
political support for the ballot measure. They also said that Deukmejian 
reported he intends to head the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and legislative leaders put the proposed constitutional amendment 
together in June as part of a complex package tying together implementation of 
Proposition 98, the landmark school funding measure approved by voters last 
year, with a transportation expansion program requiring a proposed 
9-cents-a-gallon hike in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
Honig's support was widely viewed as a big boost to the campaign to pass the 
measure to remove the ban on spending. Other school interests, particularly the 
California Teachers Assn., are still studying the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), who carried the legislation putting the 
spending limit measure on the June ballot, said, "Honig is a key in obtaining 
education support" for the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi is carrying follow-up legislation to the Proposition 98 
implementation bill. The bill was taken off the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee agenda Wednesday for amendments. Garamendi said he had made no deals 
in return for his support for the ballot proposition. "I haven't made any 
promises to the superintendent, but I think his concerns will be addressed," 
Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, it was learned that the Associated General 
Contractors of California has agreed to raise $1 million of the $5 million that 
supporters of the spending limit modification proposal say they will need to 
finance the campaign to pass the spending measure. 
</P>
<P>
The association's president, Carl Otto, has already made a strong appeal to his 
membership for contributions. Writing in an association newsletter, Otto said, 
"Traditionally, we have been awful in our performance, coming no where close to 
the (financial) commitments made." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First-Line Beneficiaries' 
</P>
<P>
Otto added, "We cannot let that happen this time," noting that "as the 
first-line beneficiaries of $18.5 billion in transportation funding, we must 
set the example for others to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Honig had adopted a neutral position because he said he felt the plan to 
implement Proposition 98 might cut too deeply into gains the schools made when 
voters passed the school funding measure. He said he wanted something more from 
the governor and Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, Honig said he was basically satisfied with the compromise on 
Proposition 98 implementation because the deal would still guarantee that 
schools will receive at least 40% to 41% of state tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get everything we wanted, but we got the essence of what we wanted," 
Honig said during an interview. He also said his support was not conditioned on 
getting further concessions in Proposition 98 implementation legislation or any 
other promises from either Deukmejian or lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Deukmejian, Honig noted that he had long sought changes in the 
spending limit in order "to meet the future needs of the state." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Deukmejian and legislative leaders was their first since 
lawmakers returned from their monthlong summer recess Monday.

FUROR ERUPTS OVER CLAIM BY INSURANCE COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A furor erupted Wednesday over a bill adopted last year by the Legislature and 
signed by Gov. George Deukmejian that some insurance industry lawyers are 
saying should be construed as allowing the companies a rate of return on auto 
insurance twice the 11.2% standard set by Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers are making that argument in filings with Gillespie's office 
seeking to justify their current rates. 
</P>
<P>
But if Gillespie agrees with the industry arguments, a Consumers Union official 
contended, she will authorize huge increases in auto premiums when she gains 
the authority to approve future rates beginning Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), the author of the legislation, insisted in 
interviews Wednesday that he did not realize that his bill would be interpreted 
in that fashion and he said he will seek next week to revive a bill that he 
says will clarify the original legislation's intent. 
</P>
<P>
However, just the day before, on Tuesday, Bane had agreed to put his 
clarification bill over until next year. Wednesday, he charged that he had been 
misled by "those stinking little so and sos" in the Assn. of California 
Insurance Companies, the state's leading insurance lobby, into believing that 
it was safe to wait that long. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Levy, an official of the association, responded that his lobbying group does 
oppose the Bane clarification. He said it is satisfied with the 1988 bill's 
language as an expression of state policy. But he said of Bane's claim about 
being misled, "I didn't mislead him. You're darn right I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Bane's 1988 bill was described at the time as an excess profits bill to force 
companies to rebate premiums to customers if the insurers realized an 
underwriting profit of more than 5%. (Underwriting profit is the difference 
between total premiums collected and all company expenses, including claims 
paid.) Underwriting profits seldom reach the 5% level in the California auto 
insurance business. Most of the companies' income is derived instead from 
interest on investments made with the premiums collected. Bane's bill did not 
mention investment income. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill contained a provision stating: "The Legislature has determined 
that the prima facie reasonable rate of return for underwriting of private 
passenger automobile insurance is an after-tax profit of 5% of earned premium." 
That language was amended into the bill by Bane in the last days of the 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent rate filing with Gillespie, attorneys for the Allstate company 
contended that this language sets state policy and "translates into returns on 
equity for Allstate of 27.8% for auto liability and 18.4% for auto physical 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
This would average out to at least twice the 11.2% standard Gillespie has 
enunciated in recent news conferences as constituting the "fair rate of return" 
the state Supreme Court told her in May should be applied to premiums under 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
An Allstate spokesman said Wednesday that actually the company lawyers were not 
arguing for a rate of return as high as 27.8% and were merely reminding 
Gillespie that this was the figure determined as fair by state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Allstate had noted in its filings that the commissioner 
might set an overall rate of return for auto insurance as low as 19%. 
</P>
<P>
This would still, however, be higher than what the insurers are getting now, 
and morethan 70% higher than Gillespie's 11.2% standard. A Consumers Union 
official, Judith Bell, said Wednesday that her organization has heard other 
companies' lawyers are picking up the Allstate argument. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Insurance Commissioner Ray Bacon said, meanwhile, that he had discussed 
the matter with Bane and that the assemblyman "didn't realize this was in his 
bill. He forgot to include investment income." 
</P>
<P>
Bane said he indeed had been unaware what his bill would do, and Wednesday 
afternoon asked state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) to put his clarification 
bill back on his committee calendar for next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's Demand 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another development in the insurance issue, Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of Voter Revolt and author of Proposition 103, demanded, in the wake of 
Gillespie's statements Tuesday that hundreds of insurance companies are likely 
to be exempted from rate rollbacks, that Deukmejian either fire Gillespie or 
explain why he continues to support her. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's press secretary, Kevin Brett, responded: 
</P>
<P>
"Who's Harvey Rosenfield? We haven't heard of him. The last time we checked he 
was not a member of the governor's senior staff. If he thinks the governor is 
going to take his advice, he's dreaming."

FRANCE WALKING TIGHTROPE BETWEEN LEBANON FACTIONS

<P>
The French government is walking a political tightrope between Lebanese 
Christians who think a French naval force off Lebanon is their military 
salvation and pro-Syrian Lebanese militias who see it as an invasion fleet. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in three days, French President Francois Mitterrand 
insisted Wednesday that the eight warships, including the aircraft carrier 
Foch, are being sent into Lebanese waters as part of a "rescue mission," 
concerned primarily with 7,000 French citizens living in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Some pretend to confuse the rescue mission with a military action," Mitterrand 
told members of the Cabinet. "Others wrongly think the French navy is at their 
disposal. No country or group has the right to dictate what France should do as 
far as Lebanon is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cartoonists' Field Day 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and cartoonists have been having a field day with the 
government's ambiguous intentions. A cartoon in the newspaper Le Monde shows 
Mitterrand talking to a pilot in a French warplane heavily armed with missiles 
and bombs. "Try not to look too mean," he tells the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Mitterrand's statements, made Wednesday in Paris and 
earlier in Spain, apparently is to project a position of neutrality between the 
Christian and pro-Syrian Muslim forces. 
</P>
<P>
When Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who is on an extended trip to the South 
Pacific, suggested that the French ships might be used to take military action 
if necessary, Mitterrand, in Madrid, quickly shot back: 
</P>
<P>
"I reject the idea that we can act militarily with ships fulfilling a 
humanitarian mission." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered to Lebanon 
</P>
<P>
The French naval operation began Aug. 15 when the frigate Duquesne, armed with 
missiles, was ordered to the Lebanese coast. The Duquesne and two other ships 
are said to have arrived and were expected to be joined soon by the carrier 
Foch, which is capable of carrying 40 aircraft, and four other ships. 
</P>
<P>
The differing views of what France expects to achieve has put Rocard's 
Socialist government in a delicate position. But Mitterrand so far has heard 
little serious criticism. 
</P>
<P>
France has a long history of intervention in Lebanon, which it ruled as a 
League of Nations protectorate until 1943. Lebanese political interests, 
particularly on the French-speaking Christian side, run deep in France; 
Lebanese businessmen are active and generous contributors to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The naval mission is justified and appropriate," said center-right opposition 
leader Didier Bariani, who is the mayor of one of the districts of Paris. 
"Effective help is the most effective method in a place where some want to 
commit genocide." 
</P>
<P>
In their background briefings, French officials contend that their main purpose 
in mounting the mission to Lebanon is to "wake up" the rest of the world, 
including the United States, to the problems in Lebanon.

ALGERIAN HIJACKS FRENCH JETLINER -- ARMED WITH A CAN OF SHAVING CREAM

An Algerian expelled from France hijacked an Air France jetliner carrying more 
than 100 people Wednesday by threatening to blow up the plane, but he 
surrendered peacefully, and his "bomb" turned out to be a bar of soap and a can 
of shaving cream. 
</P>
<P>
Said Djamel, a 30-year-old merchant, gave up soon after the A-300 Airbus landed 
at Algiers airport, its original destination, at 2:20 p.m. The 115 passengers 
and crew disembarked unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Algerian officials said Djamel had threatened to blow up the plane with a 
package hidden under his jacket. But before police led him away, he showed 
reporters a plastic bag he said contained only a can of shaving cream and a bar 
of soap. 
</P>
<P>
Holding an impromptu news conference on the tarmac, Djamel said he had acted to 
draw world attention to the plight of Lebanese and Palestinians and to demand 
an international conference on the Lebanese crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Palestinians Who Die' 
</P>
<P>
"There are Palestinians who die every day. Let us come to an understanding, sit 
at a table, discuss and finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what his demands were, Djamel said: "On the one hand, an international 
conference on Lebanon. In Palestine, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has directly 
recognized Israel. . . . Let there be a dialogue between the PLO and the 
Israeli government." 
</P>
<P>
Early reports of the hijacking prompted speculation that it had been mounted by 
a Middle East group angered by France's decision to send a naval task force to 
Lebanon, a French protectorate between the two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
Algerian police said Djamel has used the alias Bendada. The French news agency 
Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified sources in Paris, said he was 
expelled from France for disturbing the peace and said he "displayed great 
agitation" before being put on the flight to Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Joseph Vallat, however, said the hijacker was calm and well-dressed and 
never left his seat. 
</P>
<P>
According to Vallat, Air France Flight 2323 from Paris to Algiers was over 
Perpignan in southwestern France when a flight attendant rushed into the 
cockpit with a note scribbled by the hijacker, demanding that "the aircraft be 
diverted to Tunis." 
</P>
<P>
Tunisian authorities refused to let the plane land. It turned back to Algiers, 
where the drama ended after 20 minutes of talks between the hijacker and 
Algerian authorities, Vallat said. 
</P>
<P>
The jet came to a halt at the end of an abandoned runway at the edge of the 
airport, and some passengers were unaware that they had been hijacked until 
they saw the plane ringed with troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what was happening. I thought maybe there had been mechanical 
trouble," said Algerian passenger Moulud Ghondjil.

U.S.-SOVIET EFFORT FOR LEBANON URGED

Accusing the Bush Administration of taking a timid and unimaginative approach 
to Lebanon's escalating violence, Lebanese Ambassador Abdullah Bouhabib called 
on the United States and the Soviet Union on Wednesday to launch a joint 
diplomatic campaign to force the warring factions to accept a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the superpowers to back up peace-making appeals with the threat of 
economic sanctions against Syria and any other foreign powers contributing to 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a small country -- 10 million people," Bouhabib told a small group of 
reporters. "If the world really meant to solve the controversy, are you saying 
they could not? A joint declaration would carry more weight than the Americans 
alone or the Russians alone." 
</P>
<P>
He said that such a superpower initiative, unthinkable a decade ago, is now 
possible because of the growing U.S.-Soviet dialogue on regional issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Case Anymore' 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, many times we tried to involve the Russians, and the United 
States refused," Bouhabib said. "This is not the case anymore." 
</P>
<P>
While it is unusual for ambassadors to plead openly for foreign intervention in 
their own countries, Bouhabib said the fighting has become so bitter that 
superpower intervention may be the only solution. 
</P>
<P>
Bouhabib was named ambassador to Washington in 1983 by then-Lebanese President 
Amin Gemayel. Since Gemayel's term ended, two rival regimes -- one led by the 
Christian army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, and the other by Salim Hoss, 
the Muslim premier under Gemayel -- have each claimed to be the legitimate 
government of Lebanon. The United States deals with both groups but refuses to 
say which it recognizes as the government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the chaotic situation in Beirut, Bouhabib continues to be accepted by 
the Administration as Lebanon's official spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the State Department has blamed Syria and its Lebanese Muslim 
militia allies for the escalation of hostilities, especially murderous 
artillery barrages. The department has called on all sides to abide by a 
cease-fire, but Bouhabib said that Washington has not taken any action to back 
its words. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States we have seen a lot of denunciations (of violence) and 
sympathy for Lebanon, but we have not seen any concerted action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviets More Forthcoming 
</P>
<P>
Bouhabib noted that the Soviet Union has become more "forthcoming" than it used 
to be, but he said that Moscow, too, has stopped short of the sort of bold 
action that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official shrugged off the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear from a lot of people that we are not doing enough," he said. "We feel 
we are doing what we can. We feel diplomatic moves are what should be done." 
</P>
<P>
Bouhabib agreed that the superpower intervention should be diplomatic and not 
military. His complaint, he added, is that past diplomacy has been ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. military intervention in the past, we see now in retrospect, was a 
mistake," the ambassador said. "We don't want to see that repeated."

ISRAEL ALARMED BY REPORT OF AID TO COLOMBIA DRUG ASSASSINS 
</P>

Israel's government reacted with alarm Wednesday to reports that Israeli 
mercenaries may have helped drug dealers in Colombia to train squads to 
assassinate public figures. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent involvement came to light when voices in Hebrew were heard on a 
videotape broadcast by NBC on Tuesday night. The tape, which purportedly 
pictured the training of assassination teams in the service of Colombian drug 
dealers, was reportedly made by the drug lords to show Colombian authorities 
how able their forces are. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Acting on Their Own' 
</P>
<P>
Colombia is in a virtual state of war with the drug cartels following the 
assassination of leading anti-narcotics officials and political figures, 
including Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a top candidate for president who was gunned 
down on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"If the reports are true, they pertain to actions of individuals who are acting 
on their own," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. "Such actions would be in 
violation of Israeli law and would be contrary to Israeli policy, which is 
strongly committed to the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Foreign Ministry, "along with other ministries, is 
checking the facts and will take all possible steps to prevent such 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry sources said the Israeli Embassy in Colombia was notified in 
April of the involvement of Israeli citizens in training hit squads. They said 
the embassy replied that it was beyond its power to do anything about the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli police announced Wednesday that they will ask for information on the 
Israeli mercenaries from U.S. and Colombian anti-drug agencies. Besides the 
Israelis, 11 British citizens are reported to be training the hit teams. 
</P>
<P>
There were hints in the Israeli reaction that military assistance to Latin 
American governments, particularly in Central America, may have spawned 
free-lance cooperation with drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Israel government television identified a man shown instructing a hit squad as 
Yair Klein, a retired colonel. Klein reportedly heads a company called Hod 
Hahanit, which specialized in security and military know-how. The report said 
the company was licensed by Israel's Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest-circulation 
newspaper, any Israeli involvement in Colombia would be of "great worry" to 
Israeli diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Paid 'Hit Men' 
</P>
<P>
"This time," it said, "what is being discussed is not aid to guerrilla units, 
rebels or even fascist governments, as was acceptable up to now in Panama, 
Colombia and other South American countries, but salaried Israeli 'hit men' who 
produce military units that agree to work for drug sellers for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars per person." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's military relations with Latin countries have been shrouded in secrecy 
and are a subject of controversy. As part of its own effort to fund domestic 
military programs, Israel has sold military equipment to every Central American 
country except Belize and to several countries in South America.

Hailed as "nine fallen heroes of peace," the bodies of Rep. Mickey Leland 
(D-Tex.) and eight other Americans killed in an Ethiopian plane crash were 
returned to U.S. soil Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine coffins bearing the bodies of members of a U.S. congressional 
delegation on a hunger mission to Ethiopia were lifted from a military plane at 
Andrews Air Force Base by a joint military honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of over 300, including members of Congress, family members and aides, 
watched the solemn ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
As the coffins were loaded into a row of hearses, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) said: "We gather here to honor nine fallen heroes of peace. Each of 
these talented and able individuals was on a mission of peace, humanity and 
compassion. Let us dedicate ourselves to those values for which they gave their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
The mourners included more than two dozen members of Congress as well as 
Leland's mother, Alice Rains, who wiped tears from her eyes as she held onto 
Leland's brother, Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
A private burial service for Leland, 44, was scheduled for today.

BILL OF RIGHTS A PRODUCT OF POLITICS, NOT PRINCIPLE; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENT, MARKING 200TH YEAR, WAS DESIGNED TO END OPPOSITION TO FEDERALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On this day 200 years ago, the House of Representatives finished writing what 
may be the most memorable and vital phrases of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In a dozen amendments -- 10 of which finally were ratified by the states -- the 
members of the first Congress spelled out a Bill of Rights that specifically 
limited the government's power over its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Americans were guaranteed the right to speak out without fear of the state. 
They could worship as they pleased. Their homes and possessions would not be 
subject to unwarranted "searches and seizures" by federal agents. Today, the 
Bill of Rights is seen by many as this nation's most significant contribution 
to government. 
</P>
<P>
However, this year's debate over whether to trim back one of those rights to 
prohibit the desecration of the U.S. flag has illustrated a telling contrast 
between how the Bill of Rights is viewed now and how it emerged in 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the proposed new constitutional amendment, which was spawned by 
outrage over a recent Supreme Court decision that made flag burning legal as a 
form of free expression, have attacked the measure as a politically inspired 
expedient unworthy of a document that symbolizes a triumph of principle over 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights . . 
. by submitting a proposed amendment which would dilute the protections of the 
First Amendment," U.S. District Judge Louis Pollak said at a Senate hearing 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
But historians point out that it was political pressure, not a devotion to 
philosophical principle, that spurred the first Congress to establish the Bill 
of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of the framing and the ratification of the Bill of Rights 
indicates slight passion on the part of anyone to enshrine personal liberties 
in the fundamental law of the land," Leonard W. Levy of the Claremont Graduate 
School, the foremost historian of the Bill of Rights, has written. "Our 
precious Bill of Rights, at least in its immediate background, resulted from 
the reluctant necessity of certain Federalists (supporters of the new federal 
government) to capitalize on a cause that had been originated, in vain, by the 
anti-federalists for ulterior purposes." 
</P>
<P>
As Congress this fall weighs President Bush's proposed amendment, along with a 
Democratic alternative for a narrower anti-flag burning law, the original 
struggle over the Bill of Rights reflects the blend of motives, political 
maneuvers and ideals that underlay the birth of the Constitution and have 
influenced its evolution since then. 
</P>
<P>
As broad statements of principle, the first 10 amendments reflected the 
strongly held views of Americans regardless of their political stripe. The 
notion of citizens' having "certain inalienable rights" that government could 
not suppress had been first put forth in the Declaration of Independence more 
than a decade earlier, and the Bill of Rights wrote that notion into law. 
</P>
<P>
Still, historians note, it took political attacks by the Constitution's critics 
to make the Bill of Rights a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Two years earlier, when the new plan for a federal government was being drafted 
in Philadelphia, the framers of the Constitution, including James Madison of 
Virginia, had opposed a specific listing of individual rights in the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
They contended that such a listing was unnecessary because the new government 
was to have quite limited powers. Because the government had no authority to 
limit freedom of religion or the press, Madison reasoned, why mention the 
subjects at all and risk getting bogged down in peripheral issues? 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1787, the members of the Constitutional Convention voted down a 
proposed Bill of Rights before approving the final document. 
</P>
<P>
But the so-called anti-federalists, who were staunch advocates of investing 
primary powers in the individual states, rallied opposition to the new 
Constitution by raising the specter of tyrannical central government with 
unlimited power to oppress the people. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a Bill of Rights in the new Constitution nearly caused its defeat. 
Even in Virginia, the home state of Madison and George Washington, the 
Constitution was approved by only 10 votes in the state ratifying convention. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson, who was then in Paris as America's ambassador, also thought 
the Constitution was vulnerable without a Bill of Rights. In a series of 
letters to his friend Madison, he sought to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government 
on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse or 
rest on inference," Jefferson wrote in one letter to Madison. 
</P>
<P>
When the first Congress convened in New York in April, 1789, Madison and other 
Federalists embraced the Bill of Rights to deflate the prospects of states' 
rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
It is a "nauseous project," Madison confided to a friend during the legislative 
struggle, but it "will kill the opposition (to the new central government) 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
However, his colleagues had other priorities. Then, as now, Congress was beset 
by budget deficits, and most members thought that the first order of business 
should be organizing the government and seeking new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Madison persisted. In July, he was given permission to form a committee to 
draw up the amendments. He drew most of the ideas and language from the 
constitutions of various states. In mid-August, the amendments were debated on 
the House floor. On Aug. 24, 17 amendments were approved and sent to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session, which was then the norm for the Senate, the upper house 
pared down the list to 12 amendments. Finally, on Sept. 25, the two houses 
approved the final versions and sent them to the states for ratification.

MURDER EVIDENCE IN TYLENOL CASE TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Parole Commission examiners have recommended that Tylenol extortionist 
James W. Lewis serve his maximum 20-year prison sentence because they believe 
that evidence indicates he was responsible for the unsolved Tylenol murders in 
Chicago seven years ago, his lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was convicted only of writing a letter demanding $1 million to stop 
the killings, law enforcement officials have suggested privately that Lewis was 
a suspect in the murders. The finding by the parole examiners is the first time 
that he has been identified officially as the probable killer. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people died after swallowing Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide in the 
fall of 1982. The capsules were in bottles of the pain reliever purchased at 
different stores in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting nationwide scare cost Tylenol's manufacturer, Johnson &amp; 
Johnson, millions of dollars in lost sales, sparked at least 200 copycat 
incidents and led to tougher packaging standards for over-the-counter 
medicines. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and Parole Commission refused to confirm the 
recommendation by the commission examiners. Spokesmen for both agencies said 
only that Lewis' Sunday parole date has been suspended pending a review of his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago lawyer Donald V. Morano, who represents Lewis, said in a telephone 
interview that the conclusion that Lewis was the probable killer was delivered 
orally by the two examiners at a parole hearing Monday in El Reno, Okla., where 
Lewis is imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that they were recommending that he serve the maximum sentence 
because a preponderance of the evidence indicated that he was the murderer," 
Morano said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a criminal conviction requires evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt, Justice Department spokesman Joseph C. Krovisky said that the less 
stringent "preponderance" standard is used in deciding parole eligibility. 
Krovisky said that preponderance means clear and convincing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
If the recommendation of the examiners is upheld by the nine-member Parole 
Commission, Lewis will spend about seven more years in prison. He was convicted 
of attempted extortion for writing a letter in 1982 to Johnson &amp; Johnson 
demanding $1 million to stop the killings. He was never charged with the 
killings, and they remain unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was sentenced to 10 years for attempted extortion and 10 years for an 
unrelated mail fraud conviction. He has been considered a model prisoner, and 
commission officials in March had approved a parole date of next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. attorney in Chicago and one of the prosecutors in the 
extortion case wrote letters asking the commission to reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Anton R. Valukas wrote that Lewis remained a danger to the public 
and had committed "one of the most heinous and despicable crimes that the 
Northern District of Illinois has experienced." The letter did not accuse Lewis 
of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal prosecutor Jeremy D. Margolis, now director of the Illinois 
State Police, said that his letter did not accuse Lewis of the killings and 
offered no new evidence on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Morano said that authorities are trying to keep Lewis in prison by suggesting 
he is the Tylenol killer because of their inability to solve the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"They have wanted to pin the Tylenol killings on Lewis from the beginning, and 
he did not do it," Morano said. 
</P>
<P>
Since his capture after a nationwide manhunt in 1982, some investigators have 
believed Lewis was the prime suspect in the killings. During two sessions with 
then-prosecutor Margolis after his arrest, Lewis described how someone could 
have filled the Tylenol capsules with cyanide and then distributed them 
randomly at stores. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis later said that he was merely recounting a process described to him by 
drug dealers he had met in prison.

EDUCATION TO COST $353 BILLION IN 1989-90, REPORT SAYS

<P>
The nation's schools and colleges will spend a record $353 billion in the 
coming year, more than double the amount of a decade ago, the government said 
Wednesday in its annual back-to-school report. 
</P>
<P>
Although school enrollments have remained flat nationwide since 1980, the 
report said, spending for education has continued to rise, easily outpacing 
inflation. In the 1979-80 school year, the nation spent $166 billion for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spending Up 29% 
</P>
<P>
After taking inflation into account, spending for the nation's elementary and 
secondary schools has risen 29% since 1980, despite a slight drop in the number 
of students. Meanwhile, higher education spending has risen even faster, 
exceeding the inflation rate by 36%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our nation continues to make a tremendous financial investment in education," 
U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said in issuing the report, "but the 
education deficit continues to grow. Too many Americans remain ill-prepared for 
a changing world." 
</P>
<P>
The Education Department report includes spending and enrollment data for both 
public and private schools and colleges. The figures cited for the 1989-90 year 
are projections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers Better Paid 
</P>
<P>
The spending increases over the decade mainly reflect more and better-paid 
teachers in both schools and colleges, according to the report. This year, 
elementary and secondary schools will employ 2.7 million teachers, up more than 
200,000 since 1980. But they will be teaching 45.6 million students, which is 
723,000 fewer than in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The average salary of a public school teacher will reach $31,200 this year, the 
Education Department said. This is 5.5% higher than last year. Adjusted for 
inflation, the average teacher's salary has gone up 20% since 1980, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But government statisticians contend that the salary increases of the 1980s 
have only made up for declines during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen large increases in teachers' salaries in this decade. But, adjusted 
for inflation, the average salary this year is only slightly higher than in 
1973, which was the peak year," said Tom Snyder, branch chief for the National 
Center for Education Statistics. In the late 1970s, education salaries fell far 
behind soaring inflation rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming school year, it will cost an average of $5,246 to educate each of 
the nation's elementary and secondary school students. This is more than double 
the cost of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total cost of educating a student in a public college or 
university will reach an average of $12,986 this year. The average cost will be 
$20,724 at private colleges and universities, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
California stands out from other states because its school enrollments have 
risen steadily throughout the decade. In most other areas of the nation, the 
number of students has remained steady or declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, California will enroll 4,731,000 children in its public 
schools, up more than 600,000 from 1980, the Education Department said. About 
one in nine of the nation's public school children is enrolled in California, 
according to the report.

PANEL OKS BILLS TO RESOLVE MONO BASIN WATER DISPUTE

Legislation designed to force the city of Los Angeles to resolve its 
long-running dispute with environmentalists over Mono Lake passed a critical 
test Wednesday by winning approval in the Senate Agriculture and Water 
Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
One bill, by Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), would fund $390.8 
million in water projects, including $75 million for the establishment of an 
Environmental Water Fund. It passed 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
The second bill, by Assemblyman William Baker (R-Danville), requires the city, 
the state Water Resources Department and the Mono Lake Committee -- an activist 
group that has been fighting to preserve the Mono Basin -- to agree on a plan 
for protecting the lake's ecosystem. Once agreement is reached, the bill says, 
the city can be granted money from the new Environmental Water Fund which can 
be used to help Los Angeles find replacement sources for water now diverted 
from streams feeding Mono Lake. It passed 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
The bills have been linked so that if one fails, so does the other. But a 
representative of Gov. George Deukmejian asked the committee to split the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me," said Sen. Henry Mello (D-Watsonville), "that one would be 
signed andthe other vetoed." 
</P>
<P>
Department of Water Resources Director David Kennedy said the Administration 
questions why the state "should help the city of Los Angeles do what the courts 
have told it to do." The committee, however, voted to deny the Administration's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills had been stalled in the committee until both the city and the 
Metropolitan Water District agreed to support them. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Mono Lake, in the Eastern Sierra near Yosemite National Park, has been 
the focus of a political tug-of-war between environmentalists and Los Angeles 
for decades. The controversy centers around the city's need to divert water 
from the Mono Basin for millions of customers in Los Angeles and the 
environmentalists' desire to protect the lake's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
For years the environmentalists complained that the city's water diversions 
lowered lake levels so dramatically that they endangered nesting and migratory 
birds that inhabit Negit Island and brine shrimp that thrive in the alkaline 
waters of the million-year-old inland sea. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have steadfastly maintained that the diversions, which provide 
one-seventh of Los Angeles' water supply, have not threatened the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an El Dorado Superior Court judge held in a preliminary injunction 
that the lake level must be raised by nearly two feet. City officials said the 
effect of the ruling would be to force them to temporarily halt diversions, 
since their Mono Basin storage system held only part of the water needed to 
comply with the order.

FEW EXPECTED TO BE ACCEPTED IN AMNESTY'S LAST PHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 200,000 illegal immigrants may apply for amnesty under a separate 
section of the landmark immigration law of 1986, but there is a major catch, 
U.S. immigration officials admitted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very few, if any, will be accepted into the program," Ernest Gustafson, 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's director in Los Angeles, told a 
news conference on the city's Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program -- designed to ensure that there are enough seasonal 
workers for America's farms and ranches -- hinges on whether federal officials 
declare a shortage of such workers. If one is not declared, then no workers 
will be selected, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3 million aliens applied nationwide under the amnesty law's 
general provisions, which are open to a variety of workers including year-round 
agricultural workers. They have until November, 1990, to complete the law's 
Phase II requirements of knowledge of English and U.S. history in order to 
qualify for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Whether additional agricultural workers are ever needed will be "up to the 
(federal) Departments of Labor and Agriculture" to determine, Gustafson said. 
When such shortages occur, employers can draw on the extra worker pool allowed 
under the program that the INS explained Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there has been sharp disagreement over whether such shortages 
exists. In the past, agricultural interests and many farmers have argued that 
they require a steady supply of foreign workers to complete harvests. 
</P>
<P>
But immigrant advocates have disputed that contention, saying farmer interests 
merely want to flood the market with excess workers to obtain an economic 
advantage.

'CORSAIRE': TRIUMPH OF BALLETIC KITSCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music/Dance Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two great, rival ballet companies in the Soviet Union, and they are 
very different. Everybody knows that. 
</P>
<P>
The mighty Bolshoi of Moscow exults in flashy bravura, in high-class athletic 
indulgences, in generously gilded razzle and vulgar pyrotechnical dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
The mighty Kirov of Leningrad, on the other hand, is a historic bastion of 
taste and refinement, a proud stronghold of academic purity, a vaunted 
sanctuary of muted classicism. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
You have to forget it when the Kirov puts on "Le Corsaire." The visiting 
Soviets did just that Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and 
the result was a jolting revelation. 
</P>
<P>
This "Corsaire," the first full-length approximation of Marius Petipa's elusive 
romantic milestone to be seen in the United States, is, if nothing else, a 
bona-fide kitsch spectacular. It out-Bolshois the Bolshoi, and does so with 
irresistible cheer and infectious conviction. 
</P>
<P>
See the fragile ship tossed by ferocious waves, the picturesque passengers 
clinging to the boards for dear life. Pity their fate as the ill-fated vessel 
crashes upon a nasty rock. Listen to the thunder. Watch the lightning. 
</P>
<P>
You ain't seen nuffin yet. 
</P>
<P>
Ogle the pretty harem inmates in their spangled bras and bare midriffs, all 
dancing daintily and quaintly on their tippy-toes. Observe the sophisticated 
hootchy-kootch maneuvers. Laugh at the lecherous pasha, sneer at the greedy 
merchant, check out those riotous pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Wait. There's more. 
</P>
<P>
Sigh for the lovely, lovesick heroine who just happened to bring a spotless 
white tutu with her to the deserted island. Giggle at her adorably pert 
counterpart. Sigh, again, for a matched pair of heroes -- one a swashbuckling 
charmer, the other a noble savage. 
</P>
<P>
That's just the beginning, folks. 
</P>
<P>
Watch the assembled crew fly and soar and duel and spin and kiss and wiggle 
through multilayered, hopeless convolutions of intrigue, mystery and adventure. 
Enjoy the colorful diversions, share the excitement of the uplifting 
derring-do. 
</P>
<P>
All this just for the price of one admission. . . . 
</P>
<P>
While you're at it, savor the lavish, faintly stylized, quasi-Technicolored 
scenery. Admire the hysterical rainbow costumes. Gasp as you witness a 
veritable orgy of ever-moving scrims and veils and plumes and tassels and laser 
lights and genuine water fountains and drifting clouds and dancing flowers and 
countless other manifestations of postcard exotica. 
</P>
<P>
Ah. 
</P>
<P>
The Kirov "Corsaire" is thoroughly, unabashedly, whole-heartedly, shamelessly, 
passionately, unrepentantly tawdry. And it is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to love. All one has to do is refuse to take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers have to take it seriously, of course. That is the secret of their 
success. We don't. 
</P>
<P>
The production dates back, after a fashion, to 1856. Over the years, however, 
many hands have had their way with both the choreography and the score. 
</P>
<P>
What Oleg Vinogradov, current guardian of Kirov virtue, assembled in 1986 for 
this version is a sprawling pastiche -- a.k.a. mishmash or hodgepodge or jigsaw 
puzzle or free-for-all or patchwork. It acknowledges the confused contributions 
of four librettists (not including Lord Byron, who wrote the poem that inspired 
the subsequent variations) and six -- count 'em, six -- all-purpose composers: 
Adam, Pugni, Minkus, Delibes, Drigo and one Prince Oldenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Only two choreographers are credited: Petipa and Pyotr Gusev. However, informed 
sources also cite contributions of Joseph Mazilier (who preceded Petipa), Jules 
Perrot, Agrippina Vaganova, Yuri Slonimsky, Konstantin Sergeyev, Alexander 
Chekrygin, Vakhtang Chabukiani and Vinogradov himself. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the participation of so many cooks, this "Corsaire" represents a modest 
broth. The ballet is delightfully skimpy -- even with two intermissions, the 
final curtain falls at 10:30 -- and the action is brisk. 
</P>
<P>
The mime is minimal. What else is new? Expressive gesture has once again been 
allowed to supersede formal narrative communication. The dancing isn't exactly 
expansive, either. 
</P>
<P>
The set pieces familiar in the West are placed in unexpected contexts. The 
beloved pas de deux that Rudolf Nureyev brought with him from Leningrad turns 
out to be a pas de trois, the most flamboyant choreography assigned to the 
secondary cavalier. The "Pas d'esclave" serves as comic relief -- we used to 
think it was an amorous statement. The exquisite "Jardin anime" ensemble 
irrelevantly embellishes the harem scene, to tunes borrowed from "Sylvia." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of busywork surrounds these highlights. At least it is engaging busywork. 
And one striking discovery does emerge from the frantic excess: a delicate, 
mercurial trio in the last act for demi-soloists masquerading as Odalisques. 
</P>
<P>
The dancing, for the most part, re-affirmed the lofty Kirov tradition. Tatiana 
Terekhova was visually radiant, dramatically urgent and technically brilliant 
(those fouettes!) as the innocent yet rapturous Greek maiden, Medora. Tall and 
dashing, Evgeny Neff partnered her with deferential security as Conrad, the 
titular pirate. His thunder was stolen, however, by Farukh Ruzimatov as his 
long-limbed slave, Ali. 
</P>
<P>
The young firebrand from Tashkent brooded, smoldered and glowered, his bare 
chest thrust out, his chin held high, his dark locks streaming with studied 
nonchalance. He gobbled the air, writhed in superbly controlled ecstasy, flung 
himself to the floor magnificently in mock self-subjugation. It was a fabulous, 
narcissistic performance and, with push-button precision, it brought down the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Pankova glittered unevenly but always charmingly as Gulnara, the central 
soubrette. Vitali Tsvetkov rumbled fleetly as Lankedem, the slave-merchant (one 
saluted the removal of ancient anti-Semitic elements in the character). 
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Korneyev blustered nicely as the corsair lieutenant who didn't even 
flinch when his second musket refused to fire (the audience liked the 
unintended joke). Gennadi Borchenko bumbled benignly as the raunchy pasha. Best 
of all, perhaps, were the exquisitely stylish Odalisques of three junior 
ballerinas -- Veronica Ivanova, Zhanna Ayupova and Irina Chistiakova. 
</P>
<P>
Teimuraz Murvanidze's sets created a delirious, flexible never-neverland 
milieu. Galina Solovyova designed slinky Turkish bloomers and fluffy classical 
tutus with equal flair. 
</P>
<P>
In the pit, Victor Fedotov, a veteran of many Kirov wars, coaxed remarkable 
verve and precision from the Pacific Symphony, 
</P>
<P>
It was a splendid camping trip.

KFAC PARCELS OUT CLASSICAL LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG and TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When KFAC -- Los Angeles' first and only commercial classical radio station -- 
abandons its venerable format next month, its substantial collection of 
recordings will be parceled out to Stanford University, the Los Angeles Public 
Library, and to public radio station KUSC, station officials have disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The donation of the library serves as a virtual nail in the coffin for the 
classical station, assuring that KFAC (FM 92.3) will not remain classical as 
was promised when the station was bought by Evergreen Media Corp. in January 
for $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
After reports that he was trying to sell the library and call letters for $1 
million, KFAC president and general manager Jim de Castro said Tuesday that in 
late September he plans to donate the record portion of the station's library 
-- estimated at 50,000 recordings -- to Stanford University and the station's 
collection of 5,000 compact discs to the Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come to terms and we're delighted with opportunity of donating our 
library as opposed to selling our library," De Castro said. "The reason we're 
donating it is so the Los Angeles public will have the opportunity to . . . 
check it out at the public library at no cost." 
</P>
<P>
Said City Librarian Wyman Jones of the donation: "We are very pleased to 
receive this remarkable gift. It will be housed in our Central Library in 
downtown Los Angeles where it will be available for loan to the public." 
</P>
<P>
William Moran, honorary curator of Stanford University's Archive of Recorded 
Music, said:"I think it's absolutely tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
De Castro said he also plans to donate "some of the rarest and most unusual 
discs that they don't already have" to public radio station KUSC-FM. He said he 
wants the donated records to be introduced as having been "brought to you by 
(KFAC owners) Evergreen Media Corp., who now programs FM-92." FM-92 is what the 
station is now calling itself, in preparation for its switch to a pop music 
format. 
</P>
<P>
He will also turn over the station's call letters to one of the three stations 
licensed to USC. KUSC's programming is currently simulcast on two other public 
stations (KSCA in Santa Barbara and KCPB in Ventura County). A fourth USC-owned 
station to serve the Palm Springs area is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
KUSC General Manager Wally Smith said that KUSC's call letters will remain the 
same, but that one of the satellite stations will pick up KFAC's identifying 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
A press conference on this subject is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a very fragile and delicate thing to change the format because 
of the passion with which people regard the format," De Castro said. "Economics 
have dictated that this change is necessary to make. . . . The minute we do 
switch over to a new format, while it will offend the classical listeners that 
are here, the minute we switch we will be delivering five times the audience at 
least and delivering much more of the type of sound that L.A. is requesting." 
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1938, KFAC has been steadily acquiring recordings 
that have made it the nation's third-largest classical radio station library. 
Occupying a cramped area in the station's headquarters in Hollywood, the 
tightly stacked recordings are arranged by record label, with separate sections 
for opera, film scores and musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the strength of the library is how much non-great music there is by 
non-great artists," says announcer John Santana. 
</P>
<P>
Almost any music library, for instance, will house Beethoven's Violin Concerto, 
but it isn't easy to find a recording of symphonies by Bohemian composer Georg 
Anton Benda, half a dozen different performances of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The 
Gondoliers" or a recording of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor performed by 
the Yale Accordion Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The option of donating the library loomed larger as KFAC was unable to sell its 
collection. When KKGO president Saul Levine announced his intent to change the 
format of his jazz station to predominantly classical last month, many 
observers believed that KKGO would purchase KFAC's largely classical library. 
But Levine said he was not willing to pay the $1-million asking price. 
</P>
<P>
De Castro said he was never seeking such a high figure, though he did say that 
two appraisers valued the collection at upwards of $1.8 million. He suggested 
that a station might be willing to pay about $2 apiece for the LPs, and 
considerably more for the CDs, and estimated the library's market value to be 
somewhere between $125,000 and $500,000, if sold as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the collection could be sold at all was open to question. Almost 
all of the recordings in the studio's library were given to KFAC free for 
promotional purposes by the record companies. A spokesman for CBS records said 
that if KFAC were to sell the records, "they would be violating the conditions 
under which the records were given to them." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the collection were to be donated, recording distributors have voiced 
objections. Jerry Stein of Los Angeles-based Delta Music, noted, "KUSC already 
has every CD we have released," and he fears that the discs may well end up in 
used-record stores. "We want (KFAC) to turn them over to KKGO," he said, "or 
give them back to us." 
</P>
<P>
One resource that has apparently disappeared from the library is the 
potentially vast collection of taped interviews and special programs produced 
by KFAC. Current staff members cannot account for the materials. 
</P>
<P>
Former announcer and host of "Luncheon at the Music Center" Thomas Cassidy said 
that he believes that most of the tapes of his noontime interviews were erased, 
but that he has copies of most of the old Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl 
programs. Tom Dixon, who like Cassidy, worked for more than 40 years at KFAC 
and interviewed such artists as Carlo Maria Giulini and Beverly Sills, laments 
that he kept "precious few. . . . I could kick myself." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Princi, the station's program director until 1985, still has "probably a 
couple hundred tapes," but he said that these are copies, not the original 
tapes. "I would assume that the originals are non-existent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The meat of collection, however, are the classical LPs and CDs. "Whether it's 
worth any money or not really is beside the point," says Bob Wennersten, KFAC's 
program director. "It is the depth of this collection that is its real value."

On public-television stations around the country tonight, would-be astronomers 
and insomniacs alike can spend the wee hours looking at close-up photographs of 
Neptune's recent past as Voyager 2 zips past the planet and its moons at 38,000 
m.p.h., snapping pictures like a shutter-happy tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the speed of light, the signals that make up those photographs 
will take four hours and six minutes to traverse the 2.7 billion miles 
separating Neptune and Earth. And just as soon as the signals are received by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deep space tracking 
antennas in California, Spain and Australia and then turned into photographs by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, viewers will be able 
to see them on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic slide show begins at 11:30 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, at 11 p.m. on 
KVCR Channel 24 and at 12:25 a.m. on KPBS Channel 15, and will continue until 
at least 4 a.m. Friday. Anyone willing to stay up will get the first look at 
these pictures from deep space just hours after the 1-ton Voyager spacecraft 
makes its closest pass over the clouds of Neptune, turns 45 degrees with the 
help of the planet's gravity and then flies past Neptune's quirky moon, Triton. 
Voyager is scheduled to buzz within 3,000 miles of Neptune's wispy cloud tops 
tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on Voyager's close encounter with Neptune, the pale-blue eighth planet 
from the sun that was discovered in 1846, will also be carried throughout the 
night on Cable News Network and C-SPAN. CNN will have extended live coverage of 
the mission beginning at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
During its 4.4-billion mile, circuitous journey through the solar system, 
Voyager 2 has already photographed Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Tonight's 
meeting with Neptune, which is four times the size of Earth, will be Voyager's 
final visit to a planetary system before it darts off into the infinity of 
space. Scientists hope that Voyager will provide the first direct measurements 
of the environment outside the solar system sometime in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' "Neptune All Night" will feature 20-minute updates each hour from NASA and 
JPL scientists as they examine and interpret the most recent photographs. The 
remaining 40 minutes each hour will originate live from WHYY-TV in Philadelphia 
and will include a panel of experts on the East Coast and at JPL analyzing the 
new data, live viewer calls on a nationwide toll-free hot line, reaction to the 
Neptune voyage from science-fiction writers and celebrities, a recap of 
Voyager's previous planetary encounters and a frivolous look at space travel in 
movies and science-fiction literature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are staying on the air all night to present this program because there 
really has been a rebirth in public interest in the space program," said Don 
Leifer, program director at KVCR in San Bernardino. "We literally had a block 
party on my street with all the people watching the lunar eclipse (last week). 
This show is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. It's the first time anyone 
will have seen such close-up pictures of Neptune, and we felt this falls 
exactly into where public television should go." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Edward Stone, Voyager's chief project scientist, called the 
meeting with Neptune "the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer 
planets, and like a symphony, its tempo is accelerating as it nears the end." 
</P>
<P>
Already Voyager has discovered four previously unknown Neptunian moons, a 
complete ring and several partial rings circling the planet, a huge storm 
system the size of the Earth that may pack winds up to 400 m.p.h. and a strong 
magnetic field. JPL scientists expect further discoveries today as the 
spacecraft sails through the upper reaches of Neptune's atmosphere and then 
within 2,500 miles of Triton, the moon that revolves the "wrong" way and 
appears to have a transparent atmosphere and a pinkish, iced surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It may snow from time to time in places, there may be heavy frost laid down," 
astronomer Bradford Smith said of the eccentric satellite. "What we would 
really like to do is to get some idea of what Triton's geological history has 
been. It's a strange satellite, it's in the wrong orbit, it's going backward 
around Neptune, and something truly catastrophic must have happened at some 
time in its past." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's snapshots of Neptune can also be seen on the NASA-Select satellite 
feed by anyone with their own satellite dish, on some cable-access channels and 
at various locations around the Southland. The NASA-Select feed will contain 
fresh images from space as well as NASA and JPL press conferences and 
discussions of the mission and the spacecraft's discoveries. The NASA feed will 
begin at 9 a.m. today and continue through the night, and also will be 
broadcast from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NASA-Select feed can be seen at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, the Griffith Park Observatory, Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in San 
Diego, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Cal State Long Beach, El 
Camino College, San Diego State, Santa Monica College, UCLA, USC, Ambassador 
College, Southwestern College and on some cable systems. Interested viewers 
should call their cable operators for details. 
</P>
<P>
The Learning Channel will also offer a one-hour progress report on Voyager 
today at 5 p.m. CNN will air a special report, "Voyager: Rendezvous With 
Neptune," Saturday at 5 a.m. And TBS will carry its own special on Voyager at 7 
p.m. Sunday, hosted by Carl Sagan and Sidney Poitier.

STAGE WATCH: 23-YEAR EQUITY CHIEF CONFIRMS RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rumors had been going around for months, but Edward Weston, Western Regional 
director of Actors' Equity, has now officially confirmed that he will retire 
from his post at the actors' union on Sept. 1, 1990 -- one week after his 65th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to deny it," said Weston, who played a controversial and 
contradictory role in what became known last year as the "Equity Waiver Wars." 
</P>
<P>
Weston, who was the chief designer of the 1972 Equity Waiver Plan (whereby the 
union waived certain rules, though not its jurisdiction, in theaters of fewer 
than 100 seats, thus freeing actors to perform and to produce themselves in 
small venues) became one of the plan's chief opponents 16 years later, after he 
became convinced that it was being abused. 
</P>
<P>
A modification of the Waiver, proposed by the union's Western Advisory Board 
and voted in by the Los Angeles membership, resulted last year in a lengthy and 
bitter dispute between Equity and local small theater operators (many of whom 
were also Equity members) who wanted the vote rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of improprieties, predictions of doom and gloom, and a lawsuit 
eventually resulted in a mutually acceptable modified plan. But Weston took a 
lot of personal abuse from unhappy Waiverites during the year-long struggle. He 
acknowledged Wednesday that the badgering had influenced a decision he had 
begun to make a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
"W. C. Fields said, 'It was a woman who drove me to drink and I never wrote to 
thank her.' If the Waiver people did hasten my decision," Weston said, "I'd 
like to thank them now. 
</P>
<P>
"We had predicted there would be no problem (implementing the new plan) and 
there isn't," he continued. "I wish it could all be put into proper 
perspective. It's the least thing we do in the (Western) office, but the 
enormous emphasis on the Waiver has been disruptive and has distorted 
everything else we do. We cover 14 Western states." 
</P>
<P>
Weston who is 64 today has held his current post for 23 years. Asked if he had 
any interest in using his final year in office to try to enlist the 
entertainment industry in helping to fund live theater, Weston said: "We're 
still trying to get the film and television industries to contribute money to 
our people with AIDS. They refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem. Why 
would we get them to acknowledge anything else?" 
</P>
<P>
On a personal level, Weston hopes to lead a less structured life after 
retirement, he said. "I hope to travel at a more leisurely pace; I love to read 
books that have nothing to do with theater; I might even go back to school to 
learn French and history; I hope to continue teaching (he teaches a graduate 
class in arts administration at UCLA). It's stimulating and rewarding to work 
with bright young minds. It gives me a great deal of hope. It's also nice to be 
Professor Weston," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
And he mentioned the de rigueur item for any self-respecting Hollywood 
resident: "I have an idea I'd like to peddle to a movie producer. As it is now, 
I don't have the time. You know the lyrics from 'On the Town,' " said this 
former Broadway hoofer. " 'Where has all the time gone?/ Haven't done half the 
things I want to do' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mind you, I still love Equity," he said. "It's been my life for almost 40 
years -- 40 next year. There's been no fight. No explosion. Just a decision to 
make a change. I still think Equity is an organization that's underestimated by 
its membership. Theater is a cottage industry and Equity a cottage union, but I 
like it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't want to deal with any more is hostility, especially the kind that 
was so prevalent in L.A. during the last few years. I got tired of dealing with 
people with little minds and big mouths. I'm not going to identify who these 
people are, but if the mouth fits. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Asked who his successor might be, Weston said that the decision would be up to 
the union's governing council in New York, adding, "Certainly I think that 
George Ives (the Western office's senior business representative) is uniquely 
qualified for the job." 
</P>
<P>
(Alan Eisenberg, Equity's executive secretary stated Wednesday that he hopes to 
announce a replacement by the end of the year.) 
</P>
<P>
SPACE ANYONE?: The Mark Taper Forum's search for a third theater continues. 
"We've been looking diligently for a space that would accommodate a 250- to 
300-seat theater -- ideally flexible staging," said artistic director Gordon 
Davidson. "Existing spaces are not really right. I'd like to find a raw space 
-- an empty supermarket, a garage or a warehouse. It's costly to convert, but I 
believe we'll come up with something some day." 
</P>
<P>
The new space eventually would house the activities of Taper, Too and the 
Taper's Improvisational Theatre Project (its children's theater arm). The 
current Taper, Too space, Davidson said, would revert to being the Taper Lab, 
one of its earlier incarnations.

TEACHERS TO WEIGH 6.5% SALARY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers will get a 6.5% salary increase for the coming school year and have 
more say on faculty advisory councils at their schools under a tentative 
agreement reached last week with the Santa Monica-Malibu School District. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement for a two-year contract also boosts the minimum and maximum 
salaries for teachers and increases the pay for substitutes and for service 
outside of regular classroom hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a fair proposal," said June Lucas, president of the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Classroom Teachers Assn. "We hope the teachers will ratify it." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would raise the average teacher salary from $38,950 to $41,481. 
The minimum pay for all unit members will be $27,000; currently a starting 
teacher's salary is $22,470. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1990, teachers with 28 years experience in the district who have 
taken professional advancement courses will earn $50,752. The current top 
salary -- $46,427 -- is for 25 years experience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Sept. 18 
</P>
<P>
The district's 500 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians will vote on the 
agreement the week of Sept. 18, Lucas said. The district board will then vote 
on the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who left stamped, self-addressed envelopes at district offices were 
sent details of the agreement Friday. By the end of the month, all employees 
will be mailed the superintendent's report and a welcome-back-to-school 
message, which will include a summary of the terms. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Eugene Tucker said that with the salary increases, the district hopes to 
better compete with the Los Angeles Unified School District, which, under its 
contract ratified in May, offers a starting pay of $27,346 for the 1989-90 
school year. Recently, two or three teachers chose Los Angeles over Santa 
Monica, citing better pay as the reason, Tucker said. But he said he did not 
know of any Santa Monica teachers who have left the district to work for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the increases in (LAUSD), and (because) they're giving a $5,000 
bonus for bilingual teachers, that's pretty much dried up the market," Tucker 
said. Santa Monica needs three or four bilingual teachers but does not offer 
them bonuses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas said the agreement, reached after five months of negotiation with 
district officials and board members, reflected that the union did "the best as 
we can for the unit members." Los Angeles teachers negotiated 8% increases a 
year for the next two years, and "one always looks at what neighboring 
districts are getting," she said, but "that we have to get 8% or go on strike . 
. . was not one of our contemplations." 
</P>
<P>
"We set our goals commensurate with our resources," she said. "L.A. is a 
different situation both in terms of size and money. We are not driven by L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement the district will continue to pay for health and dental 
benefits, which have increased in cost by about $500 to $3,550 for the 1989-90 
year. Details of salary increases and benefits for 1990-91 will be negotiated 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who supervise Saturday student disciplinary classes will be paid 
$27.50 an hour, up from $23.10. Teachers will have more professional courses 
available after school and on weekends and will be paid for attending some of 
them, Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, substitutes will earn from $80 to $125 per day, 
up from $70 to $100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will also have more powers. Faculty advisory councils at the schools, 
which make recommendations on curricula and scheduling, will gain the right to 
advise the district on school budget issues. The councils might also advise 
principals on whether aides should be used for yard duty or other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The councils, Tucker said, "have dealt with complaints and concerns, but we'd 
like them to move to a more proactive level . . . to offer guidance to the 
principals on more substantive decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Lucas said Santa Monica teachers have had more participation in 
decision-making than their Los Angeles counterparts. Besides the advisory 
councils, teachers sit on an education committee that advises the board and on 
curricula committees at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas said that teachers who were surveyed before negotiations began were most 
concerned about salary and benefits and did not identify teacher power as a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for a committee of teachers and administrators to 
consider increasing elementary school teachers' preparation time. Currently, 
they are allotted 20 paid minutes a day to call parents and prepare lesson 
plans. The union wants that increased by a half-hour, Lucas said. Middle- and 
high-school teachers get about 50 minutes a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement will not require any cuts in the district's propsed 
$45-million budget, the district will be unable to pay for major program 
improvements, Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
COMPARISON OF AGREEMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Here are the terms of the tentative agreement on a two-year contract between 
the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and the Santa Monica-Malibu 
Classroom Teachers Assn., and a comparison with the settlement reached earlier 
this year with teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
SALARIES 
</P>
<P>
A 6.5% increase for the 1989-90 school year, with the 1990-91 adjustment to be 
negotiated next year. The minimum salary for teachers, nurses, counselors and 
librarians is to be $27,000. Here is how the two districts compare for the 
coming year:

ROSE BOWL RESTROOM ADS OKD

<P>
It wasn't exactly sacrosanct, but it used to be one place you could go to 
escape the barrage of Madison Avenue hype. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. At least not in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors on Tuesday approved the placement of 
advertising boards in the Rose Bowl's 27 permanent restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Each board will contain 12, 28-inch-tall ad panels, hung above the urinals in 
the men's restrooms and inside the entrances to the women's restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$99,000 Return Possible 
</P>
<P>
Indoor Media Concepts, a Tustin company that "specializes in unique marketing 
concepts," according to a city staff report, approached the Rose Bowl staff 
with the new idea. Only two other companies nationwide provide a similar 
service, but neither of them are in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Potential advertisers include radio stations, software developers, automobile 
makers and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The city's return could reach $99,000 -- 60% of the restroom ad income. In 
addition, the city will be allocated one public service ad on each board. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if anybody had told me this is the way you make money, I'd have told 
them they were crazy," said City Manager Don McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Reservations 
</P>
<P>
The ads could replace revenue lost from the cancellation of a September concert 
and could enable the city to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages at the 
stadium, a move that may be considered by the Board of Directors in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the board members considered the restroom ads a discreet way 
to earn more money for the bowl, Director Rick Cole had reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already decorated one side of the Rose Bowl with 'Chrysler Car of 
Champions' and it seems more and more athletes themselves are becoming walking 
billboards," he said. "Should we have behind the mayor, 'This City Council 
meeting is brought to you by the Norton Simon Museum?' "

The Gabrielino Indian confronted the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the Gabrielino Indians. This is our territory, in our hearts and 
minds," Vera Rocha told Tim Cantwell earlier this month when she and a 
half-dozen other activists staged a surprise visit to the magnificent 220-acre 
chunk of the San Gabriel Mountain foothills that Cantwell wants to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell, 36, looked somewhat puzzled as Rocha spoke. She told him how three 
weeks earlier John Hafner, an Occidental College biology professor who lives on 
property next to Cantwell's, had discovered an ancient Indian grinding stone 
while digging an irrigation line. 
</P>
<P>
That's interesting, Cantwell told her. But he said a survey by an expert he 
hired last year concluded that there was nothing archeologically significant 
about the land where the two were standing. In the past three years Cantwell 
and his partners have spent $10 million in acquiring and planning a residential 
community for the property. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not be significant to you. But it is to us," said Rocha, 60, who 
lives in Baldwin Park and had come that day at the request of Altadena 
residents worried about the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
As Rocha continued, she invoked her ancestors, Mother Earth and the sanctity of 
the land, which for most of this century was home to a tuberculosis sanatorium 
known as La Vina and named for the vineyards once there. 
</P>
<P>
These close encounters of an uncomfortable kind have been occurring for more 
than two years as developers and neighbors try to reconcile their differences. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14 the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a 
hearing on whether to grant zone changes that would allow residential housing. 
The proposal calls for 270 single-family homes nestled around indigenous live 
oaks and the deep canyons of the surrounding Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, by a 4-1 vote, the county's regional Planning Commission approved 
the zoning changes required for the developers' plan, which now represents a 
scaled-down version of what was once a 360-unit project. But the planners 
rejected the idea of permitting a LaCanada Flintridge private school to 
relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what effect the discovery of the grinding stone, known as a 
"metate," may have on next month's proceedings, according to Darene 
Southerland, a county regional planning assistant handling the case. The Board 
of Supervisors, she said, will consider whatever evidence may be presented 
about the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the grinding stone further complicates a project, which has 
involved Altadena planners, local town council members, the Urban League of 
Pasadena, Pasadena City College, the county's parks and recreation department, 
the county's flood control experts and thousands of Altadena's 43,000 
residents, who have been wooed to support one point of view or the other. 
</P>
<P>
And matters could become even more complicated. Earlier this month opponents of 
the project, Friends of La Vina, received a boost when a New York City-based 
law firm, Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn, decided to take up the cause 
pro bono. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure the county Board of Supervisors proceeds with caution and 
care so as not to destroy the natural resources and natural beauty in Los 
Angeles County," said Deborah Bucksbaum of the firm's Century City office. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Cantwell, president of Cantwell/Anderson Inc., which in 1987 was 
joined by Orange County's Southwest Diversified Inc. in the project, said his 
goal is to balance environmental concerns with the desire to develop a prime 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell uses phrases like "positive synergistic spillover" when talking about 
the project. He has proposed donating $200,000 in improvements to nearby Loma 
Alta Park and upgrading equestrian trails in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely high-quality site, and it has the propensity to be a 
wonderful environment for people to live," Cantwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the $100 million project will be "a tremendous shot in the arm to 
West Altadena" which he said had suffered economically for decades. The 
California Craftsman-style homes will sell for between $300,000 and $450,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
And Cantwell, in cooperation with area minority leaders, has worked out a jobs 
training and employment program to assist local minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half for Forest 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell said he will protect the rugged terrain of the half-dozen canyons, 
barely a 10-minute drive from downtown Pasadena. Half of the 220 acres, he 
said, will be dedicated to the national forest. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, he said, would like to see the entire property left alone. But 
Cantwell said, "That's not going to happen. This is going to be developed. 
Period. The only question is how. We believe residential development is the 
answer for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Cantwell said his company wanted to be sensitive toward Native 
Americans. "The discovery (of the grinding stone) certainly drives us to be 
more cautious." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, when Cantwell received the unexpected visitors, he let the group 
roam among the graded, dusty land to see if they could find other evidence of a 
Native American settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In the search party were Chester King, a Topanga Canyon archeologist, who once 
grabbed onto the blade of an earthmover to protect an Indian site in Topanga; 
Vera Rocha and her husband Manuel Rocha, both deeply involved in attempts to 
stop large-scale developments where they believe artifacts might be unearthed 
and desecrated; a handful of neighborhood residents, including Hafner and his 
wife, Patti, who together discovered the portable grinding stone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we're against development per se," said 37-year-old Patti 
Hafner, a Pasadena schoolteacher. "It's just the density is too high. There 
will be too many homes. There's not much of the San Gabriels left and it would 
be nice to keep what's left." 
</P>
<P>
As they traversed the rocky earth, they searched for clues. Here and there they 
found the feather of a raven, one of a red-tailed hawk and the tuft of an owl. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, King bent down to find what appeared to be a scraping tool that, 
he said, might be 2,000 years old. "If I saw five more rocks like that, I'd say 
there might have been a settlement here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Site Archeologist 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell assured him he would hire an archeologist to be present during the 
construction phase to preserve any significant findings. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to give Vera Rocha little solace. 
</P>
<P>
As a gentle wind stirred through the canyons where she said her ancestors once 
roamed, she could see for miles around, even with the tinge of smog masking the 
view. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very beautiful here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Cantwell said, in a moment when opposing points of view converged. "It 
is gorgeous."

ORDINANCE EVICTS 75 FROM RUN-DOWN MOTEL IN SAN GABRIEL 
</P>

<P>
Some cried when they were told to leave. Others became angry. Three-year-old 
Jeremy Ginsvach got scared. He grabbed his favorite kitten and stuffed it in a 
suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen destitute families, many with small children and infants, were 
evicted this week from a dilapidated San Gabriel motel because of a city 
ordinance that forbids stays in a motel of more than 21 days over a three-month 
period. 
</P>
<P>
In what looked like a succession of modern-day wagon trains, about 75 guests at 
the Valley Motel packed up their tattered lives in station wagons and pickup 
trucks and headed down Valley Boulevard in search of another place to live. The 
motel, facing a series of health and safety violations, was closed after the 
last family left. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the families had lived at the motel for more than six months, unable to 
leave because they could not afford the deposit to rent an apartment or house. 
Most of the families depend on welfare checks, Social Security and sporadic 
employment to pay their bills -- as high as $250 a week at the motel -- which 
rarely left anything for savings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Lows in Last Week 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy, his three sisters, mother and grandmother had lived in Room 17 at the 
back of the motel since June, spending all but $500 of their monthly income on 
lodging. Jeremy's life at the 35-room motel with its murky green swimming pool 
and run-down guest rooms had had its ups and downs. But the last week brought 
new lows. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, Jeremy and his sisters ate a paste of flour and water for dinner 
because there was no money to buy food. Last Friday, his grandmother was told 
to move the family by Monday, but she had no idea where to go or how to get 
there since her car had been stolen from the motel carport. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the family pulled together its belongings, Jeremy's mother, Michelle, 
came upon an awful discovery. Jeremy's favorite kitten, the one with the white 
and gray patches that the little boy had hidden in the suitcase for 
safekeeping, had smothered to death. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at it this way," said Jeremy's 71-year-old grandmother, Nell 
Snyder, who was forced from her rented Bell Gardens home in March when the 
owner sold it, "Today may be bad, but tomorrow may be worse. It isn't easy, but 
you have to take what life dishes out." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and a dozen or so other guests said they had never been warned about the 
San Gabriel law limiting stays to 21 days. Valley Motel Manager Ken Tang said 
he rented rooms well past the 21 days because the city never enforced the law. 
Last week, he posted a photocopy of the statute on the motel's office window 
for the first time after being contacted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel city officials said they pressured the motel's owners last week 
about the long-term guests because of problems there, including alleged drug 
dealing, prostitution, robberies and child neglect. Officials said there is not 
a citywide crackdown on the residency ordinance. But police said problems at 
the Valley Motel were far worse than at any other motel in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. David Lawton said that since the first of the year there have been 
seven robberies, six stolen cars, 10 assaults and about 15 narcotics-related 
arrests at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an inspection of the motel last Thursday uncovered dozens of fire, 
building and health code violations, City Administrator Robert Clute said, 
ranging from an unsanitary swimming pool to heaters with gas leaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is terrible," said San Gabriel Police Lt. James Gardner, who helped several 
elderly guests find other places to stay. "It is like holding somebody up 
without a gun." 
</P>
<P>
The motel, The Times learned, has been operating without a business license 
since January, apparently with full knowledge of some city officials. Tang 
applied for a change of business ownership in January when he took over as 
motel manager, but the license was never issued because an inspection by the 
city's planning, building and fire departments revealed numerous code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Estrada, the city's code enforcement officer, said the motel was given 
until May 4 to correct the violations, which included such things as faulty 
wiring and non-removable iron bars over windows. Estrada said the city extended 
the deadline until mid-June, but never went back to inspect the motel until 
last week when the Police Department complained about conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
"It is due to the amount of work we have here and the lack of staff," said 
Estrada. "That is what it comes down to. We have a lot of files that haven't 
been looked at in months. That is just the lack of staff. You can quote me all 
the way to China, I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
City officials identified the owner of the motel as a partnership including 
Eddy Liu, a developer who has proposed tearing down the complex of stucco 
buildings and replacing it with a luxury hotel. Liu would need special approval 
from the city's Planning Commission and City Council to build the hotel because 
of a construction moratorium in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
A man at the motel on Monday, who would identify himself only as a co-owner of 
the property, confirmed that the partnership has considered tearing down the 
motel. The man said the owners, Stel Associates Inc. of Alhambra, were also 
considering renovating the complex. But he said the owners had no plans to 
immediately evict the guests. 
</P>
<P>
"The police are the ones who drove these people out, not us," the man said. "We 
don't want this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The man referred other questions about the motel to Patrick Huang, an attorney 
for the owners, who was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Moving has become a way of life for many of the families forced to leave the 
Valley Motel, but that didn't make it any easier for them on Monday. There were 
sad tales in every corner of the beige and brown motel, whose marquee beckons 
passing motorists with the poetic promise: "Stay here tonite. The Price is 
Right." 
</P>
<P>
For some, the eviction aroused old feelings of resentment toward a society that 
they feel has abandoned them. Many directed their anger at Tang, who moved to 
the area from China two years ago. They said Tang shouldn't have rented out 
rooms to long-term guests if he knew about the 21-day law. 
</P>
<P>
Abel Moya, a 45-year-old Vietnam veteran, drowned his sorrows with a few 
friends and a case of beer on the porch outside Room 7. He said Tang owed him 
several hundred dollars for rent paid in advance. Without the money, Moya said, 
he had no where to go with his wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
Several rooms away, two teen-age boys fired a BB gun at a window. Around the 
corner, another boy set a large stuffed animal on fire. At a nearby pay phone, 
Susie Rivera, mother of six, desperately tried to find a lawyer to help them. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is more time," said Rivera, who paid $1,000 a month for Room 23, 
which reeked of mildew because its carpet had been drenched by a leaking 
faucet. "How can they expect us to find a place with such short notice?" 
</P>
<P>
John E. Rittmayer, an attorney with the nonprofit Legal Services Program in 
Pasadena, wrote a letter on behalf of the guests demanding advance notice of at 
least one week before the eviction, but it did little good. The guests complied 
with the eviction notice, even though some said they would sue later. 
</P>
<P>
At the advice of a security guard hired by the owners, Tang locked himself in 
the motel's office as the guard, Michael Gauvin, urged the guests to pack their 
things on Monday. By mid-afternoon, water, gas and electricity had been shut 
off. Families used pool water to flush their toilets. 
</P>
<P>
By early evening, nearly all of the families had moved on. Some went to stay 
with relatives, while others found another motel. Some just drove away, not 
knowing where they would spend the night. Four families showed up at nearby St. 
Anthony's Roman Catholic Church, where Father Patrick Thompson took $275 from 
the parish's poor fund to put them up for two nights in a neighboring motel. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday afternoon, police said, all but a few stragglers had left the motel 
and by Wednesday, they said, the owners had blocked the front entrance with a 
security fence. Even the cats were gone, taken by Gauvin to an animal shelter.

Photo, Getting the Gain Without the Pain -- Sometimes it seems that everyone in 
the country is on a fitness binge. Parents and their 2- to 6-year-old children 
can even work out together in aerobic play classes at Live Oak Park offered by 
the Temple City Recreation Department. There are always some people who have a 
hard time getting started, so Brooke Graves, 2 1/2, gives her mother, Darla 
Davis, the push she needs. The class isn't all moving and sweating, though -- 
Dusty Wilf, 5, sits on her mother Lisa's lap during a story told by aerobics 
instructor Vikki Shore. The course is open to dads, but most of the parents 
present are of the mom variety. For some members of the class, all those moves 
are just too hard to figure out. This class has just ended, but a new class 
will begin Sept. 25. IRFAN KHAN / Los Angeles Times

PARK PROJECTS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are helping residents in an effort to reclaim Philadelphia Park. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the City Council approved the installation of new playground 
equipment and construction of a concrete sidewalk and curbing. The action is 
expected to discourage gang activity and drug dealing at the park, adjacent to 
Philadelphia Elementary School on Philadelphia Street near Towne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision to spend about $53,000 to fix up the park followed 
meetings with a neighborhood organization, the Philadelphia Community Outreach 
Group, which was concerned about loud noises, broken beer bottles and recurring 
graffiti, said Doug Bridges, Pomona's director of parks and recreation. In the 
past, residents who attempted to remove graffiti have been threatened by gang 
members, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
Beautifying the park "is a concerted effort of citizens saying, 'we've had 
enough,' and the city seeing what it can do," Bridges said. "Hopefully, with 
the new facilities we can turn the situation around." 
</P>
<P>
The city also will sponsor recreational activities, including soccer games and 
arts and crafts sales, in the hopes of discouraging trouble makers at the park, 
he said. Similar programs are being considered at Kellogg Park and Lincoln 
Park. Bridges said new play equipment installed last year has brought more 
families to Kennedy Park near Ganesha High School.

FIRE DAMAGES ART CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westside Art Center, a private nonprofit facility that provides classes in 
the arts for children, was hit by an arson fire over the weekend. One bungalow 
was gutted by the blaze and another was severely damaged by smoke and water. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department arson investigator Lyle Lentz said the fire was reported about 
3 a.m. Saturday and was believed to have been deliberately set from the 
outside. He estimated damage at $50,000 to the building and $25,000 to the 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyn Clark, executive director of the center, said video and stereo 
equipment, musical instruments, art supplies and the children's artwork were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
She said classes will meet outdoors for the next two weeks to complete the 
summer session. However, she said she does not yet know where classes will be 
held for the fall session, which begins in late September. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which was formed in 1981 and serves about 300 children weekly, 
rents the bungalows on the McKinley School grounds from the Santa Monica-Malibu 
Unified School District. District officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The children's reaction has been mixed," Clark said. "They have been terrific 
in terms of pitching in and cleaning up. They are feeling sad, but they also 
have a sense of real ownership and want to make it back the way it use to be."

WATER-PLAN PENALTY DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a concession to landlords irked by a pilot water-conservation project, the 
city of Santa Monica has delayed implementing a penalty clause in a toilet and 
shower head replacement program that is designed to cut city waste water by 
about 8% by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 6 to 0, the City Council approved the plan proposed Aug. 1 to install 
ultra-low-flow fixtures on as many as one-fourth of residential bathrooms in 
Santa Monica. The measure, hailed by the city as an innovative conservation 
step, includes free distribution of 1,000 toilets and shower heads to property 
owners and a $100 rebate for each retrofitted bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners succeeded, however, in postponing a planned $1-a-month 
surcharge on water bills, scheduled to go into effect April 1 next year, for 
those not complying with the program. The landlords objected to the council 
that costs of replacing toilets and remodeling surrounding floor and wall areas 
exceeded city estimates, and that some costs should be passed on to tenants, 
who are responsible for using the water-saving devices. 
</P>
<P>
The city agreed to review its replacement cost estimates and consider requiring 
tenants to pay part of them before the measure goes into effect next spring.

PIPELINE AGREEMENT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council has approved a new $12,000-a-year, 20-year 
franchise agreement for Shell California Pipeline Co. for a 3.9-mile 
underground crude oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the oil company to increase its liability 
insurance on the pipeline from $5 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline runs in a north-south direction essentially along 26th Street and 
Colverfield Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The new franchise comes a month after Shell agreed to pay the city $2.1 million 
to settle an eight-year legal dispute over franchise fees. In 1981, after 
Shell's 40-year lease expired, the city raised the annual franchise fee to 
$237,000, based on the market value of the land above the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The oil company sued, but a federal judge ruled that the fee was legitimate. 
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision, and the U.S. Supreme 
Court refused to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
Shell then filed suit to obtain an easement on the land and sought a trial to 
establish the value of the land. The city countersued for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's $2.1-million settlement resulted in all lawsuits between Shell and 
the city being dropped.

COVINA POLICE UNION NOT SATISFIED WITH CHIEF'S CONCESSIONS

<P>
While a recent report by Police Chief John Lentz addressed some of their 
concerns, members of the police union say promised changes aren't enough to 
improve departmental morale. 
</P>
<P>
In a 28-page report released last week, Lentz agreed to make some of the 
changes the Police Assn. of Covina had requested in the department's promotion, 
training and assignment policies. 
</P>
<P>
But the chief hasn't allayed the union's concerns on standardizing assignment 
procedures and increasing staffing, said Officer Vic Lupu, president of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-member union, which complained that staff morale has plummeted during 
the five years Lentz has been chief, asked the City Council in early July to 
intervene. Lentz and City Manager John Thomson met with the council in closed 
session Aug. 7 to present the report responding to union concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Ask for Input 
</P>
<P>
In his point-by-point response, Lentz agreed to review the department's 
training needs and to standardize procedures for making special assignments. He 
also said that he would ask for input from sergeants when evaluating officers 
for promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"On the face of it, it looks like there's an attempt to work on some problem 
areas," Lupu said. But he said the chief's promise to standardize procedures 
for making assignments isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worry is he makes the qualifications fit the person he wants," Lupu said. 
He said the union wants all special assignment listings to be posted. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz declined to follow other union recommendations, such as designating the 
number and types of beats assigned for each of the day's three watches. 
</P>
<P>
Describing staff scheduling as a "management prerogative" under an agreement 
with the union, Lentz retained overlapping shifts, which the union said may 
reduce safety for patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the chief's report focused on conditions the union said 
contributed to low morale. Responding to criticism that "participative 
management is almost non-existent," Lentz said he has reinstituted monthly 
staff meetings that include participation by sergeants, who are union members. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz said he is also reviewing the officers' requests to eliminate daily logs 
in which they must list all their activities. He said new computer software the 
department may buy would simplify the daily log, as well as crime reporting 
forms that officers must submit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Encouraged 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Low said he is encouraged by the chief's efforts to address the 
union's concerns. "I think Chief Lentz and John Thomson made an honest effort 
to respond to the questions raised," he said. "I think to the extent that it 
will break down barriers, we'll all be winners." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Levine, attorney for the police union, declined to comment because he 
said he had not seen a copy of the report.

CULVER CITY POLICE APPLY PICKET PRESSURE TO STALLED NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying they felt underpaid and under-appreciated for what they've done to 
reduce crime, Culver City police officers set up picket lines this week to try 
to pressure the city into reopening their stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Holding signs that read, "Culver Council Unfair to Police" and "Can We Talk?," 
dozens of officers on Sunday and Monday picketed Veterans Auditorium, City Hall 
and even council members' homes after bargaining with the city hit an impasse 
and it looked as if the council would renew the existing contract. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, however, with more than 20 officers sitting in the audience 
and picketing outside, the council put off a decision on the contract until 
next month so it could re-examine the city's options. 
</P>
<P>
The city's police officers "go to work every day willing to risk their lives 
for strangers," Sgt. Hank Davies, president of the Culver City Police Officers 
Assn., told the council. "They are deserving of more than you'll ever be able 
to give them. But we're . . . only asking for a little more." 
</P>
<P>
The main thing the officers are seeking, Davies said, is a matching deferred 
compensation plan. This is a supplemental retirement fund to which officers 
could contribute some of their pay, to be matched by a co-payment from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
If the city agrees, Davies said the association would be willing to give up 
on-call court time, which allows an officer under subpoena on his day off to 
collect two hours of pay for staying at home in case he is needed in court. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Personnel Manager Gordon W. Youngs said, however, that city 
officials believe that at an estimated annual cost of $180,000, the 401(k) plan 
is "simply too much" for the city to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Youngs said the city is facing declining revenues and is seeking to avoid 
taxing residents excessively for basic services. The city's position during 
negotiations with all employees, not just police officers, has been to 
restructure compensation packages and use the money saved for benefits that 
would be more cost-effective and widely used. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers' compensation "is at a fair level, in our estimation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The starting salary of $2,674 a month for a rookie and $2,742 for an officer 
transferring from another department is the third-highest among police 
departments in a survey of seven other Los Angeles County cities of similar 
size: El Segundo, Gardena, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Manhattan Beach, Redondo 
Beach and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries are not part of the contract negotiations; a city ordinance adjusts 
officers' salaries twice a year. Officers receive an amount equal to half of 
the average yearly increase given to Los Angeles Police Department officers and 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The officers "tend to forget they are being compensated for their job in the 
salary area and the benefits are supplemental," Youngs said. 
</P>
<P>
Several officers on the picket line Monday pointed to Police Department 
statistics showing that crime in the city has decreased 34% since 1980 and said 
their benefit packages should reflect the job they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council should pay us based on performance," said Detective Steve 
Yoshida, who joined the department three years ago after serving 12 in Redondo 
Beach. "Right now, statistics show that crime is down in Culver City, and 
that's important considering we're surrounded by L.A. We must be doing 
something right." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 83-member association, which represents the department's 
officers and sergeants, will probably go door to door next week to try to 
generate public support for their bargaining position, Davies said. If the city 
does not return to the table, the officers will vote on whether to take job 
actions such as work slowdowns, issuing fewer tickets or calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to consider the issue again at its Sept. 11 meeting, 
Youngs said.

<P>
The city of Pasadena and the Foothill Friends of Music will present the second 
annual Summer Music Festival on the steps of City Hall, 100 N. Garfield Ave., 
beginning at 4:30 p.m. Sunday. The event will be highlighted by a concert by 
the Pasadena Pops Orchestra at 7 p.m. It is free. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, above, more than 1,000 people brought picnic dinners and sang along 
with the afternoon music, which this year will be provided by the Salvation 
Army Tabernacle Band, the First Baptist Church of Pasadena and the Pasadena 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra is a consortium of 70 local professional musicians who also 
perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra 
and the Long Beach Symphony. The musicians organized the orchestra last year to 
provide a forum for the enjoyment of popular and well-known classical music.

RADIO SYSTEM TO HELP SCHOOLS DURING CRISES 
</P>

<P>
After the early-morning earthquake rocked the Los Angeles Basin on Oct. 1, 
1987, frightened students and teachers gathered on the football field at 
Montebello Intermediate School and waited for further instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked out there with 500 kids waiting," remembers Darline Robles, who was 
principal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines were down for three hours, and the school was cut off from the 
district office until maintenance workers were sent out with two-way radios, 
Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some buildings were damaged and aftershocks prevented students and 
staff from entering other buildings, school could not be called off without 
approval of district officials, Robles said. Officials eventually went from 
school to school to assess damage and determine whether to send students home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Use Clear Channel 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the Montebello Unified School District, which includes some 
schools in Monterey Park, purchased a new two-way radio system designed to 
prevent much of the confusion that occurred during the 1987 quake, said Robles, 
who now is the district's assistant superintendent for pupil and community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The new system will allow school officials to switch to a clear channel to 
discuss injuries and damages with district officials and emergency centers. And 
district officials will be able to relay their decisions, such as whether to 
close a school. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the district office) had no way of supporting us," Robles said. "Now 
there will be a sense of security with people that can help us." 
</P>
<P>
The development of a communications system was listed as the top priority by a 
district earthquake preparedness committee that was formed after the 1987 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's report to the Montebello Board of Education said a new system 
was necessary "because of the confusion, the rumors and not being able to get 
in touch with the district during the quake," said Janet Myers, assistant to 
Robles. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education in July, 1988, approved a $200,000 disaster plan that 
included $60,000 for a new emergency communications system linking all schools 
to the district office, the county office of education in Downey -- command 
center for county schools -- and eventually to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department emergency operations center. New equipment arrived recently, and 
employees will begin training next month, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
The county education office has installed a more powerful system that allows 
participants to switch to clear channels during emergencies, said Charles 
Devlin, who oversees the office's communications network. Previously, the 
office was using one channel to keep in touch with 400 buses. "It's like having 
400 buses on a single party (telephone) line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Montebello district is the first to join the county education office's 
emergency system, Devlin said. Other school districts such as Long Beach have 
compatible radio equipment and could easily be connected, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Starkey, maintenance manager for Long Beach Unified, said his district is 
planning to join the emergency network in three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
The radio network has the capacity to handle every school district in the 
county, Devlin said, and several districts have expressed an interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier City School District recently installed a $25,000 two-way radio 
system and may also join.

HOPEFUL AREA SKATERS HIT HOCKEY TRAIL TO CANADIAN COLLEGE 
</P>

When Mike Lyons of La Puente and Richard Auger of Villa Park climb into Lyons' 
new Toyota 4x4 pickup next week, the two 18-year-olds will head for another 
time zone and a new dimension in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-mile journey to Camrose, Canada, will take them across an 
international frontier into a land where miles become kilometers, heat waves 
turn into cold snaps, palm trees become pines, and the closest thing to surfing 
is whitewater canoeing. 
</P>
<P>
They will also brave the adjustment from high school to college, life away from 
parents and friends for the first time and the challenge of developing new 
relationships among peers who say "Eh?" and "aboot" and are ready to guard 
their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Their Holy Grail? The ice hockey team at Camrose Lutheran College, winner of 
nine Canadian college championships in 13 years and host of the Viking Cup 
International Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If they succeed in their fight for ice time, they will not only play alongide 
polished Canadians but against tournament skaters from many foreign countries 
-- including the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they haven't done some polishing in Southern California. Both have 
been playing hockey since the age of 7 -- Lyons as a forward, Auger mostly in 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1988-89 season Lyons was named Player of the Year in the 
Midget bracket (age 17 and under) for both the Southern California Amateur 
Hockey Assn. and Tier II, a Southland all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
He ended with a combined total of 134 points (46 goals, 88 assists), thought to 
be a record, scoring two goals in 17 seconds against Alaska in the Tier II 
regionals. As a Bantam (15 and under) three years ago with a Tier I (all-state) 
team he scored four goals and one assist in the regionals -- once more against 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Auger comes from a hockey family, with a father who once played for a junior 
team in Montreal and older brothers -- even a sister -- who still play street 
hockey. He started as a forward but at age 10 was asked to fill in at goal, got 
a shutout and has worn the big pads ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Asking him about achievements gets a noncommittal answer, but his father said, 
"Even if he won a million dollars he wouldn't tell anybody. He's got about 50 
trophies at home." He has been a team MVP several times, his father said, on 
both the Bantam and Midget levels, and at a hockey camp in British Columbia two 
years ago was named the best of 40 goaltenders participating. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths went to Canada again last year with the Junior Kings, a Tier II 
Midget team, to play a series of games in the Vancouver area. Auger's father 
said he went to a bank with Lyons' father to get Canadian money and they were 
asked about their visit. 
</P>
<P>
"When we told them we were from California and our sons were opening against 
Langley, they just laughed," he said. "Two thousand people showed up to see the 
'massacre,' but we beat them, 4-2." 
</P>
<P>
That was a paid-attendance sellout, and not the only embarrassment for the 
Canadians, as the Kings went on to a 5-5 tie with Trinity Western University, 
lost to Aldergrove, 5-4, and then trimmed the North Shore Winter Club, 3-2. 
North Shore's director said it was the first time in memory his team had lost 
to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons' father said it was Dwayne Lowdermilk, then Trinity's coach, who began 
touting the two Californians, and his interest helped them draw an invitation 
to an elite hockey camp at Montreal in July. When he first described their 
talents, however, to Jean Pronovost of McGill University, a former pro slated 
to teach at the camp, the response was, "Not California players!" 
</P>
<P>
Lowdermilk insisted, Lyons said, describing his son as "one of the smartest 
hockey players he'd ever seen. Not too many players his size can get knocked 
down, buried and get up and put the puck into the net." 
</P>
<P>
Pronovost, who once played in the National Hockey League, relented, to the 
extent that he helped Lowdermilk make a case for the two Californians at 
Camrose, intimating that a year of seasoning there might qualify them to play 
for McGill. Camrose competes in the Canadian Colleges Athletic Assn., a level 
of play just below that of McGill's circuit, the Canadian Intercollegiate 
Athletic Union, which includes the country's bigger schools. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Luke, coach at Camrose, said there is a pretty good chance both youths 
will make his team, since this is a rebuilding year and Lowdermilk's appraisal 
impressed him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an excellent judge of hockey players," Luke said, "their skills as well 
as their personality and desire to succeed. Lyons and Auger seem to have a real 
interest in education as well as hockey." 
</P>
<P>
If they make it, they will be the first Californians to play for Camrose. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyons may have it easier than Auger," Luke said. "We have only six returning 
veterans up front and will carry a squad of 26. Auger will be bucking a fair 
number of young candidates for goalie, plus one veteran. We carry three in the 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
"It mostly depends on the investment they plan to make. If they're going for a 
degree here, the possibilities are wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"We play without a center line so our style is freer, faster, with very intense 
forechecking and more pressure on defense and the goalie. They'll have to get 
used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons admitted he was a little nervous about leaving home and the challenge up 
north. "I need to get bigger," he said. "I've been lifting weights." Currently 
tipping the scales at 155 and measuring 5-11, he is shooting for 185 or 190 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"You need size because of the intimidation factor," he said. "A big guy can 
psyche you out in the corners." 
</P>
<P>
Auger too is lifting weights, but not because a goalie needs bulk. "You can 
always be in better shape," he said. "Speed is more important in goal than 
size." He weighs 170, at a compact 5-10, and is running to improve endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Auger is looking forward to the change in scenery, including snow. "That will 
be a first for me," he said. "It's going to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
All they'll need is snow tires for jaunts 50 miles -- er, 80 kilometers -- 
northwest to Edmonton, to roam the world's largest shopping mall (20 movie 
theaters, world's largest largest indoor amusement park), or northeast to 
Vegreville to gawk at the world's largest Easter egg. When Lyons is as 
confident with the stick shift as he is with a hockey stick, they could even 
tackle Drumheller, 160 kilometers south and home of the world's foremost 
dinosaur museum. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mounties will get them if they don't listen up: Those speed-limit signs 
reading "100" mean kilometers; try 62.5 if that speedometer is just calibrated 
U.S.

PRESIDENT'S HIRING HEATS UP COLLEGE BOARD RACE 
</P>

<P>
The Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees campaign has barely started, 
and already a dispute over the recent hiring of a college president threatens 
to dominate the battle of two incumbents for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
One board member has questioned whether incumbents Hilda Solis and Isabelle 
Gonthier paid attention to what area residents wanted when they voted to hire 
Alex Sanchez, a former vice president at the University of New Mexico in 
Albuquerque, as college president. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was talking to our community, the constituents said it would be nice if 
we could have someone who knows our community," board member Ralph Pacheco 
said. "I listened to my community." 
</P>
<P>
The two, however, defend their decision, saying they chose Sanchez because he 
was the best person for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Solis said that Pacheco's comments are unwarranted and that she fears the race 
will be marred by mudslinging and back-stabbing, with the disagreement over 
Sanchez at the center of debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Distasteful Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"It is a distasteful situation," Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people in addition to Solis and Gonthier are also running in the Nov. 7 
election. Five of the candidates are vying for a seat being vacated by Marilee 
Morgan, who is retiring after 14 years on the board. Solis, board president, 
has two challengers. Gonthier, a two-term member, has one. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Sanchez started last spring when Solis, Gonthier and Morgan 
found themselves at odds with Pacheco and one other board member. 
</P>
<P>
The three wanted to hire Sanchez, but Pacheco and Bill E. Hernandez favored Los 
Angeles Community College District administrator Frank Alderete. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pacheco, the two thought that Alderete was a better choice for the 
heavily Latino college because he grew up in California and understood the 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, on the other hand, was a native of New Mexico and would need to learn 
the area, Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees voted 3 to 2 to hire Sanchez, who was described as an excellent 
administrator.

"Alex Sanchez was by far the best candidate," Solis said. "That was the 
overriding reason for hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a personal decision," she said. "In my mind it was a decision that 
was best for the community." 
</P>
<P>
The three board members also felt that Sanchez could serve as a "healer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Integrity' 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said at the time that Sanchez was "someone with a great deal of 
community outreach, a lot of integrity and sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
The two incumbents said they want to put the dispute behind them and deal with 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the college's teachers also could become a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' contract expired June 30, and although administrators have been 
talking with union representatives to draw up a new agreement, nothing has been 
completed. Sanchez said he hopes agreement can be reached in early September, 
when both sides will meet formally. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco said the incumbents' performance during the negotiations will be 
closely watched. "I'm optimistic that we will come to an agreement (with 
teachers), but someone is going to have to give." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations "will test my colleagues' leadership," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The following people have filed papers to run in the Rio Hondo Community 
College Board of Trustees election: 
</P>
<P>
Area 1: David Flores, Hilda Solis (incumbent) and Elizabeth Van Note. 
</P>
<P>
Area 3: Isabelle Gonthier (incumbent) and Ceci Medina. 
</P>
<P>
Area 5: Clair Buchholz, Louis Edward Caldera, Denos (Gus) Carras, Herb Griffith 
and Barbara Stone.

A HOT TIME AT THE ICE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDY CLUB TO CELEBRATE 30 YEARS OF LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By the time Kat Simmons goes on, the audience at the Ice House in Pasadena has 
already been goaded, charmed, ambushed and tickled by a half-dozen other 
stand-up comics, and everybody's haw-hawing merrily along. Most of the familiar 
targets have been trotted out: game show hosts, hyperactive kids, K mart, fat 
ladies in stretch pants, the save-the-whales movement, "Fantasy Island," 
liposuction and, memorably, Kellogg's Mueslix cereal. 
</P>
<P>
"In Switzerland, that means wholesome goodness," says Eric Pielstieck, speaking 
in the rounded tones of a television commercial voice-over. Then his eyes go 
stony, and his voice shifts gears. "Maybe," he snaps. "But in this country, 
partner, it means you've got a sinus condition and maybe you should cut back on 
the dairy products." 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday-night audience clamors for more. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, redheaded Simmons totters onto the stage, big wedges of brass 
dangling from her ears and a crooked, irrepressible grin on her face. The crowd 
titters as she sizes them up. They're a lot better than her last audience, she 
tells them. That was in a psychiatric ward. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an audience of paranoid schizophrenics," she says. "There were 15 of 
them. Seemed like it was 30." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, a new comic who is just starting to venture into the rocky terrain of 
dinner theaters, small-town comedy bars, one-nighters in Palm Springs and 
"open-mike" nights at the established clubs, is fast becoming a connoisseur of 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The tough ones, she says between sets, are the dinner-club crowds ("You have to 
wait 'till everybody swallows and pays attention") or audiences that have 
already been conditioned to lewdness by the last comic. "If you follow a comic 
whose mind is in the gutter, you seem like Mary Poppins following Arnold 
Schwarzenegger with a hemorrhoid," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But the best audiences? No question. They're at the Ice House in Pasadena, says 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
Stand-up comedy, concentrated in a handful of big-city clubs until the early 
1980s, is now performed in more than 200 clubs in 41 states, according to 
comedy trade publications. The widely reported "comedy boom" has new clubs 
popping up like mushrooms, from Bossier City, La., to Kent, Wash. The Pasadena 
club, however, is already at the threshold of middle age. The Ice House -- a 
tidy little place with an entrance on an alley, a small side room and a main 
room that echoes with giggles and guffaws -- will be 30 years old next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not laying claim to being the oldest comedy house in the country," says 
owner Bob Fisher, a short, bearded man who watches his performers cut up on 
stage with wooden-faced detachment. "But put it this way. Steve Martin was 
doing comedy here 12 years before the Comedy Store (one of Los Angeles' 
premiere clubs) opened." 
</P>
<P>
It's an intimate place, with no one sitting farther than about 25 feet from the 
stage. The chairs are straight, the tables tiny and the walls unadorned brick 
-- all deliberately Spartan. "No carpet, no acoustic tile," Fisher explains. 
"The room stays lively." 
</P>
<P>
It's also, as far as many comedians are concerned, unusually 
performer-friendly. For people who routinely cross swords with hecklers, drunks 
and the generally unresponsive, the Ice House usually offers appreciative 
audiences. "It's like comedy heaven," says Barbara Scott, an Ice House regular, 
whose act often includes a send-up of a steamy guitar-playing torch singer. 
"You don't have to prove yourself over and over again. Because you're on the 
stage, they seem to accept the fact that you're funny." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena club debuted in 1959 as a folk music cafe. Even then, comedians 
were usually part of the show, says Fisher. Lily Tomlin, the Smothers Brothers 
and Bob Newhart cut early records there. In the early 1960s, Pat Paulsen 
stirred things up by pouring paint on his head and swinging head-down from a 
rope in the main room, letting his hair brush across blank pieces of paper. 
He'd sell his "cranial paintings" to members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"There was comedy here from Day 1," says Fisher, who bought the Ice House in 
1978 and turned into an all-comedy venue. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy boom may be, as some cynics suggest, just a cheap way of getting 
customers into a bar ("You get a headliner for $900 and two other guys for 
$200, and you sell $5,000 worth of liquor," says one road-hardened comic), but 
it's drawing hundreds of new young performers into the field. 
</P>
<P>
With comedians making it big in the movies, cable television companies planning 
all-comedy channels and that national network of comedy clubs getting bigger 
all the time, the opportunities seem endless. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's a comic nowadays," says veteran comedian Sam Kwasman, another Ice 
House regular. "Everybody's got five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But few among the 2,000 or so comics making the rounds in the United 
States are getting rich at it. "It's really just an expensive habit," says 
Scott, who traveled to the Ice House from Venice last week to perform for free, 
just so she could make a videotape of her performance. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders find it difficult to grasp the pressurized, manic-depressive world of 
the comedian, with its lonely pursuit of laughter, comedians say. "Comedy is a 
serious business," says Kwasman, a former dancer who does cartoon voices in his 
act (he recently auditioned to replace the late Mel Blanc as Elmer Fudd and 
Yosemite Sam). 
</P>
<P>
In the Pasadena club's Green Room, a sitting room where comedians waiting their 
turn can watch what's happening on stage through closed-circuit television 
("Just like Johnny Carson," says Fisher), the talk often turns to the 
frustrations of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing open-mike night at the Improv (another major Los Angeles club) 
tomorrow," says Simmons, who gave up a job as a Lake Tahoe real estate broker 
to pursue comedy. "Last time I did it, they told me I'd be fourth. I waited 12 
hours to go on for five minutes. It's real humbling, but it keeps you doing the 
footwork." 
</P>
<P>
Wade and Karen Sheeler, a comedy duo, toast each other gaily with antacid 
bottles -- each with a straw and a little paper parasol -- and Pielstieck 
calmly paces the floor, getting in the mood for his first ever stand-up 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
There's usually a mutually protective camaraderie among them all, from 
hungry-eyed young pistoleros to comedians who have already done Carson and 
Letterman, says Simmons. "People warn you about working for a guy in Phoenix, 
because he'll stiff you, or another guy who physically hit a female comic who 
wasn't receptive to his advances," she says. "A lot of icky stuff happens on 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
The show unfolds rapidly. Bill Kelly, a bespectacled and overweight young man 
from Illinois, hitches up his pants and talks about a "religious experience" in 
his hometown. "My mother found a silhouette of the Virgin Mary in the lint 
trap," he says. Sheeler &amp; Sheeler do fast-paced skits about Siamese twin 
detectives and about a pair of game show hosts on a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
He: You can keep the flowers! 
</P>
<P>
She (gesturing dramatically): Suggested retail price -- $8.95! 
</P>
<P>
Pielstieck does his mad tirades, John Robisch plays an endearing clod and Jim 
Fleming, a young man with cerebral palsy, improvises on his own disability. 
</P>
<P>
There's an underlying pessimism to most comics, says Robisch, after his 
performance. "We all grew up as the class clowns," he says. "There's a need for 
attention. Tear away the facade and it's not a pretty sight." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons trots out some familiar targets of her own: feminine hygiene products, 
self-serve gas stations, small towns. She's from Gardnerville, Nev., she tells 
the audience in her good-natured manner -- "where men are men, and sheep have 
their own rape crisis hot line." 
</P>
<P>
The audience (liberally sprinkled with Simmons' friends) loves it. "They were 
putty," she says pleasurably later on. "I could have stayed on for an hour."

SANTA MONICAN EARNS OARS IN HENLEY REGATTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM MARCHIANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the little town of Henley, historic boathouses line the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is a 60-year-old gentleman in his one-man scull out for a pleasant 
afternoon on the river, or a heavyweight university team trying to beat its 
best time, rowing has been, is and looks to always be a way of life in England. 
</P>
<P>
And in this particular town, the sport is celebrated in elaborate fashion. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a century rowers from around the world and rowers close to home 
have descended upon Henley at the end of June to participate in a five-day 
grind, the Henley Regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the thousands of athletes and spectators, predominantly from Western 
Europe and American East Coast cities, was Brian Wachler, a Southern 
Californian. 
</P>
<P>
Far from his modest tree-lined street in Santa Monica, Wachler was engulfed in 
a world of striped blazers, strawberries and cream and pints of Pimm's during 
last month's 150th Henley Regatta. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most incredible sporting event I've ever been to," Wachler said. 
"Over the years it has developed to a real intensity on the water -- but a 
social event on the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Wachler, who rowed junior varsity crew for UCLA during his freshman and 
sophomore years, learned to appreciate both the social and competitive aspects 
of the event as a member of the University of Edinburgh heavyweight team. The 
eight-man boat finished sixth in a field of 76 that competed in the Thames Cup, 
the most competitive of the college races. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from UCLA last June, Wachler accepted a Rotary club 
scholarship to study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Rotary grants undergraduate and graduate scholarships to students with 
communicative skills, dedication to public service and an interest in 
international travel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to studying European history, philosophy and art at Edinburgh, 
Wachler rekindled his love for rowing after a two-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a wide range of interests and I wanted to develop some of my other 
skills," said the 22-year-old Wachler, who begins Dartmouth medical school this 
fall. "But rowing basically started in Britain, and so what better place to row 
than Europe?" 
</P>
<P>
While Americans and European rowers are on par with each other technically, 
Wachler says a different approach to coaching on a collegiate level enhanced 
his experience in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
At Edinburgh, the coach only supervises on the water. Land training and 
administrative duties were the responsibility of the students. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who stuck with the program were committed and self-motivated," 
Wachler explained. "Here in the States you have your coach and he's like a 
father figure, a disciplinarian." 
</P>
<P>
For Wachler, the transition on the water was simple enough, but transcending 
the cultural disparities took a little more time. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, Americans are very friendly, but the British are more reserved," 
said Wachler, an animated and talkative person. "The British 
</P>
<P>
view American friendliness as being a little superficial because how can you be 
so enthusiastic when you don't know someone? I learned to tone it down a bit 
until I established a rapport." 
</P>
<P>
By April, Wachler had mastered some social graces and secured his trip to 
Henley. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing all eight members of the heavyweight boat early gave Edinburgh 
ample time to prepare for the regatta. "Since we solidified the boat early, we 
had time to gel," Wachler said of the boat, which included an American coxswain 
and stroke man. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a common level of commitment that was very important because there 
wasn't always a common level of ability, so being committed is what I think 
really made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Henley course is unusual for two reasons. The standard course length for 
international competition is 2,000 meters, but Henley measures one mile and 550 
yards. Also, crews race upstream, making it more strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it's longer than a normal race when you're used to a sprint, you have to 
wait longer at Henley. And upstream, a race that's normally six minutes is 45 
seconds to a minute longer," Wachler said. "Any race you're tired -- but these 
especially. It's a tough day." 
</P>
<P>
Difficult as the Henley course may be, the regatta only strengthened Wachler's 
passion for rowing. 
</P>
<P>
"There something about rowing that is both charming and seductive. It's 
exhilarating to push your body to the limit and know that everyone in the boat 
is too," Wachler said. "Everyone is doing the same thing and it's your will 
against the will of the other boat. If one person gives up, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
At Henley, Wachler didn't give up and it does not look like he will give up on 
rowing in the near future. Despite the rigors of medical school, Wachler is 
eager to row for the Dartmouth Rowing Club. Rowing has become part of his life.

UCI WILL STAY IN MEDI-CAL DESPITE EXPECTED LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine officials decided Wednesday to renew their hospital's contract with 
the state Medi-Cal system, ending months of threats that they might quit the 
state program and plunge health care for Orange County's poor into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Jack W. Peltason said he was pleased with the one-year contract 
because it improves deficit-ridden UCI Medical Center's reimbursement rate from 
the state. Even so, the new contract is expected to leave the university 
hospital with millions of dollars in losses this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Peltason warned, though a contract has finally been signed, "I want to 
make it very clear that the crisis in health-care access for the indigent in 
Orange County is not over." 
</P>
<P>
He said that state Medi-Cal officials must still persuade more of the county's 
38 acute-care hospitals to take indigent patients. "If that objective is not 
achieved, the crisis will worsen," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the California Medical Assistance Commission, which negotiates 
Medi-Cal contracts, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Commitments 
</P>
<P>
But Peltason and other UCI administrators said that before they renewed the 
contract, they received commitments from CMAC, county supervisors, state 
legislators and state Health and Welfare Agency Secretary Clifford L. Allenby 
that they would work together to rebuild Orange County's Medi-Cal network. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a gentlepersons' agreement that the network issue will be addressed," 
said Mary A. Piccione, the medical center administrator who led UCI's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The university hospital, which is located in Orange, cares for about 65% of 
Orange County's poor but has only 6% of the county's hospital beds. 
</P>
<P>
Besides UCI, only 12 of Orange County's 38 acute-care hospitals have Medi-Cal 
contracts. But if UCI had dropped out of the Medi-Cal network, administrators 
from at least two of the 12 had vowed that their hospitals would quit the 
program too. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a UCI decision to quit Medi-Cal would have made it difficult for 
thousands of Medi-Cal patients to find non-emergency treatment, advocates for 
the poor had warned. 
</P>
<P>
Around the county, health care leaders reacted to UCI's decision Wednesday with 
a mixture of surprise and relief -- surprise because some had become convinced 
that UCI would quit the program, and relief because they believed that the few 
remaining Medi-Cal hospitals would have been inundated with patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good for Health Care' 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for health care in Orange County and good for the patients," said 
David Archer, chief operating officer of AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove, 
which had threatened to pull out of Medi-Cal if UCI did. 
</P>
<P>
"As everyone has said, it would certainly bring about a crisis within Orange 
County if they did not come to an agreement. We all would not be happy to face 
that crisis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. Uram, director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, praised UCI 
officials' "endurance and negotiating ability." Uram also said that he believed 
UCI's unprecedented tough stance had persuaded Medi-Cal officials to give other 
hospitals improved contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Hospital Council of Southern California, Vice President Jon Gilwee 
agreed with Peltason that health care for Orange County's poor was still in a 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's decision to remain with Medi-Cal "preserves the network -- but not a very 
good one," Gilwee said. "The Medi-Cal program still funds only 65% of the cost 
of delivering services" and a poor person's access to non-emergency services in 
Orange County is severely limited now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that all hospitals have been struggling with major losses in regard to 
indigent care; in Orange County, the losses totaled $240 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began Talking in January 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials began negotiating with Medi-Cal for a new contract in January. 
</P>
<P>
By March, they told the UC Board of Regents that they might quit the 
state-financed health insurance program to save their hospital from financial 
disaster. Indigent patients were inundating their medical training programs and 
crowding out patients who could pay, UCI officials contended. The medical 
center lost $11.6 million in the 1988-89 fiscal year and was rapidly heading 
toward bankruptcy, officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
In late July, UCI officials got support from the regents to terminate the 
Medi-Cal contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still Peltason, Piccione and her deputy, Herb Spiwak, kept talking to CMAC 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Helpful in persuading UCI to renew the contract, Peltason said, were meetings 
that he and Vice Chancellor Walter Henry had Friday with each of the county 
supervisors. "Nobody made a commitment to do anything specific," Peltason said, 
"but there's a concern and willingness" to share the burden of health care for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
By law, details of state Medi-Cal contracts are confidential and Peltason and 
Piccione declined to provide any information Wednesday. They did say that one 
element of the contract, which runs from Sept. 16 of this year to Sept. 15, 
1990, was an increase in the medical center's reimbursement rate. (At one 
point, UCI leaders told the Board of Regents that they were seeking a 17% 
increase). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Key Element 
</P>
<P>
Another key element, they said, was the commitment from CMAC that other Orange 
County hospitals would be brought into the Medi-Cal system. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract has not yet been signed, but Piccione said Wednesday morning 
that she informed CMAC officials that "we agree to agree." 
</P>
<P>
She said the medical center would be closely monitoring the number of Medi-Cal 
"patient days" (overnight stays) at the hospital, currently about 50,000 a 
year. "Reduction in the number . . . will signal that the (Medi-Cal network) is 
being restored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Piccione also noted that the hospital's "obstetrical diversion" policy, in 
which maternity patients are asked to find other hospitals when UCI is full, 
would continue despite the new contract. Severe overcrowding in the maternity 
ward continues despite the diversion policy, she said. The maternity ward, 
which is licensed for 250 deliveries a month, expects to handle 600 this month.

THE 55: KING OF DIAMOND LANES; 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY LEADS CAR-POOL HIT PARADE FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Love them or hate them, the much-debated car-pool lanes that run on the Costa 
Mesa Freeway down the middle of Orange County are the busiest in the state. But 
just wait. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction may not last long. Car-pool lanes are expected to open in two 
weeks along much of the southbound San Diego Freeway, north of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway. And by next spring, when the diamond lanes are completed along the 
entire length of the San Diego Freeway in Orange County, it may well assume the 
top spot soon after the ribbon is cut, state Department of Transportation 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, the diamond lanes stretching along the Costa Mesa 
Freeway (California 55) have the record, carrying about 22,000 people a day in 
each direction. The highway quietly took the top spot in mid-1987 from the El 
Monte transitway on the San Bernardino Freeway, but the record drew little 
notice outside Caltrans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 22,000 people use the car-pool lanes in each direction every 24 
hours on the Costa Mesa Freeway, followed by nearly 14,000 on the El Monte 
transitway and about 7,000 on the commuter lane that runs eastbound along 
California 91. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it as a successful operation," said Joe El Harake, Orange County 
commuter-lanes coordinator for Caltrans. "When we opened the car-pool lanes on 
the 55, we never thought we'd have so much utilization of them. This is a 
positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a bit of bad news. With the popularity of the car-pool lanes 
soaring, the average time saved by commuters who use the lanes has dropped. 
When the lanes were introduced in November, 1985, a motorist could save 17 
minutes compared to someone sitting in traffic, El Harake said. Today, the 
car-pool lane shaves off 10 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very nice incentive," El Harake said. "To the average motorist, 
that is a tremendous savings, and there is a definite psychological advantage 
to be in a lane that keeps moving." 
</P>
<P>
Initially opened as a one-year experiment to test the car-pool concept in 
Orange County, the restricted lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway have survived a 
rash of criticism from groups opposed to the notion of setting aside a strip of 
asphalt for cars with two or more occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have gone to great lengths to get their point across, doing 
everything from handing out leaflets to motorists at freeway on-ramps to 
picketing the Caltrans offices. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the grass-roots group Drivers for Highway Safety has targeted 
the freeway's diamond lanes for ridicule, saying they pose a danger by sending 
commuters zooming within inches of cars poking along in unrestricted lanes 
congested by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Catron, president of the group, questioned whether the Costa Mesa Freeway's 
car-pool lanes truly are the most heavily used, suggesting that Caltrans 
officials have skewed the statistics to affect the public's opinion of the 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy that at all," Catron said. "I definitely would question their 
numbers. As we have in the past, I would question their counting methods. 
There's been lots of inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
El Harake of Caltrans, however, said the proof is right there on the freeway. 
The Costa Mesa freeway has been the busiest since mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
While the El Monte transit-way, which is heavily traveled by commuter-laden 
buses, features greater flows during peak commuting hours, the Costa Mesa 
Freeway's commuter lanes have more extended use at other times of the day and 
night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though they flow freely most hours of the day, the Costa Mesa Freeway's 
car-pool lanes actually carry twice as many people during rush hour as the 
freeway's other lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The car-pool lane also accommodates more cars than the freeway's other lanes 
during peak hours. One recent afternoon, for example, the car-pool lane was 
used by more than 1,500 cars between 5 and 6 p.m. The three other lanes ranged 
between about 1,400 and 1,100 cars during the hour, El Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are eager to open additional car-pool lanes in the county, 
in particular along the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Freeway, the second most heavily traveled highway in the world, 
just behind the busy Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, is used by as many as 
300,000 cars a day along some stretches in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-mile section of the northbound car-pool lane was finished between 
Brookhurst Street and the San Gabriel River Freeway in late spring. In early 
September, the southbound car-pool lane will be opened from the San Gabriel 
River Freeway to Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of car-pool lanes along the freeway between Fairview and 
Interstate 5 is expected to be completed by spring. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes are also featured in construction plans along Interstate 5.

COUNCIL VOTES TO RAISE WATER RATES ABOUT 6% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council has voted unanimously to increase water rates citywide 
by an average of about 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The rate hike will produce about $1.2 million more in revenue, which will be 
used to pay for cost increases in service maintenance, fire hydrant maintenance 
and the addition of staff to take care of new water facilities, according to a 
city report. 
</P>
<P>
The average residential monthly water bill will go from $16.65 to $17.76. The 
rate increases take effect Sept. 1.

COUNCIL GIVES FINAL OK TO OZONE-PROTECTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a plea by businesses to delay action, the City Council gave final 
approval Tuesday night to the nation's most sweeping ordinance aimed at 
reducing the use of chemicals and compounds that erode the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance affects a wide range of products and services, including 
air-conditioner repair, manufacture of computer components, building insulation 
and fast-food packaging. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, several businesses urged the council to delay final 
approval, contending that the city law is flawed and that more time is needed 
to iron out some of the uncertainties involving exemptions to the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Chamber of Commerce asked the council to delete the misdemeanor 
sanctions that can be imposed against businesses and to make the program 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Larry Agran, who has spearheaded the ordinance, replied that the law 
is "superb legislation," adding that voluntary compliance is not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with voluntary compliance is that you can have voluntary 
noncompliance . . . and then where are we?" Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance bans the use of several compounds and requires recycling of 
certain compounds used in air conditioning and refrigeration. It allows 
exemptions when no substitute compounds are available or in the case of small 
emissions, making recycling or replacement too costly. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan cast the sole dissenting vote.

CITY RECYCLING PROGRAM IS SPARING THOSE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fast approaching its second year in operation, Irvine's curbside-recycling 
program has collected enough old newspapers to save 95,000 trees this year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Recycles, which enjoys widespread support among Irvine residents, 
collected more than 5,500 tons of recyclable waste this fiscal year. According 
to a study released this week, every ton of newspaper collected saves 17 trees 
35 feet tall. Residents place glass, certain plastics, aluminum and newspapers 
in stacking bins, which are collected outside their homes each week. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that 71% of the homeowners participate in the recycling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal wasn't financial, it was environmental," said MaryAnne 
Hetherington-Wysard, management analyst for the program. "It might be costing 
us a bit more to recycle these products, but we are simply diverting dumping in 
Coyote Canyon dump." 
</P>
<P>
That dump, which serves all of southern Orange County, is estimated to be 
nearing capacity. City officials hope that other cities will follow their lead 
and adopt similar recycling programs. Officials from Laguna Beach, Anaheim and 
Los Angeles have already inquired about the Irvine program, officials said.. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday night's City Council meeting, Hetherington-Wysard announced plans to 
step up promotion of the program to increase response. A six-minute video on 
how the system works, designed to persuade other cities to follow suit, was 
shown to the council.

MAN, YOUTHS WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man and two teen-age boys were injured by several shotgun blasts 
fired from a car in a gang-related, drive-by shooting, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Acosta, 21, and two 15-year-old boys, whose names were withheld because 
of their age, were standing at Citron Street and Victor Avenue about 11:25 p.m. 
Tuesday, when shots were fired from a car, according to Police Lt. John Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the three wounded on the sidewalk, Cross said. Two were shot in 
the legs and the other in the arm. The three were hospitalized in stable 
condition Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the shots were fired from a red Ford Mustang 
containing four men who then sped away northbound on Citron Street, Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, police found the Mustang crashed into a tree at Romneya Drive, 
east of Euclid Street. Police recovered the shotgun believed to have been used 
in the attack, but the four menhad fled, Cross said.

RABBI HENRI E. FRONT, 61, COMMUNITY LEADER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Henri E. Front, one of the leading liberal voices of the Jewish community 
in Orange County, died Wednesday at age 61 after a brief bout with pancreatic 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A former chairman and current member of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, Front had been head of the Temple Beth David in Westminster since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said: "Rabbi Front was not only a 
religious leader, but a civic and cultural activist who practiced his faith in 
his everyday deeds. His main credo was the Hebrew word tzedekah (justice). . . 
. His death is not only a loss to his family and congregation, but to Orange 
County as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel H. Ninburg, the immediate past chairman of the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission, said Front "was a leading light in the community. . . . 
He had a strong feeling for the underprivileged and those who are discriminated 
against for whatever reason." 
</P>
<P>
Active in interfaith efforts, Front was invited in 1986 by the Islamic society 
of Orange County to speak about Judaism. Dr. Mohamed J. Khan, the former 
president of the society, said, "Rabbi Front presented Judaism in a very nice 
way. He educated us in the broad principles of Judaism. . . . He was a very 
broad-minded man. I believe he belongs not only to the Jews, but to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Front, born in Wheeling, W.Va., was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1953. 
He received his doctor of Hebrew letters in 1963 and his doctor of divinity in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
An active leader in the reform Jewish community, Front was president of both 
the Pacific Assn. of Reform Rabbis and the Orange County Board of Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in the Navy as a chaplain in Okinawa, he became the rabbi at the 
Temple Menorah in Redondo Beach and served there from 1957 to '62. After 
working for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in Pennsylvania from 
1963 to '68, he returned to Los Angeles, first as a rabbi at the Wilshire 
Boulevard Temple and later at the Beth Sholom Temple in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Front is survived by his wife, Regina B. Front; two children, Seth and Jackie; 
and his mother, Julia F. Steinberg.

QUAYLE'S HOST BRINGS SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS TO THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buck Johns said he figures he was selected as host for Vice President Dan 
Quayle's Orange County reception tonight because Republican Party leaders think 
"he'll tolerate it and he's nuts." He was only partly joking. 
</P>
<P>
His tennis court is big enough to accommodate 500 people. "That narrows it 
quite a bit," Johns said. "I imagine probably by default they picked me." 
</P>
<P>
Johns and his wife, Colleen, have made their tennis court available for 
numerous events featuring many prominent Republicans, including Gov. George 
Deukmejian, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson of California and Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas during his bid for the nomination for President. 
</P>
<P>
But both the Johnses said preparing for Quayle was a different matter. They 
have planted their Santa Ana Heights yard with jasmine, geraniums and other 
flowers, painted and wallpapered parts of their sprawling home, even 
straightened their dresser drawers in preparation for the reception. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had the vice president before so we're very pumped up about it," said 
Johns, an Arkansas native who never lost the Southern twang. Said Colleen 
Johns: "There's something so different about this. It's a real honor to be 
hosting him in Orange County, much less in your own home." 
</P>
<P>
The boyish-looking Johns, 47, is a well-known figure in Orange County political 
circles. He is a longtime member of the Lincoln Club, the county's best-known 
and most prestigious Republican support group, where he and businessmen John 
Cronin and Doy Henley represent the more conservative wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the lack of an organized statewide effort to gain Republican 
seats in the Assembly, Cronin, Henley and Johns last year came up with Project 
'90. The effort was aimed at raising money for Assembly races in an attempt to 
get a GOP majority there before the redistricting that will follow the 1990 
census. Among the fund-raising events was an auction, which was held on Johns' 
tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
But the project largely failed last fall when Democrats made gains in the 
Assembly, virtually securing their majority in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Johns is owner of the Inland Group, a firm that acquires land and obtains 
rights to build on property in Riverside and San Bernardino counties that is 
then developed by others. 
</P>
<P>
The four Johns children, ranging in age from 7 to 14, are joining in the 
activities for tonight's reception. They have even cleaned up their rooms, just 
in case Quayle should stop in to see them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in the thick of it," Johns said.

BODY FOUND AFTER CAR FIRE IN GARAGE OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A charred, unidentified body of a man was discovered in the garage of a Laguna 
Niguel home Wednesday morning after firefighters put out a small car fire, 
Orange County sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's bomb squad was called when it appeared that an explosion might 
have started the fire. Investigators released a statement late Wednesday that 
they still were trying to determine the cause. 
</P>
<P>
The body, found in a sitting position inside the car, apparently was burned 
beyond recognition, Sheriff's Department officials said. It was taken to the 
county coroner's office in Santa Ana, where an autopsy was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokeswoman said dental records had been acquired to help confirm 
the identify of the body. She declined to say who investigators think victim is 
or who lives at the home in the 24300 block of Nugget Falls Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they noticed smoke pouring from the sides of the garage door at 
the house just before noon. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some glass breaking," said Matthew Casebier, 21, who lives across the 
street from where the body was found. "Then I heard someone screaming for me to 
call the Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
Casebier said that before county firefighters could arrive, he and a worker at 
a nearby house under construction rushed across the street and threw open the 
front door of the three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see anybody," Casebier said. Opening the garage door, Casebier said, 
he found a 1986 Toyota Camry engulfed in flames. "I ran back outside." 
</P>
<P>
The construction worker, who identified himself only as John, said he was 
driving down the street when he spotted the fire. "The garage was full of 
smoke. It was pouring out," he said. "The body was just sitting there" in the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Casebier and other neighbors said that the Nugget Falls Lane home is owned by a 
Vietnamese family that moved into the brand-new, $250,000 home two months ago.

GANG GUNFIRE WOUNDS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Santa Ana youth was shot in the arm Wednesday afternoon after 
three cars drove past him and shouted gang slogans, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was standing in front of a house at the 3200 block of South 
Townsend Street in Santa Ana at about 3 p.m. when three cars filled with 
several people drove by and shouted the names of several gangs, according to 
Lt. Earl Porter. 
</P>
<P>
He was then wounded when one or two shots were fired from one of the vehicles, 
Porter said. The youth was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. Porter said it is 
unknown whether the victim is a member of a gang. 
</P>
<P>
The police do not have any suspects, Porter said. The weapon is believed to be 
a 9-millimeter handgun. The cars were described at two dark-colored Chevrolets 
and one gray import car.

HERRMANN INSISTS HE'LL BE READY, BUT DILS MIGHT MAKE RETURN VISIT

Mark Herrmann isn't sure what the fuss is about. While the Rams were scrambling 
to find a replacement for the backup quarterback, who cracked a rib in Monday 
night's game, Herrmann spoke matter-of-factly about being in uniform for the 
Sept. 10 opener in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real confident," he said Wednesday. "That's 2 1/2 weeks away. I think I 
should be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Taking no chances, the Rams put out an all-quarterbacks bulletin that included 
a phone call to 33-year-old Steve Dils, who is selling commercial real estate 
in Atlanta. Dils was a longtime backup with the Rams and knows the system. He 
was released last fall, claimed on waivers by Atlanta but wasn't offered a 
contract in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Dils was mulling over the proposition, which is basically this: take 
a few snaps in practice for a couple weeks and be ready should Herrmann not be 
available for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy isn't coming in here to compete," Coach John Robinson said. 
"Herrmann's the two. There's nobody that's going to come in and take his place. 
You're buying insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Dils is the logical short-term answer, should he wish to accept such a role. He 
was supposed to get back to the Rams today with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback coach Dick Coury said it wouldn't take Dils long to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
"We could hand him a playbook on the bus on the way to the game," Coury said. 
"I think he could get in shape in about 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann's ribs, meanwhile, were feeling much better, he reported. He says he 
could play in the Atlanta game at even less than 100% 
</P>
<P>
"You can always wear protective padding," he said. "And there's not any 
guarantee I'd be in the game anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Stewart, the former Cal State Fullerton Titan and eighth-round pick of the 
Vikings, has a broken hand and won't make the trip west for Saturday night's 
game against the Rams. The original break didn't set properly and surgery was 
required. Stewart, a defensive end, had two pins inserted in the hand and is 
wearing a cast extending to his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Coach Jerry Burns said Stewart had been making progress, though not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we just have him in conditioning drills and things of that 
consequence," Burns said, "but if he ever makes a decision to discipline 
himself from a football standpoint and a personal standpoint he can play in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Mike Williams, the team's 10th-round pick, underwent arthroscopic 
surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee. Williams is expected to be 
out four to six weeks. . . . Steve Miles, a Rams' public relations assistant, 
announced his resignation Wednesday and intends to explore other opportunities. 
Miles had taken the job vacated by Doug Ward, who resigned last summer for 
similar reasons. . . . Coach John Robinson said holdout first-pick Cleveland 
Gary has greatly hurt his chances to contribute this season. "I think he can 
contribute, but I think it would be in a selective role," Robinson said. "And 
that role would expand as the season goes along. He's a real good player, no 
question about it." . . . The Rams and Gary's agent are talking again but 
remain more than a million dollars apart.. . . Mark Herrmann said he didn't 
take offense to the third-quarter safety blitz by Phoenix safety Tim McDonald 
that caused his injury. "They blitzed a lot in the first game we saw," Herrmann 
said of the Cardinals' exhibition opener against Seattle. "They got 
(quarterback) Jeff Kemp a number of times. That's part of the game. I can't 
fault them for that." . . . Herrmann wasn't wearing a flak jacket at the time 
of the hit, but plans to wear one from now on. . . . Safety James Washington 
had his knee examined Wednesday but no damage was revealed.

HEFFERN QUITS CDM TO COACH MIKE BRIGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Heffern, Corona del Mar High School tennis coach for the past 10 years, 
said he has resigned to coach Mike Briggs, a former Corona del Mar and UC 
Irvine player, on the professional tennis tour. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs turned pro after completing his sophomore season at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"He turned pro after the NCAAs (in June) and asked me to go out on the tour 
with him," Heffern said. "I wasn't really looking for something like this. He's 
the best I ever coached. He asked me to travel with him and help him. His 
father could pay my salary. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Heffern coached the boys' tennis team at Corona del Mar for 10 seasons, winning 
the Southern Section 4-A championship in 1983. He also coached the girls' team 
for the past seven years. The team won the 4-A title and Keri Phebus won the 
Southern Section singles title last fall. 
</P>
<P>
He also coached the girls' basketball team for four seasons in the early 1980s, 
winning the 3-A title in 1983. And for the past four seasons, he was an 
assistant on the boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Heffern and Briggs recently returned from a tournament in the Azores, a group 
of islands off Portugal. Briggs is trying to compile enough Assn. of Tennis 
Professionals points on satellite tournaments to qualify for main events such 
as the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
He earned 27 points in the Azores. "It's a good start," Heffern said. "I hope 
things turn out well."

WHO'S WHO?;

<P>
MEET THE NEW BAND, NOT THE SAME BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene before the Who stepped on stage Tuesday night at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium looked grim for anyone who has ever cared about the legendary 
British rock group. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime Who fans, in fact, have been anxious since hearing the news that 
the three surviving members of the band -- guitarist Pete Townshend, singer 
Roger Daltrey and bassist John Entwistle -- were going on the road again. 
</P>
<P>
This return -- seven years after a highly successful "farewell" tour -- 
conjured up visions of a veteran prizefighter who, driven by either ego or 
money, just can't call it quits. So he ends up stepping into the ring one time 
too many and gets humiliated by the lightning jabs of a younger and stronger 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
In the Who's case, there was no chance these musicians, all in their mid-40s, 
would be upstaged by some young rock 'n' roll hotshots, because there is no 
support act on the tour, which includes stops tonight at the Universal 
Amphitheatre and Saturday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But the group's performances would invariably be weighed against the greatness 
of the band's shows back in its prime, when the Who was rivaled as a creative 
force in Britain only by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Could the Who -- 
now celebrating its 25th anniversary -- still stand tall against that memory? 
</P>
<P>
The outlook wasn't good at the start of the evening because of all the 
commercialism surrounding the show. 
</P>
<P>
First, huge banners advertising the tour-sponsoring beer covered the banks of 
speakers on both sides of the stage. Then, disc jockeys from radio station 91-X 
(XTRA-FM) came on stage to welcome the more than 40,000 fans, plugging the 
station six times in three sentences. 
</P>
<P>
While the jocks were promoting the station, an airplane was circling the 
stadium pulling a banner that reminded the audience that the Who's gala, 
benefit performance of the rock opera "Tommy" tonight at the Universal 
Amphitheatre would be carried live, on a pay-per-view basis, on cable TV. 
Implored the banner: "Order now." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Townshend would have broken a guitar over the head of 
anyone who tried to capitalize on the band in such a manner. 
</P>
<P>
By allowing the hucksterism, the band -- which fell at least 10,000 seats short 
of a sellout -- seemed severed from its own proud and independent heritage. 
Would its music be just as compromised? 
</P>
<P>
But this tour deliberately sidesteps direct comparisons with the original Who. 
That's why there should be an asterisk by the band's name this time around, to 
distinguish it from the true Who. Instead of the creative glow and spontaneous 
fury of the days when it was a quartet and still included the late Keith Moon 
on drums, this edition of the Who* featured drummer Simon Phillips and was 
augmented by 11 other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
This lineup -- a five-piece horn section, three backup singers, a keyboardist, 
a percussionist and a second electric guitarist -- resulted in a more 
deliberate and polished presentation. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, notably key moments in the half-hour mini-version of "Tommy" 
that opened the three-hour concert, the added musicians enriched the songs, 
adding to their majesty. Elsewhere, however, the added trappings seemed 
overblown, sometimes flattening the music's emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was an inspiring sense of determination and pride as the Who* took 
the stage at 7:30 p.m. and the beer banners were suddenly pulled down and 
replaced by Who banners sporting a colorful series of pinball images. 
</P>
<P>
Townshend skipped about the stage with the joy of a man doing what he loves, 
and he set down the acoustic guitar at several points to play electric guitar 
with the fury and bite of old. 
</P>
<P>
That same pride and craft were evident in the performances of Daltrey and 
Entwistle, and the added musicians, too, seemed well drilled. 
</P>
<P>
For all the spirit of the musicians, however, the real triumph of the concert 
rested in the continuing power of the Who's songs. Pop music performers over 40 
are often equated with nostalgia. That's because most pop songs are so flimsy 
that the only emotions they provoke after a few years is the memory of what you 
were doing when you first heard them. 
</P>
<P>
But the best rock songs -- including the introspective works of Bob Dylan, Neil 
Young, John Fogerty and Townshend -- continue to offer listeners, young and 
old, new insights and stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
Both Townshend's short works -- from "The Kids Are Alright" to "Won't Get 
Fooled Again" -- and the longer "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia" express the 
frustrations and desires of youth, and are every bit as artful and illuminating 
in their way as books by Salinger or Kerouac. That restlessness and fury still 
echo in the Who's records and in parts of the new Who* tour. 
</P>
<P>
After "Tommy," the spiritually accented story of a young boy who tries to find 
comfort and meaning in a world where human cruelty contributed to an incident 
in which he was struck "deaf, dumb and blind," the band moved through a 
predictable set of Who favorites, ending with a playfully nostalgic version of 
the Isley Brothers' old "Twist and Shout." 
</P>
<P>
The audience was dominated by fans in their late teens and early 20s who were 
seeing the band for the first time, but was also sprinkled heavily with older 
Who fans coming back for, perhaps, a final look. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured this was the last chance I'd ever have to see them," said a 
17-year-old high school student from El Cajon. A 39-year-old banking executive 
added, "This isn't the band that I used to love, but the music still stands up 
and I wanted to say goodby. Besides, none of us is the same as we were 20 years 
ago. I remember hitchhiking 100 miles to see the Who the first time. Tonight, I 
drove here in my Mercedes." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. There's no way this Who* tour is as stirring as the old Who shows, 
but there's never a substitute for the tension surrounding a band at its 
creative peak. Still, it's hard not to be touched by the continuing competitive 
spirit and desire of these musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply honor the band's own history with these shows, the three 
surviving members seem to be saluting the intense relationship that existed 
between the Who and its fans -- and, at the same time, paying tribute to an era 
in rock. After a quarter-century, Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle are far from 
kids, but they're still all right.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: GERMAN AGENTS COULDN'T SABOTAGE VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vandals who overran Rome with spears and swords 1,500 years ago may have 
had an easier time of it than the punk-rock Vandals who campaigned across 
Europe this summer with guitars and amps. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a traumatic blowup with the tour's West German booking agents, the 
three-month, 56-concert trip was worth the trouble, Vandals leader Joe 
Escalante said after returning last week (the group plays a homecoming show 
Saturday at Night Moves in Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
"An eye-opening trip of a lifetime," Escalante said. "All of us feel that way. 
But our next one won't be that long. I can't go that long without Taco Bell." 
</P>
<P>
The satirically inclined band, which originated nine years ago in Huntington 
Beach, was accompanied for most of its 11-nation tour by Mind Over 4, an Orange 
County punk-metal group. 
</P>
<P>
Inexperience on the part of the tour's American coordinator led to logistical 
problems, according to Escalante. Worse, he said, was the attitude of the West 
German agents who handled bookings and financial arrangements -- and took to 
hurling racial epithets at Escalante when he started to insist on a firmer hand 
in managing the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The German company said, 'We can't have this Mexican kid running the whole 
thing. No little Mexican is going to tell us what to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Escalante said, when he complained about a bounced check, one of 
the German promoters pulled a gun on him. From then on, the Vandals and Mind 
Over 4 severed ties with the company and made their own business arrangements 
to complete the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Things never got so bad that we didn't want to be there," Escalante said. "By 
the time you got to the show, it was packed, and there were Vandals fans, and 
it was the place you wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
The Vandals and Mind Over 4 played clubs holding 200 to 800 fans. Escalante 
said that in Germany, especially, it was common to find fans of such other 
Orange County punk rock groups as T.S.O.L., the Adolescents and D.I. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these bands could go there and do well," Escalante said. "People are 
over there making bootleg D.I. shirts." 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the Vandals played to about 100 fans in a church. Because the 
Communist authorities don't sanction punk rock shows, Escalante said, the 
concert took place surreptitiously, with the Americans following hand-drawn 
maps to get to the gig undetected. The Vandals marked the occasion by playing 
D.I.'s Iron Curtain surf fantasy, "Hang Ten in East Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
The Vandals is an irreverent, good-time band that levels topical barbs and 
social lampoons in scattershot fashion, mainly for the fun of it. But they 
found that European punk fans tend to take politics more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, you're brought up to see there's a chance for you, even if you're 
not one of the 'haves,' " Escalante said. "You think you're going to be the 
next 'have.' In Europe, they don't have that chance. There's no upward 
mobility, so they're real critical of the 'haves.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Vandals tried to keep their own conservative political leanings to 
themselves (in 1984, the band supported Ronald Reagan for President and played 
at least one benefit show for a Young Republicans group). In Amsterdam, 
Escalante said, the Vandals were confronted by a group of taunters who, among 
other things, belabored them for having backed Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, "everyone was willing to put the politics aside and 
have fun." 
</P>
<P>
For Mind Over 4, the tour was less a frolic than an endurance test. 
</P>
<P>
The band's first European album was supposed to be released on a German label 
before the tour began, but singer Spike Xavier said a package containing the 
master tapes disappeared in transit and the record never came out, putting a 
crimp in the band's ability to attract fans of its own. 
</P>
<P>
In Holland on the third day of the tour, Xavier fractured his ankle during a 
performance when he slipped on a beer slick and fell from a high stage. Rather 
than have surgery, which would have forced Mind Over 4 to give up the tour, 
Xavier spent five days keeping the leg immobilized, then hobbled on, performing 
the remaining shows in a cast. Xavier said he also missed the East Berlin date 
because of an error in the map he had been given to find the clandestine hall 
where the gig took place. Strapped for money, Mind Over 4 spent the tour 
sleeping in a van or finding shelter in warehouses and abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the 'Life Styles of the Poor and Unknown,' " Xavier joked over the 
phone from his home in Whittier. "We pulled into L.A. with $1 and a quarter 
tank of gas." But after much American touring over the past year, Xavier thinks 
Mind Over 4's European travels succeeded in establishing a new market there for 
the band. "We felt we made a major accomplishment under just the worst physical 
conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Destiny Records, a West German label, will release a new Mind Over 4 record in 
Europe and the United States this fall. The band is also about to record an 
album for Powerhouse Records, a Huntington Beach-based label. 
</P>
<P>
The Vandals and Voo Doo Dolls play Saturday at Night Moves, 5902 Warner Ave. in 
Huntington Beach. Tickets: $8. Information: (714) 840-6118.

LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE PROVIDES TRAINING FOR MOVIE AND TV ROLES IN SESSIONS 
CO-SPONSORED BY COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Audiences didn't see young Scott Warneke in "Gorillas in the Mist." His small 
role in the movie ended up on the cutting room floor. But that's OK with Scott. 
The red-haired, freckle-faced 11-year-old from Dana Point got to fly to England 
with his mother for filming, met actress Sigourney Weaver and toured some real 
live castles. And he got an edited version of his cut scenes for his burgeoning 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual part of the story is that Scott, who played a young man with severe 
rheumatoid arthritis, suffers from the debilitating disease himself. Often, 
Scott said, casting agents call on non-disabled actors to portray disabled 
characters in films and on TV. The agents say there is a lack of trained young 
disabled actors, according to Jody Davidson, general manager of the Laguna 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It's a situation that Davidson is hoping to change. The playhouse is in the 
midst of an intensive weeklong acting workshop for disabled budding actors, 7 
to 18 years old. The 45 participants represent a wide range of physical and 
learning disabilities, including cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, blindness, 
deafness, orthopedic disabilities, autism and spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the first day of the workshop, the youngsters broke up into three 
groups and rotated among three teachers. In a dressing room, Davidson led a 
session on memorization. Youngsters paired off and made up a conversation, then 
performed it for the class -- twice. The point was to match the two renditions 
word for word. 
</P>
<P>
The students, some with the aid of sign language, discussed such subjects as 
favorite hobbies, pets and the relative merits of Debbie Gibson and Michael 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In the theater's green room, Joe Lauderdale acquainted his students with the 
essentials of pantomime and improvisation. Members of the older group often 
broke into nervous laughter as they passed an imaginary ball around. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the group progressed to an imaginary "magic bag." Each student pulled 
out a mimed "object" (they ranged from a guitar to a radio to a video game); 
the others tried to guess what it was. In the lobby, Scott Davidson, Jody's 
husband, taught some essentials of movement and "body awareness." Students 
stretched out on the floor and tensed different parts of their bodies, on cue. 
</P>
<P>
After this week's sessions, 30 of the youngsters will be chosen for a yearlong 
program that will meet twice a week for 30 weeks, then five days a week for a 
month. The program will conclude with a showcase production in Hollywood for 
agents and others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
In narrowing the group to 30, Jody Davidson said she and other teachers are 
looking chiefly for desire: "If desire is there, everything else can be 
taught." 
</P>
<P>
They're also looking for "how much (the students) use the things they have." 
</P>
<P>
If the actors are asked to sneak across the stage, the direction applies 
equally to those in wheelchairs. "I want that chair to sneak across the stage," 
Jody said. "I want to see 'sneak' written on their faces." 
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored with the Orange County Department of Education, both the one-week 
and yearlong programs are free to participants. This week's sessions were 
underwritten by the Laguna Beach Festival of the Arts, while the longer program 
will be paid for with a $16,000 grant from the California Community Foundation 
and pending grants from two other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Before she came to Laguna, Jody Davidson led the Rainbow Company in Las Vegas, 
which she said was the first integrated disabled/non-disabled children's 
theater company in the country. At Laguna, she has worked with the Youth 
Theater program, which has mounted several productions featuring disabled 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of her background, casting agents in search of young disabled 
actors call her "two or three times a month," she said. "They'll say, 'Do you 
have a blind 10-year-old boy,' or, 'Do you have a deaf 16-year-old girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are not enough trained actors to fill the requests, so roles are often 
cast with non-disabled actors or rewritten. "We want to provide that training," 
Davidson said. The focus of the program, Davidson emphasized, is occupational 
and not therapeutic. She wants the students to see acting "as a potential way 
to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Arletta Proche is an agent who represents several young disabled actors, 
including Scott Warneke and Jade Calegory, a Dana Point youth who starred in 
last year's feature film "Mac and Me" and who must get around in a wheelchair. 
She has used Davidson as a contact since Davidson's days at the Rainbow 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
Proche agreed that there is a need for more young disabled actors but noted 
that obstacles exist beyond the lack of training. Some producers, she said, are 
concerned that a set, with its many cables and moving cameras and other 
hazards, may be a dangerous setting for a disabled youngster. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, there are casting directors who go out of their way to hire 
disabled actors. She singled out Marvin Page of the daytime soap opera "General 
Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for (young disabled actors), I'll tell you that, but I think it 
will get better," Proche said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hayes, 16, a student at Fountain Valley High School who uses a 
wheelchair, relayed his growing enthusiasm for acting during a break in 
Monday's classes: "It's fun. It's just lately that I've really gotten into it 
and said, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
His face brightened when he was asked if he would like to move into movies or 
TV. "I'd love to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Warneke, at 11 a veteran of commercials and TV roles, was enthusiastic about 
this chance to further his training, and especially to perform before Hollywood 
casting agents. "This is a really, really neat opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Davidson, meanwhile, is looking forward to the challenge of the coming 
year. "The yearlong is a really intensive program," she said. "By the end of it 
we should have some damn good young actors."

A SPECIAL DIMENSION TO 'BEING A GOOD SPORT'

At cocktail hour, you couldn't tell the press from the guests. 
</P>
<P>
Up and down a hallway in the Newport Beach Marriott, cameras clicked and 
flashed, questions flew, pen-and-paper wielders shouldered along distractedly. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the frenzy was L.A. Lakers star Byron Scott, whose annual 
"Challenge for Children" fund-raising weekend culminated Saturday with a 
black-tie dinner and auction. The event drew 500 guests at $100 each and 
provided the autograph-and-photo hounds among them access to a smorgasbord of 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Gracing the hotel hallway before dinner were basketball biggies Mark Eaton and 
Darrell Griffith of the Utah Jazz, who along with a couple of dozen other pros 
played in Scott's benefit game Friday night at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, middleweight boxing champion Michael Nunn, who coached the winning team 
on Friday, kidded his manager (and losing coach) Daniel Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right, we won!" chanted Nunn, whose broad smile and handsome, unmarked 
features look more like those of a model than a fighter. When Goossen scowled, 
Nunn grew even more animated. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how it is when they lose," he said. " 'My stomach hurts! My feet 
hurt! It wasn't fair!' " Delivered with a laugh by a man whose line of work 
leaves no room for excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Mingling outside the silent auction room was forever-suave Richard Roundtree 
(a.k.a. "Shaft"), who participated in a celebrity tennis tournament earlier in 
the day, also a part of the fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three children, and I love kids," said Roundtree, who attended the 
dinner with his wife, Karen. "Anything for kids I'm totally in support of. 
Plus, I'm a big Lakers fan." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Andrew Stevens made a Hollywood-style entrance with a blonde on one arm 
and a brunette on the other. Stevens played in the celebrity golf tournament 
held at the Costa Mesa Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Television's Alan Thicke brought date Kristy Swanson but declined to be 
photographed with her because of what he called "dating paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
"If you take that picture, then the rumors get started and the tabloids grab it 
and go crazy. . . . " Et cetera, et cetera: The world of fame, according to 
Thicke. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend-long benefit raised $80,000, which will be divided among Childrens 
Hospital of Orange County; South County Community Clinic in San Juan 
Capistrano; Samaritan Medical Center in San Clemente, and the Byron Scott 
Children's Fund Ltd.

ANN CONWAY: KIROV SHOWS DANCERS ARE GOOD COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Yah vas loo-bloo! " Igor Stupnikov, a professor at Leningrad University, was 
teaching Kathryn Thompson Owen how to say "I love you" in Russian (Ya vas 
lyublyu). 
</P>
<P>
"Yah vas loo-bloo!" she repeated, giggling. "Yah vas loo-bloo!" 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, it was love, not the Waterford chandeliers, that lit up the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
After performing "The Sleeping Beauty" for a matinee at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, members of the Kirov Ballet had bused it down to the 
Ritz for an evening barbecue with Center board members and major donors. 
</P>
<P>
When the troupe filed onto a seaside patio to join guests such as Center board 
Chairman Henry Segerstrom, his wife, Renee, and Center President Thomas 
Kendrick and his wife, Judy Morr, they were quiet and rather shy. They had, 
after all, come upon a party scene that had been happening for a solid hour. 
Guests, gussied down in invitation-prescribed California casual wear, arrived 
at 6 p.m.; the troupe, at 7. 
</P>
<P>
But before you could say "Tchaikovsky," the dancers began to turn on their love 
lights: some sat at the chic cocktail tables and flashed heart-stopping smiles; 
some danced -- so gracefully -- with guests to the Ruff Riders bluegrass band 
(guest Michael Gilano was in a full state of blush after an oh-so-slow dance 
with prima ballerina Tatyana Terekhova). Some, like Stupnikov, actually said, 
"Ya vas lyublyu." 
</P>
<P>
And some said it in other ways. "I am glad to see you -- your country, your 
California," said Oleg Vinogradov, the Kirov's dashing artistic director and 
chief choreographer (who later donned a cowboy hat and crooned "Tom Dooley" in 
deliciously broken English). "And glad to see that you are all happy for me, 
for my company! Thank you very much." 
</P>
<P>
After a twilight cocktail hour or two, guests settled down to devour what had 
to be one of the most divine buffets this side of the repast served up at 
Malcolm Forbes' recent tango in Tangier: an array of fresh fruit fanned on 
silver trays the size of Boogie boards, barbecued lamb chops (cooked up on 
sizzling open grills with coals the size of beach balls), crab tacos with big 
leaf cactus (the hands-down fave of hamburger mogul Carl Karcher), salads 
drizzled with champagne lime dressing, and desserts that kept guests saying 
"Encore! Encore!" -- wickedly yummy chocolate-chip cookies, apple tarts and 
sludge-thick fudge and butterscotch sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kirov represents the quality and stature that the Center has come to 
represent," said Center board member and the hostess of the gala, Kathryn 
Thompson Owen, officially opening the festivities. (Owen, the newlywed wife of 
developer Gus Owen, wowed the crowd in her cropped blue denim jacket. Its 
swaying fringe dripped with iridescent bugle beads and crystals.) 
</P>
<P>
Stupnikov told guests that Kirov "was a great politician and friend, killed by 
Stalin in 1934." 
</P>
<P>
"The company is 206 years old," he continued. "A little behind with France, but 
with the U.S.A., grandmothers and grandfathers in ballet. The Kirov produced 
Pavlova, Nijinsky, Balanchine. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And of the dancers who portrayed "Sleeping Beauty," Stupnikov said: "All of our 
dancers are young wine . . . our Auroras very young and beautiful, our princes 
still kicking! It is the task of beauty to save the world -- that is what the 
Kirov is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, choking up, he concluded: "As Dostoevsky said, 'Beauty will save the 
world.' " 
</P>
<P>
Faces in the crowd: Gus Owen (asking the Ruff Riders to play "May I Have This 
Dance for the Rest of My Life?" for his new bride); Dr. Walter Henry with Maria 
Carmen del Calvo; Jill and Joe Thomas (sporting a platinum 1844 Russian coin 
around his neck); Jim and Judy Beard (chic in chamois skirt and vest); Maria 
Crutcher; Lillian Fluor; Bobbitt Williams; Sandra Clouse; Jeanne and David 
Tappan; Maurice and Marcy Mulville; Tom and Marilyn Nielsen; Julia and Irving 
Rappaport; John Rau; Diane and Harry Rinker; Sheila Prell Sonenshine with her 
daughter, Mandy; Billur Wallerich (fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue in 
Costa Mesa); Joanne Sokolski; Dotti and Glenn Stillwell, and Joyce and Tom 
Tucker.

ASK THE VET: MALE CAT'S SPRAYING MAY INDICATE PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. We have three cats in our household, two females and one male. In the past 
three weeks, our male cat has started to urinate in various places in the 
house. He is 2 1/2 years old and is neutered. He seems to be healthy and eats 
well. We are becoming concerned that he may have a bladder problem that we 
heard is common to male cats. All three cats are indoors and eat the same food. 
Does this sound like a bladder infection? Is there anything that we can do at 
home? 
</P>
<P>
Gladys Powell, Brea 
</P>
<P>
A. When a cat starts to urinate outside of the litter box, there may be several 
reasons. If there is only one litter box, he may be objecting to sharing the 
box with the other two cats or it may be an indication that the box is not 
being kept clean enough for him. You may have to get an extra litter box or 
keep the current box very clean. 
</P>
<P>
Your male cat may also be starting to exert his dominance by marking his 
territory -- in this case, the house -- by spraying in various locations. Even 
though he is neutered, he may still spray to show that he is the No. 1 cat in 
the house. This is a behavioral situation that may require medications from 
your veterinarian to help change. 
</P>
<P>
If your cat is straining to urinate or can't seem to hold his urine long enough 
to make it to the litter box, he may in fact be developing a urinary problem. 
It would be wise to have him checked by your veterinarian and a urinalysis done 
to rule out the possibility of an infection or cystitis. Your vet may want to 
start him on antibiotics or special diets to keep the infection under control. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My 6-year-old female cocker is starting to cough, especially when she gets 
very active. She doesn't seem to be uncomfortable otherwise and eats well. I 
have not seen her vomit or cough anything up. I have kept her vaccinations up 
to date and her vet said she was healthy on her last exam. Could she have 
developed kennel cough? She has played with other dogs at the park where we run 
but I haven't heard any of them cough. Should I have her checked again? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Eisenmann, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A. Since coughing is a non-specific sign of so many disorders, I would 
recommend that you have your dog examined again. There are so many 
possibilities -- from having a tracheal irritation from a foreign body, such as 
grass, to the beginning signs of heart disease. Your veterinarian will want to 
examine her thoroughly. A chest X-ray will probably be necessary. In the 
meantime, I would reduce or eliminate her running exercises.

LIFE ON WHEELS: VIEW OF FREEWAY TRAFFIC FROM A PETERBILT PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 5:30 a.m. Monday. Ken Bowling's Garden Grove neighborhood is quiet and 
dark as he starts the family van and heads for work. 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of early to be getting on the road, isn't it?" he notes. I nod and mutter 
something affirmative, stifling a yawn. Bowling has invited me along today to 
get a look at Orange County's roads from a different perspective: the cab of 
his 1978 Peterbilt truck, with a 42-foot trailer behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, you'd get up at 4 or 5 in the morning, and truckers were the only 
ones out here," Bowling says. "But now there's traffic nearly 24 hours a day." 
The surface streets are mostly quiet at this hour, but the freeways are already 
getting busy. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks from home, he stops by a doughnut shop for the usual: a foam cup 
of coffee. By the time he pulls his van up to his tractor-trailer rig, parked 
on an industrial back street in Artesia, the cup is empty. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling parks his four-wheeler and starts up the Peterbilt's diesel. As it 
warms up, he circles the rig, inspecting lights, 18 wheels and tires, making 
sure that the load of lumber he picked up Friday afternoon at Los Angeles 
Harbor in San Pedro is still securely tied down. 
</P>
<P>
Then he opens the door to the cab and climbs up into his customized seat, with 
its special lumbar support and spring suspension to cushion the shock of the 
road. He looks over all the dials and gauges and switches -- I've seen simpler 
airplane cockpits -- and eases it into gear. 
</P>
<P>
At the traffic light at the end of the street, I get my first lesson in how 
trucks deal with cars. We're turning right; the cars from the opposite 
direction are lined up to turn left. Bowling has the right of way, but he waits 
to let the other drivers go first. They would just be frustrated if they had to 
wait for his slow turn, he says, so it's better to let them go ahead than worry 
that one of them might dart prematurely into the intersection before the 
trailer clears it. 
</P>
<P>
As we merge onto the eastbound Riverside Freeway, I see instantly why Bowling 
needs that special seat. I feel as if I'm riding a jackhammer. Bowling 
apologizes. "It'll settle down some when we get past this stretch," he says. 
"Concrete isn't very flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, when we get past the concrete and onto asphalt, the battering 
subsides -- a little. 
</P>
<P>
We're headed for Mission Viejo, where the lumber will be used to build new 
$400,000-plus houses on a recently bulldozed hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a boy, Bowling was fascinated with how things got from here to there, 
on trucks, boats, airplanes, trains. His grandfather was a truck driver. 
Bowling says he chose that profession because "I like to be on the move all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
But now, after nearly 25 years, he is looking for a new line of work. "It's 
just too frustrating now," he says. He must share the road not only with an 
ever-increasing number of cars, but with more and more trucks as well. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trucking industry was deregulated under the Reagan Administration, 
Bowling says: "You were certified to haul one thing, and that's what you 
hauled. But now every Tom, Dick and Harry can haul anything they want." 
</P>
<P>
With increased competition, some drivers try to undercut the others by hauling 
loads for less. "It's no wonder those guys are out here rushing around like 
crazy," he says. "That's the only way they can hope to make money." 
</P>
<P>
On our left, another tractor-trailer rig is passing, with his right turn signal 
on. Bowling reaches over to flick his lights on and off, a traditional trucking 
courtesy gesture to let the other driver know he's clear to merge in front. But 
the other driver does not acknowledge the signal. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody used to do stuff like that," Bowling says. "I still do; for me it's 
just part of the tradition. But I don't get many responses anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Other trucking traditions have changed as well. "Years ago, if a truck was 
stopped on the side of the road, other truckers would stop to help out. Now 
they just keep on going," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling calls my attention to the side rear-view mirrors. "See that guy back 
there? He's right on top of me. I would never do that with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
"This rig weighs up to 80,000 pounds, loaded," Bowling says. "You have to 
respect that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in front of us, cars are constantly cutting in. Bowling says he 
tries to leave adequate space in front of him in case he has to stop suddenly, 
but it's a losing battle. Even if there is barely room for one car, the space 
won't stay empty for long. Instead of hitting his brakes, Bowling just keeps 
dropping back gradually. 
</P>
<P>
As the road gets more congested with going-to-work traffic, he moves carefully 
over into the center lane in a bid to avoid some merging cars. 
</P>
<P>
"People just panic at the idea of being behind a truck," he says. "They just 
have to get in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bowling's wife, Tracey, who volunteered him for this assignment with a 
letter to Life on Wheels. "I am very proud of what my husband does," she wrote. 
"Whenever I ride with him, I feel safe in the knowledge that he knows what he 
is doing, and I appreciate all the more the work he does and the aggravation he 
deals with every day." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Bowlings say the highways would be safer if car drivers better 
understood the inherent danger of trucks and gave them a wider berth. 
</P>
<P>
But truckers aren't all perfect, either. "Look at that!" Bowling says as we 
pass another truck, hauling cement pipe on an open trailer. "He hasn't tied 
that down very well on top." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are the 'stupid' truck drivers too, and we know a few of them," 
Tracey Bowling wrote in her letter. "I like to think that for every stupid 
passenger car driver, there is someone like myself who knows what to do around 
a moving truck, and for every unsafe truck driver, there is a good driver like 
Ken out there." 
</P>
<P>
We're going 55 m.p.h. on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway -- which means most 
everybody is passing us. But Bowling says he doesn't like to speed. "You've 
already got so much to watch out for, but if you're going 65, you've got a lot 
more to worry about. It just isn't worth it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling is an independent contractor, hauling regularly for a lumber 
distributor. Sometimes, he says, he gets instructions to hurry. "I just tell 
them I'm not going to break any laws or do anything that's unsafe. If they were 
in such a desperate hurry, they should have ordered the lumber earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling says he has never had a moving violation, although he was once cited 
for having an overweight load when the lumber he was hauling turned out to be 
greener and heavier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic has slowed to a crawl near the confluence of the Santa Ana and San 
Diego freeways. Bowling gasps as a motorcycle zips along between lanes and 
right into the space in front of us. "That kind of stuff really scares me," he 
says.

We exit at Oso Parkway, then head east toward the housing development. Behind 
us is another truck with an identical load; the driver is a friend of 
Bowling's, hauling for the same company. The two drivers chat on their CB 
radios as they drive. Neither has a "handle," and they use no CB jargon. 
"Nobody really does that these days," Bowling says. 
</P>
<P>
At the construction site, Bowling gets out, dons work gloves and unhooks the 
straps that hold down the load. A forklift is waiting to unload the truck. 
</P>
<P>
As the forklift works, he rolls up the straps and puts them neatly away. By the 
time the supervisor signs for the delivery, he is ready to go back to the 
harbor for another load. 
</P>
<P>
"I never know where they'll send me," he says. "Could be Ventura, or out in the 
desert, somewhere in L.A., or back here. So I never know when I'll be done for 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
It is past 8 a.m. now, and the northbound freeway is crowded and moving slow. 
Cars are cutting in four and five at a time now, and they seem more urgent than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why some people think they're so important that they have to get 
in front of everybody else," Bowling says. "It's like a contest. And some of 
them say, 'We don't want trucks on our freeways.' That really gets me. I pay 
more than $10,000 a year in road-use taxes. So who says it's their freeway? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we're all in this together. I just wish we could all work together 
to find some solutions, instead of taking it out on each other."

2 MORE NEPTUNE MOONS DISCOVERED AS VOYAGER NEARS 8:56 P.M. FLYBY

The Voyager 2 probe discovered two more moons around Neptune, pushing the 
ringed planet's total to eight as the probe raced toward its long-awaited 
late-night flyby of the "puzzling" blue planet, scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it! This is the 24 hours we've been waiting for," Voyager project 
scientist Edward Stone said at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
With Neptune filling the field of view in Voyager 2's cameras, a spectacular 
photograph was radioed back to Earth showing intricate detail of the Great Dark 
Spot, a titanic storm system topped by brilliant white cirrus clouds, a storm 
so large it could swallow the entire planet Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomer Bradford Smith announced that two more moons were discovered, one 
measuring just 30 miles or so across and another with a diameter of about 55 
miles. The moons have been temporarily dubbed 1989 N5 and 1989 N6. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Voyager 2 will streak 3,000 miles above Neptune's north polar 
cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. -- the closest the probe has been to a planet since 
launch from Earth 12 years and four days ago.

PROSECUTION RESTS CASE IN TRIAL OF ACCUSED VAN NUYS DRUG DEALER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors rested their case this morning in the drug-trafficking 
trial of a Honduran charged with operating a massive cocaine distribution 
network out of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer denied a defense motion to dismiss the case 
against Juan Ramon Matta, 44, after the prosecution completed its case in the 
trial that has lasted 15 days in the U.S. Courthouse downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Matta is accused of running a network that in a seven-month period moved more 
than a ton of cocaine into the United States. According to Matta's indictment, 
officials confiscated 114 pounds of the drug and $1.9 million in cash at a Van 
Nuys apartment on Sept. 21, 1981. At the time, it was the largest combined 
seizure of cocaine and cash in California history. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators used documents seized during the raid to lead them to 
Matta, who was known in the network as "El Negro," prosecutors said. The 
government's case also has relied on convicted drug dealer Hector Barona, who 
testified that he arranged the shipment of cocaine for Matta from Colombia to 
Florida and then to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Matta was arrested while aboard a U.S.-bound plane in April, 1988, after he was 
whisked out of Honduras and taken to the Dominican Republic by Honduran 
officials.

A U.S. magistrate today ordered that fugitive financier George Koskotas be 
extradited to Greece to face charges of embezzling more than $250 million from 
the Bank of Crete. 
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Joyce Alexander rejected Koskotas' arguments that he would face 
possible assassination if returned to his homeland and that the charges were 
political, a category of offense that is not extraditable under a U.S.-Greek 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Koskotas was arrested by FBI agents Nov. 23 as he arrived in a private jet at a 
suburban Boston airport from Brazil. He had fled there from Greece. Koskotas, 
35, is at the center of a financial scandal that brought down the government of 
former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in May.

France reduced its naval force heading toward Lebanon, and the warships 
appeared to slow their advance today as they cruised less than 200 miles from 
the Lebanese coast, far out of range of hostile Syrian and Muslim militia 
artillery. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-backed Muslim forces have threatened to fire on the French ships and 
to stage retaliatory attacks inside France if the naval force intervenes to 
help Christian forces in Lebanon's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the eight-ship 
French fleet was reduced to six ships, leaving the aircraft carrier Foch, two 
oil tankers, two frigates and a landing ship off the coast of Lebanon. 
Government sources said only five ships are still headed for Lebanon.

A black teen-ager was shot to death in an attack by a gang of young whites 
carrying baseball bats and seeking revenge for a friend whose girlfriend 
spurned him to date blacks and Latinos, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef Hawkins, 16, was fatally shot during the confrontation Wednesday night 
with a gang of whites waiting outside an apartment where a party for the young 
woman's 18th birthday was under way, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang apparently mistook Hawkins and three other blacks for the woman's new 
male friends, police said. The four black youths had gone to the predominantly 
white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to buy a used car. 
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating the killing of Hawkins as a racially motivated 
incident. Witnesses heard some of the whites, identified as neighborhood 
youths, utter racial epithets, Commissioner Benjamin Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The white gang, referring to the youths, shouted, "Is this the -- -- 
boyfriend?" Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Alice McGillion said. 
</P>
<P>
The 9:30 p.m. attack began when some of the whites, waiting outside the party, 
followed Hawkins and the black teen-agers after they walked past the group and 
turned onto a nearby avenue, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"The former boyfriend and a group of his friends waited outside the apartment 
for the girl's new friends to arrive," Ward said. "The four black youths, on 
their way to buy the used car which had been advertised, unknowingly walked 
into the white group." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins was shot twice in the chest during the attack in which he and his 
friends were surrounded by as many as 30 bat-wielding white youths about a 
block away from the party, Ward said. A total of four shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins died later at Maimonides Medical Center.

A majority of Americans are ready for "tradition-shattering" educational reform 
and would support higher taxes for schools as well as an array of changes such 
as a national curriculum and the doctrine of choice favored by President Bush, 
a poll showed today. 
</P>
<P>
The 21st annual Gallup-Phi Delta Kappa poll of attitudes on public education 
also found Americans still consider drug use to be the major problem facing 
their local schools, continuing a trend that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion of Americans giving their local schools a grade of A or B rose 
to 43%, up from 40% last year and a low of 31% in 1983. Four percent said their 
local schools deserved an F, the same as the last two years.

Customers who bought Eastern Airlines tickets and were unable to use them 
because of the strike have until Aug. 31 to file claims with the court involved 
in Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings, the Department of Transportation said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The department said it was issuing a consumer advisory because it believed that 
many ticket-holders might not have heard about the deadline. Eastern and the 
bankruptcy court initially advised passengers not to file claims until a 
procedure was established, the advisory said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 21, Eastern filed a plan calling for full refunds in cash, with 
interest, to people holding unused tickets purchased before March 9. The court 
involved is the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.

In the first major consolidation since the $14-billion merger of Time Inc. and 
Warner Communications Inc., Time Warner Inc. said today it is forming a unit 
comprising Little, Brown and Co. and Warner Books. 
</P>
<P>
Annual publishing revenues for the combined entity, to be called Time Warner 
Trade Publishing and operated by Time Inc. Book Co., should exceed $160 
million, the company said. Both houses are to continue publishing with separate 
imprints. 
</P>
<P>
Little, Brown is a 152-year-old hard-cover and professional publishing house, 
which was controlled by Time, and Warner Books was Warner Communications' 
mass-market paperback and hard-cover publishing unit. 
</P>
<P>
The move was planned by the companies when the merger agreement was formed. 
"Right from the start we said that Warner Books would become part of the Time 
Inc. book operations," said Louis Slovinsky, a Time Warner spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of the new unit "enables the Time Inc. Book Co. to expand its 
consumer-targeted publishing efforts and to do hard (and) soft trade-book 
deals, said Kelso Sutton, president and chairman of Time Warner's book 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Inc., formerly Time Inc., bought 59.3% of Warner Communications 
last month for $7 billion cash and has proposed to buy the remaining 
outstanding Warner Communications stock with a package of securities valued at 
$70 a share.

Thomas T. Demery lobbied to be appointed secretary of housing and urban 
development while knowing he was under investigation for allegedly mishandling 
a federal housing program, records released today show. 
</P>
<P>
As assistant secretary for housing at HUD for two years, "I have become greatly 
challenged and sensitized to the public policy questions surrounding the 
homeless, the availability of low-income housing, and the difficulty the 
elderly and first-time home buyers face in finding affordable housing," Demery 
said in a form letter to congressmen dated Dec. 7, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The position went to former Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), and Demery has gone into 
private consulting. But Demery's conduct at HUD is being examined as part of 
the investigation of alleged fraud, abuse and mismanagement at the agency 
during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to Sens. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), Donald W. Riegle 
(D-Mich.), Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Rep. Carl D. Pursell (R-Mich.) and Robert 
Teeter, then co-director of the office of President-elect Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were contained in files opened to the press today under the Freedom 
of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Demery could not immediately be reached. A woman answering his telephone said 
Demery is on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Demery is a former Michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker who worked in 
Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign. As assistant housing secretary, he 
administered several of HUD's biggest programs, including $225 million in 
moderate-rehabilitation funds awarded annually and the massive Federal Housing 
Administration's mortgage insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Peddling Revealed 
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation program has been revealed to have been governed by influence 
peddling while the FHA lost millions of dollars annually through loan defaults 
and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, HUD's inspector general was investigating in 1988 whether Demery 
had misused his position to induce contractors seeking HUD business to 
contribute to his pet charity, F.O.O.D. for Africa. The inspector general 
concluded that Demery may have traded on his position, but last month the 
Justice Department said it saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's investigation began early in 1988, and by autumn it was 
apparent that Demery was among its targets.

The Ohio State Racing Commission has suspended five Northfield Park harness 
racing trainers for a one-year period beginning Sept. 8 after their horses 
tested positive for prohibited drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, meeting Wednesday at the track, suspended driver-trainers Mark 
Gorfido, Bill Popio, Craig Stein and brothers Jerry and Tom Randall. 
</P>

Top track and field officials had proof several months before the 1988 Olympics 
that Canadian athletes were taking steroids, but did nothing, a federal inquiry 
on drugs in amateur sports was told today. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Findlay, a staff member of the Canadian Track and Field Assn., testified 
he told association President Wilf Wedman in February, 1988, that he had proof 
of steroid use among the country's top sprinters. His evidence was based on a 
statement by decathlete Dave Steen that he had been offered steroids by Ben 
Johnson's doctor, Jamie Astaphan. Findlay testified Steen also told him that 
Astaphan admitted he was injecting sprinter Angela Issajenko with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
But Wedman, who left the association in early 1988, said the evidence was not 
enough and refused to even acknowledge the growing problem of drugs in amateur 
sport, Findlay said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedman is scheduled to take the witness stand next month.
