WHAT MANNER OF MAN IS THIS?;

<P>
HUSSEIN'S FORCED TV SHOW WITH HIS 'GUESTS' WON'T HELP THE CAUSE OF PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made an unexpected television appearance 
Thursday that may make a peaceful resolution of the military buildup in the 
Persian Gulf even more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities released videotape of a forced meeting between Saddam Hussein 
and a group of obviously uncomfortable Western hostages. No doubt the Iraqi 
president's aim in staging this unprecedented media event was to appear to 
Arabs as a reasonable man who wishes only to move back from war and who is 
deeply concerned about the hostages as human beings. He also wants to impress 
on the United States and the West that a full-scale air attack on key Iraqi 
installations will cause fearsome casualties among the thousands of Americans 
and other foreigners being held at many, if not all, of those installations in 
Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Governments in the West reacted to the appalling footage with predictable but 
nonetheless sincere and justifiable outrage. No one watching the videotape 
could fail to be moved by the thoroughly helpless plight of the men, women and 
children forced to be in that room with the Iraqi dictator. At one point in 
this bizarre and reprehensible performance, the camera moved its lens to a 
teen-age boy but quickly shifted away as tears welled up in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It risks tarnishing the point to suggest that the Iraqi president will require 
better advice on how to use mass media if he is to project a more positive 
image in the days and weeks ahead. A repeat of a performance like Thursday's 
will probably only serve to inflame Western opinion all the more against him. 
</P>
<P>
It was irritating to hear yet again that the Iraqi president regards these 
people, so trapped in the winds of war, not as hostages but as "guests." This 
cockeyed version of hospitality is insufferably infuriating, and it doesn't get 
more palatable with repetition. There can be no further evidence, if any were 
needed, that the Iraqis are enveloped in a war psychosis that is devoid of all 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
This is a dangerous business. It is always better for peace to prevail over 
war. If there is a diplomatic way out, that is the preferable route to take. 
But every day that option seems less likely, less realistic, more remote.

MARION BARRY'S TRIAL AND BLACK LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times, after self-righteously proclaiming that "all Americans must be held 
equally accountable," and noting "this nation's sad history of disparate legal 
treatment of blacks and whites," nonetheless calls for "maximum sentence -- a 
$100,000 fine and a year in jail," notwithstanding that "first offenders rarely 
do jail time on misdemeanor convictions." 
</P>
<P>
When The Times states that many "black Americans openly doubt the government 
would have gone to such great lengths to pursue a powerful white man," thus 
precluding the notion that any non-black Americans might share this notion, the 
inevitable conclusion is that "his (Mayor Barry's) remaining admirers," to whom 
"the maximum penalty would send a strong warning," are also black. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently some Americans are more equally accountable than others.

<P>
As an immigrant from Cambodia, I would like to comment on the column "Only a 
Speedy Alliance Can Stop the Butchers" (by Jeremy Stone, Commentary, Aug. 1). 
</P>
<P>
I think it is a great mistake for Stone, the U.S. government and some U.S. 
senators and representatives to think that the Hun Sen government, which was 
installed by Vietnam in 1980, is the best hope for Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 18th Century, Vietnam has wanted to annex Cambodia. Ho Chi Minh 
talked about Cambodia in an Indochina under Vietnamese Communist Party control. 
We Cambodians do not like the Khmer Rouge killings, but we like even less being 
absorbed by Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The best hope for Cambodia is a government elected by all factions representing 
real Cambodian people.

AIDS AND BREAST-FEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An article on a United Nations conference to promote breast-feeding (Aug. 6) 
reported that "even mothers who have tested positive for the AIDS virus should 
breast-feed." 
</P>
<P>
This is appropriate advice for HIV-infected mothers in developing countries 
where infant mortality is high and where breast milk is the only source of 
uncontaminated food. 
</P>
<P>
However, it does not represent current policy in countries where serious 
illness associated with formula feeding is uncommon. In the U.S. and other 
developed countries, any beneficial effects of breast-feeding are offset by the 
possibility of transmission of HIV through milk. Two-thirds of babies born to 
HIV-infected mothers will not be infected. The Centers for Disease Control has 
recommended that HIV-infected women should be advised against breast-feeding.

MARION BARRY'S TRIAL AND BLACK LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How refreshing to read the column by David Dante Troutt about the Marion Barry 
decision ("Mayor Barry's Trial Raises Issues Unresolved in the Black 'Family,' 
" Opinion, Aug. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Instead of joyously celebrating a mixed decision and haranguing about racism, 
Troutt thoughtfully stepped back and gave us an insight to the much larger 
question of black leadership in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, instead of looking inward to see where his black leadership went 
wrong in recent years, Barry boldly took to the pulpit, sounded off as if he 
were royally acquitted and now has the audacity to run for another office 
("Barry Paves Way to Run for D.C. City Council," Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Barry has seen or heard the calm, reasoned almost painful appeal 
made by Troutt? 
</P>
<P>
Blacks in Washington deserve far more than this kind of "leadership."

<P>
It seems almost as real today as it was on that October morning in 1967. The 
band on the pier was playing "Anchors Aweigh" and slowly, my bride of three 
months was becoming harder and harder to distinguish in the waving, weeping 
crowd of wives and children. Leaning out over the catwalk of that giant 
aircraft carrier, I, too, fought away tears as I considered that I was on my 
way to a war. 
</P>
<P>
There was a clear battle already going on within me. On one hand, I was a 
warrior -- a naval aviator. I had volunteered, it was my job. I really hadn't 
gotten into it to be a warrior. I was just doing my duty -- making the 
contribution that I had decided the country required of me. One of my brothers 
tells me that when he called to express his sympathy upon hearing that I was 
going to Vietnam, I responded, "Hey, you do what you have to do, it's no big 
deal." I don't remember saying it, but I probably did. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, I was a pro -- well trained and good at what I did -- but unlike the 
Marines and fighter jocks, I wasn't itching for a fight. When the fighter 
squadron commander began his briefing for a training strike on an outlying 
Hawaiian island (our simulated Vietnam) by saying, "It will be good to be back 
over Hanoi," I said to myself, "That guy's weird. Not for me, it won't." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, I was leaving the one I held dearest (I could hardly see her 
now) and there was a cold hole in my gut as I wondered what lay ahead on the 
other side of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of combat missions later, I'd still sit on the end of the catapult, 
awaiting the inevitable amusement-park shot into the sky, wondering if this was 
the one I wouldn't return from (or worse, get captured on) -- but it was a kind 
of intellectual soliloquy. No big problem, I was just doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
It was all right until my friend Mike Dunn got shot down. We searched the black 
South China Sea for signs of him that night. Perhaps, we thought, his airplane 
was badly damaged but got him back to the ocean and he ejected. But there were 
no signs. 
</P>
<P>
I had been checking the daily classified message board every day. It was 
interesting reading -- a whole new perspective on what was going on. Each day I 
could see what our commanders wanted to hit -- significant targets that had the 
possibility of really damaging the enemy and ending this thing. But their 
requests were systematically denied by our political leaders in Washington. So 
we sent our crews in $4.5-million aircraft out into the night to hunt for 
$3,000 trucks. It was hard to find the trucks, but too often the North 
Vietnamese missile and anti-aircraft shooters fared better at finding our 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem right. It went against the grain of what I understood America 
stood for: We valued people. Human life was important. But here the "leaders" 
were depreciating our lives. We were pawns in a political game. We were being 
used to try to achieve fuzzy and elusive political goals framed by politicians 
who saw us as tools -- kind of like hammers and screwdrivers. There was no 
achievable plan -- no thought-out strategy. No one stood up to the plate and 
decided we were either going to win in a hurry or get out. Soldiers, sailors 
and airmen were, in a real sense, discounted -- used. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, that feeling's back. 
</P>
<P>
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, it was clear we had a really bad actor here 
-- a ruthless man who personally killed generals who had questioned military 
tactics that would lead to large losses of men. He is a menace of much greater 
proportions than some crazy holed up in a building with an assault rifle -- 
someone we would quickly try to eliminate. We really must rid the world of such 
people -- especially when they are trying to develop nuclear and biological 
weapons (to use along with chemical ones) in the most potentially explosive 
corner of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But what are our goals, and can they be achieved by starting a war? Have our 
political leaders thought out all of the scenarios that would come out of this 
little affair? Both my Jewish and Arab friends are using words like Armageddon 
to describe possible endings to this conflict. Are we simply shipping huge 
amounts of men and supplies, and beginning to talk about a multi-year presence 
in the Middle East and hoping that one way or another we will get out of this 
thing all right? Why does our President keep raising the rhetoric and walking 
out on a limb that it will be hard to back off of. Have he and his advisers not 
read Sun Tzu and Caesar, two of the greatest military strategists of all time? 
If so, where is the bridge -- the face-saving "out" -- that lets Hussein back 
down and not fight? Are we forcing him into a corner and giving him a reason to 
encourage Israel to enter the fray? What is the "American way of life" we are 
about to fight over? It's not about paying 50 cents a gallon more at the pump, 
is it? 
</P>
<P>
The questions are the same as those I asked about Vietnam. Only the time, 
location and risks are different. 
</P>
<P>
I had forgotten my feelings about Vietnam. But the other night my son called 
from Ft. Benning and said it was OK if he was shipped to Saudi Arabia, " 
because it's my job, Dad." And then I remembered.

THE LATEST SALVO IN WAR OF SOUND-BITES; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: SADDAM HUSSEIN DOES A BIT OF GROTESQUERIE FOR THE TV CAMERAS. BUT 
HE'S FAR FROM BEING ALONE IN THIS BATTLE OF EASILY ABSORBED IMAGES.

of an American Politician, 1913-1952 (Henry Holt &amp; Co.).

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein comes on in mufti for a specially televised 
appearance with a group of Western captives in Baghdad, including, of course, 
some children. "We want you to be safe," he tells his involuntary guests. 
</P>
<P>
One thinks of grainy old images -- of a smiling Josef Stalin patting the head 
of some peasant girl while he sends her parents to the gulag, of Adolf Hitler 
on his flower-strewn way through the Sudetenland for his last territorial 
demand, of Richard Nixon telling war protesters that he is ending the war as 
U.S. troops pour into Cambodia. These staged displays are timelessly ugly, and 
full of irony. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is something all too contemporary, and even more savage, symbolized 
in Hussein's bit of grotesquerie. This was only the latest salvo, after all, in 
the media war we call the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It is a conflict that bridges all gaps. The inscrutable Middle East meets 
Kennebunkport in the common idiom and expedience of video diplomacy. Like its 
precursors, the soap opera or campaign ad, the media war and its messy 
geopolitics are reduced to easily absorbed images. 
</P>
<P>
So it has been with George Bush, a President of the United States with his own 
guns of August, now playing an awkward round of golf, now drawn up in 
herringbone jacket and equally stylish truculence before the vigilant CNN crew, 
making policy and history to fit the quiet whine of cartridge tape and 
satellite signals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's roly-poly tout and chief of staff, John Sununu, assures us that the 
President is on top of the media war, and not off (like poor, untutored Jimmy 
Carter), "brooding" in the Oval Office, which might be confused with rethinking 
one's acts. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, like Hussein extending hospitality to his prisoners, we have gradually, 
almost imperceptibly, escalated our war aims with each new shoot on the summer 
White House lawn -- from defense of Saudi Arabia to the reconquest of Kuwait to 
the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the establishment of a more polite and 
pliable Iraqi regime. One wonders if American troops in the desert would see in 
presidential press conferences the same ironies we saw in Hussein's grim 
mustering in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
What has been produced, in any event, is some of the most mindless and tragic 
jingoism in American history. What has been lost is any serious understanding 
fo the convoluted politics, economics and history of this mad confrontation. If 
American blood is spilled, never will our men have shed it -- not even in the 
worst convenience of empire -- with so little public knowledge of the genuine 
reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
But at least the omnipresent, obliging television cameras reveal something -- 
the frightening improvisation of it all, the occasionally unconcealable strain 
of two weak, posturing protagonists, facing off over banks of lights and 
microphones, their arsenals of poison and missiles mercifully and discreetly 
off camera. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the next century will call this the sound-bite war, or the video 
expedition. It will make the body bags -- already stockpiled in Arabia -- so 
much less noticeable when they begin to come home.

CELIBACY: RECENT SCANDALS NOTWITHSTANDING, THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR PRIESTLY 
ABSTINENCE. WE JUST SHOULDN'T BE SO SHOCKED AT HUMAN FRAILTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW M. GREELEY, Father Andrew Greeley, author of The Cardinal Sins and 
Cardinal Virtues (Warner Books) is a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the silly season on celibacy in the Catholic Church. The tragicomedy of 
the Archbishop of Atlanta, and psychologist A.W. Richard Sipe's new book 
ripping apart priestly celibacy, have evoked mock horror from the national 
media, an Oprah Winfrey show (can Geraldo be far behind?) and foolish comments 
from those priests and former priests who comment routinely on Catholic matters 
for the media in the absence of official spokespersons with any credibility. 
</P>
<P>
It's time someone says what is obvious truth: Celibate priests are about as 
happy and well-adjusted and emotionally mature as married men of the same age 
and educational background, who sometimes aren't all that ecstatic with their 
lot. Those of us who like the work of priests are no less content with life 
than married men who like their wives. Moreover, unlike Sipe's estimate that no 
more than 50% of priests are celibate at any given time, my assertions are not 
guesses but are based on national sample data. 
</P>
<P>
A priest-theologian who comments on everything says that the Atlanta case 
proves that celibacy is at dead end. Come on! Archbishop Eugene Marino is the 
first bishop in history to have a mistress? Priests are humans, like everyone 
else, and have through the course of history made all the mistakes and been 
liable to all the frailties of other humans. 
</P>
<P>
Even bishops are human, though some not obviously so. 
</P>
<P>
My reaction to the Atlanta situation is to thank heaven that, given the present 
problems in the church, the lover wasn't another man or a little boy. 
</P>
<P>
As for support and respect for priests, which some "experts" claim is 
declining, such experts haven't spent much time out in the parishes. The laity 
say that the priest, as religious leader, is more important than he ever was 
and have great respect for him, provided he is professionally competent at his 
work. That's the rub, of course -- there is no substitute for competence. 
</P>
<P>
However wild some of Sipe's guesses are, there is no point in pretending that 
some priests are not faithful to their commitments some of the time. Whoever 
said they were? Some married men are not faithful, either. Some marriages end 
in divorce. Some marriages are not very happy. Some married men are not very 
mature. Who said it should be different for priests? 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it to be doubted that only some of us reach a state that Sipe calls 
"literally sublimated sexual energies" -- full celibate sexual maturity. How 
many married men reach full marital sexual maturity? 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, someone ought to say that when a man like Sipe, who abandoned his 
own priestly commitment, accuses those of us who honor it of not doing a 
perfect job, one hears a bit of axe-grinding in the background, a touch of 
self-justification, a smidgen of guilt and defensiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Sipe also says that the church has no articulate theory of either celibate 
commitment or human sexuality and does not prepare men for a celibate life. He 
gets no argument from me on these points. The church merely says that it's a 
rule and that's that. You gotta keep to the rule because we say it's the rule. 
For that reason, many priests are uncertain about the purpose in celibacy and 
reluctant to recruit young men to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
It does not follow that some of us have not worked out a sophisticated and 
comprehensive rationale for our vocation. Nor does it follow that we don't like 
women and are not capable of strong friendships with them that do not violate 
our vocation. 
</P>
<P>
While supporting the ordination of women and even the idea of limited-term 
service in the priesthood, we understand that celibacy frees us to serve more 
people more intensively, that it shows that men can care strongly about women 
and not necessarily make genital love with them and that celibacy is a 
fascinating sign of God's presence in the world. Imagine "Thorn Birds" or even 
"The Cardinal Sins" about a married cleric: dullsville. Celibates draw 
attention to the presence of God. 
</P>
<P>
If the church had not tried to pretend for ages that priests were't subject to 
human faults (and thus made them inhuman), there would be no grounds for shock 
when the human frailties of priests were revealed. If Jesus wanted his clergy 
to be immune from sexual temptations, weaknesses and failings, he would have 
chosen angels for the job instead of human beings.

HIGH OIL PRICES KEEP KEY BOND YIELD ABOVE 9%

Government bond prices fell Thursday in light trading as oil prices continued 
their climb, keeping the key long-term interest rate above 9% for the second 
day. 
</P>
<P>
High-yield junk bond prices also dropped sharply as stock prices tumbled in 
wild trading for the third consecutive day. The Dow Jones average of 30 
industrials plunged 76.73 to 2,483.42. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 25/32 of a point, or 
$7.81 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield climbed to 9.13% from 9.05% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an oil day to a great extent," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief 
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But bond prices did not slip as far as they did Wednesday, when the yield on 
the 30-year "long" bond exceeded 9% for the first time since May. That was 
mainly because oil prices did not rise as much as Wednesday, Ricchiuto said. 
</P>

The long-bond yield is a benchmark figure used to determine the interest rates 
on some mortgages and other loans. 
</P>
<P>
An additional factor weakening bond prices was a government report on durable 
goods orders, Ricchiuto said. The Commerce Department said factory orders for 
"big-ticket" durable goods rebounded 2.9% in July, a higher rate than many Wall 
Street experts had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of an upturn in the economy can hurt bond prices because it lessens the 
likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates. Lower rates 
benefit fixed-return investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But one bond trader, speaking anonymously, said the market was focused almost 
entirely on the Iraqi situation and paid little attention to the durable goods 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market's tone was set by trading overseas, where bond prices dropped 
before domestic markets opened, Ricchiuto said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.063%, down from 8.125% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds fell 1-5/32 to 88.5. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.71% from 
7.60% late Wednesday.

<P>
Gold Gains Slightly; Cattle, Pork in Slide 
</P>
<P>
Prices of gold futures posted only modest gains at the Commodity Exchange in 
New York, despite soaring oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, cattle futures plunged the daily limit and grains and 
soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
The December gold contract has repeatedly touched the $425 level but has lacked 
the punch to break through. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time it reaches that price it runs into extremely good selling," said 
David Syphen, manager of metal futures for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. 
in New York. "It shows a fundamental weakness in the market, with very, very 
willing sellers at those levels." 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the oil market turns around, "there's going to be quite a long 
slide for gold." 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1 to $1.40 higher, with the December contract at $420.30 an 
ounce; silver was 0.5 cent lower to 0.1 cent higher, with September at $5.135 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
There was no letup of the Mideast crisis at the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures prices plunged as concern grew about the implications of the 
Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Pork futures also suffered a setback, particularly bellies, which were down the 
limit for the third consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
Beef is more expensive than pork at the meat counter now, making cattle much 
more vulnerable to outside price swings, said Phil Stanley, a trader at the 
Merc.

DOLLAR HITS LOWS AGAINST MARK, SWISS FRANC

<P>
The dollar continued its losing streak Thursday, falling broadly to achieve new 
lows against the German mark and the Swiss franc. It reached its lowest level 
in nearly nine years against the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the dollar succumbed to expectations that the already sluggish U.S. 
economy will be further weakened by fallout from the tensions in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at a new European closing low of 1.5478 German marks, down 
from 1.5535 marks late Wednesday. The dollar fell further in later New York 
trading, declining to 1.5445 marks from 1.5575 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's previous lowest close against the mark had been 1.5485 marks, 
reached just last Friday in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some West German dealers said they doubted that the dollar would go below 
1.5400 marks after touching that level during trading Thursday. "I think the 
dollar is finished for the time being at 1.5400 after it tested that level 
several times during the afternoon but didn't manage to break through," said 
Wolfgang Grebe, currency dealer at Credit Lyonnais in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. analysts were pessimistic about the dollar reaching bottom soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Corrective upticks (for the dollar) are very limited, and people are viewing 
even the smallest corrections as selling opportunities," said Pete Grant, a 
currency analyst with Money Market Services in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We would look for further declines in the dollar," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has sent oil and gasoline prices sharply 
higher, and economists fear that this will worsen American economic troubles. 
Traders believe that the Federal Reserve, faced with soaring inflation, is less 
likely to nudge U.S. interest rates downward to stimulate the sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates detract from the dollar's value because it can't compete 
with currencies of countries with higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hatcher, a corporate foreign exchange dealer with Barclays Bank PLC in 
New York, said the dollar probably will fall further unless central banks, 
including the Federal Reserve, decide that the U.S. currency has fallen far 
enough. However, there are no signs the banks are concerned about the dollar's 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its broad setback Thursday, the dollar did finish above its lows for 
the day. Traders said a report that durable goods orders rose 2.9% in July was 
three times larger than expected, suggesting to some that the economy may not 
be as weak as expected. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached a new closing low against the Swiss franc, dropping in 
Europe to 1.2598 francs from 1.2735 late Wednesday and to 1.2560 francs in New 
York from 1.2775. 
</P>
<P>
The previous low close was 1.2685 Swiss francs, set Dec. 31, 1987 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell to its lowest level since December, 1981, against 
the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
The pound rose to $1.9515 in London from $1.9275 late Wednesday and to $1.9570 
in New York from $1.9235. That was sterling's highest close against the dollar 
since it was quoted at $1.9545 on Dec. 2, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1981, the pound reached $2.0014. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing of 145.88 Japanese yen from 146.92 yen 
at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 146.38 yen, 
and in New York, the dollar edged down to 146.12 yen from late Wednesday's 
146.15. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday prices, 
included: 5.1855 French francs, down from 5.2390; 1,152.00 Italian lire, down 
from 1,162.25; and 1.12925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13535. 
</P>
<P>
DOLLAR RATES FOR MARK, POUND 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to a postwar low of 1.5478 marks per dollar in Europe on 
Thursday and sank even further in New York trading. The British pound climbed 
to its highest point against the dollar in nearly nine years.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / MITSUBISHI 3000GT: A SPORTS CAR TOUR DE FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CARMEL VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, sports car sales were largely limited to the Mazda RX7, used 
car lots and a cottage industry building ghastly fiberglass replicars. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody apparently had decreed we didn't really want cars pandering to such 
antisocial behavior as individualism and the child-racer in all of us. It 
probably was the same marketing consultant who said that if adults can do 
without teddy bears, they could certainly get along without convertibles. 
</P>
<P>
But we beat 'em, by golly. Convertibles came back. So have sports cars. Now 
there's a new, growing and freer generation of grinning Americans riding lower 
in 300ZXs, snorting breezes in Miatas and thoroughly enjoying the addiction. 
</P>
<P>
There's a car re-creating the British roadsters of the '60s, a snarling slope 
nose implying the mid-engined soul of Italian motoring, and a covey of sport 
coupes to defoliate the laurels of Porsche. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Missing -- at least for anyone who can't afford a Mercedes SL, which is just 
about everyone -- has been one of those big cat sports cars; a comfortable road 
animal broad of track and long of leg, capable of blowing past everything. Con 
mucho gusto and only a tiny twitch of guilt. Preferably on the A6 leaving Paris 
for the South. 
</P>
<P>
Now, from Mitsubishi, comes the 3000GT, which is perfectly cast in this role of 
the grand touring sports car. 
</P>
<P>
It weighs close to two tons. It has leather armchairs for the perfect couple 
and a trunk looking for luggage by Louis Vitton. Entrance and exit is not a 
decathlon event. The car has style, is well-educated and does not fidget. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with twin turbochargers performing CPR on a 24-valve V-6, the full-house 
Mitsubishi 3000GT develops 300 horsepower and accelerates from rest to 60 
m.p.h. in about six seconds. Porsche, Ferrari, Acura NSX and Corvette live in 
that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Each of those high performance marques will run around 160 m.p.h. So does the 
Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mitzu does it for about $31,500 -- and that's for the top banana 3000GT 
VR4 fully optioned down to its leather upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
The miracle continues. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a handling assist or a transportation safety item -- short of 
ejection seats and self-sealing gas tanks -- that isn't built into the 3000GT 
VR4. 
</P>
<P>
It is the world's first high-performance car to offer both all-wheel drive for 
tighter road grip and four-wheel steering for precision handling. The anti-lock 
braking system is four-wheel. The independent suspension is four-wheel. 
Velocity with Reason secured by four of everything. Hence VR4. 
</P>
<P>
There's an electronically controlled suspension that automatically adjusts the 
shocks to soft, medium or firm. It better dampens the hammering imposed by 
lumpy roads or lunkhead handling, keeping everything stiff, flat and balanced 
for whatever might be around the next corner. 
</P>
<P>
And if this doesn't bring finesse to fast passage, Mitsubishi adds what it has 
trademarked as "Active Aero," a system that automatically tilts the rear 
spoiler (borrowing a concept pioneered by Porsche) while lowering the front air 
dam. 
</P>
<P>
Both slide out at 50 m.p.h. to increase front and rear downforce, i.e. 
diverting air flowing over and under the car so it holds the vehicle down, 
reducing that moment of high-speed indecision when an aerodynamic vehicle needs 
to be reminded that it is a car, not an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing the car to the motoring media here this month, executives of 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America stressed that it is easy to build a fast, 
safe, high-technology car that few people can afford. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, said Executive Vice President Richard Recchia, is creating an 
affordable car that can "expand the driving limits of the average driver." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi, on its initial reach into the world of refined muscle cars, has 
done just that, and the hit is dead center. 
</P>
<P>
The line (to be re-badged under the Chrysler-Mitsubishi partnership and sold as 
the Dodge Stealth) starts with the 3000GT, which goes on sale next month at a 
price Mitsubishi estimates as "under $20,000." On the GT, the V-6 is not 
turbocharged and engine power is reduced to 222 horsepower. Anti-lock brakes 
and driver air bag are options on this model. 
</P>
<P>
The 3000GT SL, said Mitsubishi, will cost "under $25,000." The automatic 
suspension system, anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control, alarm and a 
six-speaker, 100-watt sound system are standard. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the all-wheel steer, all-wheel drive, all-inclusive and almighty 
3000GT VR4. 
</P>
<P>
It looks heavy, purposeful and clearly is longer, wider and lower than the 
Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo it was built to unhorse. There's a pinched waist to the 
car that apparently has much more to do with styling (Raymond Loewy used the 
same Coke-bottle squeeze play on the Avanti) and reflections than aerodynamics. 
</P>
<P>
In silhouette, there's a little bit of last year's Eclipse to the front and a 
trace of Toyota Celica in the bustle. Overall, see an MR2 that ate all its 
Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
The front end -- with intakes next to the fog lamps feeding the intercoolers -- 
is quite smart. We also salute the genius who added flush lenses to the 
headlights to allow fast-lane flashing without the headlights popping up. 
</P>
<P>
The blemishes, however, are nothing short of extraordinary in a vehicle of this 
sophistication. Forward of the rear wheels are air intakes that carry air 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
They are dummies, styling sleights and cues filched from the functional vents 
on all Ferraris. It is an odd note for a vehicle that in most other departments 
not only holds its own but actually leads the way. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the hood are two more warts. 
</P>
<P>
"Blisters in the hood," explains a Mitsubishi press release, "permit a low, 
aerodynamic hood line without compromising front suspension travel." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, it looks as if some unthinking type compromised that low, aerodynamic 
hood line by mounting the shock absorbers where they would make like jack 
hammers against the hood. 
</P>
<P>
Can't have that, said the body man. 
</P>
<P>
But you could patch the hood, said the suspension man, call them blisters and 
pass them off as part of the styling. 
</P>
<P>
Right. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the car is clean, friendly, with intuitive placement of hand 
brake, shifter, turn signals and other manual controls. Seating is rich, 
adjustment makes all upholstered convexes fit the driver's concaves and there 
is superb pneumatic lumbar support. 
</P>
<P>
Headroom is sufficient for 6-footers and above. Legroom is a full stretch on 
both driver and passenger sides. But rearward vision, particularly when the 
spoiler starts doing push-ups, can be a little cluttered. 
</P>
<P>
Hand grips built into each door are a nice touch. The passenger's grip is right 
at hand. The forearm braces well against a ledge close to the grip. So when 
things get adventuresome, a passenger can hang on for grim death and nobody 
will notice the bloodless knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
And things will indeed get adventuresome in the 3000GT VR4. 
</P>
<P>
Peak torque arrives with the engine turning at only 2,400 revolutions, so huge 
power is readily available for fast starts. Turbo lag is barely noticeable. The 
all-wheel drive partnered by broad tires on 17-inch wheels makes for quiet, 
unflappable takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If it weren't for the velocity and some rude snorts from the exhaust (which, 
incidentally, is fitted with a cutout for changing the note from deep purr to 
naughty rasp), things would appear almost polite. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth gear is in a world of its own and pure overdrive. It allows long, 
wonderful loping that if Highway 101 were an autobahn and that was Munich, not 
Salinas, ahead, you'd be looking at a 125-m.p.h. cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-range performance of the car -- snapping from fourth to third with a 
shifter that's both quick and positive -- is almost gymnastic. Braking on 
12-inch discs leaves no doubt that this car will stop wherever and whenever it 
is told, and with little of the pedal surging and foot pounding associated with 
most anti-lock systems. 
</P>
<P>
With all wheels pointing and powering in the same direction, steering response, 
of course, is immediate. The smallest adjustments correct the grossest errors 
of braking or throttle mismanagement until a single conclusion forms: It would 
take an absolute duffer doing the totally inexcusable on the worst of surfaces 
to get this car sideways or into the boonies. 
</P>
<P>
It is a performance car that is a delight to drive very hard. It was built to 
run and without protest. 
</P>
<P>
There is a boldness here. No matter the night, no matter the huge distance, no 
matter the hour, the heft and ability of the car becomes the satisfaction of 
the task. 
</P>
<P>
And that, dear lovers of better things in life, is the near-forgotten pleasure 
of grand touring.

HOT TO SHOP: A BONANZA OF CHEAP THRILLS

DEAR HOT: I'm broke. In debt. And I need a lift. Is there anything you 
recommend that I can buy for about $5 to boost my spirits? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.G., Marina del Rey 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.G.: Pile up those nickels and dimes and lug them over to a $5 Clothing 
Store. We've known ingenious, ultra-frugal fashion models who've put together 
great-looking outfits in these places -- often for less than a meal at 
McDonalds. 
</P>
<P>
The shops (80 in California, 45 in the metropolitan Los Angeles area) 
specialize in fun, youthful junior styles, with nothing priced over $8. We 
know: The sign says $5. Explains Morrie Dym, the chain's founder and president, 
"Nothing in the stores sold for more than $5 for the first five years." 
(1981-1986). 
</P>
<P>
But you can still pick up tank tops priced at $3, $4 and $5. Shorts for $4, $5 
and $6. Jewelry, hair accessories, scarves and belts usually for less than $5. 
And, if you want to get really extravagant and break out some serious bucks, go 
all out and indulge yourself with a dress for $8. Better yet, visit during the 
stores' "Dollar Days" promotions, which occur about twice a year. All the 
previous markdowns are then sold for $1, and you can whip together a whole 
outfit for $5! For $5 Clothing Store locations, call (800) 766-5555. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: My 15-month-old little girl is taking her first steps -- very 
tentatively. Mostly, she stands up holding onto something, like a chair, so 
she's not really walking around yet. While she's in this phase, I'm not sure 
what kind of shoes I should be putting her in. Those hard-soled shoes for 
toddlers look so uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.S., Echo Park 
</P>
<P>
DEAR C.S.: You're on the right track, making sure your daughter's tootsies feel 
good as she learns to walk. In fact, Dr. Stuart Slavin, assistant professor in 
pediatrics at UCLA, advises parents of toddlers to "find shoes that look like 
they'd be comfortable; somewhat flexible, not terribly stiff. Also, the best 
shoes are made of material that breathes -- something with a canvas upper is 
probably better than heavy leather. Shoes are protection for the feet, so you 
want to make sure the sole is thick enough. And don't get shoes that are too 
small -- make sure the foot can move around." 
</P>
<P>
Childrens' shoes don't have to cost an arm and a leg -- or a foot, either -- 
even though we've found some kids' clothes that cost as much as their adult 
counterparts. The Nowa Li moccasins with a knitted sock upper and non-skid 
suede bottom, are $14 from Cotton Kids in the Santa Monica Place mall. The 
store also offers Mary Jane-style, canvas slip-ons for $16, sandals for $18.50, 
tennis shoe slip-ons for $19 and high-top tennies for $19. The moccasins, in 
various sizes, are also available through the store's catalogue (it's called 
Tinibini); to order, call (800) 543-6665. 
</P>

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: WHEN SEX IS PAINFUL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: After 40 years of a satisfying marriage, I find that having sexual 
relations has become painful. 
</P>
<P>
I have no desire to start on a series of tests or to undergo extensive 
treatment, but I would like to do something about the problem. Could there 
possibly be any simple solutions to such a problem? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The solution to the problem you raised may not require extensive tests 
or treatments. For example, the use of estrogen replacement therapy or 
lubricants may be sufficient to eliminate the discomfort you are experiencing. 
I suggest you check with your physician. You may be pleasantly surprised at how 
simple the solution may be.

SHOWCASE FOR A WIDE-RANGING TALENT

<TEXT>
<P>
The narrator of the title story -- "The Orange Fish" -- in this collection of 
short stories by Carol Shields candidly admits that for the past 12 years, he's 
been unhappily married to a lawyer who would have preferred to live in 
Vancouver and raise dahlias, while he still toys with his dream of owning a 
dude ranch. This morning, he's staring at a small blank patch above the 
breakfast table, trying to transfer the pain of his ulcer to that spot on the 
wall, doing his best to forget that his 40th birthday is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need," he says, gesturing at the void, "is a picture." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, they're the owners of a bright lithograph in green and orange; a 
merry fish at ease in his element. The quality of life improves almost at once. 
The ulcer subsides, the marriage revives, and when an invitation arrives 
summoning the 10 owners of the fish lithograph to a meeting, they go. 
</P>
<P>
The evening is rather like AA, with various people rising to testify about how 
the picture has changed their luck, or their outlook, which amounts to the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they speak, thousands of orange fish posters are rolling off the 
presses, to be followed by buttons, earrings, sweat shirts and neckties. The 
story mercifully ends there, before anyone says "Keep swimming" after bagging 
the groceries or filling the gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
Although a palpable ruefulness suffuses several of the stories, others are 
broadly comic. 
</P>
<P>
In "Chemistry," the protagonist recalls a winter in the early 1970s when he was 
in an advanced recorder class at a Montreal YMCA and intensely aware of the 
woman next to him: "the hollows of your bent elbows and the seam of your upper 
lip . . . the bony intimacy of your instep circling in air." 
</P>
<P>
For a season, this small, ill-assorted group plays as one, "music so cool and 
muffled it seems smoothed into place by a thumb." Then suddenly it's spring; 
the class is over and the members disperse, leaving the narrator with the 
lingering fantasy that one day he'll find an envelope in his mailbox from the 
owner of those elbows and that instep. 
</P>
<P>
"Hazel" is the story of a widow who refuses to accept the fate of other women 
in her position. She takes a job demonstrating kitchen appliances, embarrassing 
her daughters and astonishing herself. Wryly funny, this story puts convention 
in its place. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is more overt in "Block Out," in which a prolific author of junk 
novels is stalled by an acute attack of writer's block -- a boon to Canadian 
letters, but a tragedy for Meershank's second wife, who doubles as his agent. 
</P>
<P>
Although she brings him ethnic delicacies, imported pears and stimulating 
gossip from Toronto's literary marketplace, she is unable to effect a cure. 
Despite her strenuous efforts, "in the end, it's a matter of waiting things out 
in an improvised shelter and thinking as kindly of yourself as possible." 
</P>
<P>
In "Collision," we leave Canada for a larger universe, one in which Shields 
presents the provocative theory that our atmosphere not only consists of 
biographical data, but is rapidly becoming polluted by information about 
everyone who has ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else in this closed lonely system can our creaturely dust go but up 
there on top of the storied slag heap?" Kept plausible by a central character 
both realistic and endearing, "Collision" is a showcase for the author in a 
more ambitious mode. 
</P>
<P>
Even the less fanciful stories manage to put a fresh spin on what might 
otherwise be mundane domestic situations: a holiday dinner, a long drive over 
the empty prairie, a daughter's curiosity about a blank year in her mother's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Shields is at her best when her characters either finally manage to explain 
themselves to each other or fail in a valiant attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In one such conversation, a husband tells his wife that "the saddest thing that 
had ever happened . . . was seeing the movie 'Easy Rider,' and then coming home 
and climbing into a pair of striped pajamas and going to bed" -- a revelation 
that's par for the course.

Back to Court: Attorneys for Rodney Dangerfield want to bat allegations that 
the comedian was a chronic drug and alcohol abuser in his civil suit against 
Caesars Palace. In motions filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, 
the attorneys said the allegations were untrue and without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield's case against Caesars Palace, which was scheduled to go to trial 
Monday, has been postponed until Sept. 10. Caesars Palace attorneys filed court 
papers earlier this week claiming Dangerfield smokes marijuana, drinks vodka 
heavily and uses cocaine. The claims by the resort were made to show that 
Dangerfield was responsible for canceling a series of shows at Caesars. 
Dangerfield had sued Caesars for $225,000 in disputed contract money and 
medical and legal bills. BETH KLEID

NOT TO WORRY . . . ELLA IS STILL ELLA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An element of curiosity pervaded the Hollywood Bowl Wednesday evening, when 
Ella Fitzgerald made her first appearance since the widely publicized collapse 
and cancellation of dates during the European tour. 
</P>
<P>
Was she really well enough to go back to work? How had the illness affected 
her? The answer took a little while, since Benny Carter's orchestra played a 
35-minute opening set. Even then her presence was felt when Carter offered an 
ingenious version of "Lady Be Good" based mainly on Ella's famous recorded 
improvisations. (Later, Ella returned the compliment by singing Carter's tune 
"And All That Jazz.") 
</P>
<P>
When Her First Ladyship took to the stage, helped on by Carter and settled on a 
stool by the piano, all doubts were soon put to rest. The up tempos were 
buoyantly confident ("Sweet Georgia Brown," "Honeysuckle Rose"), the ballads 
only minimally affected by a slight quaver ("Somewhere in the Night," the old 
"Naked City" theme), and the blues a commanding reminder of how she deals with 
this classic idiom ("St. Louis Blues," with only occasional variations on W.C. 
Handy's original 1914 lyrics). 
</P>
<P>
As one singer in the audience commented, "Maybe Ella doesn't have the range and 
control she had when she was 25, but she has the style, the class, the 
phrasing, she swings -- and she's still Ella." 
</P>
<P>
On the early set she was backed by Carter's brass and sax sections and her own 
rhythm section, with the admirable Mike Wofford at the piano, Keter Betts on 
bass and Bobby Durham on drums. After intermission these three accompanied 
Carter in a reminder of the alto genius' dexterity, logic and total purity. 
</P>
<P>
The star then returned, wearing a gown even more attractive than the first one, 
seemingly more relaxed in the intimate company of her trio. She traded a few 
words with the audience: "What was that, dear? . . . I love you too." Cole 
Porter was well represented with "Night and Day," "Get Out of Town," "You Do 
Something to Me." Ella flexed her Portuguese in "Agua de Beber" before 
returning to American Standard Time, with "Body and Soul" and "The Man I Love." 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, just as she seemed to be faltering a little, she would 
suddenly reach up for a note an octave above the one you expected, and hit it 
right on the button, as if to assure us, "Don't worry about a thing, folks. I 
still got it." 
</P>
<P>
The finale was almost an echo of her old Jazz at the Philharmonic days, as 
Carter, trombonist Buster Cooper, Don Menza on tenor sax and a surprise guest, 
Sweets Edison on trumpet, jammed with her as she scatted through the Ray 
Eldridge tune "Little Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 Ella Fitzgerald had a hit record entitled "Dontcha Go 'way Mad." That 
was one plea she had no need to make Wednesday, when 17,965 fans (as many as 
you could cram in without a shoe horn) went away in a mood that mixed relief 
with delight. The living legend lives on.

A JEALOUSY FESTIVAL IN SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two jealous husbands. Two doomed wives. Two plays in one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It's true Shakespearean repertory, and it's thriving at Shakespeare Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Here last weekend, you could watch Charles Shaw Robinson as the schemer Iago 
and Ron Dortch as the jealous general in "Othello" on Saturday, then see 
Robinson and Dortch as victims of Othello-style jealousy in "The Winter's Tale" 
on Sunday. For Dante Di Loreto, the roles were reversed: the innocent Cassio in 
"Othello," the furiously avenging Leontes in "The Winter's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
This cross-production actor-watching wouldn't be much fun if the productions 
didn't stand up strongly on their own. These do. 
</P>
<P>
This "Othello," directed by former Angeleno Mark Rucker in the 540-seat 
Performing Arts Theatre at UC Santa Cruz, is a whirlwind, a production that 
really roars. "The Winter's Tale," in the outdoor Festival Glen, operates at a 
more leisurely pace, befitting the play, but most of it is intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
"Othello" is set in a contemporary American naval setting. Driving, bombastic 
music. Dress whites and tans. Solid, anonymous desks. The names of 
Shakespeare's locales, Venice and Cyprus, are unchanged. But it doesn't seem 
impossible that Cyprus, at any rate, might be used as a base from which to 
stage raids into Iraq or Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the setting works best not for cosmetic or speculative reasons, but because 
Robinson plays Iago as a very American, street-savvy bully, the kind of guy who 
was pushed into the Navy by his parents 20 years ago -- so they wouldn't have 
to deal with him any more -- and whose guile has since raised him through the 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
He has a tattoo on his arm and a barking laugh. He likes to shadow box and slap 
his comrades on the back. When he wants to act impressed, he whistles. When he 
wraps himself around his wife (Amy Thone, in military garb that reflects her 
no-nonsense manner), first seductively and then threateningly, it's chilling. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch's Othello seems a calm, judicious fellow. But when Robinson begins to 
drop his hints about Desdemona and Cassio, this general quickly loses his 
command over the situation. In one extraordinarily moving moment, Dortch 
unleashes a gospel-tinged howl of grief and anger that shakes the theater. His 
Desdemona, Camilia Sanes, moves with the sort of sensuous grace that might be 
misinterpreted by a jealous husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The Winter's Tale" in an outdoor glen in the summer? Well, the somber 
contemporary suits of the first half, set amid court intrigues, do look odd 
next to the sun-dappled redwoods in Santa Cruz. But when a giant bear emerges 
from behind the flat, circular stage, and consumes one of the characters, 
suddenly the sylvan setting seems perfectly appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, much of "Winter's Tale" has a summery feeling; the play's middle 
section is set at a sheep-shearing event, staged here as a hillbilly fair, and 
the colors are lively during this part of the staging by British director Sarah 
Pia Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The accents wandered a bit farther astray than one might expect, and vocal 
projection wasn't helped by a slightly buzzy sound system. Still, these young 
Santa Cruz actors do make most of the great poetry accessible and fluent. 
</P>
<P>
Although I didn't see it, "Amadeus" is the third entry in this season -- yet 
another take on jealousy, this time of the professional variety. Working in one 
of the most appealing summertime retreats imaginable -- the hilltop campus of 
UC Santa Cruz -- artistic director Michael Richards has put together a season 
that stimulates both serious cerebration and blithe celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 It continues through Sept. 2. $15-$18; (408) 459-4168.

ARMATRADING CONDUCTS HER FAMILIAR RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sneak into the Wiltern Theatre today and you may still be able to see Joan 
Armatrading's smile hanging Cheshire Cat-like, left over from her concert on 
Wednesday. Her grin is one of the brightest around, an infectious display of 
pearly whites that opens up at the slightest show of affection from her fans. 
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday -- as usual -- the affection for her poured forth freely. Her 
cult following, built through an 18-year recording career, is among the most 
loyal and appreciative in pop, even if it hasn't expanded. That underscored the 
pluses and minuses of this show. On the up side, Armatrading treated her fans 
to a greatest-hits selection of quality material. On the down side, it was 
pretty much the same concert experience she has been offering for the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Such thematic touchstones as "I'm Lucky," "Love and Affection" and the standard 
show-closer "Willow" are indispensable, but they've become predictable and 
ritualistic parts of the show. Songs from her fine new "Hearts and Flowers" 
album were relegated to secondary status in the two-hour-plus set. And most of 
the older numbers were played by her five-piece band in soul-reggae-folk-rock 
arrangements hardly varying from the original recordings. 
</P>
<P>
What could Armatrading do? First of all, play more electric guitar. The few 
times she strapped on her Stratocaster the music really came alive, especially 
for the rocking encore one-two of "Me Myself I" and "Ma-Me-O Beach." But more 
to the point, she has got the kind of audience that will follow her anywhere; 
she should take more advantage of that opportunity. STEVE HOCHMAN

PUBLIC ENEMY BLENDS FUNK AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday was another summer night at the Greek Theatre. Balmy breezes, 
thrumming crickets . . . and rap superstars Public Enemy, pounding their blend 
of funk and politics into the swaying, party-hearty crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The group played some big Palace dates a few months ago, but this was really 
its first L.A. show centered on the songs from its latest album, "Fear of a 
Black Planet." The question of the evening was how the new, harder-edged 
material would work with its already plenty-controversial older stuff. Pretty 
well, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Lead rapper Chuck D. played it to the hilt, especially in the song "Welcome to 
the Terrordome," shrugging exaggeratedly when he rapped the line "apology made 
to whoever pleases," crossing himself when he followed with "still they got me 
like Jesus." His speeches were almost as entertaining as the songs. And a 
Public Enemy show is live, unpredictable and tension-filled like nothing else 
in rap. 
</P>
<P>
For the song "Burn Hollywood Burn," which criticizes racist media stereotypes 
of African-Americans, L.A. rapper Ice Cube played out something of a stereotype 
himself, spewing four-letter words and gleeful descriptions of violent crime 
while Chuck beamed paternally and girls in the audience screamed (Ice Cube is 
kind of cute). PE's clown prince, Flavor Flav, seemed something of an elder 
statesman in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy (which headlines the San Diego Sports Arena on Sunday) was dressed 
for the occasion, Chuck in a white Raiders jacket instead of a black one, the 
S1Ws, PE's dancers, in crisp, white naval uniforms where they usually wear 
camouflage-pattern guerrilla outfits. JONATHAN GOLD

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: BRITISH COMEDY SAMPLES RUN GAMUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
British comedy ranges from the hilariously outrageous to the passably farcical 
to the miserable misfire. CBS/Fox gives Anglophiles a video taste of each this 
week -- in the form of a hit movie and two cult TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
The hit movie, "Nuns on the Run" ($89.98, PG-13), is the passably farcical 
example. Neither as good as you might expect from the presence of a Monty 
Python member (Eric Idle), nor as bad as Siskel and Ebert made out, this rather 
soft-headed but just-funny-enough comedy casts Idle and Robbie Coltrane as 
half-hearted apprentice gangsters who hide out in habits at a convent after 
double-crossing their bosses. Camille Coduri is likable as the sweet but very 
near-sighted woman who tries to help the pair. 
</P>
<P>
The hilarious outrageous tape is "The Young Ones" ($19.98), a collection of 
three episodes from the truly anarchic British series that used to be repeated 
over and over on MTV. Brilliantly performed by members of England's inventive 
Comic Strip group (from which Coltrane of "Nuns" also emerged), the series 
about three young men who share a very strange London house is hard to 
describe, but Monty Python-goes-punk will do for a starter. Well timed -- just 
when we fans began to miss the series after thinking we were sick of the reruns 
-- the 96-minute cassette contains "Oil," "Flood" (the most surreal show) and 
"Boring" (possibly the best). 
</P>
<P>
The miserable misfire label gets stuck on "Black Adder the Third, Part II" 
($19.98), an 89-minute tape containing three episodes from a series (shown on 
A&amp;E cable) that tried to spoof the Middle Ages in Python style with an 
astounding lack of success, starring forever-mugging English comic Rowan 
Atkinson (no relation, thank goodness). TERRY ATKINSON

LIFESTYLES: SERVICEMEN BOUND FOR SAUDI ARABIA LEARN THE DO'S AND DON'TS OF ARAB

CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Marines bound for the Middle East are receiving, along with their 
chemical-weapons gear a fast Emily Post course on how to avoid ugly Americanism 
in a foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
Don't pass the bread with your left hand. Never give the A-OK sign. Refrain 
from gawking. If introduced to an Arab man -- women are out of the question -- 
stand close to him. Real close. And don't be startled if he takes your hand. 
</P>
<P>
That was some of the advice given to 50 Marines here Thursday -- an almost non 
sequitur element of training that, for the most part, has focused on weapons 
and gas masks and acclimation to searing desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
But for these Marines, sitting in rapt attention -- some taking copious notes 
-- in a large Camp Pendleton conference room usually reserved for entertaining 
officers, the advice was intended to ease the merging of cultures suddenly 
bonded by war. 
</P>
<P>
Never cross your legs when sitting among Arabs, warned Navy Cmdr. Stanley B. 
Scott, because exposing the underside of your shoes to your guest is an insult 
something akin to swearing, "Camel dung on you!" 
</P>
<P>
When Muslims set out their prayer rugs at midday in a public area, do not take 
pictures and do not gawk. Keep walking, but take the long way around their back 
side, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
If you should be invited into an Arab's home, don't expect to see any women. 
They'll be in the kitchen, strictly off-limits to visitors. And, if you come 
across an Arab woman in public, don't even think about asking her what she's 
doing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
If you compliment an Arab on his headdress, expect him to promptly offer it to 
you as a gift. Not only had you better accept, Scott said, but you'd better 
offer a reciprocal gift -- your own hat. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went Thursday at Camp Pendleton, with Scott giving another of his 
two- or three-times-daily briefings to Marines about Middle Eastern culture and 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a United Methodist minister and senior chaplain to the 1st Marine 
Division based at Camp Pendleton, spent three years in Bahrain and traveled 
throughout the Middle East, marking him as a local expert of sorts on Arab 
customs and culture. So, for the past two weeks, he has been holding forth 
daily for as many as 600 Marines at a time about how they should behave off the 
battlefield as guests in Saudia Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks mirrored the contents of a 40-page booklet produced by the Army and 
already distributed to U.S. servicemen overseas, covering such subjects as how 
to greet Arab men and warning that joining your forefinger and thumb and waving 
doesn't mean everything's A-OK. It's a curse. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Scott talked of such things as Arab speaking patterns, native 
dress, marriage and family values, food, drink and religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to warn and sensitize Marines to what may lie ahead for them, 
and added: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about how we'll be received. Not the short term, but how we'll get 
along with them down the road, 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
He rationalized that the absence of women Marines in combat positions in Saudia 
Arabia would be welcomed by Arabs, given the subservient role of women in an 
Arab society. "I think the Marine Corps is showing a great deal of maturity and 
prudence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, Scott focused on the cultural dos and don'ts, wanting to reduce 
the risk of an ugly American surfacing in a strange land where what seems right 
is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Men holding hands, or embracing, or exchanging kisses on the cheek? They're 
friends, not homosexuals, Scott advised. Good to know, the Marines thought. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring women in public? That's the best way to show them -- and their 
families -- honor and respect, he said. Aha, the Marines noted. "I thought they 
were treating them like dogs," Lance Cpl. Jerris Marr said. 
</P>
<P>
Don't beckon an Arab by pointing at him palm up and curling your fingers 
upward. That's how you get a dog's attention, he said. For an Arab, turn your 
palm down, and then curl your fingers back toward you. 
</P>
<P>
Don't figure on sharing a bottle of wine or popping a six-pack of beer because 
the Koran has declared alcohol taboo -- along with adultery, fornication, 
pornography and the eating of pork. If invited into an Arab's home, figure on 
drinking coffee or tea. And to hold your empty cup out at arm's length and to 
wiggle it won't bring a refill. It signals the servant that you're filled to 
the gills, so please, no more. 
</P>
<P>
Never pass a plate or bowl with your left hand, Scott admonished. The left hand 
is traditionally reserved for sanitary functions, and to use it when offering 
food or drink is the most base of insults. 
</P>
<P>
He advised Marines not to take any boom boxes and cassettes of rock 'n' roll 
music to Saudia Arabia, and the Marine Corps already has notified families not 
to send any photographs of nude or even semi-nude women to the men overseas -- 
including even pictures of wives and girlfriends clad in bathing suits -- 
because Middle Eastern culture won't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
So, will there be any fun to have in Saudia Arabia, the Marines wondered. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale, Welfare and Recreation is going to have a big job on its hands," Scott 
quipped. "We'll need to bring in some Universal gym equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Ken Johnson acknowledged after the half-hour briefing that he and 
his buddies were a little put off about the prospects for enjoying free time in 
Saudia Arabia, if they're destined there. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys are asking each other, 'What are we going to do with ourselves?' " he 
said. "I guess build sand castles."

PLEA BARGAIN EXPECTED IN SILBERMAN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a plea bargain expected to be made final in federal court today, financier 
Richard T. Silberman has agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of 
conspiring to launder cash portrayed to him as drug money, sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Silberman, 61, a former high-ranking state official, 
also will forgo an appeal on the sole count on which he was convicted in June 
after a two-month trial, a violation of federal currency laws, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain calls for Silberman to serve 41 to 50 months in federal prison, 
though U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving holds the final say on the length 
of Silberman's term, sources said. Silberman faced as much as 10 years in 
prison on his conviction and could have drawn up to 75 years in prison if he 
had been convicted on all the counts in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, disclosed without details late Thursday on Irving's schedule at the 
San Diego federal courthouse, would mark Silberman's first admission of guilt. 
Sources were reluctant to discuss details of the plea bargain because of a gag 
order in the case and because either side could back out before today's court 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest in a Mission Bay hotel in April, 1989, Silberman and his wife, 
San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, consistently had proclaimed his 
innocence on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was accused of directing a scheme to launder $300,000 that an 
undercover FBI agent had characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men were indicted along with Silberman, two of whom have already 
pleaded guilty to a single felony count. The plea bargain does not include the 
two others, including reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego, sources 
said. Both are scheduled to stand trial Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Thursday whether the bargain might call for Silberman to testify 
at Petti's trial. Jack Norman Myers, a Malibu investment banker accused of 
being a courier in the alleged laundering scheme, testified against Silberman 
after pleading guilty to a single criminal count. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the gag order imposed in the case by another judge but kept in effect by 
Irving, various lawyers -- including Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder 
Jr., the lead prosecutor and Silberman's attorney, James Brosnahan of San 
Francisco -- declined Thursday to comment on the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Golding could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The plea bargain frees prosecutors from the burden of a second trial, though 
they had announced their intent to retry Silberman. Last month, prosecutors had 
said they would seek to try Silberman and Petti together next month, a move 
that would have emphasized Silberman's links with the reputed mobster. 
</P>
<P>
In his trial, the jury deadlocked -- heavily favoring conviction -- on five 
counts, including two charges of money-laundering and the single count that 
accused Silberman of conspiring to launder money. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman faced as much as 10 years in federal prison on the single conviction, 
a technical charge of structuring a transaction to avoid the paper work that 
federal law requires for any cash transaction over $10,000. If convicted on all 
six counts that went to the jury, Silberman could have drawn as much as 75 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh count, which would have been Irving's to consider, is a criminal 
forfeiture charge through which prosecutors are seeking the return of the 
stocks, bonds and cash in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrest, prosecutors contended, Silberman already had done two laundering 
deals, using cash supplied by undercover FBI agent Peter Ahearn -- who was 
posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords -- and was 
negotiating with Ahearn to do a third. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a 
subsidiary of Silberman's gold-mining firm, Yuba Natural Resources. The second 
was a February, 1989, swap of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI, Silberman confessed as soon as he was arrested to 
laundering the $300,000 and said he was searching for funds to save his 
financially troubled mining firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to FBI notes of the alleged confession, Silberman offered upon arrest 
to implicate California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Chula Vista Councilman 
David Malcolm and several prominent businessmen in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, Malcolm and the others have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who served as former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s chief of staff and 
as secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency, among other positions, 
has been a key player in statewide Democratic politics since the 1970s. His 
son, Craig, works for Willie Brown in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also achieved great wealth in business, particularly in banking and 
fast food ventures. He was a general partner during the initial years of growth 
at the Jack in the Box restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
However, his most recent venture, San Diego-based Yuba Natural Resources, 
consistently had trouble paying its bills, according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial, Silberman testified that he thought the first deal was a 
legitimate stock sale in a Yuba subsidiary. He also said in court that he was 
coerced into the second deal by threats aimed at his family by a government 
informer, Robert Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy charge against Silberman, the count at the center of the plea 
bargain, alleges that Silberman believed the cash was drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the jury returned the sole guilty verdict on June 28, Irving 
sent Silberman to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San 
Diego, where he has remained. 
</P>
<P>
In light of Silberman's disappearance and apparent suicide attempt in Las Vegas 
in February, the prominent businessman had to be jailed because he could not 
show clearly that he would not flee.

NEW UNIVERSITY WINS ENDOWMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: $250,000 CHAIRS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND EARTH SCIENCE/GEOLOGY ARE 
DONATED TO CAL STATE SAN MARCOS BY TWO AREA BUSINESSMEN. 
</P>

<P>
Before opening its doors to students, Cal State San Marcos has received two 
endowed chairs from local businessmen who donated $250,000 each, university 
officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The donations will provide a faculty position in communications and another in 
earth science/geology, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The endowed chairs provide money for research and partial salary to help 
attract top professors. The two endowed chairs are impressive considering the 
infancy of the university and that the 19 other Cal State campuses have a 
combined total of 16 endowed chairs. The endowments bring to $750,000 the 
donations the university has received from private individuals and 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is honestly a tribute to the public support that the people in the area 
feel for the university," said university president Bill Stacy. 
</P>
<P>
The university had not intended to hire a geology or communications professor 
until the 1992 school year, but that is likely to change because of the 
donations, Stacy said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan O. Kelly, a resident of Carlsbad and self-educated geologist, endowed a 
chair to continue research into his theories of the earth's geological 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Daniels, chairman of Denver-based Daniels &amp; Associates and founder of 
Prime Ticket Network, a regional cable television sports network, donated the 
money toward a communications professorship. 
</P>
<P>
"He is making a statement that he is happy to support education," said Phil 
Urbina, a spokesman for the 70-year-old cable television pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Urbina said philanthropy is not new to Daniels, who donated $10 million to the 
University of Denver last year to integrate ethics courses into its business 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a lay geologist, has theories on how the Earth has developed and would 
like to see research into those theories, said K.C. Cordes, a spokesman for 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants somebody to carry on investigating and attempting to prove his 
theories in a scientific manner," Cordes said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has written two books on the "impact theory," a hypothesis that many 
Earth formations resulted from the impact of large space bodies, such as 
asteroids, hitting the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a terrible time getting acceptance within the geological field, 
partly because he's not from a geological background, and partly because people 
are so set in their ways," Cordes said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly will also donate his collection of geological writings and artifacts to 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
A search for professors to fill the two posts will begin this year, and 
university officials hope to have people in place for the 1991-92 school year. 
There are no geologists or communications professors on staff at Cal State San 
Marcos.

SAN DIEGO STAYS UNUSUALLY COOL AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS PREVAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The hot, muggy days of early August seem only a distant memory with the current 
trend toward cooler weather, according to the National Weather Service in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
August, normally the hottest month of the year has had 17 days out of 23 with 
temperatures below the norm of about 77 degrees at Lindbergh Field, said 
forecaster Dan Atkins. "We've had a rather persistent series of troughs and low 
pressure systems over the West Coast keeping temperatures down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today and the weekend look no different. Following the trend, the weather will 
be a little cooler because of a deepening marine layer, said Atkins. The layer 
of night and morning clouds is expected to persist with a slow clearing each 
afternoon. Only a partial clearing is expected at the beaches. The deep marine 
layer is caused by a low-pressure trough centered over western Canada and 
extending over the southwest United States. The trough will start weakening 
Sunday, and a warming trend will follow through the end of next week, Atkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the cloud cover and on-flow of marine air will keep 
temperatures a couple of degrees cooler than the norm of about 77, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches will range from 68 to 73, with a water temperature 
of 70 degrees. The surf will peak at 2 to 3 feet in 12-second intervals. 
Afternoon breezes will blow at 10 to 16 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs will range from 73 to 77 today and through the weekend, with 
nighttime lows of 64 to 69. Inland highs will range from 78 to 84, with lows of 
57 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountain, temperatures of 76 to 84 are expected, with lows of 44 to 52. 
The mercury in the desert will peak between 100 to 108 and dip down to 64 to 72 
at night.

STATE SEN. DEDDEH, IRAQI NATIVE, SUPPORTS BUSH'S MILITARY MOVES IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visibly anguished, state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) told his legislative 
colleagues Thursday that he backs President Bush's military actions in Iraq but 
urged him not to create "further enmity towards the United States in that part 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
After his Senate floor speech, Deddeh, who was born in Iraq, said in an 
interview that he's received several telephone threats because of his Iraqi 
background, but dismissed them as "crank calls." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh's remarks came during discussion over a Senate resolution calling on 
Californians to conserve energy through car-pooling and fuel-efficient vehicles 
to ease the nation's dependence on foreign oil during the current Mideast 
confrontation between Iraq and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in the Middle East is not going to be contained," said an 
emotional Deddeh, who grew up in Iraq before emigrating to America in 1947. He 
visited his native country on behalf of the Carter Administration in 1979 and 
was under consideration by the Reagan Administration for an ambassadorship to 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for us in the West, we are identified with the forces that are 
trying to stifle the rise of Arab nationalism. This is what concerns me," 
Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, while I pray for my President and support him, I hope we will not do 
anything that would create further enmity toward the United States in that part 
of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh said he fears for his 300 relatives living in Baghdad, which could be 
destroyed "within hours" by American forces. "A lot of innocent people will go, 
on both sides, unfortunately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that "a lot of Arab leaders would be destabilized" during the 
current crisis. But, despite his misgivings, Deddeh said he was supporting the 
resolution and Bush's actions so far. "In times of crisis, there is no 
Democrat, there is no Republican. We're all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
After his remarks, Deddeh was publicly commended by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) for expressing himself despite an "incredible number of threats, not 
only from his own area but from other parts of the state, because of his 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
After the remarks, Deddeh said he has received a "couple of crank calls from 
crackpots and a letter," but declined to discuss them further. "Just let it go 
at that. I don't want to escalate it or attract attention to it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MAN KILLED BY ROBBER WHILE WALKING TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South-Central Los Angeles man was robbed and fatally shot Thursday morning as 
he and his wife walked to work, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Donay Serrano, 29, was taken to USC County Medical Center where he 
underwent emergency surgery, police said. He died a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The couple was walking south on 42nd Street about 5 a.m. when a man jumped into 
their path and demanded money, Serrano's wife told police. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano gave the gunman one or two dollars, which prompted the robber to shove 
his handgun into Serrano's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
They struggled over the gun and the man shot Serrano in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman ran to a car, possibly a white Ford Escort, and drove away, police 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COCAINE SUSPECT, 46, FOUND DEAD IN JAIL 
CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 46-year-old man in custody on narcotics-related charges was found dead in his 
Parker Center jail cell Thursday and an autopsy was pending to determine how he 
died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A jailer discovered the man during a routine cell check about 3:30 p.m., Lt. 
William Hall said. Police declined to release the man's identity, pending 
notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
There were no obvious signs of trauma to the body, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not believe the man was involved in any arguments with 
jailers or any of the 14 other prisoners housed in the same cell area, Hall 
said. The man was arrested Wednesday in South-Central Los Angeles for allegedly 
trying to sell cocaine to undercover narcotics agents.

LAND COULD PROVE BARRIER TO MIGRANT HIRING HALL; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS: THE NEW ENCINITAS COMMUNITY ACTION BOARD COULD REFUSE TO RENEW A 
LAND-USE PERMIT. IF THAT HAPPENS, THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS IT MIGHT RECONSIDER ITS 
SUPPORT OF THE EMBATTLED OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Encinitas city officials said Thursday that the future of their embattled 
migrant hiring hall is still cloudy, despite a council decision to extend its 
funding for another six months. In a unanimous decision, the council Wednesday 
earmarked $34,150 for continued operation of the hall -- a portable mobile home 
on a rural stretch of El Camino Real at Olivenhain Road. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, however, the city's land-use permit for the parcel of private 
property expires. And, if the New Encinitas Community Action Board follows its 
predictions by refusing to renew the permit, the city will be forced to find a 
new site for its hall. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, according to Councilwoman Gail Hano, the council would reconsider 
its backing for the hiring hall, the first of its kind in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been given six more months," said Gloria Carranza, the city's transients 
issues coordinator. "But we still have some real barriers along the way." 
</P>
<P>
Carranza said her office will try to place the hiring hall issue on the 
community action board's Sept. 17 agenda and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several possible steps to renewing the OK for the hall," she said. 
"From the community action board, it goes to the city Planning Commission and 
then the council. If anyone votes it down, our office will appeal the matter to 
the next higher group." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the council also approved funding for Carranza's $56,650 annual 
salary for the next fiscal year as well as $40,000 for a program in which the 
city would help shoulder the cleanup costs for residents living near migrant 
encampments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting criticism of the hall, which seeks to find employment in the 
community for documented workers, Carranza said people are landing jobs through 
the controversial program, which began last November. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 53% -- or 27 -- of the 53 people who use the hall on 
average each day find work. On Thursday, the day after the council's decision, 
53 of 64 workers who showed up at the site landed a day job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Hano on Thursday, however, asked at what price the city is helping 
documented workers find work. She said the city has at least two other sites in 
mind if the community action board votes down the present location on land 
owned by the Hunt Bros. developers of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
One of those, she said, is property owned by local poinsettia grower Paul Ecke, 
situated directly across El Camino Real from the present site. The second site, 
which she declined to specify, is publicly owned. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the community action board turning it down," Hano said. "It was 
supposed to be a temporary use of that property, and there's worry that it's 
becoming permanent. Unfortunately, the NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) factor comes 
into play as well." 
</P>
<P>
A negative vote from the community action board could spell disaster for the 
fledgling hiring hall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're forced to move the hall, then I'm taking my vote for continued 
funding back," Hano said. "Because, if we have to clear new property, the 
operating costs will go up." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Patton, chairwoman of the New Encinitas Community Action Board, said 
Thursday she couldn't comment on which direction the board might take. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant advocates, many of whom have been critical of the hiring hall's scope 
of only helping documented workers, say they aren't holding their breath to see 
how the matter turns out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never terribly enthusiastic about that place to begin with," said the 
Rev. Rafael Martinez, executive director of North County Chaplaincy, an 
Encinitas-based migrant group. 
</P>
<P>
By catering only to documented workers "the hall isn't doing the work it could 
do. To separate documented people from the undocumented is the work of the 
Border Patrol, not the job of a municipality," he said.

VISIT BY THEATER COMPANY A TRIUMPH OF PERESTROIKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while, the visiting actors and theater directors from Leningrad answered 
questions through an interpreter about the differences between Soviet and 
American theater and whether censorship has become a casualty of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Soviets and the Americans who posed all of the questions mingled 
over wine and a lavish buffet, talking -- albeit with translators as 
intermediaries -- the way everybody seems to talk at parties. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the thespians from the East and the art patrons from the West 
had a better understanding of each others' cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come to find out if the stories and dreams about America are true, and 
also to show you who they are," said Bill Raiten, director of the New Surrey 
Theatre in Maine, who sparked the American visit by the 48 Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The tour began nearly a month ago on the East Coast, reaching the South Bay 
this week where it will end. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets were welcomed in Rolling Hills Estates on Wednesday at a reception 
at the Norris Theatre for the Performing Arts, where they are presenting a 
Soviet Theatre Festival that includes one-act plays, Russian vaudeville and 
jazz Soviet-style. The festival runs through Sunday night. The plays are in 
Russian, with an English synopsis preceding each one. 
</P>
<P>
The performers come from two Leningrad theater companies -- the Komedy Theatre 
and the St. Petersburg Theatre -- as well as the Leningrad Dixieland Jazz Club, 
the Soviet Union's only club offering American Dixieland and swing. 
</P>
<P>
In the discussion at Wednesday's reception, the Soviets said actors in their 
country and Americans share one thing in common: a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Komedy Theatre director Yuri Gubanov said the biggest difference between 
American and Soviet theater is the repertory system. His company of actors 
perform 20 plays in rotation during a season, while American theaters typically 
perform single plays in lengthy runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets saw a long-running play after arriving in New York, prompting 
Gubanov to remark, "I'm amazed that an actor playing in the same play for so 
long a period of time is so professional, good and excited every night." 
</P>
<P>
But while the 60-year-old Komedy Theatre follows a traditional Russian 
theatrical mode -- with a single artistic director often shaping all 
productions -- the 2-year-old St. Petersburg Theatre is doing things 
differently, said the company's Eugene Lukoshkov. 
</P>
<P>
Directors from other countries are being used to bring new and different 
perspectives to his theater. "Casts get used to a director and know what to 
expect. They lose interest," he said, describing one of his reasons for 
departing from the more traditional ways. 
</P>
<P>
On the question of censorship, Gubanov said perestroika put an end to it three 
years ago. "You can do any play the theater wants," he said. "It's even 
possible for actors and actresses to undress on the stage now." 
</P>
<P>
This new spirit allowed the Komedy Theatre's successful production in Leningrad 
of Bulgakhov's "Zoykhin's Apartment," which was banned for nearly 60 years 
because of its criticism of the government. Scenes from the play are being done 
at the Norris. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet visit germinated from Raiten's working last year at the Komedy 
Theatre, where he directed three American plays -- in Russian. He was impressed 
by the actors and the success of the plays. "I said, 'Why can't I get you 
people to come to America?,' and they said it would never happen because they 
had no money," he recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the actors raised their own money for the trip to America. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, airlines and hotels in the United States have given them 
discounts, and they have stayed in private homes. The Soviets performed several 
times in Maine and in New Brunswick, Canada, before arriving in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Norris' Soviet Festival was an act of serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten, who is directing a coming production of "Fiddler on the Roof," was 
looking in the spring for a theater where it could be performed. 
</P>
<P>
The Norris was recommended, and while discussing it with theater Managing 
Director Peter Lesnik, Raiten mentioned the Soviet tour. Lesnik suggested they 
play at the Norris, and call it a Soviet Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like something the community would really enjoy," Lesnik said. "From 
the geopolitical point of view, it seems like the right time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Fiddler" will play at the Norris Oct. 18 through 21, then travel to Leningrad 
for six performances between Nov. 24 and Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets talked primarily about theater at the reception, some also 
shared feelings about their month in the United States. Irina Tsvetkova said 
she has been impressed by the families she has stayed with. "Americans have 
open hearts and are open to discuss things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gubanov had an observation that at first seemed focused on Los Angeles, but he 
applied it to the East Coast as well. The United States, he said, is a 
hospitable but fast-tempo sort of place where "people seem to live in their 
cars."

THE MAXIMUM IN TRANSIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUS SERVICE CATCHES ON WITH EL SEGUNDO AEROSPACE COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When the MAX buses started rolling four months ago, planners weren't sure quite 
what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
The new transit system was founded on the premise that at least 200 commuters a 
day would willingly leave their cars at home and take buses north to the 
aerospace industries in and around El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Still, transportation planners say, the introduction of any new mass transit 
project is a risky affair. 
</P>
<P>
So supporters of MAX are quietly cheering the latest ridership reports, which 
show as many as 2,275 people boarding buses each week on the system's three 
routes, which were projected to carry 2,198 riders a week. That means about 225 
people are riding the bus round-trip every day. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we should be right on target," said Robert W. Hildebrand, 
program manager for MAX, formally known as the Municipal Area Express. But he 
injected a note of caution: "The service is still new. Talk to me next January. 
We'll see where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Although overall ridership is strong, one of the system's three routes is 
carrying fewer people than planners had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
On the so-called "beach cities" route closest to the coast, some buses are 
running less than one-quarter full. Route changes are being considered in hopes 
of bolstering ridership; a public hearing on proposed changes will be held this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
MAX is targeted to serve workers in the aerospace industry, and employers are 
clearly pleased.

"Our people are making very good reports about it," said James B. Ardis, 
director of human resources at the Radar Systems Group of Hughes Aircraft Co. 
"People really do feel that it's a special, tailor-made thing to meet their 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes employees have praised the airline-style seats, commuter-oriented routes 
and drivers' helpfulness, Ardis said. "It's not just 'riding the bus.' There's 
more of a social experience to it than you might think." 
</P>
<P>
A TRW official also commended MAX's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It arrives at the time our people need the system. They ride to Space Park in 
comfort and without fighting all the traffic and the hassle," said William 
Wells, transportation department manager for the TRW General Services 
Division's space and defense section. 
</P>
<P>
MAX is a joint project of nine South Bay cities and Los Angeles County. Its 
first buses began running April 18 on lines taken from three older bus routes. 
</P>
<P>
The line serving San Pedro -- the most popular to date -- is MAX Line 3, 
formerly Rapid Transit District Line 686 and later a Los Angeles Commuter 
Express line. The line that begins in Rancho Palos Verdes, MAX Line 2, 
resembles the former RTD Line 685. And the beach cities line, MAX Line 1, 
serves some of the same areas as Herman, the old Hermosa-Manhattan Commuter 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The project has a first-year operating budget of $940,000, with fare revenues 
estimated at $127,000. Half of the remaining funds are supplied by a 
Proposition A demonstration grant from the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, which will decrease over the next three years. The rest comes from 
local cities' share of Proposition A money. 
</P>
<P>
MAX buses run every 20 minutes during morning and afternoon rush-hour periods. 
The buses make six trips north on each route each weekday morning, and eight 
trips south each night. The extra evening trips are needed because employees' 
departures from work are scattered over a longer period of time than their 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Cash fares vary from $1.25 to $1.50, according to zone. Monthly passes are 
available for $45 or $54, and some employers offer subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
MAX is especially popular among TRW employees, who constituted the largest 
group of commuters in a recent survey. Employees from two Hughes groups -- 
Space and Communications, and Radar Systems -- each made up 12% of MAX riders. 
The U.S. Air Force accounted for 10%, followed by Xerox at 8%, Aerospace Corp. 
at 8%, and Hughes Electro-Optical and Data Systems Group at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
MAX organizers are monitoring the current debate over the possible departure of 
the 3,200-employee Air Force Space Systems Division from El Segundo. If the 
division moves, the 4,000-employee Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, a nonprofit 
think tank that works closely with the space division, might also be lost, and 
MAX ridership could be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working very hard trying to keep the Air Force base here," said El 
Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson, vice president of the MAX Policy Steering 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the slow growth of the beach cities line, planners are surveying 
commuters about possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that the line duplicates only a portion of an earlier bus line, 
Hildebrand said. "Therefore, we're just kind of starting from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach Mayor Roger Creighton added: "People who live in Hermosa and 
Manhattan are that close to the (El Segundo) employment center that they jump 
in their cars and drive." 
</P>
<P>
One idea being discussed is to reroute the beach cities line in El Segundo to 
speed up service to TRW. Planners are also looking into creating a 
park-and-ride lot at Riviera United Methodist Church in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro line may also be extended to serve an Air Force housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
Those ideas and others will be reviewed at a public hearing at 5 p.m. Oct. 8 at 
Xerox Corp. in El Segundo. Changes would have to be approved by the MAX policy 
committee.

OPPONENTS SEEK VETO OF COUNTY'S EXEMPTION TO AIRPORT GROWTH LAW; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL EXEMPTING L.A. COUNTY FROM GROWTH 
RESTRICTIONS. FOES ARGUE THAT PLANNING IS NEEDED FOR AIR SAFETY.

<P>
Opponents of a bill exempting Los Angeles County from a new law aimed at 
controlling growth around California's airports are launching a last-ditch 
effort to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, the city of Los Angeles and an airport advisory panel created by the 
Legislature all plan to recommend a veto of the bill, which is bound for 
Deukmejian's desk after clearing the Assembly on Wednesday on a 51-18 vote. The 
measure passed the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), would exempt the 
county from a 7-month-old law that puts teeth into statutes designed to ensure 
that new development is compatible with the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Without the exemption, far-reaching regulations could be placed on development 
near Los Angeles International Airport, as well as airports in other parts of 
the county, including Santa Monica, Torrance, Hawthorne and Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The law that took effect earlier this year requires regional land use plans to 
be drafted for property surrounding the state's airports by June 30, 1991 -- 
except in Los Angeles County, which won an extension until Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In counties that fail to meet the deadline, citizens can file lawsuits to block 
development within a mile of an airport's runways. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Beverly's bill to give Los Angeles County a complete exemption 
from the land-use law say the county is special because in all but a few cases, 
the land around its airports is already densely developed. Led by the Los 
Angeles County branch of the League of California cities, the supporters also 
object that the law will force cities to yield to a countywide airport planning 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly says he expects such arguments to carry weight with Deukmejian. 
"There's been some modest opposition, but I feel confident he'll sign it," the 
senator said. 
</P>
<P>
But foes of an exemption for Los Angeles County argue that regional airport 
planning is needed to promote air safety and minimize the exposure of homes and 
businesses to aircraft noise. They say such problems have led to the closure or 
conversion to private use of 18 airports in the state during the last 10 years 
-- a time of growing demand for air service. 
</P>
<P>
Among those planning to make these arguments to Deukmejian are the California 
Department of Transportation, the California Commission on Aviation and 
Airports and the city of Los Angeles, which wants planning mechanisms in place 
as it moves to develop a public airport in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants an airport in their back yard," said Anne Blue, one of the city 
of Los Angeles' lobbyists in Sacramento. "So if you leave this planning up to 
the local governments, they're going to be responsive to their constituents and 
limit the expansion and siting of airports."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO DISCUSS SUIT OVER DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council will hold a special meeting today to discuss and 
possibly reconsider its recent decision to sue the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to block a 2,555-unit housing tract in the Stevenson Ranch 
development west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, Mayor Jo Anne Darcy called the meeting so the council can 
discuss the potential impact of a lawsuit, particularly on plans by the Newhall 
School District to build schools near the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held at 4 p.m. in the council chambers at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In return for county approval of its project, Dale Poe Development Corp. has 
promised to donate a 13-acre school site and $2.4 million to the school 
district. School officials have said they are concerned that a lawsuit could 
delay construction of new schools in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to file the lawsuit last week on grounds that the 
environmental impact report for the project was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit will be discussed in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
In the public portion of the meeting, the council will review its recent 
appointments to the Parks and Recreation Commission. The council has come under 
fire for using a numerical ranking system to make appointments. Critics said 
the system unfairly led to the ouster of incumbent Laurene Weste, who was the 
only commissioner not reappointed this month.

WEEKENDER: SOCIABLE AT BANNING MANSION IS A CHANCE FOR VISITORS TO TURN BACK 
THE CLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually, when people visit the sumptuous Phineas Banning mansion in Wilmington, 
it's on a tour: A well-informed guide tells them all about the founder of 
Wilmington, who built the house in 1864 and lived there with his family. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday afternoon, visitors to the home and its lush grounds may find 
themselves feeling a little like a Banning guest on a tranquil afternoon more 
than 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek Revival house, with its spacious rooms and heirloom furnishings, will 
be open as usual. But a woman will be seated on the back porch snapping beans, 
and someone will be playing a dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
On the tree-shaded grounds, a blacksmith will be at work; clog dancers will 
perform Appalachian dances, and a barbershop quartet will harmonize. The way 
people in the 19th Century made such treats as ice cream and such necessities 
as quilts, soap and rope will be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"An Old-Fashioned Summer Sociable," as the event is called, is meant to show 
what life was like when the mansion was a family home, according to Julia 
Heard, who heads the Banning Residence Museum's volunteers and is chairman of 
the event. "We want to show that this was a living house, not a museum," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Famous for what they called their "entertainments," the Bannings enjoyed 
inviting people to their estate and sometimes had dancing and musicians in 
front of the house, Heard said. This was the era of ranching, and guests came 
from long distances, sometimes staying overnight in the house or in tents 
pitched on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's sociable won't be quite as long as the Banning entertainments were, 
but museum volunteers -- some of them dressed in period clothes -- plan to 
squeeze a lot of events into three hours. There'll even be a tribute to the 
patriarch himself. Banning would have turned 160 last Sunday, and the event 
will be celebrated with cake and a round of "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Besides watching demonstrations of homemaking in the last century, visitors can 
try their hand at a few things. They can make rope, soap and clothespin dolls; 
crank ice cream, churn butter, and wash clothes on a scrub-board. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the lawn, children may entertain themselves with such 19th-Century games 
as rolling barrel hoops with a stick, shooting marbles, engaging in egg and 
spoon races and playing pin the tail on the donkey. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the mansion, a collection of 18 quilts, all made before 1900, will be 
shown on beds and draped across chairs, as they might have been when the home 
was lived in. Victorian hats also will be on view. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the big door of the Banning carriage house -- which still has 
its horse stalls and original sturdy floor -- visitors will encounter 10 
meticulously restored carriages, buggies and carts. Included is an authentic 
surrey with the fringe on top. According to Heard, the fringe was not for 
decoration -- it kept the bugs away. 
</P>
<P>
Don Blanks, a blacksmith and carriage restorer, spent a year and a half getting 
the vehicles to look as if they were made yesterday. He'll be giving the 
smithing demonstration Sunday, making cowbells and harness hooks, and relating 
the history of smithing as he works. 
</P>
<P>
The blacksmith was one of the most important people in town when horse-drawn 
wagons and plows reigned supreme, Blanks said. "In small towns, he was sent for 
before the doctor was. If the wheels don't roll, the farmer can't farm. He was 
the fix-it man of the 1900s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday's old-fashioned sociable is the first one that the Banning museum 
has sponsored, and there are plans to make it an annual party. The museum has 
wanted to hold a summer event and was encouraged by the success of its annual 
Victorian Christmas, which usually draws about 1,500 people. That kind of 
turnout is not expected for a brand-new event, but the museum is hoping for up 
to 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
Heard said: "We want people to go away thinking what life was like in the 19th 
Century, yet to know how many traditions we are carrying on, such as the family 
getting together and doing chores together." GERALD FARIS

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CANES MAKES MOST OF 'UPTOWN' MASHED POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George and Piret Munger's new eatery is called Canes, which gives a quick idea 
of the sort of item that George Munger, who does limp on occasion (but stoutly 
denies that he suffers from gout), has spent some time collecting. Canes may 
constitute a curious and novel motif for a restaurant, or for a "California 
bistro," as this place bills itself, but groupings of them hang at regular 
intervals on the walls, rather like coats of arms in an Old English pub. 
</P>
<P>
Most have carved handles that resemble ducks, dog's heads and other, more 
arcane representations; one delightful piece displayed above the bar extends 
into a fishing pole, a practical device indeed for the country gentleman 
afflicted with lumbago. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the place has nothing to do with the decorations, however, even 
though Canes abounds in them, with many fine architectural studies of classical 
buildings hung among the canes, and canvas table tops painted in vague, bright 
patterns that, by intention or otherwise, seem a throwback to the street art of 
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
To grasp the essence of Canes, it is necessary to work through an equation 
whose solution is mashed potatoes. These highly seasoned, almost 
elastic-textured spuds appear repeatedly and underscore the rugged, hard-edged 
tone of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
These might be called "uptown" mashed potatoes, and they illuminate the manner 
in which Canes' avant-garde look relates to its setting in the new Uptown 
District development in Hillcrest, a kind of instant urban neighborhood that 
imitates streets in New York and San Francisco by locating restaurants and 
shops on the ground floors of residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
To tie into this environment, the Mungers have designed an instant neighborhood 
cafe that combines simple but aggressively flavored cooking with moderate 
prices and a trendy, uptown atmosphere. The menu repeats from lunch to dinner 
and most entree-sized items are priced below $10. 
</P>
<P>
The Canes menu does share some items with Piret's and PiretM, the Mungers' 
signature restaurants in La Jolla Village Square and Encinitas, but is by no 
means a carbon. It fires its opening shot with focaccia, or roasted 
country-style bread served with a sauce of cheese, tomato, olives and garlic, 
hurries along to a likeable roulade of sliced eggplant rolled around sun-dried 
tomatoes and feta cheese and shoots another salvo with mashed potatoes cloaked 
in cheese sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Canes almost certainly is the only local restaurant to offer mashed potatoes as 
an appetizer; rather less unusual are such choices as prosciutto and grilled 
scallops in a roasted pepper sauce, a soup of tomato and bread and klodniak, a 
cold soup of Baltic origin that combines shrimp, cucumber and buttermilk. A 
chicken salad dressed with yogurt, melon and nuts and a grilled chicken breast 
with greens and vegetables serve as light entrees. All pastas and entrees 
include an excellent house salad of greens dressed with chopped bacon, nuts, 
olives and sharp and mild cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive selection of designer pizzas, all with one or more cheeses, goes 
as far as a cabbage and pancetta (belly bacon) combo, but also includes George 
Munger's favorite, a traditional pepperoni pie that, when ordered cold (two 
slices for $3), takes on the name "breakfast pizza." Other choices include a 
tomato-less "white" pizza garnished with garlic and olive oil; a combination of 
grilled, marinated beef with peppers and onions, and a novelty garnished with 
stewed chicken and sun-dried tomatoes that would taste a little less like a hot 
chicken sandwich without gravy were the tomatoes more generously apportioned. 
</P>
<P>
By modern definition, a restaurant of this sort must not only offer plenty of 
pasta choices, but at least several unusual ones. In this category would be 
such things as the "tequila chicken" pasta with hot and sweet peppers, and 
linguine with grilled lamb and sun-dried tomatoes. The spaghetti with garlic, 
sausage and roasted peppers -- to which daredevils may add anchovies for an 
extra 50 cents -- is more in the mainstream, as are the penne with garlic and 
Gorgonzola cheese, the pasta primavera, here topped with roasted vegetables, 
and the spaghetti with a strong, zesty sauce of fresh tomatoes, basil and much 
garlic. Garlic, peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and anchovies are recurring accents 
on this menu, which makes quite a point of sharp, direct, unequivocal flavors. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list leads off with sandwiches, including a rather nice barbecued 
beef on a sesame seed bun that features a fine, tangy sauce, a crab salad with 
avocado on nut bread and a steak sandwich dressed with onion confit, a sort of 
marmalade of lengthily stewed sliced onions. The hot dishes on the whole strike 
the most conservative note on the menu, although this is inconsistent: The 
listing of chicken breast in an orange-and-mustard-flavored cream sauce is 
followed by grilled marinated shrimp in a spicy, Thai-inspired sauce, served to 
the wonder of the world on a bed of mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
A plate of roast chicken basted with lemon had little character, and the cubed, 
vaguely herbed red potatoes that joined it seemed to have been stewed, a 
procedure that did them no great favor. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled pork tenderloin seemed rather expertly done, however, and had a 
crusted exterior set off by a slightly pink, very moist center; a large 
spoonful of apricot chutney made an excellent garnish. 
</P>
<P>
The Flemish beef stew was in some ways the most interesting entree sampled. 
This traditional dish calls for meat and onions to be braised in beer for 
hours; the result is an unbelievably rich product in which shredded meat and 
melted onion are nearly indistinguishable. The stew was very good, but siding 
it with the ubiquitous and also exceedingly rich mashed potatoes turned the 
plate into too much of a good thing -- the items were overwhelmingly alike in 
both texture and richness. 
</P>
<P>
An outside supplier caters the bulk of the dessert tray, although the house 
does make a smooth creme brulee and offers a couple of ice cream fantasies -- a 
"trifle" dressed with Grand Marnier and assorted berries, and a combination of 
vanilla ice cream, Scotch and espresso coffee named "Marcella Hazan's ice 
cream" in honor of the Italian cookbook author. 
</P>
<P>
The wine list generally runs with the inexpensive neighborhood character of the 
place and presents one of the best moderate-priced selections in town. However, 
inveterate collector George Munger was unable to resist one very downtown 
gesture and stocked the bar with a remarkable selection of Cognacs, Armagnacs 
(there is even a 1935 Loubere at $28 a snifter) and other grand liqueurs; most 
cost well under $10 the glass.

<P>
A 92-year-old North Hollywood man apparently shot his 42-year-old maid to death 
Thursday and then killed himself, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Shirley Lynn Keever and Ben Walter Schwartz were found at 2:15 
p.m. by officers responding to a report of shots being fired at an apartment 
house in the 6300 block of Whitsett Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're calling it a murder-suicide," said Sgt. Tom Toutant. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz apparently shot Keever several times in the upper torso and then shot 
himself once in the head with a .38-caliber semiautomatic pistol, Detective 
David Alfred said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found about 10 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives had not determined the cause of the shooting, but neighbors reported 
that the two argued shortly before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was loud enough to where the neighbors were hearing them yelling at each 
other," Alfred said. 
</P>
<P>
Keever had been living in the apartment with Schwartz for about two months. 
Neighbors reported hearing loud arguments between the two on previous 
occasions, Alfred said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Schwartz had lived in the apartment for 2 1/2 years.

MARY E. KEATS; RETIRED MGM HAIR STYLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary E. Keats of Van Nuys, who was manager of the hair styling department at 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios for a decade, has died at the Motion Picture and 
Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Born Mary Webster in New Jersey, she died Saturday of complications of 
diabetes, said her nephew, Grant Webster, whom she raised. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Van Nuys for 29 years, Ms. Keats came to California in the early 
1940s and began working as a hair stylist for MGM in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, she became manager of the department until it closed in 1969. Ms. 
Keats worked on a free-lance basis for movie studios and television until her 
retirement in 1984. Through the years, she worked with many celebrities, 
including Elvis Presley, Eva Marie Saint, Liza Minnelli, Debbie Reynolds, 
Luciano Pavarotti and Burt Reynolds. She also traveled with Bob Hope during the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by sisters Sylvia Schenck of Cathedral City, Calif., and Rae 
Callahaghan, Lucille Bracall and Diane Webster, all of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
A graveside service will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. at Pierce Brothers Valhalla 
in North Hollywood, which handled the arrangements.

'MISS SAIGON' CASTING FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Actors' Equity changed its mind ("Actors' Equity Says White Can Portray 
Eurasian," Part A, Aug. 17). Big Deal! One must wonder what's become of us when 
the matter of perceived racial discrimination in the casting of Broadway shows, 
not to mention hiring on other fronts, becomes a fanatical preoccupation among 
those whose time and energies should be put to more productive use. 
</P>
<P>
The "Miss Saigon" flap is an excruciatingly embarrassing symbol of misplaced 
U.S. priorities. Why must overblown causes such as these supersede the struggle 
to correct our nation's seemingly forgotten failings such as deterioration of 
our national work ethic and the declining quality of our goods and services? 
</P>
<P>
Producer Cameron Mackintosh's cancellation of his show is a proud reminder to 
all of us that hiring the most qualified, efficient and hard-driving person for 
the job, any job, is the paramount issue, and that the choice must be at the 
discretion of the employer, not the employee. It's more important than ever 
during these days when America must play second fiddle to other countries whose 
people are more intent on creating the best product and service. 
</P>
<P>
How much longer will protesters ignore that we're beset with serious economic 
problems and national recession? Legitimate civil rights issues 
notwithstanding, the arrogance and destructive tactics used by militant job 
seekers must give way to common sense, the plain and simple matter of economics 
and the right of private entrepreneurs to operate their businesses at optimum 
levels.

BALLPARK NEWSPAPER VENDOR MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police are looking for a 51-year-old mentally retarded man who has 
been missing since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald G. Bruner, who sells newspapers at San Diego Padres games at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, was last seen by the manager of the downtown hotel where 
he lives, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner is described as 5-foot-11, 120 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
His county social worker had been trying to reach Bruner for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
"He walks up and down the aisles selling newspapers," Robinson said. "Then, 
when he sells them all, the crowd applauds and he raises his hands in 
exultation."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old man was injured when someone threw a fire bomb into his back 
yard, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur R. Mason Jr. of Escondido was treated for burns on his right leg at 
Palomar Hospital and released, said Paul Bledsoe, an arson explosives 
investigator for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have no suspects and are not releasing any information about 
possible motives for Wednesday night's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Mason was working on a water sprinkler system in his back yard when he saw a 
flaming object being thrown into the yard, Bledsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that whoever threw the fire bomb probably was parked along 
Via Rancho Parkway, near Mason's home in the 700 block of Quiet Place. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the incident is asked to call arson investigators at 
692-5620.

'FAIR CONTRACT' URGED FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The continued freedom from the invasions of rampant crime and violence is at 
stake in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Few cities in Los Angeles County actually have the sense of security that we in 
Torrance have. 
</P>
<P>
However, these freedoms can be taken away quickly if we do not invest our 
monies and resources in the people who protect this fine city and its liberty. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women of the Torrance police force are directly responsible for the 
high quality of life that we enjoy daily. They are willing to put their lives 
on the line so that Torrance can be the haven that it is day after day. During 
this time the police officers are negotiating with the city for a new pay and 
benefit contract, I ask that the City Council in their wisdom will recognize 
the commitment of these men and women and give them a fair and adequate 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
I want our city to pay the price it takes to ensure the freedoms we still have.

HARBOR PANEL OKS PERMIT TO RAZE OLD WILMINGTON CANNERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Commission on Wednesday approved a permit allowing 
demolition of the old Heinz pet food cannery in Wilmington amid complaints that 
the building's most historically valued equipment was not passed on to the 
community as promised. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council abandoned plans to designate the 
cannery, at 545 S. Fries Ave., a historical and cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, at the urging of Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, city lawmakers called 
for the port to provide Wilmington with a new waterfront museum or plaza. 
</P>
<P>
But several Wilmington residents complained Wednesday that the cannery's 
equipment, including a conveyor, was sold by Heinz to a salvage company before 
residents had an opportunity to tour the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The residents blamed the loss on port officials who, they said, led them to 
believe that Heinz would donate to the community what residents wanted, not 
just what was left after the building was stripped. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the Harbor Department never saw the historical value 
of the cannery," said Olivia Cueva-Fernandez, whose mother and grandmother 
worked at the cannery. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials countered that they have set aside items from the cannery that 
were pointed out by several residents who toured it June 13. And regardless of 
what might have been there before the tour, port spokesman Chuck Ellis said, 
the Harbor Department has no authority to order a tenant to turn over property 
it owns.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: AMID SLIDE, FEAR GRIPS INVESTORS; IS LOATHING NEXT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southland brokers say individual investors are showing the first signs of panic 
selling as the stock market continues to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Some brokers fear a huge drop in prices today, as more investors decide to exit 
rather than risk seeing their stocks fall another 20% or more in a severe bear 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a rush of selling at the close" Thursday, said Larry Rice, manager 
of over-the-counter stock trading at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. 
"That probably means it's going to be a rocky opening" today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Merrill Lynch broker in Los Angeles, who asked that his name not be used, 
admitted that Thursday was the first day since the Mideast crisis began that he 
got calls from clients expressing concern and wondering aloud whether they 
should sell. 
</P>
<P>
He also said trading-oriented customers who have bought stock on credit, or 
"margin," are being forced to liquidate their positions to repay the loans, 
adding to selling pressure. 
</P>
<P>
At other brokerages, too, many clients' attitude toward the market has quickly 
shifted. For weeks, the feeling has been that the market would soon stabilize, 
despite mounting concerns over the economy and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
But as stocks have fallen relentlessly -- many are down 40% or more since 
mid-July -- more investors have come to see the frightening specter of a 
prolonged bear market. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the desire to flee stocks is rising sharply, causing anxiety even for 
investors who had considered themselves long-term holders. 
</P>
<P>
To some experts, however, investor complacency overall is still too high. Not 
until many more stockholders decide to sell can the market reach a bottom, some 
say, and that could still be months away. Even so, panic clearly is beginning 
to grip the market: 
</P>
<P>
* "We had a surge of selling early (Thursday) morning," said Bob Reed, 
executive vice president of discount brokerage Jack White &amp; Co. in San 
Diego. "There were a lot of people saying, 'I want to sell everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Frank Masselli, assistant branch manager at Paine Webber Group's downtown Los 
Angeles office, said some of his brokers reported Thursday that their clients 
were suddenly bailing out. "We're fighting hard to get them to hang on," said 
Masselli, who argues that there are "some very strong companies now selling at 
dirt-cheap prices." 
</P>
<P>
* At discount brokerage Charles Schwab &amp; Co.'s Century City office, manager 
Nancy Ybarra said she's taking calls from "a lot of people saying, 'I just 
don't know what's going on, but I'm not comfortable.' " 
</P>
<P>
The panic isn't yet universal, however. Some brokers report that their clients 
are eager to jump into the market, given that many stocks are at their lowest 
prices in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"My own clients have been heavy buyers of high-quality blue chips," said Lynn 
Reitnouer, partner at Crowell Weedon &amp; Co.'s downtown Los Angeles office. 
His customers are snapping up such stocks as Philip Morris, Anheuser-Busch, 
Heinz and Sara Lee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, at the Woodland Hills office of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, 
manager Rocky Mills says he's seeing a "surprising number of green tickets." 
Client buy orders are written on green tickets; pink tickets are for sell 
orders. Looking at the day's orders piled on his desk Thursday, Mills said, the 
green and pink tickets "look about equal." 
</P>
<P>
Reitnouer said buyers are motivated by memories of stocks' relatively fast 
rebound after the 1987 crash. "They saw the result of 1987, and I think this is 
very similar" to that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many analysts say it's dangerous to assume the market will repeat the 1987 
experience. The oldest rule about the stock market is that it will do whatever 
is necessary to make fools out of the majority of investors. After the 1987 
crash, most people thought a depression was coming and that stocks would plunge 
further. Instead, the market quickly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the majority apparently wants to believe that this market turbulence 
will blow over, that the economy won't go into recession, and that the Mideast 
crisis will be resolved favorably for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Larchmont, N.Y., Investors Intelligence newsletter's latest weekly poll of 
130 investment advisers shows that while 48.0% now are bearish, 33.1% still are 
bullish and 18.9% say the market is merely in a correction. That means the 
majority believe stocks will soon go higher. 
</P>
<P>
History suggests the bearish reading must go much higher before the market can 
bottom. Just after the market low in late January of this year, the bears 
totaled 57.3%. The highest reading was 60.9% in March, 1982 -- five months 
before the last bull market began. 
</P>
<P>
While there's little argument on Wall Street that many stocks have been beaten 
mercilessly, and that many may now be bargains, it's also a fact that bear 
markets are rarely over in 30 days -- which is about how long this one has gone 
on, measuring from the Dow Jones industrial average peak in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
You could pick up stocks at good prices now, compared to where they might be a 
year from now. But you might be able to get them for even less in the weeks and 
months ahead, if the bear psychology indeed has yet to peak. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, bear markets have ranged from six to eight months in length to as 
long as 21 months. There frequently are rallies within bear markets, but they 
don't last long. So even while some analysts insist the market will rally at 
the first sign of a U.S. victory in the Mideast or substantial peace 
negotiations, many experts say the deepening gloom in the market suggests the 
rallies ultimately will just bring out more sellers. 
</P>
<P>
That has been the case so far. "After the market rallied (Thursday) morning, it 
couldn't hold," said Frank Baxter, president of Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies 
&amp; Co., which mainly caters to institutional investors. "Fear prevails." 
</P>
<P>
If that sentiment continues to build, it could lead to a speculative blow-off 
that could take the Dow Jones industrial average down several hundred points in 
one day, some analysts say. With the "circuit breakers" now in place, trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange would be halted for one hour if the Dow falls 
250 points. Upon reopening, if the Dow falls to a total daily loss of 400 
points, trading would be halted again, this time for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors wish the market would take that big hit, wash out the last of 
the sellers, and give the value-hunters a chance to begin rebuilding the 
market's confidence, bit by bit. 
</P>
<P>
But if the market does what it usually does -- confound the majority -- the big 
hit may never come. Instead, the selling could continue for months, in small 
amounts day by day, just as was typical in previous bear markets. 
</P>
<P>
After the bull market of the 1980s, when investors came to believe that stocks 
only went up, the ratcheting-down of prices over many months "would be a new 
experience for 70% of the people in the market," Baxter says. 
</P>
<P>
That would be precisely the kind of lesson the market loves to teach its 
players. 
</P>
<P>

Auto Contract Proposals Made: The United Auto Workers union considered the 
first comprehensive contract proposals from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor 
Co., and waited for Chrysler Corp's offer today. 
</P>
<P>
Their contents remain a mystery. GM said only that a proposal for a new 
three-year national contract had been given to the union. Ford and the UAW said 
there would be no statements, and UAW locals around the country said they knew 
nothing about the details of the proposals.

$52-Million Fine upheld: Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothin Jr. 
ordered the filed a joint motion to dismiss the fines after settling their 
10-month-long strike Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
/The walkout involved 1,200 striking miners in Virginia and Kentucky. McGlothin 
agreed to dismiss $11.2 million in fines to compensate Pittston for losses 
caused by union efforts to limit coal production. He upheld the remaining $52 
million owed to the state and to Dickenson and Russell counties in Virginia, 
where most of the strike action took place, union leaders payments by the 
United Mine Workers although both Pittston Coal Group Inc. and the union had 
said they were reviewing McGlothin's ruling.

Marketing Deal Scrapped: Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. 
said they are canceling a marketing agreement that the Justice Department 
challenged on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would have given Cincinnati-based P&amp;G, which makes the 
Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy, exclusive rights to sell Ft. Washington, Pa.-based 
Rorer's Maalox antacid. On Aug. 7, the department said it would challenge the 
deal on grounds that it would reduce competition and raise prices in the 
stomach remedy market.

Vehicle Sales Down: Mid-August sales by the nation's major auto makers fell 
4.7% from the same period last year. The figures indicated no dramatic effect 
on sales because of rising gasoline prices spurred by tension in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first full vehicle sales period since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait 
on Aug. 2. The Big Three auto makers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- said their 
cars and trucks sold at an average daily rate of 32,674 units during the Aug. 
11-20 period, compared to a daily rate of 34,290 in the period last year. Car 
sales fell 10%; truck sales rose 5.1% based on strong sales of GM and Ford 
vehicles. Trucks, as a class, are less fuel efficient than cars, and a rise in 
the truck sales figures indicates that consumers did not shy away from gas 
gulpers. Sales of cars made by the Big Three tumbled 17.3%; sales of North 
American-made cars bearing Japanese nameplates rose 45.1%.

SmithKline, Rugby to Sell Generic Dyazide: SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals 
will make a generic form of its popular high blood pressure drug to be 
distributed by Rugby Laboratories, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline Beecham will continue providing Dyazide under its brand-name for 
those who want it. Rugby will ship the generic capsules to pharmacies, chains 
and wholesalers by Oct. 1. Generic competitors for Dyazide, one of the most 
widely prescribed drugs in the country, have been absent from the marketplace 
since Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. earlier this year withdrew its version.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: GIFTS CAN OFFER LASTING REWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be 90 degrees outside, but small-business owners should start choosing 
and ordering Christmas and holiday gifts for their customers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Ordering now allows you to take advantage of sizable discounts on giveaways, 
officially known as "advertising specialties." 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners contributed mightily to the $4.5 billion spent last year 
on a spectacular range of business giveaways, according to Marvin Spike, 
president of the Advertising Specialty Institute in Langhorne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the smallest business with a marketing plan can be competitive in its 
area with the right kind of specialty advertising," said Spike. "And we find 
specialty advertising particularly effective in soft markets when something for 
nothing becomes more appreciated and respected." 
</P>
<P>
But passing out the cheapest key chains or magnets may not be the best 
strategy, according to Jay Conrad Levinson, author of a series of books about 
"guerrilla marketing." 
</P>
<P>
"You will make as many enemies as friends if you give them junk," Levinson 
said. "People like free things, but it is important to match the giveaway to 
the people you are marketing to." 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners have traditionally given customers pencils, pens, 
calendars and key chains. But today, the selection of affordable business gifts 
is staggering. Items range from personalized packages of chewing gum to crystal 
clocks and neon-hued sunglasses. You can emblazon your company's name on 
playing cards, digital watches, plastic Frisbees, "sipper" cups popular with 
athletes and nylon "fanny packs." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a "hot" item this year, it is the zippered nylon fanny pack worn 
around the waist or hips, according to Suzanne Gombos of Nu Century Enterprises 
in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies don't realize how important advertising specialties can be as a 
marketing tool," said Gombos, a partner in the company she formed less than a 
year ago with Darrin Block. She and Block suggest that companies give small 
gifts to employees, suppliers, vendors and potential customers they meet at 
trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tiniest business can afford some type of specialty advertising. By 
taking advantage of preseason discounts, for example, you can buy 144 ceramic 
mugs with your company's name on it for about $300. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with only $100, we can provide bumper stickers, decals, buttons, plastic 
license plate frames or baseball caps," Gombos said. The main problem in her 
business, she said, is educating the public about where to buy specialty 
advertising products. "People know what they are looking for, but they don't 
know where to find the items." 
</P>
<P>
Checking a business-to-business telephone directory under "advertising 
specialties" or asking other business owners where they buy products are 
usually the best ways to find distributors who represent thousands of products. 
</P>
<P>
Clair Schutte, owner of Schutte's Pool &amp; Spa service company in Sepulveda, 
received a flyer from Nu Century and called Gombos six months later. Gombos 
helped him find a graphic artist to design a logo featuring a pool and palm 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Schutte has spent about $1,200 on ceramic coffee mugs and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worth every cent," said Schutte, who spends about $1,000 a month to 
advertise in the Yellow Pages and the Pennysaver. "I think it's a very wise 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
He gave his helpers company shirts to wear to assure neighbors that they are 
going into people's back yards for a legitimate purpose. He also ordered blue 
and gray mugs for his best customers so they will keep his name and phone 
number handy. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses serving big corporations or executives may want to buy leather 
business card holders, marble paperweights or sophisticated, personalized 
calculators. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Margol, founder of Smith &amp; Margol in Los Angeles, recently returned 
from a trip to Asia where she visited factories in Bejing and Hong Kong. Many 
of the specialty items she develops for her clients are manufactured abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Margol has developed a colorful ceramic "Charlie the Tuna" 
coin bank, bendable basketball player dolls and elegant "gift with purchase" 
products for Neutrogena, a soap and shampoo maker. 
</P>
<P>
"Specialty advertising is attractive because the cost of other forms of 
advertising is prohibitive for most business owners in a big city," said 
Margol. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of spending dollars on ephemeral ads, she and other specialty marketing 
consultants recommend investing in useful merchandise with your logo. The 
merchandise doesn't perish and can be kept on hand to be given away at a 
moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
Because you want customers or potential customers to think of your business 
first, the key is to give away something that is useful and visible. Magnets, 
paper clip holders, paperweights and letter openers are likely to sit on 
someone's desk as constant reminders of your firm. 
</P>
<P>
If giving small gifts doesn't appeal to you, try sending Thanksgiving cards to 
beat the Christmas crush. The Leanin' Tree in Boulder, Colo., has a special 
line of business-to-business greeting cards featuring original paintings by 
mostly Western artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We think business card usage is increasing because businesses are recognizing 
the importance of personal contact in this day and age of computerization and 
impersonalization," said Ed Trumble, who founded the company about 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Trumble said, it was not uncommon for the typical American 
family to send 200 Christmas cards a season. Now, because of 25-cent stamps, 
changing social habits and just plain laziness, fewer cards are being sent. 
</P>
<P>
But, with fewer holiday cards in the mail, the card you and your business send 
will really stand out and be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SMART TIPS FOR BUSINESS GIFT-GIVING 
</P>
<P>
Review your marketing plan to see if specialty advertising fits in. 
</P>
<P>
Choose gift items to reflect the interests of your customers, suppliers and 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give away junk. Making a poor impression is worse than making no 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure your logo is attractive and easy to read. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to include your company's full name, address and phone number some 
place on every item. 
</P>
<P>
Order early to take advantage of discounts and avoid the holiday rush.

MIDEAST FEARS PUT STOCKS INTO WORLDWIDE DIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing that a Mideast war would cause economic chaos for much of the 
industrialized world, investors continued to bail out of stock markets from New 
York to Singapore on Thursday, sending prices on nearly every major exchange to 
their lowest levels in at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 76.73 points, or 3%, in heavy trading 
to close at 2,483.42 -- the lowest close since July, 1989. But the selloff was 
nothing compared to the rout in Tokyo's market, where the value of the Nikkei 
stock index fell 5.8% -- the fourth-biggest one-day drop in history. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of war in the Mideast also sent oil prices rocketing. The price of the 
benchmark U.S. crude rose 71 cents Thursday in New York to $31.93 a barrel, the 
highest level in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, long-term interest rates soared anew as investors dumped bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, everyone (in the stock market) rushes for the exit, and some 
people get trampled," said Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, U.S. stocks were worth $95 billion less than they had 
been the day before. Share values have slid by more than $500 billion since 
July, when prices peaked, according to Wilshire Associates, a Los Angeles firm 
that tracks the value of shares traded on the nation's largest exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in oil prices was a major factor in the stock selloff. Investors 
believe that petroleum production in Saudi Arabia and other Mideast nations 
could be abruptly curtailed if war breaks out between the United States and 
Iraq. That would send oil prices and inflation soaring, which could cause 
economic problems in any nation that depends on petroleum imports. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of such a scenario rippled through market after market Thursday. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index fell 3.5%, and, in London, the value of the 
FT-SE 100-stock index slid 1.4%. The Paris CAC 40-stock index closed down 2.1% 
and the Hong Kong market tumbled 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese market's plunge took the Nikkei average of 225 stocks down 
1,473.28, to close at 23,737.63. The Nikkei had not been below 24,000 since 
February, 1988. Following the sharp decline, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced 
it was tightening regulations on speculative futures trading in an effort to 
reduce volatility. 
</P>
<P>
In trading today, Japanese stocks closed up 428.13 points, or 1.8%, to 
24,165.76. The gains emerged from a day of volatile trading. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing drop of stock prices in the United States prompted some U.S. 
firms to announce plans to buy back some of their shares. Fannie Mae, the 
government-sponsored, publicly held firm that buys mortgages from lenders, 
announced plans for a buyback, as did Intel Corp., the big computer chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. market analysts said investors have become increasingly hesitant to hold 
stocks because many believe that a war with Iraq is imminent. "There were no 
peaceful sounds yesterday," said Michael Sherman, chief investment strategist 
at Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although war always makes investors nervous, a war in the Middle East is 
particularly worrisome because it would probably affect worldwide oil supplies 
and prices. Rising oil prices fuel inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates sometime later this year 
to help spur the weak economy. But it is believed to have delayed rate cuts 
because of fears of oil-driven inflation, and some analysts believe that the 
central bank may continue to delay further easing for some weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 250.4 million shares 
changing hands, compared to 175.5 million Wednesday. Only 148 stocks advanced, 
while 1,643 fell. 
</P>
<P>
Investors sold virtually everything they could, including the oil and gold 
stocks that had rallied in recent weeks on the Mideast crisis. Blue-chip losers 
included Boeing, off $2.50 to $42.50; IBM, off $2.125 to $96.875; Procter &amp; 
Gamble, off $3 to $71.125, and Exxon, off $1.75 to $49.625. 
</P>
<P>
The broader measures of stock market performance also declined steeply. The 
NYSE Composite index fell 5.34 to 168.88, a 3% loss. The NASDAQ Composite index 
of over-the-counter stocks plummetted 14.62 to 360.22, down 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bond prices continued to fall, boosting yields on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond to 9.13%, compared to 9.05% on Wednesday. The new yield is the 
highest since May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gold prices continued to rise, with the spot price on the New York 
Commodity Exchange climbing $1 to $412 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The dollar continued to weaken, hitting record lows against the German mark 
and the Swiss franc during the day. In New York trading, the dollar closed at 
1.544 marks, versus 1.558 Wednesday, and at 1.252 Swiss francs, compared to 
1.28 Wednesday. The dollar closed at 146.15 yen, down only slightly from 
Wednesday's 146.35 yen.

CRACK'S CHILDREN GROW UP; 
</P>
<P>
THE FIRST WAVE OF YOUNGSTERS PRENATALLY EXPOSED TO COCAINE IS EXPECTED TO HIT 
AN ILL-PREPARED EDUCATION SYSTEM THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Five years after crack cocaine exploded in American cities, public school 
systems are bracing for a grim harvest this fall: an influx of school-age 
children who suffer learning disabilities because their mothers exposed them 
prenatally to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
With many education budgets already stretched to the breaking point, 
administrators despair of finding the money, staff and training to provide the 
special help these children will need to succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect an explosion," said Garnett Pinkney, who is helping organize a pilot 
teaching program for drug-exposed children in the 81,300-student Washington, 
D.C., public school system. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which has one of the nation's only public school programs for such 
children, receives daily calls from desperate districts across the country 
searching for help and information, said Phillip Callison, assistant 
superintendent for the Los Angeles Unified School District's special education 
division. 
</P>
<P>
But even that program only reaches a fraction of the children who need help, 
Callison conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Callison and other educators fear that unless comprehensive steps are taken 
nationwide, a generation could be lost -- one that the educational system alone 
cannot save. 
</P>
<P>
"It's society's problem," Callison said. "Public health has to deal with it, 
mental health, hospitals and welfare agencies." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how many drug-damaged children are already enrolled or 
headed for first grade, but educators believe that this fall will bring the 
first big wave of such children into the schools. If current trends continue, 
the federal Department of Health and Human Services estimates that there will 
be about 4 million cocaine-exposed children and babies in 10 years who will 
require billions of dollars in special services. 
</P>
<P>
Medical research into the prenatal effects of drugs and educational studies on 
how to teach drug-exposed children are still in the early stages. In addition, 
it is often impossible to separate prenatal drug damage from the environmental 
problems bred by poverty, abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
But experts agree that children exposed prenatally to drugs can suffer from a 
host of emotional, physiological and neurological problems that linger long 
after a newborn undergoes withdrawal. Symptoms range from mental retardation 
and convulsions in the most extreme cases to poor motor and cognitive skills, 
hyperactivity, speech defects, an inability to concentrate or remember, 
violence, apathy and lack of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, it's as if they haven't been socialized," said Oakland Unified 
School Supt. Pete Mesa, who estimated that up to six youngsters in each 
first-grade class in the district already exhibit behavior ranging from 
violence to near autism. 
</P>
<P>
At the Salvin Special Education Center in Los Angeles, one of three locations 
where UCLA pediatricians and teachers have showered small groups of 
drug-exposed children with individual attention, some educational strategies 
are beginning to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers have found that children exposed prenatally to drugs are easily 
overwhelmed by too many people or toys and too much noise or movement. Often, 
they play by scattering, batting or picking up and putting down toys rather 
than combining them in patterns and engaging in fantasy play, said Dr. Judy 
Howard, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate, teachers introduce new concepts slowly, accompanied by 
exaggerated physical or verbal cues. Teachers have also found that many 
children bloom under the extra attention. For children who have spent their 
lives shuttling from foster homes to group care homes, a nurturing teacher may 
provide the only consistent security and love they have ever known. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for such care is high: Los Angeles Unified spends $15,000 on 
teachers, pediatricians, speech therapists, aides and social workers to educate 
each of the 20 Salvin children for one year, compared to the $4,000 it costs to 
educate an average child. 
</P>
<P>
Although the entire Los Angeles pilot program includes only 30 to 40 children, 
it still puts the district ahead of most other large, urban school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Districts such as Oakland, for example, place drug-exposed disabled children in 
special education programs, but there are long waiting lists. Others say that 
wherever possible, these children should be taught in regular classrooms -- but 
with fewer students and more teacher aides. 
</P>
<P>
The 970,000-student New York City public school system is working on special 
programs for drug-exposed children, said James Vlasto, press secretary to 
Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. But "we need more school psychologists, we need 
more funding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago officials "don't have any idea of the size of the problem," said 
Stanley McConner, director of substance abuse programs for the the city's 
public school system, the third-largest district in the country, behind New 
York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified, by contrast, has been identifying drug-exposed children 
and drawing up teaching strategies for the last three years with the help of 
hospitals, teachers and parents. While many of the Salvin children were born 
addicted to crack, some suffer from prenatal alcohol syndrome and others were 
born to users of multiple drugs and alcohol. The program was started after 
UCLA's Howard contacted the Los Angeles school district to say she was seeing 
growing numbers of drug-addicted babies who would probably suffer learning 
disabilities when they entered school. 
</P>
<P>
Today, district officials call the Salvin environment "ideal" and plan to send 
its teachers into other schools one afternoon a week this fall to share what 
they have learned. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be years before they reach the city's hundreds of elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
And the $15,000 being spent per student doesn't buy a miracle cure. Salvin 
teachers insist that the homespun tactics of early intervention, nurturing care 
and individual attention are the keys. The school has one teacher and two aides 
for every eight children. Experts also stress the importance of compiling the 
child's history, which can shed light on specific problems and help teachers 
and doctors come up with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main goals . . . is to have the kids bond with at least one staff 
member," said teacher Marci Schoenbaum, who works with drug-exposed children at 
the Salvin campus near Interstate 10 and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
One 5-year-old now at the Salvin school offers proof of how a life can be 
salvaged. Born to a crack-using mother who lived in an abandoned car, the girl 
was premature and "terribly addicted" at birth, said Mary Jones, her Salvin 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
As a baby, she was left with neighbors and relatives while her mother went in 
search of drugs, and she was physically and sexually abused. Eventually, she 
was placed in a group home for children, arriving at Salvin three years ago 
like a limp and battered rag doll. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the girl brims with inquisitive intelligence. She helps slower children 
interpret and answer questions, and runs up to play with a visitor's purse, 
offering a beaming smile. She also takes classes in piano and ballet and her 
teachers boast that she is the class star. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers spend a lot of time developing play skills, a precursor to more formal 
learning. On a recent day, children fed beans to rubber dinosaurs and colored 
with crayons, trying laboriously to stay within the lines. Others dropped their 
toys in mid-play, racing off to scramble up the jungle gym. One boy pedaled his 
tricycle straight into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, one 5-year-old boy let out a yelp and grabbed the arm of his playmate 
to prevent her from taking the Tyrannosaurus rex. 
</P>
<P>
"He will hide the dinosaur rather than share it," Jones said with a sigh, 
adding that the boy was raised by three stepfathers and their five girlfriends 
because his natural mother was hooked on crack. 
</P>
<P>
"He's due to start kindergarten next year and he doesn't begin to have playing 
skills," she continued. "He's very angry but he doesn't have the tools to tell 
you about it. His speech is damaged; he can't find the right word." 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers and doctors who work with drug-exposed children feel strongly 
that such students should not be isolated in special education programs, 
despite their learning difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"We can provide for their needs in regular school if we . . . provide an 
environment that's loving and more flexible," said Theadora deSoyza, who runs 
the Miriam deSoyza Learning Center in the Bronx, a nonprofit school for the 
disabled that works with increasing numbers of drug-exposed children. DeSoyza 
founded the school in 1971 and named it after her daughter, Miriam, who suffers 
from Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
DeSoyza also warned against the danger of stigmatizing children with labels 
such as "crack baby," which she said contributes to a climate of fear and 
ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
"The school districts are scared to death; you'd think they were getting 
monsters or something," DeSoyza said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers know that cocaine restricts the flow of blood from the mother to 
the fetus through the placenta. In addition, the effects of a mother's alcohol 
and tobacco use on the fetus have been explored in some detail. But much 
remains unknown about how cocaine and other hard drugs damage organs and the 
nervous system, and why some babies are affected while other are not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say some children may recover completely with early help and special 
attention. But others will have lifelong problems no matter how much 
intervention they get, said Dr. Rachelle Tyler of UCLA's School of Medicine, 
the pediatrician who works most closely with the Salvin children. 
</P>
<P>
"They have small heads, small brains, small stature. That's what you have 
psychologically to work with and you can't put any more in there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "a child could look perfectly normal through second grade, and the 
type of effects coke has on the nervous system won't surface till . . . 8 years 
of age," said Dr. Dan Griffith, a developmental psychologist with the National 
Assn. for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education who has tracked a group of 
300 drug-exposed babies for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, working with the children is only half the battle, educators and 
doctors said. To break the cycle of addiction, they said it is also necessary 
to treat the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
In her UCLA study, Howard found that troubled families often have a history of 
impoverishment, abuse and chemical dependency that spans generations. 
</P>
<P>
One mother in Howard's study related that her mother mixed drinks for her as a 
child, saying: "Drink this; it will make you feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Another explained how her own father "shot me up with heroin when I threatened 
to call the cops on him." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of what can happen when a community does become motivated, 
educators cite a program planned for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The three-pronged effort starts in hospitals at birth, when drug-exposed 
children, many of whom are known as "boarder babies" because they have been 
removed from their drug-abusing mothers or abandoned, are identified and 
tracked through the maze of medical, court, social service and foster care 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with educating these children, the district will launch a pilot program 
this December to design teaching strategies. Lastly, school officials have 
expanded their preventive education in hopes that it will persuade students not 
to mix pregnancy with drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to wait until it hit us and teachers were overwhelmed," said 
Pinkney, executive assistant for special populations for the Washington public 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
But teachers, prenatal physicians and child psychologists say much more needs 
to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we need smaller classroom settings and more aides, but how 
that can be accomplished I don't know," UCLA's Tyler said.

MAGELLAN HAS JPL SCRATCHING FOR ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To perplexed scientists Thursday, the Magellan spacecraft looked a little like 
a wayward waif, trying to ingratiate itself with an angry parent. Computer data 
sent back by the troubled Venus Radar Mapper revealed that after it lost 
contact with ground controllers Tuesday night, it fired its small jets over and 
over, trying to compensate for various problems, real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"It got in trouble nine times," said Steve Wall, a scientist at the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Or at least 
it thought it was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the spacecraft burned a "tremendous amount" of fuel -- more than 
five pounds -- as it went through nine different maneuvers. That loss of fuel 
poses some concern for engineers at the Pasadena lab, who expect the craft to 
remain in orbit around Venus for up to two years, but Wall said Magellan still 
has plenty of fuel aboard for the remainder of its assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an immediate problem," he said. The craft, which carries a radar 
camera capable of peering through the dense clouds that hide the surface of the 
planet, had 293 pounds of fuel aboard when it was launched toward Venus from 
the space shuttle last year. 
</P>
<P>
What appeared to be the biggest problem Thursday was figuring out what went 
wrong after the spacecraft reached Venus. Magellan has broken communications 
with controllers twice since it went into orbit around the Earth's sister 
planet earlier this month -- on Aug. 16 for 14 hours, and again on Tuesday for 
17 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers had hoped that they were dealing with a single problem that caused 
both shutdowns, but Wall said Thursday that does not appear to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent loss of communications, during which Magellan went through nine 
separate maneuvers, had "a lot of different earmarks" than the earlier one, 
Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
That suggests that the spacecraft, cornerstone of a $750-million Venus mission, 
may have more than one problem. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and scientists at JPL met all day Thursday, sorting through 
information that Magellan is sending back "very slowly," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that the spacecraft itself seems to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news was that no one could figure out why it breaks its communications 
link with the Earth and assumes a "safe mode" designed to ensure that its solar 
energy panels point toward the sun and its antenna sweeps past the Earth 
periodically, making it possible for engineers at JPL to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they will take whatever time is needed to be sure they 
understand Magellan's problems before ordering the spacecraft to begin its 
comprehensive mapping of Venus. They had planned to begin that this weekend, 
but that is likely to slide several days because of the continued problems with 
the craft.

Abraham Lincoln has apparently been emancipated from a future on a storage 
shelf by tourists at Disneyland who rebelled over the prospect of Kermit the 
Frog replacing him at a park exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials have shelved their plans to close the 25-year-old "Great Moments 
With Mr. Lincoln" show on Disneyland's Main Street this weekend, they said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland operators said visitors and park employees alike reacted angrily to 
reports that the robot replica of the nation's 16th President was being removed 
to make room for a new Muppets attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Put the Muppets in there? No! No!" said Leona Banks of Kankakee, Ill., 
standing outside the Main Street opera hall where a mechanical Lincoln robot 
rises from an antique chair to deliver a five-minute speech 51 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibit carries a message to the people of the United States. It's 
something very emotional -- and I'm not just saying this because I'm from the 
'Land of Lincoln.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grumbled 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand Forks, Minn.: "Lincoln was 
President. Kermit is a frog." 
</P>
<P>
Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters last year. The 
company disclosed in January that it would begin staging parades and live shows 
in 1991 featuring the puppets developed by the late Jim Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Dick Tracy-themed attractions and new Hollywood-oriented shows 
scheduled to open through 1999, the Muppets are part of an expansion program 
that park officials have dubbed "The Disney Decade." 
</P>
<P>
Reports have circulated for the last three months among Disneyland's 8,000 
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which also houses exhibits honoring 
park founder Walt Disney, would be turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced a week ago that the Lincoln exhibit would be closed Sunday 
for the "refurbishing" of the opera house. They said plans for the plush-seated 
auditorium near the park's entrance gate would be disclosed later. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, park operators said Lincoln will live -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Paul Goldman said park planners are looking at several 
other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the "It's a Small World" 
attraction. "It's a matter of shoehorning things in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said officials were surprised by the outcry over Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd asked a few days ago I'd have said that being a 25-year-old 
attraction, its popularity has passed. But there seems to be a lot of sentiment 
for Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures, they 
acknowledge that park visitors haven't shown a lot of interest in the Lincoln 
show. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, only a handful of park visitors filed into the 500-seat theater 
to watch the 13-minute production. The show starts with photographic slides and 
ends with a full-sized replica of Lincoln standing at the U.S. capitol and 
gesturing as it speaks of liberty and patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
The electronically animated figure blinks its eyes, wiggles its fingers and 
nods and turns. The robot was rewired about five years ago to add sophisticated 
new movements as part of a $200,000 renovation, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's short speech actually consists of excerpts from five addresses 
delivered by the Great Emancipator between 1838 and 1864. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope they aren't going to do away with this," said tourist John 
Folliard of Oregon City, Ore. "The rides are nice, but I'm real patriotic." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim teacher Nola Vroom escorted 60 children from a summer church camp to 
"Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln" after hearing that the display was slated for 
closure this weekend. She said she wanted to make sure they had one last chance 
to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Kermit because I'm a first-grade teacher. But I like Lincoln, too," she 
said, glancing around the nearly deserted entrance to the theater. "If more 
people knew this was going to close, they'd be lined up to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland employee Sandy Spurgeon, who has seen the Lincoln show "thousands of 
times" during the 10 years she has worked as a show hostess, said the Muppets 
should go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they fit in on Main Street," Spurgeon said. "I've had people 
come here in tears about this." 
</P>
<P>
Across the park, Monorail ride operator Julio Escobedo agreed that the 
Disneyland entrance should keep its nostalgic, turn-of-the-century Americana 
look. "Take out the submarine ride and put the Muppets there," he said.

STING: FORMER STATE SENATOR TOLD U.S. AUTHORITIES THAT HE GAVE SPECIAL "ACCESS" 
TO UNDERCOVER OFFICER IN RETURN FOR A $20,000 CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.

Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter admitted to federal authorities last fall that 
he gave special "access" to an undercover operative in exchange for a $20,000 
campaign contribution, an FBI agent testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Agent Jim Wedick said Carpenter also contended that he was aware the 
$20,000 payment was part of a sting investigation but accepted the money 
because he was conducting his own "reverse sting." 
</P>
<P>
"He thought he could take the money and not violate the law and he thought he 
could conduct a sort of 'reverse sting' on the FBI," said Wedick, who 
participated in an interview last November when Carpenter attempted to explain 
his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he was lying," the agent added under cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony from Wedick is the harshest evidence presented so far against 
Carpenter, who is on trial on four counts of racketeering, extortion and 
conspiracy stemming from the FBI investigation of corruption in the state 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors allege that the former Democratic senator from Norwalk, now 
a member of the State Board of Equalization from the Los Angeles area, traded 
official actions for the $20,000 in campaign contributions. Prosecutors charge 
that it is a violation of the law to provide "access" -- that is, to meet with 
certain citizens at the exclusion of others -- in exchange for money. 
</P>
<P>
Wedick's testimony, coming as the prosecution rests its case, puts Carpenter in 
an awkward strategic position because it commits the former senator to a 
specific line of defense before he ever takes the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter and his then-lawyer, Richard Crane, met with Wedick, U.S. Atty. David 
F. Levi and other prosecutors and FBI agents last November in an attempt to 
persuade the authorities to drop charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wedick, Carpenter said he knew he was the target of an FBI sting 
from the first time he was approached by his aide, John Shahabian, in 1986 with 
the possibility of receiving a $20,000 campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The money was offered by undercover FBI Agent John E. Brennan, who was posing 
as Jack Gordon, a free-spending Alabama businessman seeking legislation to help 
his shrimp-importing business get a California tax break. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 interview, Carpenter contended that he knew the money was part of a 
sting and directed Shahabian to collect the money but not do anything that 
could be "misconstrued" as aiding passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he did not vote on the bill, he did not participate in the legislative 
process, he did not grease the bill or seek (Senate President Pro Tem David A.) 
Roberti's assistance," Wedick testified. "Therefore he could not be responsible 
for doing anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Carpenter admitted taking specific actions in 
exchange for the money, Wedick said. 
</P>
<P>
"Carpenter said he did provide Gordon access and that he did consider (he was) 
giving Gordon access in exchange for the contribution," Wedick told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Wedick, who is the agent in charge of the FBI sting investigation, also 
testified that Carpenter acknowledged talking about the bill with Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), the official author of the bill, and Sen. Leroy 
Greene (D-Sacramento), the floor manager of the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Wedick questioned Carpenter's contention that he knew all along the payment was 
part of a sting and was careful not to violate the law. Carpenter, the agent 
noted, was "astonished" to learn during the 1989 interview that he had lunched 
with an undercover FBI agent, Wedick said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury already has heard a lengthy tape-recording of the lunch, in which 
Brennan gives Carpenter a check for $5,000 as the final installment of the 
$20,000 in contributions. During the lunch, the senator tells Brennan, "Hey, 
man, you have access."

JUDGE VOIDS STRICT GUAM ABORTION LAW

<P>
A federal judge Thursday overturned the nation's most restrictive abortion law, 
and abortion rights supporters said an appeal of that ruling would threaten the 
Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision 
establishing the right to an abortion, "applied with equal force and effect to 
Guam." 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued that the law did 
not apply to Guam because of the island's status as an unincorporated 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions except when 
the woman's life is in danger. It did not permit abortions in the case of rape 
or incest and made it a crime for someone to advise a woman about an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Munson on March 23 blocked enforcement of the law while he weighed a challenge 
from abortion rights forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat we live with is that the Supreme Court has indicated a willingness 
to overturn Roe vs. Wade," Kate Michelman, executive director of the National 
Abortion Rights Action League, said in a phone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If the governor appeals (Munson's ruling), he will endanger the rights of all 
women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. Our goal is 
to keep these cases out of the courts," Michelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents said that they were not surprised by the judge's decision 
and that the next step probably will be an appeal that would send the case to 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb," said Roland Rivera, vice 
president of Guamanians United for Life. "There is just the next higher level 
to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
"Guam's strong law . . . could not be upheld without overturning Roe vs. Wade," 
said state Rep. Woody Jenkins, lead author of an anti-abortion bill approved by 
the Louisiana Legislature but vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge would follow the 
Roe decision and rule against the Guam law, it must be remembered that this is 
just the first stage in the process," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it violated the free 
speech and due process clauses of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn Roe vs. Wade," 
Simon Heller, an attorney with the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said in a telephone interview from New York.

AIRLINES TOLD TO CHECK FIRM'S ELECTRONICS GEAR;

<P>
SAFETY: FAA OFFICIALS SAY VENDOR MAY HAVE MISREPRESENTED PARTS. THE ALERT COMES 
AFTER THE FBI SEIZES THOUSANDS OF THE COMPANY'S DOCUMENTS.

<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has alerted several major airlines that the 
electronics equipment they bought from a Kansas City aircraft parts vendor may 
have been misrepresented, and it has asked them to ensure that the equipment is 
in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The alert, which officials said was disclosed for reasons of "public health and 
safety," was issued after the FBI seized thousands of documents from the firm, 
K.C. Aerospace, during a probe into whether the firm has been falsely 
describing the condition and origin of the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
FAA and Justice Department officials said they have not ascertained which parts 
are at issue and how much aircraft safety may have been compromised, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have it sized and scoped-out yet," said an FAA spokesman in Kansas 
City. "We had to alert airlines. It looked like some parts being sold do not 
meet rigid specifications." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Stanley, a spokesman for K.C. Aerospace, a 5-year-old, privately owned 
concern that employs 41 people in Kansas City, New York and Miami, described 
the firm as "very safety-conscious" and said that "any question of impropriety 
is totally unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley said the company was cooperating fully with the FBI and that only after 
officials turned over documents to agents on Aug. 15 did the officials present 
a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
K.C. Aerospace's FAA certification as a repair station also is under scrutiny 
by the FAA, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the investigation said the FBI probe began with 
information from a confidential informant. 
</P>
<P>
K.C. Aerospace sells its services and parts to commercial airlines in the 
United States and abroad, as well as to brokers and general aviation customers. 
Jean Paul Bradshaw II, the U.S. attorney in Kansas City who is conducting the 
investigation, said the firm sells directly to three major airlines and deals 
with others through brokers. He refused to disclose the names of the customers. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanley said the company's primary customers are Continental, Northwest and 
Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman, confirmed that the airline had received 
an FAA "advisory" about the K.C. Aerospace parts and said the airline now is 
identifying which components ought to be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said all "rotable," or reusable, parts that it buys from K.C. Aerospace 
and other suppliers are "bench-tested" by Northwest mechanics before they are 
put into an aircraft. The reusable parts usually have to do with a plane's 
airworthiness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., an industry trade group, said the FAA 
had advised that "a pretty long list of airlines" is represented among K.C. 
Aerospace's direct and indirect customers. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA is working to aid airlines in identifying the parts that should be 
removed from their inventories or replaced, the Justice Department said in 
announcing the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Continental and Eastern did not respond to calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the unusual step of announcing an investigation, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh said officials "must be constantly alert to allegations that involve 
tampering with . . . safety. Such actions . . . will be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said the FAA alert was issued on the basis of 
"preliminary results of the examination of these documents" seized from K.C. 
Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
"K.C. Aerospace has neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime at 
this time," the Justice Department said. "The investigation will continue and 
evidence may be presented to a federal grand jury in Kansas City."

Replacing a defective gene in colon cancer cells can halt their growth in the 
test tube, a finding that may point the way to new treatments for America's No. 
2 cancer killer, researchers reported in Washington. The new work shows that 
the gene plays a key role in suppressing cancerous growth in the colon, and 
possibly elsewhere in the body, said researchers from Johns Hopkins University 
in Baltimore and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Healthy persons 
usually have two normal gene copies.

Health officials predicted Thursday that polio will be wiped out in the Western 
Hemisphere this year, 35 years after the famous Salk vaccine began a dramatic 
battle against the crippling disease. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of the potentially deadly viral disease has steadily declined in 
South America and North America since the polio vaccine was introduced in the 
1950s, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, only four new cases have been discovered in the hemisphere, said Dr. 
Ciro de Quadros, author of the CDC report. "We are cautiously optimistic, but 
all indications are that we are going to totally eradicate this virus in the 
next few months," he said.

DESERT-BOUND MARINES LEARN ABCS OF HOW NOT TO OFFEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Along with their chemical weapons gear, U.S. Marines bound for the Middle East 
are receiving a quick Emily Post course on how to avoid ugly Americanisms in a 
foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
Don't pass the bread with your left hand. Never give the "A-OK" sign. Refrain 
from gawking. If introduced to an Arab man -- women are out of the question -- 
stand close to him. Very close. And don't be startled if he takes your hand. 
</P>
<P>
That was some of the advice given to 50 Marines at Camp Pendleton on Thursday 
-- an almost humorous element of training that otherwise has focused on weapons 
and gas masks and acclimation to searing desert heat. 
</P>
<P>
But for these Marines, sitting in rapt attention in a large conference room -- 
some taking copious notes -- the advice was intended to ease the merging of 
cultures suddenly joined by the possibility of war. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines are likely to wind up in the Persian Gulf, where the surrounding 
nations are known for the strict practice of Islam. This is particularly true 
in Saudi Arabia, where the bulk of the American troops are stationed and where 
religion permeates everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
Never cross your legs when sitting among Arabs, warned Navy Cmdr. Stanley B. 
Scott, because exposing the underside of your shoes to your guest is an insult 
something akin to swearing, "Camel dung on you!" 
</P>
<P>
When Muslims set out their prayer rugs at midday in a public area, do not take 
pictures and do not gawk. Keep walking, but take the long way around behind 
them, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
If you should be invited into a Muslim's home in that part of the world, don't 
expect to see any women. They'll be in the kitchen, strictly off limits to 
visitors. And if you come across a Muslim woman in public, don't even think 
about asking her what she's doing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
If you compliment an Arab on his headdress, expect him to promptly offer it to 
you as a gift. Not only had you better accept, Scott said, but you'd better 
offer a reciprocal gift -- your own hat. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went Thursday at Camp Pendleton, with Scott giving another of his 
two- or three-times-daily briefings to Marines about Middle Eastern culture and 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a United Methodist minister and senior chaplain to the 1st Marine 
Division headquartered at Camp Pendleton, spent three years in Bahrain and 
traveled throughout the Middle East, making him an expert of sorts on Arab 
customs and culture. For the past two weeks, he's been holding forth daily for 
as many as 600 Marines at a time about how they should behave off-duty as 
guests in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks mirrored the contents of a 40-page booklet produced by the Army and 
already distributed to U.S. service personnel overseas, covering such subjects 
as how to greet Arab men and warning that joining your forefinger and thumb and 
waving doesn't mean everything's A-OK. It's a curse. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Scott talked of such things as Arab speaking patterns, native 
dress, marriage and family values, food, drink and religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to sensitize Marines to what they may face, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about how we'll be received. Not the short term, but how we'll get 
along with them down the road, 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Don't beckon an Arab by pointing at him palm up and curling your fingers 
upward. That's how you get a dog's attention, he said; for an Arab, turn your 
palm down, then curl your fingers back toward you. 
</P>
<P>
Don't figure on sharing a bottle of wine or popping a six-pack, because the 
Koran, the Muslims' holy book, has declared alcohol taboo -- along with 
adultery, fornication, pornography and the eating of pork. If invited into an 
Arab's home, plan on drinking coffee or tea. 
</P>
<P>
Never pass a plate or bowl with your left hand, Scott admonished. The left hand 
is traditionally reserved for sanitary functions, and to use it when offering 
food or drink is the basest of insults. 
</P>
<P>
He advised Marines not to take boom boxes or rock 'n' roll cassette tapes to 
Saudi Arabia, and the Marine Corps already has notified families not to send 
any photos of nude or even semi-nude women to the men overseas -- including 
pictures of wives and girlfriends clad in bathing suits -- because Middle 
Eastern culture frowns on it. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Ken Johnson acknowledged after the 30-minute briefing that he and 
his buddies were a little put off about the prospects for enjoying free time in 
Saudi Arabia, if they're destined to go there. "The guys are asking each other, 
what are we going to do with ourselves? I guess build sandcastles."

Tens of thousands of refugees stranded in a vast no man's land between the 
border posts of Jordan and Iraq struggled to continue their arduous journey 
Thursday in the face of intense heat, a lack of water and food and the tie-up 
of a border that has been ordered closed. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan officially closed its border at midnight Wednesday because huge numbers 
of refugees, mainly Egyptian, were stacking up at its southern port, Aqaba, for 
lack of ships to take them away. Other nationalities were having trouble 
arranging special flights for their citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian border post is 50 miles from the actual frontier and the Iraqi 
post, so thousands of migrants in cars, buses and trucks were stuck between the 
two. About 11,000 were permitted to cross to the Jordanian side, but thousands 
more remained. 
</P>
<P>
In the gap between the Jordanian frontier post at Ruweished and the Iraqi post 
at Tuaybil, up to 50,000 refugees made snail's-pace progress, witnesses said. 
The heat and the lack of clean water and food were taking their toll, said a 
physician who visited the area. 
</P>
<P>
No deaths were reported, but three women went into labor and gave birth after 
being rushed across the border to Jordan. The situation is considered grave by 
physicians visiting the site. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell the truth, it is miserable," said Adel Quraan, a physician with the 
Red Crescent aid society. "A lot of people are in need of everything -- food, 
medicine, water. I think the heat is the big problem. There are lots of sick 
people -- hundreds of sick, thousands." 
</P>
<P>
The condition of refugees stranded inside Iraq near the border was unclear. 
Jordanian border officials said a riot broke out when a water truck appeared 
and the travelers rushed for it. Soldiers fired rifles into the air to quell 
the uproar. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports of 20,000 refugees lined up at the sealed crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Many were suffering from heat stroke, Quraan said, and headaches brought on by 
lack of water were a common complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside Jordan, the situation improves, but there are still enormous 
problems, officials said. An emergency airlift sponsored by European nations 
got under way at Aqaba, the port in Jordan's far south, to ease a bottleneck 
slowing the rush of Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
In between, thousands more Asians and Arabs took refuge in Amman, the capital 
-- in vacant lots, on the grounds of embassies, on sidewalks and in mosques and 
churches -- while waiting for transportation to their distant homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government was defensive about having closed its border. "The 
recent move is temporary and will last only for a few days," said Alem Masadeh, 
Jordan's interior minister, in charge in immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 200,000 refugees fleeing Kuwait in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion 
have entered Jordan, but less than half have found transportation out. A 
relative handful have left Iraq, although there are hundreds of thousands of 
migrant workers in that country too. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen British diplomats and their family members were reported to be 
crossing into Jordan on Thursday, but their arrival could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport, Me., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United 
States does "understand Jordan's predicament" in handling the flow of refugees. 
"We are working with them and other countries in the region, and we are hopeful 
that we can help alleviate the situation and help resolve this matter," he said 
Thursday. "But we don't have any resolution of it at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian arrivals, of whom about 300,000 live in Kuwait, are mostly 
laborers. They have left much of their money in Kuwaiti banks shut since the 
invasion. Many sold off their belongings at cut-rate prices to raise money for 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of looting and thievery were common, along with stories of Iraqi 
customs officials confiscating electrical equipment that many tried to take 
with them. For the West, the invasion of Kuwait may appear to be an oil grab. 
For the humble workers, it was a grab for their videotape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they ask, but if you refuse, they drew a rifle," said Mishik 
Palabarti, a hospital chef from southeast India who was camping at the Indian 
Embassy in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
For the huge migration inside no-man's land, the present problems were fast 
eclipsing the problem they left behind in Kuwait. Jordan is trying to deliver 
water by tank truck, but there is some question about the cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
"Stomach illness, especially in children, adds already to the serious 
dehydration," said Quraan, the physician. "If not treated, it could lead to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance with medicine sent to the zone was quickly emptied. Three 
ambulance teams will be sent today, and a tent will be set up at Ruweished for 
medical treatment, Quraan said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a danger of many deaths if the situation is not cleared up in a day 
or two," Quraan added. He reported seeing huge groups of cars and trucks all 
along the route between Ruweished and Tuaybil, with many people sleeping in 
whatever shade they could find or lolling sleepily in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
At Ruweished, there were alternating scenes of desperation and patience. The 
crush at the Jordanian immigration gate was steady, but relatively peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian immigration officials often tossed clumps of passports out 
to waiting crowds, setting off shouts and frantic shoving matches. There were 
frequent small fistfights as travelers rushed to board the infrequent buses. 
</P>
<P>
Watermelon and tea salesmen were doing a brisk business. Shade was in scarce 
supply: A customs shed, a baked eucalyptus tree and a few buildings yielded up 
the elusive commodity. It was about 100 degrees on the rocky desert plateau. 
</P>
<P>
In Amman, an amazing variety of nationalities were drawn to their embassies, 
where makeshift shelters were set up. 
</P>
<P>
At the Indian Embassy, men clustered on plastic mats under blanket tents, and 
soaked pieces of bread in a vegetable curry cooked in a large common pot. About 
400 Indians were idling on the embassy grounds and 1,000 more were scattered 
throughout the city in auditoriums, theaters and vacant fields. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the arrivals complained that their savings, slashed by Iraq's decision 
to annex Kuwait, lie unreachable in banks. Robert Digruz, an air-conditioning 
technician, said he was due to be paid two months' salary the day of the Iraqi 
invasion, but the company quickly went out of business. Soldiers and 
impoverished Iraqis flooded Kuwait city and stole office equipment and company 
cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see empty car lots all over the city. I myself was forced to give up 
my wedding ring. What can you do? They have guns," he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
He and four friends pooled money for the trip overland through Baghdad to 
Jordan. It took three days, with delays in the Iraqi capital, at the Iraqi 
frontier and at Ruweished. A tourist bus, hand-labeled "Indian," picked them up 
and carried them to Amman. 
</P>
<P>
On the door of the embassy, lists of passengers to board special flights to 
Bombay were posted, but the going was slow. Digruz figured it would take him 
three more days to leave Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at the Sri Lankan Embassy around the corner was similar, and so were 
the tales of evaporated life savings and long desert journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Kamal Silva, a hospital worker, said bread was being rationed in Kuwait. Now 
that he is safe in Amman, his thoughts turned to his job prospects back home, 
where he figured he would earn no more than a third of the $800 a month he did 
in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we went to Kuwait," he said. "There was money there." About 250 Sri 
Lankans were sheltered at the embassy and at a nearby church. 
</P>
<P>
In a garden in front of Pakistan's embassy, a large green-and-white party tent 
was set up to protect some of the 750 refugees huddled on the ground. Another 
3,000 Pakistanis were scattered around town. 
</P>
<P>
Mirza Zursiqar Ali, a construction consultant, said a busload of Pakistanis 
avoided the long wait at the Tuaybil frontier post by setting out for the 
desert in an end run. Once back on the road, in no-man's land, the bus 
proceeded by road past unsuspecting intermediary checkpoints. The trip from 
Kuwait took him two days.

U.N. TOLD OF VIOLATIONS OF IRAQ EMBARGO 
</P>

Seeking to bolster their push for embargo enforcement powers resisted by the 
Soviet Union, officials from the United States and Britain complained Thursday 
of widespread violations of the international trade sanctions against Iraq, 
saying that "many ships" were carrying Iraqi oil in "many directions." 
</P>
<P>
The charges before a special U.N. sanctions committee followed an announcement 
that negotiators for the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China 
had tentatively agreed on a U.S.-sponsored measure endorsing military force to 
uphold the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
American and British envoys expressed hope that the agreement by the Security 
Council's five big powers meant that Soviet objections to the proposed 
resolution were ending and that the full 15-member body would adopt it by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters 
after a closed meeting of the sanctions committee that there are "many tankers, 
lots of petroleum moving" out of Iraq. "It seems to be headed in many 
directions." 
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador, Crispin Tickell, added that "there are organized 
violations on a wide scale." Neither envoy provided details. 
</P>
<P>
But the Finnish and Cuban ambassadors, who sit on the sanctions panel, 
expressed irritation, suggesting that the charges were an overblown ploy to win 
support for the U.S.-backed enforcement resolution, which failed to win 
Security Council approval early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are ships in the area that have left different ports, going to 
different ports, it doesn't give any evidence to us to say that countries are 
violating," said deputy Finnish Ambassador Marjatta Rasi. 
</P>
<P>
The agreed-on resolution, which permits the use of "minimum force" to disable 
and board merchant ships suspected of embargo violations, still must be 
reviewed by top officials of the member nations. 
</P>
<P>
Most critical are the Soviets, who have been opposing U.S. demands for 
unilateral authority to enforce the embargo imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait. The Soviets have sought instead to place a U.N. committee 
in control of policing the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also continue to argue that action on the unprecedented resolution 
should await further diplomatic efforts to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis as 
well as clear evidence that the embargo is being breached. 
</P>
<P>
However, American and British officials were hopeful that the measure would be 
adopted as early as today. A top Soviet diplomat also predicted action soon, a 
seemingly significant statement because U.S. officials have said they would not 
press for a vote unless Soviet support was assured. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Soviet Union, China has objected to the resolution but has 
indicated it will abstain from voting rather than cast a veto. Each of the five 
permanent members of the Security Council has the power to block a measure. 
There appears to be sufficient support among the council's 10 temporary members 
to guarantee adoption of the U.S. proposal. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has declared that U.S. warships already have the right to halt 
suspect merchant vessels because Kuwait has requested assistance under a U.N. 
Charter provision. However, the United States has sought to obtain a broader 
"U.N. umbrella" to avoid being portrayed as a lone operator against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on wording of the resolution was reached after nearly a week of 
intense five-power talks at France's U.N. mission on the 8th floor of a 
skyscraper near U.N. headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering emerged beaming from a session Thursday afternoon and told reporters 
before ducking into his limousine: "It was a very productive meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he issued a statement saying that "we have agreed to a draft text to 
send to our capitals." 
</P>
<P>
Tickell agreed that substantial progress had been made, saying after the 
meeting, "We're working rather well together. We are working hard on texts and 
ideas together, and it is going well." 
</P>
<P>
When Valentin V. Lozinskiy, the deputy Soviet ambassador, was asked if the 
Soviets had been "holding things up," he exclaimed with a chuckle: "I'd say the 
Iraqis!" 
</P>
<P>
Without saying how the Soviets would vote, Lozinskiy said the Security Council 
"probably" would act this week. Tickell, when informed of this remark, 
commented, "That sounds a sensible prophecy." 
</P>
<P>
Lozinskiy, pressing his way through a forest of cameras and reporters, 
continued to question the need for immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
"Political and diplomatic efforts should be given the chance" before broad 
enforcement powers are granted, he said.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghanistan's president, Najibullah, 
met Thursday for talks, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah had been reported on vacation in the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also joined the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah told Gorbachev and Shevardnadze that his government is trying to 
bring a peaceful end to his nation's civil war and said Afghanistan is moving 
toward normalization and reconciliation, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah has been locked in a struggle with rebels seeking to oust his 
Soviet-backed government. The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 
to back Najibullah's troops. It withdrew its troops last year. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed events in Iraq, but Tass provided few details.

A Pittsburgh teen-ager was allowed to leave Kuwait, where she was held by Iraqi 
soldiers for 20 days, and has arrived safely in India. 
</P>
<P>
Vinil Polam, 14, reported Wednesday that the soldiers treated her well and that 
she is unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"She's safe with her mom," said her father's office manager, Carol Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager arrived in Madras, India, where her grandmother lives, on 
Wednesday with 28 other citizens of India, Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Polam's British Airways flight to India was blocked by Iraqi occupation forces 
during a stopover in Kuwait.

The Navy has set up a postal adopt-a-sailor program so Americans can write to 
Navy and Marine personnel in the Persian Gulf, a Washington official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A post office box has been set up in response to thousands of requests from 
Americans who wish to show their support but do not know individual servicemen 
or servicewomen overseas, said Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Mitchell, a Navy spokesman in Washington. It is not intended for families 
of military personnel in the gulf, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"This allows a manageable way for people to be supportive," Mitchell said. 
"It's a real morale boost for the sailors and Marines. And this is a way to get 
mail to people who might not otherwise get it. Mail call is very important, and 
when you don't get it, it's pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
Only letters mailed first-class and weighing less than 12 ounces will be 
forwarded to sailors and Marines deployed in the gulf.

"It is one of those quaint British traditions . . . sending artists to a war 
zone," said John Keane, whose work includes paintings of the Nicaraguan 
conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Keane has received a $19,000 commission from the Imperial War Museum in London 
to go to the gulf and add to the museum's collection of 12,000 war paintings.

SOLZHENITSYN WILL NOT VISIT SOVIET UNION, TASS SAYS

<P>
Exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose Soviet citizenship was restored 
last week by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has rejected an invitation to visit his 
homeland, the Soviet news agency Tass reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Russian federation's prime minister, Solzhenitsyn said 
it would be unthinkable for him to be a guest or tourist in his native country, 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I return home, it will be to live and to die there," he said, according 
to the news agency. 
</P>
<P>
A call to Solzhenitsyn's secretary, Leonard Dilisio, went unanswered Thursday 
night. Solzhenitsyn, who lives with his family in Cavendish, Vt., has 
consistently refused to talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Aug. 17, Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalia, released a statement denying a 
Tass report that the 1970 Nobel laureate has had high-level contacts with 
Soviet authorities and has agreed to accept restoration of Soviet citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband demands that expulsion orders and treason charges against 
him be lifted and that all his books be printed and widely distributed in the 
Soviet Union before he will return.

U.S. PAVES WAY FOR BUILDING OF TELESCOPES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: STUDY OF IMPACT ON ENDANGERED RED SQUIRREL IS HELD NOT NECESSARY 
FOR ARIZONA PROJECT. CONSERVATIONISTS WILL FIGHT THE RULING.

In a move sure to spark a challenge from environmentalists, the U.S. Forest 
Service on Thursday cleared the way for the construction of three telescopes on 
an Arizona mountaintop occupied by an endangered red squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy review, the Justice Department told Forest Service officials 
that they could issue a permit for the astronomical observatory without 
requiring further study of its threat to the imperiled Mt. Graham red squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
George H. Leonard, associate chief of the Forest Service, pledged that his 
agency "will carefully monitor and report on the squirrel population" during 
the construction of the telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that the project will be shut down and re-evaluated if it 
results in harm to more than six squirrels in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Arizona, which has sought to build its $200-million Mt. 
Graham International Observatory since 1984, heralded the decision and said 
work to clear the site for the first telescope could begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The astronomers are anxious to get started," university spokesman Steve 
Emerine said. "They've been waiting a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the news from conservationists and other foes, however, suggested 
that they may have to wait still longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be in court in the morning," warned Robin Silver, a Phoenix Audubon 
Society leader. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this action a breach of public trust," Duane L. Shroufe, director 
of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, added in a statement. "How scientists 
who purport to be reaching for the stars can have so little foresight about 
what is beneath their feet is beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Graham red squirrel, once abundant in the forests that cap the 
10,700-foot mountain south of Tucson, has declined precipitately in recent 
years, mostly because of piecemeal losses of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The shy half-pound animal was added to the nation's list of endangered species 
in 1987. The species, found only on Mt. Graham, now numbers as few as 132. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the listing, the university -- aided by such prestigious partners as 
the Vatican and the Smithsonian Institution -- pressed forward with its 
project, which includes one instrument billed as the world's most powerful 
land-based telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists concluded that squirrels 
and astronomy could coexist on Mt. Graham. But later, in depositions prepared 
as part of a lawsuit seeking to block the telescopes, those same biologists 
disclosed that they had been ordered by superiors to prepare documents that 
supported the project. 
</P>
<P>
That disclosure sparked a flurry of events ending with the formation of a 
blue-ribbon panel of federal scientists to study the issue. Their report, 
released earlier this month, concluded that a fresh assessment of the 
observatory's threat to the squirrel was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department disagreed. A statement released by the Forest 
Service said Administration attorneys believe a 1988 law that exempted the 
telescopes from certain environmental reviews made additional study of the 
project's impacts unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The tug of war over Mt. Graham represents one of the nastiest environmental 
battles in Arizona history. The squirrel became a national issue in May after 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., in a comment that touched off a storm of 
protest, said: "Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black 
one or a brown one. Do we have to save every subspecies?"

Clashes between Sri Lankan security forces and Tamil militants left at least 32 
rebels dead, 12 of them killed when helicopter gunships strafed a hide-out in 
northern Sri Lanka, a senior military official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The violence occurred on the second day of a 3-day-old major offensive aimed at 
breaking rebel control of the area surrounding a 300-year-old Dutch fort in the 
city of Jaffna, where 200 government troops have been trapped since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Sri Lankan soldiers, backed by artillery and helicopter gunships, 
stormed the peninsula Wednesday and attacked the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 Tigers were killed and an undetermined number of others wounded, 
the senior military official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have destroyed a large number of Tiger bunkers around the Jaffna fort camp, 
where the rebels have been harassing us for more than nine weeks," the official 
said. "Seven of our soldiers were also injured during the operation." 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the offensive was expected to continue for another day. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have used automatic weapons and mortars in sporadic attacks on the 
fort, preventing government helicopters from delivering food and other supplies 
and from evacuating wounded soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The government has staged repeated attacks on rebel positions around the fort 
but has failed to bring the area under government control. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident Wednesday, government helicopters with machine guns 
attacked Tiger rebel positions at Championpattu in the Elephant Pass area of 
the Jaffna peninsula, killing at least 12 rebels, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred after rebels fired at two helicopters on an aerial 
surveillance patrol. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed.

SOME ANC LEADERS AMONG 40 SEIZED IN S. AFRICA

About 40 people, including African National Congress regional leaders, 
struggled with police officers while being arrested during a demonstration 
Thursday against human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the four cities where marches were held. 
</P>
<P>
Factional fighting continued to rage, however, in black townships. Four people 
were killed as policemen fired tear gas to separate rival Xhosa and Zulu war 
bands that fought running clashes and burned houses. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and President Frederik W. de Klerk said the factions will meet to try 
to halt violence that has killed more than 500 people, but they gave no date. 
</P>
<P>
The human rights marches were held in Cape Town; Vereeniging, near 
Johannesburg; Bloemfontein, to the south, and the Gazankulu homeland in the 
northern Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, about 40 people marched on the South African Transport Services' 
Culemborg building, which they charge is a police torture center. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Carolus, a regional ANC leader and a South African Communist Party 
leader, called Culemborg "the one place where the most consistent stories and 
allegations of torture of our people have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
Carolus and other protesters were shoved into a police van outside the 
building. Also arrested was Trevor Manuel, regional coordinator of the ANC, who 
struggled with police officers before being forced into the van. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC-organized demonstration was to protest the continued detention of ANC 
members under the Internal Security Act, which permits indefinite detention 
with no access to lawyers in cases involving state security. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students from the Sebokeng black township also marched in 
Vereeniging, calling for improved schools and education. In Bloemfontein, 
thousands of ANC supporters marched to the security police office to hand over 
a list of demands, including an end to indefinite detentions and release of Mac 
Maharaj, an ANC leader.

MANDELA WANTS TROOPS TO HALT TRIBAL FIGHTING

Nelson Mandela on Thursday urged the government to use troops to stop violence 
in black townships, where Zulu and Xhosa war bands clashed for the 12th day 
with spears, axes and knives. Police said four people died. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk said the government would announce new moves 
today to stop the tribal fighting, in which 500 people have been killed. He 
said the moves would include additional restrictions on the ownership of 
weapons, but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, second in command of the African National Congress, said the 
government should place soldiers and police officers around migrant workers' 
hostels in the townships where much of the violence has occurred. When asked if 
the violence was easing, Mandela said, "I don't think so. I think it's too 
early to say that." 
</P>
<P>
There have been troops in the townships since last weekend. Mandela suggested 
that soldiers and policemen be kept around the migrant workers' hostels to 
prevent fighting between hostel residents and others in the townships. 
</P>
<P>
That is being done to some extent already, but not at all hostels and not 
around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a spokesman for the ANC said the group could soon begin peace talks 
with the conservative Zulu-based Inkatha movement. Supporters of the two groups 
are the main combatants in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
In the Kagiso township west of Johannesburg, hundreds of heavily armed Xhosas 
said they wanted to destroy a migrant workers' hostel occupied by Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I die! We just want to fight with the Zulus!" screamed an 
enraged Xhosa armed with a butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides fought with spears, axes and clubs, and police fired tear gas to 
drive them apart. Roaming gangs of Zulus with red headbands looted and burned 
several deserted homes, while Xhosas burned houses belonging to Zulu residents. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Lt. Henriette Bester said four people died, including a 
woman shot by police officers who were trying to stop a crowd from damaging and 
looting houses.

BILL TO UNSEAL CONFIDENTIAL ADOPTION RECORDS IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Legislation to unseal nearly 50 years of confidential adoption records died 
quietly in a Senate committee Thursday, but the bill's author vowed to return 
with a similar measure next year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, pushed by adult adoptees trying to find their natural parents, would 
have revealed the identity of thousands of parents who gave up their children 
in closed adoptions between 1938 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also contained provisions designed to help parents find children 
they relinquished long ago and would have given adoptive parents the same 
access to confidential records that their adopted children would be entitled 
to. 
</P>
<P>
The bill moved briskly through the Assembly and won easy passage in the 
Legislature's lower house in June. But it received more scrutiny in the Senate 
and soon encountered trouble. On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee 
voted to shelve the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush (R-Saratoga), who introduced the bill, conceded 
that the legislation was dead. Lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not enough time to do anything more with it," Quackenbush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not overcome opposition from adoption agencies that said many 
of the children for whom they have found parents have never been told they were 
adopted. The bill would have helped the natural parents find these children, 
and adoptive parents feared the disclosure would damage their relationships 
with their adopted children. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize that people were keeping secrets from the people they 
adopted," said Quackenbush, who adopted a baby last year. "There are a lot of 
adults running around who don't know they were adopted." 
</P>
<P>
Current California law automatically seals the birth certificates, court 
records and agency files in adoption cases. Since 1984, California parents 
relinquishing their children have had the option at the time of adoption of 
allowing their names and addresses to be disclosed after their children reach 
the age of 18. Adult adoptees also have the chance to approve the release of 
personal information to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Records that remain sealed can be opened to adoptees only by a judge who finds 
that "exceptional circumstances" outweigh the parents' right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The Quackenbush bill would have made original birth certificates and court 
records open to the inspection of adoptees and their adoptive parents and would 
have required the Department of Social Services to release information on the 
marriages and married names of the birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would have required the state to conduct a 12-month advertising 
campaign to notify birth parents and adoptees of the change in law and give 
them the chance to keep their records sealed. But opponents said the campaign 
would be insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill was not well-thought out," said Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento). "There is just no reason to go in and rip aside 50 years of 
confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
Quackenbush said he was surprised that the bill went as far as it did. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll refine the bill and come back with it," he said. "Now we know where we 
have to target our efforts."

WEEKEND CAR BARRIERS GO UP IN EDGY WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Westwood Village business operators said Thursday they are outraged by 
city plans to block cars from entering the shopping and entertainment district 
on Friday and Saturday nights. Others are cautiously optimistic that the 
restrictions will actually help their businesses in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Many merchants said they believe the plan will cause them financial hardship 
but will help curtail the sometimes unruly and rambunctious crowds that gather 
on weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
"In part, we're the victims of our own popularity," said Don Gimpel, who for 14 
years has owned the Bon Appetit restaurant and jazz club in the heart of the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
"When crowds get too large and unruly -- and they have been -- people felt 
apprehensive and threatened," Gimpel said. "I want people to feel safe when 
they come into the village, like it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Starting tonight, all streets into Westwood Village, including the main artery, 
Westwood Boulevard, will be closed to traffic from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. on 
Fridays and Saturdays. City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said, however, that the 
actual closure of Westwood just north of Wilshire Boulevard may occur a little 
later because street crews will concentrate on shutting off other intersections 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Those who spoke out against the plan in interviews Thursday said they fear it 
will strangle commerce in the village and lead to a decline from a once-quaint 
enclave into a playground for youngsters -- and sometimes even gang members -- 
that officials said have been showing up in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bureaucratic overreaction at its worst," said Shel Starkman, owner of 
the Old World restaurant. "It's going to be a ghost town. It will be bereft of 
adult clientele." 
</P>
<P>
Most merchants said they were taken by surprise by the city's announcement 
shutting the village to vehicle traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Gimpel said he hopes the restrictions will help the village become a place for 
people to stroll and shop in an atmosphere akin to that of a European village. 
"There is no question it is going to hurt my business -- in the short run we'll 
be hurt badly," he said. "In the long run, it'll help." 
</P>
<P>
Starkman disagreed, saying the barricades that currently block weekend traffic 
into the area from 9:30 p.m. to midnight are bad enough. He said the new 
restrictions will keep out the very people that village merchants hope to 
attract. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Clary, area supervisor for Allied/Royal Parking, said that at least one of 
the three lots his company operates in the village will be affected, and that 
he is dreading the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be happy with not being able to sell the only thing we sell," Clary 
said. "This is supposed to be a free country and people are supposed to be able 
to go where they want to go if they behave themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Clary, like many other area merchants, expressed frustration at the extent of 
the restrictions. "I certainly do agree there are crime problems in the area 
and something sure as dickens should be done. But I don't know if blocking the 
streets so decent people who want to come can't get in is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who outlined the plan Thursday at a press conference in the 
village, said he is hoping that Westwood will become less congested, with fewer 
rowdy crowds, as a result of the ban on vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also stressed that every public parking lot on the perimeter of the 
village -- along Glendon, Gayley and Le Conte avenues -- will be accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Westwood Village can also park their cars in the lot at the Federal 
Building at 11000 Wilshire Blvd., and use the DASH shuttle system that runs 
until at least 1 a.m. at a fee of 25 cents per passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions come three weeks after a Friday night melee in which 
dozens of youths began fighting among themselves, also punching and robbing 
some bystanders. Police finally had to declare an "unlawful assembly" and clear 
the area, the fourth time they have had to do so in the last year. Nine people 
were arrested and three were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The near-riot, as some authorities described it, might have been avoided had 
the new restrictions been in place, according to Yaroslavsky and Los Angeles 
Police Capt. Michael Bagdonas. Both said that the new restrictions had been 
under consideration even before that incident. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help us to better police Westwood," Bagdonas said. "It will cause 
criminals to have second thoughts before coming in here." 
</P>
<P>
Bagdonas said the village, and all of Westwood, actually enjoys a low crime 
rate, "and we want to make sure it stays that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WESTWOOD STREET CLOSURES 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday night, street closures will take place at the following 
intersections (as shown above) in Westwood Village: Westwood northbound at 
Wilshire; Kinross eastbound at Gayley; Broxton southbound at LeCont; Kinross 
westbound at Glendon; Weyburn westbound at Glendon; and Westwood southbound at 
LeCont. Village patrons may leave their cars in the Federal Building parking 
lot at no charge. A shuttle, which charges 25 cents per passenger, will travel 
from the Federal Building into Westwood Village on Fridays between 6:30 p.m. 
and 1:30 a.m. and on Saturdays from 11 a.m. 1:30 a.m.

A 6-year-old boy playing in the checkout line of a Ventura grocery store 
discovered five heirloom rings that a woman had dropped several days before. 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry, which Ventura police said may be worth as much as $7,000, was 
returned to the distraught owner this week. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a sweet little boy," said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. "I'm 
thrilled to death."

Preston Reed and his mother, Stacie, were shopping Aug. 15 at Ralphs Grocery at 
1425 Victoria Ave. He said he was trying to move the shopping cart closer to 
the clerk who was bagging their groceries when he felt the wheel bump against 
something. 
</P>
<P>
He looked down and found a plastic bag holding five rings that bore a striking 
resemblance to a package of toys. 
</P>
<P>
But Preston said he knew right away that this discovery was different from the 
other things he regularly finds. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamonds," he said. "It was diamond rings." 
</P>
<P>
Preston said he handed the rings to his mother, who gave them to the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Manager Dianna Osborn took Preston's phone number and then stuck the 
rings in a drawer and locked it. 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not think much about them until she examined them later. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Oh, my gosh. These are worth a lot of money,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The store turned the rings over to the Ventura Police Department the next day, 
and their owner soon called to ask about them. 
</P>
<P>
"She was so ecstatic," Osborn said. "She was in tears on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
The woman came in Monday morning to collect the jewelry, said Desk Officer 
Sandy Butler of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said the woman told her she has sensitive skin and cannot wear the 
rings, so she carries them in a plastic bag in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
They evidently fell out of the purse when she was paying for groceries, and she 
did not realize until Friday that she had lost them, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pieces of jewelry, which are uninsured, was an engagement ring 
belonging to her mother, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little bit of history attached to each one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She treated Osborn and her husband to dinner at a Ventura restaurant and said 
she planned to give Preston a reward.

ENVIRONMENTAL, CIVIC GROUPS OPPOSE SALES TAX INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
ROADS: SUPPORTERS OF THE HALF-CENT PROPOSAL TO HELP PAY FOR HIGHWAY 
IMPROVEMENTS SAY IT WILL LURE MATCHING STATE FUNDS. 
</P>

<P>
A Ventura County environmental group and a newly formed community organization 
are working to defeat a ballot measure that would raise the local sales tax 
half a cent to help pay for road construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed county tax increase, known as Measure A, was approved last month 
by the Board of Supervisors following statewide approval of Proposition 111, 
which also raises the gasoline tax throughout the state for road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say the proposed county increase is necessary to obtain all 
the state road construction funds available to the county under Proposition 
111. 
</P>
<P>
A rebuttal to the county ballot proposal was filed this week by the 
Environmental Coalition of Ventura County, said Jenny Harrison, an official of 
the elections division of the county clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Moyer, president of the coalition and author of the argument against 
Measure A, said the measure does not specifically identify what road projects 
will be paid for with the tax money and how much each one will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said the proposed tax increase also does not spell out the effects that 
road improvements will have on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Moyer said his group is concerned that widening some of the county's 
major roadways will only serve to promote more growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Measure A is designed to help open up new areas for development while passing 
the costs for future road improvements on to you, the taxpayer," Moyer wrote in 
his ballot argument. "Why subsidize developers when you'll be affected by their 
increased traffic and pollution?" 
</P>
<P>
Bill Charbonneau, Caltrans deputy district director of Ventura County road 
projects, said freeways and highways are built and widened based on population 
projections in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see freeways as promoting growth per se," Charbonneau said. "We build 
freeways to handle traffic. With or without a freeway, there's going to be 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Charbonneau said that while Measure A may not list specific projects that would 
be funded, in part, by the increased sales tax, the county does have a list of 
high priority projects that would benefit from the additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those projects include the joining of the Simi Valley and Moorpark 
freeways, estimated to cost $50 million; the widening of the Saticoy bridge at 
a cost of $15.7 million; and the widening of California 126 from Fillmore to 
the Los Angeles County line at a cost of $27.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Frank, head of the recently formed Committee for Better Transportation, 
based in Simi Valley, said his group also opposes the increased sales tax. He 
said taxpayers were led to believe that Proposition 111 funds would be adequate 
to pay for county road construction and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not tell us that to make full use of Proposition 111 funds, that we 
would have to pass a half-cent sales tax," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111, passed by voters in June, raised the state gas and diesel tax 
by 5 cents a gallon Aug. 1. The tax will then increase a penny every year for 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax is expected to generate $18.5 billion for statewide transportation 
projects over the next 10 years, with Ventura County receiving about $200 
million for road construction. 
</P>
<P>
But county transportation officials said about $2 billion of the tax money will 
be distributed to counties that can come up with matching funds. They said if 
voters were to approve the half-cent sales tax, Ventura County could receive 
another $130 million over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no guarantee that if the half-cent sales tax is passed that we'll get 
a dime from the state," Frank said. "Right now, it's just a politician's 
promise, and we know what that's worth." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Remen, executive director of the California Transportation 
Commission, said that under the state and local partnership program, counties 
that raise matching funds will receive additional Proposition 111 money. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a guarantee that they will get money" if they have eligible projects 
submitted to the Transportation Commission, Remen said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, whose group includes about two dozen people from throughout Ventura 
County, said in the coming weeks that members will talk to community 
organizations about opposing the sales tax increase. He said the group also 
plans to take out newspaper ads to garner support.

MAYOR MOVES TO SPEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE TO MEET TOUGH NEW DEADLINES ON APPLICATIONS. 
IF THEY DON'T, APPROVAL WILL BE AUTOMATIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To encourage construction of affordable housing, Mayor Tom Bradley today will 
direct Los Angeles city departments to meet tough new deadlines for expediting 
low-income housing projects that now face costly delays of up to one year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, applications submitted by affordable housing developers 
automatically will be approved if city departments fail to meet strict new 
deadlines for reviewing building plans, zoning changes, variances, 
environmental impacts or other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Thursday that Bradley's new policy does not 
require City Council approval and takes effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"When projects come through the city bureaucracy, those including affordable 
housing will be given the quickest treatment," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have complained for many years that the city's permit process is 
hampered by layers of confusing red tape that creates unnecessary delays and 
drives up housing construction costs -- which are passed directly on to renters 
and home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that, in essence, Bradley's directive will allow a developer 
to bypass any bureaucrat who cannot meet a given deadline. In such a case, the 
project would be forwarded to its next phase of approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not just saying to city departments, 'This particular part of the 
approval must be done by the deadline,' " said city housing coordinator Michael 
Bodaken. "We are saying this must be done by the deadline, or it will be deemed 
approved and your department will be out of it." 
</P>
<P>
City officials were quick to point out that they do not expect any departments 
to miss deadlines or allow projects to move forward without review. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a strong incentive to (city departments) to deal with these 
projects expeditiously, because no department will want something moving 
forward without their input," Fabiani said. "The pressure is practical as well 
as psychological." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said any project that includes at least 30% affordable housing will be 
affected, and estimated that 4,000 such units will be built in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken said the new deadlines should trim up to a year off the time required 
for city approval of such projects. In the past, he said, affordable housing 
developers who applied for building permits were often forced to wait 18 months 
to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
Housing developers said they welcome the policy change. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Stalk of Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., a nonprofit developer of 
housing for the poor, estimated that he spends $30,000 to $50,000 in staff 
salaries "just finding out why an average, basic project has run into a snag. 
I've been doing this since 1983 and it hasn't gotten any easier." 
</P>
<P>
Loren Bloch, a for-profit developer of affordable apartment complexes, said 
developers tie up millions of dollars to hold land and pay pre-development 
costs while weathering bureaucratic delays. 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't have to put that money out months before you actually built the 
housing, you'd have it invested and be making 10% on it," Bloch said. "That 
loss is what is known as the cost of the money, and the longer the city delays, 
the more cost is included in the final price charged to a buyer or renter." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Hertzberg, an aide to City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, said that although 
Molina had not yet seen the mayor's directive, "it sounds like it . . . forces 
the bureaucrats to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, affordable housing developers are often forced to 
wait longer than any other developers for routine permit approvals because they 
cannot afford to hire lawyers or lobbyists to expedite their projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, if you stand right on top of your project and put all your efforts 
into pushing it through, the truth is it takes about six to eight months to get 
it approved," Bodaken said. "But if you do it the regular way, it takes 1 1/2 
years."

WINDS KICK UP MORE THAN DUST IN DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT DEVELOPERS STRIPPING 
VEGETATION AND PILING DIRT NEAR EXCAVATIONS. DROUGHT HAS EXACERBATED THE 
CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carolyn Kott and many of her neighbors on the east side of Palmdale feel like 
they're fighting a losing battle. The enemy is dirt, and they say they can't 
seem to keep it out of their homes, off their cars or from muddying their 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since developers several months ago stripped the vegetation from several 
large lots nearby, residents in the Antelope Valley neighborhood say they have 
had to live with clouds of dirt blown by the high desert's winds. Housecleaning 
has become virtually futile. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just gotten so disgusted," said Kott, standing with her husband on their 
dirt-covered back-yard patio. "It doesn't do any good. I'll clean this up, and 
it will be like this again in a few days. You just can't seem to keep ahead of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although severe, the problems in Kott's Palmdale neighborhood are hardly 
unique. Few places or people in the high desert this year have escaped being 
blanketed by the onslaught of dirt and sand that residents say is the worst 
they have seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds are nothing new to the high desert, but this year they have 
combined with a record fourth year of drought, a decline in the amount of 
acreage devoted to crops and the clearing of land for development to strip the 
soil from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted a public 
hearing about the desert's dust problems and decided to extend for another 18 
months its monitoring of air quality in the area. AQMD officials said, however, 
that the amount of dust in the Antelope Valley's air does not exceed federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 40 valley residents who attended the meeting disagreed with that 
assessment and said the experts' monitoring techniques have failed to detect 
the seriousness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In developed parts of the valley, where other structures or landscaping offer 
some protection from the wind and dirt, residents still have been forced to 
cover their pools and cars, and weatherproof their houses. Contact lens wearers 
have suffered from irritated and watery eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In areas exposed to the open desert or near construction sites, the problems 
have been more severe, forcing people indoors and covering their houses, 
furniture and floors with a layer of fine-grained dust and sand. For some, it 
has caused health problems to worsen. For almost everyone, it's meant a lot of 
cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
"The dirt gets on the sidewalks and the entrance way, and all over the house," 
said George Greene, a retired Lancaster aerospace engineer who blames 
developers for the severity of the dust problems and officials in Lancaster and 
Palmdale for failing to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The worst conditions have arisen near the rapidly growing area's many 
construction sites, where the ground cover has been removed and dirt is piled 
next to excavations. Residents say their complaints, however, aren't bringing 
any action. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have 
ordinances requiring construction sites to be dampened with water to control 
dirt and dust. But residents say the cities are slow to respond to complaints, 
and watering is, at best, a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they and developers do what they can but admit it's 
difficult. "Out here, trying to keep dust down in heavy winds is impossible. 
It's a fact of life unless you stop all of the construction" or plant grass 
everywhere, said Roy Stilson, a Palmdale public works inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some city and construction industry officials complain that another 
cause of the sandstorms has been animals that destroy vegetation by overgrazing 
vast areas of rangeland in the far west Antelope Valley. Occasionally powerful 
westerly winds then sweep up the dirt and deposit it miles away on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The drought also has been a major factor, leaving the region bone-dry and 
choking off desert vegetation that might otherwise have kept the topsoil in 
place. As a result, large sections of the valley have become virtual sand 
dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomena also have occurred this year in other Southern California 
desert areas. Because of unusually strong winds and dry conditions, heaps of 
blowing sand have closed roads and frustrated residents in the Riverside County 
communities of Palm Desert, Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year in the Antelope Valley, at least half-a-dozen windstorms with 
gusts up to 60 m.p.h. have raised towering clouds of sand and dirt and reduced 
visibility in some places to near zero, causing dozens of traffic collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions have also alarmed officials at Palmdale's commercial airport and 
the area's two military airports, Plant 42 in Palmdale and Edwards Air Force 
Base to the north. Officials there fear the blowing dirt could interfere with 
flight and testing activities. 
</P>
<P>
Large sandstorms have swept over the entire valley sporadically this year. But 
localized dust problems have occurred far more frequently near construction 
sites where even average-strength winds can pick up dirt exposed by 
excavations. Although smaller in scale, the dirt problems near construction 
sites can be intense, with mini-sand dunes piling up almost over night on front 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Wells said she knew nothing about such conditions when she and her 
husband moved from the South Bay to buy their first home in Lancaster about 1 
1/2 years ago. The young couple picked a house built across from a vacant lot 
and soon discovered open spaces aren't always an amenity. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt kicked up by a house builder on that property enveloped the neighborhood 
and forced the family to spend thousands of dollars to seal windows, replace 
carpeting and drapes and even repaint their new home's sandblasted exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Wellses and 10 other families were each awarded $1,850 in what 
Lancaster officials said was the first criminal case in the region in which a 
developer had been ordered to pay homeowners for damages caused by blowing 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Harold Smith of the Costa Mesa-based Rialto Development Co. pleaded no 
contest to one misdemeanor count under the city's ordinance and was ordered to 
begin paying each of the families in $100-a-month installments. But Wells said 
the families have yet to receive any money.

<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court jury has convicted a Thousand Oaks man of 89 
child molestation charges after he repeatedly abused two young girls over a 
period of six years. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ceballos, 57, was found guilty after the girls, now 11 and 15, 
testified that he attacked them between 1984 and his arrest in January. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos denied their accusations. 
</P>
<P>
The molestations were revealed when one girl complained to her teacher, who 
called police and the Ventura County Public Social Services Agency, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Ceballos guilty on Wednesday of 23 molestation charges involving 
the younger girl and 66 charges involving the older girl. 
</P>
<P>
His conviction included 13 charges of committing a lewd and lascivious act with 
a child age 14 or 15, each of which carries a maximum penalty of eight years in 
prison. Each of the others carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. 
Sentencing is scheduled Sept. 21. MACK REED

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : $70,000 REWARD OFFERED IN MURDER OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $70,000 reward was offered Thursday for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the killers of a Sepulveda woman who was stabbed to death after 
apparently surprising burglars in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gail Bronston, 49, a real estate agent, left work early on Dec. 7, 1989, 
went Christmas shopping and returned in mid-afternoon to her home. Her body was 
later found by her daughter in a rear bedroom. Two televisions, two video 
recorders and Bronston's Cadillac were stolen from the house. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities announced that rewards of $20,000 from the Bronston family, $25,000 
from the San Fernando Board of Realtors and $25,000 from the Los Angeles City 
Council have been offered for information.

OLD LENS GIVES WAY TO NEW AT LIGHTHOUSE 
</P>

After guiding sailors for 52 years with three flashes of light a minute, a 
brass-mounted crystal lens from the Anacapa Island lighthouse has been replaced 
by modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard on Wednesday turned the nine-foot circular lens over to the 
Channel Island National Park, which will display it in about a month at the 
island's visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
The new light is less attractive, but it will be easier to maintain, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight of the old-style lenses are used in 25 working lighthouses in 
California. One is at Port Hueneme, Coast Guard spokeswoman Helen Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, it has become increasingly difficult to find people to service 
the handmade lenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gradually having to replace them," Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anacapa lighthouse, the only one on the Channel Islands, has helped sailors 
navigate the Santa Barbara Channel since 1912. The lens, in place since 1938, 
was part of a system of lenses that rotated around a 1,000-watt light bulb, 
creating a flash every 20 seconds visible for 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The lens has been replaced by a plainer-looking parabolic reflector, Rear Adm. 
Marshall E. Gilbert said. The older type, called Fresnel lenses, "are really 
classic works of art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials displayed only the center of the lens at a reception Wednesday. 
Assembled, it consists of four pyramid-shaped lenses around the circular lens 
on a 40-inch steel base. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : RTD APPROVES FREE RIDES ON LATE BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The board of directors of the Rapid Transit District on Thursday approved a 
plan to provide free bus rides beginning next month for passengers picked up 15 
minutes or more late. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program, scheduled to run from Sept. 1 through Dec. 31, is designed 
to increase public confidence throughout Los Angeles County in the RTD. The 
district has suffered for years from bad publicity, ranging from violence to 
late-running buses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1984 Summer Olympics, RTD ridership has plummeted by about 500,000 
passengers from a high of 1.8 million daily. Officials concede a 60-cent fare 
hike in 1985, increasing the basic one-way fare to $1.10, drove off thousands 
of customers.

HOAXER CLAIMS TO HOLD HUSBANDS

<P>
Two women from Thousand Oaks are the latest targets of a man who calls married 
women, claims he has their husbands bound at gunpoint and sometimes demands 
$5,000 ransom, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 women in Camarillo, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks and Ventura have been 
contacted since July 25, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Scott Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the women's husbands have been abducted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The caller appears to select his victims from telephone book listings that 
include both spouses' first names, Miller said. All the calls were made between 
7 and 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Miller asked that anyone who receives such a call feign cooperation to get 
detailed information before hanging up and immediately contacting the Sheriff's 
Department. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

BRADLEY SENDS SIGNAL TO END TRAFFIC RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the city of Los Angeles seeking to slow the flow of traffic 
through their neighborhoods had better prepare themselves for long waits. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting of top officials in the city's Department of 
Transportation on Thursday, Mayor Tom Bradley decried the red tape delaying 
installation of crosswalks and traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 198 days just to consider requests for new traffic signals downtown, 
Bradley said. Slow as that seems, it's better than in West Los Angeles, where 
bureaucrats ponder such requests for 267 days. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, requests for new traffic lights take 225 days to be 
decided upon. 
</P>
<P>
And in the East San Fernando Valley, the department takes 272 to study requests 
for a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of delays are unacceptable," Bradley said. "I don't know what the 
reason is. I hope you don't tell me you need more personnel." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the delays, Bradley said he will hold similar meetings 
in the future and demand monthly or quarterly reports from transportation 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Los Angeles, he said, shouldn't be told "it will take eight or 
nine months" to review a crosswalk.

BIDS SOUGHT FOR NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fillmore Unified School District advertised for bids Thursday to build a 
scaled-down middle school. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Marlene Davis said the district recently received state approval to build 
a gymnasium and pavilion for junior high school students on property west of A 
Street near First Street. 
</P>
<P>
Classrooms, a library and offices were included in the original plans, but the 
district has been unable to obtain funding for the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
Former Fillmore Junior High Principal Mario Contini, now assistant 
superintendent of educational services, said the district's plan to combine 
sixth grade with the current seventh-and eighth-grade junior high and move the 
students to a new campus would have relieved overcrowding throughout the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
While the modified project will improve the athletic facilities, it will not 
reduce the number of students per classroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to find a way to build the full school," Contini said. 
"We're already bursting at the seams." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Fillmore voters approved a $5-million bond issue for the construction 
of a middle school. Davis said state funds were expected to make up the 
difference between the project's cost and the bond money. When it became 
apparent that no state funds would be available, the district tried to pass a 
second bond issue for an additional $8 million, which voters rejected in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we've decided to build as much as we can with the money we have 
available," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis declined to speculate when construction might begin, but estimated that 
the gymnasium and pavilion/eating area would take about a year to build. JANET

STATE, DEVELOPER IN BATTLE OF THE SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a dusty hike through Fryman Canyon with an entourage of environmentalists 
and aides on Thursday, the head of a state parks agency accused developer Fred 
Sahadi of illegally posting no-trespassing signs in the Studio City canyon, and 
vowed to seek their removal. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
also speculated that posting the signs on a heavily used trail was 
"intentionally" designed "to ratchet up things to get more attention and more 
money" as Sahadi jockeys to sell the canyon to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi could not be reached for a reply. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy, with help from the city of Los Angeles, has been negotiating 
to buy the entire woodsy canyon just below Mulholland Drive in Studio City from 
Sahadi and block his plans to build 26 luxury homes on the site. 
</P>
<P>
But after weeks of talks, Sahadi informed Edmiston on Wednesday that he was 
breaking off negotiations, convinced that the city was unwilling to contribute 
$2 million of its own toward purchasing the canyon. Sahadi has said his 
rock-bottom price is $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Edmiston and Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the 
area, said that they believed Sahadi can be brought back to the bargaining 
table. "It's just legal posturing," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edmiston said he would ask the state attorney general's office today 
to sue to prevent Sahadi from posting no-trespassing signs on 32 acres of 
Fryman Canyon that Edmiston said should belong to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston spoke as he stood before two no-trespassing signs on a trail through 
the canyon. Conferring with an aide over a detailed topographical map, Edmiston 
declared that the signs were on property Sahadi was supposed to have deeded to 
the conservancy in 1986, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
His aide told Edmiston that a half-dozen other signs were posted on the same 
disputed property. 
</P>
<P>
The city had agreed to see that Sahadi donated the 32 acres to the conservancy 
for open space as a condition of getting important city land-use approvals. 
However, for reasons still unknown, the property never was deeded to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi has said he will deed the property to the conservancy after he has 
finished his project. Sahadi's plans show that he intends to build a temporary 
road across the 32 acres. The road is needed for access for the major grading 
work he plans for the site. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the conservancy also is likely to sue Sahadi in a separate 
lawsuit to obtain title to the 32 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The recent posting of no-trespassing signs, an armed guard at the canyon, and 
the tagging of trees for destruction by construction crews have heightened the 
anguish of environmentalists seeking to save Fryman. Several of them blocked 
the road earlier in the week -- one woman parking her Mercedes Benz in front of 
the gate -- to keep workers off the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Sahadi is trying to antagonize and intimidate the neighbors and others out 
here so they'll put pressure on the city to pay him whatever he wants for his 
property," said Ann Rushton, staff counsel for the Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether such a strategy, if it exists, is working.

2 SUSPECTS HELD IN ROBBERY AND RAPE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A CHANCE SIGHTING IN A COURTROOM BY AN ALERT DETECTIVE LED TO ARRESTS 
SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEN WERE TO BE FREED.

When Beverly Hills Detective Tom Linehan spotted the two men in court, they 
were waiting to be set free after charges against them were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Yet their appearances -- one short and the other nearly 6 feet tall -- reminded 
Linehan of the descriptions of two men who had invaded a Beverly Hills home two 
months earlier, beaten and robbed several people and savagely raped a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Linehan, a robbery-homicide detective, returned to the police station, compared 
the two men's appearances with artist's sketches, ran a fingerprint check and 
hurried back to court within hours on Tuesday. He arrested Altin Louis 
Jefferson, 19, and Keith Cortez Miller, 29, both of Los Angeles, just hours 
before they were to have been set free. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two face charges of kidnaping, burglary, robbery, grand theft auto, 
assault with a deadly weapon and rape as suspects in an incident that began 
near midnight June 12 when a car bumped a 1989 Cadillac Seville from behind at 
a stop sign on a Beverly Hills street. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Robert Curtis, this is what happened next: 
</P>
<P>
Two men, one carrying a rifle, came out of the rear car and forced their way 
into the Cadillac. A 30-year-old domestic had borrowed the car from a friend, 
and her 32-year-old boyfriend was driving it. 
</P>
<P>
"While in the car, they beat and robbed them and forced the woman to lead them 
to the home where she worked," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
At the house, in the 300 block of South Rodeo Drive, the kidnapers forced the 
boyfriend into the Cadillac's trunk and took the maid to the front door to get 
into the house, where they found six other people, four men and two women. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat these people and robbed them and, at one point, forced a male 
resident to lead them downstairs to a safe," Curtis said. "They tied everyone 
up on the kitchen floor." 
</P>
<P>
The intruders brought the maid's boyfriend in from the trunk of the car, bound 
him and forced him to join the others on the kitchen floor. Then, Curtis said, 
they took the maid to a bedroom and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
While they were away, he said, two accomplices -- a man and a woman who had 
been in the rear car during the bumping incident and had followed the Cadillac 
to the home -- stood guard over the trussed victims. 
</P>
<P>
After about an hour and 15 minutes, the four left the house. One of them drove 
away in the Cadillac. The car was found burning in the 1600 block of West 51st 
Street a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives worked the case for weeks and were without suspects until Linehan, 
who happened to be in court on another matter, saw the pair in court: Miller, 
who is 5 feet, 11 inches tall and 180 pounds, and Jefferson, who stands 5 feet, 
5 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The two had been arrested in Beverly Hills shortly before midnight Aug. 18, 
when police said they found a hidden gun, along with handcuffs and tape, in 
their car. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked on suspicion of robbery. But prosecutors refused to file 
robbery charges for lack of evidence, and Jefferson and Miller were back in 
court to be ordered released. 
</P>
<P>
Each is now being held on $350,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators are searching for the two others involved in the June 
incident, and looking into possible similarities between that and other crimes 
in which robbers have intruded into Westside homes.

NFL, NETWORKS SAY OUTCRY WON'T HALT SCRAMBLING 
</P>

<P>
Officials for the NFL and the major television networks said Thursday that they 
were stunned by the response of sports-bar owners angered over the scrambling 
of NFL telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
But league and network officials also said that, despite the national outcry, 
scrambling would not be reversed and no option to "de-scramble" would be made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"This story has been picked up all over America, and indeed, the response has 
been surprising . . . overwhelming," said Val Pinchbeck, the NFL's vice 
president in charge of broadcasting. "But we're not going to change what we 
started. We and the networks agreed we would move toward scrambling, and that 
we have done." 
</P>
<P>
Pinchbeck said National Football Conference games carried on CBS would be 
"fully scrambled" by the start of the season Sept. 9. He said scrambling of NBC 
telecasts involving the American Football Conference would be complete "at 
least by mid-season." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Home Box Office, ESPN, TNT and cable outlets offering "de-scrambling" 
packages, in which subscribers buy a decoder and also pay a fee, the NFL plans 
no such option "at any point in the future," Pinchbeck said, adding that only 
local affiliates would have the ability to receive network games. 
</P>
<P>
Sports-bar owners have in the past attracted customers with rooting interests 
in NFL teams in other parts of the country by showing games not available 
through local affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's, a family-oriented 
restaurant that prides itself on its Chicago sports theme, said he had been 
named chairman of a Southern California organization called the Assn. for 
Sports Fans' Rights. The group held its first meeting in Hillcrest Monday 
night, and more than 40 people -- including eight lawyers -- attended. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said his group had joined forces with Sports Fans of America, a 
Miami-based organization that has waged war in the courtroom over the showing 
of Dolphins games "blacked out" in Southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard from organizations in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New 
Orleans, San Francisco . . . These people are outraged," said Lebovitz, who 
operates Sluggo's in three San Diego locations and has traditionally drawn 
large crowds for telecasts of regional NFL games involving the Bears. "I'm 
talking to hundreds who represent thousands. It seems grass-roots America is 
taking this as a personal offense." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said he had heard from constituents outraged over 
the NFL's decision. As a member of the House Committee of Energy and Commerce, 
Bates said he planned to ask the subcommittee on telecommunications to 
investigate NFL scrambling and decide whether it was legally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have real reservations about it," Bates said. "So I'm considering 
legislation to prevent the league from doing it. At this point, it depends on 
public reaction. If it continues to come down soundly against the NFL, I think 
the bill can pass. It seems to me the NFL got hysterical and is going against 
the majority and the needs of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kerr, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said from New York that scrambling 
was done at the request of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL asks us to do it, because it protects the interests of the home team," 
Kerr said. "If you're with the Rams organization and somebody in Southern 
California has the capability of sitting home or going to a sports bar and 
watching multiple games, that threatens attendance of Rams' home games. 
Scrambling protects the popularity of local teams." 
</P>
<P>
But Pinchbeck says the opposite, that scrambling was a "condition" spelled out 
by the networks in the four-year, $3.6-billion agreement that takes effect this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And Jay Rosenstein, vice president for sports programming at CBS, said that 
scrambling had been the "mandate" of local affiliates to the networks since 
negotiations for the new agreement began. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has its own reasons for wanting to protect its copyright," Rosenstein 
said from New York. "We have a number of issues vis a vis the network-affiliate 
relationship. When you spend that kind of money ($1.5 billion by CBS alone) to 
provide football to local affiliates, you expect the games to be watched. The 
opportunity to sell commercials in those games is a way of getting back our 
rather substantial investment." 
</P>

Rooftop "dishes" that pick up signals beamed from satellites receive only 
network feeds, and not the broadcasts of local stations. Thus, users of such 
technology don't see local and regional commercials. (National, network 
commercials are fed via satellite.) 
</P>
<P>
A senior official at NBC, requesting anonymity, said the networks demanded 
scrambling because of the threat represented by dish owners and patrons of 
sports bars to the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"If every football fan in America went to sports bars to watch the games, there 
would be nobody at home watching games," the official said from New York. 
"That's what we want, that's what we live by -- people at home watching games. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers don't pay the dish owner. They pay the networks and the local 
affiliates. If you're not watching at home, you represent an audience that 
can't be measured -- by the Nielsen ratings or any other survey I know of." 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz, the San Diego restaurateur, said attorneys for the Assn. of Sports 
Fans' Rights are "exploring the possibility" of obtaining an injunction to 
prevent scrambling on Sept. 9. He said that the "1,000 or so" sports bars 
across America would "simply go out of business" if scrambling is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the NFL is vulnerable in the antitrust area."

Only one point separates David Houser of the Coronado Yacht Club, Mike Hare of 
Houston and Brett Davis of St. Petersburg, Fla., going into today's final race 
of the single-handed Laser class in the U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex National 
Junior Championships at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Davis started slowly in the five-day, 10-race series but won four consecutive 
races before placing second in the ninth race Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With low score winning, Hare is now the leader with 22 points to 22 3/4 for 
Houser and 23 for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
First place is worth three-quarters of a point, and subsequent places equate to 
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hardesty of the Mission Bay Yacht Club, with crewman Paul Ware, slipped to 
fourth -- their worst finish all week -- in the first of two Flying Junior 
races but won the second to retain first overall with two races remaining 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Hardesty is 3 1/2 points ahead of second-place Jesse Andrews of the American 
Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. Third place is 15 1/2 points behind Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Elting of Houston took over the lead in the Etchells 22 fleet when Jory 
Twist of the host Newport Harbor Yacht Club was disqualified for a premature 
start in Thursday's first race. Manning Montagnet of Pass Christian YC in 
Mississippi also started early but won the next race, with Twist second. 
</P>
<P>
Twist dropped to third overall, four points behind Elting, but still has a 
chance to win with his performance in today's two races under the scoring 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The fleets enjoyed their strongest wind conditions of the week, 10 to 15 knots.

Class winners here will be members of the U.S. junior national team. BOB DUKE

HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE A REGULAR JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Flanagan, who holds the career scoring record for the Cal State Dominguez 
Hills soccer team, has found it difficult to get into a game in his first 
professional season with the Los Angeles Heat. He has started two games, played 
in six and has scored only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Heat, who have had difficulty scoring goals, play the California 
Emperors on Saturday at 3 p.m. at the University of Redlands, Flanagan might 
prove to be a pivotal player, as he was on Monday against Real Santa Barbara. A 
surprise starter in the midfield, he created several opportunities for his 
teammates as the Heat won, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan also got the start in the ensuing mini-game that the Heat won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"He was steady," general manager Jill Fracisco said. "He didn't let anyone 
down. He made no major errors." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the L.A.-California game, which decides the Southern Division 
title of the American Professional Soccer League West, advances to play the 
Northern Division champion in a home-and-home series. The Heat (11-9) twice 
defeated the Emperors (10-10) in overtime this season, but California has won 
seven consecutive games since losing to the Heat on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Emperors climbed out of the cellar to win the Southern Division title. The 
Heat, which briefly fell into last place as California moved upward, clawed 
back and finished second. Despite having a poorer overall record, the Emperors 
scored three more goals than the Heat to win the division title. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring goals in playoff games is always more difficult because teams often sit 
back and bunch in front of the net. Scoring hasn't been the Heat's forte all 
season. In 20 regular season games, L.A. managed only 29 goals, although in its 
past four games it has scored 10. Flanagan will try to add to that, one way or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing I offer the Heat is that I give them my best work rate," he 
said. "I want to make a difference, whatever it is, I just don't want to go out 
on the field and be a statistic." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat will be without spirited defender Danny Pena, who will sit out the 
game because he has accumulated five yellow cards. Also expected to miss the 
game is midfielder Mike Getchell, another player with five yellow cards. The 
Heat filed a protest over the Getchell matter, but should he be unavailable, it 
will more than likely be Flanagan who starts at center half. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my chance," Flanagan said. "It's the thing I dream about." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan has heard his name shouted from the stands several times this year as 
he took his seat on the Heat bench. South Bay soccer fans remember his scoring 
prowess at West Torrance High and Cal State Dominguez Hills, where he scored 38 
career goals and in 1988 helped the Toros to a share of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco insists Flanagan's time will come. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the very talented players we have on this team, it's unfortunate that 
anyone has to sit," she said. "Joe has proven against top professional players 
that he can play (in practice). He has really come around." 
</P>
<P>
Against California, Flanagan has extra incentive. He would like nothing better 
than to collect a ball in the midfield, dribble up the middle and turn toward 
the goal from 15 yards out. He would see goalkeeper Chris Wilson, a former high 
school and college teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Chris and he knows me," said Flanagan. "I would love nothing better 
than to stick one in the back of the net." 
</P>
<P>
They remain the best of friends. Earlier this summer they worked together at 
youth soccer camps and Flanagan spent much of his free time this past week with 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's odd that all the time we were together in high school and college we 
never got to play together in the playoffs," Flanagan said. "But here we are, 
our first year out of college and we will be playing against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Even if he does not play Saturday, Flanagan thinks he has solidified his future 
as a professional player. He also thinks the Heat can continue its winning 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be creating things, playing within our roles, not overdoing 
things." he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan is just hoping to have a chance to contribute to a victory.

FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE COACH STUCK PLAYING IN DIVISION II, BUT NCAA PLAN COULD 
SERVE TO ELEVATE HIS PROGRAM'S STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly two years, football has been the "but" end of the Cal State 
Northridge athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
"Beginning in the fall of 1990," it was said repeatedly, "Northridge will begin 
competing at the NCAA Division I level in all sports but football . . ." 
</P>
<P>
That situation could change within the next few years. Through no choice of its 
own, Northridge may, in effect, be forced into Division I football. 
</P>
<P>
At the NCAA's annual convention in January, delegates will consider a plan that 
would require football-playing Division I schools to compete in that sport in 
one of three classifications -- Division I-A, Division I-AA or the proposed 
Division I-AAA. 
</P>
<P>
Should such an arrangement be approved, it would force the Division II Western 
Football Conference -- of which Northridge is a member -- to disband. Five of 
the WFC's six members either are or will be competing in Division I by the fall 
of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave Northridge with five choices: 
</P>
<P>
* Play Division I-A football (e.g., the Big West Conference). 
</P>
<P>
* Play Division I-AA football (e.g., the Big Sky Conference). 
</P>
<P>
* Enter Division I-AAA and play the equivalent of what is now NCAA Division III 
football. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep football as it is and return the rest of its teams to the Division II 
level. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminate football. 
</P>
<P>
The last three options are not considered viable by school officials. For 
starters, Northridge would not qualify for Division I-AAA status because the 
scholarship limit that has been proposed for that level is 20. A state-system 
school such as Northridge likely would exceed funding for that number in 
non-athletic financial aid alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't live with that," said Bob Burt, CSUN football coach. 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said for options four and five. Slinking back to Division II 
would be a public-relations disaster and eliminating football altogether would 
contradict the school's stated mission of keeping athletics on par with 
burgeoning programs in fields such as business and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping up to 1-A or 1-AA level would not be cheap. A bigger stadium and a 
larger scholarship budget would be required. 
</P>
<P>
Among NCAA stipulations for a Division I-A independent in football is that the 
school play in a stadium with a capacity of at least 30,000. Northridge already 
has plans for such a facility as part of its University Park expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves a scholarship increase as the most substantial hurdle CSUN must 
clear. Northridge has 24 athletic scholarships for football, which it slices, 
dices and distributes -- usually in increments of $1,000 -- among about 70 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Counting other need-based financial aid, Northridge will distribute the 
equivalent of about 35 scholarships for football this season. The NCAA maximum 
for Division I-A is 95. In Division I-AA, it's 70. 
</P>
<P>
However, if university presidents have their way -- and there is every 
indication that they will -- scholarship levels in both Division I-A and I-AA 
will be reduced at January's convention. The new Division I-A maximum is 
expected to fall by 10 or 15. The Division I-AA limit may drop to as low as 50. 
</P>
<P>
The formula for CSUN's competitiveness at a higher level is a simple one, Burt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarships plus stadium equals success. "If we have both of those, then I 
think it's a very sensible move for our university to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burt imagines a Pacific 10 Conference school such as Stanford playing 
Northridge in a modern 30,000-seat stadium filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a growing process, but it can be done," he added, recalling that San Jose 
State once defeated both Cal and Stanford in the same season. "If we had a 
stadium and were consistently competing on a good level . . . You have to 
envision the kinds of things that are possible here." 
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, Burt says he will simply ignore the Division II label the 
football program carries. 
</P>
<P>
"When we line up to play (Cal State) Long Beach or (Cal State) Fullerton or 
Northern Arizona it doesn't make a damned bit of difference what division we 
are," Burt said. "If we beat them, fine. If we don't, well, that's not good 
whether we're Division I or II. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a conference. We have a chance to go to a playoff. We have a 
conference championship to shoot for. What division it's in doesn't matter."

TENNIS / PAIGE A. LEECH: NET GALS WILL TAKE A SWING AT A NATIONAL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Net Gals became the first San Fernando Valley team to qualify for the 
USTA/Volvo Team Tennis national championship after beating the Lomas Loonies of 
north San Diego County, 3-2, in a sectional playoff final last weekend at Los 
Caballeros Sports Village in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since this Team Tennis league began nearly a decade ago, no Valley team -- 
men's or women's -- had advanced beyond sectional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.0-division Net Gals, composed of 14 area women ranging in age from 37 to 
58, beat Ventura County, 5-0, and Orange County, 3-2, to advance to the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the sectional final, Heidi Broecking of the Net Gals defeated Karen Gray, 
6-1, 6-2, in singles. 
</P>
<P>
The Net Gals also scored doubles victories with the No. 1 team of Doreen 
Goldberg and Edda Speisser, who defeated Sonia Meyers and Cynthia Thornton, 
6-4, 6-4, and the No. 3 doubles team of Beverly Lever and Laura Pearl, who beat 
Helen Bock and Jamie Gahara, 6-1, 7-5, to clinch the title. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Minor, a member of the Net Gals and the Valley coordinator, said the 
competition at the 4.0 level was tough. 
</P>
<P>
"For these singles players to compete against these teams was just incredible," 
Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
Minor said that most of the other 4.0 teams feature several younger players, 
many of whom had played in college. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the team include captain Karen Gaffney, Myrna Craig, Val Hait, 
Lily Reeves, Tina Clarfield, Patricia Harris, Edith Stefel, and June 
Sugasawara. 
</P>
<P>
The national championship matches, which will be played at the Double Tree 
Resort in Palm Springs, Oct. 25-28, will feature 17 teams from the United 
States and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament winners: Roscoe Tanner and Yorgen Janson of Westlake Village 
defeated the team of Dan Hanson and Tom Smith of Walnut, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in the 
men's 35-and-over doubles at the Mammoth Lakes Open Tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Janson also made it to the singles final, but was defeated by Riverside's Dick 
Johnsrud, 6-4, 7-5, in the men's 45-and-over division. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner, 38, a Wimbledon finalist in 1979, prefers friendly competition to the 
big-dollar tournaments of today. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, I learned tennis as a sport first," Tanner said. "To me, (the 
Mammoth Lakes Open) was what tennis is all about -- no prize money, just a 
bunch of tennis players who are interested in having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Fast serves: Valley tennis players had the chance to clock the speed of their 
serves over the weekend at clinics in Studio City and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 players showed for the Wilson/Eagle Tennis Fest at the Cabrillo 
Racquet Club in Camarillo on Sunday afternoon to receive instruction and clock 
their serves. Mark Ellis, 17, the No. 1 player at Camarillo High, had the 
fastest serve of the day -- 118 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's clinic at The Racquet Centre in Studio City, about 50 people 
took part in the free instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson and Eagle companies sponsor 72 similar events across the country, 
donating $2,000 worth of merchandise a session to be used as prizes for 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Team Tennis: Of the six Southern California teams competing at this 
weekend's Junior Team Tennis state championships, two are from the Cabrillo 
Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
The top six Southern California teams will meet the best from Northern 
California at the Industry Hills Tennis Center on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Monique Allegre, Jessica Improta, Shera Wiegler, Jennifer Messmer, Arezoo 
Jafroodi, Lisa Sunwoo and Stefany Wolfsohn make up the Cabrillo club's 
15-and-under team. Members of the girls' 12-and under team are Rhi Potkey, Lulu 
Oswald, Sarah Distad, Katie Messmer, Sally Distad and Shannon Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Racquet Club is no newcomer to the state playoffs. The 
12-and-under girls' team won the state title in 1988, and the boys' team 
followed with a title of its own in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Clay court player: Mark Simon of North Hollywood will compete in the final 
rounds of the 10th Southern California Clay Court Tournament in Irvine over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, 15, who trains at The Racquet Centre in Studio City, is coming off a 
championship victory in the 16-and-under Thousand Oaks Tournament last month. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura tennis: The 26th Ventura County Tennis Championships are Saturday and 
Sunday at the Pierpont Racquet Club in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The championship is the eighth in a series of 14 events of the Ventura Grand 
Prix.

Thousand Oaks of the Marmonte League, which returns 14 lettermen, ranks No. 5 
in the Division II poll after an 11-1-1 season in '89. League rival Westlake, 
led by quarterback Todd Preston, is ranked No. 9 and Ventura of the Channel 
League and Channel Islands of the Marmonte League are listed in teams to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Foothill League power Hart, with 23 returning lettermen and coming 
off a 10-2 season, is ranked No. 7 in the Division III poll and Notre Dame, 
making the jump from Division VII to Division III in the new Mission League, is 
ranked No. 8. 
</P>
<P>

FIELDS FINDS USOC OUTREACH ASSISTANCE SIMPLY OUT OF REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farron Fields of Northridge is not the first person it's happened to, and he 
certainly won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
But Fields' rejection as a candidate for financial assistance via the U.S. 
Olympic Committee's Outreach Program points out some of the problems facing 
post-collegiate track and field athletes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, who graduated from Granada Hills High in 1979, is not likely to win an 
Olympic gold medal or set a world record during his career, but he is among the 
top 15-20 distance runners in the country. 
</P>
<P>
He has timed 28 minutes 45.9 seconds in the 10,000 meters this year, placed 
10th in the 10,000 at The Athletics Congress championships in June and third in 
the same event at the Olympic Festival in July. 
</P>
<P>
Those accomplishments should entitle him to some kind of financial support, but 
they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Fields applied to the USOC's Outreach Program, which finds 
jobs for athletes and allows them to work part time (20-30 hours a week), but 
to receive a salary for a full week's work. Last week, however, he received a 
form letter from TAC -- which decides whether to accept applicants -- informing 
him that he wasn't a "viable" Olympic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they do it really makes you feel like dirt," Fields said. "They had 
underlined the word viable in red. . . . It's not like I'm asking for free 
money. I just need a job that allows me some time to train." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with USOC support programs is that they cater too much to the elite 
athletes and not enough to the up-and-coming and journeyman ones. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes who consistently rank among the top 10 in the world in their 
respective events, such as Carl Lewis, Roger Kingdom and Evelyn Ashford, don't 
need financial help from the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
They make a pretty good -- in some cases great -- living from appearance fees 
and shoe contracts, yet the USOC designs its programs to their advantage 
although it's athletes such as Fields who need financial help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to run for another five years," said Fields, 28. "But a lot depends 
on what happens with the money situation. I need to start making some money, 
but if I get a full-time job, I'm afraid I'll be too tired and busy to train 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Scorpion watch: Abe Valdez, who finished fourth in the 1989 State Division I 
cross-country championships for Camarillo High, will run for Central Arizona, a 
two-year college in Coolidge, in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez, who led Camarillo to the State Division I team title in cross-country, 
was offered an athletic scholarship by Nebraska, but the offer was withdrawn 
when he failed to meet the NCAA's Proposition 48 requirements. 
</P>
<P>
He was the Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 3,200 meters and 
placed sixth in that event at the state championships in June. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez's personal best of 9 minutes 1 second in the 3,200 ranks him sixth on 
this year's national high school list. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: Valdez's best in the 3,200 converts to a 9:04.19 two-mile, 
more than 20 seconds off the Camarillo school record. 
</P>
<P>
Who holds the record and in what year did he set it? 
</P>
<P>
New Charger in town: Bryan Dameworth graduated in June and highly regarded 
senior Quentin Bauer might not run because of other interests, but Agoura Coach 
Bill Duley isn't worried about how his cross-country forces will fare when the 
Chargers move into the traditionally strong Marmonte League this season. 
</P>
<P>
Duley has some high-quality returning lettermen from last year's team, which 
finished third in the State Division I championships, and some talented 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to the new league," said Duley, who led Agoura to 
Frontier League boys' titles the past four years. "I think it may help keep the 
kids more motivated during the season. In the Frontier League, the kids never 
had to worry about meets. But that's not going to be the case now. . . . 
They'll have to be sharp every week." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Mike Cherman, who finished 27th in last year's state cross-country meet, 
is Agoura's top returning runner, but Duley is high on sophomore Ryan Wilson, a 
running back on the freshman team last year who ran 52 seconds for 440 yards on 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see how he runs the first couple of meets, but I think he's 
going to be a good one," said Duley, who coached Dameworth to three State 
Division I cross-country titles and senior Deena Drossin to two. "He's built 
like Bryan and he's been running right with Mike in workouts." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Eric Reynolds ran 8:44.0 in 1983. Reynolds won the 3,200 meters 
at the 1983 state track championships in 8:54.75.

ZAMBRI ACES FIRST TEST IN U.S. AMATEUR

Defending champion Chris Patton made an early exit from the U. S. Amateur golf 
championship Thursday, losing the first five holes to Westlake High graduate 
Chris Zambri and finally succumbing on his opponent's hole in one, 8 and 6, in 
the first round of match play at Cherry Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Zambri, who will be a junior at USC in the fall, parred the first four holes 
and birdied the fifth to move 5-up. 
</P>
<P>
Patton three-putted his first three holes. 
</P>
<P>
Zambri went to 6-up with a par at No. 7, but Patton won the ninth with a par to 
make the turn at 5-down. The next two holes went to Zambri, with a birdie and 
par. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Zambri ended the match in dramatic fashion by sending his five-iron 
shot on the 204-yard 12th hole into the cup for an ace. Zambri wound up three 
under par through 12 holes and called it "probably the best day I've ever had 
on a golf course." 
</P>
<P>
Zambri admitted he was nervous throughout the match. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big gallery out there and I've probably never played before more 
than 10 people," he said. "I tried to play every shot and not look ahead. I 
didn't want to see the headline: 'Patton comes back, kid chokes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zambri, 19, who lives in Thousand Oaks, will face USC teammate Bryan Pemberton 
of Dublin, Calif., in the second round today. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Voges of Simi Valley was defeated, 3 and 2, by Michael Swingle of 
Seattle.

A PRICELESS 'LOOT' COMES TO S.D. REP

<P>
It's a wicked world we live in. And don't the characters in "Loot" enjoy every 
wicked moment in it? 
</P>
<P>
Joe Orton's farce about Hal and Dennis, two polite young bank robbers who use 
Hal's soon-to-be-buried mother's coffin to stash their cash, is one of those 
comedies that try the soul. 
</P>
<P>
These fellows have no redeeming qualities, and you know you shouldn't laugh 
when Dennis trips over a glass eye that slips out of the embalmed body, but, by 
then, Orton has you so wired into his weird sense of humor that it would be 
downright painful to resist. 
</P>
<P>
A sterling production of this black comedy is playing at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Stage through Sept. 8. It is directed by Walter 
Schoen with a clarity that makes the actors' performances sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't see characters you love, you will certainly see reflections of 
public characters that you love to loathe. 
</P>
<P>
If the humor must be justified, one can point out that Orton's target is 
hypocrisy -- a commodity that has not diminished since Orton wrote the play a 
quarter century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We must keep up appearances" is the key phrase in the play. 
</P>
<P>
And there's piety, too. But this piety is like the "piety" we hear today from 
adulterous evangelists or sanctimonious politicians most interested in 
fattening their own wallets. It is only word deep. 
</P>
<P>
In "Loot," the Bible-quoting nurse, Fay -- exquisitely played by perky and 
perfectly coiffed Diana Castle -- is a patient-killer out for her 8th husband 
in 10 years. The blonde Castle has the wholesome look of Doris Day, but Fay is, 
if anything, Doris Day's evil twin. As soon as Hal's mother is in her coffin, 
she has her eyes on Hal's father, a new widower. 
</P>
<P>
The widower, played by Maury Cooper with a straight and narrow vigor that makes 
him the center of the storm that surrounds him, is the only one in the play to 
respect authority and religion. But even this high-minded gentleman is 
eminently blackmailable. He is so threatened by the nurse's supposed claim to 
his wife's money that he promises to propose to the nurse on the way to the 
cemetery just to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Matthews masterfully finds a way to lend shades of feeling to the unfeeling 
Hal. He exudes a delicious attitude just in the way he listens -- you know by 
the look on his face when someone is giving him a line. And as Dennis, Hal's 
doleful partner in crime, master pratfaller Bruce McKenzie doesn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
But the yummiest part belongs to Truscott, the detective masquerading as a 
water board inspector because, as a water board inspector, he doesn't need the 
search warrant no one will give him to pursue these crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Oleniacz has a great time with Orton's parody of a detective, out-Holmesing 
Sherlock and out-Columboing Columbo. How does Truscott guess that Fay killed 
one of her previous husbands in a seaside resort hotel? When he shook her hand 
and felt the salty erosion on one of her rings . . . well, you'll just have to 
hear the clever exposition for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
A witty technical team supports this excellent cast. Thomas Buderwitz wisely 
built an elegant, tastefully furnished set that fills just half of the Rep's 
stage and creates an intimate feel. Emelle Holmes did the eye-catching, 
stylishly bright costumes, Diane Boomer the fine lighting, Lawrence Czoka the 
parody of a sanctimonious sound design. 
</P>
<P>
If a subtle sadness radiates beneath the humor here, it comes because Orton 
knew something of the violence that can lurk beneath good manners. And, sadly, 
the price of his own fame was to be murdered by his longtime mentor, companion 
and lover, Kenneth Halliwell, at age 34 in 1967, soon after writing "What the 
Butler Saw" and just two years after writing "Loot." 
</P>
<P>
Halliwell, who at one time co-wrote novels with Orton, was evidently jealous of 
Orton's fame and killed himself right after the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Love and hate, fame and jealousy, lies and truth: Orton knew these things were 
inextricably intertwined in this most imperfect of worlds. In "Loot," a 
masterly contrast between good manners and bad deeds, he allows us to look and 
laugh at how life's contradictions intertwine. But, slyly, this master of farce 
doesn't allow us to forget the sometimes deadly consequences of the mix. 
</P>
<P>

AT THE GALLERIES: GHOST OF FRIDA KAHLO HAUNTS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1988, La Jolla's Iturralde Gallery (then La Casa del Arte) showed a series 
of lithographs by Lucia Maya that were inspired by the extraordinarily prolific 
and passionate life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Maya's affinity for Kahlo's 
precise, naturalistic style of rendering and her symbolic, surreal imagery made 
the series as much a dialogue between kindred spirits as a homage to a 
legendary life. 
</P>
<P>
This month, an extensive selection of Maya's paintings, prints and drawings can 
be seen at the Centro Cultural Tijuana in a show titled "Umbral de las 
Transfiguraciones" (Threshold of Transfigurations). Though Kahlo's striking 
visage is nowhere to be found here, her pointed, poignant approach is present 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Maya, who was born on Catalina Island and now lives in Guadalajara, never 
musters the same blend of toughness and vulnerability that makes Kahlo's work 
so singularly intriguing. Her intent, though, differs substantially. The mood 
she consistently creates is less intimate and revealing than Kahlo's and, 
instead, feels like a melange of received styles: saccharine sweetness, Gothic 
horror and surreal poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Maya's debt to the heritage of surrealism runs the deepest, especially in her 
use of familiar forms such as the human heart, in disjunctive, startling 
contexts. The heart appears throughout her work -- as vital organ, container of 
the 
</P>
<P>
soul, the spirit, and source of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
In the drawing, "Epifania de la Tierra" (Epiphany of the Earth), hearts sprout 
from the soil like saplings yearning for the sun. On the horizon of this 
fertile field, uprooted trees soar into a sky charged with unrest. In the 
foreground, a young woman unearths one of the hearts to find a child's pair of 
legs attached. Her wide-eyed innocence mirrors our own before this bizarre 
vision of birth and tempestuous demise. 
</P>
<P>
Maya makes an analogy between the heart's arteries and a tree's branches in 
several images, part of a larger expression of her view of the affinity between 
human and organic realms. Two large, dynamic drawings of trees double as 
portraits of twisting torsos, rooted to the ground but with branches/arms 
reaching upward, striving for a higher reality. In "Madre Corazon" (Heart 
Mother), one of three delicate drawings on the theme of maternal, life-giving 
power, Maya substitutes a heart and healthy foliage for a woman's head and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
The most profound use of the image of the heart appears in the painting, 
"Exodo" (Exodus), one of the quietest but most moving works in the show. A 
gray-haired man stands against a screen of tall, mist-enshrouded trees, his 
pale hazel eyes staring wistfully ahead. Beneath his arm he carries a small 
house, with a roof resembling a human heart and walls frayed into a web of 
ungrounded roots. A small patch of earth near him is stained red, indicating, 
perhaps, the site of the unrooting. "Exodo" illustrates in simple terms the 
adage that home is where the heart is, while also conveying a more complex and 
powerful portrait of loss, separation and exile. 
</P>
<P>
Maya layers seemingly incongruous emotional and physical states throughout her 
work, evoking images both provocative and unsettling. Often she wraps her 
female figures in white, cocoon-like shrouds, linking them to both nascent and 
decaying states. They lie immobile, in a permanent dream state, the favorite 
realm of the founders of surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
Death and life shadow each other closely here, two facets of the same evolving 
entity called existence. Their transfiguration from one into the other is 
rendered seamless in the painting, "Concepcion Inmaculada" (Immaculate 
Conception), where an auburn-maned woman and a similarly coiffed skeleton share 
a single white, billowing smock, bloated by the figure's pregnancy. The cycle 
of birth and death becomes truly circular here, part of a continuum played out 
at once by a single individual. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Maya's work is, indeed, rich with poetic possibilities, but much is 
also mired in a stiff sentimentality. Her languorous sirens and brooding lovers 
drip with melodrama, cheap and over-acted, and her tight, linear drawing style 
sometimes stiffens and becomes static and lifeless. Underlying all of her work, 
however, is the potent realization that life and death, love and loss, the 
human and the organic all nurture each other while deepening each others' 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Lucia Maya's work can be seen at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (on Paseo de los 
Heroes) through Aug. 31. Also on view in a separate show, through Aug. 29, is a 
strong selection of prints on the theme of the Mexican revolution.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: STARLIGHT MAY RESURRECT USO ERA FOR 
NEW MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Starlight Musical Theatre has been talking about doing a new show for years. 
Now it looks as if the company has finally made its choice -- a still untitled 
musical about the United Service Organization (USO) in Southern California at 
the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Starlight commissioned the musical from Anthony Stimac, founder and artistic 
director of Musical Theatre Works in New York, and tested out the show in a 
staged reading last Saturday at San Diego City College in the fourth workshop 
of its 1990 Prelude series. 
</P>
<P>
The story follows the lives of three women performers who fall in love with 
servicemen and follow them to the South Pacific. While new music was written 
for it by Peter Ekstrom and lyricist Steve Hays, the story draws heavily from 
classic songs, including "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," "Over There" and 
"You're in the Army Now." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Starlight can get the rights to perform these standards in the show is 
one of the questions the company is currently pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the show may play Starlight Bowl as early as August, 1991, 
said James Dark, president of the Board of Trustees. If it is not ready for the 
1991 season, Dark said the musical may open the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
This move toward commissioning a new play comes at a time when Starlight is 
finding it harder to come up with musicals new to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't a lot of new musicals out there for Starlight to choose from, Dark 
said. Shows like 'Phantom of the Opera,' 'Cats' and 'Starlight Express' may 
never be released to regional theaters, and recent hits like "Grand Hotel," 
"City of Angels" and "Meet Me in St. Louis" have been reserved for touring 
companies for at least the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Starlight looking at shows that have been around the block a few 
times, like "Cinderella" and "Man of La Mancha." Also under consideration is 
"Babes in Arms," which includes the songs "The Lady is a Tramp" and "My Funny 
Valentine" from the film version of "Pal Joey." 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, Starlight's backward look also comes at a time when 
Starlight is looking at the box office -- nervously. Starlight relies upon its 
box office for 75% of its revenues, and a disappointing turnout for its first 
attempt at Sondheim, the critically acclaimed season opener "Follies," made the 
board of trustees anxious, according to several sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Our subscription base is going down," said Dark. "Starlight has always been 
and will always be a very successful operation. We operate in the black. But 
even a slight dip in subscription base hurts you. We will keep our fingers 
crossed and hope we break even this year." 
</P>
<P>
But why the drop in subscription base? Are people getting tired of the old 
standards or are people turning off at Starlight's recent attempts to try 
something new? Are people turning away from the planes that plague the 
Starlight Bowl or would the company lose its audience altogether if it dared to 
move? -- probably a moot point, since Starlight' lease with the city for the 
Bowl runs for another 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Or is Starlight's audience aging out of the picture? And are the tried-and-true 
musicals failing to bring in younger fans and different audiences. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows. In the meantime, Starlight is trying to please the old audience 
as well as the audience that wants something new by commissioning new shows, 
like the USO show, which will have an old-fashioned feel to them. 
</P>
<P>
Starlight will also continue to look to Musical Theatre Works as an ongoing 
source of new material. 
</P>
<P>
"We will basically be their West Coast branch and we will continue the Prelude 
series every year," said Dark. "Our Board is committed to it." 
</P>
<P>
The next new musical coming into town will come via Lamb's Players Theatre, 
which will present the West Coast premiere of a new Off-Broadway-bound musical 
Oct. 5-Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smyth, the artistic director of the small National City theater troupe, 
said he has had his eye on "Johnny Pye and the Foolkiller" for at least four 
years, since it originated with an Indiana company called the New Harmony 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Mark St. Germain adapted the book from a story by Stephen Vincent Benet 
about a man's 70-year quest to outwit death, also known as "the foolkiller." 
The music and lyrics are by Randy Courts. Deborah Gilmour Smyth, Lamb's 
associate director will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth learned about the musical from one-time Lamb's Players Theatre ensemble 
member David McFadzean, who was instrumental in starting the New Harmony 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Carolyn Copeland produced the show at the George Street Theatre in New 
Jersey and is now planning for an Off-Broadway run. Copeland, a longtime friend 
of Smyth's, gave Lamb's the opportunity to do the West Coast premiere. Lamb's 
will not be involved in the New York run. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Rumors are heating up about stars reportedly going to check out 
the staged reading of the San Diego Repertory Theatre's new musical, "The Life 
and Life of Bumpy Johnson," Sept. 29 and 30 at Newark Symphony Hall in Newark, 
New Jersey. Spike Lee and Bill Cosby are said to be interested in Amiri 
Baraka's script about real-life black gangster Bumpy Johnson. Johnson became a 
hero in his community by using his money to help bankroll the Harlem 
Renaissance. George Ferencz is directing and jazz Hall of Famer Max Roach is 
writing the music. The show will have its world premiere at the Rep in January. 
. . . San Diego Playgoers will present "Les Miserables" and "City of Angels" -- 
along with "Grand Hotel" -- on its fall season schedule. The dates will be 
decided this week, said Stan Seiden, president of the Nederlander organization 
which presents the San Diego Playgoer series. . . . The San Diego Repertory 
Theatre is hoping to remount its successful production of Lanford Wilson's 
"Burn This" beginning Oct. 17 if it can sign the original cast. So far it has 
lined up three out of the four actors. . . . Craig Noel, executive producer of 
the Old Globe Theatre, celebrates his 75th birthday Saturday, but the big 
"Birthday Fantasy" celebration will be mounted as an Old Globe Gala Oct. 13. 
Noel, who won an award from the San Diego Critics Circle for his directing just 
last year, has invested 53 of those 75 years at the Old Globe. . . . Lamb's 
Players Theatre will rent the Lyceum Space Sept. 19-30 to present its artistic 
director, Robert Smyth, in the one-man play, "Damien," about the priest who 
devoted his life to caring for the lepers in a leper colony. Smyth is actively 
looking for a permanent downtown space for his National City company, and will 
explore a less conventional downtown venue when the company brings "Dickens, 
Dining and Song," a production of "A Christmas Carol" along with a very real 
Christmas dinner to St. Paul's Cathedral Dec. 12-23. . . . In the musical 
chairs department: Steve Bevans, Starlight's acting general manager, has 
resigned to become the new managing director for the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre 
Company. Alfred J. Dillon is Starlight's new managing director and Starlight is 
launching a nationwide search for an executive director/chairman of the board.

The revelation that five Notre Dame football players tested positive for 
steroid use was no revelation at all. In fact, the allegation by former Notre 
Dame lineman Steve Huffman that half of the Irish lettermen took steroids isn't 
even the most serious charge contained in the first-person story he co-authored 
for this week's Sports Illustrated.

Steroid use at America's University? The school under the personal watch of 
Touchdown Jesus? Of course. The teenagers who enroll at Notre Dame as freshmen, 
football players or not, are not the little angels propagandists like Lou Holtz 
swear they are. They're normal kids. In the case of football players, they're 
tempted, like players anywhere, to take steroids. Huffman wrote that he knew 
players who were dealing steroids, that players kept up to 50 bottles of pills 
and "injectables" in their rooms. Needles were in the trash cans, he said. If 
that was the case, it doesn't make Notre Dame a terrible place; it means Notre 
Dame is up against the same problems confronting any big-time college football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame officials will deny all this, of course," Huffman said. And of 
course, he was right. They denied widespread steroid use, and said five players 
since 1987 have tested positive. Let's get something straight; just because 
five players test positive doesn't mean only five payers used the stuff. One 
reason the original NFL steroid policy had no teeth was that players had plenty 
of time to train while using steroids in the offseason, then got off them in 
plenty of time to pass a scheduled drug test. Notre Dame has been one of the 
leaders in conducting random, year-round testing. Still, some players had to be 
sophisticated enough to mask usage or evade detection. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to deny Huffman's story or hush it up, Notre Dame officials 
would do well to check out his allegations further. They also would be 
well-served by being a little more sensitive to Huffman's story than Holtz 
allegedly was to injured players. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a coach is not responsible for a guy who makes a conscious decision 
to juice up on steroids. But he is responsible for demonstrating some 
compassion when a kid he has recruited and promised to take care of comes into 
his office and says, "Coach, my shoulder is about to fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman writes about an argument his father had with Holtz back when he was 
coach of Arkansas and Huffman's brother Mike was a Razorback. Mike Huffman says 
Holtz would try to throw injured players out of the athletic dorm, lest they 
"demoralize the other players." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Huffman also says Holtz tried to run him out of South Bend and back to 
school in Texas after he was injured at Notre Dame, and that Holtz called him a 
"coward" for not playing through a shoulder injury that had required surgery. 
Huffman's credibility already has been questioned, partly because current 
players have not rushed forward to substantiate his claims and also because he 
was paid (a reported $5,000) to co-author the piece. Still, on this score, 
Huffman's account rings very true, and it's a story that can be told at 
campuses all across America. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz unconscionably called Huffman "a quitter" in his best-selling book, "The 
Fighting Spirit." Huffman, quite appropriately, pointed out that it is Holtz 
with the history of quitting-head coaching jobs at William and Mary, North 
Carolina State, Minnesota (remember the infamous "escape clause") and don't 
forget the New York Jets, where he lasted through only 13 weeks of a 14-week 
NFL season. Holtz escaped from Minnesota just before the NCAA came to campus to 
investigate alleged violations. Now, that's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman's story wasn't critical of Notre Dame as much as it was critical of 
Holtz, one of the more irritating men in college athletics. Is he a great 
college football coach? Without question. He's rebuilt programs everywhere he's 
been and won a national title. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a world-class whiner. He offended practically anyone with common 
sense, particularly his coaching colleagues, last year by saying over and over 
that his team wasn't any good ("We're not No. 1; we may not even be in the top 
50") despite the fact that Notre Dame was virtually a consensus choice for No. 
1 in the preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
His teams hardly comported themselves as the gentlemen the school would like us 
all to believe they are. Remember the fights in the tunnel at Notre Dame 
stadium against Miami and Southern Cal. Only after three ugly incidents -- 
there also was unsportsmanlike taunting -- did Holtz accept responsibility for 
his team's behavior and publicly insist he would resign if it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is not under indictment here; many schools would be wise to use its 
overall student-athlete philosophy as a model. But if school officials really 
believe there were only five players who took steroids the last three seasons; 
if school officials believe Huffman simply lied to Sports Illustrated about 
Holtz's insensitivity for a fee, then Notre Dame will continue to have a very 
serious problem.

HORSE RACING: CHRIS MCCARRON RETURNS TO RIDE AT DEL MAR A WEEK AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE AFTER A SERIOUS FALL AT HOLLYWOOD PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners were getting antsy, waiting for the star of the show. Chris 
McCarron, just back after recovering from two broken legs and a broken arm, had 
ridden the day's fifth race and was a little late getting to the paddock for 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"Give him a minute," trainer Gary Jones said. "He's probably getting some 
oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron might have thought about taking gas after his comeback at Del Mar on 
Thursday -- he finished fourth and 11th with his two mounts -- but he said he 
was satisfied with his performance and was absolutely giddy about his physical 
condition after nearly three months on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
He was the nation's second-leading jockey when he went down in a grisly spill 
at Hollywood Park on June 3, only two hours before he was scheduled to ride 
Sunday Silence, the 1989 horse of the year, in the Californian Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron's injuries were extensive. When a horse, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, 
broke down in front of McCarron's on the far turn, the jockey was thrown, 
snapping his left thigh on impact. Then he was kicked by a trailing horse, 
breaking his right shin and right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
That night, at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, the 35-year-old 
hall of famer looked down at the wreckage and wondered, "How long this time?" 
</P>
<P>
He had lost five months in late 1986 and early 1987 when a similar fall 
shattered his left thigh at the hip. This appeared every bit as bad. 
</P>
<P>
"How long?" repeated Dr. Dan Capen, who had helped put McCarron back together 
again last time. "Oh, maybe three months." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron was skeptical. But once surgery was completed and Dr. Douglas Garland 
pronounced all procedures successful, McCarron began to believe the prediction. 
Within three weeks, he was swimming. More strenuous therapy soon followed. And 
by mid-July he was beginning to dream the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron even considered starting his comeback in time to ride Sunday Silence 
in the Arlington Challenge Cup in Chicago on Aug. 3, if trainer Charlie 
Whittingham wanted him for the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence injured an ankle and was retired, making a miracle McCarron 
comeback moot. Still, for McCarron to be back in action as soon as Aug. 23 was 
close to amazing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at the latest X-rays, I saw these little lines in the bone where 
the breaks were," McCarron said as he prepared for his first ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Doug, this doesn't look healed to me.' And Doug said, 'Of course it's 
not completely healed. It's only been three months! But you can ride. If I were 
you, I would be riding.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mayberry, who gave McCarron his comeback mount Thursday on the 5-year-old 
sprinter Icy Amber, has known McCarron since he was working as a stable boy on 
the Maryland-Delaware circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done some incredible things," Mayberry said. "But even I was a little 
surprised that he came back so fast from this one. 
</P>
<P>
"However, as soon as I heard he was ready to go, I wanted to be in a position 
to give him his first horse if at all possible," Mayberry said. "He'd never 
ridden Icy Amber before, but I thought this was a race he could win." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, McCarron appeared to be on his way to a Hollywood-style return. 
Icy Amber broke alertly in the six-furlong event, pressed the pace down the 
backstretch, then briefly took the lead inside the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Up in the stands, Scotty McClellan, McCarron's agent, was screaming his head 
off: "Come on, Chris! Come on, buddy! Let him out! Open up on them!" 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Icy Amber tired in the final strides, not his jockey. Icy Amber was 
fourth, about 2 1/2 lengths behind victorious Cutter Sam. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan wasn't really disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to put Chris on horses who have a chance," the agent said. "At 
the same time, I don't want him on a bunch of 2-5 shots. That would be putting 
too much pressure on him while he is getting 100% fit." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron didn't quantify his condition, but as he returned to the jockeys' room 
after riding Native Pocket to an 11th-place finish in the sixth race, he 
admitted to feeling better than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in better shape this time than in 1987," he said as he 
glad-handed his way through the crowd. "The nature of the injury was different. 
I never had any real setbacks with the rehabilitation this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, it will be maybe three or four days before I know I'm 100% fit. How 
will I know? When I can bust a horse out of the gate and ride him hard all the 
way to the wire and then not feel like falling off." 
</P>
<P>
As he entered the walking ring to ride Icy Amber, McCarron was greeted by 
spontaneous applause from fans lining the white rails. McCarron stopped to sign 
a couple of autographs, gave a clenched fist to McClellan standing nearby, and 
approached Mayberry for pre-race instructions. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron knew there would be attention to his return -- "It was like riding in 
a fish bowl" -- but his family and friends kept things purposely low-key. His 
wife, Judy, was watching their oldest daughter Stephanie ride in a show-horse 
competition, for instance. And his parents had returned home from a brief 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no keeping comedian Tim Conway from McCarron's return. A horse 
owner who helps raise money for a special disabled jockeys' fund, Conway 
needled McCarron as he got a leg up from assistant trainer Leandro Mora. 
</P>
<P>
"See if you can stay on this time, huh, jock?" Conway deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Both of McCarron's mounts gave him the opportunity to test his mettle -- and 
metal, because both his right arm and left thigh are healing with the help of 
long stainless steel pins. 
</P>
<P>
"Both horses were getting out (bearing to the right)," McCarron said after his 
second race. Because of that, I was leaning left and putting about 80% of my 
weight on my left leg. It felt just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I also used my stick right-handed once, and there was no problem with that, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron will try to pick up where he left off last June, trying to win the 
richest possible races on any given weekend. He already has two choice 
commitments from trainer Gary Jones: the ride on Classic Fame in the Sept. 2 
Arlington Million, and on Quiet American in the Woodward Stakes, Sept. 15 at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of priorities, however, he may want to win Saturday's ninth race at 
Del Mar as much as any of them. He will be aboard a $25,000 claimer named Saucy 
Sam, which is owned by Dan Capen, the orthopedic surgeon who predicted McCarron 
would be back in three months. 
</P>
<P>
He missed by a week.

DODGERS HANDLE METS, 4-2; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: VALENZUELA, HOWELL COMBINE FOR VICTORY, USING MURRAY'S 20TH HOMER TO 
BEAT CONE. 
</P>

<P>
For 14 years, Eddie Murray has been a model of consistency. For the last 
decade, when the New York Mets came to town, Fernando Valenzuela has been a 
model of, well, consistency. 
</P>
<P>
When the two teamed up Thursday, Murray did what he has done throughout his 
career -- hit a decisive home run -- and Valenzuela did what he has rarely 
done: beat the Mets in Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' 4-2 victory lifted them to within 5 1/2 games of the Cincinnati 
Reds in the West. The loss dropped the Mets four games behind the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela (11-10) engaged David Cone in some role reversal before a Dodger 
Stadium crowd of 44,997. Valenzuela cooled off a team that has been a nemesis 
here, a team against which he had a 2-7 lifetime record entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's fifth-inning two-run home run broke a 2-2 tie and did in one of the 
league's hottest pitchers. Cone, who was 8-2 in his last 13 starts, fell to 9-7 
despite pitching a complete game and striking out nine. 
</P>
<P>
When Valenzuela opened the eighth inning by walking Darryl Strawberry, Jay 
Howell pitched the last two innings to earn his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger pitchers got an assist from an outfield defense that has not been 
considered one of the league's slickest. Kal Daniels made a leaping catch of 
Kevin McReynolds' drive in the fifth inning, going over the left-field wall to 
rob him of a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
And in the eighth, with Strawberry on second, Howard Johnson on first and none 
out, Hubie Brooks made a shoestring grab of Daryl Boston's drive and doubled 
Strawberry off second to snuff the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"That turned out to be one heck of a play," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"We've been playing much better defense. That makes your pitchers look better, 
when you have defense like that." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela opened the second inning by walking Strawberry and Johnson, and both 
scored on singles by Tim Teufel and Alex Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers came back in the bottom of the inning, tying it on run-scoring 
singles by Mike Scioscia and Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets threatened several more times but left the bases loaded in both the 
fourth and fifth innings and finished with only four hits. 
</P>
<P>
With a man on, Murray hit an 0-and-1 fastball barely over the right-field wall, 
his 20th home run. Murray has nine home runs and 34 RBIs since the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
He has hit 20 or more home runs in all but one of his 14 seasons, a fact that 
didn't seem to impress him. Instead, Murray, who has been the Dodgers' top 
hitter in their surge into contention, bemoaned the runners he has left on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got a fastball. It was a little bit up and I was able to get it five 
feet over (the wall), which is enough," Murray said. "It's just good to win a 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was more impressed with Murray's accomplishment. "That's amazing," he 
said. "He's been playing extremely well, and he's made some fantastic plays 
defensively for us." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela said he wasn't aware of his troubles against the Mets. "I never 
check what I do against some teams," he said. "I don't want to 
(psychologically) change anything." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela did change his pitching pattern midway through the game, he said, 
going for the outside corner after working inside in the early innings. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia said Valenzuela "was a little erratic but he made some tremendous 
pitches to get out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't have good stuff," Valenzuela said. "I'm not a power pitcher so I 
have to put the ball in the right spot. But the most important thing is to win 
the game. The team is doing great -- a lot of (close) games we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Neidlinger didn't get a decision in Wednesday's 3-2 victory over 
Philadelphia, but he continues to solidify his position in the rotation. He 
lowered his earned-run average to 2.70 and has a strikeout-to-walk margin of 
26-6 in 33 innings. "He's been as consistent as a pitcher can be," said catcher 
Mike Scioscia. "He has the mark of a late bloomer. We found a diamond in the 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia's run-scoring single Thursday gave him 55 RBIs, a career high. He had 
53 in 1985. . . . Kirk Gibson's third-inning stolen base gave him 18 out of 20, 
the best percentage in the National League. . . . Catcher Rick Dempsey 
continues to play while appealing his one-game suspension for Monday's fight 
with Lenny Dykstra. Dempsey expects to meet with NL President Bill White next 
week when the team in is Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Following an outbreak of injuries, Mets Manager Bud Harrelson has had to juggle 
his lineup to stay in contention with Pittsburgh in the East. Outfielder Mark 
Carreon was lost for the season when he tore a knee ligament in San Diego. He 
will have surgery in Tucson Saturday. It's a similar injury to the one that 
cost Pedro Guerrero most of the 1986 season. . . . Shortstop Kevin Elster is 
also out. Harrelson said he "can live with" Howard Johnson at short, Dave 
Magadan at third and Kelvin Torve at first. "A lot of those moves have been 
made out of necessity," Harrelson said. "Magadan said he can play third every 
day. Howard hasn't hurt us at short." . . . His lineup Thursday included recent 
addition Alex Trevino at catcher, recent callup Darren Reed in the outfield and 
Gregg Jefferies batting leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
Four Bakersfield Dodgers were named to the California League (Class A) all-star 
team -- catcher Bryan Baar, designated hitter Brett Magnusson, left-handed 
pitcher Jason Brosnan and right-handed pitcher Jamie McAndrew. . . . McAndrew, 
son of former Met pitcher Jim McAndrew, has already been promoted to double-A 
San Antonio.

KING DEFENSEMAN LAIDLAW GETS NO RELIEF IN OFF-SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months ago, defenseman Tom Laidlaw of the Kings limped off the Boston 
Garden ice. Minor injury, it was said. Back in a few days, it was predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Days turned into weeks, the season into the off-season, but still the pain, 
centered in his back, persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Another season looms only two weeks ahead, and Laidlaw is still no better. 
He'll be absent when the Kings report to training camp in Hull, Canada, on 
Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Another defenseman, Bob Halkidis, also will miss training camp while he 
continues to recover from shoulder surgery in May. 
</P>
<P>
Halkidis hopes to be back by the start of the regular season; Laidlaw has no 
target date. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to miss a good part of the exhibition games," Laidlaw said, "I 
may miss a good part of the season as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have any answers. When someone breaks a leg, you put a cast on. 
When they take it off, they can rehabilitate it and are ready to play. But this 
is a real guessing game." 
</P>
<P>
The big concern on that St. Patrick's Day in Boston was about Wayne Gretzky, 
who also left the ice limping. When the Kings left Boston, Gretzky's injury was 
diagnosed as a pulled groin. Laidlaw, it was believed, had a hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Laidlaw got home, however, the pain had moved into his back. And a 
minor problem suddenly looked major. 
</P>
<P>
After a summer of therapy and tests, doctors believe Laidlaw may have a tear in 
the protective lining around one of his disks. 
</P>
<P>
If further tests this week show loose lining material floating around, surgery 
to remove that material could be the solution. 
</P>
<P>
For Laidlaw, a 10-year veteran, the thought has occurred that he may never be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"At 32," he said, "time is not on my side. I hope it doesn't come to that, but 
I want to know, one way or the other."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
PIRATES POWER PAST THE REDS AGAIN, 9-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Bonds says if pitchers don't want pitch to Bobby Bonilla, then, "They're 
going to have to pitch to me." If the truth be known, most pitchers would 
rather not pitch to either one and Thursday night was an example why. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla hit a grand slam to cap Pittsburgh's six-run fifth inning and Bonds 
added a two-run homer as the Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds for the fifth 
consecutive time, 9-3, at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Zane Smith (9-7) gave up two runs in 6 1/3 innings to win his third in a row 
since being traded to Pittsburgh on Aug 8. The Pirates have won 10 of their 
last 12, including their first four-game sweep ever in Cincinnati's Riverfront 
Stadium last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Mets) thought we'd get uptight," Bonilla said. "Hey, we're having fun. If 
you don't have fun now, you're going to start having ulcers and getting gray 
hairs." 
</P>
<P>
Don Slaught doubled, tripled and drove in a run as the Pirates improved to 
44-20 against the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla (29 homers, 89 runs batted in) and Bonds (25 homers, 92 RBIs) have 
given the Pirates baseball's most powerful 1-2 combination east of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla has four home runs and nine RBIs in his last five games against 
Cincinnati. His 29 homers are by the most by Pittsburgh player since Jason 
Thompson hit 31 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, Philadelphia 3 -- Ernest Riles tied a club record with his 
fourth pinch home run of the season and reliever Francisco Oliveras pitched 
three scoreless innings for his first NL victory as the Giants defeated the 
Phillies at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who have won three of four games, moved to within 6 1/2 games of 
first-place Cincinnati in the NL West and broke a six-game losing streak 
against the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Riles' three-run homer off reliever Dennis Cook (8-3) came in a four-run, 
fourth-inning rally and gave the Giants a 4-3 lead. He tied the franchise 
record set in 1978 by Mike Ivie and tied by Candy Maldonado in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 8, Atlanta 3 -- Glenn Wilson had four of Houston's season-high 18 hits, 
scored three runs and drove in two to lead the Astros at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Portugal (7-9) scattered seven hits over six innings and won his third 
consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second on consecutive singles by Wilson, Mark 
Davidson and Rafael Ramirez off Charlie Leibrandt (5-8). Franklin Stubbs' RBI 
single and Carl Nichols' sacrifice fly made it 3-0 in the fourth.

Kelly Gruber's grounder scored Mookie Wilson from third base in the bottom of 
the ninth inning Thursday night as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Boston Red 
Sox, 4-3, in the opener of a four-game series at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Blue Jays to within one game of the Eastern 
Division-leading Red Sox. Wilson began the rally with a single to right, his 
third hit of the game, and took third when Joe Hesketh (0-1) threw a pickoff 
attempt down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Fernandez was walked intentionally and Jeff Gray relieved Hesketh. With 
the infield in, Gruber broke his bat on a 1-and-1 pitch and grounded softly to 
third baseman Wade Boggs. But Wilson beat the throw to the plate, sliding in 
ahead of Tony Pena's tag. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Henke (1-2) was the winner for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bolton started for the Red Sox and allowed three runs on six hits in 6 2/3 
innings. He struck out five and walked two. Toronto's Dave Stieb struck out 
four and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, New York 2 -- At New York, Dave Parker drove in four runs to back 
Jaime Navarro's first complete game of the season as the Brewers ended the 
Yankees' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee got 14 hits, including homers by Parker and Rob Deer. Parker singled 
in a run in the first inning and hit a three-run homer off Mike Witt (2-6) in 
the fifth. Deer hit his 25th homer in the fourth and doubled in the Brewers' 
final run in a four-run fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro (4-5), who entered the game with a 5.71 earned-run average, allowed 
eight hits, struck out four and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Seattle 1 -- George Brett and Mike Macfarlane each drove in two 
runs and Kevin Appier won his fifth consecutive decision to lead the Royals at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Appier (10-4) pitched six innings, allowing an unearned run on three hits for 
his eighth win in nine decisions. Steve Farr pitched two innings before Jeff 
Montgomery got the last three outs for his 19th save. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman (11-10) allowed only six hits in eight innings but gave up all 
four runs. He walked two and struck out five. The Mariners have scored 14 runs 
in his 10 defeats and 58 runs in their last 21 games.

American League President Bobby Brown on Thursday upheld the suspensions of 
three Milwaukee Brewers for their part in a June 30 brawl with the Seattle 
Mariners at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher B.J. Surhoff began his three-game suspension Thursday night as the 
Brewers played the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mike Felder will begin his three-game suspension Aug. 27 and third 
baseman Gary Sheffield his three games on Aug. 31. The appeals of all three 
were denied Thursday by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown earlier suspended Manager Tom Trebelhorn for five games, but Trebelhorn 
chose not to appeal and completed his suspension the day after the All-Star 
break. Bob Sebra, now with the Brewers triple-A farm club in Denver, also drew 
a suspension that he will not serve until he returns to the majors. Four 
Mariner also were suspended after the fight that lasted half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers also announced a roster move because of the suspension of Surhoff. 
</P>
<P>
They recalled catcher Tim McIntosh, who was hitting .288 with 18 home runs and 
74 RBIs at Denver. They assigned the contract of left-hander Dennis Powell, who 
is 0-4 with a 6.86 ERA, to Denver.

Eric Dickerson was a no-show at the Indianapolis Colts' training camp in 
Anderson, Ind., once again refusing to report for a scheduled re-examination of 
his injured hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has spent the last two weeks at a Houston clinic where he has been 
undergoing rehabilitation for the non-football injury after failing a team 
physical Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked to return to Indianapolis so that team physicians could evaluate 
his progress. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who was bothered by a hamstring injury in his right leg last season, 
suffered the injury to his left leg while working on his own during the 
off-season. The team therefore considers the injury unrelated to football and 
cannot order Dickerson to report for the physical since he is not being paid by 
the club.

Brian Sochia, starting nose tackle for the Miami Dolphins, was suspended for 
five weeks by the NFL for violating the league's policy on steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real disappointment," Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian knew he was going to be tested when training camp opened." 
</P>
<P>
Sochia's suspension stems from tests on all of the Dolphins at the start of 
camp in mid-July. Shula said there was no indiction the team has a widespread 
problem with steroids or with street drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Sochia, an eighth-year player, will have to sit out the next two weeks and the 
first three weeks of the regular season. If he shows no traces of the substance 
in another test, he will be reinstated for the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Sochia is the fourth player, all linemen, suspended for violating the league's 
policy on steroids. The others are offensive linemen Carl Bax of Tampa Bay, 
John Brandom of Phoenix and Louis Cheek of Dallas.

The biggest battle in Williamsport, Pa., at the Little League World Series 
pitted a dozen groundskeepers against the rain and mud. 
</P>
<P>
The dirty dozen slogged through the mud, rebuilding part of the Lamade Stadium 
infield, covering and then uncovering the infield with a tarp three times. But 
they couldn't beat the elements, forcing postponement of the East-South 
quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
That means the championship game of the World Series won't be played as 
scheduled on Saturday and has been moved to Sunday.

MAJORITY OF RIDERS NO STRANGERS TO COMEBACKS AFTER MAJOR INJURIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Barely half an hour after the dust had settled on Chris McCarron's comeback 
Thursday, Laffit Pincay took a nose-dive at the start of the sixth race. 
</P>
<P>
For maybe 10 seconds, Pincay lay in a ball, an automatic reaction for riders 
whenever they fall. Then, the 43-year-old Hall of Famer got slowly to his feet 
and walked with help to a waiting ambulance. He was OK -- this time. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Pincay and several of his colleagues had talked about the 
perils of their job. Specifically, they were asked to recall comebacks from 
injuries, how they felt mentally and physically when they returned to the 
saddle after a significant layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who broke ribs and suffered internal injuries in a spill here two years 
ago, said that the key to coming back strong was to deal with the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I broke my collarbone, it hurt so bad I was afraid to move," 
Pincay said. "Every little twinge scared me. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that, it took me two months to get back when it should have only 
been about a month. You can't let it bother you." 
</P>
<P>
One never has to look far to find evidence of the dangers of race riding. A 
sweep with a metal detector around the cubicles in the Del Mar jockeys' room 
would red-line the needle. Besides the long pins holding McCarron's left thigh 
and right forearm together, several other riders are toting serious iron. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Meza smashed his right hand in a spill last February at Santa Anita. 
When he learned the extent of the damage, his first words to his doctor were: 
"Will I be able to use it again?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's the worst thing in the world," said Meza, who has only recently picked 
up the momentum lost to his injury. "You wonder just how bad it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
Meza's hand healed, with the help of two screws. He was back in action about 
two months after his spill. But he is far from 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of calcification around the screws and they've shifted," 
said Meza, indicating an obvious bump on the back of his hand between the thumb 
and index finger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tender to touch, and I have to ice it all the time," he added. "I can't 
really use it for much of anything -- except riding. That's the only thing that 
doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Meza said he will have the screws removed the day after the Del Mar meeting 
ends in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, Frank Olivares will undergo minor surgery to have screws taken 
out of his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, 40, suffered the worst injury of his career at the Fairplex Park 
meeting in September 1989 when he went down on the clubhouse turn. His right 
leg was broken below the knee, the ankle was broken in two places and the 
ligaments were badly torn. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see a hole in one of the bones where they tried using a screw but it 
wouldn't take," Olivares said. 
</P>
<P>
"The day I came back it felt great, though," he added. "I was surprised. It was 
like I was never away. But you prepare yourself mentally for that. It's part of 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who has had three major comebacks in the last five years, said 
that the biggest challenge to a comeback was self-control. 
</P>
<P>
"You take for granted that you're ready to go physically," he said. "But the 
adrenaline is flowing pretty good when you ride that first day, and that's 
something you don't really need. You have to be in control out there." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye thought his career could have ended seven years ago at Del 
Mar when he was kicked in the walking ring before a race. He suffered a broken 
hip and extensive muscle damage to the right side of his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried if I was going to be the same rider again," said Delahoussaye, 
who had won consecutive Kentucky Derbies at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, after I convinced myself I could ride, I had to worry if I would be 
accepted. Even when your doing good, if you're away, hurt or whatever, you have 
to prove yourself all over again. Especially here in California. There's plenty 
of talented riders that people will use in a second if they have any doubts in 
you at all." 
</P>
<P>
Darrel McHargue, former national champion and now a racing official, echoed 
Delahoussaye's pragmatic sentiments. McHargue suggested that McCarron needed to 
make a smart, successful return to retain his healthy share of the top mounts 
in rich races. 
</P>
<P>
"Timing is very important," McHargue said. "It's up to McCarron's agent to have 
winning mounts waiting for him now that he's back. He's got to get that 
momentum back right away." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, however, is more important than desire, said Alex Solis, who spoiled 
McCarron's comeback by winning the fifth. Desire to heal quickly and regain a 
winning rhythm, no matter how serious the injury, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no difference how bad you are hurt," Solis said. "It's how strong you 
are right here." 
</P>
<P>
Solis pounded his chest, right over his heart, grabbed his helmet and went out 
to ride the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis won the feature race aboard the 34-1 surprise, Justoneofthegirls, 
for trainer Lewis Cenicola. . . . Gary Jones said that San Diego Handicap 
winner Quiet American will leave for New York Wednesday to run in the Woodward 
Stakes against Criminal Type on Sept. 15.

NO SIGN OF FATIGUE IN FASHION FLARE-UP; 
</P>
<P>
FADS: AS THE MIDEAST CRISIS WEARS ON, MANY SOUTHLANDERS ARE DOING WHAT THE 
TROOPS ARE DOING -- DONNING DESERT COMBAT GEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Attention, fashion slaves. Our military men in Saudi Arabia have inspired a hot 
new trend on the home front: desert combat fatigues for civilians. 
</P>
<P>
But don't rush off to Nordstrom or Rodeo Drive. About the only places you can 
buy desert-patterned battle uniforms (if you're not in the armed forces, of 
course) are in the distinctly sub-haute showrooms of Army-Navy surplus stores. 
</P>
<P>
A check this week of surplus dealers in Southern California revealed that 
sellers have had a hard time keeping desert camouflage togs in stock since the 
U.S. troop buildup began in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become a fad. . . . People sort of feel pride in what's happening, and 
they want to identify with it. It's like raising a flag, almost," said Bernie 
Graf, owner of Surplus Headquarters in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said that in the past several days, he has sold dozens of desert uniforms 
at $55 each. Although he also carries the jacket and pants ensembles in green 
camouflage, his customers have eyes only for the tan-and-chocolate models. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that they are fashion plates probably would elicit more than a few 
guffaws from American soldiers slogging through the superheated silica of the 
Saudi desert. But their jaunty images flickering across millions of TV sets in 
the United States have led many civilian males to conclude that the troopers' 
rumpled, dusty outfits look, well, pretty cool. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the in thing right now," said Peter Kalaydjian, an owner of RECON-1 in 
Tarzana. "It's what's seen on TV, and that's when the wanna-bes come out. We 
have a lot of people who like to dress up as police and security guards, too." 
</P>
<P>
Although some buyers are servicemen who want extra uniforms in case they are 
sent overseas, many are civilians. But the home-front buyers don't think of 
themselves as armchair Beau Gestes. They say they're snapping up the outfits 
out of patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
"If more people would wear something like this, they'd show they're for the 
guys that are over there," said Edward Givant, a Woodland Hills electronics 
technician who shelled out $63 for a desert uniform this week, despite having 
been laid off his job recently. 
</P>
<P>
But Givant also admits his new togs will make him one spiffy-looking patriot. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like the style. It's the real thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion flare-ups, like other offshoots of America's mercurial pop culture, 
often reflect political attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, many young people filled out their wardrobes at Army-Navy 
stores. But then, wearing tattered Army jackets and jungle hats was a way to 
protest an American military engagement -- specifically, the Vietnam War -- not 
to support one. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Millstein, a New York-based fashion analyst, said that if the Persian Gulf 
buildup continues, major clothing retailers may pick up on the trend and offer 
stylized military garb along with other new fashions next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of surplus uniforms, Millstein said, "could have a significant 
impact on the youth market in spring, 1991. . . . The youth market is strongly 
influenced by TV. The current generation, people between 12 and 20, have never 
experienced a war. So to them, this is better than going to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
But a retail-industry observer suggested that wearing desert uniforms may 
suddenly seem very unfashionable if war actually breaks out in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids have Rambo fantasies. But if and when fighting starts, they're 
likely to sober up real quick," said Kurt Barnard, who publishes a newsletter 
from New York that predicts trends in retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf tensions also have helped Army-Navy dealers by driving up sales of 
military-style arm patches, pins, combat knives, T-shirts and even gas masks. 
</P>
<P>
Kalaydjian, of RECON-1, said he recently sold six high-grade, carbon-steel 
combat knives to parents of military personnel who may soon be ordered abroad. 
The knives sell for $220 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Fathers, mothers -- they want the best for whoever's going," he said. "They're 
buying them as going-away gifts, believe it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Surplus sellers said many of those buying gas are worried Iraq may launch a 
chemical attack against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little far-fetched, but you find these kind of people always overreact 
when there's a threat to America," said Randi Shapiro, manager of Santa Ana 
Army and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Tipple, a manager at the Army-Navy Store in Orange, said most of the gas 
masks his store is selling cost just $9 and are designed to withstand only tear 
gas, not lethal nerve gas or other military weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, instructions for the masks, which are made in Israel, are printed in 
Hebrew, making them unreadable to most buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Werner Dreifuss, owner of the Bargain Center in San Diego, said rising 
tensions in the Mideast could eventually hurt him and other surplus dealers. As 
more U.S. soldiers are shipped overseas, he said, his customer base will 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, many surplus sellers are enjoying the onrush of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"When baseball season comes, everybody buys baseball items," said Jack Jehdian, 
a salesman at AGOP Discount in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's military season."

HE TENDS TO BUCK THE TREND

<P>
Richard Tyler is a designer who always dances to the beat of his own drum. 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the fashion world touts casual dressing, Tyler opts for 
elegance. As silhouettes loosen up in other collections, his are form-fitting 
and body enhancing. 
</P>
<P>
It is this anti-Establishment approach to design that has earned the Los 
Angeles-based Tyler a growing reputation as the "West Coast's Jean Paul 
Gautier," the Paris designer known for classic tailoring and eccentric details. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of his fall collection of men's and women's tailored suits, 
sport coats and dresses, shown to a standing-room-only crowd in the designer's 
Beverly Boulevard store last week, will hardly change that perception. 
</P>
<P>
Australian-born Tyler was primarily a menswear designer, who apprenticed with 
Leo Granger, the tailor and outfitter to the late Australian prime minister, 
Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler adapted his British tailored approach to women's wear during his last 
five years in Los Angeles. He added a theatrical division to his company, Tyler 
Trafficante (named for himself and wife/business partner Lisa Trafficante), 
that produces clothing for entertainers like Rod Stewart, Elton John, Janet 
Jackson and Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
For fall ready-to-wear, his preoccupation with Sherlock Holmes' 
Edwardian-inspired tailoring continues as a Tyler trademark reflected in long 
coats with cinched waists and flared hems. Many of his women's designs play off 
classic English equestrian wear -- skintight stirrup pants and hourglass-shaped 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
His three-color satin jackets and red velvet coats for men and women show the 
more severe side of his designs. Likewise, his black gabardine, 
broad-shouldered, peaked lapeled jackets with matching fitted trousers for men 
and coat dresses for women illustrate the designer's more controlled design 
philosophy. Prices range from about $325 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not following any trends with my collection," states Tyler. "All I want 
to project is quality fabrics and well-cut clothing."

GALANOS: CONFIDENT COUTURIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that First Lady Nancy Reagan has returned to civilian life in Southern 
California, Los Angeles designer James Galanos, one of her favorites, has not 
had to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"My name was established before Mrs. Reagan went to the White House," he says 
in his polite and correct manner. 
</P>
<P>
Galanos has been described as a shy man, and he does seem a bit so. But he is 
also a confident man who is not afraid to speak his mind. He walked into Amen 
Wardy, the Beverly Hills shop where he made a personal appearance earlier this 
summer, with a bounce in his step. 
</P>
<P>
Even on this 85-degree day, he is dressed impeccably in a gray wool 
double-breasted suit. The designer is standing in the midst of his latest 
collection -- three long racks of some of the prettiest, most expensive, 
best-made clothes in America. He has the U.S. exclusive on some of the same 
fabrics the French couturiers use. Every bead, ribbon and button has been sewn 
on by hand. Prices range from $6,000 for a daytime dress to $11,000 for an 
elaborate evening gown. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the Los Angeles-based designer has shown his lines in 
New York, not Los Angeles, and done so in July and January, or thereabouts, not 
April and October, along with the other New York designers. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up fashion shows all together about four years ago, replacing them with 
a 12-week whistle-stop nationwide tour he makes twice a year, presenting his 
clothes in specialty stores that carry them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his unusual approach, he has a definite following and knows many of his 
nationwide customers by name. 
</P>
<P>
Galanos' clothes never took on a California look. "You make clothes that have a 
reason for being and travel the world. If you design with one locality in mind, 
you're provincial. We're certainly not that. Half my clothes are never worn in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Galanos' customers include New Yorker Brooke Astor and Angeleno Candy Spelling.

BENEFACTORS SOUND OFF AT WAYNE CANCER CLINIC BENEFIT LUNCHEON

<P>
A charity fashion show featuring chic cocktail dresses and gowns seemed the 
perfect place to find out what cogent comments women have about the current 
state of evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find clothes within a certain price category," one woman said 
emphatically. "You can find them for $300 and $3,000, but that in-between price 
is hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for something that when I walk into a room every one of us doesn't 
have on the same outfit," said another. 
</P>
<P>
The women were surveyed during the John Wayne Cancer Clinic (at UCLA) 
Auxiliary's annual membership luncheon/fashion show/fund-raiser Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
This group of supporters (99% were women) gathered in the ballroom of the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills to view the 1990 Neiman Marcus gown 
collection in a runway show titled "A Little Night Magic," produced by David 
Cardoza. Body-hugging evening wear by Vicky Tiel, Bob Mackie's trademark glitzy 
sequins and Isabelle Allard's slinky black lace gowns were paraded down the 
runway by models in the highest heels and Bardot hair. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the 550 women present spoke plainly about the lack of affordable, 
elegant evening wear needed to maneuver through the upcoming hectic social 
season in style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offended when I go into Chanel and somebody tells me that the jacket's 
$3,000 and the skirt's another $1,600. I'm not going to buy it," said Gretchen 
Wayne, wife of Michael Wayne and a member of the auxiliary's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should be able to dress well and not look like everybody else. We 
need to have better quality in the clothing too, at a price that's within 
reason for the people who are shopping. I'm not shy about spending money at 
all, but I don't want to wear something that looks like a uniform. Otherwise 
I'll go back to wearing my high school uniform." 
</P>
<P>
"Every year the John Wayne Cancer Clinic has a benefactor's event in December, 
and I'll be needing a gown for that, and one for our auxiliary's major 
fund-raiser in April," said Jackie Banchik, president of the auxiliary, who 
wore a white pique suit with gold embroidery. "If I don't start looking now, 
forget it. Because I'm small, it's hard for me to find things." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Lubin and Elaine Lerman, co-chairs of the luncheon, were pinning their 
hopes on New York designer Pamela Dennis, whose cocktail dresses and gowns were 
featured in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We can wear her clothes," said Lubin. "They're great for women in their 50s." 
</P>
<P>
"She has the freshest, most wonderful look of any new designer I've seen," 
added Lerman. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, 30, who came to the show, said she never designs a collection without 
listening to her customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of trunk shows," she said, "and I do listen to these women. I'm not 
just in this to make things that sit on a rack. They tell me they want to look 
classy but sexy at the same time. She really wants her husband to say, 'Wow!' I 
mean, that's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
But not all the talk at the luncheon was about clothes. Celebrity host Jill 
Eikenberry (there with husband Michael Tucker) spoke of her battle with breast 
cancer and stressed the need for support and care of anyone faced with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
So did honorary chairwoman Susan Dobson, who told of her mother's bout with 
pancreatic cancer that doctors told her would take her life in three to six 
months. She then introduced her healthy mother to the crowd to wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Other guests were Michele Lee and Joan Van Ark; Joyce Green, executive director 
of the clinic; and more Wayne clan members, including Michael Wayne, Toni Wayne 
LaCava and Melinda Wayne Munoz. Dr. Donald L. Morton, chief of the cancer 
clinic, was presented with a check for $360,000, representing the money raised 
last year from the auxiliary's events.

MOVIES: 'AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS' OFFERS SOME OF THE LOVELIEST IMAGES EVER 
CONCEIVED BY JAPAN'S GREATEST DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Akira Kurosawa's Dreams" (AMC Century 14 and Beverly Center Cineplex) contains 
some of the most beautiful images ever conceived by the man who is widely 
regarded as the world's greatest living director -- and it also has a couple of 
the most ponderous moments of any of his 28 films. Even so, what works far 
outweighs what doesn't, and this picture is an event for film lovers. Of all 
the films that have played Los Angeles this year, only Theo Angelopoulos's "The 
Travelling Players" can be mentioned in the same breath in regard to level of 
aspiration and intensity of vision. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by actual dreams of the director, Kurosawa's film is composed of eight 
episodes that express his abiding anti-war, anti-nuclear and pro-environment 
sentiments. It is rich in the varied contemplations of a major 80-year-old 
artist looking back and looking ahead with humor and concern. Kurosawa can 
envision a hellish nuclear holocaust as well as a flowery meadow framed by a 
rainbow, a ritualistic dance of life-size dolls performed on a tiered 
mountainside, and one the most idyllic settings imaginable: a cluster of 
watermills by a country stream. And when Kurosawa, whose alter ego (Akira 
Terao) is identified only as "I," literally enters the world of Van Gogh's 
paintings, the audience at the screening this reviewer attended broke into 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, in matters of style and technique, the film is sublime, with 
Kurosawa working with such longtime associates as creative consultant Inoshiro 
Honda (best known as the director of "Godzilla"), cinematographer Takao Saito, 
lighting director Takeji Sano, art director Yoshiro Muraki and composer 
Shinichiro Ikebe. George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic contributed some 
spectacular special effects. The most successful portions of the film are 
marked by a lightness and ease that bring to mind the final films of Luis 
Bunuel. "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams" opens and closes in pure enchantment. The 
first two episodes are the dreams of childhood; the last, completing the 
circle, of serene old age. According to ancient Japanese legend, a fox wedding 
occurs when the sun shines on a rainy day. Such an event occurs in the dream of 
the 5-year-old Kurosawa (Toshihiko Nakano) with consequences that are amusingly 
scary but end in an image of awesome beauty. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, little Akira (Mitsunori Isaki), now several years older, dreams 
that his sisters' hina dolls, arranged in stately rows, have come alive as the 
protesting spirits of the peach trees that Kurosawa's family has cut down in a 
nearby orchard. The elaborate kimonos that the swaying, keening dolls wear have 
been designed by Emi Wada, who won an Oscar for her similarly rich costumes for 
Kurosawa's "Ran." 
</P>
<P>
The light tone of these two dreams gives way to an eerie, ambiguous sequence in 
which a mountain climber, one of four stranded in a snowstorm, is comforted by 
a beautiful spirit -- but is she an angel of mercy or of death? In any event, 
she is a sensual, seductive creature, alternately a figure of comfort and 
menace and finally as ethereal as a scarf carried away by a gust of wind. The 
film's tone grows much darker in a sequence so imaginative, so stunning in 
effect, that it cannot be given away. It suffices to say that it has to do with 
a heart-breaking incident of the supernatural experienced by a weary young 
soldier who passes through a tunnel on his way home from a World War II 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
If only Kurosawa had been as inspired in remembering the tragedy of war when 
warning us of nuclear peril. He creates a horrifying image of Mt. Fuji melting 
in the wake of a nuclear accident, featuring some 2,000 extras, and focusing on 
several principals who curse their fates in a didactic manner. The image is so 
powerful the words aren't really necessary. But Kurosawa compounds the 
heavy-handedness of his message, first expressed 35 years ago in his feature "I 
Live in Fear," by following this nightmare with yet another. In this sequence, 
his alter ego survives to meet a band of mutants, all of whom had been 
government officials or financiers responsible for the nuclear folly. Kurosawa 
might have gotten away with the first sequence, but the two side by side are 
really heavy going. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, these two sequences are preceded by his glorious homage to Van Gogh 
and are followed by the warm and charming finale. In the first, Kurosawa's 
alter ego enters the world of Van Gogh through one of his most famous 
paintings, the 1888 "Drawbridge at Arles." Kurosawa plays with levels of 
reality by making the actual world of Arles look like a series of Van Gogh 
paintings and by having his alter ego scamper over the characteristic deep 
ridges of the artist's paintings made so large as to make the Kurosawa figure 
seem like the Incredible Shrinking Man in his final stages of diminution. 
</P>
<P>
In the casting of Van Gogh, Kurosawa has made a truly daring choice: director 
Martin Scorsese, who in Bertrand Tavernier's " 'Round Midnight" proved that 
great actors great directors don't necessarily make. But Scorsese -- the entire 
sequence is in English in deference to him -- is surprisingly effective, 
especially in the dark intensity of his gaze. 
</P>
<P>
For his final dream Kurosawa has cast an enduring icon of the Japanese cinema, 
Chishu Ryu, as a 103-year-old man -- Ryu is actually a mere 86 -- who tends the 
watermills in his beautiful village and tells his visitor of the importance of 
living close to nature and the acceptance of the inevitability of death, which 
should be a matter of celebration when the life has been lived long and well. 
This is a warm coda of reconciliation, but it should not be taken as as a 
farewell to the screen on the part of the director. For as "Akira Kurosawa's 
Dreams" (rated PG; some scenes too intense for the very young) opens its run, 
the master enters his ninth decade already shooting his next picture.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: GET RENTALS EARLY FOR LABOR DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get ready for long lines and empty shelves at your local video store. Labor Day 
weekend, one of the biggest rental periods of the year, is just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The public doesn't often think of Labor Day as a big rental weekend, but it's 
up there -- though not quite as big -- with the four-day Thanksgiving weekend 
and New Year's Eve," said Ron Castell, senior VP of the Blockbuster chain. 
"After a day or two, the shelves are picked clean. That's the way it has been 
every Labor Day weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Why the big rental crunch then? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last big weekend of summer," said Lou Berg, who heads Houston's 
Audio-Video Plus chain. "It symbolizes the end of summer fun. Parents and kids 
both figure they'll be busy for the next few weeks, so they rent movies for the 
last leisurely weekend of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
This Labor Day weekend, some retailers predict, should be bigger than most. 
"With gas costing more, people won't be traveling as much, so they'll be 
renting more that weekend," said Brad Burnside, who beefs up the staff of his 
Evanston, Ill., Video Adventure stores to handle the extra business. "People 
are more likely to stay home and watch. Also, George Bush is on TV a lot with 
depressing news about the Middle East. That makes people want to escape. 
They'll turn off the TV and rent a video. During times like this video rentals 
are way up." 
</P>
<P>
Because of weather, it's a bigger rental weekend in some regions than others. 
"If weather is very good, it cuts into Labor Day weekend business," said Peter 
Margo, executive vice president of the Palmer Video chain. "In bad weather we 
do 30% better business." 
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of greater rental traffic, video companies often put out more 
releases than usual, realizing that retailers will be hungry for new titles. 
New rental releases set for the middle of next week include: "Bad Influence," 
"Stella," "Where the Heart Is," "Lord of the Flies," "Mountains of the Moon," 
"Madhouse" and "Rosalie Goes Shopping." The biggest title, though, is aimed at 
the sales market -- MGM/UA's "All Dogs Go to Heaven," which will sell for 
$24.98. 
</P>
<P>
There is generally a drastic drop-off in video rentals after Labor Day, with 
fewer releases the first weeks of September -- and almost never any blockbuster 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
"In September, there are too many distractions, too many things for people to 
do other than watch rental movies," explained Tower Video's product manager 
John Thrasher. "Kids and parents are busy adjusting to the new school year. 
There's the start of the new TV season. There's the beginning of football and 
the excitement of the end of the baseball season. By the end of the month, 
people have settled into new patterns so they have more time to watch rental 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
All the retailers said that smart renters get their movies for the weekend by 
Thursday or early Friday. By Saturday, you may be out of luck.

ON A ROLL: The impertinent skateboarder who steals the ball from Dominique 
Wilkins in the current Reebok TV commercial is 12-year-old Jesse Roach of 
Laguna Beach. . . . It's the second TV spot for the skateboard whiz. The first, 
for Levi's jeans, was "dumb," but this one was fun, Jesse says. . . . 
Regardless, both were "gifts from God," says Jesse's mom, Joan Roach. "They 
paid for his college." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

FOR SALE? Every day the federal government's Resolution Trust Corp. hangs onto 
Irvine-based Lincoln S&amp;L, it loses money. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 3 months of this year, it lost $133 million. Now that a federal 
court has cleared the way for government to dispose of Lincoln (D1), what is 
the likelihood of finding a buyer to take over the thrift? "About nil," says 
Brea-based S&amp;L analyst Gerry Findley. "There is more prospect of them 
dismantling it and selling off pieces." The feds won't speculate. Mark I.

ABE LINCOLN TO STAY; KERMIT HOPS AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
DISNEYLAND: THE 'GREAT EMANCIPATOR' DISPLAY WAS TO BE REPLACED BY THE HEAD 
MUPPET UNTIL THE FROG WAS GIGGED BY TOURISTS' PROTESTS.

<P>
Abraham Lincoln has apparently been emancipated from a future on a storage 
shelf by tourists at Disneyland who rebelled over the prospect of Kermit the 
Frog replacing him at a park exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials have shelved their plans to close the 25-year-old "Great Moments 
With Mr. Lincoln" show on Disneyland's Main Street this weekend, they said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland operators said visitors and park employees alike reacted angrily to 
reports that the robot replica of the nation's 16th President was being removed 
to make room for a new Muppets attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Put the Muppets in there? No! No!" said Leona Banks of Kankakee, Ill., 
standing outside the Main Street opera hall where a mechanical Lincoln robot 
rises from an antique chair to deliver a five-minute speech 51 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibit carries a message to the people of the United States. It's 
something very emotional -- and I'm not just saying this because I'm from the 
'Land of Lincoln,' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
Grumbled 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand Forks, Minn.: "Lincoln was 
President. Kermit is a frog." 
</P>
<P>
Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters last year. The 
company disclosed in January that it would begin staging parades and live shows 
in 1991 featuring the puppets developed by the late Jim Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Dick Tracy-themed attractions and new Hollywood-oriented shows 
scheduled to open through 1999, the Muppets are part of an expansion program 
that park officials have dubbed "The Disney Decade." 
</P>
<P>
Reports have circulated for the last three months among Disneyland's 8,000 
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which also houses exhibits honoring 
park founder Walt Disney, would be turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced a week ago that the Lincoln exhibit would be closed Sunday 
for "refurbishing" the opera house. They said plans for the plush-seated 
auditorium near the park's entrance would be disclosed later. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, park operators said Lincoln will live -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Paul Goldman said that park planners are looking at 
several other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the "It's a Small 
World" attraction. "It's a matter of shoehorning things in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said officials were surprised by the outcry over Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd asked a few days ago, I'd have said that being a 25-year-old 
attraction, its popularity has passed. But there seems to be a lot of sentiment 
for Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures, they 
acknowledge that park visitors haven't shown a lot of interest in the Lincoln 
show. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, only a handful of park visitors filed into the 500-seat theater 
to watch the 13-minute production. The show starts with photographic slides and 
ends with a full-sized replica of Lincoln standing at the U.S. Capitol and 
gesturing as it speaks of liberty and patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
The electronically animated figure blinks its eyes, wiggles its fingers and 
nods and turns. The robot was rewired about five years ago to add sophisticated 
new movements as part of a $200,000 renovation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's short speech actually consists of excerpts from five addresses 
delivered by the Great Emancipator between 1838 and 1864. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope they aren't going to do away with this," said tourist John 
Folliard of Oregon City, Ore. "The rides are nice, but I'm real patriotic." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim teacher Nola Vroom escorted 60 children from a summer church camp to 
"Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln" after hearing that the display was slated for 
closure this weekend. She said she wanted to make sure they had a chance to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Kermit because I'm a first-grade teacher. But I like Lincoln, too," she 
said, glancing around the nearly deserted entrance to the theater. "If more 
people knew this was going to close, they'd be lined up to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland employee Sandy Spurgeon, who has seen the Lincoln show "thousands of 
times" during the 10 years she has worked as a show hostess, said the Muppets 
should go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they fit in on Main Street," Spurgeon said. "I've had people 
come here in tears about this." 
</P>
<P>
Across the park, Monorail ride operator Julio Escobedo agreed that the 
Disneyland entrance should keep its nostalgic, turn-of-the-century Americana 
look. "Take out the submarine ride and put the Muppets there," he said.

DIANNE KLEIN: THE BATTLE FOR BABY TIMMY; 
</P>
<P>
AN 'OPEN ADOPTION' SHUTS COUPLE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There was somebody at the door, insistent, obviously with a purpose. The 
pounding startled Bob Stiglitz awake Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He'd been napping, stealing an hour or so while Timmy slept in his crib and his 
other son, 4-year-old Sean, was playing in another room. Bob's wife, Marci, had 
run to the store to pick up some milk. 
</P>
<P>
So it took Bob a few minutes to figure out what was going on. When he came down 
the stairs and squinted through the peephole in the front door, he didn't 
recognize the man he saw. Then the man called to somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
"Alyssa," the man said, and then Bob Stiglitz knew. 
</P>
<P>
They were here to take Timmy away. Right now. On the orders of the law. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't according to plan. None of it. In this tale of an adoption gone 
awry, it seems that everyone has been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa, 17, gave birth to Timmy 15 months ago at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
The state, after declaring Alyssa destitute when she moved out of her parents' 
Coronado Island home, paid her medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa's pregnancy, it seems, had sparked too many fights at home. She'd been 
in the ninth grade. Timmy's father, blond and blue-eyed like his son, is a boy 
that Alyssa hardly knows. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa's contact with the Stiglitzs, who live in Huntington Beach, came through 
A Center for Adoption, Youth and Family Counseling in San Diego. Timmy's 
natural father had offered his consent to give the child away. 
</P>
<P>
What Alyssa said she liked about the center and the Stiglitzs was their 
enthusiasm for arranging an "open adoption," a relatively new concept that 
embraces birth parents as part of an extended family. The Stiglitzs have such 
an arrangement with Sean's natural mother, and it has worked well. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years of infertility treatments, including a failed attempt at in-vitro 
fertilization, had convinced Bob and Marci -- he is 47 and she 39 -- that 
adoption was the best way to make their family grow. 
</P>
<P>
And Alyssa herself is an adopted child. The Stiglitzs and, seemingly, Alyssa 
felt that all of them would make a good match. She chose them to adopt her 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt almost inherently that we had some common ground," says Bob, who works 
in the maintenance department of the Fountain Valley School District. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought what we were doing was in everybody's best interest," adds Marci, a 
special-education teacher for the same school district. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, of course, was before -- about two years ago. Emotionally, 
however, it seems almost light years away. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, most of the communication between Alyssa and the Stiglitzs has been 
through the courts. Wednesday afternoon was simply the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
It started, Marci and Bob now believe, when Alyssa failed to live up to the 
"open adoption" visiting agreement: The first time she saw Timmy outside the 
hospital was when he was 5 months old. The Stiglitzs saw that as a sign that 
she did not care. 
</P>
<P>
When she did visit for the first time, with her mother, Bob recorded the 
occasion on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"Timmy cried for about half an hour, 45 minutes," Bob says. "He was really 
upset. . . . But I turned off the tape during that time, because I remember 
thinking I didn't want to have anything messy for us to look back on." 
</P>
<P>
Before Alyssa and her mother left, they talked about plans for a Christmas 
visit. The Stiglitzs say they had no clue that anything was wrong. Then, a few 
days later, their lawyer told them that Alyssa wanted Timmy back. 
</P>
<P>
The Stiglitzs say that they were flabbergasted and that they tried, without any 
luck, to get Alyssa to talk about her decision face to face. 
</P>
<P>
When they next met, in Superior Court, the Stiglitzs won the first round. But 
earlier this month, the 4th District Court of Appeal sided with Alyssa and 
ruled that she deserved her baby back. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that when she refused to consent to the adoption when the child 
was 5 1/2 months old, she was within her legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
Two court-appointed attorneys for Timmy, who had argued that the child's best 
interests were not being taken into account, were likewise overruled. 
</P>
<P>
"There is simply no discretion to consider whether the child has bonded to the 
prospective adoptive family or who will provide a better home," the appellate 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the court went on, "we do not wish to see another case of this 
nature." The case of Robert S. et al. vs. Alyssa W. was the third in two months 
in which the appeals court in Santa Ana had overturned an independent adoption 
and ordered a toddler returned to its birth mother. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, moreover, the state Supreme Court refused to review the Stiglitzs' 
plea to keep Timmy with the only family that he has known. 
</P>
<P>
When I talked to the Stiglitzs in the kitchen of their home, it had been less 
than two hours since Timmy had been spirited out of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
When Marci tells me that she wasn't even there to kiss him goodby, tears cloud 
her already reddened eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The Stiglitzs had arranged for Alyssa and her parents, with whom she now lives, 
to pick up Timmy at 6 p.m. Instead, Timmy was rousted from his nap, up and out, 
in less than five minutes. The man with Alyssa was her older brother. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Alyssa that I would go get Timmy," Bob says. "She said no. She said, 'I 
don't want you to ever touch him again.' . . . All of this caught me off guard. 
It happened quite a bit differently than we would have liked. . . . I don't 
know, maybe it was kinder. I don't know that there was any honor in it, as 
angry as I was, but maybe it was kinder than a long, protracted scene." 
</P>
<P>
So, Bob Stiglitz says, he followed Alyssa, her brother and Timmy out his front 
door. He pointed out some bags he had packed with Timmy's things. The toddler 
was still asleep. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were outside, however, Alyssa and her brother began to run toward 
their car. Timmy awoke, Bob says, and began to scream. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I feel that they are victims too," Bob says, "whether they had bad 
counseling or whatever. We are angry that this happened. We were advised that 
we were within our rights. They were advised that they were within their 
rights. . . . There should be a better way." 
</P>
<P>
The couple estimates they have spent more than $55,000 so far on legal fees, 
other related incidentals and -- under their agreement with the center -- 
counseling for Alyssa and her mother. They were forced to take out a second 
mortgage on their house. All of this, they believe, has been for naught. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa, presumably back in San Diego, did not return my telephone call, but her 
court-appointed appellate attorney, Donna Groman of Los Angeles, says, "This 
was a bad adoption in the first place. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Stiglitzs had bad legal advice. There were all sorts of red flags. 
. . . Alyssa wasn't ready to give the child up. . . . And her inability to make 
a well-reasoned decision was just another red flag. There should have been 
better screening. The Stiglitzs should have given the child up at 6 months, 
before any more bonding occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Now, say the Stiglitzs, it is time to get on with the rest of their lives, to 
pay more attention to their other son, who still doesn't understand what 
happened to the towheaded toddler that he loves. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Stiglitzs are meeting with other adoptive parents to see 
if some sort of changes can't be made in the laws. They feel that priorities 
are out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
And Bob Stiglitz, in particular, is angry with the treatment the couple 
received from the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent being called a criminal and an outlaw by a learned judge," he says. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Marci Stiglitz offers a wan smile, and tears again begin clouding 
her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope this doesn't happen to any more couples," she says, "what 
happened to us."

<P>
RALLY PROTESTS POLICE SWEEPS OF HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of protesters rallied Thursday outside Santa Ana City Hall to 
complain about the Police Department's roundup of the homeless at the Civic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs that read, "Compassion not harassment," about a dozen people 
from the Catholic Worker organization demonstrated on behalf of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But many passers-by said they support the police sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
"They're bums," one man said of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"What disturbs me the most is that there's a lashing out against the homeless," 
said Jonathan Parfrey, who organized the protest. "It's not posh or chic 
anymore to help the homeless. So people think it's OK to harass them." 
</P>
<P>
In the past 2 weeks, police have conducted two sweeps at the Civic Center, 
arresting more than 90 people, most of them for municipal code infractions such 
as public drunkenness, littering and urinating in public. Seven people were 
arrested on outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless rights advocates have criticized the sweeps, saying they are police 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
During an Aug. 15 sweep, police arrested 64 people and took them to Santa Ana 
Stadium, where officers marked their arms with booking numbers and chained them 
to benches for 6 hours. The arrestees were then cited with misdemeanors and 
released. More than 30 of those arrested have sought help from Orange County's 
Legal Aid Society, which is organizing a task force to defend them in court. 
Legal Aid officials say they will try to seek a temporary restraining order to 
stop the roundups. 
</P>
<P>
Parfrey said Santa Ana officials were not offering alternatives to the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"'I'm sympathetic with people who go to work here and, yes, maybe it smells 
here because of the homeless," Parfrey said. "But is the solution really to 
drive them out with harassment?" 
</P>
<P>
Many who work at the Civic Center, such as attorney Randall Bisson, said they 
support the police action. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions at the Civic Center have gotten worse and worse," Bisson said. 
"For people who have to work here every day, it's hard to put up with people 
who use the parking lots as restrooms." LILY ENG

AIRPORT CONTRACTOR MISSES A DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled John Wayne Airport contractor Taylor Woodrow Construction California 
Ltd. missed Thursday's promised deadline for completing the new Thomas F. Riley 
Terminal, with just three weeks remaining before scheduled airline use. 
</P>
<P>
Pesky software glitches in the computer-controlled fire-suppression system 
caused it to fail for the fourth time in as many weeks, making the $62-million 
terminal ineligible for a required temporary certificate of occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite objections from Taylor Woodrow, airport officials have refused to 
accept the building as substantially complete until the fire-control system 
works. The rest of the terminal is complete, except for some minor cleanup 
work, "tweaking" of the air conditioning and airline equipment installation, 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned, but we think the problem is going to be solved in enough 
time," said airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier said the fire-control system is not 
the only item Taylor Woodrow must fix before the county will accept the 
building, but she said the others are "very minor" and will be done in the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, for whom the new terminal is named, said Taylor 
Woodrow's failure to meet Thursday's deadline "is a surprise, and I hate 
surprises." 
</P>
<P>
"I will take whatever action is necessary," Riley said, " . . . to have all of 
the activities stay on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Riley was referring to a Sept. 4 media luncheon, black-tie reception Sept. 7, 
public open house Sept. 8 and the terminal's first use by aircraft Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Senior Vice President William L. Ostfeld defended the company's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Since last December, we've worked toward a substantial completion date of Aug. 
23," he said. "We have been testing the complex life safety and operational 
systems for the past four weeks in the terminal. This week the fire marshal has 
requested some minor modifications and we are making them. The building itself 
has been substantially complete since Aug. 10." 
</P>
<P>
The new, 337,900-square-foot domed terminal has been plagued by delays and cost 
overruns since construction began in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After steadfastly denying that the terminal would miss its April 1, 1990, 
opening, airport officials last December announced a postponement until Sept. 
16. At the same time, Taylor Woodrow's Feb. 28, 1990, completion deadline was 
extended to May 16 due to late steel deliveries. That contractual deadline has 
never been changed and is the date from which late fines totaling $25,000 a day 
will be assessed against Taylor Woodrow, pending further negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
In May, county supervisors fired Taylor Woodrow from a $25-million garage and 
elevated roadway contract for lateness, but also to pressure the firm into 
finishing the terminal building quickly. Taylor Woodrow sued the county over 
that contract loss. Also, the county forced the Irvine-based contractor to 
adhere to a rigid set of conditions, and promised final delivery of the 
terminal to the county by Thursday.

UNION CONTRACTS DELAY CITY BUDGET

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite two months of study and debate, the City Council is still wrangling 
over the city's $218-million budget because contracts with the police and fire 
unions have not been settled. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana is the largest city in the county without a final 1990-91 budget at 
hand. The council missed its own deadline last month for passing the budget. 
The city councils of Irvine and Westminster have not passed final budgets 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being held hostage by the contracts," said Mayor Daniel H. Young, who is 
pushing for budget passage. Young described the delays as "embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilman Richards L. Norton contends that the council should not 
pass the budget until contracts are settled. He said the city might be forced 
to change budget appropriations after the contracts are approved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to pass it now," Norton said. "We will be taking from Peter to 
give to Paul." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's budget, which emphasizes a beefed-up police force to battle gang 
activity, was unveiled by City Manager David N. Ream in May, but final adoption 
has been postponed six times throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ream said on Wednesday that further budget delays could begin to affect 
personnel expenditures, such as the amount of overtime paid on a monthly basis 
and service contracts. The city has also had to delay many public works 
construction projects and all capital improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
Until the new budget is passed, the city will not be able to add the 15 new 
positions budgeted for the Police Department, Ream said. Those positions 
include six additional investigators for the department's narcotics unit and 
four more investigators for its gang unit. In addition, five more non-sworn 
officers will be added to the force to allow officers more time to patrol the 
streets. The 10 new investigators will be chosen from within the department's 
roster of 351 officers. The budget also allocates $219,055 for the promotion of 
three sergeants to the position of lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's $40-million budget represents approximately 40% of the 
city's general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
Also delayed is additional funding for Project Pride, a program run by the 
Recreation and Community Services Agency, Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for this program, which attempts to steer youngsters away from joining 
gangs, has been nearly doubled from $66,000 to $110,000 to make it available at 
six additional schools. 
</P>
<P>
A total of $34.8 million has been budgeted for the delayed capital 
improvements. In addition to the work being done in neighborhoods, there will 
be resurfacing of major thoroughfares, new traffic signals, parks improvements 
and a library renovation and expansion program. LILY ENG and GREG HERNANDEZ

CANDIDATE TAKES FUND-RAISING LEAD

<P>
City Council candidate Charles Hicks has gotten a jump on his opponents in the 
November race, at least when it comes to fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, who announced his intention to run last year, has raised more than 
$2,500, according to campaign disclosure forms. He was the only candidate to 
file the forms. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important" to get organized early, Hicks said. He already has held two 
fund-raisers and is considering another in October, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks' major contributors include Warland Investment of Santa Monica, which 
gave $1,000, and Cypress Homes of Newport Beach, which gave $250. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other candidates, including John Standiford and Joyce Nicholson, 
are still organizing their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson is known for her work with Concerned Citizens of Cypress, the group 
instrumental in shaping the development of the Los Alamitos Race Course, but 
she said she is not going to depend on name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't rely on name identification," said Nicholson, a real estate agent. 
"When I decided to do this, I decided to go all out." She is planning a 
fund-raiser for the end of next month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Standiford said he plans to take a less formal approach. "I am trying to raise 
money on a more informal basis, hopefully without an event." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Cecilia L. Age, who set an all-time fund-raising record in 1988, said it 
is no surprise that most of the candidates are less aggressive about fund 
raising this year. "I don't foresee anyone putting up that kind of money," said 
Age, referring to her $25,000 campaign fund. "Most of the main issues have been 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Walter Bowman said he has no plans to run an all-out campaign and 
instead will rely on friends and support he has gained in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Richard Partin and Judith Pineda also said they will be running a 
low-key race. Partin said he will knock on doors, put out posters and then wait 
to "see if I can't win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pineda: "I have 10 grandkids, and they all want to do signs. We are going 
to put them out." LYNDA NATALI

MOLA FILES CLAIM FOR LOSSES OF $11 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mola Development Corp. has filed a claim against the city seeking $11 million 
for losses related to its four-year battle to build a $200-million housing 
development that the city first approved, then rejected. 
</P>
<P>
A claim must be filed before the developer can sue the city. Mola attorney 
Jeffrey M. Oderman said the company plans to sue Seal Beach if the City Council 
rejects the claim. 
</P>
<P>
The city's original approval of the 335-unit Hellman Ranch project last October 
was thrown out by an Orange County Superior Court commissioner in March because 
Seal Beach's housing plan had not been updated in compliance with state law 
when the approval was given. Three months after the commissioner's action, a 
new City Council voted to reject the project. 
</P>
<P>
Mola's claim, which names the City Council and three of its members, says the 
city never informed the developer that the housing plan was out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, however, said Mola "was fully aware that the 
housing element (of the city's General Plan) was outdated" and should not try 
to blame the city for the loss of its project. 
</P>
<P>
The claim also alleges that the city treated the company unfairly during its 
evaluation of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"They have singled Mola out for requirements that have never been imposed on 
any other development in the city of Seal Beach and, to my knowledge, have 
never been imposed on any development in coastal Orange County or Los Angeles 
County," Oderman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the "arbitrary and unreasonable" requirements cited by Mola were 
those aimed at dealing with potential hazards of building on a site straddling 
an earthquake fault. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Forsythe, Marilyn Bruce Hastings and Frank Laszlo cited such 
concerns when they voted in June to reject the project. 
</P>
<P>
Mola named them in the claim because "they are the three individuals who were 
responsible for putting Mola in the position it's in," Oderman said. "They are 
the ones who made the decision to turn this project down without regard to the 
existing rules and evidence." 
</P>
<P>
He said the new council, seated in May, reversed the old council's conclusions 
about the safety of the site even though land conditions and project 
specifications were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will vote Sept. 10 on whether to deny or accept Mola's claim, 
City Manager Robert Nelson said. Only after the city formally rejects its claim 
can Mola file a lawsuit seeking compensation for the $11 million the company 
claims to have spent since 1986 to secure rights to the land and pay other 
pre-development costs, Oderman said. He added that the developer will also sue 
for additional damages. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the claim "is not a surprise. They've been saying over and over 
again that if the city rejected (the project) they'll sue." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this claim has merit," Nelson said. "I expect that (city staff) 
will recommend it be denied." 
</P>
<P>
The $11 million in losses claimed by Mola is two-thirds as big a sum as the 
city's entire 1990-91 budget, which is $16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Oderman said the claim does not mean Mola will abandon plans for the Hellman 
Ranch project. Company officials are still hoping the state's 4th District 
Court of Appeal in Santa Ana will reinstate the original approval given to the 
project last October, Oderman said. CHRISTOPHER ADAMS

ROBBERY SUSPECTED IN CABIN SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbery is suspected as the prime motive in the slaying of a Newport Beach 
woman who was shot to death at a secluded mountain resort her family owns on 
the edge of Sequoia National Forest, Tulare County sheriff's deputies reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators released a composite sketch and description of the suspect after 
interviewing the survivor of the attack, which occurred about 3:20 a.m. Sunday 
inside a log cabin at Camp Nelson Lodge in the southern Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie J. Hood, 46, was shot once in the head with a pistol inside her quarters 
at the resort. Rudy Manuel, 35, the lodge's caretaker, was also wounded in the 
head, but managed to contact a telephone operator. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel, who is expected to recover, was listed in stable condition Thursday at 
Valley Medical Center in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies described the assailant as a stocky Caucasian male, 30 to 35 years 
old, about 5 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 8 inches tall, and weighing 200 pounds. 
He has curly blond hair down to the collar and a thin mustache. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Zapalac said robbery appeared to be the main motive, although a team 
of detectives has not been able to determine if anything was stolen from the 
lodge. He downplayed reports that disputes between some Camp Nelson residents 
and Hood had anything to do with the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the lodge and members of the Hood family have said that some 
residents opposed plans to expand the resort, while some of the lodge's more 
rowdy patrons were unhappy recently about being thrown out of the restaurant 
and bar. 
</P>
<P>
Hood's son, James Jr., also said that several weeks ago a threatening note was 
fastened to the windshield of his mother's car. 
</P>
<P>
Zapalac said there was no indication that Hood or Manuel knew their attacker or 
had seen him before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Hood and her 47-year-old husband, James N. Hood, a real estate salesman, bought 
the 43-acre resort in 1987 and reopened the lodge after it had been closed for 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Its rustic restaurant and bar soon became a popular hangout for locals from 
Camp Nelson, a small mountain community of less than 200 permanent residents 34 
miles east of Porterville. 
</P>
<P>
Hood and her family had been refurbishing the grounds, which included a stone 
and timber lodge built in 1926, a store built in 1903, a 10-room motel 
constructed in 1961 and a dozen log cabins from the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with any information about the suspect is encouraged to call the Tulare 
County Sheriff's Department at (209) 733-6218. Ask for Sgt. Zapalac or Det.

BREAST CANCER TEST SURVEYOR 'ENCOURAGED'; 
</P>
<P>
MAMMOGRAMS: RESEARCHER, HOWEVER, LISTS SOME OLDER WOMEN, ASIANS AND THE 
LESS-EDUCATED AS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE TEST. 
</P>

<P>
Despite increased publicity about the importance of routine mammograms for 
early detection of breast cancer, 20% of Orange County women over 40 have never 
had one, according to a poll released Wednesday by UC Irvine researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Older women, Asian women and less-educated women were least likely to have 
mammograms in Orange County, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
And the primary reason they cited for never seeking the brief, non-invasive 
exam that can find cancer at a curable stage? 
</P>
<P>
"They just never thought of it," said Dr. Hoda Anton-Culver, the UCI 
epidemiologist who sampled a total of 962 women last October and this April for 
the Orange County Health Research Surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Of women who never had had a mammogram, 33% said the idea of the test hadn't 
crossed their minds. Another 26% said they "thought it was not necessary"; 14% 
said "their doctor never recommended it"; 9% just procrastinated and 1% were 
worried about radiation, Anton-Culver said. She noted that the possibility of 
getting excess radiation from mammography was a legitimate concern some years 
ago but is not now a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Health Research Surveys -- a 2-year-old project funded by the 
Irvine Health Foundation -- has been studying the incidence of medical problems 
here as well as local attitudes toward health care. Additional 1990 survey 
results, including how Orange County residents were affected by this summer's 
controversial malathion spraying, are to be released Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Anton-Culver, who also serves as president of the American Cancer Society's 
Orange County chapter, said that overall she was "very encouraged by the high 
percentage of women, especially those over 40, who have had at least one 
mammogram." Her survey showed that 69% of respondents over age 40 have been 
tested at least once. 
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the risk for breast cancer goes up after age 40. The American 
Cancer Society and the National Institute of Cancer recommend that women should 
have a mammogram at least once a year after the age of 50 -- and some doctors 
believe that women should be tested after the age of 35 so that cancer can be 
detected early and treated effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Anton-Culver also said that she was especially pleased that a high percentage 
of both Anglo and Latino women -- 55.2% and 53.2% respectively -- reported 
having a mammogram. 
</P>
<P>
The epidemiologist said she was pleased that Latinas are getting mammograms for 
health-care prevention, but "I am discouraged that we are not reaching the same 
. . . proportion of Asians. And I am discouraged that women in general, 
especially those over 40, are not going to mammography in a routine fashion. 
The rate of cancer (in Orange County) looks to me higher than what it should 
be." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that 37.5% of the 1,200 breast cancer cases diagnosed each year in 
Orange County are caught "at a late stage," when treatment is less likely to be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that only 28.9% of Asians (Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, 
Pacific Islanders) had ever received a mammogram. (Also in the poll: 41.7% of 
black women over 18 surveyed had received a mammogram.) 
</P>
<P>
A low number of Asian women are getting mammograms despite the fact that the 
ACS in the last few years has regularly publicized free or low-cost mammograms 
($50 instead of fees up to $180). 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a language problem, an access problem, I don't know," Anton-Culver 
said, but she believes that a special effort should now be made to screen 
Asians for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Poll results also showed that while women in their 50s and 60s were likely to 
have had three or more mammograms (respectively 40.8 and 42.2% of those groups 
reported having several mammograms), older women had mammograms less 
frequently. For instance, only 35% of women in their 70s had had three or more 
mammograms and 34.5% of women in their 80s reported three or more mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Anton-Culver said, the survey showed that education appears to influence 
the frequency of seeking mammography. She found that 46.2% of women with an 
education level of eighth grade or less had lower frequency levels compared to 
49.2% of those with ninth- to 12th-grade education and 56.2% for those with a 
college education.

KEMP PROMISES TO PUSH FOR U.S. HOUSING FUNDS, DECRIES 'BARBARIC' CUTS 
</P>

<P>
Saying that federal budget cuts affecting the poor and homeless "would be 
barbaric," U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp pledged 
Thursday during a visit to Orange County to push for continued funding of 
federal housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
"From my standpoint," Kemp said during a news conference, "I think it would be 
barbaric to try to balance the budget off the backs of poor people, or off the 
backs of the family, or off the backs of abused women and children." 
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, Kemp toured Human Options, a shelter for battered 
women in Laguna Beach. The shelter is seeking federal funds to establish a 
one-year transitional housing program for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
He praised Human Options' approach to coordinating its services for women and 
children with other local and federal programs. It is the most cost-effective 
way to spend public funds for social problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the shelter could serve as a nationwide model, Kemp agreed to help the 
agency secure federal funds to purchase a small apartment complex for temporary 
housing for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp was invited to visit the shelter by his sister-in-law, who serves on the 
nonprofit agency's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
During his tour of the shelter, he heard from former clients who eventually 
moved into federally subsidized housing under a separate program. 
</P>
<P>
A former client named Leigh, who did not want her last name used, told Kemp 
that 3 months after her premature baby was born, she left an abusive husband 
and sought help at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Through help from a housing voucher -- she pays 30% of her income toward her 
rent and HUD picks up the rest -- and money from the Aid to Families with 
Dependant Children program, she said, she was able to afford college and day 
care for her children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to achieve some goals," Leigh told Kemp. "There's no way that 
without housing, that I could do this." 
</P>
<P>
Human Options Executive Director Vivian Clecak said women and children often 
leave home without money or documents and only the clothes on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty to 60% of the women who go back (home) do so because they cannot find 
decent, affordable housing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 40% of the agency's revenues come from state and county sources, 
Clecak said. The 11-year-old organization serves an estimated 3,000 clients 
each year, provides temporary housing for women and their children for up to 45 
days, operates a crisis intervention hot line and offers post-shelter 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, federal Section 8 housing vouchers had been available to 
shelter clients through a program administered by the city of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said that money to restart the voucher program, as well as other housing 
programs, is in an appropriations bill pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He restated opposition to laws prohibiting illegal immigrants from receiving 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
HUD has threatened to withhold community development block grant funds if the 
city of Costa Mesa carries through the policy proposed by Councilman Orville 
Amburgey. 
</P>
<P>
"I think frankly, if applied nationally as the councilman wanted to apply it in 
Costa Mesa, it would be discriminatory, would be a violation of civil and human 
rights, and frankly, I am not going to participate in anything that denies 
people their basic human right to emergency treatment and compassionate social 
services," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the housing department is preparing a regulation that would bar 
"discrimination on the basis of (legal status) in connection with certain 
emergency public services."

An Iowa motorist was killed early Thursday when her car drifted into a center 
divider and slammed into a paramedic van that was parked on the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Irlmeier, 19, of Audubon, Iowa, was driving south at 1:30 a.m. near the 
Sand Canyon Avenue off-ramp when the accident occurred, California Highway 
Patrol Officer Keith Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
For an undetermined reason, she veered her Toyota Cressida into the emergency 
lane, where an Orange County Fire Department paramedic van was parked, 
Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics had parked the van in the lane to retrieve a piece of equipment 
left after an earlier minor traffic collision, Thornhill said. Two members of 
the paramedic crew were standing along the freeway when Irlmeier rear-ended the 
van, but neither was injured. 
</P>
<P>
She was killed instantly.

While you are busy griping about the price of gas and deciding who to blame, 
don't forget that the majority of you idiots voted for a gasoline tax increase 
last June, the first 5 cents of which went into effect Aug. 1.

TWIST DROPS TO THIRD WITH ONE RACE TO GO

Jory Twist of Newport Harbor Yacht Club dropped to third place with one race 
remaining after a premature start disqualified him from the seventh race in the 
U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex Junior Sailing Championships Thursday off Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the day's second race (eighth in the series), Twist, Orange County's only 
entry, placed second, putting him in third overall. Despite Thursday's setback, 
Twist still has a chance; only four points separate the series' top three 
sailors. Twist could regain the lead if he wins today's final race and if 
Houston Yacht Club's Scott Elting, the series leader, finishes sixth or worse. 
</P>
<P>
As required by race rules, officials hailed three premature starters -- Twist, 
Amy Rosenfeld of Island Heights (N.J.) Yacht Club and Manning Montagnet of Pass 
Christian (Miss.) Yacht Club -- in the seventh race, but only Rosenfeld 
responded and restarted. Rosenfeld finished seventh in the race. Officials said 
that neither Twist nor Montagnet responded to the hail and continued to sail 
the course. A premature start is treated as a DNS (did not start) and Twist and 
Montagnet were each penalized 10 points, which is worse than a last-place 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure yet the results are final," Twist said after Thursday's races. 
"I did not know I was over (the start line)." Twist expects to protest the 
premature start, he said, and if his protest is upheld, it could nullify the 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In the tightly contested Laser class, only one point separates the top three 
racers. With only one race remaining, the leaders are Mike Hare of Houston 
Yacht Club, first place; David Houser of Coronado Yacht Club in San Diego, 
second place, and Brett Davis of St. Petersburg (Fla.) Yacht Club, third place. 
</P>
<P>
Davis started slowly in the five-day, 10-race series but won four consecutive 
races before placing second in the ninth race Thursday. He has 23 points to 22 
for Hare, who won the ninth race, and 22 3/4 for Houser. 
</P>
<P>
In the Flying Junior class, Bill Hardesty of Mission Bay Yacht Club in San 
Diego slipped to fourth -- his worst finish all week -- in the first of two 
races but won the second to retain first place, with two races remaining today. 
</P>
<P>
In second place, 3 1/2 points behind Hardesty is Jesse Andrews of American 
Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. Andrews' next closest competitor is trailing by 15 1/2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Wind for Thursday's two races was eight to 10 knots from the south-southwest. 
Seas were flat, but a substantial swell was running. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day racing event ends today with final races that will determine the 
series winners. Winners will become part of the 1990 U.S. Junior sailing team.

CHRIS COUCH FINDS TIGER ON HIS TAIL

<P>
Tiger Woods of Cypress shot a three-under-par 69 Thursday to pull within one 
stroke of the lead after the third round of the PGA Junior Championship at the 
PGA National Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, 14, the youngest player in the tournament, trails Chris Couch of North 
Lauderdale, Fla., heading into today's final round. Last March, Couch, 17, 
qualified for the Honda Classic, becoming the youngest player to compete in a 
PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Couch shot a 70 for a 54-hole total of 215. He has led all three days 
of the tournament, but has seen Woods, the precocious challenger with the 
prodigious swing, edge ever closer. Couch and Woods were paired in the final 
foursome Thursday and Couch was impressed by some of Woods' shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Tiger's the best 14-year-old I've ever seen," Couch said. "I'm going to have 
to play really well to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Couch started the day two shots ahead of Woods, but Woods pulled into a tie 
heading into the fourth hole by parring the first three while Couch had two 
bogeys and a par. 
</P>
<P>
Couch regained the lead for good on the par-four No. 4 when he made birdie and 
Woods had a double-bogey. Woods buried his approach shot in a bunker in front 
of the green, blasted out, then three-putted. 
</P>
<P>
Woods' round of 35-34 included seven birdies and two bogeys in addition to the 
double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for that one hole I three-putted, my putting was great," Woods said. 
"If I play as well (today) as I did (Thursday), I'll win." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his cocky attitude, Woods said he isn't an aggressive player. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for me is to continue to play steady," he said. "All I want to do is 
hit as many fairways and greens as I can in regulation and try not to putt more 
than twice on any one hole." 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who shot 73-74 the first two rounds, credited time on the driving range 
and a dry shirt for his three-under-par round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Woods was spraying the ball all over the fairway Wednesday and was so disgusted 
with his play that he headed straight for the driving range, where he remained 
until dark. There, Woods tinkered with his grip and on Thursday he was back to 
driving the ball straight and long. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing Woods noticed during Wednesday's heat and humidity was how his 
sweat-soaked shirt was sticking to him and affecting his backswing. So he took 
an extra shirt with him Thursday and changed after nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got everything straightened out now and I'm ready to go after the title," 
Woods said. "I don't feel any pressure because nobody around here ever heard of 
me. The pressure will be on (Couch) because he's the local favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who took his first swing at a golf ball in his parent's garage when he 
was 11 months old, has been winning golf tournaments since age 5, when he won 
the first of his record five Junior World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Woods shot 63 in the La Mirada city junior championship the day 
before leaving for Fort Worth, Tex., where he won the Big 'I' Insurance Junior 
Classic by three strokes. In a driving contest before that tournament, he drove 
a ball 310 yards. This from a youngster who is 5-foot-9 and 120 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a kid, I guess," Woods said. "Once I get on the tour, I expect to 
average 300 and hit it like Greg Norman." 
</P>
<P>
An honors student, Woods' ambition is to play professional golf. He doesn't 
want to be the next great black golfer. He wants to be the next dominant 
player, period. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tear it up on the tour," he said.

MIDEAST FEARS PUT STOCKS INTO WORLDWIDE DIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: TOKYO'S EXCHANGE PLUNGED 5.8%, THE FOURTH-BIGGEST ONE-DAY DROP IN 
HISTORY; THE DOW FELL 3%. OIL PRICES SKYROCKETED TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fearing that a Mideast war would cause economic chaos for much of the 
industrialized world, investors continued to bail out of stock markets from New 
York to Singapore on Thursday, sending prices on nearly every major exchange to 
their lowest levels in at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 76.73 points, or 3%, to close at 
2,483.42 -- the lowest close since July, 1989. But the selloff was nothing 
compared to the rout in Tokyo's market, where the value of the Nikkei stock 
index fell 5.8% -- the fourth-biggest one-day drop in history. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of war in the Mideast also sent oil prices rocketing. The price of the 
benchmark U.S. crude rose 71 cents Thursday in New York to $31.93 a barrel, the 
highest level in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, long-term interest rates soared anew as investors dumped bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, everyone (in the stock market) rushes for the exit, and some 
people get trampled," said Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, U.S. stocks were worth $95 billion less than they had 
been the day before. Share values have slid by more than $500 billion since 
July, when prices peaked, according to Wilshire Associates, a Los Angeles firm 
that tracks the value of shares traded on the nation's largest exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in oil prices was a major factor in the stock selloff. Investors 
believe that petroleum production in Saudi Arabia and other Mideast nations 
could be abruptly curtailed if war breaks out between the United States and 
Iraq. That would send oil prices and inflation soaring, which could cause 
economic problems in any nation that depends on petroleum imports. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of such a scenario rippled through market after market Thursday. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index fell 3.5%, and, in London, the value of the 
FT-SE 100-stock index slid 1.4%. The Paris CAC 40-stock index closed down 2.1% 
and the Hong Kong market tumbled 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese market's plunge took the Nikkei average of 225 stocks down 
1,473.28, to close at 23,737.63. The Nikkei had not been below 24,000 since 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In early Friday trading, Japanese stocks turned up, rising 607.62 on the 
Nikkei, on reports of Iraqi troop pullbacks. But analysts said the 
bargain-hunting was unlikely to last. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing drop of stock prices in the United States prompted some U.S. 
firms to announce plans to buy back some of their shares. Fannie Mae, the 
government-sponsored, publicly held firm that buys mortgages from lenders, 
announced plans for a buyback, as did Intel Corp., the big computer chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. market analysts said investors have become increasingly hesitant to hold 
stocks because many believe that a war with Iraq is imminent. "There were no 
peaceful sounds yesterday," said Michael Sherman, chief investment strategist 
at Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although war always makes investors nervous, a war in the Middle East is 
particularly worrisome because it would probably affect worldwide oil supplies 
and prices. Rising oil prices fuel inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates sometime later this year 
to help spur the weak economy. But it is believed to have delayed rate cuts 
because of fears of oil-driven inflation, and some analysts believe that the 
central bank may continue to delay further easing for some weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 250.4 million shares 
changing hands, compared to 175.5 million Wednesday. Only 148 stocks advanced, 
while 1,643 fell. 
</P>
<P>
Investors sold virtually everything they could, including the oil and gold 
stocks that had rallied in recent weeks on the Mideast crisis. Blue-chip losers 
included Boeing, off $2.50 to $42.50; IBM, off $2.125 to $96.875; Procter &amp; 
Gamble, off $3 to $71.125, and Exxon, off $1.75 to $49.625. 
</P>
<P>
The broader measures of stock market performance also declined steeply. The 
NYSE Composite index fell 5.34 to 168.88, a 3% loss. The NASDAQ Composite index 
of over-the-counter stocks plummetted 14.62 to 360.22, down 3.9%.

Pessimism about the economy has reached a level unseen since the early 1980s, 
when the United States fell into the worst recession since World War II, 
according to a New York Times-CBS News poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of Americans believe the country is already in a recession, the 
poll found. 
</P>
<P>
About 55% of respondents said they believe the economy is worsening, while 40% 
said it is staying the same and 4% said it is improving. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in telephone interviews with 1,422 Americans from Aug. 
16 to Aug. 19. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points.

STYLE: CUSTOM SHOES AND WIDE STYLES AVAILABLE FOR HARD-TO-FIT FEET 
</P>

<P>
From its humble appearance, few would guess that Gia Shoe Design of U.S.A. 
attracts an occasional movie star or rock 'n' roll singer. 
</P>
<P>
The shop in a small strip shopping center in Garden Grove has none of the 
polished brass and studio lighting of finer shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, patrons are greeted by the smell of cement glue and the sound of 
workers hammering away on leather soles. Cardboard boxes, scraps of leather and 
unfinished shoes fill every corner of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Yet people from as far away as Hollywood and San Diego make pilgrimages to the 
no-frills shoe store because here they can order custom shoes in any size or 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"When people from Hollywood make a movie and need a 16th-Century-style shoe, I 
design it," says John Tran, owner of Gia Shoe Design. 
</P>
<P>
If someone wants a blue suede shoe in Size Triple E, Tran will have a pair 
ready in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, finding shoes to fit feet that don't conform to shoe 
manufacturers' rigid sizing has been as easy as squeezing a square peg in a 
round hole. Customers with wide feet usually had a narrow selection of styles. 
</P>
<P>
Today people with hard-to-fit feet are finding it easier than ever to be 
well-shod. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon's in Westminster specializes in wide shoes with a fashion flair. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a few years ago, women with wide feet had to wear old lady shoes. 
(Wide shoes) were very conservative-looking," says Hugh Salomon of Pasadena, 
owner of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon used to operate a family shoe store which his own wife couldn't shop at 
because the store didn't stock wider shoes. When he opened his first shoe store 
in Pasadena six years ago, he had to persuade shoe manufacturers to make their 
current styles in wider sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently no one went to the manufacturers and told them of the need," he 
says. Now he has 25 to 30 manufacturers supplying him with wide shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can offer high fashion shoes in a variety of colors," he says. "They're 
shoes for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Most stores carry only Size B or C widths. Salomon's offers women's shoes from 
Size 5 to 11 in wide and extra wide sizes, up to a Triple E. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of women are squeezing into Bs" who should be wearing wider shoes, 
Salomon says. "Some are very vain and wouldn't wear a Triple E-width shoe. But 
these shoes are styled so they don't look wide." 
</P>
<P>
His store carries a pair of metallic flats in pewter with tiny gold studs for 
$64.95, soft penny loafers in burgundy, tan and black for $55.95 and leather 
pumps with patent leather toes and brass buckles in purple, green, tan and 
black for $66.95. There are suede pumps in a rich shade of purple, black suede 
flats studded with colorful rhinestones and loafers in a multicolored faux 
snakeskin. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves Market, with stores in El Toro, Fullerton, Costa Mesa and Los Alamitos, 
sells boots in sizes to accommodate urban cowboys with large feet. 
</P>
<P>
At Thieves Market, one can find a lizard skin or alligator boot in sizes up to 
15 or 16, in widths up to Triple E. 
</P>
<P>
"We cater to the hard-to-fit," says Richard Downes, vice president of Thieves 
Market. "About 75% of our sales are in the Size 9 to 11 range, but it's the 
remaining 25% that we're after. Nobody else is offering (these sizes)." 
</P>
<P>
Those who can't find a shoe in the style or size they want from ready-to-wear 
shoe stores can have them custom-made at Gia Shoe Design. 
</P>
<P>
From a shelf above his desk, Tran pulls down what looks like an ordinary shoe 
box, lifts the lid and reveals its strange contents: 
</P>
<P>
Inside there's an impression of two feet in a Styrofoam mold, with one foot 
slightly larger and wider than the other. Tran will use the impression to 
design a pair of shoes according to the feet's dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
"This way the shoe fits exactly the way the customer wants it to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoes have cork inserts built inside or one heel that's higher than the 
other for customers with foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I also make shoes for very tiny feet. These are a Size 2," Tran says, holding 
up a small pair of women's pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can bring in a picture of a shoe from a magazine and Tran will draw 
up a pattern for it. Some bring a swatch of material and order shoes cut from 
red velvet or pink brocade. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have a fancy dress, we can build a shoe to match," says Tran, as he 
cuts out a shoe pattern from a piece of caramel-colored leather. 
</P>
<P>
His ankle boots with their pointed toes and crocodile trim have proved popular 
with teen-agers and rock singers. One singer had Tran design a pair of lace-up 
black patent leather boots. 
</P>
<P>
He charges about $100 to $300 for a pair of custom shoes, and about $300 to 
$400 for corrective shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Tran keeps patterns and sketches of shoes he has designed in an overstuffed 
binder. 
</P>
<P>
In a back room, workers sew together pieces of leather that have been cut from 
Tran's pattern. The so-called leather upper is then stretched over a mold 
shaped like a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
One worker glues the heel to the sole, then the sole is attached to the leather 
upper. Finally, the shoe is cleaned and buffed. 
</P>
<P>
Gia Shoe Design makes 40 to 50 pairs of shoes a day -- enough to supply Tran's 
Garden Grove store and his five other franchise stores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe manufacturers often hire the company to make prototypes of new styles for 
national shoe fairs. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, 49, immigrated from Vietnam in 1975 and has been making shoes since 1956. 
After working for several American shoe companies, he opened Gia Shoe Design in 
1983. A reminder of his native country stands in a corner of the shop -- a 
small altar with an Oriental statue of the Lucky Man. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to invite in customers," Tran explains. Especially those with wide feet.

GEARING, DRAFTING AND CADENCE GIVE TOP CYCLISTS THEIR EDGE

<P>
If you ride bicycles at all, chances are this has happened to you: You're 
heading down Coast Highway, maintaining a steady 18 m.p.h., feeling strong, 
when without warning a pack of riders zips by, their seemingly effortless 
cadence a smooth 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In seconds, it seems, they are gone. And all you remember is the silence of the 
paceline, the way their legs seemed to move in total unison, the pack wasting 
no energy as it worked as one, each rider using the draft and taking turns at 
the front in balletlike symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
This is cycling as it is supposed to be -- the pack working as one, the 
paceline straight and the speed steady, the legs pumping in harmony, backs flat 
and heads low, elbows bent. 
</P>
<P>
What these riders have that you don't is technique. It's not the $2,500 bikes 
they may be on but the knowledge of gearing and drafting and cadence that sets 
them apart and allows them to ride faster and longer and smoother. And 
unfortunately, it's not something that comes naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Put two riders side by side, the same age and in the same physical condition, 
both of them avid enthusiasts putting in 150 miles a week, and the one who will 
excel on the hills and keep it at a steady 30 m.p.h. on the flats will be the 
one who has paid attention to the subtleties of technique. 
</P>
<P>
You can put in 200 miles a week and have quads the size of an oak tree, but if 
you take a hill in the wrong gear, or fall even so much as half a bike length 
off the paceline, that group riding in formation like the Blue Angels will 
leave you behind like some kind of wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
Fast road bike clubs see this happen all the time. They come upon a lone rider 
astride a shiny custom bike equipped with triathlete bars, who jumps on the 
rear of the paceline. Everything is fine until the first hill, or when the club 
picks it up on the flats, and suddenly that interloper is 100 yards back, 
exhausted and spent, the victim of too little attention to the things that make 
great riders great. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson here is if you're serious about biking at all and are committed to 
putting in the miles, you'd do well to pay attention to experienced riders and 
racers. It will go a long way toward improving overall performance -- without 
increasing your mileage. 
</P>
<P>
And even if your goal isn't to keep up with the racers, there's nothing like 
organized group riding to pick up some tips from the old pros. 
</P>
<P>
Most bikers find it's a small step from those lone rides with one or two 
friends to the excitement of group riding. It's like going from a disposable 
camera to mastering a Nikon and setting up a darkroom in your garage. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the popularity of biking here, Orange County offers a wide cross 
section of organized clubs catering to everything from the weekend recreational 
cyclist looking to put in a slow 25 miles to the serious riders and racers who 
think nothing of knocking off a 70-miler averaging a quick 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the number of clubs, there seems to be something for just about 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about cycling," said biking enthusiast Rudy Fernandez, 52, of 
Irvine, "is that no matter at what level you are doing it, you can find a club 
to ride with, no matter how old you are. There are people out there 40, 60 and 
70 who don't give an inch to anyone younger than them." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who has been riding for years, has seen the sport through boom and 
bust times and said the current cycle is one of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"You have all kinds of organized bike tours, different types of clubs, the U.S. 
Cycling Federation racing, the touring clubs and then all the small clubs that 
take it quite seriously. There's something for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The largest local club is the Orange County Wheelmen, which boasts 950 members 
and offers training classes, rides for beginners and club-sponsored century 
rides of 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
If you're into the social aspect of riding or merely want to increase your 
speed and distance while picking up some valuable tips, this may be the group 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club of Irvine is a recreational, non-racing club offering over 40 
rides a month. It too offers non-threatening rides for beginners and longer 
rides for the recreational cyclist, and you can learn something about pack 
riding and staying out of the gutter after a few trips out. 
</P>
<P>
A slew of smaller clubs, many sponsored by local bike shops, offer everything 
from easy recreational rides (say 20 miles and a stop for brunch) to fast-paced 
60-milers with no stops. 
</P>
<P>
More demanding than the Wheelmen or the Irvine club and requiring a greater 
commitment -- not to mention experience and ability -- are clubs such as those 
sponsored by Bicycles Etc. of El Toro and BS Bicisport of Laguna Hills. Both 
offer coaching and emphasize technique and speed over distance. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycles Etc. is a co-sponsor of the Nissan-Schwinn team that races 
competitively in U.S. Cycling Federation events. At Bicisport, former Romanian 
Olympic cyclist Marcel Calborn has formed a core group composed of racers and 
professional men -- ranging in age from the mid-20s to mid-50s -- who ride five 
to six times a week. 
</P>
<P>
For those bold enough to think they can move with the best, there are several 
rides that attract the local elite. But be warned: Don't bother even showing up 
unless you're ready to ride like the wind. These men and women are fast. 
</P>
<P>
Como Street: This curiously named ride (there is no Como Street in Irvine but 
apparently there used to be one in the area when the ride began in the 1950s) 
starts on Jamboree Road west of the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine every Sunday 
around 8:30 a.m. The ride usually runs between 36 and 45 miles and has been 
known to attract up to 300 riders. The pack normally splits as the weak lose 
the draft and fall behind. 
</P>
<P>
* Coffee Crew: This 7 a.m. Saturday ride follows a 35-mile loop and starts in 
Corona del Mar. Not for the weak at heart. 
</P>
<P>
* Foodpark: This starts at 8:30 a.m. Saturdays at Foodpark in Irvine and runs 
for about 35 miles. Another fast one but not as demanding as Como Street or 
Coffee Crew. 
</P>
<P>
And finally there is the "Ziggurat" training ride, a 1.4-mile loop around the 
pyramid-shaped Chet Holifield federal building in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The "Zig" takes place each Tuesday and Thursday starting around 5:30 p.m. and 
ending at dusk. A pack of usually 50 to 60 shows up and does about 40 miles 
around the loop, taking 90-degree corners at 40 m.p.h. and riding so close you 
can read the label off your neighbor's bike jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Szkalak, 37, a triathlete who now devotes most of his energy to bike 
racing, notes that the Zig can be particularly demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"This ride is occasioned by world champions from time to time," said Szkalak, 
who lives in Dana Point. "It is not unusual for pro riders to seek out the Zig 
or Como Street when they're in the area." 
</P>
<P>
But with so many clubs and organized rides around, you don't have to compete at 
the Zig to enjoy cycling. Still, with a little attention to technique, you 
might think you'd want to give it try.

TOO MANY GOALS, EXPECTATIONS CAN SIDELINE A PLAYER'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY R. MAY, Distributed by Psychology Today. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of my work as a sports psychologist has been with highly skilled athletes. 
These men and women use psychological techniques to get the most out of their 
already finely tuned physical abilities. 
</P>
<P>
But I've found that many recreational athletes -- people who play golf or 
tennis on the weekend, say -- try to use the same techniques. They read books 
and magazine articles by well-known athletes and coaches, purchase equipment 
endorsed by them and practice hard. 
</P>
<P>
When they try to use a star's psychological approach, however, their techniques 
are usually incomplete, unsystematic and unsophisticated. A salesman I'll call 
Bill is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big day for Bill -- a chance to play golf with his company's 
president, an important client and another salesman. He had been practicing 
every night for two weeks and had his best round of the year the previous 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But when he hit a few balls on the practice tee before the round, his 
confidence started to fade. He shanked three 7-iron shots in a row. Frustrated, 
he pulled out his driver and tried that. His old slice had returned. 
</P>
<P>
He started to panic. "The client will think I'm a klutz." "The boss will never 
give me the account." As he tried to relax, he remembered reading how Jack 
Nicklaus prepares for a tournament by visualizing what he wants to do on each 
hole. Bill closed his eyes and saw himself scoring a birdie on the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
As he teed up, his thoughts were still hectic. "I wonder how I look." "Whatever 
you do, don't slice." "I hope I get the account." He swung, watched the ball 
arch into the woods on the right and slammed his driver to the ground. He was 
in for a long day. 
</P>
<P>
What had Bill done wrong? A lot of things, but mainly he had botched his mental 
rehearsal. In trying to follow Nicklaus' example, he had visualized the result 
he wanted -- getting a birdie -- rather than concentrating on the specific 
steps of addressing the ball correctly, centering his weight carefully and 
swinging completely through the ball. 
</P>
<P>
He also had too many goals and expectations. Bill was thinking about pleasing 
the boss, impressing the client and beating the other salesman when he should 
have been focusing on the real task at hand: Playing each shot as well as he 
could. And he forgot a cardinal rule of any sport: Relax and have fun. Instead, 
he became tense and didn't know the proper techniques to relieve his tension. 
</P>
<P>
Used properly, psychological techniques can help recreational athletes as well 
as professionals reach their full potential. Here are brief rundowns on some 
valuable techniques and advice on how to use them correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Goal-setting: Long-term objectives, such as winning a tournament or beating 
some specific time for the 100-meter backstroke, are really dreams rather than 
goals; they don't give you a way of achieving what you want. In contrast, 
setting task-specific goals such as being "loose and energetic," concentrating 
on the "reach of the stroke" and periodically thinking "high in the water and 
fast" are steps that can really help you reach your dream. 
</P>
<P>
Think in terms of simple, specific goals to improve what needs work. Use 
longer-range dreams as motivators to keep you going. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxation training: The tranquillity and peace produced by relaxation allows 
athletes to concentrate fully and be better prepared to meet the demands of 
their sport. This is the sequence that I recommend for reaching this state: 
</P>
<P>
1. Focus attention on each muscle group, starting at your forehead and moving 
down to your toes. 
</P>
<P>
2. Tense one muscle group. 
</P>
<P>
3. Maintain the tension for a period of 5 to 7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
4. Release the tension. 
</P>
<P>
5. Concentrate for 20 to 30 seconds on the pleasant sensations in the muscles 
as they relax. 
</P>
<P>
6. Repeat the sequence for each muscle group in turn.

Baritone Hector Vasquez, 32, has won the $4,000 top prize in the San Francisco 
Opera Center's Merola Opera Program finals. 
</P>
<P>
One of 20 young, competing singers, Vasquez took the Schwabacher Memorial 
first-prize award for singing excerpts from Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," 
Gounod's "Faust" and Verdi's "Falstaff." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much a boost for your career," Vasquez said by phone Thursday from 
his home in Brea. "But also on a personal level, it's the recognition of your 
work that it brings. It's a very nice thing to have that acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez also said he has just accepted an offer of an appointment with San 
Francisco Opera as an Adler Fellow, a two-year, training-residency program that 
offers master classes and coaching sessions as well as singing some roles in 
the yearly repertory. The program will begin in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez was last heard in Orange County in May, 1989, singing the bass solo 
arias in Bach's "St. John Passion" with the Orange Coast College Singers 
directed by Richard Raub. Since then, he also has sung in a national tour with 
Western Opera Theater, at the Schoenberg Institute in Los Angeles and at the 
Ojai Summer Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of five San Francisco Opera Center singers going on a week's tour of 
Micronesia, which began Thursday, ., and is scheduled to sing in a Western 
Opera Theater national touring production of Donizetti's "Lucia di 
Lammermoor."CHRIS PASLES

MUSEUM REOPENS AFTER WATER LEAK

<P>
The Laguna Art Museum closed Tuesday after officials discovered 18 inches of 
water from an underground spring in an elevator shaft and strong fumes that 
reportedly smelled like gas. 
</P>
<P>
No damage was reported, however, and the Fire Department, though still 
monitoring the situation, was not concerned about fire or other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The museum reopened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am about 90% sure it's not a problem, and today (Thursday) I authorized them 
to go ahead and run the elevators," Laguna Beach Fire Department Battalion 
Chief Joe McClure said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McClure said the leak probably stemmed from the failure of a worn, 5-year-old 
sump pump, designed to continually drain the elevator shaft area below the 
three-level museum's basement floor. 
</P>
<P>
The flooding probably caused a container of elevator hydraulic fluid to spill, 
causing the noisome fumes, said McClure, who intended to check the site again 
today.

IRAQ BLOCKS EUROPEANS AT BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES: BAGHDAD HAS SAID COUNTRIES NOT AIDING THE BLOCKADE COULD WITHDRAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi authorities stood firm Thursday against the release of civilian hostages 
whose governments support the blockade of Iraq, and they threw up new barriers 
in front of the few families promised safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish and Swiss authorities, whose nations have not contributed ships to the 
blockade, said busloads of their nationals made the 30-hour drive from Baghdad 
to the Turkish border, only to be blocked in most cases by Iraqi frontier 
guards who said their papers were not in order. 
</P>
<P>
This took place on the eve of the ordered closure of all foreign embassies in 
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The United States, the 12 members of the European 
Community, the Soviet Union and Japan, among other countries, say they will 
defy the order. Among the foreigners trapped in Kuwait are 4,000 Britons and 
about 2,500 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw on Thursday, Polish workers returning home from Iraq said they saw 
Iraqi guards escorting more than 30 Americans into a chemical plant where the 
Poles had been working. This was interpreted as evidence that Iraq is carrying 
out the "human shield" policy it has threatened to use as a deterrent to 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz told two United Nations 
envoys that release of any hostages would "be linked with intentions of the 
United States," whose land and naval forces dominate the military blockade of 
Iraq. With Jordan's belated -- and still reluctant -- compliance, the 
U.N.-mandated sanctions appear to have become virtually airtight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad Television on Thursday broadcast a meeting between President 
Saddam Hussein and a group of hostages, many of whom spoke with British 
accents, among them several children. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to get to know you under other circumstances," he said 
through an interpreter. "We hope your presence here is not going to be long." 
</P>
<P>
But there appeared to be no easy way out even for foreigners assured that they 
could leave the Iraqi strongman's embattled country. Baghdad has said that 
countries not contributing ships to the blockade would be allowed to withdraw 
their nationals. But only 21 of the 43 Swiss who reached the Turkish border 
were permitted to cross. 
</P>
<P>
In Stockholm, a spokesman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Lisette-Lindahl 
Owens, said only a few of the 90 Swedes who managed to get to the Turkish 
border had been allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know anything yet about the practical details," she said, "just that 
they allowed only a small part of the Swedish group to cross." 
</P>
<P>
European news reports said that a group of Finns also were barred from leaving 
Iraq. Baghdad has hinted that French and Japanese nationals might be allowed to 
leave. This was interpreted as an attempt to erode the international commitment 
to the blockade imposed soon after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Japan 
rebuffed the apparent Iraqi offer Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In an "open letter" read over Baghdad Television on Thursday evening, Hussein 
responded to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's emotional appeal for a 
withdrawal from Kuwait in order to avoid "a destructive war that will devour 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein asserted that he was the victim of a conspiracy and that Saudi Arabia's 
King Fahd had plotted against him. He said he had possession of a July 9 tape 
recording -- "a gift from God," he called it -- that proved the king's 
complicity. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who is not known as a devout Muslim and heads a professed secular 
state, said Mubarak should join him in a struggle against "nonbelievers and 
corrupt people." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, reverberations from the standoff have pushed world oil prices to 
more than $30 a barrel, the highest level in five years. Sadek Boussena, 
president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, reportedly has 
called for an informal meeting of the cartel's members Sunday in Vienna. Saudi 
Arabia has argued for a full-scale emergency meeting in order to discuss 
increased production levels that might hold prices down. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states of Bahrain and the United Arab 
Emirates have issued further calls for military recruits. With small 
populations, they are incapable of raising a significant force, but the move 
underlined the solidarity of the sheikdoms, buoyed by the presence of heavy 
Western military deployments in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Tom King, Britain's secretary of defense, said in London that his government is 
sending a squadron of 12 Tornado fighters to Bahrain, which last week granted 
Britain the use of its air bases. A squadron of Tornados was sent to Saudi 
Arabia shortly after the Iraqi invasion, and a similar unit of Jaguar 
fighter-bombers was deployed to Oman. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no British land forces have been ordered to the region. French military 
authorities announced Wednesday in Paris that they were deploying a 180-member 
reconnaissance unit to the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing buildup has not budged Hussein, who has flatly rejected 
international demands that he withdraw his forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts continue, but they are given little hope of succeeding. 
Jordan's King Hussein flew to Sana, Yemen, for discussions with Yemen's 
president, Col. Ali Abdullah Saleh. Both Jordan and Yemen are members of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council, but the council has been fractured by the angry break 
between its two big powers, Egypt and Iraq, as a result of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most difficult situation the Arab nation has faced so far," King 
Hussein said before leaving Jordan, "but I am confident we will inevitably 
reach our aims and goals if we follow the shortest path." He was accompanied by 
his prime minister, Mudar Badran. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said he hopes to visit in Baghdad with the Iraqi president, whom 
he acknowledged he has not talked to in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Arab officials in the gulf states say King Hussein does not have the influence 
to be an effective mediator. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled Kuwaiti regime is also mounting a diplomatic push for support in the 
crisis. Foreign Minister Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah flew to Tehran for talks with 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to news reports, Rafsanjani 
stuck to the line of opposing the occupation of Kuwait and expressing concern 
over the Western presence in the gulf, which forms Iran's southwestern 
coastline.

JUDGE CLEARS JUDAS PRIEST OF LIABILITY IN 2 SUICIDES

Hidden words do exist on an album by the British rock band Judas Priest, but 
they were not placed there intentionally and the group is not responsible for a 
suicide pact formed by two young fans, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead said the alleged words "do it" were 
the result of a chance combination of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the two victims sued the band and CBS Records, claiming 
messages hidden in the crashing music of the 1978 "Stained Glass" album touted 
satanism and promoted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Belknap, 18, died from a single blast from a shotgun held in his mouth 
Dec. 23, 1985. James Vance, then 20, blew away the lower portion of his face 
but survived three more years before his death on Thanksgiving, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers contended that subliminal messages, including the words "do it" 
allegedly hidden in the song "Better by You, Better Than Me," spurred the 
shootings. They also charged that the album contained backward messages touting 
death, satanism and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The defense maintained the phrases were "phonetic flukes," given credibility 
only by the power of suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
In clearing the band of liability, Whitehead said that CBS Records refused to 
properly comply with discovery orders involving the original master tape of the 
album. He said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers but by 
in-house counsel of CBS. He ordered the company to pay $40,000 to the 
plaintiffs' attorneys to reimburse them for the cost of bringing the lawsuit.

Pro-Iranian Muslim extremists in Lebanon today freed Irish hostage Brian Keenan 
after more than four years in captivity, Iran's official news agency said.

<P>
"Irish hostage Brian Keenan has just been set free in Lebanon," the Islamic 
Republic News Agency said in a brief dispatch from Beirut. He was believed to 
have been handed over to Syrians and to be on his way to Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan, an Irishman who also holds British citizenship, has been held in 
war-torn Lebanon since his abduction April 11, 1986, in Muslim West Beirut. He 
taught English at the American University of Beirut.

A federal appeals court ruled today that the government is acting properly in 
setting auto mileage standards without preparing formal environmental impact 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in a 2-1 decision, rejected a series of lawsuits by the state of 
California, the cities of Los Angeles and New York and several environmental 
and safety groups challenging the way the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration sets annual standards for the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented, saying the agency acted arbitrarily 
when it determined its mileage standards would have no significant impact on 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic agency sets mileage standards that auto makers must achieve as an 
average for their models each year. The standard was 26 miles per gallon for 
model years 1987-88 and 26.5 for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The government entities, the Center for Auto Safety, Public Citizen, the Union 
of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed suits 
covering mileage standards for 1987-88. Most of the same plaintiffs joined a 
suit over the 1989 standards. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling rejected all of the complaints.

PENNSYLVANIA ABORTION LAW PROVISIONS BARRED; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: CLAUSES MAKING THE STATUTE THE MOST RESTRICTIVE IN THE U.S. ARE 
DISALLOWED. AN APPEAL IS PLANNED.

<P>
A federal judge today struck down provisions of Pennsylvania's abortion law 
that helped make it the most restrictive in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III ruled on challenges to the law 
by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania and five abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
Huyett struck down portions of the law that require a woman to notify her 
husband before getting an abortion; wait 24 hours before getting an abortion, 
and require minors to obtain the consent of at least one parent, or a court 
order, before an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. territory of Guam had banned all abortions except where the mother's 
life is threatened. A federal judge ruled that law unconstitutional Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pennsylvania ruling, the judge said that requiring parental notification 
"unduly burdens a minor woman's right to elect to end her pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides have said they will probably file appeals first to the 
U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Safe, legal abortion continues to be accessible to women in Pennsylvania 
because of the court's decision today," said Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, 
executive director of Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
"Pennsylvanians would be well served if the Commonwealth accepts this decision 
and stops squandering taxpayers' money to promote government interference in 
personal matters and threaten women's lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Huyett quoted Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun's warning about eroding 
abortion rights: "The signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind 
blows." 
</P>
<P>
"What the future holds is not certain," Huyett said. "But one thing must be 
evident. Individuals can no longer feel as secure with the protections provided 
by the judiciary in this area. Instead, a woman's privacy rights and individual 
autonomy may soon be subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process."

Ships carrying a West African peacekeeping force with orders to end Liberia's 
civil war arrived today off the capital, Monrovia, but rebels said they would 
fight it. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet of four warships and a cargo vessel did not attempt to land its 3,000 
soldiers but tried in vain to raise port authorities on the radio, diplomats in 
contact with their embassies in Monrovia said. 
</P>
<P>
The ships carrying troops from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria, Gambia and Ghana 
made radio contact with the U.S. Embassy, which promised to inform Monrovia's 
port. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Tom Woewiyu said in neighboring Ivory Coast that the rebels 
would attack the force sent by five of the 16 members of the Economic Community 
of West African States. The rebels say the community favors embattled Liberian 
President Samuel K. Doe.

A Coast Guard radar plane returning from a patrol for drug smugglers caught 
fire and crashed early today near a U.S. naval station in Puerto Rico, killing 
all four men aboard. 
</P>
<P>
They were the first deaths for the Coast Guard since it began drug-smuggling 
interdiction work in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The E-2C Hawkeye, a twin-engine turboprop radar aircraft, crashed about 500 
yards from the runway at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station at 12:21 a.m., said Lt. 
Cmdr. Jeff Karonis, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami. The naval station is in a 
remote area on the east coast of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The crew was coming in for a landing after completing its patrol and reported 
to military air traffic controllers that there was a fire aboard the aircraft, 
Karonis said. The crew also reported hydraulic problems.

Adidas AG, the world's leading sporting goods maker, said its losses surged to 
$72 million last year from $6 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Adidas, in which French entrepreneur Bernard Tapie unexpectedly acquired a

itself to meet increasing competition and expects better results next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Adidas group will achieve considerably better results in 1990 than in the 
previous year," it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Tapie bought his stake in Adidas, known internationally for its athletic 
footwear, last month for $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Adidas' sales rose to $650 million in 1989 from $595 million the previous year, 
helped by increased exports and sales of licenses for its products.

URBAN DEVELOPER KILLED IN BOSTON PLANE CRASH;

A twin-engine private plane crashed today in a driveway between two houses in a 
crowded residential neighborhood, killing the president of a major urban 
development firm, his wife and daughter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, which occurred in fog and light rain, also set the two houses on 
fire, but no one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Killed was Michael Spear, the president of Rouse Co., a downtown developer 
whose projects included the Harbor Place on the Baltimore waterfront, the 
Faneuil Hall shopping area in Boston, the South Street Seaport in New York and 
the revitalization of Underground Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Also killed were his wife, Judith, 47, and their daughter Jodi, 19. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the agency that runs Logan International 
Airport, identified Spear, 49, as the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine turbo-prop Piper Cheyenne was bound for Logan International 
Airport from the Cape Cod town of Chatham, the Federal Aviation Administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spear aborted his first approach to Logan about 6:24 a.m. because he could not 
slow the plane, the FAA said. Controllers told him to climb while circling west 
over Boston but Spear responded that his left engine was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The plane dropped off radar at 6:33 a.m., crashed and burst into flames in the 
driveway between the two single-family homes in the city's Mattapan section, 
setting both houses on fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the occupants of one house were away on vacation and that five 
people in the other house fled to safety. Neighbors said a man who lived in the 
house helped two women and two children escape out a window and suffered minor 
injuries in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Spear was president of Rouse Co., the largest publicly held real estate 
development company in the nation, since 1986.

General Motors Corp. has offered its hourly workers 2% raises, while Ford Motor 
Co. has proposed a lump-sum bonus in their first contract proposals made to the 
United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Neither car maker has demanded any reductions in benefits or asked employees to 
share expenses for health insurance, sources close to the negotiations said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
That in itself encouraged UAW negotiators, who have been bargaining since 
mid-July for new three-year labor pacts with GM, Ford and Chrysler for about 
500,000 U.S. auto workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no serious takeaways, which gave rise to optimism," one UAW source 
at Ford told the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
Both car makers and the union declined to officially reveal specifics of the 
offers made Thursday while they are under review by the UAW. But sources said 
the contract offer by Ford included a lump-sum payment in the first year 
instead of a base wage increase.

Postal officials and union leaders today formally opened what will likely be 
months of grueling contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the parties will communicate together and work together to gain a 
contract marked by fairness and flexibility," Postmaster General Anthony M. 
Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped Postal Service is preaching moderation, meaning it 
hopes that workers will hold down their financial demands. 
</P>
<P>
But union leaders say their members should not suffer because of management's 
inability to improve efficiency and hold down costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the public to be gouged, but we're not going to take the blame 
for poor management either," said Moe Biller, president of the American Postal 
Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
Labor contracts between the U.S. Postal Service and its four largest unions 
expire Nov. 20. The labor groups represent 660,000 workers.

Insurance costs are also to be discussed at the meeting. Insurance premiums for

Texas Rangers third baseman Steve Buechele was suspended for three days for his 
part in a melee Aug. 17 with the Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buechele charged the mound, prompting both benches to clear, after he was hit 
by a pitch from Greg Hibbard. Buechele was ejected from the game and missed 
four of the next five games with a back injury and a sore left rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers General Manager Tom Grieve said the American League office informed the 
team of the suspension Thursday night.

UMPIRES FIRE BACK AT PHILLIES

<P>
The head of the umpires union has formally complained to the National League 
president about the Philadelphia Phillies' criticism of umpire Joe West 
following the club's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Union chief Richie Phillips said he asked league President Bill White to punish 
Phillies Manager Nick Leyva and General M anager Lee Thomas for their "savage 
attack" on West following the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It is outrageous that the Phillies use the umpires as a scapegoat," Phillips 
told the Philadelphia Inquirer. "It is absolutely ludicrous that Joe West, or 
any other umpire, in any way or fashion has a vendetta for the Phillies." 
</P>
<P>
West, working first base, ejected Von Hayes after Hayes criticized home plate 
umpire Harry Wendelstedt. Hayes said he was talking to his first-base coach. 
West said Hayes "cursed" Wendelstedt and deserved ejection. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Thomas said West had "tried to play God on us" and Leyva said 
West "just isn't a professional" and was trying to "stick it" to the Phillies. 
On Thursday, Leyva called West "arrogant" and said, "he's got this macho thing, 
he's got to show everybody that he's the boss."

<P>
Defending champion Steinlen heads a field of 14 horses invited to run in the 
10th Arlington Million on Sept. 2, officials of Arlington International 
Racecourse said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other American horses, three from England and one from Canada complete the 
lineup, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The six alternates, to be moved up in case of scratches, consist of four 
Americans and two Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
No Irish or French horses are entered this year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Steinlen, the other U.S. horses in the top 14 are: Alwuhush, Classic 
Fame, El Senor, Golden Pheasant, Pleasant Variety, Prized, Saratoga Passage, 
Ten Keys and Double Booked, who was moved up from the alternate list after 
Canada's Charlie Barley was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Barley suffered a swollen ankle Thursday after a gallop at the Woodbine 
track in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The invitees from England are Batshoof, Isle De Chypre and Ile De Nisky. The 
remaining Canadian is With Approval. 
</P>
<P>
The alternates, in order of entry credentials, are Colway Rally, Nediym, Drum 
Taps, Slow Fuse, Granacus and Secret 'n Classy. The last two are from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse, originally the first alternate, was declared out Thursday, 
letting Double Booked replace Charlie Barley. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, a 7-year-old owned by the Wildenstein Stable, has won three of seven 
starts this season, including the Hollywood Turf Cup at Hollywood Park and the 
Caesars International at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
A field of 10 headed by No Marker has been entered in Saturday's $300,000-added 
Cabrillo Handicap at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
No Marker is coming off stakes victories in Washington and Kentucky. He will be 
ridden by Aaron Gryder and was assigned 116 pounds for the 25th running of the 
1 1/8-mile race for 3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered were Notorious Pleasure, who will be ridden by Laffit Pincay and 
was assigned 116 pounds; Charlatan, Patrick Valenzuela, 113 pounds; Royal 
Reach, Chris McCarron, 113 pounds; Rogue's Realm, Alex Solis, 112 pounds; 
Double Quick, Kent Desormeaux, 111 pounds; Silver Circus, Eddie Delahoussaye, 
111 pounds; Lowell, Julio Garcia, 111 pounds; Bosphorus, Rafael Meza, 111 
pounds, and Miserden, David Flores, 110 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If all 10 entries go to the post, the total purse will be $326,300 and the 
winner will earn $191,300. 
</P>
<P>
No Marker last raced on July 15 when he won the Budweiser Breeders' Cup 
Handicap at Longacres outside Seattle. Before that, the 6-year-old son of Grey 
Dawn II won the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs in Kentucky on June 
23. 
</P>
<P>
No Marker has nine career wins and earnings of $475,833. 
</P>
<P>
Notorious Pleasure will be running on dirt after five straight races on turf.

CHILDREN NO. 1 TO JACLYN SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
Jaclyn Smith says her children come first. The former "Charlie's Angel" star is 
in Toronto shooting an NBC movie and took her children, Gaston, 8, and 
Spencer-Margaret, 4, on location. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't work if I didn't have them," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing would come together. If I decided to leave them back at home, they 
wouldn't like it, I wouldn't like it and we'd all be miserable." Smith says she 
would consider another television series because it would allow her to be home 
in Los Angeles during the school year. She would also like to try the New York 
stage again, but it would complicate her family life too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not in the cards for me right now because I'd have to uproot my 
children and take them to New York or travel on the road with them," she said. 
Another thing Smith doesn't expect to be doing soon is a "Charlie's Angels" 
reunion with Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson. "They (producers) have talked 
about it, but, you know, it's not going to be," she said. "I think we've all 
moved on."

LIZ SMITH: 'FLATLINERS' PARTY TO BRING REAL STAR POWER TO FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THERE'LL BE some real star power at the Deauville Film Festival in France. For 
instance, Columbia's hot hit "Flatliners," which is No. 3 at the box office and 
has made $30 million in just two weeks, will field producer Michael Douglas, 
director Joel Schumacher and two of the movie's most fascinating actors, Julia 
Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
They arrive in France on Sept. 1 to "make nice" with the press and to make a 
little whoopee. 
</P>
<P>
MORE MADONNA: Gloria Ruiz, a reader of this column, has taken me to task 
because I criticized 2 Live Crew and not Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
I don't always like Madonna's off-color jokes from the stage. (One she told her 
French Riviera audience was in gaspingly bad taste and anti-female, but I 
figured maybe Madonna didn't realize what she was saying.) However, for all her 
crotch grabbing and exhibitionism, underneath Madonna's popular image is a 
humanist one. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna doesn't encourage a society that abuses women physically, nor one that 
attacks gays or blacks. Even in her outrageous "Blond Ambition" tour recently, 
she made sure there were references to safe sex and condoms. Despite the 
controversy she arouses and those she offends, she is still a responsible 
performer who cares about issues -- AIDS, the environment, racism. She speaks 
out for causes. 
</P>
<P>
There's a big difference between "trashy" behavior (that's in the eye of the 
beholder, I guess) and rapping about physically damaging women during the sex 
act. And how much "fun" it is to do so. Children are more likely to be hurt and 
to hurt others from the latter. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about the "literary ladies" coffee to which Eleanore Kennedy 
invited women in the Hamptons so that they might meet her pal Ivana Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The ladies were asked to wear miniskirts. Some of them did. 
</P>
<P>
EVEN IN crisis, there are jokes. The Washington gag goes that President Bush 
will name Roseanne Barr as our new ambassador to Iraq.

<P>
A federal appeals court today upheld rules that require would-be radio or TV 
licensees such as home shopping channels to make only the briefest assertions 
that their programming will serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling affirmed an important part of the overall deregulation of 
broadcasting that began in the early 1980s under the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose when challengers tried to prevent the Federal Communications 
Commission from awarding licenses in Cleveland and Baltimore to subsidiaries of 
the Home Shopping Network, whose round-the-clock sell-a-thon stations hawk 
merchandise to television viewers through telephone orders. 
</P>
<P>
HSN stations typically devote a small portion of their days to public affairs 
or news shows in order to meet FCC requirements that stations provide 
"non-entertainment programming responsive to issues of concern in the community 
to be served." 
</P>
<P>
Due to revisions the FCC made beginning in 1981, license applicants currently 
must make only a "brief narrative description" of proposed programming that 
indicates they understand and intend to comply with their public service 
obligations -- and not make specific promises of what their programming will 
be.

TEAM PROSPECTS FOR 1990-91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Kernen, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
'90 Finish: 39-22, 2nd in NCAA Division II 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Good. Last season's young team won the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. championship and reached the NCAA Division II title game. Eight starters 
will be back in '91. The Matadors will be as good as their pitching, which was, 
at times, an achilles heal even in Division II. Scott Sharts and Craig Clayton, 
both of whom tried out for Team USA, would star on any major college team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basketball 
</P>
<P>
(Men's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pete Cassidy, 20th season 
</P>
<P>
'89-90 Finish: 12-15, tied for 4th in CCAA 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Poor. The Matadors have been no better than an average NCAA Division 
II team since 1985, the last season CSUN reached the playoffs. Cassidy will 
have to replace three of last season's five starters, which could be considered 
either good news or bad news. Northridge is expected to open the season with 10 
new players. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basketball 
</P>
<P>
(Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Janet Martin, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
'89-90 Finish: 11-18, tied for 2nd in CCAA 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Poor. Mediocre plays pretty well in Division II, but it gets buried 
against most Division I competition. CSUN reached the championship game in the 
CCAA tournament last season despite a losing record. Northridge was winless in 
five games against Division I teams last season. The return of a healthy 
Bridgette Ealy will help some. The Matadors also will have a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross-Country 
</P>
<P>
(Men's and Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Don Strametz, 10th women's season, 7th men's season 
</P>
<P>
'89 Finish: women 4th, men 5th in NCAA Division II championships 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Poor on the men's side. The team was fifth in the NCAA Division II 
championship meet in 1989, but it has lost two of its top runners. Sasha Vujic, 
eighth in last season's championship meet, is a potential national qualifier in 
Division I. On the women's side, the forecast is fair. Division II champion 
Darcy Arreola returns for her senior season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Bracken, 5th season 
</P>
<P>
'90 Finish: 3rd in NCAA Division II 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Good. Northridge may not be quite ready for prime time players like 
USC and UCLA, but the Matadors have been competitive in tournaments with other 
Division I teams for a number of years. Bob Burns, NCAA Division II individual 
champion last season, provides a good nucleus to build around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soccer 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marwan Ass'ad, 8th season 
</P>
<P>
'89 Finish: 10-5-4, 2nd in West regional 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Fair. Good Division I teams are too physical for CSUN's liking, 
through the Matadors have experience with bruising matches thanks to annual 
exhibition matches with UCLA. Coach Marwan Ass'ad has orchestrated a loyal 
following among community youth soccer programs, but their initial expectations 
may be a bit too high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Softball 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary Torgeson, 10th season 
</P>
<P>
'90 Finish: 51-21, 2nd in NCAA Division II 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Good. Northridge had a winning record (19-16) against Division I teams 
last season, so a .500 record next spring is certainly possible. Torgeson's 
most pressing concern would be pitching. Debbie Dickmann, a top-caliber pitcher 
at any level, has completed her eligibility. If CSUN finds a suitable 
replacement, it has an outside shot at a regional playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swimming 
</P>
<P>
(Men's and Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pete Accardy, 22nd season 
</P>
<P>
'89-90 Finish: women 2nd, men third in NCAA Division II championships 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Fair. If anyone can make something out of nothing, Accardy can. With 
little funding, he developed programs that were annual contenders for Division 
II national championships. CSUN won't scare any top teams at the major college 
level and is unlikely to have more than a couple of individuals qualify for the 
Division I meet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tennis 
</P>
<P>
(Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tony Davila, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
'90 Finish: 14-13 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Poor. Competing in Southern California is tough at any level without 
sufficient funding. Davila says his program lost good recruits in the past 
because it carried a Division II label. Northridge teams historically have a 
few top individuals. Depth will be even more of a factor in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Track 
</P>
<P>
(Men's and Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Don Strametz, 10th women's season, 5th men's season 
</P>
<P>
'90 Finish: men 2nd, women 5th in NCAA Division II championships 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Fair. CSUN will concentrate its efforts on winning dual meets since it 
will have few individuals qualify to compete at the national level. On the 
women's side, nationally ranked middle-distance runner Darcy Arreola is 
expected to challenge for national title in 1,500 after a redshirt season last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
(Men's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Price, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
'89-90 Finish: 13-12, 2nd in division of WIVA 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Excellent. The program has competed in the Division I Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. since 1984. The Matadors were ranked in the 
national Top 10 all of last season and placed second behind UCLA in the WIVA's 
DeGroot Division. CSUN defeated Pepperdine last season and came within a point 
of knocking off both USC and UCLA. With all six starters back, a Final Four 
berth is possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
(Women's) 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Walt Ker, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
'89-90 Finish: 26-11, qualified for regional 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Good. Four starters are back from last season's team that finished 
26-11, including Kathleen Dixon, a two-time Division II All-American at middle 
blocker. CSUN has defeated Division I teams in the past, but playing to that 
level on a regular basis figures to be much more difficult. Still, Northridge 
should fit right in with the second half of the nation's Top 20 teams. 
</P>
<P>
The football program will continue to compete in the NCAA Division II Western 
Football Conference.

Heavyweight boxing champion James (Buster) Douglas says he was so moved by a 
note from a homeless girl that he sought her out and paid her a surprise visit 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that keeps me in tune to how fortunate I am and the blessings 
that I can pass along to someone else," Douglas said of his meeting with 
12-year-old Paula Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
While Douglas was visiting the Columbus Boys' Club in late May, Paula had a 
handwritten note delivered to him. It asked Douglas to visit the Faith Mission, 
where homeless people stay. 
</P>
<P>
"She said that she was homeless and how much she loved me," Douglas said. "She 
invited me to come down to the shelter to show people that I do care about 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas visited the shelter twice, hoping to meet the girl and her family. But 
they had already found a home. So he tracked her down and paid her a surprise 
visit at school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing," Paula said."When I would see him on the news, I would never 
think in my life that I would ever meet him." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has tried to help Paula's mother find a job and has bought gifts for 
the family and clothing for the girl.
