The Machine of the Moment has transmitted everything from press releases to 
take-out restaurant orders. And now, a new use. . . . 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood business executive Anita Gittelson showed up for work and found 
that an assistant had tendered her resignation via a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit strange," Gittelson said. "She was in Syracuse, N.Y., when she 
sent it. In fact, it's strange that she was even in Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Los Angeles City Council positions aren't the most high profile jobs, but 
you'd think that voters would be able to remember which members are alive. 
</P>
<P>
Six constituents of Councilman Joel Wachs phoned his office in a panic Thursday 
after an item about a Chatsworth newsletter was reported here. The newsletter, 
for some reason, said that a building's plaque "was to be personally presented 
by an old friend, Mr. Joel Wachs, Councilman, (but) Mr. Wachs passed away just 
prior to its unveiling." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs spokesman Greg Nelson said of the mourners: "At least someone could have 
sent flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Or faxed a card. 
</P>
<P>
Now Money magazine says that Los Angeles is the 13th most liveable area in the 
nation, ranking ahead of Orange County (No. 23), by the way. 
</P>
<P>
This follows assorted studies concluding that, compared to other regions in the 
United States, the Freeway City is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 9th most stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 2nd most romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 10th most stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 2nd most health-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 11th dirtiest and least safe in which to raise a family.

Sounds like the typical Angeleno is a hard-driving businessman who flirts on 
the jogging track and doesn't shower afterward.

<P>
Why are the 600 people pictured in the shape of a No. 10 smiling? Simple. They 
don't battle the freeways alone each day. These Transamerica Life Co. employees 
were marking the 10th anniversary of their van-pooling program. 
</P>

As they tell drivers in Pasadena: Smile, you're on photo radar.

This Week's Sushi Attack: 
</P>
<P>
When last we heard from Bonese Collins Turner, she had a painting showing an 
order of sushi pelting the HOLLYWOOD sign, one of a series on display at the 
Angel's Gate Gallery in San Pedro. Now comes a similar onslaught on the Theme 
Building at Los Angeles International Airport. Weren't the sushi controllers 
awake?

Vic (the Brick) Jacobs, the Channel 13 sportscaster with a werewolf's voice, 
throws a chunk of foam at the screen when he wants to signify a miserable 
performance. Jacobs admits that his next honoree should be . . . himself. 
</P>
<P>
He was playing in a charity softball game in Long Beach the other day when "I 
made a sudden move and froze with a pain in my leg," said Jacobs, 36. "I 
figured a golf ball had hit me because there's a course nearby." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs had to sit out the rest of the game. Later, in the locker room, he was 
informed that he'd pulled a muscle. 
</P>
<P>
An enterprising worker at a refreshment stand in the Hollywood Bowl set out a 
box with a sign that said: "Ten Reasons Why You Should Tip." 
</P>
<P>
Sample reasons: 
</P>
<P>
No. 10: "Elvis did last week." 
</P>
<P>
No. 8: "Minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
No. 7: "Guilt." 
</P>
<P>
No. 4: "We want to rent a Rob Lowe video." 
</P>
<P>
Guilt was in short supply. When last seen, he had a total of one quarter in his 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Give him the brick, Vic.

ELECT VISIONARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front-page article (Aug. 6) about George Bush, the "environmental 
president" who isn't really, made me angry at every wishy-washy popularity 
seeker I have ever voted for. President Bush seems to be afraid to support or 
oppose environmental issues because somebody, somewhere is likely to disagree 
with him, and that might make him unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
We need to find, and to elect, a few visionaries who are willing to make a 
stand and stick to it. It would be nice if they were also articulate and made 
occasional statements that weren't completely predictable.

PAUL ROBERTS AND STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a card-carrying member of the ACLU, I was deeply affected by Paul Craig 
Roberts' recital of the tribulations of W. Glenn Campbell; how he has been so 
persecuted for "helping to devise the outlines of the Reagan Revolution". 
</P>
<P>
From my reading of the press and magazines I can testify that the Hoover 
Institution has ably contributed a cutting edge to such institutions as the 
American Enterprise Institute and Roberts' own Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in their amassing of tendentious data espousing financial 
and military aid to the dictatorships of Latin and Central America. They helped 
us justify setting up and keeping in power such sterling examples of 
government-by-death-squad as those of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and 
subsidizing drug peddlers like Noriega in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
For such great services to humanity it is shabby treatment indeed that Campbell 
should resign with only a six-year contract as counselor to the Institution, 
albeit with "substantial salary boosts." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest an added grant, to enable him to visit the grateful recipients of his 
ideological knuckleballs: the killing fields of El Salvador; the burned-out 
peasant cooperatives of Nicaragua; the mothers of the "disappeared" of 
Argentina, and Chile, and Uruguay.

SHELTER IMPERATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Half a million of the poorest men, women and children in Los Angeles live in 
houses, apartments, garages or cardboard boxes that are either too expensive, 
too dangerous or too flimsy. For a city with the wealth and potential of Los 
Angeles, housing conditions are both scandalous and critical. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a new City Council housing committee headed by Gloria Molina is 
a good sign that city officials finally are prepared to give the city's housing 
disaster the attention it demands. Molina is determined to get a proper housing 
effort organized, to get the hammers swinging and concrete pouring and to 
concentrate on the areas of greatest need. 
</P>
<P>
Molina soon plans to take up one proposal that is crucial to solving the 
housing shortage. Her committee will consider creation of a strong commission 
of housing experts, civic leaders and others who care deeply about the plight 
of people without decent housing and who can, among other things, get the 
city's many housing activities moving in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important than a watchdog role, a commission of people dedicated 
to cleaning up the problem could serve as a valuable source of ideas for 
raising money, for long-range planning and creative new approaches to housing 
without getting tangled up in politics. Mayor Tom Bradley's blue-ribbon housing 
committee recommended such a body months ago; it is past time to act on the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs more money to address housing needs and it must move 
aggressively to get it. One potential source would be a fee on commercial 
construction that would raise money for housing. That is a sound idea. The 
workers in those new office buildings will need housing. A fee of $7.50 a 
square foot would raise $75 million a year for housing. The City Council has 
called for bids for a study, required by law, to determine if commercial 
development has any environmental impact on housing needs. Also at issue is 
whether such a fee would slow up development in the downtown area or other 
parts of the city. Similar fees have been levied in other cities, including 
Boston and San Francisco, without creating a drag on new development. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families are trapped in poor housing. They live in old brick 
apartments threatened by earthquakes, in housing projects invaded by crime, in 
airless garages and in other cramped quarters. They can do no better. Los 
Angeles can and must do better.

PAUL ROBERTS AND STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take serious objection to the Op-Ed article by Paul Craig Roberts (Aug. 15) 
which attacks Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
I am a graduate of Stanford (undergraduate economics), and a member of the 
Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution. I am a life-long Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Having served as a Hoover overseer for four years, I would characterize the 
mood of our board as extremely hopeful and positive, looking forward while 
acknowledging that serious errors of tact and judgment have been committed by 
both Hoover and Stanford in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
(Hoover Director) Glenn Campbell will always be a hero at Hoover. It is also in 
keeping with the philosophy of those other great members of the Stanford 
family, John Gardner and Ernie Arbuckle, to acknowledge that periodic change is 
healthy, both institutionally and individually. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Reagan Library, it was accepted unanimously by the Stanford 
trustees. While there was considerable debate, the faculty senate did not turn 
down the Reagan Library. I would suggest that Glenn Campbell's heroic 
impatience had as much to do with its demise at Stanford as any other single 
entity. 
</P>
<P>
Labeling the Stanford faculty leftist -- "there was no place for moderates or 
reason . . . . either you hated America or were a war criminal" -- is more 
revealing of the character of Paul Craig Roberts than of the Stanford faculty. 
Michael Boskin, Hoover Fellow, senior faculty in economics and currently 
chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisors, as well as David 
Brady, Hoover Fellow, senior faculty in political science and Stanford Business 
School, are but two examples of the caliber of faculty slurred by Roberts' 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts goes on to criticize Stanford's budgeting process. Deficits are planned 
for in the current university budget in order to absorb the extraordinary 
expense of raising $1.1 billion in the Centennial Campaign without curtailing 
the ongoing educational and research programs. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Centennial Campaign, Roberts asserts, "Stanford's fund-raising 
efforts were running behind the weak performance of last year." Last year's 
"weak performance," $181.9 million, was No. 1 among private universities in the 
United States and well ahead of Harvard for first place nationally. It was the 
first billion-dollar campaign ever announced by a university. It has survived 
the stock market crash, higher capital gains rates and even Paul Craig Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover and Stanford are two institutions which have contributed greatly to the 
West and to the world at large. They will each contribute greatly in the 
future, and they are worthy of our support. What such worthy institutions need 
and deserve are individuals who are willing to live with their imperfections 
and work to make them better. Roberts' laundry list of hackneyed, provocative 
and unproven charges represents hide-bound negative conservatism at its worst.

DEFINING RAPE AND RAPISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
King and McCaughey stated that "getting your date drunk to get sex from her" is 
rape. But how can a man possibly get his date drunk? Does he put a funnel in 
the woman's mouth and pour alcohol into it? Does he inject alcohol into her 
bloodstream intravenously? Does he force her to drink at gunpoint? I don't 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
If a woman voluntarily goes out with a man, voluntarily drinks alcoholic 
beverages until she is drunk, and then (while still conscious) fails to resist 
her date's sexual advances (or fails to otherwise indicate that she does not 
consent to his advances), then her date has the right to assume that she has 
consented to his sexual advances, and the resulting sex at is not rape. This is 
true even if she later regrets having had sex with him and even if she would 
not have had sex with him if her inhibitions had not been lowered by the 
alcohol.

UNION COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm still unhappy with your story ("Unions' Future Questioned After Summer of 
Setbacks," Aug. 15) on the AFL-CIO convention in Chicago. It presented a gloomy 
view of organized labor's problems with, of course, some optimistic balance 
from Lane Kirkland and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Inexplicably, though the story rated a half-column on page 1 and a half-page 
inside, it never mentioned the Beck decision (Communications Workers of America 
vs. Harry Beck) by the Supreme Court last year, establishing the right of all 
union members to withhold their dues from any union agenda relating to 
political or social activities with which they disagree, while retaining full 
union representation, pension and welfare benefits. This is the single most 
significant event in the American labor movement in 50 years. It's a dark 
thunderhead looming over the future of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
The Writers Guild strike last year, one of the longest (five months) and most 
bitter in the history of the film industry, collapsed a few weeks after the 
Beck decision, when a dozen major writers threatened to claim limited . . . 
membership under its terms. Beck ended mandatory union solidarity as a 
condition of employment. Because of this, I predict there will never be another 
major strike in the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
It's widely suspected among union activists that the media are participating in 
a conspiracy of silence on the Beck decision. ("If we don't report it, it 
didn't happen, it doesn't exist.") Your coverage of this story supports that 
unsavory conclusion. The Times is one of the nation's major newspapers. Don't 
you think you should cleanse your reputation on this issue?

MORNING BRIEFING: FAVORITE QUARTERBACKS IN BOOK OF BRADSHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Bradshaw has more Super Bowl rings than any other quarterback, but he 
doesn't claim to be the best. Here's what he says about some other 
quarterbacks, as excerpted by the Pittsburgh Press from his soon-to-be-released 
book "Looking Deep": 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana: "His ability to run the two-minute offense and throw touch passes 
were two qualities I wish I had." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino: "I don't know if I've ever seen a quarterback like Marino. He has a 
quicker release than I did and could read defenses better. I don't kid myself, 
I could never match his statistics, even in Miami's system." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Namath: "I loved Namath for his style, because he had a walk about him and 
was admired by everybody from the ladies to the media." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Stabler: "Absolutely my favorite of all time. I was jealous of him because 
he could do things I couldn't do. And he did them gracefully. Our defense would 
get in his face and he still piled up the yardage, still threw down the middle, 
still threw outside." 
</P>
<P>
Add Bradshaw: Of Mark Malone, his understudy with the Steelers, he said: "I 
initially liked Malone, but then I realized he was a phony. People said he 
looked like Tom Selleck, so he grew a mustache like Selleck, combed his hair 
like Selleck and even wore flowered shirts like Selleck. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always saying the 'right' things to the press. After eight years of 
that stuff, they finally traded him to San Diego. He was just too hip and 
players didn't appreciate him pointing the finger at somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What Dodger pitchers finished 1-2-4 in the voting for the Cy Young 
Award in 1974? You guessed it: It was just the other day that Detroit Tiger 
Manager Sparky Anderson figured out how he wouldn't have to explain the 1989 
season in years to come. He would claim he got hit in the head by a ball in 
spring training and suffered amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened Wednesday night? Anderson was hit in the head by a ball off 
the bat of Gary Ward in batting practice. Sparky was knocked to the turf for 
several minutes, but he got up and walked away under his own power. 
</P>
<P>
How-times-have-changed Dept.: When Red Barber announced the first televised 
baseball game 50 years ago, the sponsors were Mobil, Ivory Soap and Wheaties, 
and Barber did commercials for all three without benefit of script or 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
He told Norman Chad of the Washington Post: "First, I held up a bar of Ivory 
and said something about it being great and 99% pure, and then I held up a can 
of motor oil and ad-libbed a few words about the excellent quality of this 
Mobil motor oil. When it came time for Wheaties, I poured a box of Wheaties 
into a bowl, sliced a banana real quick, put in some sugar and milk and said, 
'This is the breakfast of champions.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mike Marshall, Andy Messersmith and Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Pittsburgh Pirate bullpen coach Rich Donnelly, hearing that a new 
national sports newspaper is in the works: "There's so many papers now that 
it's going to cost you $12 a day to eat breakfast."

TENNIS ROUNDUP;

<P>
CONNORS STARTS FAST, BUT IS FINISHED OFF 
</P>

<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, Jimmy Connors acted his age. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-ager Jim Courier defeated Connors, a last-minute replacement for ailing 
Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, Thursday in the first round of the 
$154,000 Hamlet Challenge Cup at Jericho, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
For Connors, whose record 107 victories include five U.S. Opens, it was his 
first match since Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I hit the ball pretty well considering I haven't played in a while," he 
said. "I'm in pretty good physical shape and I just want three or four more 
days of practice before the Open next week and I'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Connors, No. 15 in world rankings, replaced Edberg, ranked third, when Edberg 
withdrew because of hives. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Courier wasn't born when Connors, who turns 37 next week, 
played in his first U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the greatest player in the game when I started getting interested in 
tennis," Courier said. "I try to emulate his 'never-say-die' attitude in a 
match." 
</P>
<P>
Courier won the first four games of the second set to get back into the match, 
then won the last four games of the final set as Connors ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, unseeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden upset eighth-seeded Yannick 
Noah of France, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6); Robert Seguso needed just 56 minutes to 
defeat Carl Uwe-Steeb of West Germany, 6-2, 6-4, and sixth-seeded Andrei 
Chesnokov of the Soviet Union beat Jimmy Arias, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Navratilova beat No. 9 Helen Kelesi, 6-3, 6-3, and 
second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina beat Barbara Paulus, 7-5, 6-0, and 
advanced to the quarterfinals of the Canadian Women's Open at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Nana Miyagi of Japan upset No. 12 Radka Zrubatova of 
Czechoslovakia, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5; fifth-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia 
routed Donna Faber, 6-0, 6-0; No. 15 Sylvia Hanika of West Germany defeated 
Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5); Anne Minter of 
Australia beat Catherine Suire of France, 6-2, 6-2; No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat of 
France beat Ann Grossman, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, and fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of 
Spain eliminated Louise Field of Australia, 6-1, 6-2.

INJURIES CAN'T KEEP VETERAN VOLLEYBALL PLAYER OFF SANDY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Stevenson was home. It was the Manhattan Beach Open, down the street from 
his alma mater, Mira Costa High School, and the back yard of childhood friend 
Mike Dodd, where he was introduced to volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, it was Manhattan where Stevenson and Dodd made the big time, 
earning their AAA rating -- the highest level in beach volleyball -- with a 
third-place finish in the open in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But now another nine years had passed and a 32-year-old Stevenson was sure he 
was going to die on the hallowed sand courts below the Manhattan Beach Pier. A 
broken ankle in the off-season, a torn stomach muscle and, now, a recurring 
back injury had escorted the dreaded R word into his psyche. 
</P>
<P>
Retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to do well at Manhattan," said Stevenson, who was playing 
with 21-year-old Kent Steffes, a defector from the UCLA volleyball program, in 
the prestigious event. "My back felt good. It seemed cleared up, so I trained 
and trained. But I over-trained, and the injury came back (in the event's early 
rounds). 
</P>
<P>
"I just barely was able to finish. And here was Kent looking at me like, 'Hey, 
this is Jon Stevenson? The guy who won all those tournaments?' And I just 
wanted to get off the court.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson stuck around and, going into this weekend's USA Championship 
tournament at Hermosa Beach Pier, he has finished in the top four in seven 
consecutive events. The string was highlighted Aug. 12-13 when Stevenson and 
Steffes won the $100,000 Orange County Open in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first pro victory for Steffes, whose work on the beach circuit 
prompted the National Collegiate 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Assn. to declare him ineligible to play for UCLA. "But I think I was 
just as elated about winning Seal Beach as he was," Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
It felt a lot like last year, he said. Teamed with the 6-foot-5 Pat Powers, 
Stevenson earned more than $100,000 in 1988. Powers and Stevenson won six 
tournaments, trailing only the perennially dominant teams of Sinjin Smith-Randy 
Stoklos and Tim Hovland-Mike Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
But for Powers -- like Stevenson -- injuries were devastating. He had rotator 
cuff surgery in the off-season and wasn't able to join the tour until the 
Venice Open in late May. 
</P>
<P>
"That first tournament, he just played on a lot of heart," Stevenson said. "He 
couldn't even lift his arm, but we won our pool anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The next week, Powers sat out and Stevenson played his first tournament with 
Steffes. The pair took third in the Santa Cruz Open, but Stevenson was already 
obligated to play with Powers in Boulder, Colo., two weekends later. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said, 'Sorry Kent,' and went back with Pat," he said. "Then I got 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson's back injury, coupled with Powers' frustration over the slow pace of 
his own recovery, eventually put a strain on the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted so desperately to get back to where we were last year," Stevenson 
said. "He was such an awesome player. At courtside, jaws would drop. He's just 
an animal. But early this year, I think his lack of ability to do certain 
things you have to do to win took a toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Pat is very close to where he was last year. But it was tough for us to 
play together. He had his injuries and I had mine." 
</P>
<P>
So Stevenson went back to Steffes and, eventually, the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it was really gratifying to win with Kent," he said. "It was not only 
the first win for a player with a promising future, but it means that I've won 
with three guys -- Kent, Pat and John Hanley. It's another piece of evidence 
that I can win with different people." 
</P>
<P>
It's also another piece of evidence that Stevenson can overcome adversity. 
Disadvantage No. 1 was painfully apparent when he walked into his first class 
at Mira Costa High. As a freshman, he was 5-foot-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always a little bit smaller, but I was also a little quicker," he said. 
Stevenson was still a standout point guard on the Mira Costa basketball team -- 
he grew to 5-11 before he graduated -- but in those early days he and an even 
shorter friend would entertain themselves taking Super-8 movies of each other 
slam dunking on 8-foot elementary school baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson went to Brigham Young University to play basketball but eventually 
fell in love with beach volleyball and transferred to UC Santa Barbara, where 
he was an All-American indoor player and honor student. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet, he was still relatively small for the beach game when he came out of 
school and played those first three tournaments with Dodd in 1980. But after 
getting the third-place finish in the Manhattan Beach Open, Dodd and Stevenson 
knocked off the top-seeded team of Smith and Karch Kiraly to gain a second in 
the World Championships a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people knew who I was in Santa Barbara, but I was out of nowhere down 
here," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, in one of the highlights of his career, Stevenson and Hanley were the 
top point getters on the tour. But the next year Stevenson was again confronted 
by adversity. 
</P>
<P>
The pro tour introduced the "blocking over" rule, which allowed players to 
reach over the net to block a spiked ball. The rule was perceived as making 
beach volleyball exclusively a big man's game, and it did drive out some of the 
smaller players. But in the fifth season of the rule, Stevenson not only 
remains but has enjoyed more success. 
</P>
<P>
"Before 1985, I had won nine tournaments," he said. "And since then, I have won 
14. So I don't think (the rule) has hurt me too much." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson has tried to make up for the height difference by trying to out-train 
opponents: "I've always placed a high emphasis on training to be competitive 
with the bigger guys." 
</P>
<P>
So it's ironic that it was training that indirectly led to his next brush with 
adversity. Over the winter, he slipped on a quarter at the gym and broke his 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak accident," Stevenson said. "I did my best to stick with my 
(rehabilitation) schedule. But I was doing jumps when I shouldn't have been 
doing them yet when I hurt my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
Despite what he later learned was a torn stomach muscle, he accepted an 
invitation to play in an international beach tournament in Brazil in late 
February. There he irritated the injury and was forced to sit out the next two 
tournaments. And later the stomach tear led to the back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy like me, I don't want to sit on the court all day and play games to 
train," Stevenson said. "Instead, I enjoy lifting weights and other kinds of 
training. But when you're doing things like jump-training, you leave yourself 
open to injury a little more. So once I hurt my ankle, I was doomed." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson says he's healthy and enjoying life as Steffes' teammate. But the 
partnership is less of the teacher-student situation than it appears. Steffes, 
a 6-foot-3 Pacific Palisades product, is not simply a star of the future who's 
waiting for his chance to take over, according to Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it is, in a way, he's taking over now," he said. "He just 
won a $100,000 tournament at 21. He's impressed me a lot. He's handled his 
success well. When I first met him, I could tell he was beyond his years in 
savvy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things I've taught him, sure. But you'd be surprised how even a 
partnership this is." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, who still lives in Manhattan Beach, has done his share of teaching. 
He regularly writes a column on technique for Volleyball Monthly as an 
associate editor, and he has written a textbook on the beach game called "Hot 
Sand." 
</P>
<P>
But now, Stevenson has branched out into another medium. He is working as 
technical consultant for a feature film on beach volleyball, "Side Out," that 
is in production.

5 ERRORS SPELL END TO DREAM OF SAN PEDRO LITTLE LEAGUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A childhood dream ended in a game of giveaway Thursday afternoon when a few 
young players from San Pedro learned about old momentum. 
</P>
<P>
It also took good off-speed pitches from Trumbull, Conn., pitcher Andy Paul and 
five errors by Eastview Little League of San Pedro to knock the Californians 
out of championship contention, 6-3, in the Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Now all that is left for the Eastview All-Stars is this afternoon's consolation 
game, while Trumbull represents the United States in the Little League World 
Series on Saturday against Taiwan, a 13-0 victor over Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro fans reflected on the bizarre turn of events Thursday, which saw San 
Pedro jump in front 2-0 in the first inning on back-to-back home runs by Tim 
Harper and Gary Sloan. But the roof caved in when Connecticut scored five runs 
in its half of the inning, using only one hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, strange road," said Bill Sulentor, whose son, Joe, hit a 
solo shot in the second inning, the last run San Pedro mustered. 
</P>
<P>
Sulentor's feelings summed up the way most of the redshirted Eastview fans felt 
as they milled around the white picket fence outside the players rooms on a 
breezy, much cooler Susquehanna Valley afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, San Pedro did not play well in either of its games here, although it 
banged out 14 hits in its opener Wednesday. On that day these South Bay folks 
could have blamed hot, steamy weather for their team's poor performance, which 
included five walks by pitcher Harper. Southern Californians usually wilt in 
that kind of weather, and the team battled itself as much as it did its 
Southern opponent. Its effort was still good enough to beat Tampa, Fla., 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
The wind changed to a cool northern breeze out of Canada late Wednesday night, 
and for Thursday's game only a few puffy white clouds filled the sky. The 
humidity disappeared. Perfect baseball weather. 
</P>
<P>
So what was it that made Eastview self-destruct? Was it the 19,800 spectators 
who ringed Lamade Stadium? The team committed three first-inning errors and a 
pair of pitchers surrendered four walks. 
</P>
<P>
Boom. It was over. The team from the East Coast led, 5-2, and you could see the 
frustration in the eyes of the Eastview players. Their shouldered sank and, 
although they are not known as a vocal team in the dugout, they appeared to be 
mumbling to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro Manager Joe Dileva said he sensed the tension during warm-up and it 
showed as the team walked up from the practice field to play its game with the 
Eastern representative. Teams aren't allowed to warm up long in the main 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They warm up on practice fields behind Lamade, a quarter of a mile down a hill. 
When it's time to play, they are marched up an asphalt walkway, past the snack 
bars and in view of the horde of fans. San Pedro must have felt the stares. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a bad day, we have a bad day," Dileva said. 
</P>
<P>
League President Gary Miley agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I told Joe, you have to put this loss in perspective. There are 5,000 
Little League teams in the United States and 4,998 of them did not have a 
chance to play in this game." 
</P>
<P>
To the writers in the press box who could see the slumping shoulders from high 
atop the bleachers, momentum clearly played a vital role in the San Pedro 
defeat. Connecticut Coach Tom Galla also saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to get a little flat after we went ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galla credited a pitch he calls "the dart," a change-up, with keeping Eastview 
hitters off guard most of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It took the bat right out of their hands," Galla said. 
</P>
<P>
All San Pedro home runs were hit off fastballs thrown by Andy Paul, a power 
pitcher who resorted to off-speed stuff when he saw that he could not blow 
</P>
<P>
fastballs by the Eastview hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the dart about 75% of the time," he said. "They were swinging at it 
before it left my hand." 
</P>
<P>
That also frustrated San Pedro, which averaged 12.5 runs a game to get here. 
The dart served up seven ground-ball outs (only 18 outs are needed in a 
six-inning Little League game). And Paul struck out the side on the junker to 
end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a machine," Dileva said. "We go out to do a job and today we just 
ran out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro may have run out of gas before it even played its first game, due 
mostly to the inordinate amount of attention the team received because of 
starting first baseman Victoria Brucker, the first girl to get a hit in the 
50-year history of this event. 
</P>
<P>
"When the pressure is big like that it hurts," Dileva said. "They've tried to 
carry the load, but it's hard on a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
All that attention affected the starting rotation for Thursday's game. Dileva 
and Coach Nick Lusic considered starting Brucker at pitcher against Connecticut 
but opted for No. 2 pitcher Steve Williams because, according to Lusic: 
"Pressure really played a part in this game. It really screwed up Victoria's 
head." 
</P>
<P>
Brucker went 0 for 3 Thursday. In her second at-bat there were runners on first 
and second with one out. Lusic said he could tell from the dugout that Brucker 
wanted to hit the ball out of the park, but instead she lifted a lazy fly to 
center. Harper was then doubled up trying to tag and advance to third base. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the loss signaled a welcome end to the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't one of them that is sad," said Harper's mother, Cheryl, about the 
attitude of the team when the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan's father, Gary, called it "a tough loss to take." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 3-1 game if we don't make all those errors," he lamented, standing 
outside the players dorms. 
</P>
<P>
And for the rest of the redshirts that milled around the white picket fence, 
maybe life could get back to normal soon. 
</P>
<P>
For Victoria Brucker, some of it already had. She slipped into her swim suit 
and, headed off to the facility's pool. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the kids these adults came to see are only 12 years old.

CHAMPION FACES STERN CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
KUHN THREE STROKES BEHIND THE LEADER IN L. A. SENIORS GOLF FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She moves steadily from shot to shot at a pace that would make an infantryman 
gasp for breath. 
</P>
<P>
She talks of the discipline of golf, of the test of golf, of the need for 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King at the U. S. Women's Open? 
</P>
<P>
No, Marie Kuhn at the Los Angeles Senior Women's Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, the two-time defending champion, placed second in the event in 1985 and 
'86, the first two years she was eligible. Today, in the final round at the 
Balboa Golf Course, Kuhn must overcome a three-stroke deficit to wrestle the 
championship from Millie Stanley. Stanley shot a 76 to Kuhn's 79, and, as a 
six-time winner of the event, is a definite threat to Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
"I made mental errors today, meaning poor club selection and lack of patience," 
said Kuhn, 54, who lives in North Hollywood and belongs to the Sepulveda Golf 
Club. "After I made a couple of bogies on the back side I lost my patience -- 
that's what begat a couple more. I've just got to back off and be patient." 
</P>
<P>
After seeing Kuhn play, it's hard to imagine her slowing down for anything. A 
typical Sunday morning consists of 18 holes in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the gals if I get to moving too fast, just trip me or something, 
because when I see no one in front of me, I just run," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a definite sense of competitiveness about Kuhn, it is equally 
obvious that she enjoys the game. She will compliment her competitors on their 
shots, take the time to feed squirrels while waiting to tee off and repair any 
divots and scuff marks she encounters. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know each other, " Kuhn said. "Instead of a competitive atmosphere, 
it's more friendly. But we're still not there to throw any shots away. It's fun 
to be with people like that, and still be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn makes room for golf every day, despite the fact that she works full time 
as a film technician. After she gets off work at 4:30 a.m., Kuhn sleeps for a 
few hours and is usually at the course by 8 a.m. for hours of practice. 
</P>
<P>
The devotion has payed off. She recently won both the Southern California 
Women's Amateur and the Los Angeles County Women's Golf Assn. championships. 
However, her winning streak was broken earlier this week at the Pub-Links 
Championship, where she placed third. This affected her play in yesterday's 
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lucky year. The publinks tournament was a bad tournament for me. I 
played very poorly," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely disappointed in myself and so it's quite a downer, it was hard 
for me to pull myself together for today. But a good night's sleep in my own 
bed and I thought, 'Well, I could shoot some numbers,' but I lost my 
concentration on the back side and cost myself a good four more strokes than I 
should have." 
</P>
<P>
Concentration and consistency are the keys to Kuhn's success, and are what she 
will rely on to carry her through today's round. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hit woods better than I can hit irons, I don't want to be able 
to chip better than I can putt. I want to do everything well, because I feel 
that you have to do them all well if you're going to win anything," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although golf first attracted Kuhn about 20 years ago when she met her husband, 
Ken, a former professional golfer, she didn't begin to play seriously until 
five years later. She hadn't been interested in athletics prior to her 
marriage, but golf soon became a way of life, eventually replacing more 
sedentary activities, such as reading and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think 'My goodness, it's consuming me.' I have never in my life 
found anything that was so fulfilling," Kuhn said. "You never reach the highest 
level you can be. There's always something more to attain. That's the carrot at 
the end of the stick. I never plan to give it up."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: ROWE IS SLOWED, TUIOTI STOPPED BY KNEE PROBLEMS

In what otherwise was termed an outstanding day of practice Thursday at San 
Diego State, Coach Al Luginbill had a couple of not-so-pleasant subjects to 
discuss -- both involving knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Patrick Rowe, a junior, is still ailing from an irritation in his left 
knee and may not be ready for the Aztecs' opener a week from Saturday at Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick Rowe's situation has become more doubtful for the opener," Luginbill 
said. "We'll know by Monday." 
</P>
<P>
After the Air Force game, SDSU has a week off before the home opener against 
UCLA Sept. 16. Luginbill indicated he should know by then if Rowe would be 
redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Dennis Arey will start at flanker if Rowe is unable to. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve defensive lineman George Tuioti, a sophomore, has been declared a 
"medical hardship" because of persistent left knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be on scholarship at the university as long as he keeps a 2.0 
grade-point average and continues to pursue his degree," Luginbill said. "It's 
all related to a previous knee injury that medically cannot be corrected." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he and SDSU's medical staff do not want to run the risk of 
having Tuioti permanently crippled. 
</P>

RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
AN EASTERNER LOOKS TO THE WEST AND SEES NOTHING BUT A BLUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In other parts of the country, a race such as the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del 
Mar wouldn't have merited special attention. After all, the purse was only 
$100,000, and the three principal combatants -- Olympic Prospect, Sam Who and 
On The Line -- were merely specialists at the six-furlong distance. But to 
California racing fans, this late July matchup was a compelling attraction, 
because it was a test of the quality they love and admire: pure speed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when a visitor from the East spends time at the tracks here, and 
compares the nature of racing on each side of the country, he can sum up the 
major differences in one word: speed. 
</P>
<P>
When the gate opens for a typical race in the East, a jockey will look to see 
the way the race is going to develop and try to get his horse in a good 
tactical position. If the pace appears slow, he may make a move for the lead; 
fast, he may try to settle behind the leaders. Rarely will a rider put his 
horse in high gear immediately. D. Wayne Lukas, who campaigns on both coasts, 
thinks the Eastern style is based as much on tradition as logic: "Trainers and 
jockeys all say 'Don't rush them' and like to see their horses settle into the 
race. It comes from 50 years of doing it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Here there is no such patience and caution. When the gate opens, most of the 
jockeys will be pushing and shoving furiously, asking their horses to run as 
fast as they can for the first quarter of a mile. In mid-race they may look 
around to examine the tactical situation, but if they have hesitated before 
that, they are already out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
The style is dictated by the nature of the California tracks. Sun-baked and 
very fast, they are conducive to speed. Horses don't tire quickly on them for 
the same reasons that human runners can go farther and faster on an asphalt 
track than they can on a sandy beach. Trainers understand that horses need 
speed to win, and they work to develop that speed. Horses are trained hard and 
fast from the start of their careers. In a maiden race for 2-year-old fillies 
here recently, one of the horses had drilled five furlongs in 57 3/5 seconds; 
another had sizzled a half mile in :46 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Judicious Eastern trainers would rarely drill a young horse so hard; they want 
to teach horses to relax, not to make them speed crazy. Even a great horse like 
Easy Goer would typically work five-eighths in 1:00, a half mile in 48, as he 
was developing. 
</P>
<P>
Californians think their emphasis on early speed is an absolute virtue. "I 
think it's what's made our racing so good," said John Sadler, trainer of the 
brilliantly fast Olympic Prospect. "To be a good horse in California, you've 
got to be able to run all the way." 
</P>
<P>
"East Coast speed," Lukas said, "is not the same thing as West Coast speed." 
Never has this truth been better demonstrated than in the 1987 Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Groovy had swept through an unbeaten season in New York so impressively he was 
being touted as a horse-of-the-year candidate. Nobody could get close to him. 
Speed handicappers said he was a Secretariat of sprinters. But then he came 
west for the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park, where the filly Very Subtle had 
no difficulty outrunning him for the lead and then beat him decisively. Groovy 
had been cruising to the lead at a relatively slow pace in the East, but now he 
had learned what West Coast speed is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Racing fans in California have a special fondness for those horses that emerge 
from the tough competition as the fastest of the fastest. Just as Easterners 
might ardently debate the merits of classic runners like Affirmed and Alydar, 
Westerners may argue who was the quickest of the great speedsters they have 
seen here -- horses like Chinook Pass, Phone Trick, Zany Tactics and Cherry 
River, for whom a half mile in :44 would be like a canter in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The latest in this great tradition of California speedballs is Olympic 
Prospect. He is modestly bred and started out in $50,000 claiming company, 
where Sadler bought him. He has had an assortment of knee problems. He has 
little stamina and no versatility. But he has more raw speed than any other 
thoroughbred in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I claimed him and put the blinkers on him," Sadler said, "nobody's ever 
been in front of him in the first quarter-mile. The most amazing race he's ever 
run was his first race at Santa Anita last year, when he went the first half 
mile in :43 flat. I've never seen that before. But he's run as fast as he has 
without catching a really fast, fast track." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect needed all his speed in the Crosby, which brought together the 
strongest field of sprinters in the country this year. On The Line had equaled 
Santa Anita's six-furlong record of 1:07 3/5 during the winter and had 
subsequently won the Carter Handicap in New York. Sam Who had won five sprint 
races in a row, twice running six furlongs in 1:08. 
</P>
<P>
When the gate opened, it was an aptly named long shot, Speedratic, who exploded 
out first. His jockey, Pat Valenzuela, is widely regarded as the best gate 
rider in America, one who habitually gets the jump. But after a couple of 
strides, Olympic Prospect was in high gear and he quickly opened a three-length 
lead. His time for the first quarter-mile was 21 2/5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
On The Line was chasing the leader, Gary Stevens urging him steadily so Olympic 
Prospect wouldn't get too far away. On the turn, he accelerated sharply. The 
Teletimer flashed a number Eastern racing fans will rarely see: 43 4/5 seconds 
for the half mile. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect was finished. As he weakened, On The Line opened a commanding 
lead in mid-stretch and scored a five-length victory over Speedratic. The final 
time for six furlongs was 1:08 flat. On The Line had established himself as the 
best sprinter in the West, in America, the horse to beat in the $1 million 
Breeders' Cup Sprint in the fall. He will next display his speed for Del Mar 
fans in the $75,000 Pat O'Brien Stakes over seven furlongs next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
California has plenty of memorable attractions for a tourist -- vistas on the 
Pacific, Peking-duck pizzas -- but what could be more breathtaking than to see 
a half mile in 43 4/5 and six furlongs in 1:08?

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HomeFed Corp., parent of Home Federal Savings in San Diego, said it has 
approved a shareholder rights plan designed to make it more expensive for any 
hostile suitors to take it over. The measure would be triggered when a suitor 
buys a stake of 15% or more. 
</P>
<P>
The rights will be issued on the basis of one right for each outstanding share 
of common stock owned by shareholders of record on Sept. 5. If a person or 
group acquires 15% or more of HomeFed shares, all shareholders other than the 
acquiring entity will have the right to purchase newly issued HomeFed shares at 
half price, diluting the value of the acquirer's stock. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed described the plan as a way of forcing those contemplating a takeover 
to negotiate directly with the board or face "an extremely costly and risky 
situation," HomeFed Chairman Kim Fletcher said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan will not prevent a takeover of the company," Fletcher said. "Rather, 
it will allow the board to negotiate a transaction that will be fair and in the 
best interest of all shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
The rights plan was not adopted in response to any specific effort to gain 
control of HomeFed, and the company's board is not aware of any such effort, 
Fletcher added. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Savings in Los Angeles separately announced a similar measure on 
Thursday.

BELUSHI'S 'WIRED' RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't know. You don't know what it's like to be me. -- John Belushi 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone know? Any time? In "Wired" (citywide), a movie based, very roughly, 
on Bob Woodward's book on the meteoric career and drug-overdose death of John 
Belushi, the film makers try for a multileveled hipster expose: a whacked-out 
docudrama, "Citizen Kane" squeezed through "Saturday Night Live" and basted 
with National Lampoon blood and bile. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Woodward, who projected little or zero simpatico for his subject, 
scenarist Earl Mac Rauch and director Larry Peerce are obviously trying to make 
the kind of movie Belushi himself might have had fun doing. They want to pump 
it full of his trademarks: the kamikaze humor, calculated outrage, show-biz 
in-jokes and explosive honesty. But it's too weird a task, too black a show. 
When they try to jam in sentiment and uplift, "Wired" starts overloading, 
blowing its circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Saturday Night Live," the movie jokes about death, kids or impersonates 
the famous, zips back and forth from sketch to sketch, throws in a rock act, 
winks and leers and then tries to slug us with a little heart. It begins with 
rapid, sock-in-the-eye juxtapositions: Belushi (Michael Chiklis) in his hated 
bee outfit, an off-screen conversation on casting him in "Wired" ("No man, he's 
dead!"), and then Belushi mysteriously revived and sweating from the morgue. 
Outside, he hails Ray Sharkey as Angel Velasquez, a Puerto Rican cabbie and 
fellow overdose victim: a cross between a junkie philosopher and Clarence the 
Guardian Angel in "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
It's Angel's job, apparently, to show the increasingly freaked-out John where 
he went wrong. He spins his rider quickly through TV success; the chaotic, 
high-stakes atmosphere of his movies; his home life with wife Judy (Lucinda 
Jenney, a fine job) and his on-the-road antics with best buddy and comic 
partner Dan Aykroyd (Gary Groomes, another fine job). 
</P>
<P>
This grisly cab ride is also interspersed with the dour investigations of the 
movie's Bob Woodward (J. T. Walsh), a just-the-facts-ma'am journalist put on 
the case by Judy to uncover the whole truth. Woodward, Angel and Belushi, in 
his morgue robe, all zip in and out of the same reality planes -- occasionally, 
some of them hail the others on the street -- and the movie skitters restlessly 
through scenes re-created from Woodward's book as well as imaginary "Saturday 
Night Live" routines and grotesque fantasies, erupting like paranoid flip-outs 
through the joked-up docudrama. 
</P>
<P>
It's a last-gasp, punch-you-in-the-ribs, anything-for-a-laugh-or-sob movie -- 
and it tries to punch things up to the same quasi-cocaine energy level that 
characterized a lot of '70s show-biz and movie humor. But there's a difference. 
In the crack-ravaged, freebase-plagued '80s, this tune hits sourer notes -- 
though the movie's oddball edge, slopped up with soap-opera twinges, plays less 
like a cautionary drug tale than a punked-out Remembrance of Flings Past. 
</P>
<P>
Now the movie's Belushi, instead of slamming fate's door with a coke-and-heroin 
speedball administered by scruffy death angel Cathy Smith (a scarily low-key 
performance by Patti D'Arbanville), seems doomed far earlier. The movie has a 
schizoid, lurching drive. It's about death's wild ride -- playing out your 
string, dancing over the edge -- and also about sweet vulnerable, lovable John, 
wasted by his appetites. 
</P>
<P>
Chiklis, the 25-year-old unknown who plays Belushi, captures this duality very 
well. He gives an intensely empathetic performance -- awash in sweat, rage and 
desperation -- that subtly suggests the real Belushi and elevates him to myth. 
Chiklis doesn't have Belushi's waggling eyebrows, but he gets the mix of 
machismo and delicacy. His skin looks transparent, bruisable: the skin of a 
corpse, an addict, a victim. 
</P>
<P>
Chiklis also gets Belushi's maniacal spontaneity. Playing against Sharkey's 
stylized Angel -- a cold-eyed, wised-up spritzer who turns all his y's 
defiantly into j's ("So what jou want?") -- he has the look of a man lowered 
over the flames. Playing against Groomes' warm, sloppy-grinning Aykroyd, he has 
a tender camaraderie. (This is the relationship that should have been caught in 
the actual Belushi-and-Aykroyd movies.) In the book, Belushi was trapped in the 
terse, white sidewalks of Woodward's prose, the police-blotter flatness and 
austerity. Here Rauch and Peerce let him answer Woodward's "You did it to 
yourself, John." The dying face blazes out, with a cop-hater's contempt. Even 
his sweat-drops seem accusatory. 
</P>
<P>
Reading Woodward's book, you might have expected the movie to be a "Lost 
Weekend" on uppers. But Rauch, who also co-wrote "New York, New York" and 
"Buckaroo Banzai," tries to take it further with this intricate, double-chase 
structure: Woodward and Belushi careening toward each other over the messy 
terrain of his life. He gets points for audacity and cleverness, and director 
Larry Peerce some for emotion. But the movie keeps pulling up short. 
</P>
<P>
The names are changed: John Landis turns into an anonymous manic beanpole of a 
director; Belushi manager Bernie Brillstein and assistant Joel Briskin are 
renamed. And Belushi's super-agent, Michael Ovitz, disappears completely, like 
God, somewhere above the unseen skyline. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a tendency to reject "Wired" on the simplest grounds. (That isn't 
John! That isn't Danny!) But the crippling flaw in the film lies in its mix of 
surface daring and inner funk. Inside, it keeps flinching. What the film never 
suggests -- what Woodward barely suggests either -- is that two addictions may 
have been involved in Belushi's destruction: one to cocaine; one, by others, to 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Belushi, like many media rebels, began as an outlaw and ended as a commodity -- 
a tormented commodity. That's part of the story "Wired" (MPAA-rated R for drug 
use, sex and language) misses: the addictions of commerce. Shouldn't the deal 
always be secondary to the work, the image to the man, the business to the 
audience, the per diem to carpe diem? 
</P>
<P>
You would think John Belushi, who worshiped the instant, would never have 
gotten trapped in the concrete of his own image. You would think the movie of 
his life would never get shot up with tricks and evasion. And you would think a 
great clown would never let a deal or a ruined deal -- or a high -- seal him 
off forever from the people who wanted to laugh with him. 
</P>
<P>
But . . . nooooooooooooo.

Symphony's SummerPops on Wednesday night at Hospitality Point. He reminisced 
about his musical contacts with Cole Porter and Charlie Chaplin, touted his 
favorite neglected composers (Victor Herbert in particular), put down 
television and Muzak, and admitted that he would rather have been at home in 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the road 150 years," he sighed to the audience, which, in spite 
of the implied slight, was charmed by his manner and his evident affection for 
the music he had programmed. In addition to the Porter tributes -- including 
suites from "Kiss Me Kate" (1948) and "Can Can" (1954) -- Henderson selected 
many of his own arrangements of music from the era of the radio and motion 
picture studio orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
While this oeuvre is neither thought-provoking nor particularly exciting, it 
uses the orchestra in a sophisticated manner. Henderson's effulgent arrangement 
of Debussy's "Claire de Lune" probably would have made the composer blush, 
although it is an instrumental tour de force. Eric Knight's "A Tribute to 
Charlie Chaplin" deftly distributed the solos around the orchestra and indulged 
in a generous catalogue of lush instrumental combinations. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's response to Henderson was alert and energetic, although the 
violins never seemed to give him that lush studio orchestra wash of sound he 
frequently requested. If Henderson's conducting style appeared ungainly and 
naive, he was nevertheless on top of his scores. He also played a few riffs on 
the piano with the orchestra, and he threw in a sympathetic solo rendition of 
Porter's "Blue Boy Blues" for good measure. Andre Watts does not have to begin 
practicing overtime because of Henderson's keyboard prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the irony of this neatly packaged Porter tribute was the absence of a 
vocalist to sing those incomparable Porter lyrics. The eager listener was 
taunted trying to remember all the wonderful words to the likes of "So In 
Love," "It's All Right With Me" and "Anything Goes." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's crowd was a respectable 2,789. The evening was made more enjoyable 
by an unexpected temporary closing of Lindbergh Field during most of the 
concert; it made the sky overhead friendlier, and much quieter. This Cole 
Porter program repeats tonight and Saturday at Hospitality Point.

Las Vegas musicians on strike over the planned decrease of live music in casino 
entertainment in favor of taped performances have picked up the support of Mike 
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 
Greene is going to Las Vegas today to meet with the musicians picketing five 
major resorts on the Strip and hold a press conference in front of Caesars 
Palace. "Obviously we support recorded music and technology," Greene said 
Thursday. "But more important is the well-being of musicians everywhere."

NOSTALGIA NIGHT AT BOWL TRIBUTE

Nostalgia hung like dew in the August air Wednesday at the Hollywood Bowl, 
where a crowd of swing fans paid tribute to music that was itself tributary. 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Walt Levinsky and the Great American Swing Band saluted the Benny 
Goodman orchestra; Nancy Wilson dedicated her set to Cannonball Adderley. Buddy 
de Franco and Terry Gibbs paid homage to Goodman's small group sound with 
"Airmail Special"; then there was Mel Torme's tribute to Mel Torme. 
</P>
<P>
Even Torme closed his set by playing Gene Krupa's original drums, backed by 
Levinsky and the band in "Sing Sing Sing," vintage 1938, followed by a 
free-for-all blues with Gibbs and Torme on vibes, Levinsky and De Franco on 
clarinet. (The contrast afforded by the latter's strong, compelling sound was 
striking.) 
</P>
<P>
Torme's set, for which he was backed mainly by an 11-piece ensemble with 
estimable Marty Paich arrangements, was a delight from top to bottom. Looking 
good for his 13th year at the Bowl, he was introduced by Harry Anderson. As 
always, he showed the same taste in his choice of material as in his 
interpretations, from a beautiful 1941 Harold Arlen melody, "When the Sun Comes 
Up," to a witty piece by Donald Fagen, "The Goodbye Look." 
</P>
<P>
Levinsky never quite captured the Goodman sound himself (he seemed most at ease 
when simply playing Levinsky style, backed by rhythm only, on "Here's That 
Rainy Day"). The band read the charts well, but the magic sense of swing stayed 
hidden. Two superior Mel Powell originals, "Clarinade" and "Mission to Moscow," 
were played just fast enough to lose the groove. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wilson sang songs from an album she made with Adderley in 1961. Except 
for an opening medley (arranged by Jeff Clayton, who played the Cannonball role 
on alto), the quintet had no chance to re-create the old Adderley sound, though 
with Oscar Brashear on trumpet and Adderley's original drummer, Roy McCurdy, it 
could and should have done a set of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson started well, but on reaching "The Masquerade Is Over" she began 
mangling the song (and wound up strangling it) with an irritating 
whisper-to-a-shriek dynamic contrast. What is sad is not just that she sings so 
badly, but that over the years such a promising artist lost her way. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs and De Franco were in fine fettle, particularly on the ballads. LEONARD

When Edward Hopper died in 1967, he left his estate to his wife, Jo, the model 
for many of the women in his paintings. Upon her death, Hopper's works went to 
the Whitney Museum of American Art. But the curators who came to collect them 
inadvertently left behind about 100 drawings -- a serendipity for Hopper's 
neighbor, who inherited the house and its contents. They make up part of the 
present exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were sketches Hopper made during the last few decades of his life -- 
records of ideas pondered, revised and thrown away in the process of planning 
his paintings. The most interesting studies show how the spatial treatment of a 
painting evolved, strengthening the relationship of the figures to each other 
and organizing the great empty spaces of architecture that enclose or buttress 
these lonely souls. 
</P>
<P>
"High Noon" (1949) is a painting of a blond woman in a provocative open gown 
who stands in the doorway of a blindingly white house. The demure garment she 
clutches in a preliminary charcoal figure study, however, would pass muster at 
a tea party. A rough crayon sketch shows the house cluttered with extraneous 
windows and not quite pulled around to its ultimate, commanding position within 
the rectangle of the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
In a study for "Summer in the City" (1949), the mood of torpid stillness and 
brooding wakefulness awaits further refinements in the composition. Hopper is 
still working out the position of a man sleeping nude, and a woman sitting on 
the edge of the bed hasn't yet crossed her arms. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies were direct observations -- like the sketch of Jo leaning forward 
with her weight on her hands, which would become the image of a woman peering 
intently out of a bay window in "Cape Cod Morning" (1950). Others, like 10 
drawings of scudding sailboats for "The Lee Shore" (1941), were remembered 
images that Hopper drew in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest sheets on view (from another private collection) are pencil 
drawings from the nude that Hopper made as an art student in his late teens and 
early 20s. The striking thing about some of these sketches is not so much 
Hopper's facility in academic drawing but the way he finds personality revealed 
by posture. In the paintings, the fussy details drop out, leaving the evocative 
power of stance and gesture. (Louis Newman Gallery, 322 N. Beverly Drive, to 
Sept. 18.) CATHY CURTIS

A brilliant colorist who reworked seashore and countryside into lyrically 
abstracted images, Milton Avery was generally less successful when he dealt 
with the figure. In a group of works on paper, images of thunder-thighed, 
round-bellied nudes with angular faces from the '40s and '50s don't make a good 
case for Avery's insights into female form. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the figurative works from the '30s have a more searching, idiosyncratic 
quality. "Bather," an angular, clay-colored giant with a fall of black hair, is 
somewhat reminiscent of Picasso's nudes of the '20s but with vivid snatches of 
landscape tucked around her anatomy. The high-shouldered, tight-knuckled child 
in a blue dress in "Little Girl" -- probably a portrait of his daughter March 
-- radiates a preternatural tension. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a chunk of nature, with or without people, to throw Avery into high 
gear. It would be hard to top the watercolor "Spring Field" (1939) for sheer 
delirium, with its riot of watermelon green, faded red and yellow wedges shot 
through with scribbled, skittering black lines. In "Sea Watcher," a massive 
fellow lying under a blanket ponders a calligraphic ruffle of foam edging the 
deep green and black sea. 
</P>
<P>
The sole painting in the show, "Sketcher of Skulls" (1947), is unusual in 
Avery's oeuvre. A Matissean richness of color drenches this interior scene in 
which an seated figure with a flat red face and curlicue hair sketches two 
bright yellow skulls on a blue table. Like radioactive deposits, the skulls 
irradiate the spare room with energy disproportionate to their small size.

Four artists using photography to jump into conceptual concerns makes for a 
generally quiet show, but there are some fascinating flashes. Pyrotechnics are 
provided by Alan Rath's mechanized, video screen contraptions -- raw technology 
tamed by wit. Like Nam June Paik's elaborate video presentations, they join 
high-tech film work to castoff television sets. Rath uses still photographs 
manipulated by computer on small video monitors that appear to have been ripped 
from larger systems. Rath's sculptures tend to leave all the technology 
exposed. This physical rawness is abetted by the rudimentary simplicity of 
flickering images which meld parts of the human body into the media system. 
With wit and irony they achieve a parody of humanity where desires, religion 
and economics have all gone robotic. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the show doesn't have as much flair. Richard Rothman's stark black 
and white photo montage images of flowers -- some silk, some real -- are 
strangely mute. Sokhi Wagner's three-dimensional photographs turn the photo 
into an curling object instead of a flat surface. They just don't have much 
else to offer besides their conceptual twist. 
</P>
<P>
There's so much going on in Charles Gaines' large plexiglass grid paintings of 
photographed trees that the viewer is left spinning. Compositions are overlaid 
with a systematized layer of colors in tiny numbered daubs, joining multiple 
trees into one seasonless, eternal tree buried in the work. Explanations and 
meaning are frustrated by a private code that generates even more questions. 
For such a dense layering of time and energy the results are oddly cryptic.

Treating paper like a soft sponge and pencil grid lines like a call to order, 
Ed Moses' newest gouache paintings are intriguing bits of happenstance and 
control. Rice paper flecked with pieces of bark make a light, absorbent ground 
that gives dark paint an earthy aura sparked by occasional bursts of 
flourescent pink. 
</P>
<P>
The poetry of these paintings is in the small puddles, leaks and color 
separations that happen as paper repeatedly absorbs calligraphic touches of 
paint. Yet the potency of the image doesn't come entirely from the 
uncontollable chance events. Rather they work because the softness of the 
liquid decomposes the underlying grid structure in an fluid, organic mass. It's 
a particularly Zen system of checks and balances that allows paint to suggest a 
fertile humus without turning the system into sodden mud. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are Tony Berlant's newest found metal collage panels. Increasingly 
busy, his shiny, color rich surfaces still mix figuration and abstraction in 
lush landscapes that occasionally lose themselves in their own complexity of 
line and form. 
</P>
<P>
Something excitingly different is going on in "The Last Moment," a wild, 
two-panel, bull's eye of circles and stripes pieced together with metal sign 
fragments bearing photo imagery. Like a huge, late night TV test pattern 
splattered with pieces of recognizable fruits and animals from defunct shows, 
the piece bulges into three dimensions as a seed pod pops into real space. More 
than the allusion to deep space or archaeological time that comes from the 
other collages, this piece seems to want to talk in everyday language about 
what is and isn't real. (L.A. Louver, 77 Market St. and 55 N. Venice Blvd., to

JAPANESE SUBTLETY: A TASTE AS SMOOTH AS SILK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to be sold on Japanese food. I can see the subtlety of it, all right -- 
the problem is, I'm afraid I see too much subtlety, an unsubtle degree of 
subtlety. The palette of flavors is so subdued that in paranoid moments I've 
suspected the whole thing of being a con job: the emperor's nouvelle cuisine, 
as it were, which can only be tasted by the pure in heart. 
</P>
<P>
I'd as soon be in the cheering section, though. And I certainly admire the 
precision and lyricism that Japanese chefs, such as Tomihisa Hasare of Cafe 
Blanc, bring to French cooking. So when Hasare opened a Japanese restaurant 
called Silk, I decided to address my doubts. 
</P>
<P>
Silk calls itself "A Sushi Bar And!" and there are a few unusual things buried 
in this short menu, so I took along a Japanese friend and two knowledgeable 
Nipponophiles to light the way. And anyway, it's more comfortable to have a 
crowd with you on this exceedingly Hollywood-colorful block of Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sushi bar at Silk, of course, but most of the menu offers cooked 
dishes. The chicken teriyaki, for instance, is something that could show up 
without comment at Cafe Blanc: a nearly boneless half-chicken, grilled, sliced 
and served on top of a hidden bed of spaghetti. The chicken juices and teriyaki 
sauce are exceptionally sweet and pleasant, and on the side one finds not only 
rice but chunks of carrot and broccoli in a pleasant cream sauce. It comes with 
a little bit of bland Japanese soup and a great little salad in, I guess, 
ginger-miso vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of dishes served the same way, cuddling a bit of spaghetti, come in 
ponzu, a lemony sauce of finely minced vegetables, mostly sweet peppers and 
carrot. My Japanese guest said there was some bitterness in the sauce. True, it 
was as if there were Korean pickled cabbage in the mix. It did not stop me from 
eating the wonderful salmon, though. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody liked the agedashi, chunks of tofu dipped in sesame seed and deep 
fried. They came out with a beautiful custardlike texture, and if I ever have 
to eat a lot of tofu, I hope it's all agedashi. There were some appetizerish 
things on skewers, such as beef (which had not been subjected to any 
tenderizer, I can distinctly affirm) and giant clam (pleasantly chewy). 
Isobeage is a little unusual: bits of fish wrapped in shiso leaf and deep 
fried. The shiso leaf seemed there mostly to provide a handle for the fish, if 
one wasn't using chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
Even avoiding the sushi stuff, though, there were still a number of dishes I 
couldn't work up the slightest enthusiasm for. Onagiri is still onagiri, even 
at Silk: rather filling wedges of sticky rice mixed with the tiniest bits of 
salmon and half-wrapped in seaweed. Hiyayakko is extremely bland cold tofu, a 
dish served in the summer, so I'm told. A substitute for an ice cube, then. OK, 
I can accept that, though I'd usually prefer the ice cube. 
</P>
<P>
And finally an extremely authentic Japanese dish, a working-class snack, as I 
understand it: chazuke. To wit -- rice, salmon and spinach with a lot of green 
tea poured over it. It struck me as a table accident that had been elevated 
into a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
One of the desserts was pretty good, though. The cheesecake had a lot of 
character, and it came in fresh strawberry sauce. You could also get fresh 
fruit, cut with the never-failing Japanese eye for beauty. 
</P>
<P>
My guests were a little defensive. Japanese food is much better in Japan, they 
insisted; can't get the right ingredients here, the usual ethnic food problems. 
I'll take their word. And I'll say Silk is pretty good for a California 
Japanese restaurant. And I'll still prefer Cafe Blanc.

JIMMY CLIFF HANGING ON THE VERGE OF VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Cliff, headlining the Palace on Tuesday, found a novel way around his 
perennial dilemma of dealing with an audience primed to hear the hits from "The 
Harder They Come." He did sing three tunes from the 1972 movie that made him 
reggae's first international star, but two of them -- "By the Rivers of 
Babylon" and "Johnny Too Bad" -- were Jamaican hits for other artists. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff is currently without an American label, and his nearly two-hour set 
before a half-filled house on the first of his two nights at the Palace didn't 
seem likely to change that situation. After an effective opening medley that 
found Cliff backed only by keyboards, bass and bongos, the arrangements became 
a hodgepodge of mismatched elements while the lyrics tackled serious subjects 
in puerile, programmatic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff's athletic stage presence was initially appealing, but his performance 
progressively took on the something-for-everyone cast of a reggae artist headed 
for a Vegas-style nightclub circuit. The high point was the audience's 
unprompted reply to Cliff's melismatic wailing at the end of one song. Cliff 
seemed genuinely surprised at the response -- it was one of those rare moments 
of uncontrived audience participation that so many performers strive to achieve 
with tired routines. 
</P>

The Austin, Tex.-based quintet I-Tex opened with a set displaying solid 
musicianship, little charisma and enough savvy to play off the irony of a band 
that looks like country outlaws playing Jamaican-inspired music.DON SNOWDEN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SOMETHING DISTINCTLY NEW YORK ABOUT BRIGHTON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You probably don't know what scungilli is. Unless, of course, you happen to 
come from New York. And if you come from New York, you'll instantly recognize 
that there is something familiar about Brighton's, 7226 Melrose Ave., (213) 
937-2801. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than the accents of the owners. It's the menu, with its scungilli, 
its baked clams oreganata, its linguine with clams and its Manhattan chowder. 
Should you not be in the mood for seafood, Brighton's also serves big plates of 
pork chops and chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The TV in the bar is tuned to the baseball game. The portions are large and the 
prices reasonable. But although Brighton's feels like Archie Bunker territory, 
there are lots of things to remind you that you're in California. There's the 
pole wrapped up in black-and-white fabric. There's the rug. There's the woman 
at the bar with the spandex pants and leather jacket and bleached-blond hair. 
There's the guy on the skateboard who wanders in off Melrose to ask the way to 
Orange Street. 
</P>
<P>
Pay them no mind. Order another half-dozen clams on the half shell. Have 
another martini. Think of Brighton Beach, and drink a toast to the Big Apple.

PACIFIC ENSEMBLE'S 'WIVES OF WINDSOR' LACKS MERRIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>

"Let them keep their limbs whole and hack our English," says Sir Hugh Evans 
(Jim Marilley) in "The Merry Wives of Windsor." Pardon me, but was he talking 
to the members of the Pacific Theatre Ensemble? In the name of making merry 
with the "Merry Wives," the ensemble creates mayhem. Some of it works, much of 
it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
This is another concept Shakespeare and potentially a good one, too: A 
contemporary "Merry Wives" set in Venice, Calif., a stone's throw from the tip 
of the Santa Monica Pier where this production takes place. Falstaff (Robert 
Evan Collins) is a rogue and a beach bum. Pistol's a black dude; Nym's a 
Chicano. But like so many other concepts, this one goes too far and not far 
enough. It suffers from a certain timidity, as if something impelled director 
D. Paul Yeuell to stop just short of letting the production bounce off the 
boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
In an ebullient, windblown setting such as this, it's imperative to let things 
rip. Excess is easier to forgive than shyness. The place is noisy but 
life-affirming. There's a ready, appreciative audience among the gazers, 
fishermen, lovers, children and grandparents out for a weekend stroll. The free 
show's 250 chairs are quickly filled, even if not always with the same bodies. 
But the coming and going in the course of a performance seems to bother no one 
and there are always other bodies looking on, ready to plop into an empty seat. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, then, this is Shakespeare painted in beach colors: pink, purple, 
orange, aqua, yellow and lime green. Thomas Buderwitz did the modest unit set 
that includes corrugated sheeting and Cyclone fencing among its fanciful 
materials. Andrew Gordon has composed (and performs) music and songs with 
lyrics by "D.P. Yeuell and Wm. Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
None of the songs are listed by title, but titles can be easily arranged: A 
"Bride's Lament" for the unhappy Ann Page (a charmless Lisa Steele); a 
"Husband's Lament" for the unhappy Frank Ford (Robert Jacobs in the 
production's best show of farce); a rap song by Nym (Ruben Amavizca) and Pistol 
(James Tyrone Wallace II) -- and a women's chorus to a reggae beat that engages 
Mistresses Page (Del Appleby), Ford (Synthia L. Hardy) and Quickly (Melissa 
Weber, the event's sexiest entry in spiraling beehive, garter belt and merry 
widow -- a puzzling get-up even for Venice, but probably costumer Rhonda 
Earick's private joke). 
</P>
<P>
It is this kind of left turn that, while amusing in itself, derails logic and 
keeps the play from benefitting from conceptual follow-through. Lines like 
George Page's "Come gentlemen, we have grilled mahi-mahi to dinner" or Mistress 
Page's "Your husband's coming hither with all the big shots in Windsor" or 
Falstaff's answer to Brook's "How did it go?" ("A bummer, man") lose their bite 
for being so arbitrarily forced into their context. Talk of "smackers," "limos" 
and "producers" has the same effect: funny for a moment but not sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the show's most accomplished performance comes from Frank Collison as 
the witless Slender, reluctant suitor to Ann Page, not only because he is an 
actors' actor who understands character, but because he is called upon to 
transgress period the least. 
</P>
<P>
David Nathan has fun with Simple, which he performs in a Marxist vein -- Harpo 
Marx, that is, with whistle, kazoo, goggles, a flying ace cap on his head and 
no words. But Loren Lester's Dr. Caius speaks with such a fractured French 
accent, that it is virtually impossible to follow what he's up to. For the rest 
of the actors, they provide energetic, serviceable performances. (This is not a 
company of second-raters.) Next to Collison, however, only Jacobs in the dual 
role of Ford and Brook really understands how to go about this kind of 
broadness. 
</P>
<P>
So one is both grateful for this first co-venture between the City of Santa 
Monica and the Ensemble and aware that it still needs some fine-tuning. Aside 
from the development of a show with more of a sense of its own final 
destination, there are more pragmatic matters to be taken care of, such as the 
placement of a banner at the entrance to the pier to let people know there is a 
play about to take place at the other end. And when the actors emerge from 
their improvised dressing rooms and walk past the audience to the stage, let it 
be not a walk (as it is now) but a slam-bang parade. 
</P>
<P>
A little well-placed panache (and city assistance) never hurts. 
</P>

 On the west end of the Santa Monica Pier, Fridays, 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. 
and 2 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Until Sept. 10. Free; (213) 306-3943.

A U.S. magistrate in Boston ordered that fugitive financier George Koskotas be 
extradited to Greece to face charges of embezzling more than $200 million from 
the Bank of Crete. Magistrate Joyce Alexander rejected Koskotas' arguments that 
he would face possible assassination if returned to his homeland and that the 
charges are political, a category of offense that is not extraditable under a 
U.S.-Greek treaty. She also said that Koskotas, 35, raised no defense to bar 
his extradition. Koskotas is at the center of a financial scandal that brought 
down the government of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in May.

A Sacramento-area Scoutmaster whose volunteer work earned him his community's 
"Citizen of the Year" award in 1988 has been sentenced to 10 years in state 
prison for molesting nine boys. Allen Lee Trueman, 42, had pleaded guilty to 
nine molestation counts in a plea bargain that had called for a maximum 
eight-year sentence. But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Jack Sapunor rejected 
the agreement, noting that Trueman's acts had "horrendous" effects on his 8- to 
14-year-old victims. Five of the boys are in counseling, one has been placed in 
a residential mental facility for evaluation, and at least one of the victims 
has withdrawn from men in general, including his own father, according to court 
documents.

Israeli soldiers conducted house-to-house searches and maintained curfews in 
the northwestern West Bank in an effort to find an Israeli who was abducted by 
two masked men wielding axes and knives. The military closed off the West Bank 
town of Tulkarm and surrounding villages as it searched for Shaul Mishani, 45, 
a gold dealer from Bat Yam. Mishani disappeared while collecting debts owed to 
him by Tulkarm gold dealers, Army Radio reported. It is not clear whether the 
abduction was politically motivated.

Leona Helmsley's lawyer, ending an impassioned 8 1/2-hour defense of his rich 
and famous client in Manhattan federal court, implored the jury "to end the 
long, terrible suffering of Mrs. Helmsley" by acquitting her of tax evasion, 
conspiracy and extortion charges. Gerald A. Feffer painted Helmsley, 69, as the 
victim of government witnesses with axes to grind -- many of them former 
employees that the billionaire hotelier had fired. Feffer sought to rebut 
testimony presented on the extortion charge, the most serious leveled in the 
case, which carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.

PAC BELL WINS ON DIAL-PORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell is one step closer to pulling the plug on so-called "dial-a-porn" 
telephone services after a favorable ruling in federal court, a company 
spokeswoman said. A federal judge in Washington ruled that Pacific Bell, as a 
private business, has the right to disconnect dial-a-porn services under 
federal laws. However, the utility must now determine if it has the same rights 
under state laws and filed a suit in San Francisco Superior Court, naming 13 
dial-a-porn companies as defendants. Past efforts to ban dial-a-porn services 
have been blocked by First Amendment guarantees of free speech. "As a private 
business, Pac Bell should have the right to choose who we want and don't want 
to do business with," Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said.

About 50 South Korean protesters assaulted a U.S. Air Force sergeant in a 
provincial courtroom where he is on trial for the death of a Korean national. 
In a statement, Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, the senior U.S. commander, denounced 
the "mob attack" on Tech. Sgt. Bruce D. Harayda that took place Tuesday at the 
Chonju District Court, 125 miles south of Seoul. Harayda, 29, and his Korean 
wife were treated for minor injuries. Harayda is on trial for manslaughter in 
the death of Chung Pan Yong, 53.

Club-wielding police attacked demonstrators in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, 
injuring dozens of them, to break up a protest marking the 50th anniversary of 
a secret Nazi-Soviet pact, activists said in Moscow, where a smaller 
demonstration was staged a few hours earlier. Parts of the western Ukraine as 
well as Moldavia and all three Baltic republics were annexed by Soviet dictator 
Josef Stalin under secret terms of his 1939 pact with Adolf Hitler on the eve 
of World War II. One of the Kiev activists said several thousand people were 
involved in the protest, waving yellow-and-blue Ukrainian national flags. 
Officials confirmed the demonstration but denied reports of arrests or 
injuries.

A blind man who prosecutors say entered a bank and robbed it of $950 was 
released into the custody of another blind man. San Francisco Municipal Judge 
Charles James ruled that 34-year-old ex-welder Richard Dunbar can remain free 
without bond during plea proceedings on charges of second-degree burglary and 
grand theft. Dunbar was arrested at the teller's window of a Bank of America 
branch earlier this month. He was released into the custody of 38-year-old 
William Douglas of Eureka. Dunbar declared at the time of the incident that he 
had become desperate because he was robbed of all of his Social Security money 
during a mugging. The judge ordered Dunbar back to court next month to enter a 
plea.

Grenada's government suspended Parliament amid opposition threats to bring 
Prime Minister Herbert Blaize down with a no-confidence vote. Blaize, who lost 
leadership of his New National Party, has been under intense pressure over what 
critics call an increasingly authoritarian style. The suspension means Blaize 
can govern without any parliamentary opposition until as late as February, a 
month before general elections are due. Opposition leader George Brizan accused 
Blaize, 71, of treating Parliament with "ridicule and contempt" during the 
Caribbean island's most serious political crisis since the 1983 revolution and 
subsequent U.S.-led invasion. Parliament is being suspended for an indefinite 
period.

Billionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley had trouble differentiating between the tax 
status of her husband's real estate empire and the couple's $11-million estate, 
her defense lawyer said in closing arguments in Manhattan federal court. 
Helmsley, 69, is accused of billing $4 million worth of renovations at the 
couple's mansion in Connecticut as business expenses in order to evade $1 
million in taxes. Harry Helmsley, her 80-year old real estate magnate husband, 
also was charged but was severed from the trial after a series of strokes left 
him with a loss of memory.

Tentative agreement on job security and work rules was announced at a second 
Bell Atlantic telephone company, and talks resumed at Ameritech, another of 
three Baby Bells tied up in an 18-state strike now in its third week. The 
settlement was reached between the union and Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone 
in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, but a 
spokesman said a walkout that began Aug. 6 will continue until agreements are 
reached at all sister Bell Atlantic companies. At NYNEX, which serves 10.5 
million customers in the Northeast, no new talks were scheduled between 
representatives of its 60,000 striking workers and the company.

A second Ethiopian rebel group said it has accepted former President Jimmy 
Carter's offer to act as an observer in peace talks with the Ethiopian 
government. The Tigre People's Liberation Front said it had chosen Carter so 
talks could start without delay. Earlier, the Eritrean People's Liberation 
Front, fighting in the adjacent province of Eritrea, agreed to talks in Atlanta 
beginning Sept. 7 on a solution to their 28-year-old insurgency.

COUNTY MILK BOARD MAY LOSE AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The obscure Los Angeles County Milk Commission, which regulates the production, 
distribution and sale of raw milk, is about to lose its low profile and 
possibly its job. 
</P>
<P>
A report due to come before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday says the 
commission has been more of an advocate than a watchdog for the lone company it 
regulates -- Stueve Brothers Farms, a Chino dairy in neighboring San Bernardino 
County. The report calls for the state, which currently regulates pasteurized 
milk, to take over the commission's duties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asks for Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon also recommended that the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission look into Commission Chairman Paul M. 
Fleiss' work as a paid consultant to an attorney for Stueve Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The report was ordered last May after a Bay Area judge called the six-member 
county panel a "captive" of Alta-Dena Dairies, a company formerly owned by 
Stueve Brothers. Alta-Dena no longer produces raw milk. Stueve Brothers Farms 
claims to be the state's largest raw milk dairy, producing 5,000 gallons a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Superior Court Judge John Sutter complained about the commission 
while ruling that Stueve Brothers was running a misleading advertising campaign 
touting the health benefits of raw milk. He noted that the commission relied on 
the lone company it regulates for financial support and warned that such a cozy 
relationship compromised the panel and weakened its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The dairy provides the commission with clerical help, including the typing of 
commission minutes, Dixon said, and the commission's budget, including travel, 
is paid for by the dairy. He said he does not know how large the budget is, nor 
how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 'Machinations' 
</P>
<P>
"The more I learned about the machinations of the commission, the more I 
understood the conclusions of the Bay Area judge," Dixon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, he wrote, "There are presently no established rules or 
regulations governing operations of the commission, or the manner by which the 
members are to be compensated." 
</P>
<P>
"This office found evidence that the Milk Commission has failed to uphold its 
standards for the certification of raw milk," Dixon wrote. He cited the 
transcript from last spring's court case in which "it was disclosed that raw 
milk with bacteria counts 10 times higher than the minimum standards" had been 
certified by the commission and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Fleiss, a pediatrician, was vacationing and could not be reached for comment. 
Last May, he said that he worked as a consultant for the attorney for the 
former Alta-Dena owners and reviewed medical literature and lawsuits filed 
against the company. But he said he did not think it was necessary to list his 
consulting job on his conflict-of-interest statement because the work did not 
involve any cases that came before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Impropriety' 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Stueve Brothers said Thursday, "There has been absolutely 
no impropriety."' 
</P>
<P>
In recommending that the commission's duties be taken over by the state, Dixon 
pointed out the commission was created in 1968 because the raw milk dairy was 
located in Los Angeles County. Today, the dairy and milk-producing herds are in 
San Bernardino County, and the raw milk is distributed statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert S. Neuenschwander, a commission member since 1983, insisted Thursday 
that he and his fellow members are independent. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't want any milk to be sold that will be unsafe to anybody," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cause of Concern 
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about Dixon's recommendation to turn over the job to the 
state. "Many people in Sacramento are very hostile to the concept of raw milk, 
and I think this would be a good way in their minds to stamp this business 
out."

WIDOW'S NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
MAN ONCE CONVICTED IN HER HUSBAND'S DEATH FILES $500,000 SUIT AGAINST HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Langlos has battled a reluctant bureaucracy, tangled with an unpredictable 
legal system and endured some bitter surprises ever since her husband's body 
was found in a blood-spattered Downey office in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office had determined that John T. Langlos, a 
52-year-old clinical psychologist, had died of a heart attack. But his widow 
waged a stubborn, six-year campaign to persuade authorities that, in fact, he 
was a murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
Her persistence was rewarded when Eugene Clarence Hartman was convicted in 1984 
of second-degree murder and sentenced to state prison. That triumph, however, 
was short-lived when Hartman was freed in 1985 because of a legal technicality. 
</P>
<P>
For Langlos, it was a painful conclusion, but it appeared her odyssey was over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back in Court 
</P>
<P>
Now, four years later, the 69-year-old Langlos finds herself back in court -- 
this time as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the very man once convicted of 
killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I am now the accused, and my husband was taken from me," an anguished Langlos 
said from her Huntington Beach home. "This just shows that the wheels of 
justice can backfire, and I didn't think that could happen in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Langlos, who underwent triple-bypass heart surgery last spring, said she was 
stunned several weeks ago when she received a court summons informing her that 
Hartman was suing for "malicious prosecution" and seeking $500,000 from her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was devastating. I just could not believe he wanted a half-million dollars 
from me," Langlos said. "I was shocked. It brought everything back, all the 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Those nightmarish memories stretch back to Feb. 2, 1976, when her husband's 
body was discovered wedged partly beneath an office desk. There was a gash in 
his head. Three buttons were torn from his shirt and his wallet and money clip 
were missing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cashed a Check 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Hartman, a psychologist who occasionally worked with Langlos 
at the clinic, was arrested by Oakland police after he cashed a check drawn on 
Langlos' account and used Langlos' credit card to buy a watch and airline 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Originally charged with murder, Hartman, 61, was released after a deputy 
medical examiner ruled that Langlos had died of natural causes. Authorities 
theorized that Langlos had suffered heart failure and fell, striking his head 
on his desk, and that Hartman had discovered and looted the body. Hartman was 
freed after serving 36 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ruth Langlos insisted that her husband had been murdered and embarked on 
her quest to prove county officials wrong. She spent $50,000 for independent 
autopsies that challenged the original county findings. But then-Coroner Thomas 
Noguchi refused to change the death certificate -- a required step before new 
murder charges could be filed against Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coroner's Jury Conclusion 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Langlos took her case to a coroner's jury, which concluded in May, 
1982, that her husband had died of "undetermined causes . . . at the hands of 
another." Less than a year later, the district attorney's office filed a new 
murder charge against Hartman, and in 1984, he was convicted of murdering John 
Langlos. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the state Court of Appeal overturned Hartman's conviction, ruling that 
he was denied due process because the lengthy delay between Langlos' death and 
the trial resulted in a loss of evidence. When the state Supreme Court later 
that year declined to consider a prosecution appeal, Hartman was permanently 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, who now lives in Sacramento, told The Times that he was the target of 
a politically motivated prosecution and filed his lawsuit to underscore his 
innocence of the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the case was so bizarre and there was so much media value and Mrs. 
Langlos kept pushing (for a conviction), that put me at a disadvantage," 
Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Although he filed the lawsuit in January, 1987, Hartman said he only notified 
Langlos this month because he could not determine where she lived until 
recently -- a fact that terrifies Langlos. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought now I can go on with my life, but I can't," she said. "He's stopped 
that, and now he knows where I am." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said Thursday he has no intention of harming Langlos, although he 
blames her for his conviction. In his lawsuit, he also named Gov. George 
Deukmejian, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, then-Dist. Atty. Robert H. 
Philibosian and several state and county officials as defendants and accused 
them of pursuing the case against him merely to "gain political advantage and 
to aid Ruth Langlos's campaign of harassment." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $500,000 claim against Langlos, Hartman is seeking $2 
million from the county and $500,000 from the state. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez on Thursday dismissed the 
state defendants from the case, ruling that as public officials they are immune 
from such civil lawsuits. The judge had earlier removed Philibosian and the 
county as defendants for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who filed the original case 
against Hartman, said the real victim remains Ruth Langlos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's atrocious. I don't think there is any merit to the lawsuit at 
all," Norris said. "The tragedy is that she has to respond and retain a lawyer. 
. . . It's a real system of injustices that needs to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Simon, an attorney with the Senior Citizens Legal Advocacy Program of the 
Legal Aid Society of Orange County, agreed and said his office has been asked 
to represent Langlos. "Mrs. Langlos has been through this for 13 long years," 
Simon said, "and it just seems to never end."

TANOREXIA; 
</P>
<P>
HAVING A GOLDEN TAN CAN BECOME A COMPULSION FOR SOME SALON PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A movie theater manager by day, a sun-machine worshiper by night, Bruce 
Landegent does not think of himself as a man obsessed. Still, he understands 
how it could happen -- how a person could get carried away in the quest for the 
perfect tan. 
</P>
<P>
"It would probably be hard for me to quit," Landegent said one recent evening 
in the lobby of a Westside tanning parlor, his burnished face newly reddened by 
a blast of ultraviolet rays. Landegent, who is 30, has a $50-per-month habit, 
tanning three or four nights each week for the last few years. "I know it's not 
good for you. But to me, it's worth it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If I miss a few days, I feel pale." 
</P>
<P>
The suntanning industry has a word for it: tanorexia. Like painfully thin 
anorexics who complain about being fat and go on diets, "people will come in 
and be just as dark as they can be -- and they'll say, 'Oh, I'm so white,' " 
explained Mark Brammeier, the surprisingly fair-skinned manager of the Le Beach 
Club salon that has Landegent as a member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger of Cancer 
</P>
<P>
Tanorexics, it is now well known, are excellent candidates for skin cancer. "A 
lot of my patients are the type of people who used to spend all their time out 
on the beach trying to get a tan," said Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist at UCLA 
Medical Center and a director of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
Tanning salon operators say they advise people not to overdo it -- but please 
do it indoors. Dermatologists, meanwhile, advise people not to do it, period, 
outdoors or in. The perfect tan, skin doctors suggest, is the one you were born 
with. 
</P>
<P>
This war has been raging for years now, and some dispatches from the front 
suggest that the palefaces are winning. The sale of sun block has rocketed. 
Vogue and other fashion magazines have declared pale to be "in." The California 
Legislature in January enacted a law that requires tanning salons to warn 
customers of the risks. Zonker Harris, the Doonesbury comic-strip character who 
had a passion for tanning, gave up his toasty look a few seasons back. "The 
California Tan May Go the Way of California Condor," overstated a Wall Street 
Journal headline. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the condor can't go the way of the tanning parlor. Only a decade after 
the first tanning salon opened in the United States, about 19,000 are in 
business across the country, industry representatives say. More than 100 
tanning shops operate in sunny Los Angeles, and a random survey suggests that 
business is good -- even in summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Shoddiness' 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people too busy to hit the beach or lie by the pool show up each 
day -- especially after sundown -- to places with names like Jiffy Tan, 
California Gold, Tan Your Hide, Tan It All, the Covina Beach Club (in the East 
San Gabriel Valley) and Manhattan Tan (as in Manhattan Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Business slows down when the real sun is high and the days are long, and scores 
of parlors have opened and quickly closed in recent years. "There's a lot of 
shoddiness in the business," one owner acknowledged. Suntan entrepreneurs say 
the market is stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
"People say the white look is in and suntan is out," said John Anderson, 
president of the Sun Days chain. "But look at major movies stars . . . Mel 
Gibson. Sylvester Stallone. They're always tan in the movies. . . . When all 
that publicity was hitting -- that the tan look was out -- it didn't affect our 
business at all. It really didn't." 
</P>
<P>
It was the best of tans, it was the worst of tans -- it was, in fact, Coco 
Chanel's tan that helped make tanning what it is today. For centuries, fashion 
historians report, a tan was the mark of the working classes. But in 1922, 
Chanel, the influential fashion designer, returned from a cruise wearing a 
darker hue, and a look was born. In time, sun-bronzed skin became a symbol of 
affluence -- of excess leisure time by the pool, on the beach, on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, increasing reports of skin cancer -- now up to 500,000 new 
cases each year in the United States -- prompted the American Academy of 
Dermatology to launch its anti-sunning campaign. Explanations for the increase 
range from the aging of baby-boomers to the depletion of the Earth's 
ultraviolet-filtering ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late Start in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial tanning business began booming in Southern California about the 
same time. The trend arrived late in Los Angeles for the obvious reason. "It 
seemed like selling ice to the Eskimos," said Brian Hebberling, co-owner of the 
Electric Sun chain. 
</P>
<P>
What ersatz sunshine merchants discovered were that many Southern Californians 
wanted a tan but couldn't find the time for the outdoors. Some salons cater to 
their busy clients by providing rooms with telephones, allowing them to conduct 
business while they brown. 
</P>
<P>
Although physicians generally condemn tanning machines as harmful, salon 
operators argue that current tanning machines are safer than natural sunlight 
because the machines emit fewer "burning" ultraviolet B rays and more of the 
"tanning" ultraviolet A rays. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, dermatologists say a tan is itself a sign of damaged skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess in an absolute world, they're correct," said Wayne Lavassar, owner of 
the Le Beach Club chain. "The case for getting a tan is that we look better and 
we feel better. And if we are going out of doors, it does provide protection 
from a painful burn. That is our body's natural defense against the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for indoor tanning is we can achieve that cosmetic benefit, and if 
we're sensible, we can get that benefit while minimizing the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the customer enters a private room, dons protective eye wear and 
lies on a plexiglass bed outfitted with light tubes. Sessions of no longer than 
30 minutes are recommended, and no more often than once every 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Range in Fees 
</P>
<P>
Fees range considerably. One popular club offered a four-month membership 
special with unlimited visits for $129. Another charges $9 per month, plus $1 
for every 10 minutes. By contrast, a parlor that uses expensive machines that 
offer only ultraviolet A rays charges $49 per month plus $10 per 30-minute 
session. 
</P>
<P>
For that price, one parlor guarantees a tan without a burn. But this type of 
tan produced by ultraviolet A rays provides no protection against the sunburn, 
so use of a sun block is also recommended. 
</P>
<P>
But Moy, the UCLA dermatologist, says the dangers of an intense dose of 
ultraviolet light -- be it A or B rays -- is unknown. Two decades ago, he 
points out, X-ray technology was used to treat cancer. Only years later did 
doctors determine that those treatments enhanced the chances of a person 
developing skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years from now, 20 years from now, I'm sure I'll be seeing people who went 
to these tanning parlors," Moy said. 
</P>
<P>
But at Le Beach Club, the customers just keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
One was Dr. Tom Wheeler, an ophthalmologist and plastic surgeon, who told how 
he turned his own sensitive skin from pale to brown with his own program of 
prescription medications, ointments and machine tanning. Another was 
hairdresser Aaron Solis, a pasty Englishman who told how he planned to impress 
friends arriving from London with his "California tan." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was 44-year-old Cheryl Schneider, who told the story of how her 
mother, a Palm Springs resident, had developed such a severe case of skin 
cancer that it affected her deep facial tissue. Surgery caused some 
disfigurement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider thinks a sun machine is safer than the real thing. But, she was 
asked, why tan at all? 
</P>
<P>
"The way I think, I'm going to go one way or another," Schneider said. "I feel 
better when I have a tan."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DWP WORKER FACES POLLUTION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Department of Water and Power supervisor was charged Thursday 
with causing a cloud of hazardous smoke last September at the city's 
Scattergood power plant in Playa del Rey when he allegedly ordered a worker to 
place paint cans and solvents in a furnace. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Hahn filed a two-count criminal complaint against Charles Ivan 
Ashbaugh, a 20-year DWP employee from Santa Ana who oversees environmental and 
safety coordination at the plant. He is accused of violating state laws that 
prohibit the illegal disposal of hazardous waste and the discharge of air 
contaminants that endanger public health. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said in a press release that Ashbaugh ordered a worker at the plant to 
place the hazardous wastes in a furnace that had been shut down for repairs. 
When the furnace was started, Hahn said, the waste burned and created a dense 
cloud of hazardous smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The two misdemeanor charges are each punishable by up to one year in jail and 
carry fines of up to $101,000. Ashbaugh, through a DWP spokesman, declined to 
comment on the charges.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAFETY RULES FOR ROADSIDE AID ASKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has called on auto clubs and other providers of 
emergency roadside services to establish new safety procedures to reduce the 
risk of attack for motorists waiting for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The action came in the wake of heavy lobbying by several dozen business women, 
civic and community leaders who asked the Automobile Club of Southern 
California and other service providers to set up better safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
The women said they were concerned that people had been attacked after their 
cars broke down and they were required to wait for help at telephone booths 
rather than in their locked cars. 
</P>
<P>
The motion by Council President John Ferraro also asked the city attorney to 
draw up an ordinance that would require tow truck operators to enhance their 
safety procedures as part of the city two-truck permit system. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's spokesman Bill Gilson said the city now lacks the power under state 
law to regulate the emergency roadside service providers and therefore the 
motion only requests the change.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN SEES CHANGE IN TRUCK-BAN FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden held a meeting of the council 
Transportation Committee Thursday to hear objections to rush-hour restrictions 
on truck traffic and said he believes those who oppose the plan will come to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are on the right track," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
More than a half-dozen speakers representing public agencies, private firms and 
associations voiced their concerns at a City Hall meeting held by Holden, 
chairman of the Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations included questions about the delivery of perishable products to 
grocery stores, the problems of violating noise ordinances at off-hours and the 
necessity of renegotiating labor contracts with unions representing truck 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Holden said he hopes truck-traffic restrictions, proposed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley about two years ago, can be adopted by the first of the year, 
if it can be done without "putting people out of business or causing them undue 
hardship." He said that he had never opposed the plan, despite recents reports 
in The Times that he had.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN COPTER ESCAPE TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man who hired a helicopter pilot in a failed attempt to fly his 
brother out of a federal prison in Florida pleaded guilty in Miami Wednesday to 
conspiracy charges in connection with the unsuccessful escape attempt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Kramer, 30, hired the pilot in April to fly into the exercise yard at the 
federal correctional center in Miami and pick up his brother, Benjamin Barry 
Kramer, who was awaiting trial on drug smuggling and money laundering charges, 
federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmate boarded the aircraft, but the helicopter crashed after its blades 
became entangled in a security fence as it tried to take off. Benjamin Kramer, 
who was injured in the crash, faces trial later this year on the escape 
charges, prosecutors said.

JIM MURRAY: SQUEEZED PLAY ENSURES HIS PLACE IN HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, never mind say-it-ain't-so. It's so. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose got an intentional base on balls. 
</P>
<P>
Or did he bunt? 
</P>
<P>
Bart Giamatti pitched around him. Put him on, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
It looks from the sidelines like the legal equivalent of both sides falling on 
the ball till the clock runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is saved. Pete Rose's niche in the Hall of Fame is secure because he 
didn't admit anything. In courtroom parlance, he pleaded nolo contendere. 
</P>
<P>
Pete says he gave himself up for the good of the team. Sort of like hitting 
behind the runner. His troubles were distracting attention from the great game 
of baseball, he explains. He was overshadowing the All-Star game, the pennant 
races. He didn't want it to extend over into the playoffs and World Series. 
Pete took himself out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Giamatti just wanted to get the matter out of the courts. 
Baseball fears the courts the way safecrackers do. And for somewhat the same 
reasons. It is operating outside the law and knows it. Giamatti well knows it 
takes years to convict serial killers through American jurisprudence. Appeals 
take longer. In this country, a man is presumed innocent even after he's been 
proved guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing a living legend, the man who got the most hits in baseball history, 
through the courts would have been like pursuing little Liza over the ice in 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
</P>
<P>
Is the integrity of baseball preserved? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that depends on what integrity you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
The integrity that prompts an outfielder who traps a ball to hold it up in 
triumph to deceive the umpire into thinking it was a legal catch? 
</P>
<P>
The integrity of the pitcher who scuffs up or spits on a ball, or the hitter 
who corks the bat? 
</P>
<P>
The catcher who shifts an outside pitch to fool the umpire into thinking it was 
a strike? 
</P>
<P>
The groundskeeper who wets down the basepaths or lets the infield grass grow to 
slow down a faster team or foil a harder-hitting team? 
</P>
<P>
So what has happened here? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it would appear that Pete Rose has been banned for life -- or one year. 
Whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
What does this do to his eligibility for the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Pete appears to have thought of that. By making it a condition of the 
compromise that he not have to make a clear admission of guilt, he maintains 
the fiction that he is throwing himself into a volcano -- or on a grenade -- 
for the good of the game. He's a team player. Injured innocence plays well in 
the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone else banned from baseball for life was banned for fixing games, 
not betting on them. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is not Shoeless Joe Jackson. What Pete did is against the rules. What 
Jackson did was against the law. Pete made a mistake. Jackson committed a 
felony. Pete bet -- if indeed he did -- on his own team. Jackson bet on the 
other team. In a World Series. One guy is a crook, the other just dumb. 
</P>
<P>
To get into the Hall of Fame, a player must pass a six-man screening committee 
and get 75% of the baseball writers' votes, around 400. Rose, of course, would 
have gone in by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
But what if he's still under suspension in 1992, when he becomes eligible for 
the Hall? The critical paragraph in the rules for election reads: "Candidates 
shall be chosen on the basis of playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, 
character, their contribution to the team or teams on which they played and to 
baseball in general." 
</P>
<P>
Is that Pete? 
</P>
<P>
Well, look, Babe Ruth is in the Hall of Fame, right? Everybody loves the Babe, 
but he wasn't Frank Merriwell, now, was he? He had character flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Ty Cobb, if you can believe what you read, was all character flaw. Grover 
Cleveland Alexander had troubles. Don't forget, Prohibition was the law of the 
land in their days. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball makes a crime of an activity that is not only legal in some states but 
is even run by some states. 
</P>
<P>
You can't fire the president of General Motors for betting on baseball games. 
In fact, you can't fire the President of the United States for it. I'm not even 
sure you can fire the president of the Cincinnati Reds. But you can fire the 
manager. Bart Giamatti did. 
</P>
<P>
A. Bartlett Giamatti is a tough guy. Don't let the button-down collar and the 
Ivy League background fool you. He won't cop out to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rose) has stained the game and must pay the consequences," Giamatti says 
coldly. "He has violated Rule 21 by betting on his own team." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is not used to people blocking the plate on him like that. He usually 
knocks them into the first row of seats. But Giamatti makes the tag. The 
agreement with Rose is what's on the table, not under it, he claims. 
Reinstatement, he insists, will be based on "confident steps toward 
rehabilitation, which should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement does not mandate rehabilitation or treatment for this 
gambling Rose. And Pete Rose wants it known he does not need any. He is not a 
compulsive gambler, he says. The agreement does not mandate admission (or 
denial) of guilt. So Pete denies it: "Regardless of what the commissioner says, 
I did not bet on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
This is known in the better care units as "denial." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is pretty clear that Pete Rose's life was spent ricochetting from 
the pick six windows at Turfway Park to the back rooms around Fountain Square. 
If it moved, Pete bet it. 
</P>
<P>
But does anyone seriously think Babe Ruth didn't have a bet down on 
Dempsey-Tunney in 1927? Pete Rose is not the only ballplayer in history to have 
had his own bookie. At least it wasn't Arnold Rothstein. Ruth had his own 
bootlegger. 
</P>
<P>
Has a deal been cut? Giamatti won't admit it, but plea-bargaining is the 
American way of life. Rapists get in on it, mass murderers, bank robbers. Pete 
Rose sees himself as the Prisoner of Shark Island. The victim of historic 
injustice. A guy ridden out of the game he loves on a rail because of bad 
companions. But he has agreed not to take the commissioner to court any more or 
challenge legally this apparent death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone would feel better if he would get on TV, like Jimmy Swaggart, 
and cry a lot. But Pete's no good at crying. He better hope Bart Giamatti is.

A SECOND COMING; 
</P>
<P>
THE RAIDERS' RETURN IS ONLY TEMPORARY, BUT OAKLAND'S LOYAL FANS ARE HOPING FOR 
SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT 
</P>

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pinch 'em, they're dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
It's like the glory days, only better. Everywhere the locals look, the Jolly 
Raider flies, their beloved, behelmeted figure with the eyepatch and crossed 
swords, and the promoters' slogan for this game: The Passion Returns. 
</P>
<P>
Banners flutter all along Broadway downtown and festoon Hegenberger Road, the 
route from the airport. Can you imagine the look on Al Davis' face -- try a 
grimace masking the glee -- when he rides in, once more a conquering hero? 
There are billboards, a downtown pep rally with the mayor, Raider alumni 
functions, prime-time TV specials on three stations, an outdoor DiamondVision 
screen going up in Jack London Square to show the game. Oh, silver! Oh, black! 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this actually more like Napoleon's retreat with his battered army? 
</P>
<P>
Forget that, Jack. What happened to the team in L.A. is L.A.'s problem, they've 
suffered enough slights of their own here, thank you. The Raiders are back for 
an exhibition game, and who knows, if Oakland can deliver on that $75 million 
it has offered, they could be back next year to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Al will make the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
How about at tonight's black-tie $150-a-plate banquet honoring Raider Hall of 
Famers, keynote speech by an actual former President of the United States, 
Gerald Ford? 
</P>
<P>
Picture it . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's late in the evening. They've eaten, they've drunk, they've laughed, 
they've cried. The old glories hang in the air like a champagne mist. 
</P>
<P>
Finally a lean, solitary figure with a pompadour, dark glasses and a ring whose 
three huge, football-shaped diamonds throw reflections to the far walls, 
ascends to the podium. He stretches his arms out slowly. There are tears in his 
eyes. He says the magic words. Momma! They're home! 
</P>
<P>
But it's not happening. 
</P>
<P>
Not just yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are up for grabs, but the offers are too tentative. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento's offer of a $50-million signing bonus? 
</P>
<P>
The developers reportedly expect $40 million of that to be public money. They 
haven't yet solicited the public's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's proposed $32-million front money? 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a proposal that must be ratified by the Oakland City Council and 
the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland City Manager Henry Gardner is still going over the numbers and won't 
make his recommendation to the City Council until the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which pursued and lost an eminent domain suit against the Raiders 
through the 1980s, is studying this proposal, shall we say, painstakingly. It 
isn't scheduled to meet again until Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Saturday night's exhibition appearance against the Houston Oilers remains 
symbolic. It's remarkable and unprecedented and it did settle the issue of 
whether the Raiders would be welcomed back (the game sold out 55,000 seats in 2 
1/2 hours). But, hype notwithstanding, nothing will be settled this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said last week in Oxnard that speculation he'd be carried away by a tidal 
wave of emotion and make an announcement at the dinner, or at halftime of the 
game, is "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
But tidal waves wash two ways. Oakland, with its school system projecting a 
$14-million deficit next year, has a lot worse problems than a missing football 
team. But if the city fathers who are facing a mayoralty election see their 
constituents all packing up and heading for the party, they'll notice. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, adept at keeping his own counsel until the last moment, can sit back and 
let natural forces work for him. 
</P>
<P>
He's got it. 
</P>
<P>
They want it. 
</P>
<P>
Comparisons may be somewhat unfair to Angelenos, who once loved to put on their 
Sunday silver-and-black, bare-knuckle finery and cheer this antidote to those 
effete-L.A. jokes. 
</P>
<P>
You could argue that what really happened in Los Angeles was that Davis let his 
team run down while engaging in another squabble with another landlord, that 
attendance fell and, when the team entered its quasi-lame-duck phase, 
plummeted. Under Davis, the Oakland Raiders never went two seasons without 
posting a winning record or making the playoffs. The Los Angeles Raiders have 
just gone three. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it's different here. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has anything but a civic inferiority complex. It was Los Angeles 
before the Raiders arrived, and will remain the same if they leave. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, they weren't so sure who they were. 
</P>
<P>
Howie Long, who spent his first two pro seasons here, recently compared it to a 
wife who leaves and returns home eight years later . . . to find her spouse has 
been setting a place for her at dinner every night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique community," Long says. "It identifies so much with the team. The 
identity of the Raiders was linked to Oakland, and the identity of Oakland was 
linked to the Raiders. They're synonymous. It's one and the same." 
</P>
<P>
You might wonder if the Oakland fans copied motorcycle-riding, 
handlebar-mustachioed Ben Davidson, or if it was the other way around. The 
Raiders were Oakland and Oakland was the Raiders, all right. 
</P>
<P>
Their outlaw appeal reached across the Bay, too, into the heart of snooty, 
despised San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us were closet Raider fans for many years," says the Chronicle's 
man-about-town columnist, Herb Caen. 
</P>
<P>
"I always preferred the Raiders. They were rough, tough, rotten guys. The 
Niners were Mr. Clean. Bill Walsh is a rather God-like figure. (John) Madden 
and the Raiders were like the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"There were wonderful scenes in the parking lot before games. It looked like 
'Road Warrior.' It was fun to go around and see the people barbecuing what 
looked like other people." 
</P>
<P>
Nor would time and separation change their love. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the '80s, you could look around the community and the Raider logo was 
everywhere," says Steve Page, an official of the Oakland Athletics, who had 
their own problems with the Raiders. "It's never really died." 
</P>
<P>
In the first years after the move/betrayal/abandonment, Bay Area TV ratings for 
Raider games were higher than in Los Angeles. Raider games are still carried on 
local radio. The voice of the Raiders is still Bill King, a Bay Area 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '80s, an Eastbay fan named Don Maroney started a Raider newspaper. 
He was a kid in high school when the Raiders left, but now he has a printing 
company in Hayward and a passion on the side that he can indulge. Since his 
paper is independent, he can't use the team name or logos so he calls it The 
SportsPage and gives Bay Area fans the full Raider panoply, which the local 
papers are missing. 
</P>
<P>
His circulation is 23,000. For the current issue, they're printing 37,000. 
</P>
<P>
With no reason to believe the Raiders would return, with civic memories focused 
on how they had been burned and civic energy focused on getting an expansion 
team, Maroney campaigned for the pipe dream of pipe dreams, bringing the 
Raiders back. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1987 and the Irwindale move was stalled when he went to an Alameda 
County Board of Supervisors meeting to ask why they didn't pursue the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
A board member called Raider limited partner Jack Brooks to ask if a bid would 
be entertained. Brooks said it would. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Oakland Coliseum Commission was casting around for an NFL 
exhibition game to show that it was still fertile country for an expansion 
team. Commission head George Vukasin struck a deal with Oiler owner Bud Adams, 
whose first plan to bring in another team for an '88 game was foiled by a 
conflict with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Vukasin, still working on it, attended the '88 NFL meetings in Phoenix. 
Spotting Davis across a lobby, he suggested to the Oakland Tribune's Jon 
Rochmis that he ask Davis if he'd consider playing in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Rochmis did. Davis glared at him and walked away without a word. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, the Raiders decided it wasn't such a bad idea, after all. 
Their cut is reportedly $500,000, a huge haul for an exhibition, and besides 
they are getting a free marketing survey. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Oakland bids for permanent possession. 
</P>
<P>
It bids within oft-mentioned parameters, however. Raider fandom is somewhat 
split between enthusiasts from the surrounding towns such as Fremont and 
Hayward, and the residents of the poor central core, who have an array of urban 
woes staring them in the face every day. Oakland is not inclined to run 
financial risks for a large plaything. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider deal is represented as costing nothing, since it would be financed 
by the Coliseum's bonds and repaid from luxury box profits. The key is the 
city's faith that the Raiders would continue to sell out, as they did for their 
last 11 seasons in Oakland, ensuring that there will be profits. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a done deal, but they're working on it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we dreamed of years ago," Maroney says. "Not too many people 
shared that dream. It's exciting to see people in the area sharing it now. 
</P>
<P>
"America was founded on people standing up for what they believed in, but it's 
never happened in sports before. This is unprecedented. Not only the Raiders 
coming back to Oakland, but sports fans standing up for what they believed. 
This wasn't some politician's idea. This came from the fans, the ones who got 
burned last time." 
</P>
<P>
The guys with their heads on swivels are the Raider players, obliged to play 
before dwindling gatherings -- their two exhibitions have drawn two of the 
franchise's three smallest crowds in Los Angeles -- while awaiting new marching 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Howie Long says. "Lack of enthusiasm in the stands tends to be less 
inspirational on the field. It doesn't send the chills down your spine. It's 
not that magic moment that you dream about growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally? I'd like to play there (Oakland) and live here (Los Angeles.) We've 
had that kind of enthusiasm here once -- the AFC championship in '83. That's 
one time when it hopped -- like it did every week up there. Every week up 
there, that's just the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
Only Long, Matt Millen and Todd Christensen of current Raiders ever played in 
Oakland. Vann McElroy and Marcus Allen lived there as rookies in 1982, when the 
Raiders practiced in Oakland and played in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, there was a lot of resentment about the team leaving," McElroy 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad. People were very upset. You could see there was a lot of fan 
support because people were upset about it. Little comments were made, but most 
of the people realized a player is paid to do what he's paid to do. He plays 
the game wherever it is. That's a management situation. Management is going to 
do what it's going to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a knock against anybody. I don't want to say L.A.'s a bad place or 
Oakland's the place. When the stadium's filled, you feel the excitement when 
you walk in. I haven't felt that here in a long time. We had that on our drive 
to the Super Bowl (1984). The place was packed and, I mean, it was exciting. 
You walked out on the the field and chills went down you. I mean, you got fired 
up to play a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you go out there, you got 30,000 people, it looks like a scrimmage. You've 
got to really work mentally to get yourself going. It becomes more of a job." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, they get their chills back. 
</P>
<P>
What Oakland gets, it will have to wait to find out.

But then, in Rose's Thursday response to his lifetime suspension from baseball, 
he kept repeating himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not bet on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
According to the women, with every similar comment, office by office, the TV 
sets and radios were turned down. And then clicked off. Slowly, with some 
embarrassment, people went back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Later the three administrative assistants, like much of Cincinnati, gathered to 
mourn the fact that Cincinnati had finally grown tired of its hero. 
</P>
<P>
"The more everybody in our offices heard Pete talk, the more we finally said, 
'OK, something is wrong here,' " said Balsley. "With every denial, it got 
stranger and stranger. A little more of him chipped away. 
</P>
<P>
"We still love him. But c'mon." 
</P>
<P>
They nursed their beers inside Flanagan's Landing tavern, a riverside bar 
serving bratwurst, beer, and old sitcoms on the corner television. Outside a 
picture window, running for several blocks east to west, is Pete Rose Way. 
</P>
<P>
While talking about Rose, the women tried not to look out. A couple of men at a 
nearby table didn't care. One even pointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, not very many of my friends call it Pete Rose Way anyway," said Mark 
Helling, 31. "It's still Second Street. Like, 'Hey, let's check out the bars on 
Second Street.' 
</P>
<P>
"To do anything on Pete Rose Way, it sounds funny." 
</P>
<P>
Many in this usually carefree river town tried to shrug off the burden of 
betrayal Thursday. Many reacted to the news of the Cincinnati Reds' manager's 
banishment with relief, then hurt. There was little anger. They wasted that 
emotion long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people here had already come to grips with what might happen 
to Pete," said Dan Hurley, 43, local historian. "When it finally started to 
hurt the team, everybody wondered why, if he was innocent, he just wouldn't 
step down until it was resolved. He was clearly putting his own interests ahead 
of the team's. 
</P>
<P>
"So when it finally happened, most of us were just glad to get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of Rose's suspension, the Reds' first chore was to find 
a new manager. They did it by 4:30 p.m., less than eight hours after the 
announcement of a suspension settlement between baseball Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti and Rose. After an emotional, if erroneous, speech by Red owner Marge 
Schott, they announced the interim appointment of Rose's longtime dugout coach 
and friend, Tommy Helms. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the happiest day I've known," Schott told a crowded news 
conference, her voice shaking. "'As you know, I'm the one who really got Pete 
Rose to come back to Cincinnati in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, however, had already been the Reds' manager for several months when 
Schott became the majority owner in the winter of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Schott continued: 
</P>
<P>
"For five years, it was the Pete and Marge Show. And we really had some fun. 
</P>
<P>
"But what counts is the integrity of baseball. While this outcome is a sad one, 
it was something the commissioner had to do to protect this sport." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of more sentences, Schott turned toward a thin, unsmiling man 
along the wall. Her voice became cheery. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you noticed this guy who came in with me -- he is going to take over," 
she said, turning to him. "Everybody welcome Tommy Helms . . . and will you win 
the next 10? OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Helms did not find it amusing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very sad day for me," he said. "As much as I've wanted a big 
league managing job, this is no way to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Said General Manager Murray Cook: 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen in this game . . . but I think it would be safe to say 
(Helms) would probably be around until the end of the year. But we are making a 
list of candidates right now. Tommy is certainly going to be on that list, but 
there will be others." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he wanted his manager to have control and stability. He acknowledged 
that Rose's off-the-field problems might have hurt the Reds on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is so much a game of routine and habit, and when you miss that, when 
things get in the way, it hurts," Cook said. "We were winning the first two 
months, but the problems were there. And pretty soon it all caught up with us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Helms, who spoke with Rose early Thursday: "I'll be my own manager. . . . 
I won't get advice from Pete. But what has happened probably won't even sink in 
until I get to the ballpark and get the uniform on. Then it will hit me." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Cincinnati was more prepared for the news. City Councilman John 
Mirlisena, chairman of the Public Works Committee that decides street names, 
was ready with an answer about changing the name of Pete Rose Way. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been conversation about that, but I will not recommend that, and I 
will not accept recommendations for that," he said from his city hall office. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the white lines, Pete Rose deserves that sign. He might have a 
gambling problem, he might need help like all kinds of addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still believe in him. It's not like he was a drug pusher or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hurley: "There has been an effort to distinguish Pete's playing career 
from his personal life. But deep down, I don't think most of us can do it. Most 
of us still wonder, how can he look people in the eye and keep denying this 
thing? 
</P>
<P>
"I think Cincinnati is seeing that Pete has a sickness. Like (Thursday's) 
demonstration at his press conference. What a sickening indication of how blind 
he is. What a desperate grabbing for straws." 
</P>
<P>
Back at Flanagan's Landing, Jim Unkrich was shaking has head. 
</P>
<P>
"He's up there talking like he will be reinstated -- who is going to reinstate 
him?" said Unkrich, 30, an auto technician. "What's he done, rehabilitate 
himself? I think we all get a little mad because he acts like it will all go 
away in a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to live with it on TV since February, every night. And we know it 
won't go away." 
</P>
<P>
So at least some of Cincinnati has decided it's time to move on to something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, you know what the big thing around here now is?" asked Balsley, 
one of the Procter &amp; Gamble workers. 
</P>
<P>
She pulled out a cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking is big? 
</P>
<P>
"No, look at the insignia." 
</P>
<P>
It was the helmet design of the Cincinnati Bengals. One of the roads 
intersecting Pete Rose Way is Bengal Way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on to other things now," Balsley said. "We can't wait for the football 
season. It can't be as long as this baseball season. We'll be glad to worry 
about Pete Rose again. But later."

THE PETE ROSE DECISION;

<P>

<P>
BASEBALL'S OVERALL PRAISE OF GIAMATTI IS TEMPERED BY SYMPATHY FOR ROSE

<P>
Peter Ueberroth, who began the Pete Rose investigation when he was commissioner 
of baseball, lauded successor Bart Giamatti's decision to ban Rose for life 
Thursday but thinks Rose belongs in baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bart Giamatti accomplished two important things for baseball," 
Ueberroth said. "One is total fairness, and second is preserving the integrity 
of the commissioner's office and the institution of baseball by the resolution 
of this matter. I think people will realize that over a period of time, and it 
augurs very well for his administration." 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth indicated that he was in close touch with Giamatti during the 
seven-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution did not surprise me," he said. "He's kept me informed. I talked 
with him (Wednesday) and (Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
"I think the timing is good because there are races in all the divisions, and 
it's time to focus back on the field of play." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ueberroth said, Rose's accomplishments as a player should not be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Pete Rose will be elected to the Hall of Fame, and his efforts and 
results as a player indicate that he's certainly a Hall of Fame player." 
</P>
<P>
But unless he is reinstated before he becomes eligible for the Hall in 1992, 
Rose will be the first player to appear on a Hall of Fame ballot while under 
suspension from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how that might affect Rose's chances for reinstatement, Ueberroth said: 
"I wouldn't hazard a guess one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lang, executive secretary of the Baseball Writers' Assn. of America since 
1966, said Rose is far from a cinch to be reinstated, should he apply at the 
end of his first year of suspension, as he indicated he would. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Manson and Sirhan Sirhan come up for parole every year, and they don't 
get it," Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been a banned player that was qualified to be on the ballot," he 
said. " . . . His name will be on the ballot. It will then be up to the 
baseball writers to decide if he belongs in there." 
</P>
<P>
BBWAA President Phil Pepe of the New York Daily News said: "If he's still 
banned when his turn comes up, that certainly will affect his chances of 
getting into the Hall of Fame. I don't think it will keep him out. His 
credentials are unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
"In talking to a lot of my fellow voters, some say it wouldn't matter to them, 
and some say they couldn't in good conscience vote for somebody who is under 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to make that decision now. I have three years to think about it 
and a lot can happen in three years. And suppose he is reinstated. Maybe 
nobody's going to hire him. He didn't do such a good job as a manager this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rose denies betting on baseball, other baseball people strongly 
supported Giamatti's action because they believe that Rose broke a basic 
baseball rule -- Section 21 (d) of the Major League Rules. 
</P>
<P>
E.J. (Buzzie) Bavasi, former executive of the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego 
Padres, retired and living in La Jolla, still knows the rule by heart -- and is 
certain that Rose did, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Rule 21 is very, very clear," Bavasi said. " 'Any player, umpire or club or 
league official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball 
game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be 
declared permanently ineligible.' 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in there about an appeal whatsoever. There's nothing Giamatti 
could do but suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose is one gentleman in this game who knows the rules better than anyone 
else . . . even better than Gene Mauch. He knew what he was doing. Good gravy, 
all you have to do is walk in the clubhouse and you'll see the sign. Matter of 
fact, I noticed the other day -- I think it was in Cincinnati -- on the 
outfield fence it said, 'No gambling.' I'm a purist when it comes to this." 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi noted that one of his Brooklyn Dodger managers, Leo Durocher, was 
suspended for the entire 1947 season "just for knowing a couple of gamblers." 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Palm Springs, Durocher declined comment on the Rose case. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do interviews," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi added: "The Hall of Fame is for what (Rose) did on the field. He did not 
throw a baseball game . . . did nothing to change the course of a game. Pete 
just bet on the game because he wanted to make a dollar or two. I don't think 
this should have any bearing on his 30 years in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Others expressed sympathy for Rose and agreed that he belongs in the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Sparky Anderson of the Detroit Tigers, who managed Rose at Cincinnati, 
said: "It makes you sad what happened today, but Pete stood there and took it 
like a man . . . like I knew he would." 
</P>
<P>
Former teammate Johnny Bench, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame this year, 
said: "It's crushing to all of us who played with him. You really feel sorry 
for the situation Pete got himself into. If he bet on baseball and bet on the 
Reds, that's just the rules of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose will remain a friend. He has to live with this. It'll never be out 
of his mind because people won't let him forget." 
</P>
<P>
Charles O. Finley, former owner of the Oakland Athletics, had an ongoing feud 
with another baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, but said of Giamatti: "I 
thought he handled it very professionally. I thought the commissioner made 
himself very clear, and I think it's imperative that everyone lives up to the 
rules of baseball, regardless of what his name may be. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Hall of Fame is concerned, I think (Rose) very definitely has 
earned his spurs for qualification." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Kuhn was quoted as saying: "I think the game and the commissioner's 
office come out strong. I think (Giamatti) made the right decision. On the down 
side, personally, I regret this happened to one of the great players of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn also doubted that Rose will ever be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a tough sell," he said. "He has every right to apply, but it will 
be tough." 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger public relations man read a statement from owner Peter O'Malley: "We 
believe that Commissioner Giamatti acted diligently and firmly in resolving 
this complex matter, and we support his decision. In particular, we are pleased 
that the commissioner's authority to enforce the rules of major league baseball 
was not diminished by this case." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda was at a momentary and unusual loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I can say about it," Lasorda said. "It's a sad day, 
particularly for a guy like Pete, a guy who's been an inspiration and an 
example to millions of people on what you could attain in life if you really 
put forth the effort and hard work. He utilized all of his abilities and became 
one of the premier ballplayers of this century. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the thing is over. It's been lingering too long. I think it's a 
lesson to let everybody know . . . that's a rule (Section 21 (d)) that 
everybody knows about. We have to read that rule to our team every year about 
gambling on baseball. We even bring in the law enforcement (people) to talk 
about gambling. You can't bet on your sport. He denies doing it, but yet they 
suspended him. What did they suspend him for? 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad. It really is sad . . . a guy has to go out in that fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Former Angel manager Gene Mauch hadn't heard about Thursday's announcement and 
was confused when the details were told to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say something off the wall until I really understand what all 
this means," Mauch said. "The only thing that would cause Pete to be banished 
lifetime is the acknowledgement that he did bet on his team. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have bet on baseball . . . anything and not been suspended for life. 
The lifetime banishment would have been for betting on his own team. That 
leaves me totally confused. I don't know why Pete would accept it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for Giamatti. It was something he didn't initiate. The 
commissioner's office had investigated this long before a very troubled 
Bartlett Giamatti got hold of it. And I feel terribly sorry for Pete if he did 
some of the things people say he did. Everybody knows he is a Hall of Fame 
ballplayer, regardless of whether he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
"The integrity and the power of the commissioner's office is an absolute must. 
If we don't have the power of the commissioner's office, baseball is going to 
be in serious trouble. The threat of banishment from the game for gambling 
should be there." 
</P>
<P>
Like Mauch, Pepe was confused by some of Rose's comments Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'compromise' exists only in Pete Rose's mind," Pepe said. "Giamatti, as 
far as he's concerned, there is no compromise. The man is banned for life. And 
here's Rose saying, 'Well, I expect to be back in a year.' I don't know what he 
bases that on. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to think he (agreed to accept the suspension) for the good of 
the game because it was interfering with an exciting season, but I don't think 
that's the reason. 
</P>
<P>
"His denials indicate he's not cured of whatever his problem is. I think he's 
living in a dream world. He's either putting up a facade, or he has no clue of 
what exactly he is guilty of."

TRUMBULL UNPLUGS SAN PEDRO POWER, 6-3

Trumbull, Conn., took advantage of five errors and five walks Thursday to 
defeat the Eastview All-Stars of San Pedro, 6-3, in the Little League World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut will face Taiwan, a 13-0 winner over Venezuela, in the championship 
game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 19,800 watched San Pedro take a 2-0 lead in the first inning on back 
to back home runs by Tim Harper and Gary Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
But Connecticut sent 11 batters to the plate in the bottom half of the inning 
and scored five runs on three San Pedro errors and four walks by two Eastview 
pitchers. The last man in the batting order, Dave Galla, got the only run 
batted in and the only hit of the inning on a soft liner to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sulentor opened the second inning with a home run for San Pedro but that 
was all the West champions could muster against Trumbull pitcher Andy Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut scored its final run in the third inning on two San Pedro errors. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing the three homers on fastballs, Paul turned to an off-speed pitch 
he calls "the dart" to keep San Pedro's power-hitting lineup in check. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro averaged 12 runs in 18 previous games. PAUL McLEOD

STOTZ, 79, FOUNDED LITTLE LEAGUE, THEN FOUND HE COULD DO WITHOUT IT WHEN IT 
BECAME BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl (Tuck) Stotz, who created Little League baseball here 50 years ago, lives 
two miles from the Little League World Series Stadium in this north-central 
Pennsylvania town. 
</P>
<P>
But he isn't attending any of the 43rd annual Little League World Series games 
this week. He never goes. He boycotts the championship series every year. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were running Little League, I would eliminate the World Series," said 
Stotz, 79. "It takes away from the sport what Little League is all about, a 
chance to play neighborhood baseball. The World Series isn't in keeping with 
the game. It's too unnatural." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot 8-inch, 112-pound founder of Little League ball, now played by more 
than 2.5 million youngsters in 34 nations -- it's the world's largest organized 
youth sports program -- believes Little League has far out grown his original 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
Stotz is honored in the Founders Room of the 7-year-old, $2.5-million Peter J. 
McGovern Little League Museum next to the World Series Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only sports museum dedicated to a kids' game. Among exhibits are 
photographs of Stotz at the first Little League game, pictures of Stotz with 
Ford Frick, with Connie Mack and other baseball greats. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Stotz has never set foot in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"No sir, I've never been in the museum and I never intend to go there," he 
said. "A lot of things happened to Little League that do not agree with my 
philosophy of the game." 
</P>
<P>
A statue of three boys in baseball uniforms, each with an upraised glove, as if 
to catch a ball, was dedicated two months ago at the site of the first Little 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was invited to the dedication but I did not accept the invitation," Stotz 
said "But I went anyway because 14 of the boys, now men in their late 50s and 
early 60s, who played Little League that first year were there and I wanted to 
be with them." 
</P>
<P>
Stotz, a lifelong resident of Williamsport, was a 28-year-old oil company clerk 
in the summer of 1938 when he played catch with his nephews, Major and Jimmy 
Gehron. 
</P>
<P>
"We played, then we sat around talking baseball," he said. "I played baseball 
when I was their age. I loved the game. I told them I thought it would be great 
if they could play on a regular team with uniforms, a new ball for every game, 
bats they could really swing." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he told his nephews to round up some of their friends to play 
scrub ball at a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
"I piled 10 kids in my 1934 Plymouth," he recalled. "We took newspapers and 
folded them to represent bases. We did this several times that summer." 
</P>
<P>
Stotz said that over the winter, he made plans for a Little League in 
Williamsport. He was married, had two daughters, but no sons. He recruited two 
of his friends, George and Bert Bebble to manage teams. The league was formed 
with three teams sponsored by local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
On June 6, 1939, the first Little League game was played by boys 8 to 12 on 
teams sponsored by Lycoming Dairy and Lundy Lumber at a park in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
"Max Miller was my pitcher on the Lycoming Dairy team," Stotz mused. "I told 
him not to walk anybody, to throw strikes and make them hit. Well, he threw 
strikes and in the first inning they got seven runs. The second inning they 
knocked eight more runs . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A scoreboard in the Little League Museum recalls that game: LYCOMING DAIRY 1 0 
0 3 3 1 -- TOTAL 8; LUNDY LUMBER 7 8 4 2 2 X -- TOTAL 23. The next year four 
teams made up the Williamsport Little League. In 1946, there were 12 Little 
Leagues, all in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
By 1950, the year California became part of the program, there were 376 Little 
Leagues with 150,000 boys in 22 states. By 1955 there were Little Leagues in 48 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Little League was incorporated in 1948 and Stotz was named commissioner. One of 
his rules was that Little League baseball never be played on Sunday. That has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Many other changes occurred, as well. In 1955, Stotz, unhappy with the way 
things were going, removed himself from the national organization. 
</P>
<P>
But he has stayed active with his original Williamsport four-team Little 
League, an independent group, no longer affiliated with the international 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The history of Little League, from its inception by Carl Stotz to the present, 
is vividly recalled with memorabilia, uniforms, equipment, special exhibits, 
graphics, photographs, films and video clips in the Peter J. McGovern Little 
League Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is on the 42-acre Little League complex here. It includes the Little 
League international headquarters building, World Series Stadium, five other 
baseball diamonds and housing for World Series teams. McGovern was president of 
Little League from 1952 until his death in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Creighton J. Hale is the current president and chief executive officer. 
Cynthia Stearns, 30, who was marketing manager for the Harlem Globetrotters in 
Los Angeles, has been director of the Little League Museum since January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Museum visitors step into a re-creation of the 1982 World Series game between 
Kirkland, Wash., and Taiwan's Pu-Tzu Town team, which Kirkland won. A blowup of 
a color photo of the grandstands filled with the World Series crowd is wrapped 
around two walls. 
</P>
<P>
Video clips from all 42 previous Little League World Series are available for 
viewing. There's a huge map tracing Little League's phenomenal growth. Little 
Leaguers and anyone else who wish to try out their skills may do so in pitching 
and batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's collections are updated and enlarged each year with new 
memorabilia and artifacts, with films and photographs of the latest World 
Series play and major new developments in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Brucker of San Pedro, 12-year-old home run hitter and first baseman of 
the Eastview Little League team, is a shoo-in for a special exhibit in the 
museum, since she became the first American girl ever to play in the Little 
League World Series this week. She also became the first girl to get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of all the world champion teams since 1947 are displayed. First 
foreign team to win the World Series was Monterrey, Mexico, in 1957. That team 
repeated in 1958. Teams from Taiwan have won the title 13 times, teams from 
Japan three times and teams from Korea twice. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush visited Poland earlier this year, he threw out the first 
pitch for the first Little League game ever played in that country and 
presented a certificate of charter to the first four Little League teams there. 
The Soviet Union is expected to launch a Little League program soon. 
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania teams have won more world championships than any other state, four 
times. California, New Jersey and Connecticut teams have won three times. Teams 
from New York and Texas have won twice and Alabama, New Mexico, Michigan, 
Washington and Georgia have each won once. 
</P>
<P>
Two thirds to 75% of the major league players today are Little League 
graduates. And the most popular exhibits in the museum are perhaps those 
featuring photographs and memorabilia from major league players of their Little 
League years. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs showing Orel Hershiser, Mike Schmidt, Tom Seaver, Carl Yastrzemski, 
Carney Lansford, Boog Powell, Gary Carter, Jim Palmer, Nolan Ryan and many 
other major leaguers as youngsters in their Little League uniforms are here. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, are uniforms, caps, gloves, jackets, shoes and socks major leaguers 
wore when they were 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 year-old Little Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
There's Seaver when he played in the Spartan Little League in Fresno; Carter, 
in the West Fullerton Little League; Palmer in the Beverly Hills Little League; 
Lansford in the Briarwood Little League in Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Seaver, now on the board of directors of the museum, said last year when he was 
became the first person enshrined in the museum's Hall of Excellence: "Of all 
the accolades and honors I've received throughout my baseball career, two of 
which I'm most proud are my University of Southern California baseball jersey 
hanging in the Smithsonian and my Little League all-star hat on display in the 
Little League Museum." 
</P>
<P>
Lansford, Powell, Rick Wise and Jim Barbieri have all played in both the Little 
League and major league World Series. This year, Carl Yastrzemski became the 
first former Little Leaguer inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan recalled his playing days with the Alvin (Tex.) Little League: 
"Little League was a great period in my life. We never won a championship but 
we tried real hard. I guess that's what Little League is all about -- trying." 
</P>
<P>
One exhibit at the museum is devoted to the parents of major league baseball 
players who were actively involved in their sons' Little League career. Award 
winners include the parents of Mike Schmidt, Steve Garvey, Keith Hernandez, 
Palmer, Carter, Dale Murphy, Ryan and Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
On July 7, President Bush stood before 5,000 on the South Lawn of the White 
House and paid tribute to the golden anniversary of Little League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I coached my four sons in Little League and Barbara was the team scorekeeper 
and organized the car pool," he said. "We had 1,000 kids in our league and I 
think Barbara drove them all home." 
</P>
<P>
Parents of Little Leaguers from presidents through all walks of life have 
dedicated their time and energy to the success of Little League baseball, 
founded 50 years ago by Stotz.

NEWSWIRE: ATHLETE SAYS CANADIANS KNEW OF DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Findlay, the athletes' representative for the Canadian Track and Field 
Assn. admitted Thursday at the Canadian Government's inquiry into drug use 
among athletes that he had evidence of steroid use by some of Canada's top 
athletes eight months before the Seoul Olympics. He said Wilf Wedmann, 
association president, refused to act. 
</P>
<P>
Wedmann, who testified briefly before the inquiry adjourned for the day, will 
have a chance to answer the allegation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay told the inquiry his evidence was based on a January, 1988, meeting 
with Canadian decathlete Dave Steen. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay said Steen told him that Dr. Jamie Astaphan had offered him steroids in 
late 1987, confirming earlier testimony by Steen. Steen also told him Astaphan 
had been injecting sprinter Angela Issajenko with steroids to improve her 
performance after a poor showing at the national track competition in Ottawa in 
January of 1988. Astaphan has admitted he injected Issajenko, Ben Johnson and 
other athletes training with Coach Charlie Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay said he did not pursue the matter with Paul Dupre, who replaced Wedmann 
as president in May of 1988.

ANGELS RECALL CLARK TO REPLACE INJURED FINLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With still no exact reading on the nature of Chuck Finley's foot injury, the 
Angels announced Thursday that they were putting the left-handed pitcher on the 
15-day disabled list and recalling Terry Clark from triple-A Edmonton to 
replace Finley in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Finley underwent another battery of diagnostic tests Thursday at Inglewood's 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center, but after studying the results, Lewis Yocum, 
Angel team physician, said they were "inconclusive" as to whether Finley was 
suffering from a stress fracture or a sprained ligament in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Yocum prescribed conservative treatment for a week, meaning ice and ultrasound 
therapy, before performing the round of tests again. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Angels need someone to pitch Finley's next scheduled game, 
Saturday in Texas, so they decided to recall Clark, a 28-year-old right-hander, 
for the second time thisseason. 
</P>
<P>
He spent nine days with the Angels in early June, but didn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
With the Trappers, Clark was 11-5 with a 3.58 earned-run average in 20 starts. 
He had four complete games and two shutouts while striking out 90 and walking 
33 batters in 138 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Clark split time between Edmonton and the Angels, going 7-6 with 
the Trappers and 6-6 with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also considered the promotion of another Edmonton pitcher, 
hard-throwing, 24-year-old Mike Fetters, but Manager Doug Rader said the 
situation called for a more experienced hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry's experience had a lot to do with it," Rader said. "He had some success 
here before and he was throwing well at Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
Finley's placement on the 15-day disabled list is retroactive to Aug. 22, which 
means he will be eligible to return on Sept. 6, provided no stress fracture is 
found. Finley, the Angels' winningest pitcher at 14-8, will miss at least three 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly great timing for a team struggling to stay afloat in the American 
League West race. 
</P>
<P>
"All the teams I've been on that have won never lost somebody like that," said 
Angel pitcher Dan Petry, who participated in two playoffs with the Detroit 
Tigers. "This is like the Brewers losing (Jim) Gantner. You're trying to rally 
and this happens. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got to play the games and go about it, but you can't say it's not 
going to hurt."

he bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
March 27 -- Dowd says the investigation probably will last several more weeks. 
</P>
<P>

allegations against Rose in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
April 1 -- The Dayton Daily News reports that Internal Revenue Service 
investigators seized betting slips from Ron Peters on Aug. 17, 1988, one day 
after FBI agents obtained court permission to search Peters' car for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
April 5 -- The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that a man listed in court 
documents by the code name "G-1" and identified by sources as Rose bet between 
$8,000 and $16,000 daily on baseball games during the 1987 season. Gioiosa is

defraud the IRS. 
</P>

April 21 -- Rubin says that he resents the commissioner entering a "vendetta" 
against Rose. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Brichler says Rose is being

Hours after being banned from baseball for life, Pete Rose returned to cable 
television Thursday night to sell baseball memorabilia and tell viewers his 
achievements on the field still merit Hall of Fame selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think today's ruling has anything to do with me making the Hall of 
Fame," Rose told a viewer from San Diego who called on Cable Value Network, a 
home-shopping station. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being reinstated into baseball after a year. I did my 
part to go to the Hall of Fame, as far as I'm concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the hits, I scored the runs, I made the plays. I don't think anybody can 
take that away from me. But you never know. It's not in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, Rose held up an autographed plaque -- selling for $79.92 -- 
depicting him standing on first base after getting his 4,192nd hit to break Ty 
Cobb's record. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Commissioner Bart Giamatti barred Rose from baseball. Rose 
can apply for reinstatement after one year under the game's rules. Even if he 
is turned down, the game's most prolific hitter will be eligible for election 
to the Hall of Fame in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday marked Rose's second appearance on CVN. He also hawked bats and balls 
Wednesday night as word of his impending suspension spread, but didn't comment 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items Rose offered Thursday night were baseballs autographed by him 
and Steve Garvey with the number 4,192, selling for $79.92, and Red jerseys 
with Rose's name and number 14 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a piece of history," host Al Skantz said of the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of Pete Rose is available for $399.92, or four payments of $99.98. 
These were officially ordered by Pete." 
</P>
<P>
Added Rose: "Tell them we'll give them a letter with that." 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," Skantz said. "We'll give you a letter of authenticity." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, CVN chief financial officer Roger Cloutier said the company 
was not concerned about having Rose on the station on the day his suspension 
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're going to go on with the show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier said Rose planned to fly back to Cincinnati immediately after his 
two-hour appearance ended at 10 p.m. CDT. 
</P>
<P>
Rose had not previously worked for CVN, said Cloutier, who declined to disclose 
financial information about the station's agreement with Rose or discuss 
Wednesday night's sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING RULESection 21 (d) of the Major League Rules reads, in part: "Any 
player, umpire, or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum 
whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection which the bettor has a duty to 
perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible."

Pete Rose called it a compromise, and sadder words have seldom been spoken. 
Banned from baseball for life, the game's most prolific hitmaker has failed to 
grasp the action's possible permanence. He behaves as if his reinstatement were 
assured and time alone will cure his ailments. 
</P>
<P>
He acts as if he has salvaged something significant from his capitulation to 
Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
It was a compromise. It was on the same order as the one at Appomattox, whereby 
U.S. Grant received the Confederacy's unconditional surrender and Robert E. Lee 
was allowed to keep his sword.

Pete Rose is banned for life from baseball for gambling, and everyone except 
Pete Rose knows it. 
</P>
<P>
In the psychiatric world, a piece of real estate in which Rose might do well to 
invest what wealth he has remaining, they call this a form of behavior denial. 
Rose is to denial what he used to be to hitting. It's what he does best, and 
it's all he has left. For Rose, this is a different kind of hustle -- and the 
bluest note yet played in this hauntingly sad story. 
</P>
<P>
This man who came to represent baseball to a generation is an exile, apparently 
forever, with only the slightest chance for reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
He is exiled -- this makes it worse -- at his own hand, having pulled his world 
down on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Rose won't admit it. For all we know, he may not even believe it.

How dare Pete Rose insult us. How dare he stand before TV cameras, his stupid 
spiked hair sticking straight up, and evince no real remorse, take next to no 
responsibility for his actions and then, blithely and chillingly, say he hopes 
to be back in baseball posthaste. 
</P>
<P>
Having dishonored himself and his sport, all Pete Rose wanted to talk about was 
how soon he might be reinstated. Gall, thy name is Pete.

Ted Himka survived an early-morning playoff to earn the next-to-last place in 
the 64-man field, then went on to upset second-seeded Phil Mickelson Thursday 
in the first round of match play at the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Himka, who just graduated from the University of Washington, beat Mickelson, 
the 1989 NCAA champion from Arizona State, 4 and 2, on the par-70, 6,523-yard 
Merion Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Himka, 23, who won a first-round match in the tournament last year, never 
trailed after going 2-up with birdies on the first two holes. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, 19, a U.S. Walker Cup player, drew even at the eighth with a 
126-yard chip into the hole. But Himka regained the advantage on the next hole 
when he parred and Mickelson took a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Himka won two of the first three holes on the back nine for a 2-up lead, went 
3-up at 14, and closed out the match at 16, rolling in a seven-foot par putt 
while Mickelson bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, top-seeded Eoghan O'Connell survived a scare from 64th and lowest seed 
Tim Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, a Britain-Ireland Walker Cup player, beat Jackson, a 30-year-old 
accountant from Memphis, Tenn., 1-up, shooting a 7-over par 77. 
</P>
<P>
John Grace, a 41-year-old owner of a real estate company in Ft. Worth, ousted 
Neil Roderrick, 23, a Britain-Ireland Walker Cup player, 3 and 2. Roderrick was 
among the last group to qualify at 149. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Yates, 39, a losing finalist in the tournament last year, defeated Buddy 
Alexander, the golf coach at the University of Florida and 1986 national 
amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
Yates won, 4 and 2, moving ahead for good at the 11th hole, where Alexander 
lost a ball off the tee and took a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
In another upset, Dave Brookreson, 41, a Philadelphia sales representative who 
needed a playoff to qualify, defeated Doug Martin, 22, a Walker Cup member, 3 
and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Sigel, 45, of Berwyn, Pa., the 1982 and '83 champion, won 3 and 1 over Dave 
Cunningham, 20, a senior at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hare, Britain-Ireland Walker Cup player, beat Darren Veitch, a 
defenseman for the Toronto Maple Leafs, 5 and 3. Robert Gamez, another Walker 
Cup player, eliminated Greg Kennedy, a Georgia junior, 2 and 1.

SAILING / RICH ROBERTS: WEST COAST RACERS ARE UPSET AT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scheme proposed to prop up the United States Yacht Racing Union's troubled 
finances is making waves on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Val Hollingsworth, who runs an advertising business in Maine, writes in the 
current issue of USYRU's American Sailor magazine that yacht clubs should 
require their racing members to join USYRU, whose dues are $40 a year. The 
requirement would include crews, as well as owners and skippers, of everything 
from maxi boats to sabots. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but the clubs should, according to Hollingsworth: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Bill the racing members for their USYRU dues annually with club dues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Collect the money and send it to USYRU." 
</P>
<P>
If Hollingsworth's plan is to destroy small boat racing, he's on the right 
track. Many weekend dinghy sailors don't pay that much in yacht club dues. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the big boat racers already belong to USYRU, but even some of them 
would rebel at mandatory membership -- as it would be as if being told they had 
to vote Republican. They regard the Newport, R.I.,-based USYRU as a stuffy 
Eastern establishment organization that fails to relate to the side of the 
country that sails year-round. Worse, the proposal comes in the wake of a 
recent USYRU mailing requesting mid-year renewals for 1990 from its 22,000 
members, without offering incentives but, it is explained, to make its year-end 
bookkeeping easier. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, racing sailors don't resent the requirement of belonging to a yacht 
club. They need a club affiliation to establish a rating for handicap events, 
and they need a club's resources to organize and stage events. But many don't 
think they need USYRU. 
</P>
<P>
Others recognize the good things the organization does, such as providing a 
successful Olympic program, a rules appeals process, judging for major events 
and a long list of national championships -- even though most of those are held 
east of the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Leweck, former commodore of the California Yacht Club and a veteran ocean 
racer, acknowledged: "USYRU probably deserves more financial support. A lot of 
people enjoying the sport probably aren't contributing what they should. But I 
think forcing people to join something is inappropriate and would create an 
adverse reaction to an organization that is helping sailing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Kober of Long Beach, a former USYRU president, suggested discounting 
regatta entry fees for USYRU members as an incentive to join, and added: "The 
people who use the services have to pay their fair share. If it's optional, a 
lot of people just won't pay." 
</P>
<P>
But, mandatory membership? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad idea," said Tom Ehman, who was executive director of USYRU through 
the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting the America's Cup decision from the Appellate Division of the 
New York Supreme Court, Ehman has pursued another of his aims: to throw Olympic 
sailing open to professionals, who have already been accepted in other Olympic 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
He will be in London next month when the subject is addressed by the 
International Yacht Racing Union, from which USYRU and the International 
Olympic Committee will take their lead on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
USYRU has been wrestling with the problem for the last few years without 
managing a takedown. The best it has done is to establish a trust fund system 
in which sailors such as Randy Smyth and John Kolius may deposit their winnings 
to protect their amateur status, then withdraw "expenses." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth quadrennial Whitbread Round the World Race will start Saturday, Sept. 
2 from England, with about two dozen entries. 
</P>
<P>
The 32,932-nautical mile race is to ocean racing what the America's Cup is to 
buoy racing, but it has never created much interest in the U.S., probably 
because it has never touched a North American port, and an American boat has 
never won it. 
</P>
<P>
Past winners have been boats from England in 1974 and '78, Holland in '82 and 
Switzerland in '86. For the first time the race, which takes about nine months, 
will mark one of its six legs in the U.S. Competitors will reach Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., in late April and start the last leg for England on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
It appears there will be only one American entry, a nine-woman crew skippered 
by Nance Frank of Annapolis, Md. Ted Allison of Seattle had hoped to race a 
Santa Cruz 70, but is still short of money. In fact, Frank reportedly has only 
enough funds for the first leg to Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>

Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Ocean Sailing Assn., best known for running the Ensenada Race, will 
conduct one of its other three events Sept. 9-10. The 32nd NOSA Argosy 
overnight race will be from Newport Beach to Cabrillo Beach and return . . . 
The 12th annual Lido Boat Show is scheduled at Newport Beach Sept. 7-10 for 
used boats, Sept. 13-17 for power and sail . . . The Boat Owners Assn. of the 
United States has published a national pamphlet guide to towing companies for 
non-emergency sea service, available free by writing BOAT/U.S. Towing Guide, 
880 S. Pickett St., Alexandria VA 22304. The Southern California contact is TAB 
Marine, which operates the Billy M and monitors VHF Channel 16. The phone 
number is (619) 225-9255 . . . The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a consumer fact 
sheet reminding boaters that it is illegal to dump any type or quantity of 
plastic -- including Styrofoam, straws, fishing line and so-called 
bio-degradables -- anywhere in the marine environment. Maximum penalties are a 
$25,000 civil fine or $50,000 criminal fine.

DRUG LORDS VOW WAR ON COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
4 NEW BOMBINGS BLAMED ON CARTELS; GOVERNMENT INTENSIFIES CRACKDOWN 
</P>

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a renewed wave of terror, bombings and death threats, Colombia's fugitive 
drug lords declared "total and absolute war" on the country's political and 
business leadership Thursday, ominously targeting even the families of those 
who resist them. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer a tomb in Colombia to a jail in the United States," the drug lords 
declared in an inflammatory communique left early Thursday at the site of one 
of four new bombing targets. 
</P>
<P>
One man died in blasts at the Medellin headquarters of Colombia's two leading 
political parties. Another man was injured in one of three other attacks in and 
near Medellin that left the homes of two prominent politicians in flames and 
another pockmarked by bullets. Police said the attacks and the bombings in the 
early morning hours appeared to be coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening the government issued a series of new decrees aimed at 
pressing an official offensive against the drug traffickers. Included in the 
decrees are measures for destroying unauthorized private airstrips and 
disposing of property confiscated from suspected traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All Who Have Persecuted' 
</P>
<P>
The earlier statement from the drug lords said: "We declare total and absolute 
war on the government, the industrial and political oligarchy, the journalists 
who have attacked and outraged us, the judges who have sold themselves to the 
government, high court extraditing judges and presidential and sectorial 
(social, business and labor) associations, and all who have persecuted and 
attacked us." 
</P>
<P>
It was signed "The Extraditables," a group that has been identified in the past 
as the top leadership of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, all of them wanted 
men in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Their warning added that "we will not respect the families of those who have 
not respected our families." 
</P>
<P>
"These people are serious," said a leading Colombian newspaper editor who asked 
to remain unnamed because of the direct threat contained in the drug lords' 
message. "This is the most serious thing I have seen in my life," he added, 
noting that more than a dozen journalists and hundreds of government officials 
have been killed by cartel hit squads here in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revulsion After Assassinations 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's current crackdown against the drug cartels was begun against a 
background of national revulsion following the assassinations last week of an 
appeals court judge, a police chief and a leading presidential candidate who 
had vowed to combat narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the murder Friday of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan as 
he was about to begin a campaign speech, President Virgilio Barco Vargas issued 
emergency decrees allowing extradition of drug suspects to the United States 
and confiscation of their property. Since then, police and military units have 
conducted more than 300 raids, detaining more than 10,000 people and seizing an 
estimated $200 million worth of drug suspects' property. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry spokesman said Thursday that the "great majority" of those 
detained have been released without charges after questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Under one of Thursday's additional decrees, owners will be required to 
personally claim seized properties and prove that they were acquired with 
legitimate funds within 10 days. It is unlikely that suspected traffickers will 
emerge from hiding to make their claims. 
</P>
<P>
If they do not, their properties will be turned over to government agencies for 
redistribution, according to the decree. Farms and ranches will be broken up 
and distributed to landless peasants, urban properties will go to a family 
welfare agency, cash and automobiles will be given to a judicial fund to 
improve court working conditions, and planes and boats will be turned over to 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Another decree requires provincial officials to inventory private airstrips. 
Unauthorized landing strips, often used for cocaine trafficking, will be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The decree also requires distributors of aviation fuel to report to the 
government on their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Under Colombian law, the country's Supreme Court is required to review the 
decrees and rule on their constitutionality within 40 days. One of Thursday's 
decrees provides special protection for justices conducting the review. 
</P>
<P>
An American narcotics expert involved in the government crackdown said 
Thursday's bombings and threats fit the pattern of Medellin cartel behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Cornered' 
</P>
<P>
"We're not surprised," he said. "They are cornered, and their only hope is to 
intimidate and bend the will of the government. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been very good at following through on what they say they will do," 
he said, adding his hope "that the government stands tall to this challenge." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident that if they (the government) can stay in there, they are 
going to win this war," the drug expert said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Bogota, which normally operates under tight security 
measures, appeared Thursday to have heightened its alert. About 100 U.S. 
officials are attached to the embassy, and about two dozen agents of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passer-by Dies 
</P>
<P>
The early morning wave of terror in Medellin, an industrial city of 2 million 
that has long been the headquarters of the biggest drug cartel, began with 
shattering explosions at the headquarters of Galan's faction of the ruling 
Liberal Party and the opposition Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Party office manager Gustavo Garcia said that a passer-by was killed in 
a blast that took the roof off the one-story concrete-and-brick building and 
shattered windows throughout the downtown business block. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, the vacation homes just outside Medellin of former 
Finance Minister Edgard Gutierrez of the Liberal Party and Sen. Ignacio Velez 
Escobar of the Conservative Party were burned down. A third home, that of 
prominent industrialist Augusto Lopez Valencia, a top official of the 
Bavaria-Bouverie industrial conglomerate, was assaulted and shot up by a gang 
of about 10 armed men, according to a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Police also found and defused two suitcase bombs, each containing 22 pounds of 
explosives, at the Medellin stations of the nation's two top radio networks, 
Caracol and RCN, owned by families that are among Colombia's wealthiest. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin drug lords are known to be hostile to the old-money families of 
the industrial city in which they have made their headquarters. Their 
communique warning of attacks against the oligarchy was left with the suitcase 
bomb at the Caracol radio station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destruction Vowed 
</P>
<P>
"We will burn and destroy the industry's properties and mansions of the 
oligarchy," said the threatening statement of the drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat said the warning to "the oligarchy" was clearly meant to 
scare the country's dominant upper classes so that they will press for a 
relaxation of the Barco government's crackdown on the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the target," the diplomat said. "The cartel is saying, 'If you are 
going to play ball with Barco, we're going to hit you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the major drug lords remained a mystery. The 
three top Medellin drug traffickers -- Pablo Escobar, estimated to worth more 
than $3 billion; Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and Jorge Ochoa -- are believed to be 
in hiding somewhere in Colombia, despite reports that they may have fled to 
Panama, according to the American drug expert. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma branded the reports as "false and 
tendentious" in a letter to Barco on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of information of their being in many places," the drug 
expert said. "But my gut feeling is that Escobar is still here in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"My educated guess is they prefer to stay in areas where they feel some sense 
of control, they feel secure. They know if they make a mistake in a third 
country, their chances of being extradited are significant." 
</P>
<P>
The drug expert said that the American legal documents necessary to extradite 
Eduardo Martinez Romero, so-called finance minister of the Medellin cartel, who 
remains the top drug figure arrested since Saturday, are expected to arrive in 
Bogota today, in plenty of time to continue holding him until he can be sent to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under Barco's emergency decree, Martinez would have been eligible for release 
early next week if the U.S. documents failed to arrive on time, the expert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that two other drug figures whom he described as "Class 1, in the same 
class as Pablo Escobar," also face quick extradition. They are Ana Beatriz 
Rodriguez Tamayo and Bernardo Londono Quintero, both under indictment in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
In their threatening communique Thursday, the drug lords sought to portray 
themselves as peace-loving nationalists who had sought in vain to find accord 
with the government but had been persecuted by "anti-nationalists." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Continue Our Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
"We will not lower our flag, and we will continue our struggle and our total 
war against the anti-nationalists and the sellers of the motherland," their 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been asking the government for peace since the talks in Panama in 
1984, when violence could have been avoided," the statement said. It apparently 
referred to a 1984 meeting between cartel representatives and former President 
Alfonso Lopez Michelsen in Panama during which they proposed repatriating $2 
billion a year in return for a blanket amnesty from the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reply we have received from the government has been repression -- the 
arbitrary searches, unjust arrests of our families, the plundering of our 
homes," said the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's government sought to distance itself from actions of 
Israeli citizens in Colombia reported to have trained assassination teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Permit Was Given 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry announced that a firm linked with drug lords in Colombia 
had never received a permit from the government to sell arms or give training 
to anyone in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, Hod Hahanit, a Tel Aviv company that specializes in security and 
military know-how, approached the Defense Ministry a year ago to ask permission 
to do business in Colombia but was turned down, according to the a Defense 
Ministry announcement. It was not clear why permission was withheld. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement went on to say that another, unidentified firm violated 
Defense Ministry controls and worked for clients in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, companies selling weapons or giving military training abroad must be 
licensed by the Defense Ministry. There are an estimated 800 such firms 
operating in scores of countries. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of Hod Hahanit has been identified as Yair Klein, a retired 
Israeli army colonel. Government radio said he was expected to return to the 
country from a trip abroad next week. Government sources in Tel Aviv said that 
between 10 and 12 emloyees of the company had been in Colombia recently and 
left during the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
American television broadcast videotape purporting to show Israeli mercenaries 
training "hit teams" of Colombian drug dealers. Colombian newspapers reported 
that foreigners, including Israelis, may have carried out the recent 
assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential candidate campaigning 
against the drug trade.

DRUG SEEMS TO BLOCK USERS' COCAINE NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A pain-killing drug dramatically reduces the craving for both cocaine and 
heroin and may become an extremely potent tool in the fight against drug abuse, 
Harvard scientists report today in a paper published in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers now use antidepressants to help wean cocaine addicts from 
their addiction, there is now no medication that effectively blocks the craving 
for cocaine, which is regularly used by as many as 3 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard researchers report that buprenorphine, a drug that is already being 
studied for use in treating heroin addiction, almost completely halts 
self-administration of cocaine by rhesus monkeys, which are widely used as a 
model for human drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Anecdotal evidence of scattered human use has suggested that the drug may be 
equally effective in people and researchers are quickly organizing controlled 
studies. The dual action of the drug may be particularly valuable because 70% 
of heroin abusers are also addicted to cocaine, frequently injecting them 
together in a concoction called a "speedball." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also enthusiastic about buprenorphine because it does not 
appear to be addictive and seems to produce no adverse side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Buprenorphine is one of the first fruits of a new, $25-million program by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse to develop anti-cocaine drugs. Two other 
promising new drugs are also being studied in humans, and as many as 28 are 
undergoing animal testing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the kind of drug we set out to find," said Dr. Marvin Snyder, 
director of preclinical research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a real breakthrough," added Dr. Forrest S. Tennant Jr., a 
psychiatrist who operates Community Health Projects Inc. in West Covina. "But 
we have to keep in mind that, unlike heroin abuse or alcohol abuse or smoking, 
which can be treated with a single drug, cocaine addiction will probably have 
to be treated with a variety of agents." 
</P>
<P>
Buprenorphine is now used as an intravenous painkiller during surgery. 
Researchers have recognized for several years that it has potential for 
treating heroin addiction. Dr. Thomas Kosten, a psychiatrist at the Yale 
University School of Medicine, has been studying it in addicts for that purpose 
for three years, comparing it to methadone, an addictive substitute for heroin 
that does not produce a "high." 
</P>
<P>
"We observed that it not only decreased heroin use, but that it also markedly 
decreased cocaine abuse," Kosten said. Although cocaine abuse was not part of 
the controlled study, "We found that people receiving buprenorphine used about 
(one-eighth as much) cocaine as those on methadone." 
</P>
<P>
When six methadone-maintenance patients who were using cocaine heavily were 
switched to buprenorphine, "five stopped completely and one had a 60% 
reduction," Kosten said. 
</P>
<P>
Kosten and his colleagues at Yale have been conducting a controlled study of 
buprenorphine for cocaine abuse for six months, but they do not expect to have 
results for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite excited about the animal study because it tells us we are on the 
right track," Kosten said. 
</P>
<P>
The new study was conducted by Nancy K. Mello, a psychologist, and Dr. Jack H. 
Mendelson, a psychiatrist, at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., where they 
operate Harvard's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mello, Mendelson and their colleagues fitted six rhesus monkeys with an 
implanted tube that allowed the animals to infuse themselves with cocaine by 
pulling on a lever. "It's important that we don't give cocaine to the monkeys. 
They administer it themselves," Mendelson said in a telephone interview. "There 
is no reward for using it and no punishment if they don't." 
</P>
<P>
The monkeys had a second implanted tube that allowed the researchers to infuse 
either a salt solution or a solution of buprenorphine. When the salt solution 
was infused, the monkeys typically administered an average of 30 cocaine 
injections per day, an amount per body weight comparable to that consumed by 
human heavy abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Administration of buprenorphine caused the monkeys to simply lose interest in 
cocaine. By the end of 30 days of treatment, the monkeys were injecting 
cocaine, on average, only about twice daily. The researchers are not sure how 
the drug reduces the craving for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Mendelson said, buprenorphine did not alter the animals' 
behavior or their consumption of food. 
</P>
<P>
Two other medications called flupenthixol and carbamazapine also show great 
promise in reducing cocaine craving. Flupenthixol, which has been used in 
Europe for about 10 years as an antidepressant, is not available yet in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Gawin, a psychiatrist at Yale, tried it on 10 cocaine users in the 
Bahamas who had not responded to other treatments and observed a dramatic 
reduction in cocaine use. The Yale group hopes to begin clinical trials with 
the medication within a month if they can get permission from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles P. O'Brien, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania, has 
had similar, preliminary results with an anti-epileptic drug called 
carbamazapine, and he is beginning more rigorous double-blind studies in which 
neither the physicians nor their patients know what medication the drug abusers 
are receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also looking at new ways to administer the anti-cocaine drugs 
to ensure that patients continue to take them. One promising approach involves 
"depots," biodegradable plastic pellets that would be injected under the skin 
and slowly release the medications over a period of weeks. The depots would 
eliminate the abuser's need for a daily trip to a clinic to receive treatment, 
a factor that many feel has deterred abusers from seeking treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Mendelson and others cautioned that medications alone will be insufficient in 
curing cocaine abuse. "There's no magic bullet for curing drug abuse," he said. 
Psychotherapy and social counseling will also be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Medications such as buprenorphine, he said, will simply provide a "window of 
opportunity" that will allow time for other therapies to take effect.

OVERWHELMING VOTE ENDORSES POLISH PREMIER

With an overwhelming vote and a standing ovation from the lower house of 
Parliament, Tadeusz Mazowiecki on Thursday became prime minister of Poland and 
the first opposition figure to head an East European government. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, 62, a gaunt-faced, soft-spoken adviser to the Solidarity free trade 
union movement, was elected by a vote of 378 to 4, with 41 abstentions, 
indicating that he received strong support even from some of the 173 Communists 
in the Sejm, as the lower house is called. 
</P>
<P>
The scene seemed genuinely moving to Mazowiecki, who sat by himself off to the 
side of the Speaker's rostrum while the vote was counted. 
</P>
<P>
When the vote was announced, the deputies rose to their feet, applauding. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very touched at this moment," Mazowiecki said. "I am counting on 
cooperation with the Sejm and the Senate. . . . This moment shall become an 
essential moment for us to raise up Poland together." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the former Communist government crossed the platform and led 
Mazowiecki over to the outgoing prime minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, the 
first of a dozen Communist officials to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Mazowiecki was surrounded by his old Solidarity allies, many of 
them veterans, like him, of prison terms imposed by the Communists, who have 
now been forced to step aside. Mazowiecki, a close Solidarity adviser since the 
movement was formed in August, 1980, spent a year in prison during the 
crackdown that followed the imposition of martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, Mazowiecki met for 30 minutes with the official who made 
the martial-law declaration, President Wojciech Jaruzelski. It was Jaruzelski 
who accepted Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's plan for a Solidarity-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you success in your responsible mission, because Poland needs this 
success," Jaruzelski told Mazowiecki as the two men shook hands for 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"This success is only possible with your help," Mazowiecki replied. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, who engineered Solidarity's drive to form a government, was ecstatic 
when he met reporters in Gdansk after the vote was taken in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
"I will do everything so that my premier -- my child, our child -- passes the 
test before society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, he called the election "an event without 
precedent" and wished Mazowiecki success in "transforming our country from a 
totalitarian system to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subdued Reaction in Moscow 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri A. Gremitsky indicated that 
the Kremlin's reaction was calm. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet side takes the decision into account," he said, "and we shall 
regard Comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in the relations that link our two 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki has repeated Walesa's earlier pledges, obviously aimed at placating 
Moscow, that a Solidarity government has no intention of pulling back from its 
commitment to the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led defense alliance. Walesa agreed 
with Jaruzelski that Communist ministers would be left in charge of the Defense 
and Interior ministries, which deal with military and police affairs. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mazowiecki suggested that Communists would be appointed to other 
ministries as well, although he did not specify how many. "The Communist Party 
in isolation could be a trap for the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport, Me., where he is spending a summer vacation, President Bush 
said in a written statement that the political developments in Poland "hold 
promise not only for a peaceful democratic transition in Poland but also for a 
broader process of European reconciliation, toward a Europe whole and free." 
</P>
<P>
Bush congratulated Mazowiecki, offering him assurances of "our strong support," 
and saluted Jaruzelski "for his political wisdom in endorsing a government 
reflecting the genuine will of the Polish people." He also saluted Solidarity 
"for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
In a further signal of the rapid change in Poland, a group of 15 Communist 
deputies in the Sejm submitted a proposal to drop from the constitution a 
paragraph that designates the Communist Party as the "leading force" in Polish 
society. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech before the vote was taken, Mazowiecki said he intends to form 
a government "capable of acting for the good of society, the nation and the 
state. It will be a government of a coalition for a thorough reform of the 
state. . . . One has to restore to Poland the mechanism of normal political 
life. The principle of struggle . . . must be replaced with the principle of 
partnership. We will not pass from a totalitarian system to a democratic one in 
any other way." 
</P>
<P>
He said the state "cannot take care of everything and guarantee everything." 
The state's most important role, he said, "is opening possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
He added that his government would support a market-oriented economy, 
declaring, "Poland cannot afford ideological experiments any longer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoids Media Issue 
</P>
<P>
At a jammed news conference after his meeting with Jaruzelski, Mazowiecki 
avoided direct answers on some questions, such as whether he would act to 
remove Communists from control of Poland's television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that radio and television should be open," he said. "We will 
speak by facts." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to have a government formed by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
He said his first messages of congratulations had come from the prime ministers 
of France and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he had heard from Pope John Paul II, he deferred his answer until 
the end of the news conference. Then he said the next item on his agenda was to 
place a call to the Pope. After that, he said, he intended to call Walesa.

DELAY URGED IN ASSIGNED RISK CAR POLICY RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staff attorneys of the state Insurance Department urged Thursday that a 
proposed 112.3% average increase in auto insurance rates for more than a 
million drivers insured under California's assigned risk plan be indefinitely 
delayed pending a restructuring of the plan to include a special rate for 
low-income drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The call for delay in implementing even part of the increase came after 
representatives of a coalition of 15 minority groups testified at a Los Angeles 
hearing that, if it were adopted, rates as high as $2,187 a year for minimum 
liability insurance in south, east and central areas of Los Angeles could 
require many families to pay more for insurance than they do for food. The 
statewide average rate would be about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Such "exorbitant" charges would force as many as 400,000 people to drop their 
insurance and run the risk of a jail term if they later had their licenses 
suspended for failure to comply with the state's mandatory insurance law and 
still continued to drive, said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates Inc., 
representing the minority coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Department attorney Judith Mulroy said the department staff concurs 
with the minority coalition that implementing such a high rate would defeat the 
original purpose of the California Assigned Risk Plan, which is to serve as an 
insurer of last resort for those who cannot find coverage elsewhere. She said 
it would drive the cost of such coverage beyond the reach of many. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroy assailed the Assigned Risk Governing Board, a group made up mostly of 
insurance company executives that administers the plan, for failing to come up 
with any creative solutions to deal with this problem. 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that a low-lifeline rate be established, similar to that in 
telephone service. Unless such "fundamental changes" are instituted, she said, 
"a doubling of the rates is not justified." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who was present at the hearing, did 
not directly react to the staff suggestion. In an opening series of comments, 
the commissioner said the assigned risk system is "riddled with problems" that 
the governing board has done nothing about. "No one is at the helm of the 
plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, she said, she feels obligated to represent the majority 
of the state's policyholders, who through their regular policies are paying now 
to subsidize losses in the assigned risk plan. Attorneys for the insurers 
suggested Thursday that this subsidy may run as high as $75 per car this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the assigned risk system, insurers doing business in California are 
required to accept a quota of drivers who either cannot get insurance or who 
choose not to buy regular coverage. The quotas are linked to how much auto 
insurance business each company does in the state. If the companies lose money 
on these policies, then their other customers may be required to pay higher 
premiums to pay for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers' attorneys claimed Thursday that the statewide deficit on assigned 
risk coverage will amount to $600 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Gillespie, aware that pushing assigned risk rates too high 
would cause many motorists to do without insurance, has been holding these 
rates down in the urban areas. In Los Angeles, the result has been that 
assigned risk coverage is often less expensive than regular coverage. Gillespie 
has routinely cut way back on rate increase requests, and in the present case, 
delayed even hearing the request for more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
All this has led both to a swelling of the numbers of assigned risk customers 
and of the insurers' claimed losses on such customers. Meanwhile, a whole 
industry of brokerage firms that sell only assigned risk policies has been 
spawned. There have been allegations also of rampant fraud in assigned risk 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gillespie and Gnaizda, the minority coalition attorney, accused the 
Assigned Risk Governing Board on Thursday of putting in for its 112% average 
rate increase (it would be 137% in Central Los Angeles) without any regard for 
the social ramifications. But Gnaizda put it more dramatically than Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal comes from archaic actuarial charts, not from human hearts," 
Gnaizda stated. "It is callously and socially irresponsible. It will wreak 
human havoc." 
</P>
<P>
And, he went on, the worst is yet to come. If actuarial projections are borne 
out, the insurers will be asking permission to charge $6,000 a year to Central 
Los Angeles drivers by 1994 and $16,000 by 1999, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
If even the current rate increase is granted, "you will face a public revolt 
that will make Propositions 103 and 13 pale by comparison," Gnaizda told the 
hearing. Proposition 103 was the landmark insurance initiative approved by the 
electorate last November. Proposition 13, the Jarvis property tax cut, was 
approved in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Just say no," Gnaizda urged Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers' attorney, James R. Woods, by contrast, insisted that it is 
against state law to do anything but make the plan self-sufficient. He said, 
however, that the assigned risk board had held its rate increase request below 
what is now needed to make that happen.

ASSEMBLY OKS RESOLUTION ON INTERNMENT AFTER SKIRMISH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Igniting acrimonious debate, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) on 
Thursday attacked a resolution calling for California schoolchildren to be 
taught that the Japanese internment during World War II was a violation of 
human rights, not an act of military necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and veteran of three wars, 
touched an angry nerve among his colleagues when he stood during a full 
Assembly session and shouted his objections to a resolution that blamed the 
internment on "race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind you saying that it was a failure of political leadership for 
Franklin Roosevelt," he said in a slap at the Democrats, "but what you're 
saying is that the brave men and women of this country -- your fathers and 
mothers and your grandfathers -- were a bunch of racists. And that's why they 
did this." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course they made a bad decision," Ferguson said. "It was a terrible thing 
to do. But 50 years (later), sitting in this chamber, when the biggest risk in 
your lives is getting reelected or safe sex, what right do you have to question 
the motives of your fathers and mothers and your grandfathers and uncles?" 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's objections touched off an unusually emotional verbal skirmish, 
during which fellow lawmakers ganged up on the Orange County conservative and 
accused him of trying to whitewash history. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest condemnation came from Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento), whose wife was placed in a Japanese internment camp when she 
was 4-years-old. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to say that your opinion is contemptible and I will not," Isenberg 
said in a tight voice. "I will say this: It is deeply offensive to every single 
piece of what this country is about and you should be ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
The fight was over a non-binding resolution, sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie 
Speier (D-South San Francisco), that calls on school officials and textbook 
manufacturers to revise accounts of the internment and describe it as a mass 
violation of human rights. Such an "accurate and objective" account of how the 
government imprisoned 110,000 Japanese would omit the traditional excuse of 
national security, the resolution says. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly gave final approval to the resolution by a bare 41-10 vote in the 
80-member body, with most Democrats voting for it and many Republicans 
abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Ferguson -- perhaps best known for his attempts to have 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a former anti-Vietnam War 
demonstrator, declared a traitor and ousted from the Assembly -- stood up to 
ask for a one-week postponement so he could rally veterans groups against the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming he was "sick of this liberal trashing of America," Ferguson fumed at 
what he said was the ungrateful second-guessing of his younger peers. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps all of the 17- and 18-year-old kids who joined and fought for you, 
that was the dumbest decision we ever made, maybe," said Ferguson, a veteran of 
World War II, Korea and Vietnam. "Maybe by now you'd all be speaking Japanese 
or maybe you'd all be speaking German by now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Carefully Worded' 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we did make some dumb decisions, but who are you to sit here and call 
your parents racist because they made a decision that they thought was 
important and needed at the time?" 
</P>
<P>
Speier parried Ferguson's objections by pointing out that her resolution was 
"carefully worded" to reflect the findings of a special federal commission 
convened by former President Reagan to study the Japanese internment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're saying to our young people is, 'Yes, we do make mistakes,' Mr. 
Ferguson," Speier said. "We have made mistakes in many wars. We make mistakes 
every single day of our lives and we can't be ashamed of that fact." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the roll call by which the Assembly voted final passage of the Japanese 
internment resolution on Thursday, 41 to 10: 
</P>
<P>
Democrats for (39): Bane, Bates, Brown, Burton, Calderon, Campbell, Chacon,

FEINSTEIN INSISTS SHE HAS FIRE FOR GOVERNOR'S RUN 
</P>

Shaken by her resigned campaign manager's charge that she lacks spunk and 
energy, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein tried to jump-start her 
gubernatorial race Thursday by vowing to run hard until election day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the race to stay. I'm motivated. I have the will and commitment to 
win," the Democrat insisted in an opening statement to reporters. Replying 
later to questions, she asserted: "People who know me know that I'm not lazy. 
They know that I'm a disciplined person. I have never quit a race. I've been in 
eight races . . . . I'm a good campaigner. I enjoy it out on the stump." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that an established politician -- a veteran office holder -- would 
feel compelled to make such statements and offer such assurances is an 
indication of the severity of the wound inflicted by the resignation of her 
longtime campaign manager, Clinton Reilly of San Francisco. Reilly quit 
unexpectedly on Monday with a bitter accusation -- echoing publicly what many 
politicos long had been contending privately -- that Feinstein lacks the 
so-called "fire in the belly" necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to that charge with some humor on Thursday, and referring to a recent 
hysterectomy that had sidelined her for six weeks, Feinstein said: "I just had 
fire in my belly and had it removed." 
</P>
<P>
But she displayed no humor when discussing Reilly: "Mr. Reilly and I had 
differences over the management of the campaign. He chose to leave. I am free 
at last." 
</P>
<P>
It was learned, meanwhile, that Feinstein is considering hiring the veteran Los 
Angeles-based political consulting firm of Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino 
to devise campaign strategy and develop television commercials. BAD -- as the 
firm calls itself -- would be considered a particular asset in Southern 
California, where Feinstein is weakest. But the former mayor also has been in 
contact with another consultant, Robert Squier of Washington D.C., a source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Named as the day-to-day campaign manager was Darry Sragow, who directed U.S. 
Sen. Alan Cranston's successful reelection effort in 1986 and Lt. Gov. Leo 
McCarthy's losing race for the U.S. Senate last year. Sragow had been 
Feinstein's Southern California coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
One of the raps on Reilly within the Feinstein organization was that he 
insisted on being in charge of everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely determined to run this campaign on a plain-speaking, direct 
basis," Feinstein told reporters. "I'm absolutely determined that I'm not going 
to be handled, that I'm not going to be merchandised." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate her commitment to the contest, Feinstein announced that as of 
Thursday she had elevated her campaign from the "exploratory" stage to a 
full-blown race -- a subtle distinction that usually matters only to 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
She described herself as pro-choice on abortion, somebody willing to raise more 
revenue to fight crime, an education reformist and a devoted environmentalist 
-- a governor who would "guarantee" there would not be any offshore oil 
drilling "if I've got to go out and lie in front of those derricks myself." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also spent much of Wednesday and Thursday huddling with Democratic 
legislators, many of whom have no love-loss for her opponent for the party's 
gubernatorial nomination, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. The attorney general 
angered lawmakers recently by proposing a "political reform" initiative that 
would, among other things, limit the terms of legislators. He called state 
government and the Legislature a "swamp." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein seemed to take pains at her press conference to praise legislators 
for taking "a major step forward" with a political ethics package of their own. 
She also said she opposed placing a limit on the terms of office holders. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who had lunch Thursday with 
Feinstein, told a reporter that the former mayor had a falling out with Reilly 
because of "her desire to be her own spokesperson, her desire to control her 
own money and control her campaign. . . . Too often, these campaign 
manager-types turn candidates into clones. Dianne could not be turned into a 
clone." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who met with 
Feinstein in his office on Wednesday, said he advised her to make a strong 
statement of commitment to the race, "to let the world know that she's 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "She had a serious operation. And when you've had a serious operation 
you are not out campaigning. It's incredible to me that people are asking 
'where was she?' " 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she now intends to spend her "total time" campaigning and 
raising money. She plans to move to Los Angeles for the duration of the 
campaign by the end of the month, Sragow said.

CHINA TO SEND MANY RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES TO LOW-LEVEL RURAL JOBS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a crackdown aimed at enforcing ideological discipline on China's 
restive youth, recent university graduates holding positions with the central 
government are to be transferred to low-level provincial or rural jobs for up 
to two years, according to Chinese sources. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer order, reminiscent of the massive exile to the countryside of 
intellectuals and some factions of the youthful Red Guards in the late 1960s, 
is said to be intended to increase awareness of China's economic and social 
realities among the nation's future elite. 
</P>
<P>
But the new regulations -- which are to apply to all people working in 
government or Communist Party jobs at the national level who graduated in or 
after 1985 -- also provide a method of demanding ideological orthodoxy from 
members of a generation that generally favors rapid relaxation of political 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that the order may be selectively enforced, with the 
harshest consequences falling on those perceived as critical of the hard-line 
leaders now in control of China's government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Backed Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Many young employees of central government ministries supported the 
pro-democracy student demonstrations that took place in Beijing this spring. 
The protests were suppressed with hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths the 
weekend of June 3-4 when the Chinese army was ordered to clear demonstrators 
from Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
One Chinese official, quoted this week by the Hongkong Standard in an article 
about the new policy, said that job prospects "after working at the grass-roots 
level for two or three years" will depend "on their work and, most importantly, 
their political stand." 
</P>
<P>
Young people will be judged for promotion at the end of this period largely on 
whether they have displayed support for the principles of socialism and 
Communist Party rule, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The order, which has been passed to government and party institutions over the 
last several weeks, has provoked intense anxiety among many of those likely to 
be affected by it. Some of the people ordered to grass-roots-level jobs are 
expected to be required to transfer their residence registration from Beijing 
to provincial towns. It can be extremely difficult to regain official 
permission to live in the capital, or in other major cities, having once lost 
urban registration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Still in Countryside 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Red Guards sent to the countryside in the late 1960s have now 
returned to their cities of birth, a significant minority have never been able 
to get approval to move back. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new order, it appears that most of those sent to new jobs will work 
in lower-level government or enterprise offices, or in factories. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether any of the recent college graduates will be ordered to 
work alongside peasants in villages, but some of those who are aware of the 
order fear that this could happen. 
</P>
<P>
One young employee made half-joking reference to these fears when the new order 
was announced to a group of workers in a central government office. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, we'll protect you -- we'll say you're a 1984 graduate," the 
employee's older colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Raising Pigs at 60 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right," the more recent graduate said, in an attempt to be 
lighthearted. "I can see myself when I'm 60 years old, raising pigs and being 
the village party leader." 
</P>
<P>
But after drinking beer at a party later that evening, this same person broke 
into tears and said: "What's the point in living? I can't go on anymore. If I'm 
sent to a village, I can't go on living." 
</P>
<P>
It has long been part of Chinese Communist ideology that intellectuals should 
increase their sense of unity with the masses by performing manual labor. This 
principle was carried to an extreme during the chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural 
Revolution, when not only student Red Guards but educated people of all 
professions and many Communist Party officials were required to perform manual 
labor in factories or work in the countryside planting rice and raising pigs. 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, China's leaders have held that educated people must be 
allowed to concentrate on developing technical skills to contribute to the 
nation's modernization. But there have also been periodic attempts at promoting 
the idea that technical competence must be combined with political reliability. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, education officials made plans to require all college 
graduates to spend a year at grass-roots-level jobs before joining central 
government agencies, but the rule was never enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations to enforce the new order appear to be moving forward. This week's 
edition of Culture News, published by the Ministry of Culture, said that 
college graduates assigned to work in the ministry must first join in special 
study sessions and then spend one to two years working in state-run enterprises 
under the ministry's control. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry newspaper said that the residence registration of the recent 
graduates will be transfered from Beijing to their new places of employment and 
that those who do not perform well will not be able to return to ministry jobs 
in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar order announced earlier this month applying to another category of 
young people, the State Education Commission ruled that most of this year's 
college graduates who intend to pursue post-graduate study must spend one or 
two years working before resuming their studies.

CONTRA TRIBUNAL AFFIRMS CONVICTION OF REBEL CHIEFTAIN ACCUSED OF MURDER

A Nicaraguan rebel appeals tribunal upheld the conviction of one commander, 
exonerated another officer and reduced charges against four others in a 
torture-murder case, a Contra spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six Contras were given dishonorable discharges -- the stiffest 
penalty that can be handed out by a Contra internal court system that was set 
up in 1987. Leniency was recommended for one and another was freed of the 
charges, according to a document obtained by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra tribunal, made up of four lawyers living in Miami, issued a lengthy 
statement, finding that rebel commander Isaac Blacker Hurtado, known as 
Israelita, "had the premeditated intention of murdering Managua 2," the nom de 
guerre for the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
Managua 2 was suspected of being an agent of Nicaragua's Sandinista government. 
The six Contras were charged last March by a Contra court in connection with 
his death and several rapes in northern Nicaragua. The United States pressed 
for the investigation.

MANAGUA ACCUSES 13 IN ARMED FORCES OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government, stung by international criticism of its 
counterinsurgency methods, has brought murder charges against 13 Sandinista 
soldiers, security agents and paramilitary gunmen in the deaths of seven 
unarmed civilians suspected of aiding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
In a quiet admission of revolutionary power gone awry, nine of the gunmen have 
been sentenced in recent weeks to prison terms ranging from six to 30 years, 
two are on trial and two others are being sought, according to an unpublished 
Sandinista report to the New York-based human rights group Americas Watch. 
</P>
<P>
The official account is challenged, however, by witnesses who say they have 
seen two of the convicted officers still on duty. The government insists they 
are both behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Americas Watch has repeatedly denounced a "pattern of 
summary executions by government forces" in Nicaragua and listed evidence of 51 
killings and the disappearance of 13 persons in Sandinista custody. 
</P>
<P>
The government's reply early this month, its most substantial effort to clarify 
these cases, coincides with well-publicized Sandinista moves to end the war by 
freeing Contra prisoners and offering amnesty and farm land to rebel soldiers 
under an Aug. 7 Central American peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
"It proves that impunity is not the norm here," Wilma Nunez Escorcia, president 
of the government's Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights, said this week in an interview. "A government that punishes violators 
of human rights cannot itself be called a violator." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the U.S.-backed Contra movement, which faces the loss of its 
sanctuaries in Honduras by Dec. 5 under the peace accord, are telling their 
11,000 followers that security agents might harass or even kill them, as a 
result of Sandinista policy or indiscipline, if they return to Nicaragua 
unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
While the still-unfinished murder investigations appear to offer a test of both 
sides' assertions, the results so far are inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Zonal Impact 
</P>
<P>
Because the convictions were not announced publicly, they have made little 
impact in the northern rural war zones where the killings occurred. And the 
reported sightings of convicted men on the loose have cast doubt on the 
intention of the trials. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking officer tried, Lt. Francisco Gonzalez Siles, was sentenced 
July 17 to the maximum 30-year prison term for the separate killings last fall 
of farmers Adrian Zeledon and Miguel Angel Ramirez Davila in a hamlet near 
Pantasma, where Gonzalez Siles worked for the Interior Ministry's state 
security office. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of both victims said this week they were not aware that the officer, 
known and feared in the region as "Chico Tiro," had been found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
And when President Daniel Ortega went to war-divided Pantasma on Aug. 15 for a 
conciliatory speech to the nation, promising the release of about 1,200 jailed 
Contra collaborators in the coming weeks, five farmers said they saw Gonzalez 
Siles supervising a presidential security contingent north of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really believe that justice will be done," said Rosalina Flores de 
Zeledon, widow of one of the victims. "How could it be? The Sandinistas really 
were pleased with Chico Tiro's work." 
</P>
<P>
The top Sandinista official in Pantasma, Reynaldo Guadamuz, insisted that 
Gonzalez Siles has been imprisoned since his arrest last month. Nunez said 
Thursday: "I have rechecked with the military prosecutor. All those convicted 
have to be in jail." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor began investigating the killings near Pantasma and elsewhere, 
Americas Watch was told, within days after The Times reported them last April. 
</P>
<P>
The news accounts, based on testimony gathered by reporters and by Americas 
Watch, tied most of the killings to a campaign to break up the Contras' 
civilian support networks in northern Nicaragua after most of the rebel troops 
had retreated to Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Both Pantasma victims were seized near their farmhouses, marched to remote 
jungle clearings and executed. Juan Ramon Mairena Chavarria, identified as an 
army agent, was sentenced to 15 years for the fatal stabbing of Zeledon under 
Gonzalez Siles' orders. 
</P>
<P>
A local state security chief, Aran Molina Perez, and a subordinate, Felix Pedro 
Jarquin, were sentenced to 16 years each for strangling an alleged Contra 
messenger, Sergio Molina Monje, near Rio Blanco. Two other agents and two of 
the paramilitary gunmen received eight-year terms as accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez said that all three murders were clear examples of abuse of authority in 
counterinsurgency operations. She said the others were less so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6-Year Sentence 
</P>
<P>
In one, Sandinista soldier Luis Concepcion Arauz Flores was sentenced to six 
years for killing a man with whom he had "a very personal enmity" before five 
witnesses near the town of Quilali, she said. Americas Watch reported that 
witnesses had seen Arauz on duty after he was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
In two other cases, in Apantillo and Wiwili, investigators identified the 
killers as civilians, even though they wore military uniforms and had often 
been seen on military patrols. They are on trial in civilian courts. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the Apantillo execution, of Roman Catholic lay preacher Felicito 
Peralta, told Americas Watch that a state security official widely suspected in 
that village as the man who ordered it had been absolved after two weeks in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Two former soldiers are being sought in one of five other killings in Apantillo 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven cases listed by Americas Watch were closed without any criminal charges, 
Nunez said, because the victims were shot in cross-fire or while trying to 
escape, or because evidence against the defendants was weak. Three people 
listed as missing turned up alive. Investigations are under way in 41 remaining 
cases and 10 are "nearly complete," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Mendez, executive director of Americas Watch, said the official account 
proved the pattern of abuses his organization had denounced, even though the 
Sandinistas rejected overall responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have succeeded in making the government realize the importance of 
this problem," he said. "This is an encouraging first step. We are getting 
preliminary reports that the killings themselves have stopped. That is even 
more encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Mendez expressed concern that some of those punished might still be on duty and 
said he expects investigations of pending cases to continue. But he emphasized 
that Americas Watch is getting better cooperation from the Sandinistas than 
from "some other countries in the region," which he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Tomas Borge has agreed to open Nicaragua's jails for 
inspection by human rights groups next week to settle a dispute over how many 
prisoners are held on security charges. He put the number at 1,440; opposition 
groups estimate 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to free most Contra fighters and collaborators while 
jailing Sandinistas for wartime abuses has caused resentment within the ruling 
party. It is apparently to minimize such strains that the recent trials have 
not been publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"Chico Tiro is a comrade who has risked his life during years of war, and now 
he is paying for the errors he is accused of," Guadamuz said of his convicted 
subordinate in Pantasma. "On the other side, there are Contra chiefs who have 
killed, and they are about to go free. This is inconceivable. We are putting 
our own people in jail and letting the enemy out."

COMPLICATIONS FEARED IN DRUG EXTRADITIONS 
</P>

<P>
Justice Department officials are now concerned that the process for extraditing 
Colombian drug kingpins for trial in the United States could prove much more 
complicated and less certain than first indicated by Colombian President 
Virgilio Barco Vargas' emergency decree. 
</P>
<P>
Although the top aide to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh insisted Thursday that the 
Administration is still optimistic, some law enforcement officials involved in 
the extradition effort fear that the new Colombian conditions could hamstring 
the process and sap the ability or even the will of Colombian officials to 
follow through. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's executive assistant, said his "hope and 
expectation" is to have the paper work on Eduardo Martinez Romero, accused of 
money laundering for the Medellin Cartel, in the hands of Colombian authorities 
by the close of business today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking everything at face value and have no reason to believe we will 
get anything but a positive result," Ross said in an interview. But noting that 
Barco's extradition decree is subject to review by the Colombian Supreme Court, 
which is free to act any time, he added: "Only time will tell."

Barco issued the decree last week after Colombian drug terrorists assassinated 
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan and a police chief who had campaigned 
against cocaine trafficking. The decree provided for extradition of Colombian 
drug suspects sought in the United States. However, elaborate fine print 
contained in a separate document titled "Lista de los Pasos para Extraditar" 
(List of the Steps for Extradition) specified conditions that could pose 
serious roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the conditions raise questions about Colombian leaders' 
sincerity in promising firm action against cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
As examples of the potential hurdles, they noted that each extradition request 
now must be approved by the foreign minister, the minister of justice and the 
six ministers who make up the national council on dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Papers Required 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States had pending about 60 U.S. extradition requests for 
drug fugitives believed to be in Colombia, the decree required that fresh 
documentation be provided for each individual sought for trial here. The 
required documentation ranges from fingerprints and photographic identification 
to a certified copy of the penal code allegedly violated. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law enforcement authorities said that fingerprints on some of the 
suspects wanted may not be available or may have come from intelligence sources 
that prevent their being provided to the Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
The procedural conditions also provide that individuals extradited could be 
sentenced to no more than 30 years -- a potential problem under stiffened U.S. 
drug laws, some of which provide for life sentences without possibility of 
parole, one source noted. Suspects apprehended would also be able to appeal the 
proceedings, potentially delaying them while the Colombian high court reviews 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
"At best, we're taking a wait-and-see attitude," one official said of the 
decree. "At worst, you can say we're cynical." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, acknowledging that "the slate is wiped clean" on previously submitted 
U.S. extradition requests, said: "We're inventorying and reviewing the old 
applications to see what we can salvage." 
</P>
<P>
He described translation of the required papers as "a tedious, time-consuming 
and difficult process" but added: "I don't think we have any option but to push 
ahead. . . . Obviously, there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we think we're in good shape. We're working very hard to get the 
documents in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Monica de Greiff, Colombia's minister of justice, said Tuesday that there is "a 
50-50 chance" that the Supreme Court or the general prosecutor will void 
Barco's decree and bar any extraditions. In 1987, the court threw out 
Colombia's formal extradition treaty with the United States, citing legal 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said that after the Justice Department submits the required documents on 
Martinez, it may seek the return of Bernardo Londono Quintero, an alleged 
cocaine trade pioneer who was arrested by Colombian authorities Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ross, Justice Department officials are trying to ascertain that a 
valid warrant exists for Londono Quintero, who is nicknamed "the Diplomat."

U.S. SEEKS 9 DRUG KINGPINS WHO ARE FACING CHARGES IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal authorities in Washington and California said Thursday that they would 
like to extradite at least nine Colombians, including reputed Medellin cartel 
drug baron Pablo Escobar, to the United States to face drug charges if the 
suspects are captured. 
</P>
<P>
All are wanted for prosecution in Los Angeles, San Francisco or Sacramento on 
previous drug indictments or because they escaped from federal prisons in this 
area after being convicted on drug charges elsewhere, the officials said. All 
have lived in Colombia, but federal authorities said they could not determine 
their current whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess said a federal grand jury here 
indicted Escobar and Hugo Obando Ochoa, also a suspected member of the cartel, 
on Sept. 14, 1987. Along with numerous other defendants, they were charged with 
conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine; conspiracy to defraud the United 
States; unlawful use of communication facilities for narcotics trafficking 
activities, and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments were issued after an undercover "sting" called Operation 
Pisces, a money laundering investigation conducted in Los Angeles and other 
cities. Jesus Anibal Zapata, a leader of the Medellin drug cartel, was 
convicted last April in federal court here on 14 charges stemming from the 
Pisces investigation and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Other 
defendants also have been convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Feess said his office also would like to prosecute Reinaldo Mafla Rios, a 
suspected member of the Cali drug cartel, who was indicted here in 1987, and 
charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, money laundering and 
other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Justice Department sources said they would like to extradite to 
Los Angeles Juan Luis Mangas, who escaped from the federal prison camp at 
Lompoc in 1982, just after beginning a five-year sentence for possessing and 
distributing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Justice Department would like to extradite four Colombians to 
San Francisco: Hernando Arana, Enrique Otoya Tobon, Carlos Ignacio Escallon 
Villa and Lenin Francisco Molano. 
</P>
<P>
Arana and Otoya Tobon have been fugitives for seven years after they were 
indicted in a major cocaine case that also involved a plot to assassinate U.S. 
District Judge Robert Aguilar of San Jose. The lead defendant in the case, 
Roberto Gomez Soto, a Cuban national, is serving a life sentence for drug 
trafficking and conspiring to murder Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
Also wanted in California is Irma Jaramillo, convicted of drug trafficking in 
1981. He fled the country in 1984 after an alleged parole violation, according 
to drug agents. 
</P>
<P>

Sacramento, contributed to this story.

HUNGARY HELPS E. GERMANS MOVE TO WEST;

BUDAPEST GRANTS MORE THAN 100 'HUMANITARIAN' EXIT PERMITS

<P>
More than 100 East German refugees, granted "humanitarian" exit permits by the 
Hungarian government, arrived in West Germany on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans had been holed up in the West German Embassy in Budapest for 
the past 11 days, refusing to get out until they were granted permission to 
leave for the West. Their presence in Budapest had caused considerable friction 
between Hungary and East Germany, with the West German government caught in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that Hungary's approval of the East Germans' departure -- 
via chartered plane to Vienna, with documents issued by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, and then by bus to a camp near Nuremberg -- would 
not improve relations between East Germany and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Holdouts 
</P>
<P>
The refugees were the last holdouts in the West German Embassy in Budapest when 
Bonn ordered the embassy closed because of overcrowding. Bonn had done the same 
thing with its missions in East Berlin two weeks ago and in Prague on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary indicated that its action was a special case, worked out in 
negotiations with the West German government and the Red Cross in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Hungary does not let East Germans leave on West German passports 
issued in Budapest, on the grounds that there is no entry stamp in the 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
Under the West German constitution, all East Germans are entitled to West 
German citizenship, but the West German passport does not guarantee passage out 
of a Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
800 Camped on Border 
</P>
<P>
At present, about 800 East Germans are camped out in Budapest trying to find a 
way out to the West. Hundreds of others, "on vacation" in Hungary, have 
congregated near the Austrian border hoping to cross there because of relaxed 
frontier controls. 
</P>
<P>
Across the border in Austria, tourists have been gathering to watch and cheer 
the fleeing East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 East Germans have reached Austria from Hungary since May, when the 
Budapest regime began dismantling the wire fences that define the border with 
Austria. Another 5,000 are said to have been caught by Hungarian border guards 
and sent home. 
</P>
<P>
In Budapest on Thursday, officials said Hungarian frontier guards stopped 
hundreds of East Germans from crossing into Austria the day before. Under an 
agreement with East Germany, Hungary is required to stop people from crossing 
into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Ban Reported 
</P>
<P>
The East German government on Thursday denied a report in the West German 
newspaper Die Welt that East Germans would be prohibited from taking vacations 
in Hungary as of Sept. 1 because of the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
"The East German leadership will, in the future, treat Hungary like a Western 
foreign country for travel purposes," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
But an East German spokesman said that travel to Hungary would continue to be 
permitted. Every year, about 2 million East Germans go to Hungary for 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
The East German government accused the West of engaging in "trade in human 
beings, and people are being illegally shipped out." 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the West German government said that "efforts for a practical solution 
for those East Germans still in Hungary and wanting to emigrate will continue." 
But West German officials admitted that they expect no improvement in the 
status of East Germans seeking refuge in West German missions in East Berlin 
and Prague.

LEBANON'S RIVAL SHIITE FORCES UNITE AGAINST FRENCH

Rival Shiite Muslim militias said Thursday that they had united against a 
French naval force off Lebanon, and the radical Hezbollah faction said its 
response will "horrify everybody" if the warships approach. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, did not say what it would do, but it has threatened 
suicide attacks on Western targets and is believed to sponsor Shiite gangs that 
hold most of the 14 Western hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Amal, a more moderate Shiite militia, have fought a bloody power 
struggle for 16 months but said they were joining forces against "this 
American-Israeli-French plot." 
</P>
<P>
Police said one person was killed and three were wounded in shelling along the 
line that divides the capital into Muslim West Beirut and the Christian eastern 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes along the line have occurred daily since an artillery war began 
March 8 between the 20,000 members of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army 
and a Muslim alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese military sources said French vessels were cruising 40 miles off 
Lebanon. The French say the ships are on a "humanitarian mission," to evacuate 
the French citizens in Lebanon if necessary.

FCC CHARGES 3 RADIO STATIONS WITH INDECENT PROGRAMMING 
</P>

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission, invoking its seldom-used authority to 
police pornographic broadcasts, initiated administrative proceedings Thursday 
against three radio stations accused of airing sexually explicit programs. 
</P>
<P>
The radio stations, located in San Jose, Chicago and Indianapolis, could be 
fined up to $20,000 each for the alleged violations of broadcast decency laws, 
all of which occurred during daytime talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, the FCC has held only three broadcasters in violation of the 
obscenity standards. 
</P>
<P>
In letters addressed to the three stations, the agency alleged that material 
broadcast was "clear and capable of a specific, sexual meaning and is patently 
offensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Names Programs 
</P>
<P>
The agency singled out the "Perry Stone Show" on station KSJO-FM in San Jose, 
the "Steve and Gary Show" on WLUP-AM in Chicago and the "Bob and Tom Show" on 
WFBQ-FM in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Each station management has 30 days to respond to the charges, after which the 
agency will decide whether a violation occurred and what punishment might be 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the radio stations could not be reached for comment Thursday 
night. However, the Washington-based Media Access Project, a First Amendment 
rights group, criticized the action by the commission, which is now headed by 
Alfred Sikes, its new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"The symbolism of this being the first major action of the new chairman means 
that he places a higher priority on suppressing speech than on supporting 
speech," said Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The agency cited a number of allegedly objectionable broadcasts on each of the 
daytime shows, including a sexually graphic parody of the "Beverly Hillbillies" 
theme song on KSJO, a song named "kiddie porn" on the Chicago station and a 
WFBQ talk show discussion of sex acts using the names of candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Court Definition 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it was applying a court ruling that defines indecent material 
as "language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms 
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the 
broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the agency's use of the 
obscenity definition, rejecting arguments that it was too vague to be 
constitutional. At the same time, the appeals court affirmed the agency's 
decision that material broadcast on the "Howard Stern Show" in New York was 
indecent. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the FCC said that the agency action came after complaints were 
filed by listeners.

TAKES CARE OF NATION'S BUSINESS DURING 'TOTAL VACATION';

BUSH EASILY MIXING WORK AND PLAY

KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every morning this week just before 8 a.m., a black Ford Tempo has followed the 
serpentine seaside trail of Ocean Avenue and turned right at the narrow 
driveway leading to President Bush's 11-acre compound. 
</P>
<P>
The driver is Robert M. Gates, the President's deputy national security 
adviser, arriving to deliver the President's daily intelligence briefing -- an 
update on events around the world and a review of their impact on national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' visit is the one element of routine that varies little from the 
President's workday in Washington. But, otherwise during his first of nearly 
three weeks of vacation in this coastal village, the President has developed a 
work schedule that doesn't cut deeply into the raison d'etre for his visit 
here: jogging, fishing, boating, tennis, golf with his sons, playing with 
grandchildren, dozing off while reading a book on the living room sofa during 
the afternoon and, when the mood strikes him, going to bed at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so energetic about his work and his play and he mixes it with such ease 
that it's hard to sort it out," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Total vacation" is the way the President describes his sojourn this summer in 
Kennebunkport, where he says the crisp nights of late August produce "good 
sleeping weather." 
</P>
<P>
But there is some work getting done. 
</P>
<P>
His aides report that he is in and out of his office "a couple of times a day" 
to keep up with his mail, the half-dozen messages from Cabinet members that 
have arrived over the last week and preparations for a nationally televised 
speech Sept. 5 on his anti-narcotics program. 
</P>
<P>
In just the sort of mixture of pleasure and business to which Fitzwater 
referred, Bush spoke briefly and optimistically to reporters Thursday about the 
Polish situation after he docked his cigarette-class boat Fidelity at Chick's 
Marina here. Then he went aboard an 86-foot boat owned by Edward H. Hennessey 
Jr., president of Allied-Signal Corp., to visit with South Carolina Gov. 
Carroll A. Campbell Jr., former Marine Corps Commandant P. X. Kelley and 
Hennessey. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the morning, Bush welcomed Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter to 
Walkers Point, his estate on a rocky promontory jutting into the Atlantic. The 
prime minister and his wife, Anne Marie, were spending about 24 hours as house 
guests of the President and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, his wife, Mila, and 
their four children will be overnight guests of the Bushes. 
</P>
<P>
And, Bush said on Wednesday in an informal news conference, in the coming week 
he may also meet with several Cabinet members to discuss the anti-drug program. 
His speech is planned for the day after he returns to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The President's office is situated in what was originally known as the 
gardener's cottage, a two-story, two-bedroom guest house 100 yards across the 
family's 11-acre compound. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the office, the house contains a very small kitchen and provides 
work space for a secretary and temporary living quarters for Don Rhodes, a 
longtime personal aide to the President. The secretarial position is being 
filled on this trip by Linda Casey, executive assistant to White House Chief of 
Staff John H. Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the White House staff -- such as it is -- that accompanied Bush to 
Kennebunkport is housed in several of the old frame hotels typical of an 
established New England summer vacation town. This weekend, the three senior 
officials who accompanied Bush to Maine are scheduled to be replaced by three 
others. 
</P>
<P>
But the Washington-to-Kennebunkport migration is a mere shadow of the movement 
of the government that took place each summer during the previous eight years. 
When Ronald Reagan returned to his California ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains 
near Santa Barbara, he often took with him an expanded team of his most senior 
aides and their mid-level assistants, who moved into the posh quarters of the 
Santa Barbara Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is the fleet of upscale gray sedans and military drivers from the White 
House motor pool that chauffeured the staff up to the ranch -- on the rare 
occasions when Reagan met with his aides there -- or about town to dinner 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Now, aides in Kennebunkport who need to see the President make their way in 
small rented cars. When Sununu visited Kennebunkport on Monday and then made a 
side trip to hold a news conference, he and another senior presidential 
assistant, James Cicconi, eventually accomplished their getaway in the compact 
Ford, with Gates as their driver. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, after the personal intelligence briefing -- the vacationing Reagan 
generally received his on paper, rather than in person -- Bush will speak with 
Fitzwater to discuss the approach the press secretary will take to questions he 
might face during his daily press briefing at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, Cicconi, the White House staff secretary, will have 
reviewed documents, speech drafts, messages from Cabinet members and other 
correspondence dispatched to Kennebunkport by facsimile machine from the White 
House. That done, he drops off paper work for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
There is no set time when the President might visit his office here. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very secure man and he's not afraid to say he's on vacation," Fitzwater 
said. "He does what he needs to do to run the government, but he also knows 
it's important to have a vacation."

HUD AIDE LAUDED PROGRAM THAT LED TO DEFAULTS;

<P>
DEMERY BACKED LENDER COINSURANCE, WHICH COULD COST PUBLIC $500 MILLION

<P>
When Thomas T. Demery was new on the job at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development in late 1986, he gave a speech introducing himself to his 
co-workers, outlining what he wanted to accomplish as the assistant secretary 
in charge of millions of dollars of housing loans. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things he rhapsodized about was the agency's coinsurance program, a 
concept he called "the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
"Coinsurance is the epitome of the (Ronald) Reagan Administration," he wrote in 
a draft of his remarks that was released to the press along with other 
documents Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underwriting Lenders 
</P>
<P>
"It delegates to the private sector what the private sector can do best: put 
deals together, analyze and evaluate risk, and underwrite that risk," Demery 
wrote. "At the same time, coinsurance takes the government out of the 
processing and decision-making in mortgage finance transactions. Under 
coinsurance, HUD, in essence, underwrites lenders rather than individual 
loans." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, one of the largest lenders underwritten by the government 
has gone belly up, defaulting on scores of loans that could cost taxpayers more 
than $500 million. And Demery is one of the principal figures being 
investigated by Congress as it probes charges of mismanagement, fraud and abuse 
at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a federal grand jury is investigating allegations of theft, fraud 
and money laundering involving the coinsurance program and Washington-based DRG 
Funding Corp., which eventually defaulted on 29% of its loans. 
</P>
<P>
Demery's papers, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, shine little 
new light on happenings at the beleaguered housing agency, but they offer 
insights about one of the central participants in the growing 
influence-peddling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The single box of documents shows that Demery came to the agency sensing a 
"malaise" and left bitterly fighting with his boss because he wanted to fire a 
deputy who regularly missed meetings because of a busy social schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Demery wrote volumes of thank-you notes and forwarded the resumes of friends to 
prospective employers, as well as sending out his own resume in an unsuccessful 
attempt to become secretary of HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Demery, a former Michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker who worked in 
Reagan's 1980 campaign, administered several of HUD's biggest programs, 
including $225 million in moderate rehabilitation funds awarded annually and 
the massive Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance program. 
Through loan defaults and alleged mismanagement, the FHA has been losing 
millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the speech during his first week on the job, the new assistant secretary 
stressed "program enforcement" as a way of " . . . combatting defaults and 
bankruptcies." 
</P>
<P>
But, after three weeks, Demery wrote a memo to his deputies complaining that 
the agency was bedeviled by "malaise." He said the agency "does not appear to 
have an overall sense of direction" and found an "urgency in our need to 
provide leadership." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . There is a feeling permeating Housing that there is a lack of purpose, 
coordination and specific accomplishment," he wrote on Nov. 17, 1986. " . . . 
We are adrift in a great morass of rules, regulations and policy without any 
particular focus." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Demery tried to focus on was firing his deputy, R. Hunter Cushing. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue remains that you've lost control of the people who work for you, the 
public you serve, and the industry you oversee," Demery said in a 1986 letter 
to Cushing. Demery called Cushing's offer to "abdicate authority" in return for 
retaining his title "not a workable solution" and said he would speak to HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. about removing him. 
</P>
<P>
But Pierce sided with his executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, who supported 
Cushing even though he worked for Demery. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuffed and not happy, Demery wrote to Cushing after he missed a meeting in 
June, 1988: 
</P>
<P>
"Summertime attendance conflicts due to heavy social commitments and 
inconvenient flight schedules are inappropriate reasons for not attending staff 
meetings. I also think your suggestion to change my meeting time to accommodate 
your social life was equally inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Demery had no better luck in lobbying for the job of HUD secretary. 
</P>
<P>
He sent a form letter dated Dec. 7, 1988, to several senators, congressmen and 
a high-ranking aide to President-elect Bush asking for the job, which 
eventually went to Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become greatly challenged and sensitized to the public policy questions 
surrounding the homeless, the availability of low-income housing, and the 
difficulty the elderly and first-time home buyers face in finding affordable 
housing," he wrote, asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
In social missives, Demery was effusive. In 1988, he wrote to Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S. C.): "What a nice surprise to receive the delicious pecans! When 
I saw the bucket, I thought Colonel Sanders was delivering fried chicken -- but 
this is much more appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
The former commissioner appears also to have been something of an idealist, 
having compiled a five-page listing of optimistic quotations under the heading 
of "Housing Has a Commitment to Excellence Because Housing Helps People." 
</P>
<P>
Among annotated quotes from St. Francis, George Bernard Shaw, John Wooden, Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and Howard Cosell were some that appear to be Demery's 
own. One reads: "People forget how fast you did a job -- but they remember how 
well you did it."

A House panel investigating favoritism and mismanagement in federal housing 
programs was in a standoff Thursday with Paine Webber Inc. over whether the 
company's chief executive officer will be called to testify next month. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations 
housing subcommittee, invited Donald B. Marron, chief executive officer of the 
investment firm, to testify on Sept. 27 about the firm's consulting 
arrangements with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Tuesday, Lantos said that questions about Paine Webber's 
involvement had been raised during the panel's investigation of Lance H. 
Wilson, a first vice president of Paine Webber and a former HUD official. 
Wilson has been subpoenaed to testify at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday in New York, Paine Webber said: "The 
appropriate person to testify is James C. Treadway Jr., our general counsel, 
and we have so suggested to the subcommittee."

'LOOPHOLES' TARGETED IN DRUG WAR; 
</P>
<P>
VAN DE KAMP SEEKS $1.7 BILLION FROM BUSINESS TAX BREAKS

<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp called Thursday for closing "corporate tax 
loopholes" to raise $1.7 billion to pay for a crackdown on drug dealers and 
help addicts kick their habits. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic gubernatorial hopeful shied away from calling his proposal a tax 
increase, preferring instead to use the euphemism, "revenue enhancement." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a revenue enhancement, there's no question about that," Van de Kamp said 
testily when asked if his proposal amounted to a tax increase. "It increases 
revenues for the state. You can call it whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Describing California as "the No. 1 target for the Colombian drug cartels," the 
attorney general said his eight-year program could put more than 2,000 police 
officers on the street and expand drug treatment programs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be raised by closing "loopholes" in the state's corporate tax 
laws that allow businesses to keep an average of $222 million a year, Van de 
Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Capitol press conference, Van de Kamp repeatedly invoked the name of 
former Republican President Ronald Reagan, who signed legislation eliminating 
similar tax exemptions as one small part of the massive federal tax overhaul of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"He was willing to do it. Why shouldn't I?" the Democrat asked. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's idea drew a frosty response from the governor he hopes to 
succeed. A spokesman for Gov. George Deukmejian said the Republican chief 
executive would veto the measure if it reached his desk because it would raise 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a tax increase on business without any offsetting tax 
reductions," said Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary. "The governor does 
not support real or perceived tax increases without a vote of the people." 
</P>
<P>
But Brett acknowledged that Van de Kamp's tax proposal is identical to part of 
a "revenue enhancement" plan Deukmejian himself offered last year to make up 
for a drop in state tax receipts. The governor angrily withdrew his proposal 
after it was branded a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Van de Kamp proposed eliminating 10 tax breaks for business, 
including the deferral of taxes on vacation pay, installment sales and income 
from long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The money raised would go into the "California Anti-Drug Superfund," which 
would be devoted to the expansion of anti-drug activities. Among the programs 
funded would be expansion of local law enforcement, prosecution of drug cases, 
drug education and addict-treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the attorney general's plan, the drug provision will be amended into a 
bill carried by Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley) -- now stalled on the Assembly 
floor -- that would eliminate the 10 tax breaks for business. 
</P>
<P>
"Assemblyman Klehs and I are proposing legislation that will prove to the drug 
lords and the gangs and the pushers that Californians mean what they say: This 
state is deadly serious about winning the war on drugs," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs acknowledged that business leaders are opposed to the bill, which would 
result in a first-year tax increase of $355 million. "The business community 
would prefer to have $355 million in new loopholes created for them," Klehs 
said.

EX-CONS NOT TIED TO NEWTON, POLICE SAY

<P>
Three armed ex-convicts, including a reputed cocaine dealer, were arrested near 
where Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton was killed, but Oakland 
police Thursday steadfastly denied a published report that the men are suspects 
in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested within 14 hours of Newton's slaying early Tuesday on 
suspicion of being ex-convicts in possession of firearms, but Oakland Police 
Sgt. Dan Mercado said they had not been linked to the former black militant's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I wish there was a link, but there isn't," Mercado said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the arrests began when the San Francisco Examiner late on 
Thursday quoted an unnamed source "close to the investigation" that Oakland 
police believed that the men may have killed Newton because, the paper said, he 
was disrespectful to them in a pre-dawn confrontation in a poor Oakland 
neighborhood plagued by drug dealing and violence. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted its source as saying that police were unsure if the 
killers realized whom they were confronting. 
</P>
<P>
Police immediately denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at a loss to explain to other news media why the Examiner would print that 
story," said Police Lt. Mike Sims. "They certainly didn't clear it through me, 
and I wish they had. It might have saved a lot of embarrassment -- on their 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Sims said he could not even confirm that any of the arrested men had a drug 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had some knowledge that three men confronted Newton on the street and an 
argument ensued and they shot Newton, I would probably say, 'No comment,' " 
Sims conceded, "but to my knowledge, no one has said that is how Newton was 
killed. That would indicate a motive." 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators still have not established a motive for the killing, in 
which Newton, 47, a leading figure in the 1960s' Black Power movement, was shot 
in the head and left to die on an Oakland street corner near where he and Bobby 
Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner stood by its story despite police denials. 
</P>
<P>
Police did say they are continuing to focus their investigation on the last few 
hours of Newton's life, in hopes that a motive and suspects may be deduced by 
finding out why he was in that violent part of town at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
They have interviewed two people who spent time with him earlier in the morning 
and on the previous night, but declined to identify either person or disclose 
what they said.

BAJA CALIFORNIA COLUMNIST'S KILLER GETS 27 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Baja California state judge has imposed a near-maximum 27-year prison 
sentence on a former race-track security guard and one-time state police agent 
after convicting him of being the triggerman in the slaying of a prominent 
Tijuana journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Braulio Gomez Veronica found on Wednesday that Victoriano Medina Moreno, 
38, is guilty in the slaying of Hector Felix Miranda, a columnist who was 
widely known for more than a decade in Baja California under the nom de plume 
of El Gato -- the Cat. 
</P>
<P>
However, the long-expected ruling failed to curb the controversy and doubts 
surrounding a case that precipitated large protests against the state 
government and still inflames passions in Baja California. Many have maintained 
that a massive cover-up is under way and Medina, while an accomplice in the 
slaying, is a fall guy for higher, politically connected interests. Two 
suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
Medina has given conflicting versions of his involvement in the crime, first 
signing a confession and subsequently maintaining that he was innocent and that 
police had tortured him into confessing. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, whose gossipy, often-strident and frequently outrageous column -- Un 
Poco de Algo (A Little of Something) -- lampooned the movers and shakers of the 
border state and Mexico, was gunned down as he drove to work April 20, 1988. A 
gunman pumped two shotgun rounds through the driver's window of the late-model 
sedan as it was stopped or rolled slowly on a rain-slicked street. Felix was 
killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is widespread agreement that Medina was probably an accomplice 
in the slaying, many Mexican journalists, led by Felix's colleagues at the 
muckraking weekly Zeta, have maintained that Medina was probably no more than a 
driver at the scene. Indeed, Gomez noted in his sentencing document that the 
case will remain open until the apprehension of Antonio Vera Palestina, former 
security chief at the Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, who was Medina's ex-boss. 
Many believe that Vera was the actual triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
Vera, a former police official in Mexico City, is a fugitive. An arrest warrant 
has also been issued for a third former security official at the race track, 
Emigdio Nevarez, who also remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
J. Jesus Blancornelas, Felix's longtime partner and co-founder with him of 
Zeta, said he is convinced that the "intellectual author" of the crime has 
never been formally charged. Blancornelas has repeatedly pointed the finger, in 
print, at Jorge Hank Rhon, the president of Caliente, who is one of the richest 
men in Baja. His father, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is a former mayor of Mexico City 
and is counted among the Mexican power elite. The race track president, a 
frequent target of Felix's barbed pen, employed all three named suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the race track official and the elder Hank, who now is the national 
minister of tourism, a cabinet-level post, have denied any involvement in the 
slaying or in any cover-up.

QUAYLE DENIES LOOKING FOR ORANGE COUNTY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a visit to Orange County, Vice President Dan Quayle scotched rumors 
Thursday that he and his wife, Marilyn, are looking for a vacation home in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"We love to be here, but I don't think it is in the cards right now," Quayle 
said, dashing the hopes of the dozens of real estate agents who have called the 
White House in recent weeks offering to help the Quayles locate a second home 
in California. But he added, "Orange County is a wonderful place to be. 
Wonderful weather, wonderful people." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle made the comments as he arrived at a $500-per-person dinner at a Newport 
Beach restaurant, the second of two events he attended to help the Orange 
County and California Republican Party organizations raise money. 
</P>
<P>
A Quayle adviser said in July that the vice president was considering buying a 
home in California as a retreat.

Mutual Fund Assets Grow: The Investment Company Institute reported that the 
assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual funds rose by $2.68 billion in 
the latest week to hit a record of $343.22 billion. The rise in the seven-day 
period ended Wednesday marked the eighth straight week for an all-time high in 
fund assets, the Washington-based mutual trade group reported. The previous 
record set the week ended Aug. 16 totaled $340.54 billion, revised slightly 
upward from the $340.51 billion originally reported by the institute.

LORENZO WEIGHS SALE OF STAKE IN CONTINENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Lorenzo, the indomitable chairman of Texas Air Corp., said Thursday that 
he was discussing the sale of part or all of Continental Airlines with several 
unnamed parties. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo, who brought Continental out of bankruptcy in 1985 two years after 
filing for court protection from creditors, said he was considering the sale of 
a stake in Continental to give the airline "access to stronger financial or 
marketplace resources." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the stock market closed, Lorenzo said there were 
also several good reasons not to sell the airline. He said Continental had just 
emerged from a difficult period of consolidation after its bankruptcy and 
showed potential for improved results. He also pointed out that he and his 
associates have 17 years experience running Texas Air. Texas Air acquired 
Continental in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Lorenzo, who controls a large stake in Texas Air, was 
unexpected. Most airline industry analysts had expected Lorenzo to combine 
Texas Air's troubled Eastern Airlines unit with Continental to strengthen both 
carriers. Eastern is currently operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and is starting to rebuild despite a bitter and disabling 
strike by machinists. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, which has an extensive domestic route system and a large hub in 
Newark, N.J., earned a small profit of $32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion 
in the quarter that ended June 30. It is the main operating company of Texas 
Air. The airline isn't unionized, as a result of the 1983 bankruptcy filing 
that earned Lorenzo the reputation as a union-buster. 
</P>
<P>
Louis A. Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott 
in Philadelphia, said Lorzeno might be under pressure from Eastern's creditors 
to raise cash. Marckesano said Texas Air had guaranteed a portion of Eastern's 
$2-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LBO Called Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
"Or he may just be testing the waters in light of all the other airline buyouts 
that have taken place," said Marckesano. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, is considering takeover offers from 
several parties, including a $6.2-billion bid from Los Angeles investor Marvin 
Davis. Two months ago, Los Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi acquired NWA 
Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, for $4.05 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Marckesano said it was unlikely that Continental could be acquired through a 
leveraged buyout. In such a transaction, the purchaser borrows money to buy a 
company, using its assets or cash flow to repay the debt. Continental's 
aircraft and domestic landing slots are "fully valued and over-leveraged," 
leaving little ability to borrow against them, said Marckesano. 
</P>
<P>
One possible buyer for Continental was thought to be New York investor Carl C. 
Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airways.

Treasury Bill Rates Rise: Interest rates on 52-week T-bills rose to the highest 
level since June. The Treasury Department sold $9.3 billion of the bills at an 
average discount rate of 7.68%, up from 7.22% at the last comparable auction 
July 27. The rates were the highest since June 1, when the one-year bills sold 
for 8.18%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 
8.27%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,223.50.

USX Restores Pay Cuts: The nation's No. 1 steelmaker said it is restoring pay 
cuts and benefit reductions imposed on 5,500 white-collar workers during lean 
times in the early 1980s. On Sept. 1, about 1,400 hourly non-union employees 
will see a restoration of the 5% pay cut they took in 1983, a USX spokesman 
said. Those non-union workers and 4,100 management employees will also regain 
two paid holidays that were cut in 1986, increasing the paid holidays to nine.

Kenyon to Rule on Lucky Merger: U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles 
has scheduled a hearing Tuesday at which he will consider what size bond 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp should be required to post to pursue 
his case against American Stores' merger of Lucky and Alpha Beta. The matter 
was left up to Kenyon by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who 
this week granted Van de Kamp's request to continue the prohibition against the 
supermarket chains' merger, on the condition that Van de Kamp post a bond. Last 
month, Kenyon set bond at $16.3 million to cover any losses that American 
Stores might incur during the appeal process. Since Van de Kamp challenged the 
merger last September on antitrust grounds, American Stores has argued that 
delays in integrating the chains have cost it about $1.5 million a week.

PRETZEL MAKER ROLLING IN DOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
OAT BRAN FAD HELPS OLDEST BAKERY IN U.S. TO ITS BEST YEAR.

<P>
This picturesque and historic Lancaster County town, dotted with 
pre-Revolutionary War homes, stores, churches and inns, is the birthplace of 
America's pretzel industry. 
</P>
<P>
The original pretzel factory -- still operating despite more than two centuries 
of wear and tear -- costs $1 to visit. For the dollar, you get a pretzel, which 
is your admission ticket; once in, you eat the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Sturgis established the nation's first pretzel bakery in 1861, 
converting the family's old general bakery, and it has remained in the family 
since. The Sturgis Pretzel House is a quaint stone building -- built in 1774 as 
a home with a connecting bakery -- now used as the company's headquarters and 
bakery. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first 87 years," said Clyde Tshudy, 51, who bought the company in 
1972, "the huge brick ovens were used to bake bread. Then in 1861, Julius 
Sturgis, a cousin -- we have a common grandfather going way back -- began the 
first pretzel bakery in this country. He used the brick ovens built by my 
great-great-great-grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he is still using the gas-fired, 215-year-old brick and clay 
ovens to bake soft pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
The company makes a variety of pretzels, soft and hard, salted and unsalted 
(called baldies), pretzels shaped like the horse and buggy rigs used by 
Lancaster County's Amish people, tiny pretzels the size of a quarter, 
giant-size pretzels, cheese pretzels, oat bran and whole-wheat pretzels, 
left-handed pretzels (with the twist running in the opposite direction) and 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been going nuts lately for oat bran pretzels," Tshudy said. "We 
can't make enough of them. Oat bran pretzels are a health kick fad." 
</P>
<P>
Tshudy; his wife, Barbara; son, Michael; daughter-in-law, Holly, and a dozen 
others work part time and full time at the pretzel factory, which produces 
10,000 pounds of the snacks a day. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's sales totaled $650,000, the biggest in the company's 128-year 
history, Tshudy said, with mail orders and retail sales at the factory 
representing 10% of the production. The rest was wholesaled to stores and other 
outlets as far away as Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pretzel industry recorded an all-time high in sales last year -- $430 
million -- according to Jane Wuerthner, spokeswoman for the Snack Food Assn., 
headquartered in Alexandria, Va. And that does not count sales by mom-and-pop 
pretzel makers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The pretzel's traditional twisted design -- with its three holes in the middle 
-- has been traced to a monastery in southern France in AD 1610 and is said to 
represent arms folded in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1950s, the twists and turns of Sturgis pretzels were all made 
by hand. The company then employed 30 twisters and eight bakers, turning out 
3,000 pounds of pretzels a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Lewis Sturgis, one of Julius Sturgis' eight sons, had been running the company 
for years," Clyde Tshudy recalled. "He was reluctant about converting to 
pretzel-making machines and didn't think anyone would eat a pretzel made by a 
machine. But he finally came around." And just recently the company installed a 
new $400,000 machine to shape and bake its hard pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
The old craft lives on, however. Each visitor to the plant -- about 50,000 each 
year -- is shown how to twist pretzels by hand.

Just a few years ago, when icicles hung from Florida's fruit trees and strange 
spots sprouted on their leaves, there were doubts whether the state's citrus 
industry would survive the decade. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the losses of millions of trees to wintry weather and disease, 
growers now are gearing up for a bumper crop that is expected to herald growth 
and prosperity in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers' association, predicts the 
state's 1989-90 orange output will exceed the 146.6-million boxes produced in 
the previous growing season, which was the best in eight years.

AUSTRALIAN PILOTS QUIT IN BITTER DISPUTE OVER PAY

Australia's domestic airline pilots resigned en masse Thursday after airlines 
started firing them individually over a pay dispute that has shut down the 
nation's air services. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate travelers thwarted by a shutdown of domestic services were flying 
1,200 miles to New Zealand and back just to hop from one Australian city to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Federation of Air Pilots delivered the 1,600 resignations to 
airlines after the companies started taking legal action against individual 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side would comment on the move, which aviation industry analysts said 
could cause the airlines serious financial problems because some pilots were 
entitled to large pension and long-service payments of more than $380,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strain for Airlines 
</P>
<P>
Some could receive more than $760,000, adding to the strain for the airlines, 
already losing millions of dollars each day that their planes are grounded. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round in the two-week dispute about pilots' demands for a 30% wage 
hike came hours after some international airlines, responding to a government 
request, began ferrying passengers on the internal sectors of their services. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force transport planes were being prepared on the orders of the Labor 
government for emergency domestic service. 
</P>
<P>
Normal domestic services were suspended late Wednesday, although some flights 
operated early Thursday as aircraft returned to their home airports. 
</P>
<P>
Air New Zealand, which operates 120 flights to and from Australia weekly, said 
travelers prepared to fly any distance to get to their destinations had boosted 
bookings sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"Australians are aware New Zealand is a close destination," said spokeswoman 
Heather Jeffrey. "It is only three hours from an eastern (Australian) city and 
three hours back." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases people wanting to get from Sydney to Melbourne -- a 500-mile 
flight -- were flying by way of Auckland or Christchurch, a 2,500-mile round 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawke Comments Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The grounded companies, state-owned Australian Airlines, Ansett Airlines of 
Australia and East-West Airlines, announced legal action against individual 
pilots, firing some and suing others for damages. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots federation said Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his ministers had 
inflamed the situation with their comments and made it impossible for 
negotiations to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke, in various television and radio interviews, has repeatedly belittled the 
pilots' skills, at one point comparing them to bus drivers.

SHOWED BIRTH AT SEA WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
TV AD STARRING KANDU, BABY SHAMU IS HALTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sea World has pulled a television ad featuring Baby Shamu and Kandu swimming 
together, Dan LeBlanc, the park's public relations director, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The ad showed the birth of Baby Shamu during a performance at the marine park 
last year by her mother, killer whale Kandu. Kandu died Monday in a freak 
accident after ramming Corky, a killer whale who performs under the name Shamu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kandu Attacked Corky 
</P>
<P>
Kandu, who was about 14 years old and weighed 4,600 pounds, attacked Corky, who 
is said to be in her middle to late 20s and weighs 7,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials said Kandu died of hemorrhaging of major arteries. The 
injuries came when she attacked Corky with her mouth open. The impact fractured 
her upper jaw, causing fatal bleeding in the whale's nasal passages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Often-Aired Commercial 
</P>
<P>
The ad showing the birth of Baby Shamu had probably been the most prominent one 
used by the park for the summer season. The ad's theme suggested "a new 
beginning" at the park. 
</P>
<P>
According to LeBlanc, the ad was pulled the day of the accident. However, two 
independent television stations in Los Angeles said they were still running the 
ad and had not received orders to pull it. 
</P>
<P>
Kandu's death has not affected attendance at the marine park, LeBlanc said, 
adding that the attraction has "received literally thousands of phone calls" 
and flowers from animal lovers grieving over Kandu's death.

COMFORT LEVEL TO STAY HIGH FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds slightly suspicious, a little illegal, but definitely wonderful. San 
Diego will be under the influence of an upper-level trough of low pressure 
through the weekend, the National Weather Service said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Loosely translated, this means San Diego is in for more comfortable summertime 
weather, with temperatures slightly below seasonal, said forecaster Harvey 
Hastrup. Throw in some sunny skies and ocean sea breezes to complete the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"The same weather pattern we've been experiencing for the past week is expected 
to continue through this weekend," Hastrup said. "We may feel a very slow 
warming trend beginning Sunday. However, the temperatures will still remain 
below normal for this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, there will be night and morning low clouds, becoming mostly 
sunny in the afternoons, Hastrup said. Highs today and Saturday will be from 69 
to 72 degrees, nudging up a couple of degrees on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 2 to 3 feet. Sea breezes are 10 to 18 m.p.h. The ocean water is 
near 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal strip also will experience some night and morning low clouds, but 
days will be sunny with highs in the mid-70s, Hastrup said. Overnight lows will 
be from 63 to 68 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Highs inland will be from 78 to 84 today and Saturday, rising a couple of 
degrees on Sunday, Hastrup said. Lows will range from 54 to 62. 
</P>
<P>
Fair conditions will prevail in the mountains through the weekend, with the 
exception of some low clouds and fog on lower coastal mountain slopes, Hastrup 
said. Occasional winds will gust up to 25 m.p.h. in the afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs will range from 70 to 78, and overnight lows will be between 48 
and 56. 
</P>
<P>
Highs in the desert will reach the mid-90s to low 100s today and Saturday. Lows 
will be from 67 to 75.

by artist Deborah Butterfield, catches a reflection of Regents Square. By the 
end of 1990, the area bounded by Interstates 5 and 805 and California 52 should 
contain more than 3 million square feet of commercial space. The Greater San

RADKE EVIDENCE DEBATE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguments began Thursday on a motion to have key evidence in the murder case of 
Mark Alan Radke ruled inadmissible because it was obtained after Radke had been 
illegally arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Radke, 23, of Mira Mesa, is charged with the Jan. 21, 1988, murder of Jeffrey 
Vance Rudiger, 16, of Scripps Ranch, whose partly clothed body was discovered 
near a pizza shop where the two worked. 
</P>
<P>
The motion to suppress evidence in the case, made by defense attorney Douglas 
C. Brown, has been to the U. S. Supreme Court, the California Supreme Court, 
and twice to the 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but attorneys on both 
sides said this is a crucial hearing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hearing before Superior Court Judge Charles R. Hayes was ordered by 
the appeals court, which instructed Hayes to determine whether the arrest was 
lawful and whether the evidence subsequently obtained is admissible in his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The order came despite rulings by three higher courts that the evidence is not 
admissible. 
</P>
<P>
The key issues being discussed at the hearing, which will resume Wednesday 
morning, are whether Radke was voluntarily transported to the police station, 
even though he was in handcuffs, and whether there was probable cause to 
impound his vehicle. Hayes said he would allow prosecutors to introduce new 
evidence.

L.A. PROBES PLAN TO TURN CONDOS INTO APARTMENTS

<P>
Los Angeles city officials are investigating whether the developer of a luxury 
condominium complex being built in Warner Center can legally rent the units as 
apartments instead of selling them. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city's Planning, Transportation and Building and Safety 
departments said they are evaluating the altered status of the 760-unit Summit 
project in Woodland Hills after complaints from Councilwoman Joy Picus and 
nearby homeowners, who said their property values will drop if the units are 
rented. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the three city departments, Picus said that the project had been 
approved as a condominium project and that the change in status raised 
questions about whether the project's approval should be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to Alter Project 
</P>
<P>
Picus asked the departments whether the developer, G. H. Palmer Associates, 
could legally alter the project from condominiums to apartments. She also asked 
whether the firm had addressed traffic and parking impacts and other issues, 
such as providing adequate access to the handicapped, before allowing the 
project to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Picus also asked whether the development's zoning restrictions are being 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
"This has understandably raised a great deal of concern in the community and 
raised a number of very legitimate questions," Picus wrote. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said no determination on the project would be made for at least 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Willbaum, a Los Angeles city transportation engineer, said apartments would 
generate more traffic than condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
He said 339 vehicular trips an hour would be generated by the project between 7 
and 9 a.m. if the units were condominiums, contrasted with 405 vehicular trips 
an hour during the same period if the units were apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vehicular Trips 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Willbaum said, 405 vehicular trips an hour would be generated 
between 4 and 6 p.m. if the units were condominiums, as opposed to 512 for 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
G. H. Palmer representatives were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Area homeowners said more apartments near the Woodland Hills complex will 
reduce property values and generate more noise and traffic. They said the 
developer had deceived them. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer announced two weeks ago that economics and an analysis of real estate 
conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units, even though 
they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer spokesmen said 
the firm had never promised to sell the units. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning for the property allows condominiums and apartments.

L.A. BLAMED FOR ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT ON HILLSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
BRAUDE FOCUS OF CRITICISM AT WOODLAND HILLS MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angry Woodland Hills homeowners confronted Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin 
Braude on Thursday to repeat their charges that city officials were negligent 
in allowing a condominium project to be built on a hill above their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, who met with Braude in the front yard of a home directly below 
the $7.5-million West Hills Condominiums, said the city Building and Safety 
Department permitted the developer to build the complex higher than legally 
allowed and was lax in enforcing requirements for landscaping of the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
They complained that the complex is so big and ugly that it lowered property 
values in their 30-year-old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowners' Leader 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing could have been stopped when all that was up there was a 
bunch of 2 by 4s," said Hope Perry, a Kelvin Avenue resident who, with her 
husband Sid, has helped lead opposition to the project. "But the city just let 
this go on and on. Now look what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
Although several residents raised their voices, the tone was more conciliatory 
than hostile toward Braude, who was blasted by a group of Encino homeowners a 
week earlier in a development dispute that set off fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
Braude calmly told the Woodland Hills group that, despite their unhappiness and 
some pending questions about the project, the complex was on the hill to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"My own feeling is that you should be prepared to live with this development," 
Braude said. "You've expressed all the things you can regarding this. Now is 
the time to start healing and move on. You should start to work together to 
protect the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Termed Unique 
</P>
<P>
The councilman added that there had been "more review of this project than any 
other project in the history of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Development partner James R. Gary, who said he was not invited to the meeting, 
added that he was frustrated by the continuing complaints of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it with this nonsense and misinformation that these folks are putting 
out," Gary said. "We're not only complying with the laws, we're going beyond 
compliance, according to the Department of Building and Safety." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners complained for months that the 80-unit project is illegal 
because it violates building requirements set by the City Council's initial 
approval in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Braude in April called for an investigation into approval of the project after 
construction permit irregularities were discovered. He said it needed to be 
determined once and for all whether the project is too tall, too wide or 
deficient in parking, as neighbors claimed. 
</P>
<P>
City zoning officials ruled in May that several loft structures atop the 
building exceeded a 45-foot height requirement imposed by the city 10 years ago 
and must be altered. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Zoning Appeals is scheduled to hear an appeal by the developer of 
that decision Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said Chief Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard will consider both 
sides of the controversy. "I'm confident Frank Eberhard will be fair," he said. 
"My sense is that it's in the hands of his department. If we can get 
cooperation from the builder, we should try to get that. If you feel the past 
has been bad, you must still move forward." 
</P>
<P>
But Braude did not appear to mollify several members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you compensate the financial loss to the homeowners?" asked Richard 
Oedy, who has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to recoup that," Braude said softly. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Corby, who lives below the project, said that despite many promises, the 
developer had failed to put in landscaping to shield the project from view. "I 
was guaranteed that the worst, the absolute worst we would see is the top of 
the building," she said. "I was told it would look like a forest." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the three-story building is visible from the streets below. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Murley, another resident, repeated a charge that the Building and Safety 
Department had been unethical in approving the project. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two weeks that Braude faced angry San Fernando Valley 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting last week, preceded by fistfights between rival homeowner groups, 
Braude was criticized by Encino residents for wavering in his support of 
proposals to extend Reseda Boulevard southward into the Santa Monica Mountains 
in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Encino residents said Braude had pledged 10 years ago that he would support the 
extension to alleviate heavy traffic on Encino streets that lead from the 
Valley into the Los Angeles Basin. However, Braude changed his mind a few 
months ago after protests by Tarzana residents, who oppose the extension.

MCKENNA DRAWS FIRE, BUT MOST OF HIS SCHOOL STAFF CHANGES GET OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood school board Wednesday night approved all but three of the 
staffing changes proposed by Supt. George McKenna for the fall, although some 
of the appointments generated intense criticism from parents and community 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Residents strongly criticized some of McKenna's appointments of principals and 
assistant principals, arguing that the new superintendent shuffled some 
incompetent administrators from one school to another and took no significant 
steps to improve school leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But McKenna, previously principal of Washington Preparatory High School in Los 
Angeles, stood firm on his recommendations, and a majority of the five-member 
school board concurred. Only three personnel decisions were struck down out of 
several dozen that came before the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Killing Morale' 
</P>
<P>
"If I cannot make the district function, you can with three votes find yourself 
another superintendent," McKenna said. "I am confident that the candidates 
before us are the best possible, available, qualified candidates, and I will 
stand on those." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Zyra McCloud, who joined parents in opposing many of McKenna's 
choices, told the new superintendent during one heated exchange: "I'm sick of 
this rhetoric. This is wrong, McKenna. . . . You're killing the morale of this 
district." 
</P>
<P>
But board Vice President Joseph Rouzan urged his colleagues to adopt the 
recommendations so that the school year could begin smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the controversial recommendations were the transfers of Principal Gladys 
Phillips-Evans from Monroe Junior High School to Warren Lane Elementary School, 
Principal Lacy Alexander from Woodworth Elementary School to Monroe and 
Principal Ruby Nelson from Oak Street Elementary School to Woodworth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfers Approved 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the administrators, none of whom could be reached for comment, had 
not proved themselves in their current posts. But the school board approved all 
three transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Joice Lewis, who works in special education for Los Angeles County, was 
rejected as the district's director of pupil personnel services because board 
members said there were qualified people from within the district who should 
have received the job. Later in the meeting, McKenna called Lewis "eminently 
qualified" for the cabinet-level post and asked the board to reconsider, but 
his request was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
The board also overturned McKenna's recommendation to transfer two bilingual 
teachers, Salud Salinda and Maria Vega, out of Oak Street Elementary after a 
parent presented a petition protesting the move and two students spoke out 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer was part of a dispute between several teachers and Nelson, the Oak 
Street principal, that began before McKenna arrived. Four teachers went on 
stress leave last year, charging that Nelson was a poor administrator who made 
their jobs unbearable. One group of parents sided with the teachers; another 
group sided with Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say McKenna decided to transfer Nelson to the principal's post 
at Woodworth and the two teachers to new assignments in other schools in order 
to defuse the situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Moves 
</P>
<P>
Other appointments approved Wednesday include: Art Murray, a high school 
principal in Bakersfield, to Morningside High School; Edward Brownlee, dean of 
students at Inglewood High School, to assistant principal of Morningside; Joe 
Steele, a teacher, to acting assistant principal of Morningside; Anthony Vega, 
a teacher, to dean of students at Inglewood; Marlene Felix, a teacher, to 
assistant principal of Monroe; Havon McLeod, assistant principal at La Tijera 
Elementary School, to Warren Lane; Gilman Gebo, acting assistant principal at 
Morningside, to assistant principal at La Tijera; and Jeraldine Martin, 
principal of Morningside, to assistant principal of adult education. 
</P>
<P>
When McKenna took office last October, many school employees and community 
leaders said the real test of his strength would be his ability to evaluate the 
staff, some of whom have political connections to past board members or city 
leaders, and put together a team that can turn around the low morale and low 
test scores that have become synonymous with education in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Coleman, the Inglewood PTA Council's liaison to the school board, accused 
McKenna of "playing musical chairs" at the expense of 15,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
"The honeymoon is over. . . . As much as I respect McKenna, he's making a grave 
mistake," Coleman said in an interview. "It's a gray day for the children of 
Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Smith, president of the PTA Council, said McKenna's staffing choices 
disappointed her, but she is willing to give him more time before she passes 
final judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still doing some casting," Smith said. "This is a big play, and he's 
still deciding who's going to play the parts. I don't believe in jumping on a 
person before they have a chance to try." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Praise 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, whose efforts in inner-city education won him nationwide praise and a 
television movie on his leadership style, has faced such staffing controversies 
before. More than 100 teachers left Washington Prep while he was at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of failing," McKenna said at Wednesday's meeting. "I have 
no intention of abdicating. I will continue to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I do not speak to you as a novice as to what it takes to be a 
principal." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a school district must notify administrators by Dec. 1 before 
beginning proceedings to demote or fire them in order to give them time to 
improve their performances. McKenna, who began as superintendent last Oct. 1, 
said he did not have adequate time to monitor school administrators before the 
deadline passed. He pledged to put all of Inglewood's administrators on notice 
this year that their performance is being watched. 
</P>
<P>
"George McKenna won tonight," one school employee who did not want to be 
identified said after the meeting. "He got his picks in. But watch those 
appointments. If they fail, he fails." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Meetings 
</P>
<P>
McKenna also came under criticism for a series of community meetings he held 
this summer at several Inglewood schools in which he asked parents what 
qualities they wanted in a new school administrator. Critics are now calling 
those meetings an effort to pacify the community in anticipation of the current 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the main supporters who brought McKenna in," McCloud said before 
the meeting. "If I made a mistake, I'm the first one to admit it to the 
parents. How can you call community forums, interview people and then transfer 
ineffective people around?" 
</P>
<P>
Board President Larry Aubry said the district will suffer unless board members 
work together with the superintendent and staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying like hell to make this an exemplary district, but it takes one 
step at a time," Aubry said. "We have to put a small amount of faith in each 
other."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE MAN SHOT TO DEATH IN INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man was fatally shot in Inglewood during an argument with another 
man, Inglewood police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Arnaldo Pimentel, 28, was pronounced dead about 6:40 p.m. Wednesday at Martin 
Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, Sgt. Harold Moret said. Pimentel was shot 
several times in the upper body about 5:30 p.m. while arguing with a man on a 
sidewalk in the 3800 block of 111th Place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were looking for the gunman, who fled in a car. Moret said it was not 
known what the men were arguing about. 
</P>
<P>
"There were witnesses who saw them drive up together," Moret said. "They were 
there for some time. Nobody paid any attention until 30 or 40 minutes later 
when they heard gunshots."

WEEKENDER: NORTHROP AND HAWTHORNE AIRPORT LOOK BACK TOWARD THEIR FLEDGLING DAYS 
WITH 'GOLDEN AGE OF AVIATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris What: Hawthorne Air Faire. When: Saturday, Sunday, 10 a.m to 4 
p.m. Where: Hawthorne Municipal Airport, 120th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard, 
Hawthorne. Admission: $2, children under 12 free. Free parking across Crenshaw 
in Nor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Northrop Aircraft Co. press release was dated Sept. 1, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
It reported that the fledgling company -- then consisting of aircraft design 
visionary Jack Northrop and six engineers -- would build its $500,000 factory 
on a tract of Hawthorne farmland near the intersection of El Segundo Boulevard 
and Prairie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As a part of the arrangement, the city intended to float a $47,000 bond issue 
to grade a landing field adjacent to the plant and construct a 3,700-foot 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
Roy L. Wolford, who set up Northrop's first photo lab in 1940, recalls taking a 
picture of the "first little building" when the airfield was still "just wheat 
stubble." 
</P>
<P>
Sawtooth structures -- called that because of the roof line -- soon took shape 
along the south side of the airfield. They are still there after several 
additions and remodelings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was part of an adventure because we were doing something new," Wolford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jim Randall, who recently celebrated his 50th anniversary as the 
company's longest-tenured employee: "(Jack) Northrop would say to us, 'You're 
doing it, not me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Like every other aircraft company, Northrop boomed during World War II. It did 
subcontracting work, built fighting seaplanes for the Norwegian government, and 
produced what Wolford called the "first big plane" of its own. That was the 
P-61 Black Widow, which was the first aircraft built specifically as a night 
fighter. The "flying wing" -- a Jack Northrop concept dating back to the 1920s 
-- also took shape, but the experimental bombers were scrapped by the Air Force 
in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Both the airfield and Northrop have grown over the years. Wolford had Badge 200 
when he went to work in April, 1940. The company, now known as the Northrop 
Corp., has 44,600 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
And Northrop Field, where the first landings a half-century ago were on an 
unpaved runway, is now the Hawthorne Municipal Airport with 120,000 takeoffs 
and landings a year. 
</P>
<P>
The airport also plays host every year to the Hawthorne Air Faire, which is 
billed as a weekend of family fun amid aircraft old and new, classic 
automobiles, food and novelty booths and aerospace exhibitions. Attendance 
usually runs 15,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's celebration of "The Golden Age of Aviation" on Saturday and 
Sunday will be all about anniversaries: the 50th birthdays of Northrop and the 
airport, as well as the the 50th anniversary of the first flights of historic 
bombers and fighter planes built by General Dynamics/Convair Division and 
Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Vintage World War II planes will arrive in a flyover starting at 1 p.m. 
Saturday. A current American fighter, the F-111, will fly in at 1 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sightseeing rides in light aircraft and old-fashioned biplanes will be 
available for a charge. In the case of the light plane, the cost will be 7 
cents a pound. "They'll have scales to weigh people," airport Administrator Bob 
Trimborn said. 
</P>
<P>
People may also rub elbows with aviation pioneers at a dinner held by the 
Chamber of Commerce on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel, 
5400 W. Century Blvd., near Los Angeles International Airport. Among those 
being honored are Sir Frank Whittle, the inventor of the jet engine, who 
conducted the first successful laboratory test in England in 1937. The dinner 
is open to the public by reservation at $40 a person. Call 676-1163. 
</P>
<P>
If the accent will be on history, the latest in Northrop technology -- the B-2 
Stealth bomber -- also will get some attention. Col. Richard Couch and Bruce 
Hinds, test pilots on the craft's maiden flight last year, will be at the 
Northrop exhibit to talk about the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Trimborn notes that the airport and Northrop have had a 50-year "open arms" 
friendship: When Jack Northrop was shopping for a location, the city helped 
lure him by building him an airfield, and Northrop brought Hawthorne industry 
and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Trimborn: "We've had 50 years of a very good partnership." Gerald Faris 
What: Hawthorne Air Faire. When: Saturday, Sunday, 10 a.m to 4 p.m. Where:

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: LESS EXPENSIVE, BUT THE TOUCH REMAINS; 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH CHEF GRUMEL TRIES NEW LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who poked his head into a French kitchen in North County in the last 
decade or so stood an excellent chance of encountering Vincent Grumel. 
</P>
<P>
North County has not been home to all that many French restaurants over the 
years, and Grumel has cooked at most of them, beginning with Mon Ami in Solana 
Beach and continuing with stints, sometimes as part-owner, at Bertrand's in 
Leucadia, Maison du Lac in Carlsbad, Cuisine a la Carte in Del Mar and, most 
recently, Vincent's in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
All of these restaurants, like the salt spume tossed up by a breaker at 
Moonlight Beach, have evaporated into memories, although those who enjoy fine 
French fare tend to reminisce enthusiastically about such Grumel triumphs as 
gratin dauphinoise (a garlicky potato casserole), duck roasted to a burnished 
amber and the magnificent Bavarois au chocolat, a complicated Bavarian cream 
that ranks with the best desserts of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Grumel has landed at another location in which he shares ownership, and it may 
be, in restaurant terms, the best location thus far. At high tide Grumel's new 
Vincent/Four Seasons would be no farther than 50 surfboard lengths from the 
ocean -- it's next to Carlsbad Inn at Elm Avenue and Carlsbad Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Serves 3 Functions 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant serves three functions. It supplies room service to the hotel as 
well as housing refrigerated carry-out cases stocked with attractive French 
delicatessen and Grumel's ineffable pastries. But the primary mission is 
serving good cuisine bourgeoise, a change from the days when Grumel specialized 
in fancier and costlier fare. 
</P>
<P>
"Alors! Here, we charge $13.95 to $15.95 and give soup or salad, and people 
love it," Grumel said after a recent dinner. "I can't charge the prices like at 
the places where I used to cook. I hope I have some success this time." 
</P>
<P>
Grumel stands a fair chance of getting his wish because his cooking continues 
to be not only refined, but, for lack of a more suitably descriptive term, 
energetic. He infuses dishes with strong, wonderful flavors, employing herbs 
with confidence and strong doses of garlic and other pungent seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is a little more rustic than those Grumel has cooked before, but not 
rough, because its rural notes come from the French countryside. The back 
country of Provence, Grumel's home, is well represented, but other regions show 
their colors. There are touches of ultra-contemporary cuisine, such as the 
charred scallops with candied orange sauce and the "shrimp 'n pasta with 
tomatoes, herbs 'n pimentos." The same items are available at lunch and dinner, 
although prices are higher at night, especially for desserts which can run as 
much as $6. As good as they are, that seems a bit steep. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specials on a Blackboard 
</P>
<P>
The daily specials are written on a blackboard, and the list by and large is so 
appealing that recourse to the printed menu seems unnecessary. A recent roster 
offered blanquette de veau, the famously creamy fricassee of veal; a terribly 
novel-sounding smoked swordfish and goat cheese pizza; boeuf bourguignon; lamb 
stew and bstilla, the poultry pie that is the Moroccan national dish. This dish 
gained worldwide notoriety just last weekend, when it starred as the entree at 
the $2-million birthday bash that publisher Malcolm Forbes threw for himself in 
Tangier. 
</P>
<P>
Lighter offerings include the quiche and omelet of the day, as well as salads 
such as celery root, Oriental chicken, tabouli, tortellini with artichokes and 
others, most of which are on display in the delicatessen cases. These cases, by 
the way, give the main room an informal tone. The outdoor terrace seems more 
appealing, however, particularly in summer. The staff provides cheerful and 
competent service. 
</P>
<P>
Meals open with a basket of wonderfully crusty, baked-on-premises baguette, 
which may be as good an appetizer as the offerings of shrimp in puff pastry, 
snails, oysters Rockefeller and, rather surprisingly, a twice-baked potato. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Includes Soup 
</P>
<P>
Grumel prepares pasta the French way. Guests who want to share a first course 
might split an order of the tortellini, which arrive napped with an unctuous 
reduction of cream and cheese and are delicate and savory. The price of the 
entree includes salad or soup. While the salad tends to be competent, the soup 
can be exquisite, as was a fine and full-bodied cream of fresh tomato scented 
with dill. 
</P>
<P>
A party of four gave most of its attention to the special entrees, of which the 
most successful was the bstilla. Shaped like a log, it consisted of a dozen 
layers of beautifully crisped phyllo dough stuffed with minced, 
saffron-flavored chicken, a beautifully rich filling. Dustings of powdered 
sugar and cinnamon gave it the traditional Moroccan -- and, to Western tastes, 
very exotic -- finish. 
</P>
<P>
The boeuf bourguignon was a typically hearty stew, the meat softly chewy and 
the smooth gravy rich in onions and carrots with an occasional whole clove of 
garlic tossed in to startle inattentive diners. The lamb stew, although similar 
in nature, was dressier because it was baked in a deep dish beneath a fragile 
puff pastry. The stew also featured a more exciting flavor, thanks to the fresh 
mint and the handful of green, unpitted olives that pinpointed its Provencale 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
The salmon in red bell pepper sauce was chosen from among the standing entrees. 
It had been poached by the book and was accordingly soft, fleshy and succulent. 
The somewhat sharp sauce did have an underlying bite, adding edible punctuation 
marks to each forkful of fish. The standing list also offers grilled chicken 
breast in raspberry sauce, roast duckling with caramelized citrus peel, lamb 
chops with garlic butter and steak in green peppercorn sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of the pastry tray remains the tarte Tatin, a large wedge cut from 
a giant wheel of flaky pastry crammed with buttery, caramelized apples. Grumel 
moistened this with a ladle of creme anglaise, which he flavored, rather 
unusually but quite likeably, with orange. Other choices included a blueberry 
Bavarian cream, a fat and thoroughly indulgent-looking eclair and a 
millefeuille or Napoleon, its "thousand leaves" of homemade puff pastry 
separated by layers of pastry cream and fresh strawberry.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: LEXUS: WOOING THE BMW, MERCEDES BUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a league of gentleness that is delineated by whispering engines, the 
slide of evening silks on glove leather and the production of enormous power by 
motor cars that simply must not pant nor perspire at exotic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the only true rivalry has been European: always BMW, Mercedes and 
Jaguar, Volvo to a somewhat lesser degree and Audi in a previous life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lap of Luxury 
</P>
<P>
Next week -- in a development really no more extraordinary than the way it has 
snitched world superiority from Europe in everything from manufacturing cameras 
to producing Formula One racing victories -- the tussle to sit in the lap of 
luxury cars is joined by Japan with the $35,000 Lexus LS400. 
</P>
<P>
The car officially goes on sale next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It should be transforming consumer loyalties by the next day. 
</P>
<P>
And the gentle folk from Europe may be forgiven some uncharacteristic gasping 
and sweating because this discreet, lush-to-the-gunwales Lexus has an 
indefatigable notice to serve: It may be too new, too soon to displace the 
mid-range aristocracy of high-performance luxury cars -- but it's a vehicle 
that certainly belongs in their company. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing. Early trade paper and business world interpretations of the 
Lexus threat held that here was a car to compete against Cadillac and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, with one introduction, by all the standards of performance, price and 
quality, Lexus has rendered Detroit's down-stuffed cruisers obsolete to all but 
die-hards who winter in Tucson and are on their sixth Fleetwood. 
</P>
<P>
Yet conquering only U.S. luxury vehicles wasn't what Toyota Motor Corp., the 
company behind the neoteric Lexus line, had in its sights. It wanted to knock 
off everyone. Or as chairman Eiji Toyoda challenged his management and 
engineering team in 1983: "Build the world's finest luxury performance sedan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Segment of Market 
</P>
<P>
Away from hyperbole and closer to reality, a Torrance spokesman for the company 
believes Lexus has landed squarely atop a segment of the market ("the infamous 
baby boomers, that bulge in society entering its prime earning years") that can 
afford a mid-range Mercedes or BMW but currently drives cars by Nissan, Toyota 
or Acura. 
</P>
<P>
"A (Japanese) luxury car isn't presently available for this group . . . that 
wants to drive something saying they are a success in life," he continued. And 
this group, he maintained, isn't interested in the blatant status of up-market 
European cars. "It is a question of backlash against 'conspicuous consumption.' 
If you drive a BMW 735, everybody about knows what you paid for the car. But if 
we can offer a product of equal performance for considerably less, they 
(owners) will be seen as the smart buyer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smart Buyer 
</P>
<P>
But what of the smart buyer who recognizes the value of heritage and prestige 
(to say nothing of the piddling depreciation rate) attached to owning a 
Mercedes 300E (at $44,850) or a BMW 535 (at $43,500)? 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will be hard to win over BMW and Mercedes owners," said the 
representative. "But in the years ahead we will get them. Probably not in the 
next five or six years, but we are here for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
The long haul. That's exactly what we did with the Lexus LS400 (top of a 
two-car Lexus line supported by the smaller, slower, less expensive entry-level 
ES250) while jamming it for more than 1,000 miles in two days. 
</P>
<P>
The run was from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a pause in Danville to 
wallow in the automotive treasures of the year-old Behring Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up 101, Down 5 
</P>
<P>
Up via U.S. 101 -- suffering trucks, meandering tourists and marauding CHP 
Mustangs clotting every promising stretch from before Santa Barbara to after 
Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Back via Interstate 5 -- with duller, yet broader lanes and a more liberal 
speed limit made for cars with longer legs. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, in terms of gluteal calcification and the mental rigors of long 
distance driving, the ride by Lexus was no more wearying than taking USAir. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury, of course, is relatively easy to build into any car. It's an amalgam of 
leather upholstery, a softer ride, automatic this, remote controlled that, 
sound-booth insulation and, in the Lexus, prewiring for a cellular phone and a 
steering wheel that lifts and retracts automatically to enhance the dignity of 
exiting the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
When an automotive development team comprises 1,400 inventive engineers in 
search of merit raises, one must expect technological innovations that would 
boggle Marconi. 
</P>
<P>
With Lexus, it's a system of dueling computers -- one on the engine, another on 
the automatic transmission -- that 'talk' to each other to reduce the snap of 
shifting gears. There's another black box to control brakes and throttle -- no 
matter a driver's abuse of either -- for maximum traction on glistening roads. 
</P>
<P>
Antilock brakes, of course. Super-high tolerance engineering and special 
materials for maximum sound dampening, naturally. And the cleanest, lowest 
aerodynamic numbers in the luxury car field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected Power Plant 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the expected powerplant for the job -- a trusty, aluminum, 4-liter 
V8 sophisticated by fuel injection, four overhead cams and 32 valves. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of motoring rapidly in firm comfort, however, is not a question of 
all the right pieces. It is the sum of those parts and how total the cohesion? 
</P>
<P>
With Lexus, the melding of its portions, major and minor, performance and 
comfort, design and styling, seems close to absolute. 
</P>
<P>
It shows in the balance and chunk of closing doors and ultra-smooth performance 
that is finesse at any speed. No mechanical whimpers or creaks escape the 
functions of acceleration, braking and steering. 
</P>
<P>
Lexus' engine note is a whisper (save for a magnificent, ripping whine during 
serious traveling) and wind noise doesn't exist. Even the walnut-fronted 
ashtray responds to a touch and hisses open to recall the subtle elegance of 
the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
The clincher of total integration emerges when realizing this is a heavy car of 
healthy acceleration and enormous top speed that still manages to offer gas 
consumption of 23-miles-per-gallon -- while some among its luxury competition 
are content to pay gas guzzler taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Coil springs are standard on the Lexus with an optional air suspension system 
that automatically varies spring and shock-absorber settings. 
</P>
<P>
In either "Sport" or "Normal" modes, we found the air suspension acceptable for 
high-speed cruising. But it adds a noticeable lean (to say nothing of the 
discomfort of body weight oozing to the outside) when entering even tame turns 
at speeds a smidge beyond posted recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The LS400 is attractive enough in a docile sort of way. But the duck tail rear 
is somewhat Mercedes. Overall there's a definite look of Taurus. White bread, 
noted one critic. Wake me when it has passed, said another. 
</P>
<P>
All of which suggests a need for a second-year styling review to add not flash, 
but maybe some touch of crisp, external distinction to a car that internally 
and mechanically, is highly distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
With the LS400, the Japanese auto industry moves up-market and to acceptance by 
many who thought they'd never live to pay $40,000 for any Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
A month from now, Nissan enters the same niche with its V8-powered Infiniti M30 
carrying an identical $35,000 base price. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will reach into the very expensive, top drawers of BMW and Mercedes. 
But, suddenly, both manufacturers must be finding life pretty crowded in the 
luxury fast lane.

HIP GARB HAS A DEEP-ROOTED APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nursing student Cookie Morris celebrated her birthday last year in a standard 
cocktail dress. This year, she celebrated both her birthday and her heritage in 
a custom-made, three-piece African outfit, topped by an elaborately braided, 
gold-trimmed coif. 
</P>
<P>
Following her lead, most of her guests "were dressed head-to-toe African," says 
Morris, who explains she first went looking in mall shops for something with an 
ethnic feel. Unable to find what she wanted, she headed for "the real thing" at 
Beauty of Afrika, a little shop crammed with authentic masks, jewelry, fabrics 
and clothing, on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Fad 
</P>
<P>
European designers and American fashion magazines may have made "ethnic" (as in 
animal prints, sun-drenched colors, vibrant pattern mixes, heavy bangles and 
beads, sarong skirts, batik and tie-dyed fabrics) a hot trend this year, but 
among African-Americans, their ever-growing interest in wearing symbols of 
their culture is more than a fad. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks say they still can't wear dreadlocks or elaborate traditional clothing 
in a corporate setting. But the current fashion trend makes it easier to dress 
for work in sashes made of kente cloth (Ghanaian hand-woven fabric), armloads 
of bangles, lappas (wrapped skirts), kufis (hats known as "crowns"), drummer 
pants and contemporary clothing cut from vividly colored cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gray-flannel world, anything from anti-apartheid leather medallions 
to festive long dresses and matching head wraps are making the scene wherever 
and whenever blacks want to look fashionable, dress comfortably and demonstrate 
pride in their roots. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, the meaningful clothing and accessories are turning up anywhere 
from churches and schools to restaurants, clubs, reggae boat parties and 
festivals, such as the Afrikan Culture Day, which is held monthly, and this 
weekend's African Marketplace at James H. Whitworth Park (La Cienega Boulevard 
and Fairfax Avenue), both in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Stores that for years have quietly specialized in Afrocentric items are finding 
business better than ever. And all over the city, new designers and 
entrepreneurs are suddenly on the scene, promoting African goods and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Daniel, organizer of both Afrikan Culture Day and the Afrikan Reggae 
Boat Parties that go from Long Beach to Catalina Island, explains that he began 
the activities after Black History Month this year "to raise the consciousness 
of the African community as well as the European community we live in." 
</P>
<P>
To properly promote black history, Daniel says, "something must be done on a 
daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Lecturer 
</P>
<P>
"Black Americans are starting to reach for the culture. It's coming through in 
their dress and their life style," explains Ahneva Ahneva, owner of Crowns and 
Gowns, for which she designs $45-$1,500 contemporary clothing with an African 
influence. As owner of Designers Network International, she has been kept busy 
lately lecturing all over the world (including this year's African Liberation 
Day at New York City University and L.A.'s Marketplace) on Africa's fashion 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
At Cafe Afrique (in the Crenshaw District), owned by Safi and Kashif Shaheed, 
specialties of the house are Carribbean-African cuisine and an ever-increasing 
number of garments sold in the cafe's "little boutique." Priced from $25 for a 
pair of tie-dyed drummer pants to $150 for an embroidered gown, the colorful, 
"very traditional" clothing is designed by Safi and made in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
At Africana Imports on West Slauson Boulevard, owner Francesca Anuluoha has 
been making clothing out of West African fabric for more than 15 years. But 
now, she says, "I can't seem to make enough." Teen-agers, often influenced by 
rap stars, start with patriotic leather medallions, "and move from that to 
hats, tops, pants and books about their heritage." Prices range from $40 for a 
dashiki (top) to $700 for a bubu (long formal dress). 
</P>
<P>
Anuluoha's 14-year-old daughter, Nyambo, is required to wear a uniform to 
school. But for parties, she likes to put on African clothing and jewelry and 
symbols that show solidarity with blacks in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Texas-born Afua Chinue Ifama has often stood out in the crowd in the 
traditional African clothing she has worn for 35 years. Retired now, she was an 
employee of a major California corporation, and she proudly wore her heritage 
to work every day for 27 years. But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"People who didn't understand it couldn't accept it. They couldn't tell me not 
to, but they did little things to make me uncomfortable," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The clothing itself has always been comfortable and durable. Ifama has 
15-year-old garments from Africana Imports that "don't go out of style. I get 
compliments every time I walk out the door in them." And because she is "100% 
traditional," she always wears a head wrap "partly because it's a religious 
preference and partly because I think I look so darn good with it." 
</P>
<P>
"The crown of the head is very sacred and that's why it is always covered," 
explains South Africa-born Delphine Wills-Martin, a bookkeeper who makes the 
clothing and "crowns" she was selling at the most recent Afrikan Culture Day. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the occasion, she always puts on something that reflects her 
heritage, "even if it's just my jewelry or a hat or pants. To me, it's 
important. As a black person, it says something about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Using African fabrics, she turns them into "clothing that's practical for the 
office." A typical outfit might be "loose, comfortable pants with some type of 
wrap top and a tailored jacket." 
</P>
<P>
In the last month alone, requests for hats (traditionally worn by men but now a 
fashion favorite with both sexes) and outfits have increased considerably. 
"People are becoming more familiar and more educated about this type of dress. 
They realize there is an alternative to what they can find in the department 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
And they solve a problem for Wills-Martin, who says: "I don't think Western 
clothing is right for my body type. My hips are a lot bigger than my waist. 
Trying to wear Levi's is ludicrous. I'm just making things that are meant for 
me, that I've seen since I was a child." 
</P>
<P>
But for Jo Keita and Vicki Beya, mixing European-inspired fashion with African 
fabrics has turned into a lucrative business. Less than a year ago, the two 
invested $1,000 and planned to work only part time on their venture, called 
Nubian Princess. Now the unexpected demand for their garments, designed and 
made in the Ivory Coast, has them talking about a future filled with an 
extensive menswear line, a showroom and their own outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Customers for their "African high fashion" include a number of black 
celebrities who buy directly from Keita's home in Los Angeles. And at Sherie, a 
boutique in Beverly Hills, owner Sherie Wright says the colorful, unusual 
pieces sell well -- at $150 for a tie-dye shorts outfit, for example, or $370 
for a three-piece outift -- to "middle-class Anglo-Saxons who are looking for 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
The current interest in ethnic clothing reminds many, such as African dance 
teacher Tabula Adigun, of the '60s "when we wore the clothing of our 
ancestors." She wears both head-to-toe traditional as well as a mix, which 
might be a wrap skirt worn with a shirt, tie and boots. 
</P>
<P>
As the fashion industry continues its ethnic bent, Adigun predicts: "We're 
going to see more and more people with their hair wrapped in geles and wearing 
lappas. If you have your head wrapped," she explains, "you have to stand up 
proud." 
</P>
<P>
But even something as small as a bracelet "makes a statement of some sort. You 
either love the beauty of the work or it's part of your culture."

'BYRON,' BASH LAUNCH NEW CTG SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Center Theatre Group launched its 1989-90 season Wednesday night at the 
James A. Doolittle Theater in Hollywood with the American premiere of "Byron: 
Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know" -- a two-person show about the life of poet 
George Gordon, Lord Byron. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a crowd of 1,000 split into two groups: One attended a reception 
upstairs at the Doolittle, the other trekked to Ivar Street for a party in the 
Goldwyn Library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Excuse to Party 
</P>
<P>
The August Dog Days have brought their usual social drought, and guests of the 
CTG seemed happy to have an excuse to break out the power ties and pearls. 
Forty-five minutes before the show started, a crowd already had clogged the 
forecourt of the Doolittle. Unlike the usual scene at the Music Center, CTG 
power brokers slipped in virtually unnoticed, while TV stars were strobed by 
Instamatics and strafed with autograph books. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd seemed more diverse than usual, too, though many of the usual 
downtown suspects showed up, as well. Ahmanson producing director Gordon 
Davidson and his wife, Judi, were there; so were Music Center stalwarts like 
Esther and Tom Wachtell; Nancy and Alan Livingston; Robert Fryer; and Nancy and 
Tim Vreeland, who accepted condolences for the death of his mother the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing were: playwright Edward Albee, who will be directing the 
Ahmanson's next production, his "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"; "Woolf" star 
John Lithgow; "Byron" writer-director Jane McCulloch, and stars Derek Jacobi

It is, of course, the smash hit "Phantom of the Opera" that has forced the 
Ahmanson into temporary quarters at the Doolittle. Considering that the 
Ahmanson has 2,100 seats to the Doolittle's 1,000, has the shift affected the 
box office? "We're not sure yet," said Lawrence J. Ramer, CTG board president. 
"Our subscription season started fast, but we've still got another month before 
our first production moves in here."

Los Angeles designer Gregory Poe, who makes and peddles his pricey clothes in 
Japan, is setting the stage for his entry into the U.S. market -- literally. 
Poe, 32, designed the flashy costumes for "The Geography of Luck," a play 
opening today at the downtown Los Angeles Theatre Center. Set in Las Vegas, 
Poe's most spectacular female get-up is a Kelly green showgirl number, complete 
with satin, feathers, sequins and beaded headdress. Poe, who says he plans 
later this year to start selling his other designs in the United States, 
describes the "Geography" costume gamut as "anywhere from very glitzy showgirls 
to white trash." 
</P>
<P>
The Unusual Is His Usual 
</P>
<P>
Stylist to the stars Angelo di Biase has left his post at Umberto to become the 
style director at Char Salon. Di Biase is known for creating the unusual hair 
styles sported by Rosanna Arquette, Beverly D'Angelo and Ellen Barkin. His work 
will be seen in the movie "Johnny Handsome," featuring Barkin and Mickey 
Rourke. Di Biase will also be responsible for coiffures showcased in "Robocop 
II." Guess even robots need the right "do." 
</P>
<P>
Step Right Up, Folks 
</P>
<P>
Here's a new approach to hair salon protocol. At the Accent salon, clients are 
taken on a walk-in basis only. No appointments accepted. And those who wait 
more than 45 minutes for services are granted a 50% discount. There are seven 
of these shops in U.S. cities now, and there will be one in Los Angeles this 
year, says Mary Tingle, a spokeswoman for the company. They cater especially to 
the hair-care needs of black men and women, and use both Gentille and Nucleic A 
products, she tells Listen. 
</P>
<P>
Try to Patch That Up 
</P>
<P>
Looks like Tom Petty is into the hippie scene, judging from the decorative 
patches on his blue jeans. Listen caught sight of him the other night, with 
rocker Billy Idol close by. Idol isn't joining the Woodstock Revisited look, 
despite all the hoopla lately about this being the 20th year after. He's still 
wearing his ubiquitous black leather with fringe. This time he added a 
horsehide vest, complete with Pinto markings. What would the hippie vegetarians 
say about that?

LABOR LOGS OFFERED TO IMMIGRANT WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials have begun distributing a new booklet containing information 
designed to protect immigrant laborers from unscrupulous employers. 
</P>
<P>
The Worker's Rights Information booklet was developed by the Orange County 
Human Relations Commission to encourage workers to document pertinent 
information about their employers and to keep a log of the hours they work. 
</P>
<P>
The pocket-size booklets, printed in Spanish, also contain referrals for 
complaints about unpaid wages, unsafe working conditions, discrimination and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Five thousand of the booklets, printed with a grant from Pacific Bell, will be 
distributed at English language classes, places where day laborers congregate, 
churches and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet is a product of a recent hearing before the commission which 
documented widespread exploitation of immigrant labor.

REPORT: $14,934 SPENT AT EMERGENCY SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials spent $14,934 to operate emergency shelters for homeless 
people at two National Guard armories last winter, according to a new county 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The two armories were opened when temperatures dropped below 40 degrees or 
there was at least a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters were set up at the armories in Santa Ana and Anaheim 28 
times, and the cost of operating the shelters was paid for from the Homeless 
Shelter Charitable Trust Fund, which the county administers. 
</P>
<P>
County officials established the trust two years ago to receive donations and 
pay for emergency care for the homeless. About 5,980 homeless people were 
served meals or allowed to sleep overnight at the armories, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
County officials spent $4,614 on food and bedding at the shelters and nearly 
$10,320 on security. The armories again will be used this winter on an 
emergency basis to shelter homeless people.

'LIGHTNING' BIKE TEAM DROPS OUT NEAR END OF CROSS-COUNTRY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of bicyclists that included a San Juan Capistrano man zipped to victory 
after departing Orange County last weekend in the first cross-country test of 
high-tech bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Another team, featuring Seal Beach bike shop owner Greg Miller, abandoned the 
race Thursday with about 130 miles to go, despite leading most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Led by ultra-endurance cycling champ Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook and his 
brother, James, of San Juan Capistrano, the four-man squad took turns piloting 
a bike named Lightning to the finish line in New York City's Battery Park, 
covering the 3,000-mile race course in 5 days, 1 hour and 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The team, riding the bike Gold Rush America, was passed by Lightning on 
Thursday morning and then took a wrong turn onto a heavily traveled highway in 
Pennsylvania. The team members decided to pull out because of concerns for 
their safety in the traffic, according to Trisha Nerney, a spokeswoman for the 
Race Across America. 
</P>
<P>
Long a test of endurance for cyclists on traditional bikes, the Race Across 
America this year introduced a new division for such high-tech vehicles as 
Lightning and Gold Rush America. Pete Penseyres won the endurance test twice 
before switching to the "human-powered vehicle" division this year.

SENTENCING FOR 2 MURDERERS POSTPONED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sentencing for Cynthia Lynn Coffman and James Gregory Marlow, who received jury 
death verdicts for the murder of a young Redlands woman, has been postponed 
until Aug. 30 at the request of Coffman's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman and Marlow are scheduled to be brought to Orange County from San 
Bernardino after sentencing to stand trial in the murder of a young Huntington 
Beach woman who was killed Nov. 12, 1986, just five days after the Redlands 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman attorney Donald W. Jordan Jr. told San Bernardino County Superior Court 
Judge Don Turner on Thursday that he has not been able to complete a motion for 
a new trial that he has been preparing. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow's attorneys said their client is ready for sentencing but agreed to the 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Turner reminded the attorneys that they had assured him a month ago when he 
agreed to a similar postponement that they would be ready. But the judge agreed 
to the six-day continuance, warning them that it would be the last one he would 
tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, 26, and Marlow, 32, were convicted by a San Bernardino County jury in 
the murder of insurance clerk Corinna Novis, 20, who was kidnaped outside 
Redlands Mall and later strangled and dumped in a field near Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
If Turner confirms the jury's death verdict, which is usually a formality, 
Coffman would become the first woman sentenced to death in California since 
capital punishment was reinstated 12 years ago.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista man pleaded guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge related to two 
anti-abortion demonstrations at medical offices last spring. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Lehman Jr. pleaded guilty to one count of violating a federal court 
order that forbids illegal demonstrations by anti-abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
In the plea bargain, which was accepted by Municipal Judge Gale E. Kaneshiro, 
Lehman will be placed on probation for three years and receive a suspended 
sentence of 90 days in jail if he follows guidelines similar to those outlined 
in a federal court order issued in March. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman is ordered not to trespass, blockade, or direct others to participate in 
these activities, according Deputy City Atty. Lauri Stock, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be very clear to Mr. Lehman what he should and should not do," Stock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman will also be required to complete 180 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for his plea, the city attorney's office will drop conspiracy 
charges against Lehman, and it will not file a charge of resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the result of the negotiations with Mr. Lehman," said Stock, 
who emphasized that Lehman's right to free speech was not being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, who was acting as his own attorney, refused to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, who in court this week disavowed any affiliation with Operation 
Rescue, was one of eight demonstrators being charged with conspiracy by the 
city. In this case and the others, prosecutors allege that the eight conspired 
April 7 to break laws, one day before a demonstration at a Hillcrest Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, jury selection began Thursday in Municipal Court for two of Lehman's 
co-defendants charged with conspiracy. Their trial is expected to last about 
one month.

A 72-year-old East San Diego man was robbed and his 65-year-old neighbor raped 
by an armed robber. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victims returned at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday after eating dinner and 
the man went inside the house for a moment while the woman waited outside. The 
man was confronted by an armed robber who had entered the house through an open 
window. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police account of the incident, the robber held a gun to the 
victim's head and ordered him to call the woman inside. The assailant robbed 
the man of about $56, locked him in a back bedroom and raped the woman, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, the man took the rape victim to a hospital, where she was 
treated and released, and notified police.

ORANGE COUNTY FANS HAVE THEIR SAY ABOUT ROSE'S FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fans waiting to purchase Angels' tickets at Anaheim Stadium Thursday spoke out 
on Pete Rose's lifetime ban by Commissioner Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans said Rose got what he deserved for allegedly betting on Cincinnati 
Reds' games. Others said they didn't believe the charges. Nearly all seemed to 
feel sorry for Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Some sample comments: 
</P>
<P>
Bob Edwards of Fountain Valley: "It's about time they caught up with him. I 
support the suspension. He can always ask for reinstatement. I liked to watch 
him play. No (I don't feel he should be allowed back). 
</P>
<P>
"He was a grown man. He should have known better. He broke the cardinal rule. 
It's regretable. He's a national hero to a whole lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what he's done, you can't take away what he did (on the field as a 
player)." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ernst of Garden Grove: "He should have gotten suspended for five years. 
I think he should be able to come back too. I don't think he's going to come 
back. I'd like for him to. The odds aren't in his favor. He was a good baseball 
player, I'll give him that. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have know better, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Leavitt of La Habra: "He'll be back at the end of next year. They'll make 
him sit out this year. I think he should have gotten five years. I was 
originally thinking life. Five years would give him time to think. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not good for the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Borden of Agoura: "If he's guilty, it's not harsh, and I kind of figure he 
might be guilty. I think he made a deal. I think he'll be back next year. As a 
person, he's guilty. He's not too good as a person. He certainly deserves to 
keep his records. You can't take those away from him. You can't have the 
second-best records." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Caldwell of Tustin: "I think it's a little too harsh. Six months would 
have been plenty. (Should he be in the Hall of Fame?) No question about that. 
This has nothing to do with his ability on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Cummings of Placentia: "He played with fire and got burned. He knew what 
he was doing. He (Rose) did as much, added as much to baseball as any man has. 
That includes Babe Ruth. He made a mistake and now he has to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to see it. He was probably one of the greatest to ever come along. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be reinstated. I believe the suspension should last several 
years. I'm truly sorry. You have to draw the line somewhere. Just because he's 
a famous athlete, I'm not going to condone him for illegal actions. It's as 
simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sanchez of Upland: "I think he dedicated a lot of his time and effort 
to baseball and for one false move that hasn't ever been proven (in court), 
it's pretty severe. I've seen worse mistakes (in life). 
</P>
<P>
"They should consider what he's done." 
</P>

RECOVERING GAMBLERS OFFER ROSE ADVICE: SEEK HELP FOR ADDICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Bob W. finally decided to seek help six years ago, his gambling addiction 
had drained his $50,000 savings account and left him $32,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other recovering compulsive gamblers, the 47-year-old Anaheim 
businessman sees in himself the problems currently embroiling baseball great 
Pete Rose, who has been banned for life from the game by Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
And while the Cincinnati Reds manager has professed that he does not think he 
has a gambling problem, Bob, other recovering gamblers and experts in the field 
say that Rose exhibits an addict's classic denial. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same denial they say they went through before their gambling habits 
became so costly they had to try and quit. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's advice to Rose: "I think he should go to Gamblers Anonymous. But it's 
hard for anyone to say, 'Hey, I'm sick'. " 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3 million people nationwide have a gambling problem, said Richard 
Rosenthal, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist who heads the California Council on 
Compulsive Gambling. In Southern California, about 500 people -- many of them 
professionals -- regularly attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings, according to 
leaders of the groups. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator among all compulsive gamblers is that they are out of 
control, consumed by "the action," say former gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tell my wife I would play cards for two hours and I'd come back 30 
hours later," said Bob, who like several other members of Gamblers Anonymous 
declined to give their last names. 
</P>
<P>
"The family, the friends and the job all get in the way of gambling," added 
Bernie A., 50, a negotiator and recovering gambler from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie said that he refused to acknowledge he had a gambling problem until he 
lost his wife, his children and his home. Bernie said he attended his first 
Gamblers Anonymous meetings the same day he was so broke from gambling losses 
that he did not have enough money to get his clothes back from the cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
"Toward the end, my whole life was caught up in gambling," said Bernie, who was 
rendered penniless despite an annual income "in the six figures." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like I was in a fog all the time," he added. "It was horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Jim, 28, a salesman from Long Beach who has been attending Orange County 
Gamblers Anonymous meetings for nearly two years, said that he lived like a 
pauper -- despite making $90,000 a year -- because of his obsession with sports 
betting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bet on anything. I'd bet on games that I couldn't name two players on 
either team," he said. "I couldn't stop. It started off as a fun thing. But 
then it was more and more until I hit bottom." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Jim was 26, he said he had lost $400,000 to gambling and was 
$10,000 in debt at the time he finally decided to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Pete Rose has a problem," he said. "You start betting illegally with 
bookies (as Rose allegedly has done) and you've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, the psychiatrist, said that denial is "extremely common" among 
compulsive gamblers; even more than other addictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Since no substance is ingested with gambling, the denial is even stronger," 
Rosenthal said.

TERESCHUK TO COACH LAGUNA HILLS BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Hills High School has hired Pete Tereschuk to coach baseball, Athletic 
Director Dave Brown said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuk, junior varsity coach at Lakewood High School the past two years, 
replaces Jack Hodges, who resigned after 10 seasons to become baseball coach at 
Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuk was varsity coach at Long Beach Wilson from 1982-1987. He also has 
been an assistant at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he had a good combination of experience," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuk also will teach English and assist with the varsity football program, 
which Brown said was influential in his selection.

STRIKE UP THE (NEW) BAND; 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES RAMS HIRE NON-UNION MUSICIANS TO PLAY AT HOME GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an apparent effort to save money, the management of the Los Angeles Rams has 
switched from union to non-union musicians for home games. Robert W. Stava, 
secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Musicians Assn., said Rams management 
broke off negotiations with the union at the end of July when the union refused 
to cut the size of the existing band from 22 members to 15, which would have 
saved the Rams about $1,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Klein, the Rams' vice president for media and community relations, 
confirmed that the organization has a new band -- which, he said, has 22 
members. Klein referred any additional queries to Steve Novak, the Rams' 
general counsel, who did not return calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined how much the new musicians are being paid. Stava 
said the union members had received about $100 for each game, plus 
contributions to union benefit plans, which amount to about $25. The union had 
not asked for any increase in fees this season, Stava said. He said that the 
union, which had agreements with the Rams for the past 10 years, had been 
willing to discuss some staffing cuts, but that reducing the number to 15 "was 
going too far." 
</P>
<P>
The new band is being director by Larry Curtis, director of bands for Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The band performs in an end zone bandstand at the northeast end of the field, 
starting an hour before the game and playing during touchdowns and timeouts. 
The band also accompanies Rams cheerleaders during their routines. It does not 
march or perform at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the cheerleaders also danced to tapes made by the band. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said the cheerleaders now use some taped accompaniment for their 
routines which were not made by the new band.

<P>
COUNTRY FRENCH FOOD IS SOMETIMES UPTOWN; 
</P>
<P>
MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though country French cuisine is relatively simple to reproduce, surprisingly 
few restaurants do it justice. Overblown dishes suited to fancier dining rooms 
often crop up where a simple salad of white beans or a crusty tartine would do 
very nicely. And many of these restaurants feature menus that are so impressed 
with themselves that they forget to serve plain good food. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Peasant lives up to its name, at least partly. It is a pleasant 
place, if self-consciously so, with the type of decor you might be tempted to 
call Frilly Cottage -- e.g., knickknack wall mounts, flowery wallpaper, elegant 
table settings. The dining room reminds you of a gift store specializing in 
fancy imported soaps. As for the Peasant part of its name, it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Like many restaurants that are supposedly country French, The Pleasant 
Peasant's menu gets bogged down in dishes you wish it wouldn't bother with, 
such as le canard a l'orange, or supreme de volaille a la creme. And when the 
waitress asked me how crispy I liked my duck, I didn't realize that she was 
really asking me how long I wanted the thing frazzled in a deep fryer. The dish 
arrived sodden with grease, though the duck skin was crisp. And that orange 
sauce wouldn't have been out of place over shaved ice. 
</P>
<P>
As for the volaille, why take a perfectly good breast of chicken and smother it 
in a cream sauce thick enough to eat with chicken-fried steak? That may be 
country American, but it sure isn't country French. 
</P>
<P>
Look past these kinds of excesses, however, and the Pleasant Peasant may win 
you over. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering that all dinners 
are served with both soup and salad. (The salad is a bit perfunctory, but soups 
are especially fine.) 
</P>
<P>
One night there were three soups: a thick lentil, a smooth gazpacho and a homey 
corn chowder. Every one was flavorful, simple, and pure. Appetizers like 
l'assiette du Bistro (an equally simple plate of cold cuts and cheeses) also do 
a credible job. The tonier aubergine Chamonix (an eggplant gratin with ham and 
Swiss cheese under a rich, bubbly sauce) is less impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Among main dishes I can recommend are two lamb specialties, le carre d'agneau 
(a generous piece of lamb rack sprinkled with herbes de Provence) and le jarret 
d'agneau (lamb shank in white wine and tomato sauce). The rack I tasted was 
tender and full of flavor. The shank was fragrant with natural juices. 
</P>
<P>
I can't recommend the pot roast with shallots, however. The meat was soft but 
tasteless. And the sauce, sort of a thick brown glaze, was so sweet that I 
couldn't taste the meat. Don't fool with pastas here, either. Fusilli with 
vegetables was downright soggy, smothered in a thick creamy sauce that rendered 
it nearly inedible. 
</P>
<P>
La Brasserie in Orange has fewer problems than the Pleasant Peasant in the 
kitchen, but its advertised country French style rarely materializes. When it 
does, the result is good eating. 
</P>
<P>
It's a dark, elegant sort of place with copper pots hanging from the ceiling 
and a clubby, candlelit ambiance. It's also quite a bit pricier than most. The 
only informality is provided by some 19th-Century French poster art that 
wouldn't be out of place in a brightly lit cafe on the Boulevard St. Germain. 
But the menu is considerably more uptown. 
</P>
<P>
You're apt to notice a spate of veal dishes -- 10 to be exact. Marsala, Cordon 
Bleu and saltimbocca, for example, and also Continental staples such as lobster 
Newburg and caviar. You'll have a better, and certainly less expensive evening, 
if you avoid the luxuries here. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed that there were two foie gras appetizers, one advertised as a chicken 
liver mousse at $7.95, the other a goose liver terrine for $19.95. So I asked 
the cheerful French waiter if the more expensive one was really that much 
better. "Mais non," he replied under his breath, "the terrine is from a jar, 
and the mousse is made here." Naturally, the chicken liver mousse turned out to 
be great -- smoothly rich in a wonderful, homemade aspic. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, you can have onion soup from the menu at extra charge, or you can 
have the soup of the day with your dinner. Mine was a farmhouse vegetable soup 
served in a crock that was as country French as anything I had all week. It 
beat the onion soup to pieces. Should you prefer a salad (you don't get both 
here), it's made of bibb lettuce with a creamy tarragon vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
I had to search a bit for what I thought might be real country dishes, but the 
effort proved worthwhile. Coq au vin rouge is great here, a half-chicken that 
had been gently braised in a burgundy-colored sauce until it fell from the bone 
with smoky flavors. Calf's liver is wonderful, too -- pan fried crisp, 
luxuriously browned, and buried in butter and shallot. Both dishes are 
accompanied by garlicky diced potatoes and broccoli Hollandaise. They are, as 
the French say, worth a detour. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Peasant is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.25 to $10.50. Main 
courses begin at $8.50, and go up to $20. La Brasserie is moderate to 
expensive. Appetizers are $6.50 to $27.50. Main dishes are $13.95 to $23.95. 
Both restaurants have the predictable creme caramel, chocolate mousse, French 
pastry dessert menus. Desserts at the Pleasant Peasant run about 50 cents less 
than at La Brasserie, averaging about $3.50 apiece, and are not nearly as 
well-crafted.

NEWS BITES / BEVERLY BUSH SMITH: LOOKING TO DINE OUTDOORS? THE PATIO NEEDN'T BE 
YOURS

Summer's not over yet. If anything, in Orange County September often brings 
some of our warmest weather -- and with it, prime opportunity for outdoor 
dining. Last month we focused on sources for picnics; today, let's look at a 
sampling of restaurants that offer alfresco sipping and supping on their own 
patios, decks or terraces. 
</P>
<P>
For a serene lake view along with salads, sandwiches or hot entrees at 
lunchtime (dinner is for private parties only), try the Lakeside Restaurant in 
Orange, overlooking Eisenhower Lake. For coffee and a sweet roll starting at 8 
a.m. or light fare at noon, try Pumpernickel in the courtyard of Villa del Sol 
in Fullerton. Morning, noon or night, you can dine to the accompaniment of 
breaking surf on the deck at the Beach House in Laguna Beach. Watch the boat 
traffic on Newport Harbor while you taste the fresh seafood at the Warehouse in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For early California ambiance on the old Brisco family estate, step into the 
courtyard for Southwestern fare at the Hacienda in Santa Ana. Order from the 
new low-cholesterol menu on the patio at Antonello in South Coast Plaza 
Village. Savor Maine lobster every Sunday, beginning at 4:30 p.m. in Newport 
Beach, on Le Meridien Hotel's newly renovated Bistrot Terrasse (this airy 
retreat is a winner for lunch too). Lunch or dine with a peek at the ocean from 
the patio at Monique in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
There's more: Relax beside a cool Spanish fountain and order seafood and 
Continental dishes for lunch, Sunday brunch or dinner on the patio at Cafe 
Mozart in San Juan Capistrano. Overlook the golf course from the restaurant 
deck at Ben Brown's in Laguna. Introduce yourself to Mexican fare with Pueblo, 
Aztec, and Mayan accents on the walled patio at Salud! in Huntington Beach. 
Toss a cover-up over your bathing suit and refresh with light fare -- 
sandwiches (including a Mexican club), salads, hamburgers -- right on the beach 
at the Hotel Laguna Terrace, where they serve from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Order from a selection of California cuisine, daytime or evening, in a garden 
setting outside the Cabana Cafe overlooking the pool at the Four Seasons Hotel 
in Newport Beach. For strictly outdoors ocean-view dining with an extensive 
variety of fare, head for the bluff-top Village Market &amp; Cafe in Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, would you believe alfresco Chinese? You'll find it, lunch and 
dinner, on the patio at China Palms in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
COMING AND GOING: Ralf Marhencke has taken over as chef of the Dining Room at 
the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. The 24-year-old from Mainz, West Germany, 
served as sous-chef for the hotel's Cafe restaurant and banquet chef before his 
promotion . . . Guy Sockrider, formerly of the Inland Empire Sheraton, is now 
chef at Monique in South Laguna, where he has added several contemporary 
touches to the French cuisine, including salmon with orange butter and whole 
mustard seeds; ahi with sun-dried tomatoes and basil; Thai lemon chicken, and 
jumbo grilled scallops with lime, ginger and teriyaki . . . Claudio Arena 
replaces Enzo de Muro as manager of Tutto Mare in Newport Beach. De Muro will 
open his own restaurant in Long Beach. Gone, too, is Tutto Mare's executive 
chef, Andrea Rogantini. Tim Dobravolskis, who helped develop the restaurant's 
menu, currently has charge of the kitchen . . . The Maniacci brothers, busy 
preparing to open Sapori in Newport Beach on Sept. 9, have sold Capriccio in 
Mission Viejo to relatives, Edward Carroll and his mother, who will carry on 
with the same menu, same style . . . Artie and Biana Bavand, owners of La 
Trattoria in Irvine, will open a new restaurant at Chapman Avenue and Newport 
Boulevard in Orange this fall . . . Zeppa will move from the Newport Pier area 
to a much larger, 180-seat (plus patio) location in Fashion Island in November. 
Owner Mark Zigner promises a full bar, a cappuccino-espresso bar, gourmet 
takeout and California/Italian/Mediterranean cuisine. La Grappa will take over 
Zeppa's current location. 
</P>
<P>
WINING AND DINING: Gandhi in South Coast Plaza Village pairs Indian cuisine 
with French wines in a five-course winemaker's dinner on Sept. 25. Dinner is 
$30 per person and reservations may be made by calling (714) 556-7273 . . . The 
Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach launches a series of special Monday dinners with 
Garlic Night on Sept. 11. Rumor has it that besides serving bourride and 
chicken with 40 cloves of garlic, owner Tony Herrmann may be offering -- are 
you ready? -- garlic ice cream. The restaurant will feature paella on Sept. 18, 
German foods on Sept. 25 and vegetarian on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
PLENTIFUL GRAZING: Forty area restaurants will prepare samplings of their fare 
at Fashion Island for A Taste of Newport, a "Seafest" event to be held Sept. 15 
to 17. You'll find the festivities, plus live entertainment, in the parking lot 
next to Atrium Court. Hours will be 5 to 9 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Saturday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
BOUILLABAISSE FROM PROVENCE: Chef Sylvain DuParc of the Carlton Hotel in 
Cannes, France, will pay a special visit Sept. 15 through 22 to Le Meridien 
Hotel, Newport Beach, to prepare authentic French bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
Complete bouillabaisse dinners will be served in the hotel's Cafe Fleuri. 
DuParc's style is traditional, but adapted to the new lighter-is-better trend. 
DuParc will also participate in the hotel's booth at A Taste of Newport.

Congress and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimate the

approximately 3.9 million. More than 75% were Latin Americans and most of the 
rest were from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

<P>
There are 100 known street gangs in Orange County, with recorded members 
totaling more than 7,000. Although they are predominantly in Santa Ana, 
Westminster and Garden Grove, gangs also exist in Fullerton, La Habra, 
Placentia, and as far south as San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Each operates from a different power base. For example, Latino gangs' power 
base is territory, its expansion or protection. Asian gangs are 
profit-oriented; their crimes are theft, robbery, larceny, extortion and car 
theft. They operate in business districts and major shopping centers. Profit is 
also the motive for black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the county's gangs have an ethnic bias. "Orange County 
is an equal opportunity employer" when it comes to gangs, says Tom Wright, 
supervisor of the Gang Suppression Unit of the Orange County probation 
department. "Almost every gang is multiethnic, whites in black gangs, Asians in 
Latino gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mark Frank of the Westminster Police Department notes that Asian 
gangs don't follow the same patterns as the Latino and black groups. The Asian 
gangs don't wear tattoos or spray-paint their symbols, nor do they claim 
territory. They are mobile and mostly pay their visits to the Vietnamese 
business areas. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. David Salazar of the Santa Ana Police Department says the city has about 60 
street gangs, with 5,500 to 6,000 identified members. The crimes that have 
brought them to the attention of the police department include homicides, 
drive-by shootings, assaults, car theft, narcotics dealing and petty theft. 
Santa Ana has Latino, black, white and Asian gangs. 
</P>
<P>
And, Salazar reports, even the gangs have their acolytes. "In the last few 
years it's (gang membership) become somewhat of a fad," says Salazar, "with a 
lot of wanna-bes imitating gang members in dress" and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Rick Ritter says most gang members in the city of Fullerton, whether 
Latino, black or Asian, are locals and grew up together, attending the same 
schools, and that gang activity is more "like high school competitions, nothing 
like the scale of Santa Ana or Los Angeles." Some are second-, third- or 
fourth-generation gang members, and most of them get along in their multiethnic 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Their crimes are "beer runouts (running into a convenience market, picking up a 
six-pack and running out without paying), assaults," according to Ritter, not 
drive-by shootings or gang fights. There are hard-core gang members as well as 
associate gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Wright adds a new development in so-called "mutant" (a term Wright himself 
coined) or "hybrid" groups. These new gangs are "career crooks," Wright says, 
profit-oriented, very aggressive or violent, and some members are 14 years old, 
younger than traditional gangs. A typical Latino gang, for example, has members 
between the ages of 17 and 22. 
</P>
<P>
Mutant gangs seem to be a spontaneous spinoff, taking the best of the more 
established gangs -- such as the colors from the black gangs (red and blue 
rags) and the idea of territory from the Latino gangs. "They are going very 
much against the grain of gang culture," Wright says, and their methods have 
provoked confrontations with the established gangs.

Description: The adult burrowing owl is boldly spotted and barred. Long legs 
distinguish this ground dweller from all other small owls. Its round head and 
tuftless ears also aid in identification. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Prefers flat, open land. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Large insects, rodents and lizards. Primarily a nocturnal hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Display: Often seen in daylight outside burrow or on fence post, where it 
bounces and bobs. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: This owl adopts abandoned burrows of ground squirrels and other 
</P>
<P>
small mammals, occasionally enlarging them by kicking dirt backwards. The nest 
chamber is usually lined with cow chips, horse dung, food debris, dry grass, 
weeds, pellets or feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White and nest-stained, about 1.2 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: In competition with developers for flat, open land, the 
burrowing owl has lost much of its Orange County habitat and is greatly reduced 
in numbers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
AT TOURNAMENT, ANGLERS AIM TO BOOST AWARENESS, NOT THE HARVEST, OF VULNERABLE 
MAKO SHARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT OSTMANN JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 boats will head out to sea from Orange County and other parts of 
Southern California early Saturday in search of mako sharks. 
</P>
<P>
But the hunters in those boats won't be looking for steaks or a trophy to stuff 
and hang on the den wall. Any makos they are skillful or lucky enough to catch 
will be fitted with a small numbered tag and set free. On the tag is a request 
that any angler who catches the shark notify the state Department of Fish and 
Game, which is tracking the makos' growth and migration patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the United Anglers of Southern California, the two-day mako 
tag-and-release tournament is an effort to gather information about the 
little-understood mako and raise public awareness about what many feel is an 
imminent danger to the shark fishery. 
</P>
<P>
"I started fishing makos about 10 years ago," said Greg Stotesbury of Newport 
Beach, who will be one of those on the water this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Until a few years ago, there were only four or five guys around here fishing 
them. But people discovered that they tasted good, and combined with a lack of 
other big-game fish recently, interest in makos has exploded." 
</P>
<P>
Although Stotesbury and others are worried about the effect of unrestricted 
sport fishing on the shark population, they are most concerned about an 
emerging commercial mako shark fishing industry in an area bounded roughly by 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, Santa Catalina Island and Point Loma in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the state Fish and Game Commission allowed 10 commercial boats 
to begin fishing for makos with "long lines" -- four-mile-long cables strung 
every 15 feet with baited hooks, a very efficient method of catching sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of their catch has been makos, 60% blue sharks, the rest 
assorted other fish. The makos are sold to restaurants and fish dealers. The 
blues are mostly discarded. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of the makos caught are very young fish, according to 
John Sunada, associate marine biologist with the state Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
"We rarely see any makos here older than 3 or 4. The sub-adults tend to hang 
out here together for a while before going somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Sunada said state biologists are developing a theory that the coastal waters 
between the mainland and Catalina are a rearing ground for very young mako 
sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Sunada said some makos tagged in the "nursery" area have been caught later off 
Baja, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that this kind of shark is vulnerable to overfishing and can be 
overfished quickly. We're taking a very slow and cautious approach." 
</P>
<P>
Sunada said the Fish and Game Commission, which approved the experimental 
commercial mako fishery, will decide later this year whether to continue it, 
expand it or cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know more about the fish before that decision can be made," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stotesbury and others who this year formed Concerned Shark Fishermen of 
Southern California say the state already has allowed for greater fishing of 
makos than is prudent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that if they start taking the nursery stock out, the fishery 
will collapse," he said. "You'll catch a lot of sharks for a while and then, 
because they reproduce so slowly, nothing. Boom and bust." 
</P>
<P>
Although no figures are available on the shark population in local waters, 
Stotesbury and other Orange County shark fishermen say they have seen a 
dramatic decline in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Blower of Newport Beach has been fishing for makos for more than eight 
years. He stalks them alone in a 22-foot boat called Mako Mad. This year he's 
seen fewer makos than in any previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The mako is "the most exciting fish that swims," Blower said. "But I began 
tagging and releasing them three years ago when I realized all these sharks are 
juveniles. Allowing commercial fishing in an area like this is like opening 
deer season for fawns." 
</P>
<P>
The sport fishermen opposed to the commercial harvest of makos say history has 
shown that when a specific shark is targeted, its numbers are devastated. They 
are concerned that the mako will go the way of the thresher and soupfin sharks, 
species that were once plentiful in Southern California waters but, after 
intensive commercial fishing, now are seldom seen. 
</P>
<P>
"The mako fishery is too precious," Stotesbury said. "We need to be more 
conservative until we understand the biological impact of taking large 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Stotesbury and his group are lobbying the state Fish and Game Commission to end 
the commercial shark permits next year. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the numbers of sharks taken by sport fisherman are tiny compared to 
the commercial haul, Stotesbury and his group have also recommended to the 
state a two-shark-per-day limit for recreational anglers. Now there are no 
limits on size or number. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to err on the side of conservation, not exploitation," Stotesbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his group is also assisting state marine biologists in tagging and 
releasing sharks so information can be accumulated on their movements and 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working hard to discourage the Rambo kind of attitude out there. We're 
telling our members they've got to release these fish." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shanahan of Dana Point, a shark sportfishing boat skipper who participates 
in the tag-and-release program, said he would support increased regulation of 
sport shark fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put a tax on catching sharks, a surcharge on your license or whatever. 
That would satisfy the state and generate money for research and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do what it takes because the mako fishery could already be damaged 
beyond repair in my generation."

LOCAL SHARKS AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ocean off Orange County is home to a number of deep-water shark species, 
including the great white, hammerhead and thresher. 
</P>
<P>
The most common species, however, are the blue and the mako. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Shark (Prionace Glauca) 
</P>
<P>
The most numerous sharks in local waters based on sightings and captures. 
Present year-round. Rarely seen near shore. No estimates of population. 
</P>
<P>
Long slender body, typically five to six feet long, but reported as large as 12 
feet. Most in the area are under 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Distinctive cobalt-blue coloring on top, fading to iridescent blue at the 
sides. White on the bottom. Triangular teeth with serrated edges. 
</P>
<P>
Feeds on squid, anchovies, sardines. Also garbage, larger fish and other 
sharks. Has attacked humans. 
</P>
<P>
Generally moves slowly, snaking through water near the surface. Can achieve 
great bursts of speed when attacking. 
</P>
<P>
Mako Shark (Isurus Oxyrinchus) 
</P>
<P>
Closest cousin to the great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
Common in coastal waters between mainland and Santa Catalina Island from June 
to October. Rarely seen near shore. 
</P>
<P>
Sleek but not as streamlined as the blue shark. Grows to 12 feet. Most in the 
area are under 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gray to brownish-blue coloring on top fading to white on bottom. Long, narrow, 
smooth-edged, inward curving teeth designed for impaling fish. 
</P>
<P>
Feeds on mackerel, tuna, swordfish, other sharks. Has attacked humans. 
</P>
<P>
Very aggressive and fast. Capable of swimming 35 m.p.h. and can jump well clear 
of the water. Known to attack boats.

SINGLE LIFE: LETTING GO: NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR CAN END A FRIENDSHIP -- FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Life.

Marsha and Melinda befriended one another at their first job. They were both 
22, just starting their careers, unattached and new in town. Marsha had moved 
from San Diego to Irvine for her entry-level position as a marketing assistant; 
Melinda had relocated from Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
They quickly discovered that they had a lot in common -- they shared a similar 
sense of humor, they had similar tastes in men, they had similar family 
backgrounds and past experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost eerie to find someone so much like me," Marsha recalls. "We took 
turns complaining about our domineering-yet-lovable moms. We both had jerky, 
philandering boyfriends in college. We liked and disliked the same movies, the 
same clothes, the same colors, the same food." 
</P>
<P>
Neither woman felt at home yet in Orange County -- their old friends, relatives 
and familiar haunts were a long freeway drive away. So they bonded together, 
like tourists in a foreign land. "We spent every weekend exploring our new 
surroundings," Marsha says. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the pair soon became best friends. A few months later they 
combined their resources and rented an apartment much nicer than either could 
afford alone. They car-pooled to and from the office, until each went on to 
another workplace a year later. 
</P>
<P>
For the next six years, Marsha and Melinda were as inseparable as teen-age 
sweethearts. They saw the world together -- Europe, Hawaii, Mexico, New York. 
They faithfully reserved at least one weekend night for each other. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were dates -- plenty of them. "But nothing serious," Marsha says. 
"We always egged each other on -- 'he's cute, go for him' -- but secretly, I 
think, we both lived in fear that the other person would get a boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after six years of constant companionship, it happened. A man came 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda had a few dates with a nice guy. "I thought, 'Eh, she'll blow him off; 
he's not her type,' " Marsha says. Then Melinda had a few more dates with the 
nice guy and started speaking fondly of him. "I panicked," Marsha says. "I hate 
to admit it, but I hoped for the worst. I hoped he'd dump her so that things 
could go back to the way they were before." 
</P>
<P>
But instead, Melinda's romance just kept getting stronger. She quit saving a 
weekend night for Marsha. She quit accompanying Marsha to parties, where the 
two women once played off one another in flirting with men. She quit going on 
vacations with Marsha. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Melinda announced that she was moving in with her boyfriend. A few 
months later, the couple became engaged. 
</P>
<P>
"My entire life was upended," Marsha confesses. "I'd never realized how totally 
dependent I was on Melinda. I couldn't even feel happy for her, I was so 
jealous. It was as if she had divorced me. 
</P>
<P>
"To make matters worse, the fact that Melinda could just up and commit to 
someone made me feel that something was wrong with me. For years I could think, 
'Well, it's not so weird that I haven't fallen in love; neither has Melinda, 
and she's not weird.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jealousy, says Newport Beach psychotherapist Pat Allen, is a normal feeling. 
"But when it manifests itself in negative behavior, it becomes unhealthy," she 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
"Negative behavior" can include dwelling on your own loneliness rather than 
celebrating your friend's triumph. "Healthy friends will rejoice in each 
other's success," Allen explains. "But if they're clinging together in a 'we 
can do together what we cannot do separately' bond, one of the partners will 
lose her ammo when her friend leaves her for a man. Not only has she lost her 
friend, she's lost her social vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Women more often than men tend to react enviously toward other people's 
relationships -- an ancient remnant of the pre-lib attitude that women derive 
their status from their husbands. "Men are more competitive about material 
things -- job titles, power, prestige," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
Whether at the workplace or in relationships, both sexes rate their progress 
against their peers. "There's a thing called the social clock, which we all use 
to monitor what we are supposed to accomplish by 25, by 30, by 35, by 40 and so 
on," says Bob Stohr, Allen's assistant and an intern therapist. "There's a lot 
of social pressure dictating when you're supposed to be married, especially for 
women, because they have to deal with the biological issues of childbearing." 
</P>
<P>
As in Marsha's case, jealousy can erupt when a person negatively compares 
herself -- and then fears that her friend's achievement underscores her 
shortcomings. "She might think, 'How dare my friend do what I'm afraid to do. 
How dare she be intimate and allow herself to be vulnerable. I'm not ready for 
that,' " Stohr says. "It's like putting the spotlight on her deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Stohr points out that because people are marrying later, they are more apt to 
form close same-sex friendships in the meantime. "These days, we are putting a 
lot of energy into friendships until we find an intimate relationship," he 
says. "I call that kind of friend 'the surrogate lover.' 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose a surrogate lover to a romantic relationship, there is a 
profound sense of loss. It's like, 'Wait a minute, we had this unwritten 
contract that we were going to be there for each other, and now you've deserted 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
While good friends are good to have, Allen suggests that one person not 
over-invest in another. Single friends looking for marriage probably will not 
be there for you, 100%, the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever your world is so small that you only have one or two people in it, 
you're putting your support system in imbalance," she says. "Diversify. Have a 
person to play with in each area of your life -- someone to go to the museum 
with, someone to go skiing with, someone to go to movies with. That way, when a 
friend leaves you in a significant way -- whether it's death or marriage or 
whatever -- you'll have other friends to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
Allen says that relinquishing a close friend to romance unleashes the normal 
stages of grief: "First there's denial: 'Their relationship won't last.' Then 
there's anger and resentment: 'You abandoned me; I don't like you anymore.' And 
finally there's resignation: 'All right, you're married. What are we going to 
do with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marsha has entered the final stage of the grieving process. She sees Melinda, 
who married last June, once every two or three weekends. "At last I'm able to 
feel happy for her, even though I'm still not happy about losing her as a 
roommate and a confidante," Marsha says. "I get nostalgic for the good old 
days." 
</P>
<P>
She no longer considers Melinda her best friend. "It's funny -- so much of our 
friendship was based on the fact that we were both single," Marsha says. "Now 
there's a gulf between us. I have to say that she hasn't made a lot of effort 
to maintain our friendship. But then again, she's in love. She's still sort of 
in a fog, which I imagine will pass as she starts putting the elements of her 
life in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
How did Marsha overcome her post-Melinda depression? "I found another best 
friend," she says.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin E. Consey, the director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport 
Beach, has been named to head the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Consey, 38, who has headed the Newport Beach museum for six years, will assume 
his new post Nov. 15, according to Paul Olivier-Hoffman, chairman of the 
Chicago museum board. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum is in the midst of a $50-million campaign to 
establish an endowment and to build a facility designed by architect Renzo 
Piano. Consey will head a similar campaign in Chicago, according to museum 
officials there. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, Olivier-Hoffman said Consey "represents the new 
generation of museum directors, combining uncompromising artistic vision with 
strong management skills and capital campaign experience." 
</P>
<P>
Consey, who was paid $85,000 a year in Newport Beach, called the appointment 
"one of the most coveted museum directorships to open in the last decade."

A South Los Angeles house fire sparked by a smoldering cigarette killed a man, 
his wife and their 8-year-old boy, and injured two other children who were 
overcome by smoke in their sleep, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The house, on the 700 block of West 138th Street, was not equipped with smoke 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving victims, a girl, 14, and a boy, 12, were in extremely critical 
condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The five victims, who were not immediately identified, were carried out of 
their bedrooms by firefighters who entered the smoke-filled home, City Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said.

Plans were unveiled today for a controversial retail and office complex in 
Sherman Oaks that would replace a 46-year-old row of one-story storefronts, 
including the popular Scene of the Crime mystery bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, attorney for the developer, Jama Construction Corp., said 
the three-story center, on the 13600 block of Ventura Boulevard, would be about 
85,000 square feet and have two levels of underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
The complex would be oriented to pedestrians, Reznik said. A large open 
courtyard in the center would provide access to shops and restaurants on the 
ground floor. He said the complex would be designed so traffic from Ventura 
Boulevard would not extend into the adjoining residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no tenants planned at this time," Reznik said. "The developer has 
not had time to solicit anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in the area oppose the project because of its size and its effects 
on the neighborhood. Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo has called for an 
environmental impact report on the project, saying it would create an 
"out-of-scale development" in Sherman Oaks.

Salman Rushdie, the novelist threatened with death by the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini for writing the book "The Satanic Verses," is living apart 
from his American wife, Marianne Wiggins, she announced today through her 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Secker and Warburg issued a brief statement saying that Wiggins, herself a 
writer, and the Indian-born Rushdie have been living separately for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Scotland Yard security arrangements for the protection of Mr. Rushdie have 
been reordered since then and Ms. Wiggins does not know where he is," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Khomeini said Rushdie should 
be killed because "The Satanic Verses" blasphemes Islam.

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu handed a key Cabinet job to a woman today, hours 
after its holder resigned in a flap over an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
Mayumi Moriyama, 61, director-general of the Environment Agency, was named to 
replace Tokuo Yamashita, 69, as chief Cabinet secretary, a highly visible post 
that includes speaking on behalf of the government and coordinating Cabinet 
affairs. She is the first woman ever to hold the post. 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita's is the second sex scandal to hit the conservative Liberal 
Democratic Party in two months. Sosuke Uno announced his resignation as prime 
minister in July amid allegations he had an extramarital affair with an 
ex-geisha. 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama's appointment was widely seen as intended to contain damage caused by 
the latest scandal, but analysts and party officials expressed doubt about 
whether she has enough experience to handle the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just appointed, and I can't really tell what it is going to be like," 
she said in a news conference. "But as far as my near 40-year professional 
experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps for being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita announced his resignation this morning after apologizing for an 
extramarital affair with a bar hostess 43 years younger than he is.

Japan's Defense Agency, citing a continued threat from the Soviet Union, today 
asked for an increase in spending next year to cover new ships, tanks and 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials said they also needed a 6.35% increase in the annual budget 
starting April 1 to shoulder a bigger share of the cost of keeping U.S. troops 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The budget request is for $29 billion, up $1.7 billion over the current year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Agency wants to buy 30 newly developed tanks, 112 aircraft and 21 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also plans to spend $305 million to cover 52% of the total cost of wages 
and fringe benefits for the 22,OOO Japanese employed by the U.S. military, up 
from 43%. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has been pressing Japan to take on more of the burden 
of its own defense, will pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Total Japanese spending on the U.S. military, including facilities, would rise 
to $1.2 billion under the proposed budget, up 16.7% over the current fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Juro Matsumoto said the budget took into account "accumulated" 
Soviet military power in the region.

MAZOWIECKI IN PLEA TO VISITOR DOLE, SEEKS TO ALLAY MOSCOW'S FEARS

<P>
Poland's new prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, appealed today for rapid aid 
from the United States to help solve his country's pressing economic problems 
and tried to allay fears in Moscow over the historic change in power. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, formerly a senior adviser to the Solidarity trade union and editor 
of its newspaper, made the plea for aid to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas during talks in Warsaw one day after he became the first non-Communist 
prime minister in Eastern Europe in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki has said he needs aid from abroad to help tackle runaway inflation, 
a $39-billion debt and growing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked that we carry to (President Bush) that . . . he who helps early helps 
twice (as much)," Dole told reporters in the Council of Ministers, the 
government's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, this is very important now to keep up the momentum and let the 
Polish people see some change," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, who arrived in Warsaw with his wife, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole, after a trip to the Soviet Union, did not specify what aid Mazowiecki 
asked for nor say whether Washington intended to give extra money to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we do have a budget deficit at home. Then we will provide aid as we 
can, when we can, but there is already a significant program under way," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Pledge Recalled 
</P>
<P>
Bush pledged during a visit to Poland in July to provide $119 million in 
economic aid. Congress will consider legislation next month that would grant 
the aid and several key lawmakers have said they would like to increase the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said he discussed with Mazowiecki how Polish workers could be affected by 
radical economic reforms and said Washington will send a team of experts to 
determine urgent needs. 
</P>
<P>
"This transition . . . is obviously going to create difficulties before the 
benefits are produced," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki also held talks with Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov and sought 
to allay concern in Moscow over the change in government. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet sources said Mazowiecki gave assurances that Poland will remain a 
reliable ally and will stay in the Warsaw Pact military alliance. He praised 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki's election by Parliament on Thursday shattered the Communist 
domination of Eastern Europe.

Pilots from major competitors are volunteering to stage a wildcat work stoppage

Sept. 4 is Labor Day, a heavy travel day.

"It's called 'Shut Down America,' " said Hank Weber, a spokesman for the 
Eastern local of the Air Line Pilots Assn. "It's one of those things. We've 
never had anything from the grass roots like this before. All we can do is 
watch and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Weber said the union isn't organizing the effort and has no details but has 
been flooded with messages of support. He showed messages from pilots for such 
airlines as United, Northwest, TWA and Aloha. 
</P>
<P>
One message called for "S.O.S. -- Suspension of Service; Sick-Out in September. 
. . . Are you sick of what's happening to our Eastern brothers?"

demanding the annulment of a $470-million settlement India reached with Union 
Carbide Corp.

Several petitions are pending in India's highest court of appeal over the

multinational's pesticide plant.

A three-member Supreme Court panel ordered the central Madhya Pradesh

The worst drought since 1976 is wiping out crops and pastures in southern and 
western France but wine producers said today the scorching summer is the best 
news they have had in years. 
</P>
<P>
While angry farmers are turning violent to squeeze more compensation out of the 
government, the vineyards are predicting a vintage year. 
</P>
<P>
Helped by the longest dry spell in 13 years, growers in the Muscadet area of 
western France began picking their grapes today -- three weeks earlier than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
"The seasonal temperatures and the amount of sunshine have been very favorable 
for the vines. (The year) 1989 will definitely be a great year, like '47, '59 
and '76," said Marcel Martin, chairman of the winegrowers' guild of the Pays de 
Loire. 
</P>
<P>
"The grape is perfectly golden. The wine will be supple, clear and fruity," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the coast, growers in the Bordeaux region say they will start 
picking grapes for white Graves wine at the end of the month. Producers of red 
St. Emilion will start from Sept. 4, about 10 days early.

APPLIANCE SALES DECLINE, GE TO LAY OFF 800

<P>
General Electric Co. said today that its appliance group, faced with declining 
sales, will lay off at least 800 workers. 
</P>
<P>
GE Group Executive Roger Schipke said in an interview that the permanent 
layoffs will be spread through the giant conglomerate's appliance operations 
from now through October. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest impact, he said, would be at GE's big manufacturing plant in 
Louisville, Ky. The Louisville complex, which produces laundry equipment and 
refrigerators, is GE's headquarters for major appliances. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go further in cutting costs than we ever dreamed we'd have to in a 
short period of time," Schipke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsold Appliances 
</P>
<P>
He said GE has a warehouse full of unsold appliances at the Louisville complex 
and "we even have some in public warehouses." 
</P>
<P>
GE's action comes after major layoff announcements at Eastman Kodak &amp; Co. 
and Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak said Wednesday that it would cut 4,500 jobs, or around 3% of its work 
force. Campbell on Thursday said that it would slash 2,800 jobs, or nearly 6% 
of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
The precise number of job cuts at GE will not be known until this month's sales 
figures are in, Schipke said. But the figures "look weaker than July's," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union Workers on List 
</P>
<P>
Among the 800 to lose their jobs, 500 will be union workers and the remainder 
will be salaried staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisville appliance complex has 12,800 workers, 9,000 of whom are union 
employees. In 1973, a peak year for appliance sales, total employment at 
Louisville was 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairfield, Conn.-based GE has a staff of about 298,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company is involved in aircraft engines, aerospace, plastics, 
medical systems and broadcasting through its National Broadcasting Co. 
subsidiary, the name GE represents household appliances to many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
GE last May said it would phase out 400 jobs in oven-range production at 
Louisville in the next few years.

SALES OF EXISTING HOMES UP 1.2% IN JULY, REALTORS SAY

<P>
Sales of existing homes rose 1.2% in July, posting the first back-to-back 
increase after high mortgage rates produced consecutive declines in the first 
five months of 1989, a real estate trade group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million units in July, up from 
June's revised 3.36 million units. 
</P>
<P>
June's increase was the first in sales since December, 1988, and the largest 
since December, 1986, when sales jumped 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"The downswing in (mortgage interest) rates is pulling some buyers off the 
sidelines," said NAR President Ira Gribin. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that average fixed-rate mortgages 
fell from 10.03% to 9.81% during July. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors also reported that the median price of a home rose $3,000 to 
$96,400, a 3.2% increase over June and 6.3% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The median price reflects the dominance of higher-priced home sales, said NAR 
chief economist John A. Tuccillo, and "a relatively low volume of sales in the 
lower-priced starter range." 
</P>
<P>
"The loss of the entry-level buyer is taking a bite out of the market," Gribin 
added. 
</P>
<P>
But while the July increase in sales was small, said Lyle Gramley, chief 
economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, "taken in the context of 
all other recent economic indicators, it's got to be encouraging. I think we'll 
see more moderate rises as the year goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales were led in the Northeast, where the resale pace rose 9.8% to 
560,000 units. Next was the South, which recorded a 3.1% increase to 1.32 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, however, sales fell 5% to 570,000 units. Sales also dropped in the 
Midwest, 5.2% to 910,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
Median prices were $147,000 in the Northeast, $88,200 in the South, $138,200 in 
the West and $73,500 in the Midwest.

U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, citing a neck injury sustained while hanging 
up the telephone from his hotel bed, dropped out of the World Series of Golf 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to damage myself," Strange said after withdrawing playing 
nine holes in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Strange's withdrawal eliminated him from consideration for the Vardon Trophy, 
presented to the PGA Tour player with the lowest scoring average for a minimum 
of 60 rounds. To be eligible, a player must complete every competitive round he 
starts. The withdrawal also hinders his hopes of repeating as PGA Player of the 
Year and of earning his third consecutive money-winning title. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging up the phone," Strange said in explaining the injury sustained 
Thursday morning. "I was stretching and something popped and I couldn't get out 
of it. I couldn't even get back down on the pillow. I don't know how I got out 
here to the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Strange struggled to an opening-round 6-over-par 76 Thursday and was 5-over for 
his nine holes today.

The U.S. basketball team, led by Larry Johnson's 21 points and 13 rebounds and 
helped by a strong bench, overwhelmed Poland 128-75 at the World University 
Games today. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans finished the preliminary round of the 16-team competition 3-0 and 
will face Israel in Saturday's quarterfinals. Israel lost to West Germany 85-71 
but advanced to the quarterfinals as second in its group. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start that saw Poland take a 10-9 lead, the U.S. team went on a 
20-2 run led by its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Americans a 29-12 edge. With their starting five returning to the 
floor, the Poles closed the gap to 42-35. 
</P>
<P>
But the bench again helped the U.S. team take a 55-39 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans scored 18 of the first 20 points after halftime and cruised home. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a power forward from Odessa Junior College who will transfer to 
Nevada-Las Vegas in the fall, was the top U.S. scorer for the third time in as 
many games in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, already eliminated from the quarterfinals, produced the first big upset 
of the basketball tournament, edging the Soviet Union 77-76. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the Soviets, who finished 2-1 in their group, advanced to the 
quarterfinals. The Soviets had been expected to be the chief rival for the 
United States in the gold-medal game, but have been lackluster so far. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, the defending champion, also struggled in beating Cuba 79-76, but 
joined the Americans and the West Germans in the quarterfinals as the third 
team with a 3-0 record. Cuba also advanced.

VALVANO TOLD TO RESIGN AS N.C. STATE AD;

University of North Carolina System President C. D. Spangler today called on 
North Carolina State basketball Coach Jim Valvano to quit as athletic director 
and said the "status quo is not good enough" in the school's basketball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said he wanted Valvano to resign as athletic director no later than 
Dec. 31. Valvano said Thursday he would resign if asked to do so, but there was 
no immediate comment from him today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the athletic director be in an unambiguous position," 
Spangler said. "Mr. Valvano has served without pay in this position . . . but I 
believe that is a responsibility he should not carry along with his duties as a 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Academic Integrity' 
</P>
<P>
"My foremost concern has been with the issue of academic integrity," Spangler 
said, adding that he also wanted booster clubs -- such as N.C. State's Wolfpack 
Club -- to make public their annual audits. 
</P>
<P>
No violations of NCAA rules have been found by a four-man commission he 
appointed to probe allegations about the men's basketball program, Spangler 
said. But the spirit of the system was violated, he added, through the use of 
"incomplete" grades to allow players to remain technically eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The system has been misused," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The book "Personal Fouls," by Peter Golenbock, sparked a six-month 
investigation into the basketball program at N.C. State. Allegations in the 
book included improper changes of grades for basketball players, improper 
payments and lavish gifts to athletes, drug abuse and concealment of drug test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said more than 160 people were interviewed by his commission. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State Chancellor Bruce Poulton resigned Monday, and was not among 
university chancellors attending today's meeting of the University of North 
Carolina Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NCAA Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also has investigated the men's basketball program at N.C. State and 
that report is expected in the fall, Spangler said. Poulton and Valvano 
requested the report. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano was expected to attend a meeting later today of the N.C. State 
University Board of Trustees in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said nothing was found to support allegations of lavish gifts and 
payments to players. But he said there were some rule violations in "the 
disposition of tickets issued to players" that have been reported to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
He said an effort was being made to "see that the problem will not reoccur." 
</P>
<P>
Spangler also said players had been found trading extra basketball shoes to a 
local store and that players had received discounts "at a local restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also checked summer employment by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said the commission found that a player was employed by a firm hired 
by Valvano, but that the situation had been authorized by the Atlantic Coast 
Conference.

Swedish hockey star Mikael Lindholm could be suspended from playing in Europe 
for life and sued with breach of contract if he decides to continue his career 
with the Los Angeles Kings, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Lindholm, 24, who has played two years for Brynas and was under contract with 
the Swedish Elite League club, signed a two-year deal with the Kings earlier 
this summer. But the June 30 deadline for transfers between Sweden and the NHL 
had already passed when he signed the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Brynas asked for $121,000 in compensation but reportedly will not receive 
anything from the Kings, the Aftonbladet newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikael is tied by a contract with Brynas, and the NHL has honored those 
throughout the years. I think (NHL President) John Ziegler will stop this," 
Swedish Hockey Federation President Richard Fagerlund was quoted by Aftonbladet 
as saying. Fagerlund said he met Ziegler in London last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Lindholm, a winger, says he will travel to Ottawa next Sunday to join the 
Kings' preseason training camp despite risking a lifetime ban from playing in 
Europe.

A former head of the Canadian Track and Field Assn. denied allegations today 
that he ignored evidence about steroid use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Wilf Wedmann told a federal inquiry he could not act on allegations that Ben 
Johnson and other Canadian athletes were taking steroids because he never had 
the evidence -- namely, athletes and coaches willing to testify for the record. 
</P>
<P>
"We need people on the record. We need people that can be put before a hearing 
to testify to that effect," Wedmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedmann also said he did not have the authority to authorize a "sting" 
operation to set a trap for Johnson.
