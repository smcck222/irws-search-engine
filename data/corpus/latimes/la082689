POLITICAL ACTIVIST NEIL GOOD DIES; LEAVES VOID IN GAY COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Neil Good, a longtime San Diego political activist whose narrow loss in a 1987 
City Council race brought pride and a growing sense of clout to the city's gay 
community, died late Thursday of complications related to hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
Good, a former journalist who served as a top aide to several Democratic 
officeholders and was active in a wide range of civil rights and civic 
organizations, died at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital of liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken man with a rapid-fire, often self-effacing sense of humor, the 
41-year-old Good had become ill only one month ago. After being diagnosed with 
hepatitis, he spent several weeks at home resting, but entered the hospital two 
weeks ago when his condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Beck, a close friend and spokesman for Good's family, said doctors 
determined that his death was not AIDS-related. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the shock is that it all happened so fast," said Nikki Symington, 
president of the public relations firm of Grossman Symington &amp; Good, which 
Good joined 1 1/2 years ago. "My first thought today was, if Neil were here, 
he'd think of something really funny to say about the whole thing. I wish I 
could do that. But I just can't think of anything witty to say today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Severe Leadership Vacuum 
</P>
<P>
Good's death, coupled with the AIDS-related deaths of other prominent 
homosexual leaders within the past year, leaves what several gay activists 
described Friday as the most severe leadership vacuum within the gay community 
in nearly two decades. In November, physician Brad Truax, for a decade a 
preeminent spokesman for San Diego's homosexual community, died. Three months 
later, Doug Scott, former president of the San Diego Democratic Club -- the 
largest Democratic club in the county, gay or otherwise -- died. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community is in shock and has an incredible void at the top," said 
longtime gay activist Nicole Murray. "When Brad died, Neil was the logical one 
to turn to. Now, I can't even think of one person to turn to. The second tier 
in our community isn't even close to what we had in Brad and Neil. They're 
irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
"I see no one on the horizon who can duplicate either Brad Truax or Neil Good, 
especially their experience, drive and effectiveness in being a spokesman for 
the community," said Chris Kehoe, who served as Good's 1987 campaign 
coordinator. "Neil had a long history of dealing with city and county officials 
and the kind of credibility that no one else can match." 
</P>
<P>
A New Hampshire native who moved to San Diego as a child, Good's political 
involvement began when he served as administrative assistant to state Sen. Jim 
Mills (D-San Diego) in the early 1970s. He later served a two-year term as 
chairman of the San Diego County Democratic Party, ran unsuccessfully for 
county assessor and spent seven years as a top aide to county Supervisor Leon 
Williams, both at the county and during Williams' earlier tenure as a San Diego 
city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Good's career path also included periodic stints in journalism and publishing. 
A former reporter for the San Diego Daily Transcript and the San Diego 
Independent, Good founded the Uptown newspaper and published a newsletter 
dealing with local government and politics. 
</P>
<P>
A gubernatorial appointee to the California Structural Pest Control Board, 
which regulates the pest control industry, Good also served on the San Diego 
Urban League's board of directors, the city's Charter Review Commission and the 
county's Human Relations Commission, and was active with CASA, an AIDS live-in 
project. He also sponsored a proposed initiative calling for the addition of 
two seats to the City Council -- the same goal being sought in a lawsuit filed 
by the Chicano Federation now pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Happens to Be Gay' 
</P>
<P>
Only the second openly gay candidate to ever run for the San Diego City 
Council, Good often described himself during his 1987 campaign for the 8th 
District seat as "a candidate who happens to be gay, not a gay candidate." 
</P>
<P>
With other major candidates courting the gay vote, sexual preference never 
emerged as a central issue in the race. And, though some gays criticized Good 
for not being more overt on the issue, most saw his approach as both 
politically savvy and indicative of the role that he assigned his homosexuality 
in his life. 
</P>
<P>
"By being openly but not brazenly gay, I think Neil handled it just about 
right," said Rick Moore, head of public information at San Diego State 
University. "He treated it as a part of his background, just like any other 
part." 
</P>
<P>
After being heavily outspent by ultimate victor Bob Filner and lawyer Michael 
Aguirre, Good finished third in a nine-candidate primary, falling only 383 
votes short, out of more than 13,500 cast, to qualify for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Part of the System' 
</P>
<P>
That strong showing, combined with the accolades that Good received throughout 
the campaign for his articulate mastery of issues, generated immense pride 
within the gay community. Aguirre once noted that the other candidates hated to 
speak after Good at forums, "because there's nothing left to say but, 'I agree 
with Neil.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Things like Neil's campaign make gay people feel like they're a part of the 
system, even if the system doesn't want them so much," Moore said. "That's 
important, that's empowering, and that helps build self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Murray said he believes that Good's most lasting legacy will be the 
positive role model that he was for gays and non-gays alike. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil proved that you can be gay and still be successful and make a 
contribution to society," Murray said. "That's an important lesson for both the 
gay and straight communities, and Neil made a perfect example to hold out to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Symington, meanwhile, said that she will remember Good as someone who "refused 
to acknowledge hypocrisy or apathy on any level. Nothing about life was too 
sacred to laugh at or too common to care about." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake to view Neil's death as a loss just for the gay 
community," Moore added. "Because he really showed San Diego that the gay 
community has something to offer it. He was a person who made a difference for 
all of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Good's family plans a private burial. A public memorial service will be held at 
2 p.m. Sept. 10 at the First Unitarian Church, 4190 Front St. The family 
suggests that contributions be made to the Casa Foundation (Community Actively 
Supporting People with AIDS), 1015 Alameda Blvd., Coronado, 92118.

COUNTY'S JURIES UNKIND TO PLAINTIFFS, SURVEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plaintiff in any type of civil case stands less than a 50-50 chance of 
winning a favorable jury verdict in San Diego's county courts, a survey 
reveals. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are particularly low for medical malpractice cases, the survey 
indicates. That sort of suit against a doctor or hospital has only a 41% rate 
of success with San Diego juries, and even winning cases yield damage awards 
that average less than those from any of California's other big-city courts, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego lawyers said the results of the American Bar Foundation survey 
wouldn't surprise an attorney who has any familiarity with the local courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we know San Diego to be as far as all jury verdicts, not just 
medical malpractice," said Marc D. Adelman, president of the San Diego County 
Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, a study of medical malpractice cases, winning 
malpractice suits in San Diego courts produced a median verdict of $136,210. 
The average award in each of the other California counties in the survey was 
higher -- ranging from $5,592 to $124,608 more. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego "just has not evolved in the same way larger cities have, like Los 
Angeles or San Francisco or New York," said Virginia C. Nelson, president-elect 
of the San Diego County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego retains a community feel more typical of a smaller town, so jurors 
"may tend to be overly protective," particularly toward doctors, said Nelson, 
who specializes in medical malpractice suits. 
</P>
<P>
"People are conditioned to believe that whatever the doctor did is right," 
Nelson said. "You have to have a strong if not overwhelming case. And even 
then, they are lost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Rates Nationwide 
</P>
<P>
A low rate of success and a relatively modest award were typical not just in 
San Diego but nationwide, according to the survey. That finding indicates 
medical malpractice cases should not be included in sweeping claims about the 
jury system used to justify recent changes in the civil justice system, 
researcher Stephen Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I generally point to is that plaintiffs do not generally win medical 
malpractice cases," said Daniels, a research fellow at the foundation, an 
independent research institute affiliated with the American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking about jury cases in general, plaintiffs (nationwide) are 
more likely to win than not," Daniels said in a recent phone interview. "But 
not medical malpractice cases . . . and they don't win an inordinate amount of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels studied all cases that went to a jury from 1981 to 1985 in 46 counties 
in 11 states, a total of 24,625 verdicts. California counties in the study were 
Alameda, Fresno, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Most civil disputes, Daniels noted, settle outside of trial through 
negotiation. But jury verdicts help form the "context for negotiation and 
settlement" because they influence "whether and how much compensation insurance 
companies are likely to pay on similar claims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pain and Suffering 
</P>
<P>
Daniels chose the 1981-85 period to study because those years came "just before 
people were deciding there was a crisis" in tort litigation, a period that 
produced reforms such as California's Proposition 51. The 1986 "deep-pockets 
initiative" limited liability for non-economic damages -- "pain and suffering" 
-- according to proportion of fault. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24,625 jury verdicts, plaintiffs won 57%, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in medical malpractice cases, however, fared much worse. The 24,625 
cases included 1,886 malpractice cases, and plaintiffs won only 32.4% of those, 
Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the success rate for all cases was 48.8%, making it the only one 
of the six California counties where a plaintiff stood less than a 50% chance 
of winning when a case went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, San Diego was one of only three counties among the 46 in the survey to 
register a success rate for plaintiffs below 50%, Daniels said in the study. 
Most sites -- 29 of 46 -- had success rates between 55% and 65%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey Published in May 
</P>
<P>
In medical malpractice cases, the San Diego success rate dipped even lower, to 
41%, Daniels said in the study, first published in May in a lawyers' trade 
magazine called Trial. The study recorded 39 medical malpractice verdicts 
during the period in San Diego, 9.5% of the total verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The highest average award, measured among only those 24 sites with five or more 
successful malpractice cases, was $810,000. Honors went to Wyandotte County, 
Kan., in metropolitan Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
In the four California counties besides San Diego with five or more successful 
cases -- all but Fresno -- average awards ranged from $141,802 in Alameda 
County to $260,818 in Sacramento County. The $136,210 average in San Diego was 
below all four. 
</P>
<P>
A 1975 California law, designed to protect doctors and hospitals from 
malpractice suits by limiting damages for "pain and suffering" to $250,000, 
begins to explain why awards around the state are comparatively low, Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's "an uphill battle," Nelson said. "It's difficult to find against 
physicians. If you do, it's difficult to get a (sizable) verdict. If you do get 
(non-economic) damages, they get cut." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Size of Awards Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Why average awards in San Diego are even lower than the rest of the state, 
however, is an open question. 
</P>
<P>
"We always have enjoyed that sort of reputation in this area," said Dr. John 
Stevens, a San Diego allergist and chairman of a Medical Society risk 
management program. "I suppose it's a more conservative group of people in San 
Diego than in other parts of California." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stevens said, "We have for the most part well-trained physicians 
in San Diego, though I think that is true of other major metropolitan areas, 
too. But physicians are well-trained here." 
</P>
<P>
Unique to San Diego, however, is a large number of retired people, especially 
former military personnel, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got a lot of retired military people here, that may be a factor. 
A lot of retired people. There's a generation, I don't want to call it a gap, 
but there's a difference between an average lawyer and your average case and 
your average juror, who might be older than in some other county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Conventional Wisdom' 
</P>
<P>
Daniel T. Broderick III, a plaintiff's attorney who holds medical and law 
degrees, said Adelman's view was the "conventional wisdom, but I disagree with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Juries aren't packed with retired military personnel, he said, and those who do 
serve are "perfectly capable of being objective. Maybe their political views 
are conservative, but I don't think that translates into a defense verdict in 
medical malpractice cases." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego actually is known in the legal community for "better jurors," said 
Douglas R. Reynolds, a San Diego attorney who frequently defends doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think every lawyer that's seen a San Diego jury comments on their 
intelligence," Reynolds said. "We get a good cross-section, but the overall 
level of intelligence and experience is better than other big-city juries. That 
may make them more conservative. I think it makes them more able to reach a 
fair, reasonable verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, a former county bar president, said the trend in San Diego is simply 
part of a "national phenomenon. I'd be surprised if there were many 
jurisdictions where the percentage of wins by plaintiffs is greater than 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 counties with five or more successful malpractice verdicts, only 
one had a rate greater than 50%. In Bronx County, N.Y., the mark was 55.8%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Settling More Cases 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and hospitals are settling cases they suspect they could lose, 
Broderick said. "That's what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds confirmed that lawyers "probably settle a few of the more serious 
cases in San Diego that might get tried elsewhere. That's why you see $4 
million, $5 million verdicts in L.A., while in San Diego that same case might 
be settled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Never Get That Far 
</P>
<P>
Some medical malpractice cases that do go to trial, pushed there by lawyers who 
were "not very discriminating" in the cases they accepted, should never get 
that far, said David J. Danielsen, a San Diego attorney who often defends 
doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, there are "a lot of medical malpractice cases that get brought because 
there are too many doctors around," Danielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that they are bad doctors, but that (needing work) they act as expert 
witnesses," he said. "That's good enough to get cases started and to trial. But 
when these charlatans get to trial, they lose the cases. I think there are a 
lot of charlatan expert witnesses in this town or available to come into this 
town."

AL MARTINEZ: DOWN IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is never calm in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At any given moment, kamikaze activists are raising hell over a pot full of 
issues that include, but are not limited to, crime, sex, billboards, barking 
dogs and whether or not God favors a new church in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
I have attended neighborhood meetings more volatile than campus riots, in which 
all forms of human decency are suspended while otherwise amiable folks roll on 
the floor with their hands locked on each other's throats. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies whose normal mode of protest is limited to turning off the "Phil Donahue 
Show" in a fit of mannered pique end up swearing like stevedores over plans to 
close a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
It really doesn't matter who or what the enemy is, so long as it is chewable; 
sometimes they even eat each other when they are caught up in a feeding frenzy 
with no other adversary in sight. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is not currently the case on the western end of the Valley. If 
you look closely at the chubby guy splashing cheerfully amid a school of 
circling tiger sharks, you will notice it is Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Hal. He's the former Northridge T-shirt salesman who prides 
himself on being God's best friend on the L.A. City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Hal is the guy who tried to rid the Valley of moral filth by declaring war on 
topless bars (the topless bars won) and then suggested the way to clean up 
crime in a Northridge housing project was to move all the Mexicans out. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't worded exactly that way, but we all knew what he meant. Get rid of 
the Latinos and it's good-bye crime, hello happiness. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Bernson is not having a good summer. In July he was accused of 
violating campaign-funding laws, and in August he is the object of a recall 
move for allegedly conspiring with land developers to concrete the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation by Common Cause that the councilman spent campaign money where 
he shouldn't has passed with hardly a gasp of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
However, the charge that he sleeps with land developers could get him tossed 
out of office. Better he should have slept with his secretary than to cozy up 
to builders at a time when they are viewed with less warmth than a Jew in 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hapless Hal is the target of an organization called CURB (Citizens 
United to Recall Bernson), led by a lanky, slow-talking guy who is madder than 
hell and not going to take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Walter Prince and he owns a custodial business in the Valley, 
though at the moment his full-time job is trying to get rid of the man he 
believes is politically beholden to people who build things. 
</P>
<P>
It is Bernson, says Prince, who is responsible for wall-to-wall apartments in 
an area of Northridge once zoned for people with chickens and happy little 
children playing in large yards. 
</P>
<P>
It is Bernson, says Prince, who wants to tear down a Chatsworth hill where old 
people stroll to build a shopping center six times the size of the Northridge 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
And it is Bernson, says Prince, who wants to condemn 100 acres of land that 
include his custodial business and turn it over to land speculators. 
</P>
<P>
"That last thing did it," Prince drawled the other day in an upstairs office 
over a small garment factory where rows of ladies hunch over sewing machines. 
"I always knew he was being paid by land developers to do what they want, but 
this is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Prince, 53, says the recall idea came to him not in a dream but at a meeting. 
Bernson was being ripped apart in absentia when a man yelled, "Recall the 
s.o.b.!" Well, actually, he didn't use initials. 
</P>
<P>
"I went home," Prince says, "and said to myself, 'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
Now a small army of volunteers is gathering 18,000 signatures on petitions that 
urge bouncing Bernson into the twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to talk to the councilman about this but his press secretary, 
suggesting I am not a sweet person, said her boss would discuss urban growth 
but not the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic," Bernson Himself Said Wisely when he came on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic? 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't objecting to land development, they're objecting to the fact 
they can't get to work in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Ah-ha. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic," he said again, as wisely as the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Then he hinted darkly that there are forces afoot that exploit growth problems 
for political advancement. "Not everyone," he said, "is honest and legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Prince wants Bernson out for that very reason and has summoned other sharks to 
join the feast. Whether or not they will join remains to be seen, but the 
circle around the guy bobbing in the water does seem to be getting tighter by 
the minute.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of animal-rights activists is expected to demonstrate today in front of 
Sea World to protest the death of Kandu, a 14-year-old killer whale who bled to 
death after a confrontation with another whale. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Melvin, spokesman for an ad hoc group called Friends of Whales, said the 
protesters will sponsor an "educational picket line" so that the public "can 
understand what is going on" at Sea World. Melvin said he expects about 50 
protesters, who belong to animal rights groups, to picket from 10 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely that the close confinement they are in contributed to Kandu's 
death. . . . They're put in a glorified fish bowl. Orcas have a well-structured 
society, and when you take them out of that society and put them in another, 
everything is distorted. It's like you are living in a closet for the rest of 
your life," said Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials said that Kandu, who weighed 4,600 pounds, suffered fatal 
hemorrhaging in the nasal passages after colliding with Corky, a 7,000-pound 
female. The impact fractured Kandu's upper jaw and brought about the massive 
bleeding.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department received $625,205 Friday from federal authorities for 
help in cracking an illegal methamphetamine ring. 
</P>
<P>
The money represents the proceeds seized under federal law from the North 
County drug manufacturing activities of Richard and Ronald Mason and Jodie 
Jester, said U.S. Atty. William Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff joined FBI special agent-in-charge Thomas Hughes in presenting the 
check to Sheriff John Duffy at a news conference Friday. More than $3 million 
in assets were seized, including $1.6 million in cash, two businesses and about 
50 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy said his department's allotment will be used for 
drug-awareness programs in the schools. The department is awaiting from federal 
authorities an additional $19.6 million in seized assets, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's share represents the largest single allocation the department has yet 
to receive, Duffy said. Under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the 
Justice Department shares drug profits seized from traffickers with assisting 
local police agencies.

"I'm delighted to have this $650,000 to put into the pot," Duffy said.

Assistant U.S. Atty. Donald Clausen said the seizure law is "one of the finest 
weapons we can use."

"We completely destroy the capital of the organization," Clausen said.

The ring's undoing began in April, 1987, when two members were arrested by 
sheriff's deputies in Valley Center. That incident led to the arrest and 
indictment of 13 people, and also involved agents with the San Diego County 
Integrated Narcotics Task Force, FBI and the Internal Revenue Service.

Police arrested a San Diego man Friday in connection with the beating death a 
day earlier of a 57-year-old Clairemont man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. McAvin, 26, of the 7700 block of Stalmer Street was taken into 
custody at his home without incident, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. He 
was wanted in connection with the death Thursday of Archie Dean Rose outside a 
bar in Clairemont, Robinson said.

SUSPICIOUS INSURANCE LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) claims that he did not intend to hand the 
insurance industry a financial windfall last year when he wrote a last-minute 
amendment into state legislation. But that's been the effect of Bane's action, 
because auto insurers want to use his bill to charge California drivers even 
higher rates than they already do. 
</P>
<P>
Bane says his 1988 bill was actually designed to force auto insurance companies 
to rebate premiums to their customers if they made profits in excess of 5%. But 
the language of the bill is flawed. It states that the "Legislature has 
determined" that a reasonable rate of return for automobile insurance companies 
is "an after tax profit of 5% of earned premium." Anyone with minimal knowledge 
of the insurance business knows insurance companies don't make their profits on 
premiums. They make most of their money investing the premiums they collect, 
and Bane's bill made no mention of investment income. 
</P>
<P>
And the timing of the legislation is suspicious. It was rushed through the 
Legislature in its final days last August, when it was still uncertain whether 
or not voters would approve Proposition 103 and the other insurance-reform 
initiatives on last November's general election ballot. Those are not the best 
conditions under which to be deciding a complex and controversial issue like 
insurance reform. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Bane's intent, it is now clear that some insurers are thinking about 
exploiting this legal loophole unless the Legislature acts to stop them. At 
least one company, Allstate, has filed papers with the state Insurance 
Commissioner Roxanni Gillespie arguing that the Bane bill allows them to make 
profits of between 18% and 28% on automobile coverage. That attitude is not 
likely to sit well with California residents who already think auto insurance 
premiums are too high, and who are increasingly restive with Gillespie for 
enforcing Proposition 103 in ways that so far seem to favor the insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bane has introduced new legislation to clarify his 1988 measure, and it is 
pending before a state Senate committee chaired by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-North 
Hollywood). Bane, Robbins and everyone else in Sacramento had best clear up 
this mess before adjourning for 1989. If they don't, voters may decide to vent 
some of the wrath they feel towards the insurance industry against those 
members of the Legislature who cater to it.

ANGOLA'S TRUCE COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy fighting was reported in Angola last week between government troops and 
the rebel forces of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. What caused the collapse of a 
truce that was painstakingly stitched together in June by heads of neighboring 
African states is not precisely clear. But President Bush's refusal, in 
deference to his party's right wing, to stop sending $15 million to $18 million 
worth of arms a year to Savimbi certainly is a factor to be regretted. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Angolans have died in what now approaches a 30-year war, 
half of it fought to oust Portugal from its colony, the other half to drive out 
the self-proclaimed Marxists who snatched the government from the Portuguese 14 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The supply of American arms not only helps prolong the agony of Angola's 
people, it threatens still another agreement -- one brokered last year by the 
United States -- under which Cuba agreed to withdraw troops that were helping 
the Angola government fight off Savimbi. The withdrawal, already under way, was 
in response to South Africa's promise under the U.S.-sponsored agreement to 
relinquish control over Namibia on Angola's southern border. Cuba's President 
Fidel Castro said a day after reports of heavy fighting that it could lead to a 
halt or a slowdown in the withdrawal of Cubans from Angola. 
</P>
<P>
All of this follows not from any conflict between America's interests and those 
of Angola, but from a domestic political decision to oblige the President's 
right-wing supporters who see Angola's leadership as part of a Soviet threat in 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Angola's leaders themselves are beginning to back away from 
Marxism, as are other former followers of Moscow, and to grope for closer ties 
with the West. During all 14 years of the UNITA campaign against Angola, the 
country has continued to be a reliable supplier of oil to the West. Time has 
made it clear that Savimbi himself is as much outlaw as resistance hero. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been urged before to think carefully about the consequences of 
continued support for Savimbi, not just for Angola but for Namibia. With the 
truce falling apart and the prospect for more slaughter very real, the warnings 
about arms shipments no longer involve possible consequences. They are a matter 
of life and death. The President must act soon.

DON'T FORGET ARMS CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney jumped on Congress last week for rewriting 
the Pentagon budget and for treating it as a pork barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney then launched into what came across as an arms-race speech that was 
sharply out of place in an arms-control era in East-West relations. He implied 
that the House of Representatives has gone soft on communism and warned that 
the Soviets are beefing up their nuclear forces while the United States treads 
water. Members of the House, he said, seem to think that Moscow is no longer a 
threat and act like folks who would "give away their overcoats on the first 
sunny day in January." 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing for a defense secretary to go to bat for his budget and his 
programs, even if Pentagon planners still have not made a case that the most 
likely military threats over the next decade are those that would need B-2 
bombers and "Star Wars" defense systems rather than troops and weapons more 
useful for limited warfare. It is another to act as if nothing worth note has 
occurred in East-West relations in the past few years and that a nation that 
now admits that it cannot feed its own people is planning to add to an empire 
that is already too big to control. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Time magazine profile described President Bush's style as a cautious 
search for consensus, one phase of which can involve advisers with conflicting 
views fighting it out in his office. His staff calls such debates "engineered 
train wrecks." It is time to get up steam for a train wreck on how the defense 
budget and arms control fit together. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was not very specific about the Soviet threat, dealing generally with 
the specter of a "leaner, meaner" Soviet fighting force and specifically with 
very few programs, one of those American and the other Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
On "Star Wars," for example, he urged Congress to spend several billions of 
dollars on a missile-defense system about which the best he could say was that 
"we have good reason to believe we are talking about something that is not only 
realistic but that is operationally feasible within the relatively foreseeable 
future." That is not exactly the definitive sort of hook on which one hangs 
hard policy. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that, despite a handful of successful tests under what amount to 
laboratory conditions, the technology of "Star Wars" still is out of reach and 
may be for generations. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet system he mentioned is the SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile, 
the big missile in the Soviet arsenal, capable of carrying 10 or more warheads. 
Cheney correctly noted that the Soviets still are replacing older SS-18s with 
improved versions, scarcely a token of peaceable intentions. 
</P>
<P>
What he did not say is that the Soviets have agreed to destroy half their fleet 
of SS-18s, which would substantially reduce what most arms control specialists 
have considered the most menacing part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. The 
agreement came months ago during START talks in Geneva when negotiators settled 
on 1,600 as the maximum number of land-based missiles under the treaty. Since 
then the talks have been limping along, largely because Washington has 
formulated no long-range view of the weapons it would need to keep the peace 
after long-range nuclear missiles in both the United States and the Soviet 
Union have been cut about in half under the START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's view of the Soviet Union as a threat obviously is colored by his 
belief that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is bound to fail in his 
reform efforts, one that is not widely shared at the White House. But even if 
Cheney were right, it would be prudent to nail in place as many arms control 
agreements as possible while Gorbachev is still around to pledge Soviet 
compliance. It seems time for the President's staff to engineer another train 
wreck.

the ZLAC I, a 38-foot rowing barge, by the ZLAC Rowing Club. But then it had to 
be moved into the society's Balboa Park headquarters. Volunteer movers, above, 
struggle with the ungainly load on the park's Prado. At right, it is pulled, 
stern-first, through a double set of double doors. The eight-oared barge was 
launched Aug. 3, 1895, on San Diego Bay, accompanied by a 16-gun salute. The 
97-year-old ZLAC club (named for founders Zulette Lamb and Lena, Agnes and 
Caroline Polhamus) now has a clubhouse on Mission Bay. President Mary Grandell,

1985. BOB GRIESER

ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BROWN'S CHARTERED JET PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the sorry condition of public transportation is causing Brown a bit of 
trouble meeting his busy schedule and he proposes to resolve the problem by 
having the state lease an executive jet. 
</P>
<P>
Though we working stiffs might think it would make more sense for Brown and his 
colleagues to spend their energy and our resources doing something constructive 
about public transportation, we shouldn't be surprised if this fantasy comes to 
pass. And so a couple of suggestions to make the idea a little less 
unpalatable: 
</P>
<P>
At least 25% of the legislators' existing auto allowance should be deducted to 
support the plan. This might mean having to lease a Ford rather than a Lincoln, 
but most of us who elect the legislature have to scrimp a bit too, if we need a 
second car for work, and we have to deal with the tax code to get any sort of 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
All use of the plane should be paid at commercial rates, and since the chances 
range between slim and none that this would be a "no-frills" operation (can't 
serve the constituents without a shower, a hot meal, a wet bar and a fax 
machine, can we?), payment should be equivalent to first-class rates.

THE CARMELITE NUNS AT AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In answer to Deena Metzger's article, "Pilgrimage to Auschwitz," (Op-Ed, Aug. 
19), I cannot but see it as positively "un-Christian" to ignore Jewish feelings 
as to what is an appropriate memorial to the dead of Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
I personally might even agree that meditation and prayer by anyone at this site 
might somehow change the horror of this place. It might even transform negative 
vibrations into positives. Possibly peace could go forward from this place 
instead of evil and violence. I, too, have felt the need to meditate and pray 
at these same places. 
</P>
<P>
However, neither I nor Metzger have suffered at Auschwitz. How can anyone 
ignore the feelings and desires of those who have? When the relatives of those 
that were tortured and killed in Auschwitz want the Carmelite nuns at this 
site, I will add my vote to their right to be there. Until that day comes, I 
see the residence of this convent at this site as totally insensitive.

ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BROWN'S CHARTERED JET PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown should be denied his request for a chartered jet 
("Brown Wants State To Rent Jet for Use by Lawmakers," Part I, Aug. 17). 
Lawmakers must suffer the same delays and indignities that their constituents 
suffer at the airports and on the freeways of this state. They need to feel it 
in the seat of their pants, like we do. How else are they going to stay in 
touch with the needs of the electorate? How else are they going to represent us 
and help improve the quality of our lives? 
</P>
<P>
Leadership loses credibility when officials start "requiring" jets, limos and 
other luxuries in the name of busy schedules. You're one of us, Willie! You 
don't like airline congestion? Let us see you in there doing something about 
it!

THE CARMELITE NUNS AT AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metzger says, "It is uncommon to receive an invitation (such as she received) 
to the Auschwitz convent." I do not think, however, that there is any mystery 
about the reason for this invitation. The nuns obviously knew beforehand that 
she would write in support of their refusal to leave Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
That death camp is the burial ground of some 3 million murdered Jews. It is a 
symbol uniquely connected with the Jewish people. For the nuns to have 
converted the building where the Zyklon-B gas was stored into a convent is to 
have desecrated the sacredness of soil on which Jews were slaughtered by the 
millions. To have done this is an abomination, not to some but to all Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Metzger apparently did not see fit to mention the fact that in 
February, 1987, four European cardinals, with the approval of the Papacy, 
signed an agreement with a group of world Jewish leaders, in which they pledged 
that the convent would be removed from the grounds of Auschwitz no later than 
February, 1989. Nothing has been done, the nuns refuse to move, a Polish 
cardinal supports them, and the Pope has washed his hands of the whole affair. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger excuses this violation of a solemn agreement by saying that a convent 
located elsewhere "would not respond to the commonly felt need for a spiritual 
presence at the site of such horror." That is pure nonsense. What the nuns 
want, which Metzger supports, is to bury over time, by universalizing 
Auschwitz, the truth that this was the place where the Jewish people were 
enveloped by hell.

Despite the fact that the feelings of the (Southern California) residents upon 
whom malathion was recently sprayed ran the spectrum from not-thrilled to 
actively opposed, they were sprayed. A few thousand farmers get their way 
regardless of the feelings of millions of city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
There is another arena in which the balance of power is just as lopsided. 
Southern Californians, who consume approximately 17% of the Central Valley 
water shipped south, are metered and pay for every cubic foot. Central Valley 
farmers, who consume 83%, receive all the water they desire, unmetered. This 
year, a drought year, one can still drive through the orchards of the Central 
Valley and see farmers spraying their crops at midday, ignoring the simplest 
rules of water conservation. Why? Because it is slightly more costly to use 
conservation techniques. Farmers will argue that consumer would pay for water 
conservation through higher food bills. This is true. But it would be far 
cheaper in the long run for everyone if farmers had a financial incentive to 
use the existing techniques of water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
It's time we offered a trade to the farmers. We'll allow them to spray the 
cities for pests if they allow their water to be metered at a rate that will 
encourage water conservation.

At the city collection of toxic wastes on Saturday, Aug. 19, in Granada Hills . 
. . . I participated in a six-block-long line of bumper-to-bumper cars for at 
least one hour to deliver approximately 10 cans of old paint which had been 
stored in our garage for years. The 2,400 people who deposited the toxic wastes 
were only a drop in the bucket compared to the many people who must be storing 
similar materials. One pauses to wonder why there are not several permanent, 
well-advertised, easily accessible sites throughout Los Angeles where one can 
deposit wastes instead of storing them for a one-time date that may not be 
convenient for all. Such a system would encourage everyone to dispose of toxic 
wastes in an environmentally safe way.

Of course all Californians could voluntarily recycle glass, metal, paper and 
yard trimmings now. As consumers we are responsible for much of the problem, 
thus we must be part of the solution. But many citizens will never be motivated 
unless the state steps in.

OFFICIAL SAYS UNITS BILLED AS CONDOS MAY BE RENTED 
</P>

The developer of what was advertised as a luxury condominium complex under 
construction in Warner Center apparently can legally rent the units as 
apartments instead of selling them, a Los Angeles city building and safety 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Holquin, chief of structural plan check for the Building and Safety 
Department, said a preliminary examination of the 760-unit Summit project 
showed that the developer, G. H. Palmer, could alter the status of the 
development to apartment units, even though the complex had been approved as a 
condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
Holquin said a more detailed examination by the city would have to be completed 
before a definitive determination was made. "But on the face of it, it looks 
like there's nothing to keep him from turning them into apartments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision appeared to be a blow to homeowners in Woodland Hills who oppose 
changing the condominiums to apartments. They said renters would bring 
additional traffic and noise and would lower the area's property values. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus had asked city officials to examine the project, saying 
the change in status raised questions about whether its approval should be 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Picus questioned whether the developer had addressed traffic and parking 
impacts and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer executives announced two weeks ago that economics and an analysis of 
real estate conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units, 
even though they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer 
spokesmen said the firm never promised to sell the units.

UP FROM RUBBLE RISES TEST OF WILLS; 
</P>
<P>
MATTER OF PRINCIPLE PUTS MALL ON HOLD AT NOTORIOUS CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years it was the kind of crime-ridden bar where orders for illicit drugs 
sometimes outpaced orders for drinks. But on Friday the notorious bar, at the 
corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Bradley Avenue in Pacoima, came crashing down 
as a scoop loader cleared the site for a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the mall will rise on the site depends on a developer's quirky 
stand on what he regards as the financial nit-picking of the city bureaucracy, 
and what others say are simply routine requirements in the construction 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of the bulldozer-like loader dumping bricks and boards into a truck 
cheered some nearby residents who for years put up with drug dealing that, by 
some accounts, went on 24 hours a day. Dealers hired boys to hustle drugs out 
to waiting buyers idling their car engines on Bradley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you'd come here, you'd see action," developer Erez Kaminski said as 
the bulldozer attacked the mound of debris. "It's very hard to describe how it 
used to be." 
</P>
<P>
The bar was boarded up a year ago, but drug dealers and transients would break 
in and continue to do business, Kaminski said. 
</P>
<P>
"It made my business bad," said Jackie Fields, owner of the Touch &amp; Essence 
Beauty Salon and Boutique across the street. From her shop windows, Fields had 
watched the loiterers and drug dealers for five years. "They used to stand in 
front of my place too." 
</P>
<P>
The bar scared off customers, Fields said. But maybe now that the bar is gone, 
they'll start coming back, she said. A customer was also pleased to see the bar 
come down. "That's a good sign," she said with a nod. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene did not cheer Kaminski, who proudly announced plans for the 
mini-mall 18 months ago. Now Kaminski says he's not sure when -- or if -- he 
will begin building the two-story, 8,700-square-foot shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Kaminski said he refuses to comply with a city order to post a $10,000 bond to 
guarantee that he will replace the sidewalk after construction ends. Kaminski 
insisted that the bond is not necessary. The city should provide incentives for 
businessmen willing to build in high-risk areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The order to post the bond is insulting, he said. "It's like telling me, 'Hey, 
we don't want you to build it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kaminski insists that the issue is not money. He owns a check-cashing business 
a few blocks away on Van Nuys Boulevard, and he said he had the funds to post 
the bond. 
</P>
<P>
His architect, Uri Arbel, conceded that such bonds are a routine part of doing 
business with the city of Los Angeles. But Kaminski believes that the city 
should recognize efforts such as his mini-mall, Arbel said. "It's a personal 
principle for him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of principle, Kaminski said, he also refuses to pay $3,600 for 
permits to install a fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials familiar with Kaminski's case could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
When Kaminski's plans for a mini-mall were unveiled, they were endorsed by 
community leaders and state and local politicians. Kaminski agreed not to allow 
liquor sales. He also agreed not to install public telephones, often used by 
drug dealers to set up sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote a letter in support of his efforts, principally because he wanted to 
create an alcohol-free store," Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said. "We 
think it's a good project to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said he was not familiar with Kaminski's position on the bond. Katz said 
that as a state official, he could not speak for the city, but he noted that 
sometimes there is not much that can be done to cut through what a developer 
perceives as red tape. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage him, but there are rules that must be followed if you are 
going to build things in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaminski, meanwhile, said his plans are on hold. For now, he said, the site 
will remain a vacant lot surrounded by a chain-link fence.

WOO BLASTS PLANS FOR FORMER BOOKSTORE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo and some Sherman Oaks homeowners have 
been demanding for weeks to see what a developer plans to build on the site of 
the Scene of the Crime bookstore and the eclectic group of neighboring stores 
whose loss they mourn. 
</P>
<P>
They have finally found out. 
</P>
<P>
And they aren't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The developer unveiled plans for a $15-million, three-story, 85,000-square-foot 
retail and office complex with two levels of underground parking to replace the 
46-year-old row of stores on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Friday that the project is unacceptable, calling it too tall and "too 
sterile in a glassy-steely way" for Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he was unhappy with the developer, Jacky Gamiel of Jama 
Construction Corp. Woo said that the builder had not acted in good-faith toward 
his office or residents and that he would do his best to hold up the project 
until it is revised. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are any discretionary approvals needed, I will say no until we get a 
building that satisfies the community," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, an attorney for the developer, said he had tried to meet 
with community leaders but that they refused. He also said the project met all 
city codes and was compatible with the adjoining residential community. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're within the confines of very limited restrictions and the homeowners 
still oppose us, we've got to ask why," Reznik said. "They ought to communicate 
with us. We think it's a positive, attractive addition to the boulevard. We 
don't have a problem with them recommending an alternative design, but I'm sure 
a lot of people will like this one." 
</P>
<P>
Judy McCurdy of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said her group was still 
studying the plans and would schedule a meeting with Reznik in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer did build to the letter of the law, and he took into account 
nine of the concerns of homeowners," McCurdy said. "He's done nothing to 
mitigate traffic. He's built something he knows will be problematic for 
homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
The building, to be located in the 13600 block of Ventura Boulevard, would be 
pedestrian-oriented with a large courtyard, seating areas and fountains, Reznik 
said. Much of the building would be constructed of granite, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a quality project in a prestigious location," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said the complex would be designed so that traffic it generates would be 
concentrated on Ventura Boulevard. "The cars will go right into the project, 
and we will have so much parking that there will be no spillover into the 
residential neighborhoods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no tenants planned at this time," Reznik said. "The developer has 
not had time to solicit anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Gamiel evicted the bookstore and other tenants of the one-story storefronts 
this year. The remaining business -- Mary's Lamb restaurant -- is scheduled to 
close Sept. 3 and move to 10820 Ventura Blvd. in October. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has called for an environmental impact report on the project, saying it is 
an "out-of-scale development." Los Angeles officials are also withholding 
action on Gamiel's application for a permit to tear down the empty stores. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said the developer will sue the city if the demolition permit is not 
granted.

A CONFRONTATION RETOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue at an Encino school Aug. 17 was not a rough confrontation between two 
affluent communities, but whether the Santa Monica Mountains should be 
preserved for all people as a national recreation area or should be destroyed 
by roads, housing pads and county dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of easing congestion on Hayvenhurst Avenue, two Encino 
homeowners groups advocate extending Reseda Boulevard to Mulholland Drive and 
paving Mulholland. Developers and the city of Los Angeles support their view. 
The Friends of Caballero Canyon opposes it. Extending Reseda and paving 
Mulholland is a violation of state parks policy and the Mulholland Scenic 
Parkway Plan, which Councilman Marvin Braude says he supports. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino groups hired burly security guards to prevent anyone from Encino or 
Tarzana entering the public school who did not support building the road. The 
guards manhandled an elected official of the Sierra Club and a woman board 
member of Friends of Caballero Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Glushon, head of one Encino group, tore down signs that proclaimed support 
for the park. He tried to punch a UC student who was holding a sign. When he 
was in the process of breaking a banner that children had spent hours painting 
in our garage, my son tried to restrain him and was thrown to the ground and 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino groups called the police before the meeting and when they arrived 
late, they found a peaceful, but shocked, assembly of kids, retirees, hikers 
and citizens who had just witnessed the violent and effective repression of 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Braude entered this rigged affair with the developer's men. He was neither 
jostled nor pushed.

TWO VIEWS OF JUDGE MARGARET GRIGNON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The publicity and praise that Judge Margaret Grignon is receiving to me is most 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
I have had the personal experience of sitting in Judge Grignon's court for many 
days. Her "tough" approach to criminals is not so much for justice, but just 
plain lack of knowledge of criminal law. This was very obvious when the 
attorneys present and her own colleagues said "Your honor, you can't do that -- 
the law says, etc." Why Gov. George Deukmejian and Justice Armand Arabian of 
the state Court of Appeal are pushing her forward is beyond comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
She lacks the knowledge and experience for criminal court. That's why she sends 
everyone to jail because she doesn't know what else to do. Judge Grignon also 
experiences a convenient memory loss and has blatantly allowed a deputy D.A. to 
lie about certain facts in a case, then refused to hear testimony regarding the 
truth of the particular matter in the case. This omission of the truth and 
disallowing of testimony was very detrimental to the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
I say "thumbs down" on Judge Margaret Grignon and God help us all if she gets 
appointed to the state Court of Appeal.

PEETE GETS LITTLE SUPPORT IN 13-7 LOSS TO SEAHAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When former USC football player Rodney Peete came back to the West Coast Friday 
night, he returned as the quarterback of the Detroit Lions, who aren't a very 
good football team. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions couldn't keep the Seattle Seahawks from controlling the ball in the 
first half, when five penalties against the Detroit offensive line and four 
dropped passes interrupted Peete's offense on every possession. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, nobody in the packed crowd at the Kingdome could tell if Peete is 
or isn't quarterback with potential to be a winner in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
A game that a stumbling Seattle team led at the half, 6-0, was eventually won 
by the Seahawks, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
Peete completed five passes in 11 attempts for 39 yards in the first half and 
seven of 20 for 48 yards altogether before he left the game late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams scored later with reserves after identical interference penalties at 
the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rough day for all of us, " Peete said afterward. "There were some 
mistakes, some drops, and some bad throws." 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing I feel good about, was that everything was there for us. The new 
offense practices the run-and-shoot and got the receivers open. We just didn't 
execute." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very comfortable out there. I'm optimistic, I'm excited, about this 
offense. I was only sacked once, and I didn't get hit after passing any more 
often or any harder than in a conventional offense." 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we execute, we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
The essential problem for Detroit is that new Coach Wayne Fontes doesn't have 
many good football players. The Lions finished 28th on offense in the 28-team 
league last year. Friday night it was apparent immediately that they haven't 
yet improved enough to give Peete much support. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the Lions held possession for only five minutes, in which 
they could get off only 10 plays. 
</P>
<P>
They had only 12 plays in the second quarter, when Peete completed one of three 
attempts. Of his other attempts in that quarter, one was a throwaway and one 
was a 20-yard bullet off the hands of one of the 16 wide receivers still on the 
Detroit roster. 
</P>
<P>
Peete, at the start of the first quarter, had completed four of eight passes, 
but he couldn't move the team when wide receivers Stacey Mobley and Richard 
Johnson each dropped first-down passes, when Mobley dropped another, and when 
holding penalties wiped out other gains. 
</P>
<P>
Peete was throwing mostly catchable passes, but almost every strike failed to 
count as a result of holding penalties or drops -- twice, most conspicuously, 
with the Lions in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, with a rusher in his face, Peete lofted one for 14 yards 
to running back James Jones for what would have been a first down at the 
Seattle eight-yard line if it hadn't been eliminated by a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, rolling to his left, Peete threw a perfect pass 26 yards 
to wide receiver Keith McDonald at the Seattle seven-yard line, where McDonald 
committed his third, and costliest, drop in three consecutive tries. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, neither Peete nor the new Detroit offense could be evaluated with any 
accuracy. Playing minus a tight end in their novel four-wide receiver offense, 
the Lions could get receivers open in the Seattle secondary, they could get 
them the ball, often enough, but the big passes were rare, and never 
consistently held. 
</P>
<P>
A former Rose Bowl performer, Peete, whose long-ball strength is sometimes 
questioned, showed the required NFL power on mid-range passes that produced no 
yardage due to scrimmage-line penalties or downfield muffs. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lions can't find a few sure-handed receivers and linemen with the 
ability to block effectively without holding their opponents, the name, rank 
and skill of their quarterbacks won't matter.

DODGERS CAN'T STAND EARLY SUCCESS; PHILLIES WIN, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers, who labored 22 innings to score one run in Wednesday's 1-0 victory 
at Montreal, got two runs in the blink of an eye Friday night against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently satisfied with their quick run production, the Dodger offense took 
the rest of the night off as the Phillies won, 3-2, before 33,541 at Dodger 
Stadium in the opener of a nine-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who were 0-for-14 with runners in scoring position during the 
Montreal marathon, were 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position after the 
first inning and stranded nine runners Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez, who gave up only two earned runs, got off to a 
rocky start. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff man Len Dykstra belted Martinez's second pitch into the right-field 
corner for a triple. It appeared that Martinez had worked his way out of the 
jam after Tommy Herr hit a sharp line drive to second baseman Willie Randolph 
and struck out John Kruk. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez kept the inning alive when he hit first baseman Ricky Jordan in 
the left arm and Dwayne Murphy singled home Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mulholland, the Phillies' starter, didn't look much better than Martinez 
as he gave up two runs and three hits in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin singled to right on Mulholland's first pitch and scored on 
Eddie Murray's two-out single to left. Murray advanced to third when Jeff 
Hamilton followed with a double to right and Murray scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
But Mulholland settled down after the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
After being traded from the San Francisco Giants, Mulholland struggled with the 
Phillies and was sent to the bullpen. Since returning to the starting rotation, 
Mulholland had won his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry realizes now that he needs to use some off-speed pitches," Phillie 
Manager Nick Leyva said. "In the first inning, he didn't use them and they sat 
on his hard breaking balls and fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
"But he has done a super job his last two times out." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez got into trouble again in the fourth, giving up a leadoff single to 
Jordan and walks to Murphy and Darren Daulton to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jeltz drove in Jordan with a bloop single to left. After Martinez fell 
behind Mulholland 3-and-0, Mulholland drilled a broken bat grounder to third 
baseman Jeff Hamilton. Hamilton was unable to field the ball cleanly with his 
bare hand, with Murphy scoring to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez struck out Dykstra and got Herr hit back to the box to end the 
inning. Martinez was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who gave up seven hits and five walks in seven innings, said he had 
control problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to keep the ball down, but I hung some of my pitches," Martinez said. 
"I struggled with my fastball so I threw more sinkers, which are harder to 
control. I was throwing close pitches, but they just weren't strikes." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had a chance to tie the score in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher opened with a single to right. Billy Bean ran for Hatcher and 
was forced at second by Murray. Hamilton followed with a single to left to 
finish Mulholland, who was lifted for reliever Jeff Parrett. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda went to his bench, sending up Mike Scioscia to pinch 
hit for Dempsey. But Scioscia fouled out to third. Lasorda wasn't finished, 
though, sending up Lenny Harris to pinch hit for outfielder John Shelby. But 
Parrett struck out Harris to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I forced (Scioscia and Harris) to try to hit my breaking stuff," Parrett said. 
"I got the chance to be the closer tonight and it felt awfully good." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had another chance in the ninth when Mike Marshall lined a one-out 
pinch-hit single to center. 
</P>
<P>
But Parrett struck out Alfredo Griffin and induced Randolph to fly out to right 
to earn his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder John Shelby, sent down to Albuquerque on July 19, was recalled by 
the Dodgers Friday. To make room for Shelby, the Dodgers sent outfielder Mike 
Huff to Albuquerque. Huff hit .200 with one home run in 12 games with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>

Shelby, who was hitting .156 in 79 games with the Dodgers before he was sent to 
the minors, batted .286 in 32 games with Albuquerque. Ben Hines, Dodger hitting 
coach, thinks Shelby's hitting mechanics improved. "His swing looks shorter," 
Hines said. "And I'm sure John has worked at it." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said he was glad to return to the Dodgers. "It always feels good to be 
back," Shelby said. "I got a chance to work on things and straighten some 
things out (in Albuquerque) and I feel I got it straightened out. It was almost 
like starting over. I didn't make a lot of drastic changes, just a lot of 
little things." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said he worked hard in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it like I was down there on a vacation," Shelby said. "It was 
still work. I just took it day to day. When I was down there I never thought 
about getting called up." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby, who was booed during his slump, said he didn't care whether the fans 
booed him upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
"I can come here and hit .500 and they can still boo me," Shelby said. "If they 
boo me, I'll still be in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
After Shelby struck out looking in the first inning, there were scattered boos. 
But he changed them to cheers when he doubled to right in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger outfielder Chris Gwynn, who is on the disabled list with a sprained 
ligament in his right knee, was examined by Dr. Ralph Gambardella before the 
game and is scheduled to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging exam today.

CONTINUING POSTURE OF DENIAL PUTS ROSE IN DUBIOUS COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A press conference in Cincinnati on Aug. 24, 1989, resurrected haunting 
memories of a similar press conference on Aug. 9, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The central figures were fierce competitors and proud national heroes who had 
an arrogant belief that they were above the law. 
</P>
<P>
Each took his case to the court of public opinion, was scrutinized in daily 
trials in the media, and left an agonizing nation twisting in the wind when 
pathetic denials of wrongdoing became hopelessly unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
Each was the architect of his own destiny, creating evidence for a special 
prosecutor who sealed his fate: in one case tapes, in the other betting slips, 
checks and fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, each asserted his innocence to the bitter end, resulting in an 
inevitable, humiliating banishment from the one thing in life he truly loved. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Until Peter Edward Rose candidly admits his problem, a gambling 
addiction, and takes steps to deal with it, he won't earn public acceptance. 
Richard Nixon still hasn't.

STRANGE BEHAVIOR? FAN GOT WHAT HE DESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allen Brogan (Viewpoint, Aug. 19) obviously has no idea of the pressure 
involved in playing the last nine holes of a major golf championship. 
</P>
<P>
The spectator in the Curtis Strange incident deserved what he got. Before 
Strange approached his shot, he was distracted, and he asked the spectators to 
please be quiet and to show a little courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
This obviously didn't have any bearing and Strange reacted as any normal human 
being in that situation would. These incidents happen day in and day out on the 
PGA Tour, and I'm glad the public was able to witness it on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there shouldn't be talk about rest-of-the-year suspensions and 
Ryder Cup banishments. Brogan must follow baseball and football, where 
suspensions are a normality. Trust me, the commissioner of golf would not allow 
our sport to be lowered to that level.

LADY'S HAT LEAVES HIM BRIMMING WITH DISDAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Downey's article, "Giant Hat Gets a Fan Tossed Out," was very insensitive 
to the plight of the fan sitting behind the lady with the large hat. He paid 
for his seat, as did the lady. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, I sat behind a lady with a large hat at the Olympic 
Auditorium. I was not able to see the ring, and asked the lady to remove the 
hat. She would not because it would mess up her hair. I asked an usher to 
request that she remove the hat. He did, and she did. 
</P>
<P>
It is just good manners to be thoughtful of your fellow sports fan.

HIS FIELD OF DREAMS HAS FERNANDO ON MOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I first heard the voice as I was riding my bike through Griffith Park. It was a 
raspy whisper: 
</P>
<P>
 If you sign him, he will come. 
</P>
<P>
I looked into the parched chaparral. Nobody there. Maybe it was the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Los Feliz exit to the park, I heard it again, only louder: 
</P>
<P>
 If you sign him, he will come. 
</P>
<P>
Then I realized the voice wasn't coming from the park. I pedaled madly along 
Riverside Drive through Silver Lake and the Elysian Valley in pursuit of that 
raspy, disembodied whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 If you sign him, he will come. 
</P>
<P>
It was louder than ever. I looked up. The street sign said Stadium Way. 
</P>
<P>
Then it hit me. 
</P>
<P>
If you sign him, he will come means that if the Dodgers make a sincere effort 
to re-sign him, the great Fernando Valenzuela -- who hasn't really been seen 
around here since 1986 -- will come back to Chavez Ravine to pitch in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I realize that it'll cost Peter O'Malley a lot of money to sign 
Valenzuela, but at least he doesn't have to build him a ballpark.

Michael Brannan, a golf equipment salesman from Trumbull, Conn., beat two 
Walker Cup players Friday to advance to the quarterfinal round of the 89th U.S. 
Amateur Golf Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Brannan, a stocky 200-pounder, upset medalist winner Eoghan O'Connell of 
Ireland, 4 and 3, in the morning second round. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time Brigham Young player came back in the afternoon to oust David 
Eger, executive director of operations for the PGA tour, 3 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Brannan, 33, who said he plays twice a week, tried the PGA tour for six years 
(1978-83) and then reclaimed his amateur status in January. He listed a second 
in the 1979 Houston Open as his best pro finish. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Brannan in the round of eight was Jay Sigel, U.S. Walker Cup member and 
two-time national amateur champion (1982-83). 
</P>
<P>
Sigel, 45, of Berwyn, Pa., beat Mark Sollenberger, owner of a Scottsdale, 
Ariz., real estate company, 2 and 1 in the morning. He came back to eliminate 
Dave Brookreson, 41, of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., in a neighborhood 
confrontation, 3 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining three Southern California players all lost in the second round. 
Bob May of La Habra lost 1-up to Ted Himka of Seattle, Brent Geiberger of Santa 
Barbara was beaten by Jerry Courville of Norwalk, Conn., 5 and 3, while Jeff 
Manson of Long Beach fell to Danny Green of Jackson, Tenn., 3 and 2.

Larry Johnson scored 21 points and strong play by the reserves helped the U.S. 
basketball team defeat Poland, 128-75, Friday at the World University Games. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also had 13 rebounds as the United States finished the preliminary 
round of the 16-team tournament with a 3-0 record. Johnson, the top U.S. 
scorer, has averaged 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Mays and Victor Alexander, both coming off the bench, scored 19 and 16 
points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The United States will play Israel today in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, already eliminated from the quarterfinals, produced the first big upset 
of the tournament, beating the Soviet Union, 77-76. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the Soviets, who finished 2-1 in their group, advanced to the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The track and field events began Friday with the Soviet Union and China winning 
gold medals. Ken Flax, of Tiburon, Calif., won a bronze for the United States 
in the hammer throw with a toss of 248-11. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Astapkovich of the Soviet Union won with a meet-record throw of 264-4, and

NAVRATILOVA MIXES SERVE AND WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martina Navratilova failed to hold serve in five consecutive games but beat 
Nana Miyagi of Japan, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, Friday in the quarterfinals of the 
Canadian Women's Open in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeded second for the U.S. Open, failed to hold serve in four 
games in the second set and again in the first game of the final set. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to figure out a way to hold my serve," she said. "Otherwise, I was going 
to lose the match. So I had to mix it up." 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good player and if you don't play well, she'll give you fits," 
Navratilova said of Miyagi, a qualifier ranked 142nd, who had upset 
sixth-seeded Natali Zvereva and 12th-seeded Radka Zrubakova. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova will meet unseeded Australian Anne Minter. Minter, buoyed by the 
confidence instilled by her upset of third-seeded Chris Evert earlier in the 
week, helped her beat West German Sylvia Hanika, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In another match, French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the No. 4 
seeded player, beat 10th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-3, 6-2, and 
advanced to today's semifinals. She'll play No. 2 seeded Gabriela Sabatini of 
Argentina, who beat fifth-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has lost to Sabatini all seven times they have played, Sanchez is 
looking forward to the match. 
</P>
<P>
"She has topspin," Sanchez said. "Her game is good for me. It's not always easy 
with a player who plays topspin, but I'd rather play that than someone who 
always comes to the net." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Ivan Lendl defeated unseeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden, 6-2, 2-6, 
6-1, to reach the semifinals of the Hamlet Challenge Cup at Jericho, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 1, Lendl rallied after a spotty early performance to win the last 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
"I got careless in the second set. I thought I'd win easy, without having to 
hit hard," said the 29-year-old Lendl, the No. 1 seeded player for the U.S. 
Open, which begins Monday. "Svensson has the kind of game that can get you in 
trouble if you're not sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Svensson, an upset winner over Lendl at the French Open in 1988, used steady 
groundstrokes and drop shots to challenge Lendl. He appeared to have more than 
an even chance to pull off another upset until he double-faulted twice in the 
third game of the last set and again lost service in a 14-point fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
"Lendl is a solid player. He doesn't make many mistakes," Svensson said. "The 
way he played today, he's a favorite for the Open." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was joined in the semifinals by unseeded Mikael Pernfors of Sweden, who 
downed Robert Seguso of Boca Raton, Fla., 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the other matches, Jim Courier of Dade City, Fla., defeated fifth-seeded 
Aaron Krickstein, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, and sixth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of the 
Soviet Union eliminated unseeded Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 6-4, 6-2.

Michelangelo's David, are projected on the building. The march was part of a 
nationwide protest against Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-N.C.) proposed restrictions on 
the National Endowment for the Arts that, protesters charge, amount to 
censorship and content control. A second rally at the Federal Building, set for 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. today, is to include addresses by political leaders and

FACES . . .: BEIJING EPILOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loren Haynes says he became obsessed with the pro-democracy efforts in China 
when students took over Beijing's Tian An Men Square in May. In fact he had 
written a "very positive" song about the students' efforts and was getting 
ready to record it when the students were massacred June 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It just blew me away," Haynes, an actor and singer-songwriter, said of the 
massacre. "It made me very upset -- it hurt me because (the cause) had become a 
part of me." So Haynes instantly rewrote his song, "Beijing," and although he 
didn't yet have a record label, he recorded the song two days later at his own 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
The song talks poignantly of the students who died in Tian An Men Square, but 
true to Haynes' believe that the students' efforts produced lasting positive 
results, it ends on a positive note: 
</P>
<P>
Let the world know tonight in Beijing 
</P>
<P>
 It's the beginning of China's Freedom Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"(The song) shows the beauty of what happened and the shame of what happened, 
and that they did not die in vain," Haynes said. "I want to let the students 
know that we, in this country, are aware (of their efforts). To let them know 
that this thing is playing throughout the country and people are not forgetting 
about what happened. If (the song) gets out to just one person in China, then 
they could know it was not in vain." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, who has appeared in several TV shows, movies and stage productions, has 
received a good deal of media attention for "Beijing." It was immediately 
picked up and translated by the Chinese International Newspaper, he said, and 
has been receiving airplay at more than 50 college radio stations across the 
nation, as well as a few alternative radio stations. It has also been used as a 
backdrop for student demonstrations in cities such as Chicago, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, he says, the record has been smuggled into China. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone I know that lives in Shanghai and happened to be in the Square during 
the June 3rd massacre was here and offered to bring the song (into China)," 
said Haynes, who performs Monday at At My Place in Santa Monica. "So it is 
somewhere in China, and I hope they can find a big loudspeaker somewhere and 
play it." SHAUNA SNOW

THE HIGH PRICE OF MASTERING THE TICKET GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Sylvie Drake Aug. 17 article on telephone ticket sales, "Why You Can't Order 
Exact Seats by Phone," Ticketmaster chairman Fred Rosen seems worried that 
transaction times would be prolonged if customers were allowed to learn exactly 
what seats they were getting for their money. 
</P>
<P>
Question: When Ticketmaster phone clerks stretch out transaction times by 
trying to sell subscriptions to the Ticketmaster magazine, is that a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
If you answered yes, congratulations, you're a Ticket Master; if no, well, bad 
news -- you're a Ticket Slave, like me.

MASEKELA CONCERT IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Masekela, working for the first time Thursday night in the elegant Art 
Deco setting of Long Beach's Birdland West, looked around the room and decided 
to get things under way with an unusual warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of ripping into a blues or a rhythm tune to get the juices flowing, he 
took a few moments to share an invocation. With the rest of his band grooving 
softly in the background, the African trumpeter dedicated his set to a long, 
lovingly compiled list of influences that included the heroes of American and 
African jazz and pop. 
</P>
<P>
The invocation -- a perfect illustration of Masekela's remarkably varied 
musical roots -- clearly had a good effect. Once past a somewhat ragged opening 
piece, he sounded in fine fettle, his lyrical fluegelhorn lines cooking with 
energy, spirit and humor. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the works were identified as the compositions of African musicians, but 
their universality was self-evident. Hard-cooking funk is what it is, after 
all, and Masekela's program was peppered with large doses of body-shaking 
rhythms. Pieces like "Now Or Never" and "Lady-O" may have originated in Africa, 
but their zest and vigor required no translations. 
</P>
<P>
Masekela's vocals were an added treat. Far from being casual additions to his 
performance, they communicated passion and intensity that rivaled and sometimes 
surpassed his instrumental work. When his singing expressed, as it often did, 
deep feelings about South African freedom, the music moved beyond entertainment 
into the realm of powerful emotional commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The Masekela band was a well-integrated mixture of African and American 
musicians. Cape Town alto saxophonist Morris Goldberg successfully managed to 
negotiate the shadowy line between funk and fusion. Keyboardist Tony Cedras, 
also from Cape Town, ranged easily from gospel-styled piano to soaring 
synthesizer lines, while Nigerian percussionist Remi Kabaka and Americans Damon 
Duewhite on drums and Chulo on bass laid down a colorful and compelling flow of 
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Masekela continues at Birdland West through tonight. DON HECKMAN

REGINA BELLE AT AT MY PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a shame about Regina Belle. 
</P>
<P>
The R&amp;B singer, who appeared at At My Place Thursday night, doesn't have 
much good material. She's also caught up in pop trappings that are threatening 
to strangle her. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to sheer vocal skills -- range, power and the ability to convey 
feeling -- Belle has few peers in the genre. But on Thursday she was singing 
up-tempo songs with Bobby Brown-like arrangements, apparently to appeal to the 
kids. She was also singing ballads mired in pop excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Belle's hourlong show included maybe two or three songs worthy of her talents. 
With her pedestrian instrumental support, she was like a diamond in a setting 
studded with pebbles. She was accompanied by uninspired, plodding musicians who 
did nothing to enhance the material. Her backup singers were a help on a few 
songs, but most of the time they were just a distraction. Belle is quite 
capable of carrying a show vocally all by herself. 
</P>
<P>
Belle's focus is all wrong. She should be going in Anita Baker's direction, 
focusing on stirring, quality ballads. Her accompaniment should be spare -- 
that's all a superb singer like her really needs. DENNIS HUNT

MELNIKOV AS ALI IN KIROV 'CORSAIRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The role of the slave Ali in the Kirov Ballet production of "Le Corsaire" can 
be a scene-stealer. But the character was eclipsed by the titular hero and the 
heroine when a new Ali took over Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kiril Melnikov, 23, who succeeded Farukh Ruzimatov in the role, simply ignored 
the contradiction of a production that insists upon calling Ali a friend of the 
protagonist rather than his slave. Although Melnikov went through prescribed 
motions of submissive kneeling, he exhibited no trace of servility. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ruzimatov, Melnikov did not compensate for any presumed lowly status 
with brooding aloofness, heroic faithfulness or instinctive alertness to 
danger. At best, he looked like a kid brother, a follower, a coolish friend, a 
would-be aristocratic Robin to a decidedly noble Batman. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, he danced with rugged strength and a lack of finesse, though he 
partnered with reasonable security. Sturdy and muscular, he achieved decent 
elevation, maintained fairly clean shapes in the air and scarcely wandered in 
his final series of turns. 
</P>
<P>
He also proved blocky and sluggish, however, the tensile line and energy of his 
extensions clotted in the torso. He completed a circuit of barrel turns with 
evident effort, landed heavily and, overall, suffered from hitches in momentum 
and rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, he was no sulking, sultry, shrinking violet. Unlike his 
predecessor, Melnikov took his bows alongside the familiar Conrad (Evgeny Neff) 
and Medora (Tatiana Terekhova) at the end of the grand pas de trois. The crowd 
roared. CHRIS PASLES

STAGE WIRE: WITH 18 OPENINGS, BROADWAY PLANS FOR A BUSIER-THAN-USUAL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Broadway only offered 30 shows last season, a new low. The new season promises 
to be busier, at least until Christmas. Eighteen productions will have opened 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the season has already started, with "Mandy Patinkin in Concert," and 
a revival of "Shenandoah." Autumn activities will start Sept. 24 with Vanessa 
Redgrave in Peter Hall's revival of Tennessee Williams' "Orpheus Descending." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first of two productions from the new, transatlantic Peter Hall 
company. Hall will also restage his London version of "The Merchant of Venice" 
with Dustin Hoffman and an new, all-American company. (Nov. 23) 
</P>
<P>
Some other productions: 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Hotel," a musical version of Vicki Baum's novel that Civic Light Opera 
patrons saw in 1958 under the title of "At the Grand." The new version has been 
reworked, of course. Tommy Tune directs. (Oct. 29) 
</P>
<P>
"Threepenny Opera," retranslated by Michael Feingold, staged by John Dexter and 
starring Sting. (Nov. 2) 
</P>
<P>
"Meet Me in St. Louis," a redo of the old Judy Garland movie musical. (Nov. 2) 
</P>
<P>
"Secret Rapture," Joseph Papp's production of David Hare's play, a hit last 
season in London. (Nov. 6) 
</P>
<P>
"The Circle," a revival of Somerset Maugham's 1921 comedy with Rex Harrison, 
Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger "in his Broadway debut." (Nov. 11) 
</P>
<P>
"Gypsy," the Tyne Daly revival seen this summer at the Music Center and the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. (Nov. 16) 
</P>
<P>
And so on. As Variety notes, most of these are familiar titles and/or star 
packages -- almost a must these days on Broadway. But at least there's 
activity. Last year at this time, only six shows were set. 
</P>
<P>
JUST WONDERING: The new paperback edition of Jean-Claude Carriere and Peter 
Brook's "The Mahabharata" is emblazoned: "NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE." Has 
anyone ever admitted making a minor motion picture? 
</P>

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ailanthus altissima 
</P>
<P>
Tree of heaven 
</P>
<P>
Deciduous tree with large leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Ailanthus must be the only 50-foot weed in the world, and I have cursed it 
often as I tried, usually unsuccessfully, to remove it from various places in 
my yard where it decided to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day I went strolling through Echo Park and saw an entire hill of 
ailanthus, nicely shading a pretty wood house, gracefully fanning the air and 
looking downright regal. 
</P>
<P>
The mature leaves were huge, almost 2 feet long and divided into many leaflets, 
and the newer leaves were tipped with bronze. They made a lovely grove. This 
did not deter me in my struggle to remove ailanthus from my vegetable garden 
and flower beds, but it did change my attitude. Somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Ailanthus is highly prized in other parts of the world, especially its native 
China; immigrants to this country brought seeds with them, and aggressive 
ailanthus took root. Took over, in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
There seems little doubt that the eponymous plant in the book "A Tree Grows in 
Brooklyn" is an ailanthus; they are all over the East Coast as street trees, 
pushing up through cracks in concrete, lining turnpikes -- and shading yards. 
But the prettiest I've ever seen is in Ashland, Ore., near the entrance to 
Lithia Park. A spreading giant, planted nearly a century ago by a Chinese 
immigrant, it is one glorious weed. 
</P>
<P>
Ailanthus is not a big seller in nurseries; I guess they assume nobody really 
wants them. If you know someone who is trying to annihilate an ailanthus, ask 
for some seeds or dig up an infant plant. Just be sure, before you do, that you 
and your neighbors won't object to some serious weed pulling in the future. If 
you do find one poking up in an unwanted area, yank it out immediately, while 
it's still tiny. 
</P>
<P>
You can dig them, of course, but once past the 12-inch stage they have very 
deep roots. Or you can spray them with herbicides, but I don't recommend this; 
the herbicide tends to destroy the plants around it, while giving the ailanthus 
no more than a slight headache. 
</P>
<P>
When it is mature it is beautiful, because the seed pods that appear late in 
the year are very nice in dried-flower arrangements, and because it thrives -- 
proliferates -- without irrigation or clean air, in any kind of wretched soil.

STUDENTS STAGE BOLD PROTEST IN COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
OUTRAGED BY DRUG VIOLENCE, TENS OF THOUSANDS DEFY CARTELS, MARCH SILENTLY 
THROUGH CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defying Colombia's powerful and violent cocaine cartels, tens of thousands of 
students marched silently through central Bogota on Friday in a demonstration 
against drug killings and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The mass outpouring of students from a dozen universities illustrated a 
widespread feeling of outrage here over a wave of assassinations and a bold 
declaration of war by drug barons against the country's leadership. The 
government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas also has escalated its war 
against the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised address Friday night, Barco urged Colombians to close ranks in a 
"national crusade" against narcotics traffickers, "a crusade that undoubtedly 
will leave us with more blood, pain and suffering, but from which I am sure we 
will emerge victorious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bring Them to Justice' 
</P>
<P>
The president said the government's enforcement drive is breaking up networks 
of support for drug traffickers. "We will find the capos, and we will bring 
them to justice," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that the battle against cocaine trafficking cannot be won by 
Colombia alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Only with a concerted international action and only if the use of narcotics is 
reduced in consumer nations can we definitely win this war," Barco said. 
</P>
<P>
A hand-lettered banner carried by marchers Friday said, "All Against the 
Mafia." Another declared: "Colombia Does Not Fear Violent Minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Midday traffic stalled in Bogota, a city of 6 million people, as long 
processions of students converged downtown and then moved slowly along a 
freeway to the main cemetery. Some students wore black armbands, and others 
held red, yellow and green Colombian flags trimmed with black mourning stripes. 
</P>
<P>
A few carried large posters of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading candidate for 
the presidential elections next March, who was fatally shot Aug. 18 at an 
outdoor campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
"If You Have Consumed Drugs, You Killed Galan," one banner said. "Change Sides 
Now. This Is Our War." 
</P>
<P>
Galan, especially popular among young Colombians, was an outspoken opponent of 
drug traffickers. The cartels are being blamed for his death and for those of a 
high court judge and a police commander in the same week. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had issued a ruling against Pablo Escobar, top leader of the Medellin 
cartel, while the officer was commander of national police in Medellin, the 
city where the cartel is based. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo reported in today's editions that 
army troops raided a fortified house in remote mountains four hours north of 
Bogota that was the headquarters of Medellin cartel chief Gonzalo Rodriguez 
Gacha. 
</P>
<P>
In the raid Thursday, the army found an arsenal of automatic weapons, and a 
secret room containing documents that included accounting records of Rodriguez 
Gacha's cocaine dealings over the past seven years, El Tiempo said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said troops also found included lists of properties, front men 
listed as the properties' owners and records of Rodriguez Gacha's relationships 
with other cartel members. 
</P>
<P>
On a nearby hilltop, they found a communications center with powerful shortwave 
radios, the newspaper said. They also seized secret radio codes. 
</P>
<P>
Occupants of the house, called a "bunker" by military officials, at first 
resisted with gunfire but soon surrendered. Eight persons were arrested, 
including Rodriguez Gacha's son, Freddy Rodriguez Celades, 17, two of his 
nephews and five bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
In Bogota, student leader Oscar Eduardo Gomez said the purpose of Friday's mass 
demonstration was to reject intimidation of Colombian society by drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to destroy the country," Gomez, 20, said. "They are confronting 
the society. The good guys cannot let themselves be pushed around by the bad 
guys, and they are the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
In a show of support for "the good guys," the United States delivered two Bell 
212 helicopters Friday afternoon for use by Colombia's anti-narcotics police. 
</P>
<P>
"This action represents an immediate, tangible response of the U.S. government 
to President Barco's stepped-up war on the narcotics traffic," said a statement 
by the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. The helicopters were the latest of 17 provided 
by the United States in the past three years, an embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The same day that presidential candidate Galan was killed, Barco signed tough 
decrees providing for the seizure of properties owned by suspected drug 
traffickers and the extradition of traffickers wanted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, police and army troops have raided and seized hundreds of 
properties and detained thousands of persons. A few suspects are being held for 
extradition to the United States, but no one identified as a top-level leader 
has been captured. 
</P>
<P>
An organization calling itself "the Extraditables" and assumed to be associated 
with the cocaine kingpins issued a declaration of "total and absolute war" 
Thursday against "the government, the industrial and political oligarchy, 
journalists, judges and others." In an apparent show of force, terrorist bombs 
destroyed two political headquarters in Medellin and arsonists set fire to the 
nearby homes of two prominent politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Cali, where another major cocaine cartel is based, Judge Omar 
Garces told reporters that "the Extraditables" had sent letters to him and 
other judges threatening to kill 10 judges for every Colombian extradited to 
the United States. Cali judges staged a two-hour protest strike Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers have been blamed for the assassinations of about 50 Colombian 
judges during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Yair Klein, the retired army colonel who was identified in the 
Israel news media as an Israeli mercenary alleged to have trained a hit squad 
for the cartels, denied involvement with drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Israeli government television Friday, Klein, who had just 
returned from a trip to the United States, said he was training self-defense 
units for banana growers in Colombia. The units are meant to defend farms from 
encroachments by the M-19 guerrilla movement active in the country, he said.

EDUCATION DEPT., IN SHIFT, FAVORS BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Education Department, reversing its opposition to expanded bilingual 
education, is quietly shifting federal policy in favor of programs that use 
native languages to teach students English as well as other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very significant shift," said James Lyons, executive director of the 
National Assn. for Bilingual Education. The department's new posture contrasts 
sharply with the policies of former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who 
"tried to obliterate the native language skills of children," according to 
Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that one of the most important signs of change was Education 
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos' selection of Rita Esquivel, former assistant 
superintendent of California's Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, to 
head the department's bilingual education program. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cavazos and Esquivel, the department is "becoming more aware of the 
positive results that use of native language instruction can have on children 
in bilingual education," said Denise de la Rosa of the National Council of La 
Raza, a Latino lobbying organization. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the Education Department under Cavazos is "very radical, like 
night and day," said Shelly Spiegel-Coleman, a consultant to the Los Angeles 
County Department of Education and former president of the California Assn. of 
Bilingual Education. 
</P>
<P>
California schools have 742,559 students with limited English skills, most of 
whom speak Spanish, according to unpublished figures recently compiled by the 
state Department of Education. That represents a 14% jump over last year's 
figure, compared to normal annual increases of 6% to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
When he announced Esquivel's appointment at the May convention of the National 
Assn. of Bilingual Education, Cavazos voiced opposition to placing children 
with limited English skills into all-English classrooms. "The sink-or-swim days 
of learning English are over, and they must never be allowed to come back," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time that we are teaching our children English, we must do all we 
can to help them maintain their native language and culture," Cavazos told the 
educators. "Those are treasures which we should not waste." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Esquivel did not characterize the department's policies 
as having changed significantly since she assumed office on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has a Different Style 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose (of bilingual education) has always been the same, but 
probably my style is a little different," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal . . . is to travel throughout the country and to tell people that the 
primary goal of bilingual education is to teach children English, and that 
there are many ways of teaching children English," Esquivel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agenda is that we want to be very open and inclusive of everyone, and our 
agenda is that we will use the primary language where . . . possible . . . 
keeping in mind that it's only to build a bridge to learning English," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Education Secretary Bennett assailed bilingual education as ineffective 
and asked that more federal funds be directed toward programs that teach 
classes in English rather than students' native languages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds Cut Back 
</P>
<P>
"Bennett wanted to eliminate programs," De la Rosa said. "There was less 
funding of programs that were truly bilingual, and money was funneled into 
English-only programs." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, De la Rosa said she would not be certain that a policy shift had 
occurred until the department allocates more funds to grants for schools with 
bilingual education programs. The first budget prepared by Esquivel will not 
take effect until the 1991 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The department provides grants to school districts for three main types of 
education for children who do not speak English: transitional programs, in 
which students are taught math and other basic skills in their native languages 
while they are learning English; sheltered English programs, in which children 
are taught in English geared to their level of comprehension; and immersion 
programs, in which children are left to compete with their English-speaking 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilingual Programs Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Transitional bilingual education has been criticized by Los Angeles-based LEAD 
(Learning English Advocates Drive) and other English-first groups. They argue 
that students in bilingual programs rely too heavily on their native languages 
and do not learn English quickly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sandra Andersen, executive director of the California Assn. of 
Bilingual Education, said, "There's so much evidence for bilingual education 
and so many problems with immersion that we're really glad that Washington 
supports this view. We can get programs funded that we know will work." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Education Department does not favor one teaching method over 
another, Esquivel said. But she noted that she is "very much in favor of 
transitional bilingual education" and other programs, depending on the needs of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Local Control 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is that there has to be local control," she said. "The people of 
the community need to decide what is best for their school." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working as an administrator in the Santa Monica-Malibu school 
system, Esquivel has taught elementary and secondary school for nearly 30 years 
-- an experience she acknowledges affected her views on bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
"When I taught in schools where all the children spoke Spanish, a lot of them 
were not able to keep up, a lot got discouraged and dropped out. We used to

SUSPECT ADMITS KILLING NEWTON, POLICE REPORT

A man arrested Tuesday night during an unrelated traffic stop has admitted 
shooting Black Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton to death during an argument 
over cocaine, police said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Tyrone Robinson, 25, who has an extensive criminal record 
that includes a robbery conviction in 1985, killed Newton early Tuesday in an 
effort to advance his position in the Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics 
distribution gang. According to police, Newton had "crossed" the gang several 
times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, Police Sgt. Dan Mercado said, "wanted to be a high-mucky-muck." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a foot soldier, and he wanted to be a shot caller. He figured we 
already knew. We felt we had him and he knew it," Mercado said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Robinson told them that he shot Newton in self-defense when the 
two met by chance on the street. Robinson told detectives that Newton demanded 
free cocaine, and when Robinson refused, Newton threatened him with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
However, police questioned several aspects of the story, saying there was no 
evidence that Newton had a gun at the time of the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he and Newton had met earlier in the evening at a "crack" house 
where cocaine was being dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
Mercado told reporters that the gun believed used to shoot Newton -- a 
9-millimeter pistol -- has been recovered at the rear of a house "associated 
with Robinson." Ballistics tests are scheduled to see if, in fact, the gun was 
used in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and two other ex-convicts -- Mark White and Rodney Jackson -- were 
stopped in Oakland on suspicion of running a red light about 14 hours after the 
murder. The stop was made near where Newton died. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that after the stop, the three men "got cute" with the officers, 
who then discovered two guns in the vehicle. The three were booked on suspicion 
of being ex-convicts in possession of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Police Sgt. Mike Sitterud said Friday that there is "no indication at 
all" that White and Jackson, who were arraigned Friday on the gun-possession 
charges, were involved in Newton's death. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Robinson, an Oakland resident, admitted the killing prior to his 
scheduled arraignment Friday on the weapons charge, and the arraignment was 
postponed until Tuesday. As a result of his statement that he killed Newton, 
Robinson was rebooked Friday night on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Newton, 47, a leading and controversial figure in the Black Power movement of 
the 1960s, was shot in the head and left to die on an Oakland street corner 
near where he and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Views 
</P>
<P>
While some, such as his attorney, Charles Garry, said they saw him as a leader 
in the fight for "humanity, equality of the races (and) the dignity of black 
Americans," others, such as Alameda County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom 
Orloff, saw him simply as a criminal "who played no positive role in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Newton's encounters with the law began in 1964, when he was convicted of felony 
assault with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted in 1968 of the murder of an Oakland police officer during a 
bloody gun battle that erupted in 1967 during a routine traffic stop. The 
conviction was later overturned, and a second trial ended with a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of the 1974 murder of a prostitute, but the trial ended with a 
hung jury. Another 1974 charge involving the pistol-whipping of a tailor was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Newton was accused of embezzling $600,000 from a Panther-run 
elementary school. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to stealing $15,000 in 
state aid to the school and was sentenced to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
He had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days in San Quentin Prison for 
possessing drug paraphernalia, which was a violation of his parole in an 
earlier case. 
</P>
<P>
Several weapons charges over the years resulted in three convictions for which 
he served various amounts of jail time.

WOMAN TO FILL KEY JAPAN CABINET POST

<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu chose a woman Friday to replace a Cabinet 
minister who resigned in the second sex scandal of a disastrous year for the 
governing party. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Mayumi Moriyama, 61, as chief Cabinet secretary was seen as 
an attempt to limit the damage caused by Friday's resignation of Tokuo 
Yamashita from a government formed just 16 days earlier to cleanse the 
scandal-ridden image of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
She is the first woman to be chief Cabinet secretary, and it is the highest 
government post ever held by a woman in this male-dominated society. Moriyama 
was director of the Environmental Agency, also a Cabinet position. 
</P>
<P>
The chief secretary presides over twice-weekly Cabinet meetings, speaks for the 
government and coordinates policy discussions among ministries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acknowledged Affair 
</P>
<P>
Yamashita, 69, stepped down after acknowledging a three-year affair with a bar 
hostess nearly 45 years his junior. 
</P>
<P>
He became the sixth Cabinet member, including Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita 
and Sosuke Uno, to resign in less than a year because of an influence-peddling 
scandal, publicity over illicit sexual liaisons and an election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in the election loss last month, which cost the Liberal 
Democrats their majority in Parliament's upper house, was outrage by housewives 
at a 3% sales tax the party forced through Parliament last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Moriyama has experience as a housewife as well as a bureaucrat, and can 
see things from a consumer's standpoint," Kaifu said in announcing the 
appointment. "She will be able to include the people's perspective in policy 
discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, the popular woman leader of the newly vigorous Socialist Party, has 
been the main beneficiary of the public discontent with the governing party. 
The selection of Moriyama was seen as a way to counter Doi's impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elected to Parliament 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama, a former bureaucrat in the Labor Ministry, was elected to the upper 
house of Parliament in 1980. Kaifu chose her for the Environmental Agency, her 
first Cabinet post, when he formed his government earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Setsu Shiga, a man and former deputy to the chief Cabinet secretary, was named 
Friday to replace her in the environment post. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she expects problems, Moriyama told reporters, "I was just 
appointed and I can't really tell what it is going to be like. But as far as my 
nearly 40-year professional experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps 
from being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama was one of only two women in a class of 686 that graduated in 1950 
from the Law Department of prestigious Tokyo University, the training ground 
for Japanese politicians. She entered the Labor Ministry as one of its first 
female career officers in 1950, and was director general of its Women's and 
Young Workers' Bureau from 1974-80. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, she was elected to the House of Councilors from Tochigi prefecture, 
and in 1985 was appointed parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, when 
her exclusion from an all-male golf club became a minor cause celebre. 
Moriyama, whose official golf handicap is 26, was never admitted to the club. 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama has greater international skills than many Japanese politicians. She 
is fluent in English and served as head of the Japanese delegation to the U.N. 
World Conference on the Women's Decade in Nairobi in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
She has experience dealing in Japan-U.S. relations and other international 
problems as head of the party's Foreign Affairs Division and of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
Moriyama is the widow of Kinji Moriyama, a legislator and former transportation 
minister who died of a heart attack in 1987. She is said to have inherited some 
of his power base. She has two daughters.

U.S. GIVES UP HOPE OF A CAMBODIA ACCORD SOON 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration gave up hope Friday for a peaceful settlement in 
Cambodia soon, concluding that a monthlong international conference in Paris 
will be unable to paper over decades of animosity among the troubled nation's 
rival factions. 
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive settlement is not in sight," State Department spokesman 
Richard Boucher said. He said the sides are so far apart that Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III will not attend the conference's final sessions next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the 20-nation meeting to fashion a coalition government to rule 
Cambodia pending free elections apparently means that the Vietnamese-installed 
regime of Premier Hun Sen will remain in place even if Vietnam keeps its 
commitment to withdraw its occupation troops next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Officials' Fears 
</P>
<P>
Without a political settlement, U.S. officials fear, Cambodia could face a 
bloody civil war once the Vietnamese forces go home. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, which opened July 30, reached a nearly unanimous consensus by 
its second day on the necessity for a coalition uniting the two Communist and 
two non-Communist factions that have been competing for power. But it was 
unable to act on that agreement because the factions refused to make the 
compromises necessary for such a power-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher blamed the Hun Sen government and its patrons in Vietnam for causing 
the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who attended the opening sessions, advocated an interim government 
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former head of state and the 
leader of one of two non-Communist factions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition proposal endorsed by Baker, Sihanouk would share power with 
the other non-Communist faction, headed by former Prime Minister Son Sann, and 
the two Communist groupings, the Khmer Rouge and the Hun Sen regime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Solution 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials who participated in the conference, Baker was able 
to obtain a commitment from most of the other nations insisting on a 
comprehensive solution including an interim government, instead of settling for 
a partial agreement on verification of the Vietnamese withdrawal without 
establishing a new Cambodian regime. 
</P>
<P>
Most conference nations, including the Soviet Union and China, agreed that 
Sihanouk should head the coalition government, even though the rival Communist 
factions are both considered to be stronger militarily. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their shared Marxist ideology, the Hun Sen government and the Khmer 
Rouge are bitter enemies. The Khmer Rouge, under Pol Pot, caused the deaths of 
an estimated 1 million Cambodians through starvation, disease and murder when 
they ruled the country from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.N. Fact-Finding Team 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the diligent efforts of most of the participating countries, 
particularly the co-chairmen, France and Indonesia, some progress has been 
made," Boucher said. "There is a general consensus on the need for a 
comprehensive settlement." 
</P>
<P>
He said the conference has dispatched a U.N. fact-finding team to the region to 
gather information to prepare for establishment of a U.N.-sponsored 
international peacekeeping force in the event that other problems are solved. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of these achievements, there has been little progress in resolving 
the central issue in a viable settlement to the Cambodian conflict -- that is, 
the establishment of a transition Cambodian government led by Prince Sihanouk 
which would guide the country to genuine democratic elections," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Admirable Flexibility' 
</P>
<P>
"Prince Sihanouk has demonstrated admirable flexibility in attempting to 
resolve this key power-sharing problem," he continued. "Unfortunately, his 
reasonable attitude has not been reciprocated by Hanoi or the Phnom Penh 
regime." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the Administration's assessment of the work of the conference so far, 
Baker does not plan to return to Paris for the Aug. 28-30 ministerial session, 
Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department's Asia specialists are known to have urged Baker to attend 
the closing session. One senior official had said that Baker and his fellow 
foreign ministers might have the authority to overcome the impasse, while 
lower-ranking officials would not. But the secretary of state apparently 
concluded that the deadlock could not be broken.

'KILLING FIELDS' FIGURE FEARS NEW CIVIL WAR IN CAMBODIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The photographer whose story of survival in Cambodia was told in the film "The 
Killing Fields" said Friday that he fears that a new civil war is about to 
erupt in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Dith Pran, now a photographer with the New York Times in New York, talked with 
reporters in Bangkok after completing his first visit to Cambodia since he fled 
the country in 1979. Pran had been working with New York Times reporter Sydney 
Schanberg when they were caught up by the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Pran, along with Dr. Haing S. Ngor, the actor who played Pran in the film, 
visited camps in Thailand that provide shelter for Cambodian refugees. They 
were there as representatives of a human rights monitoring group called the 
Cambodia Documentation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pran said he was told by refugees at Site 2, the largest of the refugee camps, 
that opposition military commanders had told the refugees they are to be moved 
soon to camps in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After Vietnamese Withdrawal 
</P>
<P>
The shift reportedly will take place after the Vietnamese army completes its 
withdrawal from Cambodia, now scheduled for Sept. 26. The moves are being 
planned by both the Communist Khmer Rouge, who were ousted from power in 1979, 
and the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, which is 
nominally led by former Prime Minister Son Sann. 
</P>
<P>
"These are plans for civil war, plans for holding civilian Cambodian camp 
populations as hostages and pawns of war," Pran told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Pran called on the United Nations, which administers the camps, and Thai 
authorities to inform the more than 300,000 refugees in the country that 
discussions are taking place in Paris to arrange the voluntary repatriation of 
Cambodian refugees under international auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The monthlong talks on Cambodia's future have failed to produce any conclusive 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Pran grew emotional when he talked about the possibility of the Khmer Rouge, 
who have been held responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million 
Cambodians, returning to power in Phnom Penh under a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let the Killers Eat Leaves' 
</P>
<P>
"Let the Khmer Rouge killers stay in the jungle and eat leaves," he said. "They 
will grow weaker. If they come to the villages and cities and eat rice and 
bread they will only grow stronger." 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge is one of three factions in the resistance currently fighting 
the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government. One plan being discussed in Paris 
is the creation of a four-party interim government to rule the country until 
free elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh government has rejected any role for the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Cambodian people don't want them back in power, even to share 
power," Pran said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his assessment of the Hun Sen government's commitment to change, 
Pran replied that the government has implemented some reforms but that "there 
is still a long way to go." He said he had been told by villagers that people 
are still being tortured in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Pran acknowledged that he was barred from visiting refugee camps housing 
followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, apparently 
as a result of Pran's opposition in the United States to the provision of aid 
to the Cambodian resistance. 
</P>
<P>
While in Cambodia, Pran was reunited with his sister, his only blood relative 
to have survived. He said he also prayed at the graves of his mother and 
father. 
</P>
<P>
He said he found Phnom Penh to be bustling compared to the last time he saw it, 
after the Khmer Rouge ordered virtually the entire population to work in the 
fields. But he said the city has a long way to go to be again what it was in 
the 1960s.

FLIGHT OF E. GERMANS -- INTERNAL CRISIS MOUNTS

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stream of people fleeing East Germany, along with the underlying causes of 
the exodus, reflects a growing crisis in this hard-line Communist state, 
Western officials and diplomats agreed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has definitely reached a crisis," one Western envoy said. "There 
is a complete lack of trust between the government and the governed. Large 
numbers of East Germans want to escape, and the authorities don't know what to 
do about it. In almost any other country, there would have been serious street 
demonstrations by now." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the officials interviewed here said the crisis facing the nation is the 
most serious since a surge of citizens to the West in 1961 forced the Communist 
regime to erect the Berlin Wall and the fortified frontier between the rest of 
East Germany and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90,000 East Germans are expected to emigrate legally this year, 
and thousands more will escape by illegal means. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacationers Underscore Crisis 
</P>
<P>
The crisis is underscored by the great number of East Germans, on vacation in 
Hungary, who have tried to cross the border there into Austria and planning to 
move on to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans have seen and heard little of this in the controlled domestic news 
media. The rare reference has been to random acts of disloyal citizens. But 
East Germans can easily tune in to West German television, and on this they 
have seen film of their countrymen being welcomed in Austria and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The East German government, headed by Erich Honecker, seems to have been 
immobilized by the hemorrhage of its citizens. Honecker himself celebrated his 
77th birthday Friday in a sickbed in an undisclosed place after surgery last 
week for a gall bladder disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The current flight from East Germany began this summer when the annual flow of 
vacationers to Hungary coincided with a decision by the government in Budapest 
to dismantle most of the heavy fence along its frontier with Austria. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 have already succeeded in getting across into Austria, and an 
estimated 200,000 East Germans are still in Hungary on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offices Had to Shut Down 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans have sought refuge in West German diplomatic missions in East 
Berlin, Budapest and Prague, Czechoslovakia, forcing the Bonn government to 
close those offices until the situation can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the West German mission on Hanover Street is currently playing 
host to 116 East Germans ensconced on mattresses in a building within the 
diplomatic compound. According to a West German official, they are being fed 
and housed and advised to leave -- because they cannot be issued passports or 
other travel documents that would enable them to leave East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We are only a mission, not an embassy," a West German official there said. "We 
can't issue passports, but it would do them no good anyway since they can't 
leave the country without proper exit clearance from East German authorities." 
</P>
<P>
The official did not say so, but it is understood that in recent months many of 
the East Germans who have made it into the West German mission have been 
quietly moved on to West Germany -- with the help of Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans in the mission are for the most part young, in their 20s and 
30s, and many have children. They are fed up with the political and economic 
strictures of the Communist regime and the bleakness of their lives and shabby 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They See No Hope' 
</P>
<P>
"They are frustrated," the West German official here said. "They see nothing 
moving, no hope, and they want a more attractive life." 
</P>
<P>
Another Western official said, "East Germany is losing its best people, the 
young ones, and those with skills, professionals like doctors and teachers, but 
also carpenters and plumbers." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, analysts here say, is the fact that East Germany's 
Honecker has chosen to reject the reforms undertaken by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western diplomat said: "Everywhere, from Warsaw to Vladivostok, change 
is in the air, and the East Germans feel this. But the political leadership 
here doesn't understand it. They think that because they have achieved 
19th-Century dreams of full employment, housing and even cars for some, the 
people are happy." 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Heym, the most prominent novelist in East Germany, said Friday that he 
doubts that the rulers are capable of reform. He told a West German newspaper, 
"When I imagine what Marx and Engels would have said to a form of socialism 
from which people flee . . . with what scornful laughter they would have 
greeted this situation!" 
</P>
<P>
Most observers here say that even if the East German government were prepared 
to address the refugee problem, it would be hard put to come up with workable 
answers. If it should block travel to Hungary, it would only aggravate the 
people. If it should liberalize travel, it would risk losing even more people 
to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans, too, seem unable to help much. They are committed by the 
constitution to grant citizenship to all East Germans, and it would not be 
politically wise to close the doors to refugees, even though many West Germans 
object to penniless East Germans turning up to share in all the welfare 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of foreboding in East Germany today," one Western observer 
said. "Something's going to happen. I don't know what, but something's got to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
And, one diplomat said, "I think the regime hopes that when the vacation season 
is over next month, the Hungarian exit problem will be reduced. It will be 
interesting to see how many East Germans return from their holidays in 
Hungary."

REVERSION TO POLITICAL INTOLERANCE SEEN IN SEOUL'S INDICTMENT OF KIM 
</P>

<P>
Nearly a year after South Korea put on the Olympic Games and proudly displayed 
to the world its vibrant economy and fledgling democracy, the government 
appears to be turning the clock back to darker days of political intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
The country's most prominent opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, was indicted 
Friday for violating the National Security Act, a Draconian anti-Communist law 
that until a few months ago was ostensibly a target for revision under 
President Roh Tae Woo's program of democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ruling and opposition party members deliberating over how to improve 
the law considered abolishing the very clause under which Kim was indicted. It 
requires South Koreans to inform authorities of any pro-Communist activity that 
comes to their attention. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors accused Kim, 63, of violating the law by failing to inform on a 
National Assembly member of his Party for Peace and Democracy, Suh Kyong Won, 
who secretly visited North Korea last year -- and now stands accused of 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
If tried and convicted, Kim could face up to five years in prison on the 
national security charge, plus another 10 years on an additional count of 
breaking foreign exchange laws by failing to report $10,000 in North Korean 
currency he allegedly received from Suh. 
</P>
<P>
Suh could be threatened with the gallows, as Kim was when he was convicted in 
1980 on sedition charges, now accepted as fabricated, in connection with an 
uprising at Kwangju. Kim's death sentence was commuted under international 
pressure, and his civil rights were restored in time for him to challenge Roh 
and two opposition rivals in the 1987 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Now again on the criminal docket, Kim -- who was not arrested pending trial -- 
has vehemently denied receiving any money from Suh or having any knowledge of 
his trip to North Korea before it became public in June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Holes in the Case' 
</P>
<P>
"There are some disquieting elements in this, such as allegations that 
witnesses have been tortured," said a Western diplomat based in Seoul, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. "From all appearances, there are an awful 
lot of holes in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Suh, seven others have been arrested in the case, and four persons, 
including Kim and his party's floor leader, have been indicted but not been 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
Kim accuses the government of fabricating the charges to discredit his 
political party. Government officials contend that the prosecutors are acting 
independently and without political motives. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office in South Korea does not have a reputation for 
nonpartisanship, much as the court system had little integrity during several 
decades of military-backed dictatorship before Roh's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard-line faction in the (ruling) Democratic Justice Party seems to have 
determined it can use the Suh case to cripple Kim Dae Jung," the Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, on the other hand, has "declared war" against Roh and the government and 
vowed to fight the national security charges in court. He planned to organize a 
rally today near Inchon, west of Seoul, to protest the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"Mine is not an isolated case. . . . It shows the Roh government has abandoned 
the cause of democratization," Kim said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
"They have returned to the old era. . . . Even the ruling party is at the mercy 
of the security agencies now. Torture is popular again and the accused are 
denied legal counsel." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backtracking on Reforms 
</P>
<P>
Kim's indictment comes amid signs that the government is back-tracking on 
democratic reforms on several other fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Korean National Council of Churches reported last month that more than 
800 political prisoners are behind bars, despite a series of highly publicized 
amnesties since Roh became president in February, 1988. As many as 625 of these 
prisoners were arrested between Dec. 21, 1988, and the end of June, the council 
said. However, the totals include some suspects connected to violent incidents 
who might not be classified as prisoners of conscience in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freedom of the press has been dealt a chilling blow as the government 
suppresses attempts by ordinary citizens to communicate with or travel to North 
Korea. The editor of Hankyoreh, a progressive daily newspaper that was 
established after Roh lifted press restrictions last year, was arrested for 
planning -- but not carrying out -- a project to send a reporting team to 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The status of Chun Doo Hwan, the former authoritarian president and 
military strongman, has been in limbo since he made a dramatic retreat from the 
capital to a mountain temple last November. The opposition-dominated National 
Assembly has been unable to force him to emerge and testify about allegations 
of corruption during his eight years in power. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roh's bold and visionary "July 7 proclamation," a sweeping proposal he made 
last summer that was to reconcile more than four decades of hostility with the 
Communist north, has been all but forgotten in the shrill ideological crackdown 
on purported North Korean sympathizers, triggered by the secret visit of a 
dissident South Korean clergyman to Pyongyang in March. North-south talks that 
began in a spirit of bickering detente before last year's Olympics have been 
scrapped. Seoul has rejected overtures by Pyongyang to reopen the dialogue, 
saying the other side "lacks sincerity" because it has encouraged illegal 
visits by South Korean citizens naively attempting free-lance diplomacy to 
promote reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Roh renewed his conciliatory tone toward the north in a speech marking the Aug. 
15 anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, which led to the division 
of the peninsula between U.S. and Soviet spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day Im Su Kyong, a 20-year-old student who illegally visited 
Pyongyang to attend the World Festival of Youth, crossed back into the south by 
way of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone and was quickly arrested and swept 
away in a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
As conspicuous as all these events is the absence of the widespread social 
protest that toppled Chun and his repressive regime in 1987. The mood in the 
streets is conservative these days, as the country's "miracle" economy slows 
down to single-digit growth for the first time in several years and nagging 
uncertainty sets in about continued prosperity. The government would have it 
that South Koreans are fed up with the exhausting catharsis of confrontational 
politics, and seek stability.

BUSH SEES COLOMBIAN CRISIS AS BEST CHANCE TO STEM COCAINE TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, Times Washington Bureau Chief

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and his senior advisers consider the situation in Colombia "the 
best hope we've had" for stemming the tide of cocaine flowing to the United 
States from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a crisis precipitated by the most brazen kind of 
terrorist activity and not to really seize the opportunity to do something 
about it would be crazy," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, whether the $65-million emergency aid package Bush 
announced Friday -- essentially an accelerated version of what he already had 
planned to unveil in a long-scheduled drug speech on Sept. 5 -- will be enough 
to defeat the well-equipped and -financed international drug cartels based in 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
A host of factors, including the sensitivity of Latin American nations to U.S. 
intervention and the longstanding reluctance of the Pentagon to plunge into the 
war on drugs, have led the Administration to stop short of an all-out effort, 
in the view of some outside experts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Best Hope' 
</P>
<P>
And specialists both inside the government and out agree that the present 
"window of opportunity" may not remain open long. Expressing concern that 
Colombian leaders may waver in the face of the cartels' violent attacks, one 
senior Bush adviser said, "I hope they won't bend, because if they can sustain 
their current campaign against the cartels it's the best hope we've had" to 
bring the cocaine traffic under control. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence sources said that among leading political figures in Colombia 
there already has been talk that the government may eventually have to relax 
its crackdown and seek a negotiated compromise with the cartels if it cannot 
defeat them quickly and stop the wave of violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's aid package does represent a substantial increase from the 
current aid level of $29.6 million a year, which is itself almost twice as 
large as the $15 million in assistance Washington provided to Colombia the 
previous year. And the bulk of the new equipment in Bush's plan will be 
delivered quickly, beginning within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Ann B. Wrobleski, former assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters, said the equipment pledged by the Administration fills 
significant gaps in the arsenal available to the Colombian government to battle 
the cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Fairer' Fight 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombian security forces are among the best-equipped and best-led in 
Latin America to go up against the narcos, but they have been short on the kind 
of heavy equipment and the kind of firepower the President is giving them," she 
said. "It's got to make the fight a little fairer." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the aid package appears to stop short of the maximum effort 
the United States could make to underwrite an all-out assault on the cartels, 
especially an assault that struck all of their operations together. 
</P>
<P>
The military hardware the Administration will send to Colombia was drawn from a 
list of available equipment provided the White House on Thursday by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, reflecting its longstanding ambivalence about involving military 
forces in the anti-drug effort, pointedly made no recommendations about which 
parts of the hardware would make the most effective tools in the drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The first premise was that all of this stuff was going to be operated by 
indigenous forces," said a senior defense official, referring to the Colombian 
military. "We're helping. We're not going to do their work for them." 
</P>
<P>
An active-duty U.S. Army colonel, who served as a defense attache in Latin 
America in the early 1980s, said that the Joint Chiefs' approach to the 
Colombia crisis was marked by "half-measures that won't work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Unimaginative' 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to have a risk-free operation, but there's no such animal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And a recently retired Army specialist in counterterrorism and special 
operations called the Bush aid package "a very unimaginative approach." He 
suggested committing the Pentagon's most sophisticated intelligence-gathering 
gear, from AWACS surveillance planes to electronic eavesdroping ships, in order 
to have up-to-the-minute information on activities of the drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that a more effective response would almost certainly have to 
include U.S. forces in order to attack enough targets to cripple the drug 
barons. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas already has ruled out accepting the 
support of U.S. troops, which Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh recently said the 
Administration would consider if requested by Colombian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Barco, interviewed on ABC's "Prime Time Live" program Thursday night, said that 
Colombia needs more equipment to fight the cartels because more than 80% of the 
cocaine seized globally is taken in his country, and Colombia "is the most 
effective place to stop the supply of cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
On the same program, Ernesto Samper, who has replaced the assassinated Luis 
Carlos Galan as a leading Liberal Party presidential candidate, raised the 
possibility that Colombian authorities may consider negotiating with the 
cartels as an alternative to miliary confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Leeway Seen 
</P>
<P>
"We have only three months, no more than three months, to stop the 
traffickers," Samper said. "If we can, we must find another way." And 
negotiations, he said, is "one of the ways." 
</P>
<P>
But a senior U.S. intelligence official, pointing out that negotiations between 
Colombian authorities and the cartels in the past had been to no avail, said 
the United States must press Colombia to keep the pressure on the cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one democracy that is really trying to do something about the drug 
problem, and we can't let them down," he said. "And I don't think we will." 
</P>
<P>
One encouraging sign, said the official, is that the government's sweeping 
crackdown in the wake of Galan's death apparently took the cartels by complete 
surprise. He said that indicates that the cartels' influence in the government, 
generally secured through bribes and intimidation, had waned and that officials 
had been able to develop and implement a contingency plan of action against the 
cartels without their advance knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Privately and publicly, Administration officials have emphasized that they 
believe the crackdown Barco authorized is the most effective ever mounted 
against the cartels. 
</P>

story.

'VANISHED' DENVER POLICEMAN TURNS UP -- CONTRITE -- IN UTAH

A Denver police officer turned up in Utah after his mysterious disappearance 
prompted a weeklong manhunt, and he told investigators Friday that financial 
and personal problems compelled him to abandon his patrol car and head west on 
a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
David Hayhurst, 39, who had gotten a new apartment and a job at an auto-body 
shop in Reno, Nev., said he decided to return home after reading a newspaper 
account of the manhunt and deciding: "I couldn't do this to all those good 
people in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Took Off' 
</P>
<P>
"I just took off. I'm just sorry that I did it," he told KMGH-TV while en route 
to Denver, escorted by two police detectives. "I should have got some help 
somewhere. I didn't know where else to turn." 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst was in uniform when he phoned authorities and his family Thursday 
night from a convenience store in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Fitzpatrick and Lt. Tom Haney, who were sent to Utah to retrieve 
Hayhurst, said the officer was using the name Daniel Groves and was posing as 
an out-of-work auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst's abandoned patrol car was found in southwest Denver early Aug. 18, 
its motor running, lights on and driver's door open. Police at first feared 
that Hayhurst had been abducted, but investigators suspected he may have walked 
away on his own after they learned his Lakewood home was under foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst also was scheduled for a court appearance on charges that he had 
failed to make monthly payments on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Denver Police Chief Ari Zavaras said of Hayhurst: 
"He . . . said he was under such pressure that he just couldn't handle it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Zavaras said he has placed Hayhurst on paid administrative leave and ordered 
him to undergo psychological and physical examinations. He said Hayhurst could 
be reprimanded or fired after the tests. Hayhurst said he hoped to remain on 
the force.

DRUG VIOLATORS FACE RENT-SUBSIDY LOSS

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, fulfilling his spring pledge 
to act to remove people associated with drugs from government-supported 
housing, announced Friday that HUD will extend its drug-related eviction policy 
to affect recipients of low-income rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulation, public housing authorities will be directed to take 
action against tenants "involved in the felonious manufacture, sale, 
distribution or use of illegal drugs, or any other felonious criminal 
activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Kemp's earlier efforts to evict drug users and dealers from housing 
projects, the plan to revoke what are commonly known as Section 8 rent 
subsidies allows for tenants to receive a hearing on the proposed termination. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure differs also from the public housing eviction process by 
allowing "uninvolved family members" to remain in the subsidized unit where 
drug activity is alleged to have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"I am determined that federal taxpayers will not be required to subsidize the 
rent of drug dealers and users or violent criminals," Kemp said Friday. "The 
only housing subsidies for felons should be provided by local jails and state 
and federal prisons."

POSTAL SERVICE FACING ITS WORST DEFICIT EVER; 
</P>
<P>
BUT OPERATING HOURS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE CUT, 
POSTMASTER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Postal Service will suffer its worst deficit ever next year -- more 
than $1.5 billion -- but Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank plans no cutbacks 
in post office operating hours or delivery schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said he is confident that an ambitious cost-reduction program, heavily 
dependent on automation, can keep the postal system's finances under control 
until the next rate increase, expected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Operating hours at local post offices were reduced from March until September, 
1988, generating criticism in many communities. But Frank said that he will not 
approve similar measures this year or next despite the fiscal crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do that, absolutely not," Frank said in an interview this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Alter Deliveries 
</P>
<P>
Saturday service also is sacrosanct, according to the postmaster general. 
Reducing deliveries to five days a week "is not a possibility," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
"We handle 530 million pieces of mail a day," he said. "If we cut out Saturday, 
we would have to handle a billion on Monday, and we just couldn't do it. We 
couldn't deliver them, handle them and store them." 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service is in the final year of its traditional three-year rate 
cycle. It will apply next year to the independent Postal Rate Commission for an 
overall increase, probably between 15% and 20%. The commission, after lengthy 
hearings, will decide on the allocation of higher rates among different types 
of mail. New rates will take effect in the first quarter of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a first-class stamp, now 25 cents, would rise to 30 cents if the 
rate commission decides on a 20% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Losses are mounting as the Postal Service reaches the end of the three-year 
cycle because labor cost increases and inflation are exceeding the revenue 
increases produced by the last rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
The system should break even for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. But fiscal 
1990 will produce losses of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, the biggest deficit 
since the Postal Service became an independent agency in 1971. The largest 
previous loss was $802 million in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Frank's plans for controlling Postal Service costs is increased use 
of automation. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive automation plan "is more crucial to the Postal Service than 
anything else," Frank said. "We want to have a program that fully automates the 
mail stream." 
</P>
<P>
A vital element is the use of bar codes, the computerized horizontal stripes 
printed on some envelopes. They help reduce the number of people handling each 
piece of mail. 
</P>
<P>
Bar code information goes far beyond zip codes. For example, bar codes can 
direct a letter to a specific floor in a big building or to one side of a block 
on a residential street. That means fewer hours spent sorting and bundling 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of all letters carry bar codes now, up from 7% at the start of last 
year. Frank hopes to encourage businesses to increase the figure to 60% by the 
end of next year, and he will make a pitch for automation in his speech Monday 
to a conference of major mailers. 
</P>
<P>
The inducement will be financial. He said he hopes to raise the discount given 
to businesses that use bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
The postal service has just developed a machine able to read bar codes through 
the clear address windows on business envelopes. When the machines are in 
common use, businesses will be able to print bar codes on letters instead of 
placing them on envelopes, which is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Increased reliance on automation, combined with a $200-million reduction in 
spending by headquarters and elimination of 1,000 management jobs through the 
system by attrition, should enable the Postal Service to handle its budget 
crunch next year, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit for 1990 will be driven by cost-of-living increases and regular 
wage increases under labor contracts as well as by a surge in workmen's 
compensation claims. The cost of benefits for the Postal Service's 
800,000-member work force also is rising rapidly, with health insurance 
payments increasing at an unsustainable rate of 30% a year, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Total hours worked throughout the system will be reduced for 1990, with fewer 
part-time employees hired and less overtime for regular workers. In addition, 
some 8,000 jobs won't be filled as vacancies occur, Frank said. Normal 
attrition is 60,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Undertaking' 
</P>
<P>
"We will operate in the field with fewer hours next year than we did this 
year," Frank said. "That is a very difficult undertaking because our volume is 
going up." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the system must accommodate an additional 1.5 million to 1.8 million 
addresses of new homes and new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Various marketing innovations are being implemented, including the sale of 
stamps on an experimental basis through automated teller machines at banks in 
Seattle. The experiment will be tested at banks in Santa Ana later this year.

HEARINGS ON ASSIGNED-RISK POLICIES HALTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hearings into a proposed 112.3% average increase in auto insurance rates for 
more than a million drivers insured under California's assigned-risk plan were 
recessed Friday amid indications that any state Insurance Department decision 
on the matter will be put off until the social and economic implications of the 
increase are formally studied. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative Law Judge J. L. Whitfield suggested that representatives of the 
assigned-risk governing board confer with lawyers for a coalition of 15 
minority groups on the parameters and the financing of such a study, which 
could take several months. The coalition had intervened in the hearings to 
oppose an increase they said could "wreak havoc" among low-income 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield's decision to press for the study, meanwhile holding the hearing in 
abeyance, was hailed by John Gamboa, executive director of the Latino Issues 
Forum, one of the minority groups represented. "It is the first time anyone in 
authority has looked at the total implications of a rate increase," Gamboa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed increase would raise rates for the minimum state-required auto 
liability insurance to as high as $2,187 a year in Los Angeles and to an 
average $1,500 statewide. Opponents suggest this would force thousands of 
people to illegally drop their auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the assigned-risk system, insurance companies doing business in 
California are required to accept a quota of drivers who either cannot get 
insurance or choose not to buy regular coverage. Insurers said at the hearings 
earlier this week that the statewide deficit on assigned-risk coverage will 
amount to $600 million this year.

CO-DEFENDANT TO TESTIFY AGAINST ACTIVIST IN VOTE SIPHONING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A co-defendant in the case of Michael R. Goland, the pro-Israel activist 
accused of making illegal donations to siphon votes away from U.S. Sen. Alan 
Cranston's 1986 reelection opponent, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate 
with government prosecutors in a second trial of Goland. 
</P>
<P>
The first Goland prosecution ended in a mistrial July 10 when a federal court 
jury was unable to agree on a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. Atty. George Newhouse, the federal prosecutor in the case, said 
Friday that the co-defendant, Sandor E. Habalow, 45, of West Los Angeles, had 
agreed to plead guilty to one count of aiding and abetting Goland in making an 
illegal campaign contribution to a third party candidate to siphon votes away 
from Republican Rep. Ed Zschau in what turned out to be a very tight race. 
</P>
<P>
The third party candidate, Edward Vallen of the American Independent Party, 
eventually got more votes than the victory margin Cranston had over Zschau, 
thus conceivably tipping the election to Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse said, "Mr. Habalow has agreed to cooperate and we expect will testify 
in trial against Mr. Goland." The trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday but may 
be delayed by motions filed by Goland's attorneys seeking to stop it on grounds 
that it constitutes double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal prosecutor disclosed, the government has dropped all 
charges against another co-defendant in the case, Lyle R. Weisman, 31, of 
Beverly Hills.

COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTIONS IN 'GAY-BASHING' DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal, ruling in a widely watched "gay-bashing" case, on 
Friday overturned the second-degree murder convictions of three men accused of 
fatally attacking a San Francisco man because they believed that he was a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the panel reduced the convictions to involuntary 
manslaughter, ruling that the two bare-handed blows struck by the assailants in 
a 1984 sidewalk fracas were not sufficiently life-threatening to sustain a 
murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, John D. O'Connell, 42, died from head injuries suffered in a fall 
to the pavement after he was struck, according to medical evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprovoked Attack 
</P>
<P>
The panel, in an opinion by Appellate Justice William A. Newsom, conceded that 
the attack was unprovoked and seemingly motivated only by "mindless 
homophobia." 
</P>
<P>
"But the presence of such circumstances, however reprehensible they may be, 
cannot support an inference that the isolated act of striking a person with 
bare hands in itself imports a high degree of probability that death will 
ensue," Newsom said. "Malice (a necessary element for murder) can be implied 
only when the beating is so brutal that death is a probable consequence." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling appeared to open the way for the release from prison of three 
Vallejo youths who were charged and convicted in a case that inspired 
widespread public outcry and demands for added protection for San Francisco's 
large gay population. 
</P>
<P>
The three assailants -- Donny Clanton, now 23; Timothy White, 26, and David 
Rogers, 23; all of Vallejo -- were sent to prison for terms of 15 years to 
life. An attorney for White, noting that the term for involuntary manslaughter 
is two to four years, said she expected all three to be released soon unless 
the ruling is overturned by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hysterical Jury Verdict' 
</P>
<P>
"The appeal court said correctly that a slap and a punch do not make a murder," 
said Maureen R. Kallins, a San Francisco lawyer. "This was a classic example of 
a hysterical jury verdict . . . and a classic example of being tried by the 
press." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Blair Hoffman said prosecutors will confer soon to 
decide whether to ask for a rehearing before the panel or seek review by the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the three young men and other youths had met in a 
Vallejo parking lot on July 29, 1984, and then decided to go to San Francisco. 
A witness said later that he heard Rogers urge the group to attack homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
At about 9 p.m., the group encountered O'Connell, a gay activist, and another 
man on Polk Street, a well-known congregating area for homosexuals, and an 
altercation ensued. Witnesses said O'Connell was struck twice in the face and 
fell back on the sidewalk. He was taken to the hospital, where a blood sample 
revealed he was highly intoxicated with blood alcohol level of 0.29%. O'Connell 
went into a coma and died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Newsom's majority opinion was joined by Appellate Justice John T. Racanelli. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Appellate Justice John W. Holmdahl agreed that a bare-fisted attack 
resulting in death was usually not considered murder -- but said there were 
sufficient "aggravating circumstances" to elevate this crime from one of 
manslaughter.

A Soviet space cargo craft docked successfully with the orbiting station Mir 
Friday to supply scientific equipment for a manned mission next month, Tass 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency said the unmanned Progress-M craft, a new type of space 
vehicle, docked with Mir at 9:19 a.m. Moscow time. Two Soviet cosmonauts are 
due to lift off for Mir Sept. 6 for a five-month stay on the space station. 
</P>
<P>
Mir has been unmanned since April, following criticism of the cost of the 
Soviet space program at a time of severe economic problems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has allocated the equivalent of more than $10 billion for its 
space program this year, including $6 billion for military projects, the 
newspaper Argumenty I Fakty reported Friday.

U.S. FAILS TO GET REVIEW OF ORDER FOR NEW SPY TRIAL FOR EX-FBI AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government's bid for a rehearing on a decision to grant a new trial 
for Richard W. Miller, an FBI agent whose love affair with a Soviet spy landed 
him in federal prison for two life terms, was denied Friday by the U.S. 9th 
Circuit of Appeals. The decision means that the matter will likely be appealed 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Judge Dorothy W. Nelson was joined by Judges Stephen Reinhardt and 
Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain in unanimously rejecting the government's request. The 
same panel ruled earlier this year that Miller should be granted a new trial 
because jurors were allowed to hear too many details about lie detector tests 
that Miller failed. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion issued Friday, the judges reviewed several government arguments 
concerning the polygraph issue and rejected all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the judges said: "The full court (27 judges) has been advised of 
the (government's) suggestion of a rehearing en banc (a panel of 11 judges), 
and no judge of the court has requested a vote on the suggestion for rehearing 
en banc." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Move 
</P>
<P>
This means that the next move for the government would be to file a petition 
with the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Miller's defense lawyers said 
they expect the government to seek a Supreme Court review, but there was no 
immediate comment from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the decision," said Joel Levine, one of Miller's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 52, was convicted by a Los Angeles federal jury in June, 1986, of 
passing FBI secrets to the Soviet KGB during an adulterous affair with Soviet 
emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova. The agent, Ogorodnikova and her husband all are 
serving federal prison sentences. Miller is in a medium-security facility in 
Rochester, Minn. In mid-July, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who presided 
over his trial, denied him release on bail pending a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's attorney, asked about rumors that plea negotiations were under way 
between the former agent and the government, said that "anything's possible," 
but he expressed doubt that a bargain could be struck. The government, he said, 
is committed to the case "emotionally and politically." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has expended enormous resources prosecuting Miller. He had a 
three-month trial in 1985, which ended in mistrial when jurors deadlocked after 
three weeks of deliberations. His second trial lasted four months. He has now 
served nearly five years of what was originally a sentence of two life terms 
plus 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Blow 
</P>
<P>
The April overturning of his conviction was a significant blow to the 
government. It constituted the first reversal of a major espionage conviction 
in a series of more than five dozen prosecutions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, an excommunicated Mormon and father of eight, had frequent problems as 
an FBI agent. He asserted that his relationship with Ogorodnikova and her 
husband was an attempt to become a secret double agent by penetrating a KGB spy 
ring. But prosecutors contended that he agreed to pass a confidential U.S. 
intelligence assessment to Ogorodnikova in exchange for sex, $15,000 in cash, 
$50,000 in gold and a $675 Burberry trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
Ogorodnikova and her husband pleaded guilty to espionage charges. She was 
sentenced to 18 years in prison after admitting that Miller gave her a 
confidential intelligence document. But at his trial, she reversed herself, 
declaring that Miller "is not a traitor to his country" and denying that she 
got any documents from her former paramour. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors produced evidence at the trial that Miller, during five days of 
intense interrogation by his FBI superiors, failed several polygraph tests. 
After he was informed of the results and demanded to speak with another 
polygraph examiner, Miller made several damaging admissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lie Detector 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not attempt to introduce the test results until Miller's 
lawyers challenged the reliability of the admissions, contending that they were 
the products of a distraught, tired man who had been pressured by his 
interrogators. In response, government lawyers contended that it was necessary 
to introduce the lie detector tests to show the sequence of events in which 
Miller ultimately made the admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Polygraph tests are rarely admissible in federal trials. The appeals court said 
the value of the testimony in this case, which was introduced for limited 
purposes, was "slight indeed," compared to "the overwhelming potential 
prejudice."

OLDIES BRIGHTEN JACKSON BROWNE'S DARK MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singing an updated rendition of the old blues song "Cocaine" at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, accompanied by his pal David Lindley on violin, Jackson Browne 
recently brought along a few new verses to fit his coke-free, 
consciousness-raised life style: 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have been a user even one more day/If you'd shown me how I was 
helping turn a profit for the CIA," went one couplet. And: "Look at me, I'm as 
sharp as a tack/Except for a few million brain cells I wouldn't mind having 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but Browne's memory is still in dandy shape. At one point he good-humoredly 
brought up a review that suggested one of his Central American-themed 
compositions sounded "more like a speech than a song." This was a review that 
ran in The Times nearly three years ago to the day, mind you. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening 36 months, Browne's new material has only gotten more, not 
less, pedantic. Which doesn't mean that it's never effective. That's been three 
more years to get used to the idea of his shift from a confessional style to a 
sharply oratorical one -- and, more significantly, three years of disturbing 
congressional hearings to make his protest songs seem less paranoid and more 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
Still, fans cheered the pre-social conscience oldies loudest, which is 
understandable; seven nifty numbers on which opening act and longtime cohort 
Lindley guested were reminders of just how listless much of Browne's 
Lindley-less arrangements have become.

<P>
Sheena Easton's show at the Universal Amphitheatre last weekend was an 
hour-plus, high-energy workout of every song she's ever recorded -- or maybe it 
just seemed that way. 
</P>
<P>
Easton, who'll be at the Pacific Amphitheatre tonight, is a gifted singer with 
industrial-strength lungs and charm to spare. Still, her act contains a lot of 
bloat. 
</P>
<P>
While Easton can outclass many other pop vocalists on such emotive, 
lung-bursting ballads as "I Wouldn't Beg for Water" and "For Your Eyes Only," 
she wasted a lot of time on lightweight sweat-inducers like "No Deposit, No 
Return." 
</P>
<P>
She sounded best when she stuck to fresher fare, such as "Sugar Walls," a song 
that earned her Tipper Gore's brand as a corrupter of youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Dan Quayle's more dangerous to this country than I am," Easton chortled 
Friday. And he probably doesn't look nearly as cute in exercise gear. CONNIE 
JOHNSON Sheena Easton sings tonight at 7:30 at the Pacific Amphitheatre, 100

A Los Angeles police officer was absolved Friday of four departmental charges 
stemming from a massive drug raid last summer that left apartments in two 
buildings west of the Coliseum virtually uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Carl A. Sims Jr., however, was given a two-day suspension after he was 
found guilty by an Police Department tribunal of making false and misleading 
statements in an affidavit that was used to obtain a search warrant for the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Sims, a seven-year LAPD veteran who now works as a detective trainee, was among 
88 officers who took part in the August, 1988, raid on Dalton Avenue near 39th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 38 of the officers were cited by the LAPD for misconduct and, of 
those, nine were ordered to appear before department tribunals made up of three 
command-level officers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the departmental citations, criminal charges are pending against 
four officers, including a former division commander who before the raid 
allegedly told the officers to render the apartments "uninhabitable." 
</P>
<P>
Sims' was the first of the nine tribunals to be held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acquitted on 4 Charges 
</P>
<P>
After hearing three weeks of testimony, the tribunal acquitted Sims of making a 
false arrest, filing a false arrest report, improperly disposing of evidence 
and failing to note in court records the existence of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
But the tribunal, in a unanimous decision, found that Sims had submitted an 
affidavit falsely stating that there had been three formal complaints of 
narcotics and other criminal activity outside the targeted apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
He also misrepresented the expertise of an undercover officer involved in 
surveillance of the apartments and the affidavit falsely asserted that one of 
the undercover officers had purchased rock cocaine at the location on 
"numerous" occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. William Gartland, the tribunal chairman, told Sims before giving him the 
two days off without pay that the inaccuracies in the affidavit were of "a 
minor nature," but that Sims had to be "reminded of the need for your work to 
be factual and verifiable." 
</P>
<P>
Gartland, in explaining the penalty, cited testimony of Municipal Judge 
Glenette Blackwell, who said she would have signed the warrant even if the 
inaccuracies had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Monrow Mabon, an LAPD officer who acted as prosecutor during the 
proceeding, characterized the search warrant affidavit as riddled with 
"outright lies." 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, Mabon had contended that Sims also lied in the affidavit 
about his own qualifications as a narcotics expert, the assignment he was 
working on and the number of previous arrests he had made in the area of 39th 
Street and Dalton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The tribunal did not rule on those assertions by Mabon. 
</P>
<P>
One local civil rights activist said the relatively light penalty sends a 
message to police officers that they will not be held accountable for improper 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trivializes the Offense' 
</P>
<P>
"Such a ruling trivializes the offense and the process," said Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Sims said he thought he had been treated fairly and that 
"justice has been served." 
</P>
<P>
The raid from which the charges against Sims stemmed occurred the evening of 
Aug. 1, 1988, and was considered a major part of the Police Department's 
anti-gang effort. 
</P>
<P>
According to the search warrant, the officers conducting the raid were looking 
for rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Residents later said that the 88 officers seemed only intent upon destroying 
the four apartments and taking into custody as many people as they could find. 
Some of the residents contended that the officers were looking for someone who 
allegedly had called the Southwest Division a few days earlier and threatened 
to kill a police officer.

LAKE HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTS BATTLE TO PRESERVE LIFE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who have long enjoyed the glimmering lights of Los Angeles from their 
expensive hillside homes above the Hollywood Reservoir expressed fears Friday 
that urban problems are intruding on their rustic life styles. 
</P>
<P>
First, cross-town traffic began streaming along their winding roads after a 
novelty book depicting the best shortcuts through Los Angeles went on sale at 
local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Another Laurel Canyon' 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be like another Laurel Canyon around here," grumbled resident 
James Goode, who lives directly beneath the famed Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
Then, neighbors found that their pristine hillsides were attracting dumping. 
</P>
<P>
"There are couches being dumped in our neighborhood," complained Dan Riffe, 
president of the Lake Hollywood Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a Los Angeles developer backed by $10-million from private Japanese 
investors has decided to bulldoze his way up their hill and build luxury homes 
on the largest and last remaining open canyon area in their hillside enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Thomas P. Sullivan plans to construct 64 hilltop mansions on 164 
acres north of the Hollywood Reservoir, also known as Lake Hollywood. It is an 
area where the reservoir's blue fingers reach into brush and tree-covered 
canyons crossed by dirt paths that have long been a favorite site for joggers 
and bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
Early plans show custom-built Mediterranean-style mansions, beginning at 4,000 
square feet of floor space, will sell for between $2.5 million and $3 million. 
Construction is not expected to begin for another year. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have the best views in the city," said Sullivan, president 
of Jefferson Development Corp. "It's going to be Bel-Air East." 
</P>
<P>
But because so many palm trees will be planted along the hillsides, the 
developer said it would be better known as "Palm-Air." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Sullivan on Thursday night, about 40 residents who are 
fiercely protective of their neighborhood were not interested in details such 
as the name of the project. They wanted to make demands. 
</P>
<P>
The residents are vowing to erect a gate to control traffic through the area 
and to hire additional private patrols. They also plan to continue meeting with 
the developer, hoping to win road improvements and more neighborhood parks in 
exchange for community support for the project, which must win approval by City 
Hall and pass environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to join the new process in L.A. and start working with developers," 
Riffe said. "We're slowly finding out we have the same problems as everyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Their call to protect the Hollywood Hills echoes cries of other homeowner 
associations throughout Los Angeles that are increasingly pushing developers to 
pay for neighborhood improvements to compensate for the increased density, 
traffic and noise created by construction. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 residents who live perched on hillsides surrounding most of the 
Hollywood Reservoir, are represented by three homeowners associations -- 
Hollywood Knolls, Lake Hollywood Estates and Hollywoodland. 
</P>
<P>
The groups have not yet endorsed or opposed the 64-mansion project, opting to 
try to first work out their concerns with the developer. They are more worried 
about the effects the massive project will have on what has long been a 
peaceful community. 
</P>
<P>
Their big trouble is traffic -- not from their own cars, residents say, but 
from "outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic dramatically increased about a year ago after publication of book that 
listed a string of winding, narrow streets that could be used as a escape path 
from the clogged Hollywood Freeway through the Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care about the neighborhood," said Joe Nassour of the Lake 
Hollywood group. "These are frustrated commuters trying to save minutes, 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
The substandard, narrow roads with numerous hairpin turns were designed in the 
1920s and 1930s and cannot safely handle commuter traffic, said Horace Tramel, 
a senior city planner for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents fear that the proposed development will further exacerbate the 
problem because the developer plans to build a new mile-long road off Cahuenga 
Boulevard into the hills. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowner coalition wants Sullivan to help pay to install gates on the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
Groups leaders say they are just beginning to search for ways to close off 
their neighborhoods to outside traffic. Tramel said obtaining city permission 
to do so is a long and costly process that could entail exorbitant insurance 
and street maintenance costs for the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have enough political clout to get it done," said Howard Cohen, a 
resident and developer himself who in 1960 built the 133 houses that make up 
Lake Hollywood Estates. Other homeowners, however, are not so sure that 
cordoning off their neighborhood is the right action because the reservoir 
draws throngs of joggers, walkers and bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can try and buy anything, but I'm not sure about gates," said Neil 
Howard, an attorney who lives on busy Tahoe Drive with his wife and two 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents are pushing the developer to create another thoroughfare through 
the proposed "Palm-Air" development to share the traffic burden, a suggestion 
that Sullivan said is too costly. 
</P>
<P>
To appease the immediate complaints of homeowners, Sullivan has promised to 
clean up one neighborhood blight -- dumping along canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we can't stop development, but we can at least get things cleaned up" 
said Patty Howard. "Although it is going to be kind of sad when we lose the 
hillside." 
</P>

RAIDERS WON'T STAY, COLISEUM CHIEF PREDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan said Friday that he 
no longer believes the Los Angeles Raiders will stay in the Coliseum, and if 
Sacramento or Oakland can deliver on the $30 million to $50 million in cash 
they are promising to give the team for moving, "I think they have the 
Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan made his remarks on the eve of a much-ballyhooed exhibition game to be 
held tonight in Oakland between the Raiders and the Houston Oilers. It will be 
the first time the Raiders have played in Oakland since leaving for Los Angeles 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that team owner Al Davis might use the occasion to 
announce a permanent move to Oakland. Davis, however, dismissed that in 
interviews this week, saying he has not yet made up his mind where he will play 
in the 1990s and will not announce a decision this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis did not show up Friday night at a black-tie dinner in Oakland honoring 
six Raiders who made it into the Football Hall of Fame. George Vukasin, 
chairman of the Oakland Coliseum Commission, said Davis had told him that he 
wanted to spare himself the "emotion of the occasion," on the eve of tonight's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coliseum Commission Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis strongly criticized the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, as he 
has in the past, for allegedly breaking promises to him for Coliseum 
renovation, he also made certain conciliatory remarks about continuing to play 
in Los Angeles if the Coliseum were made into a more modern facility. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan, however, said Friday that he has become personally convinced that Los 
Angeles "is not a real alternative" in Davis' mind and that the Raiders owner 
does not even want to meet to discuss the possibility of continuing to play 
here after the initial term of his contract expires at the end of the 1991 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission president cited as proof Davis' persistent 
unwillingness to sign a statement agreeing that whatever would be said in such 
conversations could not be used later by either party in the commission's 
pending $57-million breach-of-contract lawsuit against the Raiders for the 
team's attempts to move to Irwindale before expiration of the lease in the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the proposed statement has been boiling for two months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last-Ditch Call' 
</P>
<P>
"We've now come down to offering him a one-sentence agreement we would both 
sign," Riordan said. "I have a last-ditch call in now to his attorney, Jeff 
Birren. It doesn't cost Davis a damn thing to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he believes that Davis is using the dispute over the statement "as 
an excuse for not meeting us." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't want to meet," Riordan said. "If we were a viable alternative, 
Davis would have signed that in a second because he doesn't lose anything. It 
leads me to believe we are not an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was not available for comment Friday. But in the interviews this week, he 
put full blame on the Coliseum Commission for poor relations with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said, "The only thing that could yet bring things around would be if we 
decided on our own to go ahead with Coliseum renovations and Oakland and 
Sacramento couldn't deliver on their promises" to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
However, a different assessment came from Irving Azoff, chairman of MCA Inc.'s 
Music Entertainment Group and a representative of the private business 
partnership that is managing the Los Angeles Coliseum complex. Azoff has been 
involved in sporadic contacts with Davis that were broken off Aug. 9 on 
commission orders because Davis had not signed the requested statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Sought 
</P>
<P>
Azoff said Friday that he is trying to work out through his and Davis' 
attorneys a compromise on the proposed statement that could allow talks to 
proceed among Davis, himself and other private managers representing the 
Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as pessimistic as Riordan," Azoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, in this week's interviews, said negotiators from MCA told him that they 
considered the Coliseum "a toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Azoff, asked about this Friday, replied: "I don't know it was me, but I assume 
it was. I've said that 5,000 times." 
</P>
<P>
What the remark is meant to convey, he said, is his belief that the 66-year-old 
Coliseum is dilapidated and needs to be reconstructed. He has proposed a 
$125-million reconstruction, mainly with private money.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $75 MILLION IN DRUGS SEIZED DURING RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police and federal agents investigating a network distributing cocaine in

ROBBERY RULED OUT AS MOTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SLAIN COUPLE'S SON SAYS NOTHING WAS TAKEN FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE and SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eldest son of slain entertainment executive Jose E. Menendez said Friday 
that robbery could not have been a motive for the killing of his father and 
mother because nothing was taken from the family's Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was missing," Lyle Menendez said. "Robbery wasn't a motive." 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, 45, the chief executive of Live Entertainment of Van Nuys, a firm 
that buys video rights to feature films, and his wife, Mary Louise (Kitty) 
Menendez, 44, were discovered shot to death in their North Elm Drive home by 
their two sons, Lyle, 21, and Eric, 18. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was held for Menendez on Friday in a screening room at the 
Hollywood headquarters of the Directors Guild of America. Another memorial 
service is planned for Monday in a chapel on the campus of Princeton University 
in New Jersey, where the family lived a few years ago and where Lyle attended 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Several Times 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office, after an autopsy of both bodies, said 
the entertainment executive and his wife had been shot several times. But, at 
the request of Beverly Hills police, the coroner refused to divulge any other 
details. 
</P>
<P>
From family comments Friday, there was clearly a consensus that the apparent 
double homicide was premeditated. But the family is still debating whether it 
was mob-ordered, as some in the media have speculated. Menendez headed a 
company that had purchased two firms that had previously been linked with 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
After the memorial service Friday, the slain executive's sister echoed this 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
The sister, Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., told the Associated 
Press that her brother and his wife were killed because Jose Menendez refused 
to do business with mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angered Mobsters 
</P>
<P>
The sister said that in her opinion, her brother angered mobsters for taking 
over International Video Entertainment, which had previously distributed 
X-rated films, and then cleaning house. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his success, he probably was stepping on many shoes, which some 
people didn't like," Menendez-Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, Lyle Menendez, talking with a Times reporter before leaving 
for Princeton, N.J., for the second memorial service, said he did not believe 
that his aunt's theory is entirely correct. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the family was all but convinced that the slayings were 
calculated. "Someone was trying to send a message," he said. But no one in the 
family has yet deciphered that message, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police have clamped a tight lid of secrecy on their 
investigation. No suspects have been identified.

More than 100 family members, friends and associates attended the memorial 
service Friday for Menendez and his wife. During the tribute, Menendez's 
colorful personal history emerged. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in the United States from Cuba at 16, Menendez slept in the 
attic of a Pennsylvania farmhouse, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez's father, Jose Francisco, a former world-class soccer player, and his 
mother, Maria Carlotta, a former Olympic swimmer, sent Menendez to the United 
States in 1960 after worrying that their son would turn to communism if he 
remained in Fidel Castro's Cuba, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. A little more than 10 years later, Menendez was the president of his 
first company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goal Recalled 
</P>
<P>
"He used to tell us that when he came to the U.S., he didn't speak much English 
. . . but he said he made it his goal to run one of the largest companies in 
America," said one of his sons, Eric Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez was eager to begin working full time after finishing high school. 
Already a winning salesman, he considered selling encyclopedias, relatives 
said. But he was persuaded to attend college in Illinois. There he met his 
future wife in a philosophy class. A short time later, Mary Louise, known as 
Kitty, and Jose, 18 and 19 years old, were married. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that was his first acquisition in the entertainment business," said 
Devendra Mishra, executive vice president of Live Entertainment. "She was an 
athlete and a serious performer." 
</P>
<P>
The couple moved to New York, where Kitty worked as a schoolteacher and 
Menendez completed a degree in accounting at Queens College in 1967. Five years 
later, Menendez was named president of a small container company, and he went 
on to begin a 14-year career with RCA Corp., eventually serving as the head of 
RCA/Ariola Records until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Menendez quit RCA to take over an ailing video distribution and 
duplication firm in Newbury Park that he reorganized into the now profitable 
Live Entertainment. Menendez and his family moved from Princeton, N.J., to 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Charismatic Leader 
</P>
<P>
Live Entertainment executives and relatives who spoke at the service said 
Menendez was a charismatic leader who sometimes used humor to soften his 
hard-driving competitive spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to have arguments with my father all the time," Lyle Menendez said. 
"And I rarely won one." 
</P>
<P>
Kitty's brother, Brian Anderson, said his sister was a competitive, precocious 
"tomboy" while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"As competitive and aggressive as she was, it intensified when she and Jose 
married," Anderson said. "Jose certainly had met his challenge when he and 
Kitty became man and wife."

PROGRAM GIVES YOUNGSTERS A SHORT BREAK FROM GANG-INFESTED AREAS;

A DAY AT BEACH AND AWAY FROM REALITY

Nicholas Conway is big for his age. The sixth-grader-to-be at 93rd Street 
Elementary School is only 10, but he is built like a lineman on a junior high 
school football team. Teasing isn't the problem. The problem is that Nicholas 
lives in the Avalon Gardens housing project in a home right by McKinley Street, 
a demarcation between the Crips and Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
Little gangsters, Nicholas has learned, tend to pick on kids their own size. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Nicholas was outside his home when he heard shooting across 
the street, he said. When he ran for a gap between houses, "they started 
shooting -- pow, pow, like that. . . . They were shooting at me." 
</P>
<P>
"They be shooting out there sometimes," affirmed Bryan McKinney, age 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Day Off 
</P>
<P>
But last Thursday, Nicholas and Bryan were given the day off from such 
realities, transported to a privileged world with a different set of turf 
rules. They were among about 60 children from Avalon Gardens and other 
Southside neighborhoods who were invited to spend a day at the beach as guests 
of the private Sand and Sea Club in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we're going to a private beach! Where rich people go!" said Tazie Ashley, 
11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go surfing," said Tenisha Collins, also 11. Tenisha said she likes 
the beach: "I think it's fun because your parents don't get mad at you if you 
have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hazy day, but that didn't seem to matter. When the bus rumbled through 
the tunnel where the Santa Monica Freeway merges with Pacific Coast Highway, 
the kids gazed out at the Pacific and most seemed excited. 
</P>
<P>
Vontrell Lewis, 12, nervously eyed the horizon: "The waves can pull you out 
there, can't they?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer-Long Program 
</P>
<P>
All of these kids said they had been to the beach before, some just once. The 
fact that many inner-city children grow up without seeing the ocean inspired 
the summer-long beach program, sponsors say. About 10 groups have made the 
sojourn since Ike Jones, a TV producer, put the endeavor together with the 
Brotherhood Crusade community improvement group and Sand and Sea owner Doug 
Badt. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jones said, the plan was to mix fun with lectures about the evils of 
drugs and gangs: "But the more we thought about it, we decided, why not just 
let them play?" 
</P>
<P>
They hear plenty of lectures, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"This sort of thing has to happen all the time," said Leon Watkins, a community 
activist with Brotherhood Crusade. "If they see somebody trying to help them, 
then maybe they'll want to help themselves later on." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who grew up in Santa Monica, said he tried to recruit two more exclusive 
private beach clubs to participate, including one where he said as a youth he 
had worked "cleaning toilets." The clubs turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other beach clubs, which have exclusive membership rules, Sand and Sea 
has no membership restrictions other than its $1,950 a year fee for families 
and a cap on enrollment at 700 families. It operates as a private concession on 
state park land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built By Hearst 
</P>
<P>
The club's structures are what remains of a lavish beach estate built in 1929 
by William Randolph Hearst for actress Marion Davies. 
</P>
<P>
The membership rules of other beach clubs, Badt said, have helped make the Sand 
and Sea about 75% Jewish. On this day, though, the Sand and Sea was about 90% 
black and 5% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The kids were on the beach for about two hours. They seemed to act like any 
other kids at the beach, which of course was the point of the entire exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas splashed in the surf. Bryan raced the tide. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels funny," Nicholas said, feeling sand underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
Vontrell stood a good long while at the water's edge, wary. He asked once again 
about the pull of the tide. Finally, he ventured in and lived to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
The Vasquez brothers -- 10-year-old Jesus, 8-year-old Esau, and 6-year-old 
Lionel -- spent much of the day building their own private sandcastle.

COUNCIL TO CONTINUE FUNDING LATCHKEY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to continue subsidizing after-school 
recreation programs at 306 elementary and junior high schools in the city to 
help keep so-called latchkey children off the street while their parents work. 
</P>
<P>
In approving an agreement with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the 
council committed $4.5 million for the supervised programs between 4 and 6 p.m. 
each weekday. The money will also pay for about 11 hours of weekend programming 
at some of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has traditionally provided recreation programs on weekdays 
between 2 and 4 p.m. but has been unable to afford the later hours. Last fall, 
the council began subsidizing the programs when it agreed to pay $1.8 million 
for the second half of the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidy Called a Bargain 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs said the subsidy represents a bargain for city taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"The program overall is a lot better than we were able to provide on our own," 
Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district estimates that 21,000 students take advantage of the 
programs, which involve arts and crafts, drama, sports, drill teams, roller 
skating and other recreational activities. They are provided at schools that 
are more than three blocks from recreational facilities or other organizations 
that offer similar programs. The latchkey program is open to all 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the council refused to approve the agreement because of 
concerns that the district was asking for too much money. City officials had 
expected to pay about $3.5 million for the coming year's programs, but school 
district officials said they need $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs and several of his colleagues who earlier objected to the request said 
Friday that they are now convinced that the school district needs the 
additional money. School board President Jackie Goldberg, who attended Friday's 
council meeting to lobby for the money, said the added costs were for such 
things as custodian overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Is 'Not the Enemy' 
</P>
<P>
The district estimates that it contributes about $660,000 for the extended 
programs through higher utility bills, clerical and administrative support and 
training sessions. Goldberg said the district cannot afford to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember the school board is not the enemy," Councilman Marvin 
Braude told the council. "It is not a foreign country." 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Ernani Bernardi voted against the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is such a great program, which it is, then require them to fund it," he 
said.

POPE MEETS SENIOR SOVIET ENVOY FOR TALKS ON RELIGION, MIDEAST

<P>
Pope John Paul II met a senior Soviet envoy this week for talks on religious 
freedom and the Middle East, the Vatican said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks with Yuri Karlov, a personal representative of Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, follow reports that the Vatican is studying a 
possible papal visit to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish-born pontiff is also widely expected to have an unprecedented 
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if Gorbachev goes ahead with a 
visit to Italy in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Karlov discussed matters of common interest with the Holy Father, such as 
religious freedom and peace in the world, with particular reference to the 
Middle East," Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican and diplomatic sources say the Vatican has been studying the 
feasibility of a lightning trip by John Paul to Lebanon. On Aug. 15, the Pope 
said he felt an "interior command" to go there because of the upsurge in 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
He has directly accused Syria of seeking the destruction of the country and 
appealed for an immediate end to fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican-Soviet relations have warmed gradually since June, 1988, when a 
top-level Catholic delegation visited the Soviet Union for celebrations to mark 
1,000 years of Russian Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
But a major problem remains the Soviet Union's continued ban on the underground 
Ukrainian Catholic Church, which Moscow does not recognize.

SEMINARY HEAD TO STAY IN POST PENDING RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Robert D. Preus will remain president of Concordia Seminary in Ft. 
Wayne, Ind., pending a court decision on whether he can be removed from office 
while appealing a board of regents decision that he be "honorably retired." 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling issued Aug. 14, the Allen County, Ind., circuit court granted a 
temporary restraining order that keeps Preus in office until arguments are 
concluded on an injunction that would allow him to remain president during the 
entire appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing process began Wednesday but was continued until Sept. 11, according 
to a court official. 
</P>
<P>
The regents voted July 27, by a 5-3 majority, to "honorably retire" Preus, who 
has the reputation of being a staunch conservative within the already 
conservative Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. In their resolution the regents 
praised Preus' accomplishments at the seminary and in the church but said he 
could no longer serve effectively in the face of "turmoil within the faculty 
and staff." 
</P>
<P>
The seminary was recently censured for violations of academic freedom by the 
American Assn. of University Professors, which charged the school with 
requiring faculty doctrinal commitments that are "incompatible with academic 
freedom as generally understood and upheld at American institutions of higher 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the church, the circuit court issued the temporary 
restraining order Aug. 14, one day before Preus' retirement was to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The church also reported that two of the three regents who voted against the 
forced retirement of Preus have issued a public protest of the regents' action. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Donald E. Kirchner of Chestnut, Ill., and the Rev. Raymond Mueller of 
Rocky River, Ohio, said they believe the action violates the regents' handbook 
and deprives Preus of appeal rights spelled out in the church's constitution. 
In addition, they objected to the "precipitousness" of the retirement, pointing 
out that there were only 19 days between the vote and the scheduled retirement. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy at the seminary is the June, 1988, firing of 
tenured Prof. Alvin J. Schmidt, who is suing the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt was fired on grounds that he advocated the ordination of women in 
opposition to the synod's official position. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort at compromise, Schmidt signed a prepared statement recognizing 
that there are some biblical texts that forbid female ministers, but he added 
an amendment expressing a desire to continue pursing his "right to academic 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
However, Preus rejected the statement and ordered that Schmidt be fired.

For the second time this summer, state Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) has 
entered an alcohol rehabilitation center, a spokesman for Senate President Pro 
Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Glazer said the 57-year-old Greene checked into a Southern California 
clinic shortly before the Legislature ended its summer recess Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know his return. I expect him to be here for the end of the session," 
Glazer quoted Roberti as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Greene acknowledged that he is an alcoholic and revealed that in the 
past, he had attended legislative committees with a "full tank of liquor in 
me." 
</P>
<P>
At Roberti's urging, Greene said he had joined Alcoholics Anonymous and checked 
into a rehabilitation program but withdrew after four days.

DAVIS SAYS HE HAS $8 BILLION TO BUY UAL, URGES ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, stepping up the pressure on UAL Corp. 
Friday, said he has lined up $8 billion to pay for the company and gave its 
board six days to make a decision on his $275-a-share bid for the parent of 
United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he would deliver $1 billion cash equity, some of which he expected 
to get from unnamed domestic and foreign partners. Davis said he arranged to 
borrow the remaining $7 billion from Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
"With this financing information, the UAL board should now be in a position to 
take action on our proposal," Davis said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' financing package exceeds the size of his bid by $1.8 billion, 
indicating that he might raise his offer. In the statement, Davis said he 
expected to use a portion of the bank loan to refinance some of UAL's existing 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's shares rose $10 Friday, closing at $278 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Try to Unseat Board 
</P>
<P>
United is the nation's second-largest airline, behind American Airlines. It has 
an extensive domestic route system and valuable Pacific routes to Japan and 
other Asian countries. Besides Davis, Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and a 
partnership that includes British Airways and the New York investment bank of 
Morgan Stanley are said to be interested in United. The UAL board has said it 
has not decided whether to sell the airline. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear Friday what action Davis might take if UAL rejects his offer. 
"We want to see the board either decide to sell, or solicit bids in the context 
of pursuing all its alternatives," a source close to Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has said he would seek the consent of shareholders to unseat UAL's 
directors, except Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf, if the board 
fails to act on his offer. Davis could also launch a tender offer, as he did 
earlier this year during his unsuccessful pursuit of NWA Inc., the parent of 
Northwest Airlines. NWA was ultimately acquired by an investor group led by Los 
Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts speculated that Davis might be joined in his bid for 
UAL by a foreign airline looking for greater access to the U.S. market, such as 
Lufthansa of West Germany or Air France. Analysts speculated that Citibank 
might contribute equity. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign airlines are on everyone's list," said a source close to Davis, who 
added that equity participation by Citibank was "possible but not likely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ownership Stake for Employees 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Davis' equity contribution seemed low, given the amount that he 
said he expects to borrow. Without a larger equity cushion, they added, the 
airline could suffer during an economic downturn, when travel slows. The Davis 
proposal "doesn't leave much room for error," said Robert Decker, an analyst 
with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Friend, president of United's flight attendants' union, said she was 
impressed by Davis' proposal. "I would say $1 billion in equity is very 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been trying to win support for his bid from United's labor 
organizations. He met Friday morning with advisers to the airline's machinists' 
union and has met several times with pilots' representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's statement, Davis said he intends to offer employees an ownership 
stake in United through an employee stock ownership plan. The pilots have been 
especially keen on forming an ESOP and have reportedly discussed the 
possibility of creating one as part of an employee-management buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Roth, a Burbank attorney representing the machinists' union, described the 
meeting with Davis as "very constructive" but said it was too early to take a 
position on Davis' ESOP proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The machinist perspective is (that) we are not looking for a buyer, we are not 
interested in a leveraged buyout, we are not interested in a restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the pilots' union could not be reached Friday. A source close 
to Davis said the pilots have $300 million that could be used as equity in a 
buyout plan.

GIBRALTAR THRIFTS' LOSS HITS $337.5 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gibraltar Savings and its sister Gibraltar Savings Bank, two Simi Valley-based 
thrifts being operated under the supervision of federal regulators, said Friday 
that they lost a combined $337.5 million in the second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The record loss for the institutions was expected, confirming figures released 
earlier this week by the Office of Thrift Supervision, a new federal agency 
that is mopping up the nation's thrift mess. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar Savings, the larger of the two with 83 branches in California, lost 
$330.1 million in the quarter, while Gibraltar Savings Bank, which operates 25 
branches in Washington and Florida, lost $7.4 million. The loss for the thrifts 
in the first six months of 1989 totaled $398.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mortgage-Backed Securities 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the Gibraltar losses were non-operating ones, as overvalued 
assets on Gibraltar's books were written down to their market value or assets 
were sold at a loss. The moves are being taken as authorities try to whip the 
troubled operations into shape so they can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Gibraltar assets sold so far have been mortgage-backed securities 
-- securities in which investors are paid off with principal and interest 
payments on underlying mortgages. James Boyle, Gibraltar Savings executive vice 
president and chief operating officer, said the institution has sold about half 
of its $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities, a large portion of them last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Boyle said, about $400 million worth of Gibraltar's $500-million 
portfolio of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds has been sold. 
</P>
<P>
The two thrifts were previously operated by Gibraltar Financial in Beverly 
Hills until regulators seized the operations March 31. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Losses at Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
Because of its large branch system, Gibraltar has attracted widespread interest 
among potential buyers. Boyle confirmed that about a dozen potential buyers 
have shown interest, including other thrifts, banks and foreign investors. He 
said Gibraltar probably will be sold in three to four months. 
</P>
<P>
As big as it was, Gibraltar's loss in the second quarter was dwarfed by losses 
at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, an Irvine-based institution seized by regulators 
in April. Lincoln lost $788 million in the second quarter and $847 million in 
the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Together, losses at Lincoln and Gibraltar made up 80% of the $1.5-billion loss 
posted in the second quarter by thrifts in the San Francisco Home Loan Bank 
district, which includes California, Arizona and Nevada.

STOCK RALLY TAKES BREATHER; DOW OFF 2.28

Stock prices edged lower Friday, weighed down by soft bond prices and a late 
bout of profit taking one day after the market rocketed in a broad-based rally 
to an all-time closing high. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had climbed 56.53 points Thursday, 
slipped back 2.28 to 2,732.36. That left the average with a net gain of 44.39 
points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 716 up, 798 down and 485 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.93 million shares, down from 
225.52 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the dramatic gains of 
stock prices lately. 
</P>
<P>
But prices generally held steady on the strength of the enthusiasm generated by 
Thursday's record high and the widespread public attention it received. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the losses it 
suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing confidence that the 
Federal Reserve can restrain inflation without causing a recession. 
</P>
<P>
They also note that corporate earnings have risen sharply in the past two 
years, making the perceived risk in stocks less than it was when the market 
peaked out two years ago Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks ended higher but sharply below their session peaks. The 
Financial Times 100-share average ended up 10.7 points at 2,393.1, down from a 
session high of 2,404.5. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell after traders dumped Treasury securities in a late-afternoon 
selloff, market watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11/32 of a point, or $3.44 for every 
$1,000 in face amount.

EASTERN MEETS SAFETY STANDARDS DESPITE STRIKE, FAA CONCLUDES

Eastern Airlines appears to be meeting federal safety standards despite a 
six-month strike against the carrier, according to a Federal Aviation 
Administration report filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the FAA said Eastern's top management "has exhibited a more compliant 
attitude toward its regulatory safety responsibilities" since the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment of safety at Eastern, which gradually has been restoring 
operations since a strike shut it down March 5, is contained in a report filed 
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York where Eastern is seeking protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Machinists, which represents mechanics and ground 
crews, struck the airline over proposed concessions in pay and benefits. Most 
of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants honored the picket lines. Eastern has 
rebuilt some of its operations by hiring new employees. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's unions have frequently questioned the airline's safety because former 
managers and clerical employees have replaced striking workers. But the FAA, 
which has stepped up surveillance of the airline because of the strike, found 
no evidence of such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the pilots union said the FAA's view of safety at Eastern is 
not warranted and that significant safety problems remain as a result of having 
to throw inexperienced workers into jobs.

Cineplex to Repurchase Screens: Cineplex Odeon announced that it would 
repurchase 153 motion picture screens in Canada for $47 million ($55.25 million 
Canadian) from affiliates of Carena Developments Ltd., which had purchased the 
theaters a year ago. When the earlier transaction took place, Cineplex netted 
about $51.4 million (Canadian) after paying certain fees. Cineplex -- itself on 
the auction block -- said it was repurchasing the theaters because of renewed 
box office strength in Canada.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE OFF MOCA MURAL CONTROVERSIAL LITTLE TOKYO ART WORK TO BE 
CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A controversy over inclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance in a huge mural on the 
wall of the Museum of Contemporary Art's (MOCA) Temporary Contemporary in 
Little Tokyo has been resolved -- but the settlement includes complete 
elimination of the wording of the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual resolution, disclosed Friday morning, neutralizes objections by 
some Little Tokyo residents, who complained that being forced to scrutinize the 
Pledge of Allegiance in a form 29 feet high and 218 feet wide would be a slap 
at Japanese-Americans who endured the internment camps of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Goldstein, a MOCA assistant curator who has coordinated the project, 
insisted the decision to drop the pledge from the mural "is not a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said that, because the revised mural proposal is a variance from a 
version originally approved by the city Cultural Affairs Commission, the new, 
pledge-less design must be presented again to the city agency. Commission 
approval is necessary because the building housing the Temporary Contemporary 
is city property. 
</P>
<P>
The mural is to be executed by New York artist Barbara Kruger, who flew to Los 
Angeles for a Thursday night meeting with the Little Tokyo Community 
Development Advisory Committee, members of which had first objected to the 
subject matter. Kruger was not available for comment Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
As originally proposed by Kruger, the mural would have been red, white and blue 
with the wording of the Pledge of Allegiance surrounded by such questions as 
"Who is bought and sold?" "Who is beyond the law?" and "Who does time?" Instead 
of being red, white and blue, the new version of the mural will be red on the 
white background of the existing Temporary Contemporary exterior wall. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to initial community concerns at a meeting last month, Kruger 
proposed to enlarge the questions and make the pledge wording significantly 
smaller, but to retain the flag-like color combination. At Thursday's meeting, 
Kruger proposed elimination of the wording of the pledge completely in a major 
change of the nature of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a process that is not an unusual process for this artist," Goldstein 
said. "She presented proposals to the community. She feels this is part of a 
collaborative effort. Sensitivities that were indicated to her about the Pledge 
of Allegiance she took very seriously."

THE WHO'S CLASSIC RETAINS ITS FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
Even at a benefit concert like Thursday's star-studded performance of "Tommy," 
put on by the Who at the Universal Amphitheatre, it's easy to find cynics. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the current Who tour's controversial brewery sponsorship, one wag 
suggested that maybe the rock opera's troubled title character could appear in 
a beer commercial -- as in, maybe, "That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure can 
knock 'em back!" 
</P>
<P>
Cheap shot. Uncalled for. Irascible. 
</P>
<P>
But then, "Tommy" itself was a fairly acerbic work, especially for its dreamy, 
idealistic year, 1969. If the Who's world-weary anthem "Won't Get Fooled Again" 
later served as the final benediction for the '60s, then the enduringly 
brilliant "Tommy" -- and its song of rebellion against the spiritual path, 
"We're Not Gonna Take It" -- may have been cynical enough to be the era's first 
real musical death knell. 
</P>
<P>
Its climactic vision of a nation of young seekers giving up on the search and 
rising up against their ascetic pop guru was plenty prophetic, whether you want 
to relate it to a generation deserting its ideals or simply to songwriter Pete 
Townshend's eventually disassociating himself from his own avatar of the time, 
Meher Baba, who was credited with helping inspire "Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the anger and disillusionment that may have fired the original "Tommy" 
still came across in Thursday's sold-out performance (which was seen nationally 
as a pay-per-view TV event, in addition to the estimated 6,000 who paid from 
$75 to $1,500 to witness the show in person). 
</P>
<P>
There was some fire and brimstone there. Townshend even menacingly aimed his 
guitar neck at the audience, Tommy-gun style (ahem), during a rat-a-tat-tat 
passage of "We're Not Gonna Take It," mirroring the experience of a public 
taking up arms against its artists and prophets. 
</P>
<P>
But this run-through of the most famous of all rock concept albums was not big 
on emotion, nor geared toward theatricality. Clearly, the Who was not relating 
to "Tommy" as a moving story with big themes so much as just a piece of music 
to be played for old time's sake. 
</P>
<P>
And to be played around with, for new time's sake. What the three surviving Who 
members, their 12 back-up musicians and their five celebrity guests did to 
rearrange the work probably didn't add up to any Who fan's ultimate "Tommy," 
but it was a gas nonetheless, and not just for sentimental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The pageant of guest stars may have distracted and detracted from the piece's 
thematic strengths, but their presence no doubt nudged along the Who's 
willingness to have a little fun with the musical aspects. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's most radical rethink: Steve Winwood's rendition of "Eyesight to 
the Blind," which, backed by five horns and three singers, suddenly sounded 
very much like a slick, up-tempo R&amp;B rave-up that wouldn't have been at all 
out of place on his own "Back in the High Life" album. 
</P>
<P>
Most electrifying vocal: With Who lead singer Roger Daltrey not quite at his 
finest, honors easily went to Patti LaBelle as the viciously seductive Acid 
Queen. 
</P>
<P>
Best typecasting: Bad boy Billy Idol as the nasty Cousin Kevin, liberally 
sprinkling his promises of baseless cruelty to little Tommy with profanity. 
Underneath this, the big band found a musical intensity of almost metallic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Most game guest: Phil Collins as the child molester Uncle Ernie, the only 
performer of the evening to attempt to actually act out his role. Even the 
stone-faced Townshend had to break up at the sight of Collins in a raincoat and 
boxer shorts, sporting one of those "comb-over" hair jobs -- with the hair 
combed over down front, to approximate bangs. 
</P>
<P>
Letdown: Elton John, usually a galvanizing presence on any stage, surprisingly 
subdued reprising his movie role singing "Pinball Wizard." 
</P>
<P>
You'd have to be as single-minded as Tommy himself to focus on the story amid 
this parade of celebs, not to mention Daltrey's still-swell microphone-swinging 
and Townshend's leaps. Nevertheless, it holds up as a sprawling epic that moves 
with admirable cohesion from pulp melodrama to a saga of cruelty to a spiritual 
odyssey to a satirical commentary on pop/religious culture. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, how's this for an unhappy ending: For the climactic "Listening to 
You," the "cast" rejoined the band -- dominated by a self-impressed Idol 
bounding about, bound and determined to be as obnoxiously omnipresent as 
possible. Was this his show or the Who's? 
</P>
<P>
The hour-plus "Tommy" presentation was followed by a generous greatest-hits 
set, anticlimactic only in that the Who seems less willing to "fiddle about" 
with the arrangements of its other material than it does with its 
lovable-albatross rock opera. 
</P>
<P>
The organizations benefiting from the performance were the Gilbert W. Lindsay 
Children's Center at California Medical Center Los Angeles, United Friends of 
the Children, MacLaren Children's Center, Westside Children's Center and the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The Who will perform many more of its hits, along with a condensed "Tommy," 
tonight at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

JACKSON BROWNE, HIT BY SAGGING ALBUM SALES, FACES LITMUS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson Browne said that, in writing "Enough of the Night," he had pictured 
"this imaginary woman," before he realized "the person I was writing to was 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"You've had enough of the night to fill the street with tears," the song goes. 
"You've had enough of those empty hours to last a thousand years." 
</P>
<P>
Browne, who turned 40 last year, said that he was writing about a way of life 
that included drugs, especially cocaine, which he and his nose have left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wasn't writing about giving up political commitment, the need for 
which is the theme of his new album, "World in Motion," which contains "Enough 
of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by disappointing sales of "World in Motion," he hopes that an otherwise 
loyal following has not had enough of Browne. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get a litmus test tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and Sunday night 
at the Open Air Theatre at San Diego State University, where he closes his 
national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's ninth album, "World in Motion," took three years to complete. The tour 
that followed its release has been a three-month marathon plagued, in some 
cities, by bad weather and bad sales. Almost everywhere he went, however, 
Browne's show, which features his reunion with alter ego David Lindley, drew 
praise from critics. 
</P>
<P>
Browne used the album to make familiar statements about nuclear disarmament, 
hunger, racism and the "secret" government that gave rise to Oliver North and 
the Iran-Contra scandal. For whatever reason, many critics didn't bite. Some 
wrote that Browne is better off as a composer of beautiful ballads than as a 
political theoretician. It must have seemed like a bit of a backhanded 
compliment when "The New Rolling Stone Record Guide" labeled him "the most 
accomplished lyricist of the Seventies." "I'm amazed that some of the things I 
talk about on the album are controversial," Browne said backstage before one of 
his recent shows. "People don't have to feel personally attacked when someone 
raises these questions, when someone suggests that things have got to change. 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing that amazes me the most is that this album is not limited to 
social issues, even though some critics think it is. I'm writing about peace, 
not only in the context of international relations but in relationships, in 
love. I think there's a stunning parallel between peace in our own lives and 
peace outside our doors. I wanted to make a record that explored the connection 
between these things. I wasn't trying to fix anything." 
</P>
<P>
Browne said he was disillusioned with media that seem more concerned with 
trivia -- such as his relationship with actress Daryl Hannah, or whether he's 
listed in "The Andy Warhol Diaries" (he is, on page 23) -- than with the 
workings of a shadow government. 
</P>
<P>
He said his expectations for the album were "out there," and he was less than 
thrilled with its initial reception. He sounded ruffled at Elektra Records for 
having "no desire" to release "The Word Justice," the album's most blatantly 
political song, as a single. The album's title song was released as a single 
but did not do well, and the album reached a peak of No. 45 on the Billboard 
magazine album chart a month ago before dropping to 73, 80, and this week to 
85. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thomas Noonan, album chart manager for Billboard, said he expects 
"World in Motion" to turn around before the end of the year. He said the 
album's bad luck says as much about the record industry as it does about 
Browne. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get off the mark with the right single, and the single is what 
drives the album in a promotional sense," Noonan said. "Even so, the album has 
sold more than 360,000 copies, and 500,000 is a gold record. It's not a bomb 
album, by any stretch. Trust me, it will go gold." 
</P>
<P>
But all of Browne's previous albums have gone platinum (more than 1 million 
copies sold), so even if "World in Motion" goes gold, it would be considered a 
qualified success. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan said any album has to be played by radio stations -- and played 
repeatedly in its opening weeks -- to be a success. He said the gray area that 
Browne and many artists who appeal to the "thirtysomething" generation fall 
into is that radio stations "don't quite know where to put them." 
</P>
<P>
They're not Hard Rock, and they're hardly Easy Listening or Country, so what, 
exactly, are they? Despite the gray, peers and long-time friends of Browne such 
as Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Phoebe Snow, own albums that have climbed near 
the top of the charts in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the age of the artists or the category they fall into, Noonan said 
videos go a long way toward selling records in the 1980s. It doesn't matter 
whether they're on MTV or its yuppie counterpart, Video Hits 1, videos sell, 
Noonan said. Browne's first from the new album -- "Anything Can Happen," about 
the perils of falling in love in a country beset by war -- won't be released 
until next week . . . if then. 
</P>
<P>
Browne, who's known as a perfectionist, "hasn't approved the video yet," Noonan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Television has helped Browne in other ways, as it will any artist who falls 
into radio's gray area. Lisa Millman, a spokeswoman for Elektra, said that 
sales of "World in Motion" were boosted by Browne's recent appearances on "Late 
Night With David Letterman" and "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
One of the curious problems facing Browne and other artists who are roughly his 
age -- and who appeal to crowds in their 30s and 40s -- is that a mob of them 
is touring the country this year, pushing new albums. A partial list includes 
Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan, the Allman Brothers, The Who, Carole King, Chicago, the 
Beach Boys, Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones. Much of their appeal seems geared 
to nostalgia, reunions among band members or both. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that exists with Browne and Lindley -- "Running on Empty," Browne's 
biggest-selling album, was one of the hottest of 1977. Some of the songs from 
that album are among the most popular of the current tour. 
</P>
<P>
Browne and Lindley say they don't foresee performing together in a live show 
with a full band any time soon after this tour. Lindley's fiddle and lap steel 
guitar were essentials on every Browne album, from his debut effort in 1972 
through "Hold Out" in 1980. Some critics feel that Browne's efforts have not 
been as solid since Lindley embarked on a solo career. It is their unusual 
chemistry -- Browne's passionate singing fueled by Lindley's instrumentation -- 
that led Rolling Stone to label the live show "a guaranteed killer." 
</P>
<P>
For Browne, tonight's outing at Irvine Meadows will be something of a 
homecoming. He grew up in Fullerton, graduated from Sunny Hills High School and 
cut his musical teeth at the Orange County folk club, the Paradox. Despite 
"Enough of the Night," he remembers nights at the Paradox "as if they were 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
As for critics who don't appreciate his "World," he said with a smile, "This is 
what I've served up. It doesn't mean you have to come to dinner . . . although 
I'd like it if you would."

THE TOUGH, TENDER WORLD OF PLAYWRIGHT MEYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlane Meyer looks too hip and stylish to be part of the shadowy world of porn 
queens and gay hustlers, hit men and small-time thieves chronicled in her first 
two plays. 
</P>
<P>
She seems even less a survivor of the twilit back streets of Las Vegas, the 
site of her new drama, "The Geography of Luck," opening tonight at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. It revolves around a former rockabilly star paroled 
from his penitentiary sentence after killing his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't write with my own blood," she says. "I write with other people's 
blood." She pauses a beat. "The blood of virgins is usually what I use." 
</P>
<P>
The playwright is wearing a black double-breasted leather jacket, black jeans, 
black shoes and black sunglasses. Blackest of all, her hair is cut short on top 
and swept back at the sides. She takes out a bottle of cherry-red cough syrup 
and sets it on the table. Then she orders a cup of hot tea and apologizes for a 
wracking cough. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great person for sitting in a bar and talking to anybody who shows up," 
she says. "I was always good at that, even as a kid. I don't know if it was the 
'50s or what it was, but my parents used to go to bars and bring me along. I 
used to do my homework in bars. And people would sit down and talk to me. 
They'd tell me their stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I had tough parents. They weren't tough on me. They were just full of 
emotional energy. They were life-aholics. Hungry for experience. It was great 
to be in the wake of that because it makes you a natural voyeur. You're always 
watching people engaged in this life-and-death struggle, which is perfect if 
you're going to be a writer." 
</P>
<P>
In "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish," Meyer dug below the surface of contemporary 
life to a bedrock of desperate alienation. Now, in "The Geography of Luck," she 
has created what Nelson Algren once termed a "neon wilderness" of sorrow laced 
with black humor and bitter dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"People on the fringe were always interesting to me," she says. "They'll tell 
you things about themselves. People in the mainstream won't tell you anything. 
They know things and they have secrets. But they won't tell you. Who knows why? 
Fringe types will tell you everything they ever thought, every mistake they 
ever made. And they'll offer it up to you as a gift." 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old playwright had written about a dozen plays before her 
breakthrough with "Etta Jenks," which opened at the Los Angeles Theatre Center 
in January, 1988, after winning the Joseph Kesselring Award in a national 
competition the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
She says some of her earlier works had been "produced around" at the Found 
Theatre, in the utility room of the Uprising Bookstore at Cal State Long Beach, 
where she went to school, and in various workshops in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been writing since I was 23," Meyer says, sipping on the hot tea. "But I 
guess it wasn't until four years ago that I finally felt like I was starting to 
gain some muscle and control." 
</P>
<P>
Her success hasn't relieved the pain of the personal traumas that have come her 
way lately. "It's been rough," says Meyer, citing her mother's death last year 
and a divorce. "That makes two of the five most stressful things that can 
happen to you. An abortion must be next." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's sly sense of humor, which is also apparent throughout her plays, belies 
any suggestion of the psychological frailty that she claims. Indeed, her 
background would seem to confirm a temperamental sturdiness influenced by an 
unusual combination of factors, including her parents' interracial marriage and 
a spinal tumor that prompted several operations and kept her in and out of 
plaster body casts for the first 12 years of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Illness not only taught her the virtues of solitude so useful to a writer, but 
helped shape a dual aspect of her creativity. "Being a sick kid makes you very 
vulnerable," Meyer says. "I was always an object of ridicule in that body cast. 
I think you develop sensitivity and strength from that." 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Francisco and raised in San Pedro, Meyer calls herself Polynesian 
and says her extraction is Hawaiian and American Indian on her father's side 
and Swedish and German on her mother's side. She is the eldest of five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was in the merchant marine and we always had to live by a harbor. He's 
dark and my mother was light. I used to think of them as Lucille Ball and Desi 
Arnaz. They were great parents for me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "there was usually a space between what they wanted to have happen and 
what actually happened," she says. "They couldn't connect the dots." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer recently moved from Los Angeles to New York, and now lives at the 
southern tip of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she says. "It's easier for me to date in New York, number one. And 
I like the way New York looks. I get so much energy off of having something to 
look at. I always felt there was nothing to look at in Los Angeles. I love 
tight, vertical cities. I love the compression of having 5 million people in 
one block." 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything about her hometown that she misses? Meyer pauses to think, 
then smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"The daydreaming. You know how you spend hours in your car listening to the 
radio and just staring out the window? The drive time gave me an opportunity to 
daydream. That's what I really miss. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to stare out the window because what you're really looking at is 
something in your head, something in your heart. That's where those ideas for 
plays come from, those inarticulate moments when nothing is happening."

DONOHO TO DO TRIVIA ON 'MONDAY NIGHT LIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KABC-TV sportscaster Todd Donoho, who has been posing trivia questions to 
Channel 7 anchors Paul Moyer and Ann Martin on the 11 p.m. news since his debut 
July 10, is about to do the same for prime-time viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sept. 11, Donoho will be hosting "Monday Night Live," what he 
describes as a "catch-as-catch can, three-ring circus of a show" following 
"Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
The first installment of "Monday Night Live" will air at approximately 10 p.m., 
after the New York Giants-Washington Redskins game and a network special on the 
20th anniversary of "Monday Night Football." It will then move into its regular 
time slot of approximately 9 p.m. on Sept. 18, where it will remain for the 
entire 16-week run of "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
"Monday Night Live" was born out of the necessity to solve KABC-TV's 
post-"Monday Night Football" scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you never knew how long the game would run, you didn't know if you 
needed to fill an hour, 90 minutes or whatever," Donoho said. "We'll be the big 
exception, an expandable or collapsible show." 
</P>
<P>
"MacGyver" will follow "Monday Night Live" at 10 p.m., giving "Eyewitness News" 
a guaranteed 11 p.m. start, something it had not had in the past after "Monday 
Night Football." Last season, "MacGyver" followed "Monday Night Football,", 
with back-to-back episodes of "Eye on Hollywood," the syndicated version of 
"Eye on L.A." filling the time before the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you never know when a sporting event will end, you either have to join 
a show in progress, which can upset the viewer, or play it in its entirety so 
your news will not come on in at its regular time, something I, as news 
director, would prefer not to do," Channel 7 News Director Roger Bell said. 
"Now we'll be able to able to accordion 'Monday Night Live' to fit the 
remainder of the hour." 
</P>
<P>
Donoho said approximately 40% of the show will be spent asking callers' trivia 
questions, with prizes going to those who answer correctly. It is a format 
similar to "Time Out For Trivia," which Donoho hosted on Score, the sports arm 
of Financial News Network, from September, 1985, to June, 1989, before leaving 
for KABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
However, "Monday Night Live" will include several elements "Time Out For 
Trivia" did not, including live remotes from players' homes and bars. 
</P>
<P>
"If (linebacker) Kevin Greene had a big day for the Rams the day the before, 
we'll talk with him and then have a question about him," Donoho said. "The next 
segment might be a bar segment, followed by a baseball segment. 
</P>
<P>
"The common thread will be trivia and winning prizes while getting information 
by talking with athletes in a loose, live and spontaneous manner." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, whose department will oversee "Monday Night Live," has no qualms about 
broadcasting a telephone call-in show on the visual medium of television. 
</P>
<P>
"I was involved with 'The Tom Snyder Show' (which ran on KABC-TV from February 
to September, 1986, and was replaced by 'The Oprah Winfrey Show'), which had 
pretty decent ratings and was pretty successful for what it was," Bell said. "A 
show like this depends on the host, and we certainly know that Todd has had a 
great deal of success with the format."

GRAND ROBINSON GARDENS HARK BACK TO EARLY 1900S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virginia Robinson had the kind of gardens you or I might have, if only we owned 
6.2 acres in the heart of Beverly Hills. Private, eclectic, personal and 
comfortable; a little of this and that, all surrounding a rambling old home 
that still looks as if she could walk in at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
Now managed by the Los Angeles County Department of Arboreta, the Robinson 
Gardens are a precious bit of history preserved for the public. Most of the 
grand Los Angeles gardens from the early 1900s are long gone -- actor Harold 
Lloyd had a particularly beautiful estate that was subdivided years ago -- but 
you can still see how the wealthy lived in turn-of-the-century Beverly Hills by 
visiting the landscaped grounds of Harry and Virginia Robinson's home. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's father, Nathaniel Dryden, the architect of the Brand Library in 
Glendale, designed the 6,000-square-foot residence and began construction in 
1908, about the time his daughter married the scion of the Robinson's 
department store clan. The deed read: "The first residence in Beverly Hills"; 
Virginia Robinson was to recall years later that the fledgling community then 
consisted only of barley fields and one real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
The young couple traveled the world, bringing back not only the usual souvenirs 
but also a love for the classical gardens of Italy, France and England. The 
terraced grounds around their home reflect these dramatically different tones 
-- the main lawn is formal, symmetrical and Italianate with its cypress trees 
and ornate pool house; a beautiful rose garden on another terrace is far less 
organized and more English in feel. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Robinson died in 1932 but the gregarious Virginia was to live on the 
estate until her death just weeks shy of her 100th birthday in 1977. Having no 
children, she bequeathed the property to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens are supervised by John R. Copeland, who designs and plans all 
plantings and additions to the facility. In addition to restoring and 
preserving the original gardens, part of the county's emphasis is to use the 
frost-free gardens to grow experimental plants and to test unusual flowers and 
shrubs. A visitor gets the benefit of both worlds -- ideas for home gardens 
from the old and the new. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Eager Experimenter 
</P>
<P>
And experimenting would have suited Virginia Robinson just fine, according to 
Copeland. She sought out exotic plants for her home from the earliest days. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see 12 or so huge specimen trees that were really quite rare when they 
were planted, including what is now the largest monkey hand tree in 
California," Copeland says. 
</P>
<P>
A gorgeous pewter-colored ear pod tree (a native of Jamaica named for its 
distinctively shaped seed pods) towers 100 feet above the rose garden. Not long 
ago, Copeland found a 1919 invoice for the tree -- Virginia Robinson had bought 
it as a seedling for 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
A semitropical area of the garden is home to what Copeland says is the largest 
stand of King Palms outside of Australia. The trees are so tall that they've 
created their own microclimate under their vast canopy; the area is typically 
10 degrees cooler than the surrounding gardens, and lush shade-loving plants 
flourish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beauty and Fragrance 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Southern magnolias abound and their more unusual cousins are 
planted near the gardens' fragrance terrace. This area provides the weekend 
gardener with ideas for plants that not only are beautiful but also smell 
delightful -- waxy-blossomed stephanotis flowers cover a fence, an exotic 
gardenia the size of a tree fills a central area and citrus trees add their 
sharp aroma to the air. 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas come from the borders that Copeland has designed. You'll see a 
seasonal mixture of flowering plants in whimsical tangles of colors and 
textures. He has blended Old World lavender and cosmos with bright and cheerful 
annuals; with a little skillful downsizing of scale, you could plant any and 
all of the varieties in your own yard. 
</P>
<P>
The springtime treats in the Robinson Gardens are the azaleas; camellias were a 
favorite of Mrs. Robinson's and they abound. (She even had a camellia named 
after her -- the Virginia Robinson camellia has vivid pink flowers 3 inches in 
diameter, and dozens of the shrubs bloom at the gardens beginning in late 
January.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping the Secret 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Robinson Gardens may well feel they've found their own secret 
garden -- one of the compromises the county has had to make with the neighbors 
in this exclusive residential area is that it will only open on weekdays to 
keep parking and traffic problems down; the county also doesn't publicize the 
gardens' address. 
</P>
<P>
If you're interested in making your way up Crescent Drive to as pretty a spot 
as you'll see in Southern California, call (213) 276-4823 to get specific 
information. Tours are by appointment only Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays 
at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.; on Friday, tours are at 10 a.m. Docents lead the 1 
1/2-hour tours, which cover most of the garden and the home. Wear comfortable 
shoes and be prepared to walk about a third of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults and $2.25 for seniors 62 and older and students with 
ID. The tour is not appropriate for children under about 5.

<P>
2 MILLION NEW DEVOTEES -- MANY OF THEM WOMEN AND CHILDREN -- TOOK UP GOLF LAST 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"I used to think that if I had enough time to chase after a little white ball, 
something was very wrong with my career," said James E. Blancarte, a Westside 
attorney. "And the idea of wearing Purina checkerboard-square pants was totally 
unacceptable to me." 
</P>
<P>
But when a close friend bought a house at a country club, the temptation to 
join him on the course was too great. Blancarte took a series of 10 lessons, 
and by the fifth one, he was hooked with this new slice of life. He bought 
three beginner clubs and invested in more lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Blancarte, with a cadre of golf buddies, tees off two or three times a 
week, usually before 6 a.m. so they can get in a full nine holes before work. 
</P>
<P>
Blancarte is like many of the 2 million-plus new golfers nationwide who took up 
the game last year. And, unlike the outdated stereotype of wealthy male 
retirees in their alpaca sweaters puttering leisurely around the course, many 
of these new golfers are dynamic, intense individuals, who are actively 
committed to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Golf's image is definitely changing, according to Kit Bradshaw of the National 
Golf Foundation, who says it's one of the fastest growing sports in the 
country, with 50% of its devotees in their 20s and 30s. Women make up about 41% 
of the new golfers (more than 900,000 in 1988 alone), bringing their influence 
and buying power to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the National Sporting Goods Assn. says equipment sales alone reached 
more than $960 million in 1988; clothing and shoe sales exceeded $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
And with more than 23 million golfers nationwide, the golf foundation projects 
the numbers will be between 30 and 40 million by the turn of the century. New 
golfers are coming from all walks of life. In addition to women and young men, 
golf is becoming a big family sport, a sport for couples to play together and a 
sport for children. It's not uncommon to see 7- and 8-year-old junior golfers 
clad in fluorescent-colored surfer shorts practicing their full swings. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the game take it up for a variety of reasons: to play with family 
and friends, to enjoy the outdoors, to add another sport to their repertoire of 
activities, and to relax. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, everybody's talking about stress. I believe golf is the greatest 
panacea known to the human race," said Tom Barber, PGA golf professional and 
the Griffith Park golf course concessionaire for almost 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get out on the third or fourth hole, there are no telephones, no one 
to bother you. You don't have to have anyone to play with. It's you and nature 
and the ball and the hole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barber sees the greatest increase in interest coming from women. He believes 
the LPGA Tour is largely responsible and credits their teaching programs with 
bringing more women professionals and juniors into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is on a tremendous threshold of learning," he said. "It's becoming much 
better taught, with more emphasis on trusting your innate characteristics. A 
good teacher is someone who can make you relax and bring out more than you 
thought you were capable of." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the emphasis on teaching, many opportunities now exist for people to 
go through introductory schools, such as the one at Griffith Park, where 
would-be golfers learn enough of the fundamentals to get out on the course. 
</P>
<P>
A series of six group lessons with a free private lesson thrown in, (with all 
equipment provided) will cost $60 at Griffith Park. Deborah Winters, 37, and 
Shelly Case, 25, are two friends who decided to take lessons, partly so they 
could play with their husbands, partly as a girls' night out. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is very into golf," said Case, whose husband has been playing for 
years and has a handicap of 2. "Everyone in his family plays, and I've always 
been left out. He tried to teach me, but it's kind of like wallpapering. It's 
not something you do with your spouse. He expects me to be Nancy Lopez in an 
hour, and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
When Case moved to Los Angeles from Denver last year, she decided that there 
were so many year-round courses that it was time to learn. "I told my husband 
after the first class that he wasn't to talk to me about the game for six 
weeks. I'm only supposed to listen to my teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Al Crawford, the golf pro who teaches Case and Winters, is an example of those 
changes in teaching methods. To hear his students tell it, he doesn't expect 
them to be Jack Nicklaus. He makes the game simple and fun. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes at it from a very simple point of view, called target golf," Case 
said. "Instead of giving us all the little things that you have to do before 
you even get to hit the ball, he just says, 'There's nothing magic about it. 
All you're trying to do is to get this little ball to go in that direction -- 
and it doesn't even have to get there in one swing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's approach embodies the advances in golf teaching. He gives his new 
students the confidence to go out and play within a relatively short time. In 
fact, Deborah Winters, an account executive who is learning so she can play 
with clients (as well as with her husband and friends), has the confidence to 
"talk" the game already. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an opportunity to meet with a client who is known to be very 
closed-mouth, even dour," Winters said. "He's a golfer. When I mentioned I was 
taking golf lessons, it opened up the conversation and put it on a completely 
different level. It turned out to be a tremendous rapport-building tool." 
</P>
<P>
While a large number of women are taking up the sport, the number of junior 
golfers (children under 18 years old) is also at an all-time high. In Southern 
California, there are six junior golf associations that sponsor competitions, 
clinics and tournaments throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford heads the junior programs at Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, Tom (Barber) and I read an article about junior golf that said 
golf was the last sport kids in high school would ever think of playing," he 
recalled. "Fishing was ahead of golf." 
</P>
<P>
The two men decided it was time to change that situation. They got permission 
from the city to start a junior golf club that consisted of 10 weeks of 
instruction, each lesson being 1 1/2 hours. Other junior (17 years old and 
younger) programs throughout Southern California also offer summer instruction, 
usually one to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are divided by skill level and are taught putting, chipping and 
pitching. Lest they act improperly on the course, they're taught golf etiquette 
-- everything from how to mark their ball to how to be polite during a fellow 
player's swing. The children participate in several "miniature golf 
tournaments," where there are obstacles like water and sand on scaled-down 
versions of regular holes. 
</P>
<P>
The program culminates at the end of summer with a parent-junior tournament. 
There is so much interest in junior golf that the LPGA offered a junior golf 
clinic to teach directors budgeting, organizing and ways to teach skills to 
squirmy, energetic tykes. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, kids are playing golf at a much earlier age," Crawford said. "When I 
started teaching, juniors were 14 to 18. Now, a lot of juniors are younger than 
10. We have a lot of 7-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earning Tokens 
</P>
<P>
Craig Feustel, a 12-year-old golfer from Glendale, is so taken with the sport 
that he works in a pro shop vacuuming, cleaning out the storage room and 
picking up baskets on the golf range so he can earn tokens for range balls. 
Feustel won first place in the parent-junior tournament in 1988 and has been so 
smitten with the sport that he putts and chips with wiffle balls in his living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"What a shame it was that when I was in high school, golf and tennis were sissy 
sports," Tom Barber says. "I don't think you'll find many people around today 
who think golf and tennis are sissy sports. Michael Jordan wants to become a 
professional golfer when he completes basketball; Jerry West has a one 
handicap; John Brodie, the former NFL quarterback, is on the senior golf tour." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that "sissy" image has changed. Sixteen-year-old Eric Wilhite, an 
avid baseball player, has been playing golf during the summer with his father, 
brother and grandfather. He's had his own set of clubs for three years and 
caddied a lot for his father and grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good sport for kids," Wilhite says. "If you really practice, 
you can become good. When you go out on the course, you're really shooting 
against yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite, along with his mother, Mary, who is a social worker, began to learn 
golf in earnest because they wanted to play with Eric's dad and older brother. 
</P>
<P>
New players aren't the only ones thronging to the links. Golfers over 50 years 
old represent only 25% of golfers, but play about 50% of the rounds. And, 
frequent golfers have increased their play 15%, bringing the number of rounds 
played from 434 million in 1987 to 487 million in 1988, according to the golf 
foundation's Bradshaw. All of that means one thing: golf courses are crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have such a demand for golf that we project we need to build more 
than one golf course a day between now and the year 2000," Bradshaw said. In 
fact, just seven of the courses operated by the L.A. City Department of 
Recreation and Parks run more than 100,000 rounds a year. "That translates into 
a lot of people," says Robert Thomas, director of communications for the 
Southern California Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"On weekends it's hard to get a starting time and the speed of play is slower 
than most people would like," Thomas says. "Five hours isn't unusual -- but 
that's just a fact of life of having that many people on the golf course." 
</P>
<P>
To golfers such as Jim Blancarte, such inconveniences are all but ignored. They 
are hooked by the challenge of mastering an exceedingly difficult game. The 
feeling of getting a good, solid tee shot brings back a rush that is 
reminiscent of the crack of a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, to Blancarte, one of the most enjoyable parts of the game has 
become shopping. He still doesn't own a pair of checkered pants, but he does 
own more pastel-colored pants and matching shirts than he ever imagined. He has 
15 different golf gloves -- one to match most every shirt -- and has collected 
30 golf hats and five Chi Chi Rodriguez-style Panama hats. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my real regret is that I waited so long to take up a sport that I find 
myself wanting to play as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal courses are open to everyone on a stand-by basis, but to make an 
advance reservation, you must have a registration card. Applications are 
available at any city golf course or you can pick one up at the Department of 
Recreation and Parks, 200 N. Main St., Room 1380, City Hall East, (213) 
485-5566. The card costs $12 for 18 months. To get a starting time up to one 
week in advance, call (213) 520-8512. For weekend starting times, you can call 
Mondays and Tuesdays, but each week one group of card holders has priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounds of golf at L.A. municipal courses vary in price, depending on the time 
and the course. Generally, for nine holes, it is $5.25 weekdays and $7.25 
weekends; for 18 holes you'll pay $9.50 for weekdays and $13.50 for weekends.

<P>
Ron Argo's feeling good. Ten years in the no-man's-land of self-doubt and fear 
that go with writing a first novel are behind him now. 
</P>
<P>
Argo's book, "Year of the Monkey," was released in hardcover last month by 
Simon &amp; Schuster. Good notices already are appearing in trade journals. 
Publishers Weekly called it "compelling reading that delivers an important 
piece of the Vietnam puzzle," but also "brooding and unrelieved by optimism or 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Asahina, Simon &amp; Schuster vice president and senior editor, who took a 
chance on the first book by the San Diego novelist, said, "He has a real 
writer's voice, and that's recognizable on the first page. The book has 
wonderful texture. It's clearly written by someone who knew what he was talking 
about, who had been there and observed with a keen eye the details of Army 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The novel focuses on the relationship between Russell Payne, a reporter, like 
Argo was, in an Army public information office in Vietnam, and Willingham, a 
fighting Green Beret transferred, under mysterious circumstances, into Payne's 
relatively calm division. 
</P>
<P>
Payne and Willingham become friends, but things get complicated when Payne's 
superiors ask him to secretly investigate his new buddy. They believe 
Willingham's former commanding officer to be guilty of 
</P>
<P>
serious corruption. And they want Payne to find out what Willingham knows about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Argo is well aware of the many other books and movies about Vietnam, but thinks 
his approach is a fresh one. 
</P>
<P>
"The early Vietnam books were grunt stories," he says, mentioning "Fields of 
Fire" by James Webb and "Close Quarters" by Larry Heinemann. "They were random 
tales of men in combat without much story line. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an idea that there was a lot of suffering on the side of the 
non-combatant." Even without fighting, soldiers went through hell, according to 
Argo, saying they were "psychologically removed from life, love and family. And 
half of the enlisted men in Vietnam were there against their wills. They had a 
split feeling of duty and allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
"Allegiance is an important word in the book. Payne is from Texarkana, on the 
border of Texas and Arkansas. He's a man of split allegiance. He's from 
Arkansas, but he wants to be considered a Texan. That's the duality and 
psychological ambiguity of the non-combatant." 
</P>
<P>
As for Argo, he never wanted to go to Vietnam. Several attempts at getting a 
student deferment delayed his induction. But, in 1969, his luck ran out, and he 
was drafted at the age of 25. Fortunately, he landed a job as a wordsmith, 
first as a clerk/typist, then as an Army reporter, which kept him out of 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much action did Argo see? "I don't have a Purple Heart, let's put it 
that way. I saw some death, though." 
</P>
<P>
Back from Vietnam, he took his first classes in creative writing as an 
undergraduate at the University of Arizona. His first short stories were set in 
'50s and '60s Alabama and Georgia, where Argo grew up. After college, he worked 
for newspapers including The Sentinel in San Diego. While there, he won an 
award from Sigma Delta Chi, the professional journalism society, for a series 
he wrote on animal overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, he decided he wasn't a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I never got to finish stories adequately. I always liked general human 
interest stories more than hard news. And I like making my own deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, with neither his journalism career nor his first marriage working out, 
Argo turned his attention to fiction. He started what became "Year of the 
Monkey" while in the graduate program in literature at San Diego State 
University. (Argo later did most of the work toward a master of fine arts 
degree from the University of Arizona.) 
</P>
<P>
The earliest version of the novel was Argo's master's thesis at San Diego 
State, finished in 1980. At the time, he was confident the 160-page manuscript 
could sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I submitted 46 query letters to literary agents around the country. It was a 
high-powered letter: 'You're gonna buy this sucker, and it's gonna make big 
bucks.' I got 18 responses asking to see the manuscript. Out of those, nine 
wanted to represent the book." 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, he had selected Jane Gelfman, based in New York City, as his agent. 
But, if having an agent and getting such positive feedback launched his ego, 
Argo was about to experience the real life of a writer. It took another six 
years before he wrote the version of the book that sold. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, he says he actually wrote three books. The first was too 
ambitious, an attempt to follow Payne before, during and after the war. The 
second was in "the wrong voice, too abstract," Argo said, comparing portions of 
it with Joseph Heller's "Catch 22." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he settled on a third-person narrative, describing Payne and his 
experiences with little of the introspective spaciness that made the earlier 
draft hard to follow. His 160-page thesis became a detailed, 600-page 
manuscript with many subplots. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, his agent submitted copies to a few publishers, and all had similar 
reactions: the story started too slowly, and it was hard to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Argo clarified the plot. And, at the suggestion of Asahina, he reworked his 
final chapter and moved it to the front of the book. In the new first chapter, 
Payne is in prison for Willingham's murder. After hooking the reader, Argo 
spends the rest of the book telling the story of how Payne got there. 
</P>
<P>
"The first house we submitted it to bought it in 1987," he says. Then came 
three more rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
"It was solitary, lonely, painful work." 
</P>
<P>
Argo wouldn't disclose how much he was paid for the book, which had a first 
printing of 7,500 copies, but Asahina confirmed that a $10,000 to $15,000 
advance against royalties is about average for a first novel. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Argo's agent has made a deal for Japanese publication rights, and is 
working on other foreign markets. This month or next, paperback rights will be 
optioned, and there's always the possibility that some Hollywood producer will 
like the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll make some money," said Argo, who was financially supported by his 
second wife, Mary, while he wrote. "The story is good. I can't imagine it not 
selling well." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the book is in most major book chains, and the author has done a few 
signings, he's thinking about his next literary effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I've stepped on the banana peel of my second novel. The opening scene is a 
murder at the lighthouse on Point Loma. It's a murder mystery, so it's similar 
to "Year of the Monkey" in that respect. But my confidence is not 100% in the 
book. It could change drastically." 
</P>
<P>
Argo's in no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"Good books take time to write," he said, speaking from experience.

MCCASKILL GIVES ANGELS WIN, SCARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill looked up from his seat in the corner of the Angel clubhouse, 
noticed the crowd forming around his locker and decided it best to beat the 
onrushing horde to the punch. 
</P>
<P>
"Cramp, cramp, cramp," he announced to everyone holding note pad and pen. "It 
was only a cramp." 
</P>
<P>
You can't be too sure or too careful about the Angel pitching staff these days, 
not when McCaskill becomes the club's second starter in five days to 
prematurely exit a game due to a sudden twinge of pain. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Chuck Finley, is on the disabled list, possibly lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
And when McCaskill started to wince and hold his left side during the seventh 
inning of Friday night's 4-1 victory over the Texas Rangers at Arlington 
Stadium, it was enough to induce an entirely different kind of pain in Angel 
Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was serious or nothing," Rader deadpanned. "Just a herniated 
disk." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill had given up a 445-foot home run to Steve Buechele and was working to 
Rick Leach with a runner on base when he had to walk off the mound for a 
moment, gripping his lower left back. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann was at the mound on a 
fact-finding mission, warily eyeing his pitcher before giving him the OK to 
press ahead. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill threw two more pitches -- both balls -- and that was it. With the 
count full, Lachemann returned to the mound and brought Greg Minton with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be only a cramp," Rader said, "but I didn't want to take a 
chance. My initial reaction was not good because of the things that have 
happened to us lately. 
</P>
<P>
"You start getting jumpy. Every time I see a guy limp now, I get the 
heebie-jeebies." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill didn't exactly see his season flash before his eyes, but this is a 
pitcher who spent the last month of both the 1987 and 1988 regular seasons on 
the disabled list. So, yes, he worried for a second or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it didn't run through my mind briefly," McCaskill said. "I was 
surprised to get a brief stab of pain there. I was kind of stiff all day and 
then I got these little stabs of pain that didn't start until the seventh 
inning." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill has experienced periodic back problems this summer, which have cut 
short a few starts, but claimed this bit of discomfort was unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
"It could've been a lot of things," he said. "The change in hotel beds, us 
getting in late last night. . . . It was just a muscle twinge or whatever you 
want to call it. It just prevented me from following through on my pitches." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill (14-7) was bidding for a second consecutive shutout through six 
innings before Buechele unloaded his 14th home run of the season with one out 
in the seventh. It was a most impressive blast, too, streaking through the 
Arlington humidity and bouncing halfway up the left-field bleachers, officially 
measured at 445 feet. 
</P>
<P>
That's the third-longest home run to be hit at Arlington Stadium this year. 
Texas outfielder Pete Incaviglia reached the 450-foot mark three weeks ago and 
in May, Kansas City's Bo Jackson established a stadium record with a 461-foot 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
So, Buechele is in good company. And McCaskill helped get him there. 
</P>
<P>
Was McCaskill cramping during that at-bat as well? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," McCaskill said with a laugh. "Of course." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Angels still led, 4-1. But when the next batter, Jeff 
Kunkel, reached base on an error by shortstop Kent Anderson, followed by 
McCaskill's wavering against Leach, Rader decided it was time to preserve a 
victory that would move the Angels back within one game of Oakland in the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place Athletics lost to Kansas City, 3-1, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Minton inherited a full-count to Leach and threw one ball to walk him. But then 
he struck out Jack Daugherty and retired Fred Manrique on a fly to left, 
quelling the threat. 
</P>
<P>
After that followed two perfect innings and Minton's eighth save of the season, 
one more than his 1988 total. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored all the runs they needed in the sixth inning. For the first 
five, Texas starter Bobby Witt (10-11) had matched McCaskill, scoreless inning 
for scoreless inning, giving up three singles. 
</P>
<P>
But in the top of the seventh, he walked Devon White, Johnny Ray and Wally 
Joyner to load the bases with one out. After Chili Davis popped up for the 
second out, Witt embarked against Brian Downing, the Angels' slumping 
designated hitter, whose fifth-inning single ended a four-for-42 drought. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Witt worked the count full again before Downing lined a double 
barely inside third base, clearing the bases and giving the Angels a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
A single and a stolen base by White, coupled by a two-base error by center 
fielder Kunkel on a fly ball by Claudell Washington, accounted for the Angels' 
other run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The streaking Angels were swinging in the right direction once again. After 
losing three straight in Kansas City after winning five straight in Anaheim, 
the Angels have now won their last two. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill credited Thursday night's winning pitcher, Bert Blyleven, for paving 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
"It does take a lot of pressure off the guy who pitches after Bert when he does 
stop one of those streaks," McCaskill said. "What Bert has done this year is 
phenomenal. It's an entirely different deal -- breaking a losing streak as 
opposed to following up." 
</P>
<P>
True, but as far as the Angels are concerned, it sure beats following up Chuck 
Finley en route to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Terry Clark arrived from Edmonton Friday to fill Chuck Finley's spot on the 
roster -- and, for a while, his turn in the rotation. Clark starts tonight's 
game for the Angels, facing the Rangers' Charlie Hough. "It's nice to be up 
here and be able to pitch in a pennant race," said Clark, who was 6-6 with a 
5.07 earned-run average in three months with the 1988 Angels. "Last year, I 
came up here in July and we were already 19 games out." Clark will be pitching 
on seven days' rest, coming off an eight-inning no decision (three runs, two 
earned) last weekend against Phoenix. He claims the change in temperature will 
be more difficult to deal with than the change in the significance of this 
start. "It was 50 degrees in Edmonton," said Clark, who had watched Kirk 
McCaskill endure 95-degree weather for 6 1/3 innings. "If I have to go out 
there and give up eight runs while we get nine, that'll be fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry didn't get Finley's berth in the Angels' rotation, but he will get a 
start next week, thanks to Tuesday's makeup doubleheader in Boston. Rader said 
Friday that Petry would pitch in one of the games but was still undecided 
whether to start Jim Abbott or Bert Blyleven in the second. Abbott would be 
working on five days' rest, Blyleven on four. . . . Devon White stole three 
bases Friday night, his second three-steal night of the season. White has 39 
for the season, ranking him third in the league behind Oakland's Rickey 
Henderson and Texas' Cecil Espy. . . . Dick Schofield had the cast removed from 
his left wrist Friday, replacing it with a removable splint that will allow him 
to begin light exercises. Schofield will have the hand re-examined when the 
Angels return home, but is expected to be sidelined for at least two more 
weeks.

Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings said Friday that he has been considering buying 
the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very early on," McNall said. "I'm not totally counting it out but, at 
the same time, I would have to say it's just a possibility at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
McNall was involved in the limited partnership that established the Maverick 
franchise in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
He sold his interest in the Mavericks before he bought into the Kings in 
1986-87, when the team was owned by Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
McNall completed the purchase of the Kings in March of 1988 and since has said 
that he would never again own part of a team that he did not control. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if that meant he would be acting alone if he bought the Nets, McNall 
said: "No. That means that I would not want to be a minority partner. But there 
has been someone else interested in joining me in this, but it's a person who 
has, so far, wanted to stay in the background." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said that he learned that the Nets might be for sale through Howard 
Baldwin, former owner of the Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin mentioned that Joe Cohen had told him there might be a possibility of a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I often get asked about buying things, and 90% of the time, it's nonsense," 
McNall said. "But Cohen has credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen used to run Madison Square Garden, McNall said, and was attempting to 
line up potential buyers for the current group of Net owners "in case they 
decided to sell." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "I was impressed to see that the Nets, basically, were not losing 
money under some bad circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I said we'd talk. Cohen told me that he had another group that they were 
talking to that was interested. . . . I didn't want to get into a bidding war." 
</P>
<P>
McNall did not reveal the price tag on the team, but said it was in the range 
that other NBA franchises have been going for. That would put it at about $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
McNall paid about $20 million for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the purchase of a basketball franchise would necessitate the selling 
of his hockey franchise, McNall said "absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, McNall said, it would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The pot is in a little better shape than it used to be before the value of the 
Kings increased the way it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is for sure. My heart is with hockey. I'm not as involved 
emotionally in basketball as I am in hockey. I would have to think about it 
long and hard before I bought a basketball team or football team or baseball 
team. I would not buy any other team if I thought in any way, shape or form it 
would affect the Kings." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said that he has talked with only two of the Nets' five current owners, 
Alan Aufzein and Bernie Mann. Most of his contact has been with Cohen, who has 
"some relationship" with the current owners and was hoping to find someone to 
buy the team who would keep him involved in running it. 
</P>
<P>
As McNall came off the golf course Friday, he said that he had messages to call 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling we'll be taking another look at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNall denied rumors that he was planning to buy the Nets and move the team to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably comes from the stories that were written down there about Mannie 
Jackson's thoughts about getting an NBA team in San Diego," McNall said. "He's 
interested in getting an arena there and getting an NBA team to play in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked about that. I was asked about my interest in a financial 
partnership and so forth. But if I wasn't going to own it 100%, like the Kings, 
or at the very least, be in control, I wasn't interested." 
</P>
<P>
McNall was quoted last week in San Diego as saying: "I'm looking at teams that 
are possible to buy and move. There aren't that many available at the moment. 
The NBA is quite strong. The few teams that have been rumored for sale often 
carry with them long-term leases with the present arenas they are in. So, at 
the moment, there is not anything on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said that the Nets have a long-term lease. They are committed to the 
Meadowlands, he said, and he would want to leave the team in the New Jersey 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the league has put a lot of time, money and effort into developing the 
(New Jersey) area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that if a team is good and can provide a winner, that New 
Jersey would definitely support it. I wouldn't want to try to go against what 
the NBA would want. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an interest to the extent that I like the idea of buying something that 
is not doing very well and improving it, as you know. If I was going to buy a 
team, I would prefer to have a team in Los Angeles. Obviously. If not, in L.A. 
or San Diego, which is close to my home, then in the New York area. I go to New 
York quite often. I would have no interest in moving the team." 
</P>
<P>
McNall said that if he did buy the Nets, it would be a business transaction, 
not an emotional one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I would be a good owner for New Jersey," McNall said. "It's 
important that you pay attention to your business." 
</P>
<P>
McNall is also aware that the New York area has the kind of television and 
cable television clout that Los Angeles has. McNall is involved in the 
entertainment industry as well as in the horse-racing and breeding industry and 
in his best-known specialty, coins and antiquities. The main office of his 
Gladden Entertainment is in New York.

RAMS, VIKINGS WON'T SHOW THEIR CARDS IN EXHIBITION TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams and Minnesota Vikings, wild-card playoff opponents last winter but 
less than wild Super Bowl notions this summer, meet tonight at Anaheim Stadium 
in the 44th annual Times-Rams Charity Game. 
</P>
<P>
The game is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A showdown? Well, no, that won't come until Nov. 5, when the teams play for 
keeps at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sneak preview? Well, no, it wouldn't make sense to throw down your best 
cards in August when there's no money in the pot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you try any strategy things," Ram Coach John Robinson said this 
week. "If you've got a good idea against them, you'd hate to use it now. And 
have them ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A grudge match? Let's just say the goal posts are safe should the Rams try 
to gain a measure of revenge for last December's 28-17 playoff loss. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An exhibition game that few will remember when the teams meet again in 
three months? You're getting warmer. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game is comparable to the first round of most title fights, not the 
last. Secrecy and camouflage are the concerns; the big punches come later. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few experts are picking these teams to play in the championship 
game in January, based on past performances and potential. 
</P>
<P>
But just now, both coaches have enough problems filling out starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
Viking Coach Jerry Burns concedes this much: 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you take the top 10 teams in football, I think we're one of them. I 
think the Rams are one of them. When you get to that point, anyone can go all 
the way -- somebody gets the hot hand, or gets to believing in themselves, or a 
break in the schedule. But I don't think you can look at anybody and say here 
are the two teams that are going to go all the way to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are still without big guns. The Vikings are missing safety Joey 
Browner, receiver Anthony Carter, tight end Steve Jordan and linebacker Jesse 
Solomon -- all holdouts. The Rams are without tailback Greg Bell, tackle Robert 
Cox, tight end Damone Johnson and first-round fullback Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback controversy in Minnesota is over. At least Burns says it's 
over. Wade Wilson made the Pro Bowl in 1988 and signed a four-year, 
$4.35-million deal in the off-season. He has moved ahead of veteran Tommy 
Kramer for good, though Kramer still has the touch. 
</P>
<P>
He replaced Wilson last week against Washington and completed 13 of 23 passes 
for 245 yards and a touchdown. Wilson had connected on just four of 10 for 52 
yards and thrown two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Kramer's performance drew headlines and rekindled the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to stir one up," Burns said of his local reporters. "But 
there's none as far as I'm concerned. Wade is our No. 1 guy. Tommy is two, and 
(Rich) Gannon is three." 
</P>
<P>
The decisions Robinson faces at quarterback are all in the lower ranks. Backup 
Mark Herrmann's cracked rib sent panic waves through the organization that 
beamed clear to Atlanta, where Steve Dils was selling commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams plucked Dils from retirement and have asked him to hold a clipboard 
until Herrmann can take a deep breath. Dils may even get a few snaps tonight 
and could play the second half against Detroit next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want him to embarrass himself," Robinson said of Dils. "But I want him 
to get a taste." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Mark Schmidt, hospitalized briefly after suffering a concussion 
in practice last week, will be out an estimated eight weeks with a herniated 
disk. . . . Viking defensive tackle Keith Millard makes his first appearance of 
the season tonight after returning from an ankle injury. . . . As of Friday, 
there were 54 holdouts remaining in the league, including six first-round picks 
and 21 Pro Bowl players. Only four teams -- Buffalo, Chicago, Pittsburgh and 
Washington -- had all their players in camp. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Viking defensive ends Doug Martin and Curtis Greer will miss 
tonight's game with knee injuries. Guard Randy Rasmussen is out with a back 
injury. . . . For the Rams, Pro Bowl left guard Tom Newberry and receiver Aaron 
Cox make their first appearances after returning from hamstring injuries. . . . 
Ram starters will play into the third quarter tonight. . . . Guard Duval Love, 
who signed Friday, will be in uniform and may play a little.

Dave Chapin of Newport Beach, the second-place finisher in the 1988 Soling 
Class Olympic sailing trials in San Diego, was disqualified and suspended last 
year after testing positive for a banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
The only official announcement of the positive testing was a brief item in the 
current monthly issue of American Sailor magazine, the official publication of 
the United States Yacht Racing Union. The test had been administered under the 
guidelines of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Chapin, skippering the three-man 
boat, was runner-up in the trials to John Kostecki of San Francisco, who later 
won the silver medal at Pusan, South Korea.

Swedish hockey star Mikael Lindholm could be suspended for life and sued for 
breach of contract if he decides to continue to play with the Kings, it was 
reported in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Lindholm, 24, who has played two years for Brynas and was under contract with 
the Swedish Elite League club, signed a two-year contract with the Kings 
earlier this summer, although the June 30 deadline for transfers between Sweden 
and the National Hockey League had passed.

Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's 
medical commission, said that a new procedure for testing for banned substances 
has turned up 50 positives for anabolic steroids from 1,110 samples taken at 
the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to detect the name of the drug that has been used," de Merode 
told the New York Times Friday as IOC officials gathered in San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, for their annual meeting. "But we believe with this system we are able to 
prove that athletes have taken anabolic steroids." 
</P>
<P>
The identities of those who tested positive are not known because the documents 
matching the control numbers of urine samples and the athletes' names were 
destroyed after the Games, as is customary. 
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, where all medalists and others picked at random were tested, only 10 
athletes tested positive for illegal substances, including Canadian sprinter 
Ben Johnson, who was stripped of the gold medal after winning the 100-meter 
dash. 
</P>
<P>
The test that produced the new results was conducted at the University of 
Cologne in West Germany by Dr. Manfred Donike, a member of the medical 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
De Merode termed the test "only scientific research, nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
It is common practice for international laboratories to retain samples 
collected at competitions and freeze them for later use. It helps officials 
refine their testing procedures.

ZARAGOZA IS MORE THAN MERE MORSEL AMID THE ALPHABET SOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Earl Gustkey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last time we checked, the alphabet-soup guys who run professional boxing from 
three different directions were listing 46 "world" champions in 51 weight 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
They can agree on only one champion, Mike Tyson. Three other boxers are 
recognized as champions by two governing bodies, but in 13 weight classes, each 
of the three organizations -- the World Boxing Assn., the World Boxing Council 
and the International Boxing Federation -- has its own champion. 
</P>
<P>
It's so bad that a boxing follower almost needs a home computer to keep track 
of the champions and contenders. After all, how many know, for example, that 
Napa Katwanchai is the WBC's strawweight (105 pounds or less) champion? Or that 
Katwanchai is from Thailand? 
</P>
<P>
And if you can identify Kaosai Galaxi as the WBA junior-bantamweight champion, 
you're world class. 
</P>
<P>
Point is, with boxing being so poorly served by three feuding governing bodies, 
it's easy to overlook an outstanding champion today, such as Daniel Zaragoza of 
Mexico City, who will defend the WBC (or is it the IBF?) super-bantamweight 
championship at the Forum Thursday night against Frankie Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
One night in June, Zaragoza took on Southland favorite Paul Banke at the Forum 
and showed a crowd of 4,500 how a champion fights. 
</P>
<P>
Banke is dangerous with his hook, but he is often off balance when he misses. 
He got caught twice in the first round by Zaragoza, and Zaragoza's manager, 
Rafael Mendoza, says today that Zaragoza won that fight in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the video of that first round," he said. "Daniel caught him twice on 
the inside with short shots to the head, and Banke never really got into a 
rhythm after that." 
</P>
<P>
But to many that night, it seemed that Zaragoza saved his championship late, 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
While Banke was taking shots from both inside and long range, Zaragoza was 
steady and cool. Steady? He was a rock -- even in the ninth, when Banke floored 
him with a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, trailing on nearly everyone's scorecard, seemed to turn the fight around 
early in the 10th. Finally, he was throwing bombs, and connecting. Then 
Zaragoza dug a short right hand to Banke's ribs and the challenger faltered. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Zaragoza's championship was on the line. He scored with a 
combination of his own, and Banke backed off. Zaragoza finished the 10th 
strongly. And he won the 11th and 12th rounds, too. 
</P>
<P>
That night, at the end, it was so clear what had happened. A champion in 
distress had fought like a champion. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappily, the alphabet-soup guys have cluttered up boxing so much it's too 
easy to lose sight of a champion such as Daniel Zaragoza. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Magana has been doing Spanish-language publicity work for Southern 
California boxing shows for more than 50 years. Herbert Hoover was president 
when Magana started at the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, he says, promoter Don King asked him to help him with the Los 
Angeles Spanish-speaking media for his Julio Cesar Chavez-Roger Mayweather 
fight at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I wanted $500 a week, and he agreed," Magana said. "I worked on the 
fight for a month. In one stretch, I worked 22 days in a row. After the fight, 
he sent me a check for $500 and two tickets in the cheap seats. When I called 
to complain, he told me I'd agreed to do it for $500 total. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him there were times during the Depression when I made $100 a week, but 
that I'd be a lunatic to offer to work for that today. I turn 80 next year -- I 
don't need this." 
</P>
<P>
Al Braverman, a spokesman for King, denied Friday that Magana had been stiffed. 
</P>
<P>
"No such agreement ($500 a week) with Magana was ever made," he said. "Don King 
has never stiffed anyone who ever work for him, ever." 
</P>
<P>
Oh? What about Tim Witherspoon, the heavyweight who fought Frank Bruno in 
London for, he said, a promised $900,000 from King and later said he wound up 
with $90,000? 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Madison Square Garden's twice-monthly boxing shows are going on the road. The 
Garden's Felt Forum, hotbed of New York City boxing since 1969, is closing for 
remodeling for two years. In the interim, the Garden will stage its shows at 
the Beacon Theater in New York, in Upstate New York and Atlantic City. . . . 
Michael Dokes got in the last Felt Forum knockout before the closing, stopping 
Wesley Watson in the third round Thursday night. Dokes' manager, Marty Cohen, 
met in New York with Don King Wednesday, but the two are said to be $2 million 
apart over what Dokes should earn for a Mike Tyson fight. King, meanwhile, said 
Friday that two promotional groups in Toronto and one in Edmonton want to 
promote a Tyson fight against Canadian Razor Ruddock. 
</P>
<P>
Trump Plaza in Atlantic City says it has the Evander Holyfield-Alex Stewart 
heavyweight match but hasn't picked a date yet. Stewart, like Holyfield, is 
unbeaten but has stopped all 24 of his opponents. . . . The Normandie 
Recreation Center in Los Angeles, 1550 S. Normandie, presents a 10-bout amateur 
boxing show Sunday at 2 p.m. NBC's Sunday show: welterweights Buddy McGirt and 
Gary Jacobs, replacing Edwin Rosario-Lupe Suarez, after Rosario suffered a hand 
injury in training. . . . The United States' amateur team for the World 
Championships in Moscow, Sept. 17-Oct. 2, is training at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz. . 
. . Official paid attendance for the Michael Nunn-Iran Barkley fight at Reno's 
11,000-seat Lawlor Events Center Aug. 14 was 5,453. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Park Hilton Hotel will have an invitational amateur boxing show 
Sept. 1-3. . . . Johnny Flores, 73, longtime Southland amateur boxing guru, has 
been inducted into the national Golden Gloves Hall of Fame. . . . Roy Jones, 
the middleweight thought by many to have been robbed of a gold medal at the 
Seoul Olympic Games, tries to move his pro record to 3-0 on an NBC show Sept. 
3. . . . Gilberto Roman of Mexico defends his WBC super-flyweight championship 
at the Forum Sept. 12 against Santos Laciar of Argentina. . . . Hard-hitting 
unbeaten flyweight Michael Carbajal, who has knocked out his last two 
opponents, goes next in Tucson Sept. 5.

After taking a perfect record into the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. final 
four last season, UCLA's women's volleyball team was somewhat humbled when it 
lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But, says Coach Andy Banachowski, that may prove helpful this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they had such a tremendous year (34-0 before losing to Texas) and 
came away with a totally disappointing feeling at the end of the year," he 
said. "So I don't think we're going to get too keyed up, maybe like we did last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, added Banachowski, this season figures to start out differently. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people asked me, 'Don't you wish you'd have lost (a game) early on?' 
" he said, alluding to possible overconfidence. "Well, we may do that. . . . 
It's part of the game plan this year." 
</P>
<P>
Banachowski, in his 23rd year as coach of the Bruins, was joking and went so 
far as to call this team his deepest and most powerful yet. But, he noted, with 
the absence of setter Ann Boyer, who graduated after last season, "It's going 
to be tough at first." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bruins, who will begin play Wednesday at the All Cal Tournament at 
UCLA's Wooden Center, are the overwhelming choice as the nation's top team, 
according to a poll of Division I coaches. Stanford was second, followed by 
Hawaii and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer is the only one of last season's starters missing from the lineup, which 
features 10 veterans, including All-American middle blockers Daiva Tomkus and 
Elaine Youngs. But Boyer's absence is expected to have a negative impact on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Her replacement -- either Traci Broadway or Jennifer Gratteau -- had limited 
playing time last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the game experience," Banachowski said. "That's what's lacking 
and I think because of that we're going to be a little ragged at first." 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus, a two-time All-American and last year's Pacific 10 Conference player of 
the year, played this summer with the United States national B team, and, along 
with Youngs, will anchor the Bruins' middle. Other returning players include 
outside hitters Samantha Shaver and Jenny Crocker, and Jenny Evans and Laurie 
Jones, who split playing time last year. Freshman recruits Natalie Williams and 
Mia Lambert figure to make Banachowski's choice at finding the right 
combination a difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
Also figuring to be competitive nationally is Cal State Long Beach, ranked 
fifth in the poll. The 49ers, coached by Brian Gimmillaro and led by Tara 
Cross, player of the year in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., were 26-7 
last season, losing to Pacific in the Northwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Cross, 5-11, a left-side hitter who also played with the national B team, is 
considered by Gimmillaro "the best all-around player in the country," and with 
1,988 kills in her career, best in the Big West Conference, she could break the 
NCAA record 2,188. 
</P>
<P>
Cross and setter Sheri Sanders, who led the nation in assists with an average 
of 14.02 a game, will team largely with Cheryl Stephens, Trisonya Thompson -- a 
transfer from USC -- Vicki Pullins, Merrilee Conway and Sherri Thormahlen. 
</P>
<P>
USC, meanwhile, is ranked 16th, but the Trojans have a new coach in Lisa Love, 
from Texas Arlington, a school that in seven years never lost a Southland 
Conference match. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a nice nucleus of leadership and talent," she said of the Trojans, who 
have four returning starters, two seniors and two juniors. "We're starting in 
the top 20 and hopefully we can climb somewhat."

GROSSMAN READY TO START EARNING PAY; 
</P>
<P>
BUT HOW MUCH HE'LL MAKE WORKING FOR CHARGERS IS DISPUTED 
</P>

<P>
After a 34-day holdout, free-spirited rookie Burt Grossman was just happy to be 
at the Friday press conference in which the Chargers announced they had signed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He even joked about his contract, saying, "I've got to check my account and see 
if it's as much as I made at Pitt. If it is, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
"Just kidding," he added after a short pause. 
</P>
<P>
But just who was kidding whom about how much money Grossman will get from the 
Chargers was still unclear at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
There was more than one discrepancy between the dollar numbers reported by the 
Chargers to the NFL and the numbers being discussed by Grossman sources. 
</P>
<P>
According to an agent for another 1989 No. 1 draft pick -- who said he obtained 
his figures through the NFL Management Council, which gets its information 
directly from the league -- Grossman's contract is worth $2.885 million over 
five years, the fifth being an option year. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's agent, Cleveland attorney Robert Jackson, wouldn't speak on the 
record about how much the Chargers will pay. But he disputed the agent's 
Management Council numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Grossman contended his contract was worth $3.01 million over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
So, you ask, what's $125,000 among friends? Grossman, the Chargers' probable 
starter at right end and the first defensive lineman picked in the draft, is 
going to be a rich man either way. 
</P>
<P>
True enough. But this summer, Grossman made a show of firing agent Richard 
Woods and hiring Jackson. Jackson, a former attorney for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission during the Kennedy Administration, had never represented a 
first-round NFL player before Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the option year of Grossman's contract, Jackson said 
Grossman's base salary would be 110% of the fourth year if there were no 
renegotiation. But according to Plan B adopted by the owners, any option year 
of a contract in which the player will earn more than $250,000 is only worth 
100% of the previous year's base salary. 
</P>
<P>
"Grossman got clobbered," said the other agent. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Brandt, the Cowboys' former vice-president of personnel development, 
assisted Jackson in the negotiations with the Chargers that lasted virtually 
around the clock Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
What is undisputed is Grossman's signing bonus ($950,000) and his base salaries 
for 1989 ($250,000) and 1990 ($300,000). Grossman also will receive roster 
bonuses (deferred one year) of $50,000 each of his first two years. 
</P>
<P>
Depending upon whom you believe, he will make either $350,000 or $375,000 in 
base salary in 1991 and either $400,000 or $450,000 in 1992. His roster bonuses 
in 1991 and 1992 are $30,000. He will get $75,000 ($30,000 deferred) in bonuses 
for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
There were two triggers for Grossman's arrival. First were the recent signings 
of Steeler running back Tim Worley and Phoenix linebacker Eric Hill. Worley, 
Grossman and Hill were the seventh, eighth and 10th players selected in the 
first round last spring. When Jackson and the Chargers found out what Worley 
and Hill had received, it was easier to agree on what Grossman was worth. 
</P>
<P>
Second, there was the performance of the Charger defense in three exhibition 
games. Defensive coordinator Ron Lynn's unit has allowed just one long 
touchdown drive during that period. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I had to sign quick," Grossman said. "I didn't have any holding 
ground any more. My bargaining chips were starting to fall away." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, praised 
Jackson's negotiating style and issued a challenge to Grossman based on 
Grossman's track record for public self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Burt Grossman is one player I believe fully understands that the easiest thing 
he is going to do over the course of his career here is to put his name on the 
line," Ortmayer said. "Now he's going to get tested for what's real. And that's 
to prove that he can help make this football team win." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning was extremely upset with the official who called Dan 
Rosado for holding late in the fourth quarter of his team's 17-14 loss to the 
defending world champion 49ers Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty stopped a Charger drive in San Francisco territory and forced them 
to attempt a 53-yard field goal that fell short. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Henning said he still wasn't happy with the call but would not 
file a formal complaint with the league. The NFL asks for reports from its head 
coaches on officiating crews after each game. 
</P>
<P>
"I ceased filing reports, personally, about four years ago," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
He prefers, he said, to have an occasional conversation with Jack Reader, the 
league's assistant supervisor of officials. One of Henning's assistants files 
the weekly report. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that (file reports) the way I did at one time because I don't see 
much fruition there," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he would prefer the league to change its approach on officiating. 
Specifically, he said, he wishes officials would only call the penalties that 
are obvious. It would help speed up the game and make for more consistency 
between different officiating crews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's a question, and it's close, I don't think they should ever throw 
the flag," Henning said. "If you want to look, you can probably find some 
misdoings on every play. I'd like to see those guys (the officials) be 
somewhere between 95 and 100% (correct). If you only pull the flag when you're 
sure, then you're going to have a high percentage. If I was to grade them on 
the ones they don't see, there's not one in the league who will make 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the holding call on Rosado that negated a first down run by Marion 
Butts didn't show up on the Chargers' game films. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Bear Coach Mike Ditka and his quarterback, Jim McMahon, differed on 
what McMahon should do when McMahon's receivers were covered and the defense 
flushed him out of the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon preferred to run for as many yards as he could, and that was one reason 
he was injured so often. Ditka preferred McMahon to slide in front of defenders 
rather than take a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
In his one rush against the 49ers Wednesday, McMahon chose to slide. The next 
day, Henning said he and McMahon hadn't discussed the subject yet. 
</P>
<P>
When they do? 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer," Henning said, "for him to do things in this order: Complete 
the pass; throw the ball on the margin of error side; if the pocket opens up 
inside, escape inside; if the pocket opens up outside, escape outside, and 
again complete the pass or throw it on the margin of error side or throw it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"And if he decides to take it upfield, to be prudent. I mean if you need 25 
yards and you're being headed at nine, being prudent would be to slide. If you 
need nine yards, and you're being headed at eight, being prudent would not be 
to slide." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, said he had not 
heard from running back Gary Anderson's agent Friday. On Thursday, Ortmayer 
countered an Aug. 14 contract proposal from Peter Johnson, who represents 
Anderson, one of two unsigned Charger free agents remaining. The other is 
defensive lineman Joe Phillips. Ortmayer said there was nothing new to report 
on him either. . . . The Charger receivers already have noticed the difference 
between the "touch" passes of Jim McMahon and the tight spirals thrown by 
rookie Billy Joe Tolliver. "McMahon and David Archer have a softer ball," said 
rookie Dana Brinson. "Billy Joe's is, like, very hard."

JAMES LIFTS PADRES WITH HOMER IN 11TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A real, live pennant race came to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Friday night, 
just like the ones you hope for each year as August begins fading into 
September. 
</P>
<P>
It had a screaming manager, a balking pitcher and a protesting team. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Padres was that they weren't the team in the pennant race. 
The good part for them was that it was the New York Mets who most of the 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
By evening's end, the Padres were 5-3 winners in 11 innings in front of 32,150 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
The winning runs came with two out in the bottom of the 11th when Chris James 
hit a Randy Myers pitch into the left field seats. The ball was hit so hard 
that Met left fielder Kevin McReynolds never moved. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark, who had walked, was on first. 
</P>
<P>
"You just got to be ready to hit when you get up against Myers," he said. "He's 
not going to let you pick away." 
</P>
<P>
It was James' 12th homer of the season -- his 10th since coming to San Diego. 
And it was the exclamation point on an eventful night. 
</P>
<P>
It came after the Mets protested the game, which was after Met Manager Davey 
Johnson was ejected, which was after . . . 
</P>
<P>
It started in the sixth. The Mets were clinging to a 1-0 lead, knowing that the 
Chicago Cubs had already beaten Atlanta Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were now two games behind the first-place Cubs in the NL East and, 
with a nine-game West Coast swing looming, wanted to get started in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Their trouble started after Ed Whitson's lead-off double in the sixth. Met 
starter Sid Fernandez threw to Dave Magadan at first on an appeal play, 
claiming Whitson missed first. But first base umpire Jerry Crawford called a 
balk, sending Whitson to third. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was flustered. Up stepped Bip Roberts. Out to the mound went catcher 
Mackey Sasser. After Sasser returned to his position, Davey Johnson came 
running out of the dugout to talk with Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Their advice didn't do much good. Roberts sent a one-and-one pitch into the 
left field seats to make it 2-1, and three pitches later, Roberto Alomar 
homered to left to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was Alomar's first homer since June 5 and the first time since last Sept. 12 
that the Padres had hit back-to-back home runs. 
</P>
<P>
None of that did much for the Mets' attitudes. Davey Johnson left the dugout 
again, this time to discuss the situation with the umpires. But Johnson talked 
more than he listened and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Met third baseman Howard Johnson wanted to deliver a few 
soothing words to Fernandez, but third base umpire Bill Hohn, wanting to speed 
up the game, wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the Mets protested the game. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later, they tied it. Gregg Jefferies led off with a single, and 
after Whitson got Juan Samuel to pop out, Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson 
called for left-handed Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The move seemed logical. First, Davis has 31 saves. Second, batter Howard 
Johnson had 30 homers at that point -- 25 against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes in baseball, logic doesn't matter. Johnson picked out Davis' 
fourth pitch -- the count was one-and-two -- and put it over the left field 
fence to make it 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Davis lasted 2 2/3 innings and was charged with one run on three hits. He gave 
way in the 11th to Greg Harris, who earned the victory to improve to 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, some weird things were happening. 
</P>
<P>
There was Whitson on the mound, in the middle of a career year. Third in the 
National League in victories -- a career-high 15 -- eighth in earned run 
average and tenth in innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser, batting a respectable .288 but having entered this season with just 40 
hits, stepped to the plate in the second and singled to right. 
</P>
<P>
Significant? Well, at that point, Sasser was nine for nine this season against 
Whitson. The streak was broken in the fourth, when Sasser flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the statistical spectrum was Padre first baseman Clark. By 
evening's end, he was zero for 26 against the Mets this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez isn't exactly a stranger to the Padres. He pitched seven innings 
against them 11 days ago, allowing a mere six hits and two runs. But 
familiarity doesn't make it any easier to hit him. Entering Friday's game, he 
led the National League having held opponents to a .202 average. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he wasn't winning, either. He got his fifth consecutive 
no-decision Friday, giving him no decisions in seven of his past eight outings. 
</P>
<P>
For a while Friday, the Padres didn't do much damage to his stats. Fernandez 
sailed along until the sixth, allowing just two Tony Gwynn singles through five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, meanwhile, came into the game not having scored in 20 innings. 
Whitson extended that streak just one more inning before the Mets scored a run 
in the second. That came when Garry Templeton booted Kevin McReynolds' grounder 
to lead off the inning. After Whitson struck out Dave Magadan, Sasser rapped a 
single to right to move McReynolds to third. He scored on Kevin Elster's fly to 
left field. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson lasted 7 1/3 innings, allowing two runs -- one earned -- and five hits. 
He struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The field was in relatively good shape for the beginning of the Padres' 
nine-game home stand Friday after a San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium performance 
by The Who Tuesday. The only visible signs of the concert were in right field, 
where brown patches marked the turf where the stage had been . . . Tony Gwynn 
started Friday for the first time since Monday. Gwynn pinch-hit Tuesday in 
Philadelphia and was given Wednesday off to rest his aching left Achilles 
tendon and right wrist. It was his first off day this year.

ZAUN CHANGES COURSE, SIGNS WITH ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gregg Zaun, who had signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Texas 
on a baseball scholarship, reconsidered this week and signed a contract Friday 
night with the Baltimore Orioles, the team that drafted him in the 17th round 
of the amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun, 18, The Times Glendale Player of the Year, will report to the Orioles' 
instructional league team in Sarasota, Fla., on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Del Rey League catcher from St. Francis High batted .475 and drove in 
32 runs last season. He also was the starting catcher on the U. S. Junior 
National team that recently won its second consecutive Junior World 
Championship in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
When talks broke down with the Orioles at his home in Glendale Thursday night, 
Zaun was prepared to leave for Texas. "We were negotiating (Thursday) night and 
things didn't work out and they called back (Friday) morning with an offer I 
couldn't refuse," Zaun said. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun said he has been unable to contact Texas coaches to inform them of his 
decision. Zaun said he reconsidered his decision to play for the Longhorns, 
runners-up in the 1989 College World Series, when he was approached daily in 
Quebec by an Oriole scout who was staying in the same hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Zaun is a nephew of Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey and Oriole scout Paul Fryer 
said the lineage is evident in Zaun's play. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw (Zaun), I really liked him," said Fryer, who lives in 
Chatsworth. "He has what you would call intangibles. He's a very good receiver 
with a good arm. He's a leader on the field and, of course, he has bloodlines. 
He's the reincarnation of Rick Dempsey, probably more than Dempsey's son (John, 
who played for Crespi last season)." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer added Zaun is "so polished for his age" that he might be able to bypass 
the rookie league and go directly to a Class-A team.

CLU PRACTICE UNDAMPED BY UNCERTAINTY; 
</P>
<P>
SHOUP INFORMS TEAM OF HIS DISMISSAL BEFORE A TYPICAL FIRST WORKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It is probably the beginning of the end for Cal Lutheran football Coach Bob 
Shoup, but there were no apocalyptic overtones when Shoup put his squad through 
the first practice of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Practicing under a battleship-gray sky at Mount Clef Stadium on Friday morning, 
the Kingsmen gave no indication that their coach had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup was told Aug. 8 that this season, his 28th at Cal Lutheran, will be his 
last as the head football coach if school administrators get their way. He 
explained the situation to his players in a team meeting after they reported 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave a very brief summary of where we are so they don't feel like it's a big 
cloud hanging over the season," Shoup said. "I told them not to get too 
concerned over things they don't have control over." 
</P>
<P>
Although word of Shoup's dismissal had spread through the team grapevine, the 
coach noted that many of the players had still not heard the news before they 
arrived for fall practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these guys had never even seen each other," said Shoup, who welcomed 
more than 30 newcomers to the team. "I think I had more of my former players 
who were concerned about what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup has built a 182-81-6 record at Cal Lutheran, but he said he didn't give a 
"win-one-for-the-Gipper" speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically outlined everything so if they hear a rumor or pick up something 
then they can judge for themselves," Shoup said. "I feel right now that I owe 
it to them and they owe it to themselves to avoid getting caught up in a 
confusing issue." 
</P>
<P>
A squad of 69 players took part in the morning workout, and 11 more were 
waiting to take physicals. A handful of players are still trying to iron out 
academic difficulties, and Shoup said he expects the roster to eventually fill 
out to about 65 players. 
</P>
<P>
"He let us know he's not giving up on us," said Rich Toll, a senior defensive 
lineman. "How the whole team feels is that we're going to play our season and 
let the off-the-field antics work themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup betrayed little concern over his coaching future and seemed more worried 
about preparing the Kingsmen for their opener at Sonoma State on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"They should outlaw first days of practice," Shoup said after watching his team 
stumble and pant their way through two hours of drills, conditioning and 
physical testing. 
</P>
<P>
Now playing under Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
rules, the Kingsmen were not allowed to hold spring practice, and their fall 
workout schedule has been abbreviated as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have another four days of padded practice," Shoup said. 
</P>

WITH EACH NEW DAY, FORMER CLU PUNTER KENT SULLIVAN MOVES CLOSER TO AN NFL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Kent Sullivan, a former Cal Lutheran punter trying to make it with the Chicago 
Bears, almost gave up football at one point. 
</P>
<P>
As a punter at Northridge High in Middlebury, Ind., Sullivan wanted to play 
college football. He went to his high school coach for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think I can play in college?" Sullivan asked Ray Reid, the Northridge 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Reid said he wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an adult and I figured he knew what he was talking about," Sullivan 
said. "So I took his advice and decided that there wasn't much for me in 
Indiana, so I joined the Army." 
</P>
<P>
After completing basic training in 1982, Sullivan was stationed at a supply 
depot in Death Valley for three years. His duties included loading and 
unloading railroad cars. 
</P>
<P>
While in the Army, his love for football was rekindled, so he started 
practicing again at Barstow High. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Hubauer, then the Barstow football coach, took an interest in Sullivan 
after seeing him punt. 
</P>
<P>
Hubauer still remembers his first meeting with Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up to the field one afternoon and asked if I minded if he would kick," 
Hubauer recalled. "He had one ball with him and we gave him some more balls. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just kicking the daylights out of them. He was booming it. He came 
around real regular and my kicking coach worked with him." 
</P>
<P>
Hubauer thought Reid had erred in his evaluation of Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"Some coaches are just horses . . . ," Hubauer said. "Some coaches don't know 
what they're talking about. His coach obviously made a mistake with this kid 
because he's got a very strong leg. In fact, he has one of the strongest legs 
I've seen in my coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"And he has a great work ethic. I'm thrilled that I had a small part in getting 
him into college." 
</P>
<P>
After failing to interest USC, UCLA, Cal State Long Beach and Cal State 
Fullerton in Sullivan, Hubauer arranged for the kicker to attend Cal Lutheran 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more out of desperation than anything else," Sullivan said, because Cal 
Lutheran had lost Bill Turner, an All-American punter. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan made the team and averaged 40.1 yards a punt in his first three 
seasons. Disappointed with his performance, Sullivan attended a kicking camp in 
Reno before last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Pelfrey, a former National Football League punter who runs the Professional 
Kicking Service, changed Sullivan's punting mechanics at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Most college punters are just that," Pelfrey said. "They're a long way from 
being an NFL punter. Most of them don't have the consistency in their drop-back 
action and we have to clean their mechanics up to a new level." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan struggled to incorporate the changes into his punting last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They changed everything I did in my technique -- from the foot stance to the 
angle of the ball to the drop of the ball," Sullivan said. "It was like 
starting over from square one and it took me a while to integrate the changes 
into my game." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan continued to use his old technique in games while practicing the new 
style in workouts. After averaging 34 yards in the first half of the season, he 
switched to the new technique at midseason and averaged 44 yard a kick. 
</P>
<P>
"It took him half of the season to get his new technique down," said Kyle 
Tarpenning, an assistant coach at Cal Lutheran. "But once he got it down he was 
really consistent and he had good hang time on his kicks." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 6-feet and 205 pounds, also handled long-range field goals, 
converting a 52-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Cal Lutheran last spring, Sullivan, 25, dreamed of 
playing in the pros. While at Cal Lutheran, he ran errands for the Dallas 
Cowboys, who train at the Thousand Oaks campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to compare myself to the Cowboy punters so I would know where I was 
at," Sullivan said. "It was discouraging because they were always so much 
better than I was. 
</P>
<P>
"But when Dallas was in camp last season I had changed dramatically and I was 
so much better. When I compared myself to them I could see that I was really 
close to what they were doing. I figured I could play in the pros, too." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan returned to kicking school during spring break, spending three weeks 
at the camp. While he was there he met Chicago Bears special-teams coach Steve 
Kazor. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him a white lie, that I was going to be in Chicago for a wedding and I 
asked him if I could have a tryout while I was there," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy worked and Sullivan got a tryout with the Bears, who invited him to 
rookie camp along with Mike McCabe from Illinois State and Doug Robison from 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears needed a punter because Bryan Wagner, a former Cal State Northridge 
punter who spent the last two seasons in Chicago, signed a free-agent contract 
with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
After beating out McCabe and Robison, Sullivan was invited to training camp 
along with Maury Buford, a veteran punter who was released by the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sullivan has punted well in training camp and two exhibition games, it 
might take him a while to break into the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Eleven kids who attended the Professional Kicking Service are kicking in the 
NFL," Pelfrey said. "And we had 11 signed by teams this year. But most of them 
may not make it this first year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to break into the system. The head coaches don't usually look for a 
great young punter, they look for a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have got to prove that they're more consistent and have greater hang 
time. The reason most of our kids have made it is that eventually they get into 
camp and they're so dominating that they do make it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears are going to have to make a decision if they want to go with an 
older punter or a great young punter. Kent hasn't topped out. He hasn't nearly 
reached his peak. He's a very fine prospect for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like it's my job and he's got to beat me out of it," Sullivan said of 
Buford. "And I'm not going to let that happen."

KRIEGER FLOURISHES IN NEW SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Krieger has yet to win a main event as a rookie in the Sportsman division 
at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has never finished among the top five in a main event, has never 
posted the evening's top qualifying time and has never qualified for a trophy 
dash. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Krieger, who moved up from the Hobby Stock division last season -- skipping 
the Street Stock division in favor of the track's top class -- has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a bigger step than I thought," Krieger, 23, said. "But I 
wouldn't be doing it if I didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Krieger, the track's only driver to jump two divisions this season, finished 
seventh in last Saturday's 40-lap main event -- his highest finish of the 
season -- and moved to eighth in the point standings. Krieger has gained in the 
standings in each of the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Krieger, last season's Hobby Stock champion and the division's rookie 
of the year in 1987, is leading the Sportsman race for rookie of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
With 123 points, Krieger leads fellow rookie Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill by 
16. Mintey, who is 10th in the standings, has won two main events (one on a 
disqualification), but has failed to finish six times, including last week when 
he was forced out with a blown engine. 
</P>
<P>
Krieger, meanwhile, has finished all 15 mains and has placed eighth three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought at the beginning of the season that I would be the leader of 
rookie of the year," Krieger said. "I never thought I would be among the top 
10. But here I am." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy. Krieger, who lives in Reseda and works in Calabasas as an 
auto mechanic, travels five nights a week to his father's home in Palmdale to 
work on his race car. Considering time invested in travel, Krieger spends 
little time taking a wrench to his car and has scrambled to keep pace with 
track veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I used to work on the car to get it ready in a night's work and the 
rest of the time I would concentrate on making the car go faster," Krieger 
said. "Now I spend all my time getting the car ready. You literally have to 
take the car apart after every race." 
</P>
<P>
Krieger says he is "slowly going faster." Last week, he was presented with the 
track's "Hard Charger" award, presented to the driver who gains the most 
positions in a main event. Krieger passed 11 cars to finish eighth the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping I can hold him off," Krieger said of Mintey. "But he could be right 
there. They're not screwing around." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the fast lane: Dan Press of Frazier Park, a former Saugus Modified 
champion, has rebounded from a three-race slump and is rewriting the record 
books of the NASCAR All-American Challenge Series Southwest Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Press, 40, posted a tour-record sixth victory last Saturday at Carson City 
Raceway in the Coors Light/Ormsby House 100. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 of 19 events, Press remains the series leader with 1,990 points, 123 
ahead of former champion Mike Chase of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The victory revitalized Press, who had stumbled the previous three races. Twice 
Press failed to finish races because of mechanical failure. In another race, he 
was slowed by a flat tire -- the result of a faulty valve stem. Consequently, 
his points lead over Chase had dwindled from 230 to 73 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a couple of freak things happening," Press said. "That kind of 
stuff could happen to anybody. One little thing can do it to you. But we still 
have a pretty big lead." 
</P>
<P>
The tour resumes today with the Spears Manufacturing 100 at Stockton 99 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Add points: New leaders made their first appearances of the season atop the 
Saugus Sportsman and Street Stock standings. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, the track's two-time defending Sportsman champion, 
took the lead in the standings for the first time this season by virtue of a 
fourth-place finish in last Saturday's main event. Phipps, who has a 
division-high five main-event wins, is gunning for an unprecedented third 
consecutive Sportsman title and fourth in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Beckers of Sepulveda, who finished second in last Saturday's 25-lap oval 
main and won the 15-lap figure 8 main, became the fifth divisional leader this 
year. Beckers finished second last season in the Street Stock division. 
</P>
<P>
Motocross: Daniel Coe of Woodland Hills is seventh in the American Motorcycle 
Assn. Castrol 250cc points standings after finishing ninth in the Aug. 13 event 
at Sears Point International Raceway in Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Specht of Canoga Park finished 14th at Sears Point. 
</P>
<P>
Ely Schless of North Hollywood finished seventh in the Circle Bell Pro Twins 
Grand Prix class of the AMA National Championship road race at Sears Point on 
Aug. 11-13. 
</P>
<P>
Kiyoshige Watanabe of Burbank finished fifth in the Circle Bell Pro Twins 
Modified class and Chris Scott of North Hollywood finished seventh in the 
12-lap, 30-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Hames of Palmdale finished ninth in the AMA Camel Pro National 
Championship Series on Aug. 13 at Peoria Motorcycle Clubgrounds in Peoria, Ill. 
Hames finished third in the fourth heat and is 20th in the points standings 
after 11 of 17 events.

Bruce Hurst was examined Friday by the Padres' medical staff at Scripps Clinic, 
and their diagnosis matched that of Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Boston team doctor 
who examined Hurst Thursday: Hurst might have a slight tear in his groin area. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst missed seven weeks with a groin injury when he was with the Red Sox in 
1986, but said his current injury isn't as bad as the old one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's already a lot better than it was a couple of days ago," Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Manager Jack McKeon said, Hurst will miss his scheduled start 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hurst: "We'll shoot for Saturday (his next scheduled start) and see how it 
goes."

Don Schulze will replace Hurst in the starting rotation Sunday, opposing Bob 
Ojeda of the Mets. SCOTT MILLER

HOSPITAL ASKS FOR DONORS FOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to save the lives of two 17-year-old high school seniors, Brea 
Community Hospital is sponsoring a drive to find bone marrow donors who might 
be able reduce the 1-in-20,000 odds of finding a suitable match. 
</P>
<P>
Both Anissa Ayala of Walnut and Brandon Oba of Brea found out last year they 
have chronic leukemia, a fatal cancer of the blood that is progressive and 
curable only by bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, transplants are done with relatives whose blood tissue matches that 
of the patient. But because no one in their families had tissue that matched, 
the search has gone public, said Judy Brenner of Huntington Beach, a volunteer 
who is spearheading the drive in conjunction with Life-Savers Foundation, a 
Covina-based national nonprofit organization founded to recruit potential 
marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first ask someone if they want to be a bone-marrow donor, it sounds 
horrible," she said. "But when they hear what a small commitment it is, that 
it's easy to get tested, most people are willing to give up a day or two and 5% 
of their bone marrow to save someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
Brea Community Hospital, which has become involved in the teen-agers' cases as 
a community service, has scheduled a day of testing Monday for its employees 
and three days of public testing for donors beginning Sept. 17, a spokesman 
said. It is the first hospital in the country to recruit donors and pay for lab 
tests, said Dr. Rudolf L. Brutoco, a Covina pediatrician who founded 
Life-Savers last year after a nationwide search produced a donor for his wife, 
who became leukemia-free as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Tests are paid for by the hospital and Life-Savers, as well as by funds raised 
by Brenner and others. 
</P>
<P>
Test results of potential donors will be sent to a computer bank in St. Paul, 
Minn., that is run by the National Institutes of Health, Brutoco said. While 
the drive is being publicized to help the two teen-agers, people also are being 
asked to donate to any of the other 9,000 patients nationwide who are awaiting 
marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
The success rate with matched relatives is 60% to 70%; the success rate with 
matched non-relatives, an operation begun only a few years ago, is unknown but 
likely to be comparable, said Dr. Stephen J. Foreman, director of the 
department of hematology and bone marrow transplantation at the City of Hope 
Medical Center in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
But as it stands now, "these kids have a zero prognosis," Brenner said. "If 
there's no bone marrow transplant, they will die." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Anissa said, she tries to make herself as happy as possible. 
"A lot of people say, 'How sad.' But everybody can die. You can get killed in a 
car accident," said the teen-ager, who plans to attend Walnut High School this 
year and wants to become a psychologist counseling cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just living as happy as I can through this, you know? Once I get a donor, 
I'll be fine -- I'll be great." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Brandon nor his family could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Further information about donor testing may be obtained by calling Brea 
Community Hospital at (714) 529-4589, or Life-Savers Foundation at (800) 
999-8822.

GRADS PUT IN GOOD WORD FOR LESSONS IN ENGLISH 
</P>

<P>
Summer classes are finally over for these 25 boisterous pupils. 
</P>
<P>
After months of intense lessons, they are looking forward to a little fun. But 
not necessarily at Splash Mountain or on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
These students are more likely to prefer sipping some freshly brewed tea, 
strolling through a park or just staying indoors and engaging in some 
old-fashioned conversation. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the students -- 25 Vietnamese-American senior citizens -- graduated 
with distinction from summer English classes sponsored by the Vietnamese 
Community of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of the students was 70, and the oldest student was 83. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of only two in Orange County that specialize in teaching 
English to elderly Southeast Asian refugees. The classes also familiarize them 
with Western ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I am newly come here," said Nien Le-Van, the oldest student. "I want to talk 
to (my) grandchildren." Le, a slightly built man with a wavy white beard, is 
respectfully called Anh Hai, "oldest brother," by the others in the class. Le 
arrived in the United States three years ago at age 80. He began learning 
English a year later. 
</P>
<P>
For others in the class, learning English has given them a new way to be 
creative. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to write poetry," said Bong Ho, 72, who is also fluent in French. She 
came to the United States six years ago. But she admits that picking up English 
is harder for her now because she is older. 
</P>
<P>
"I study every day," Ho said. "I read every day. Sometimes easy. Sometimes 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Payne Nguyen, an adult education teacher from the Garden Grove Unified 
School District, has been the students' guide to Western culture and the 
language they seek to master. 
</P>
<P>
The center began holding classes for seniors about five years ago in a small 
room in a shopping mall storefront on West McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has more than 325,000 residents who are 60 or older, said Nancy 
Schneider, supervisor of the county's Senior Citizens Information and Referral 
program. Of those, an estimated 7,200 are of Vietnamese background. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have trouble learning English sometimes face loneliness and have 
trouble understanding -- and being understood by -- their own English-speaking 
children and grandchildren, said Minh Ngoc Le, who coordinates the seniors 
program for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, the 25 seniors who graduated Friday had been walking, biking and 
catching buses and shuttles so they could get to class and study about George 
Washington and the U.S. Constitution, as well as basic English. They also 
learned about hamburgers, street signs and slang. 
</P>
<P>
During the school term, each student was grouped according to fluency. Some 
began without knowing how to even read or write in Vietnamese. Others had 
already learned the basics of English and were picking up American phrases, 
such as, "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
At the graduation ceremony, the seniors shared sweet buns, croissants, giant 
peaches, 7-Up and jasmine tea. There would have been 30 students, but Payne 
Nguyen excused five because they had to baby-sit grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began with the students singing "The Star-Spangled Banner." Some 
were shy and preferred to mouth it, while others belted out the words as loud 
as they could. 
</P>
<P>
One student, Wen Y. Yu, pulled out a pocket-size copy of the anthem to make 
sure he got the words right. 
</P>
<P>
"Learning English is one more reason for these seniors to get out of bed in the 
mornings," Payne Nguyen said. "They need to feel productive. They need to know 
they can still learn and communicate with their children." 
</P>
<P>
After reciting some poems and tongue twisters to show off their fluency, the 
seniors were awarded their summer diplomas -- sheets of red, yellow and blue 
paper with their names carefully printed on them. They couldn't stop admiring 
their diplomas and saying, "Thank you" -- in English.

'SUPER-STREET' GETS A BOOST; 
</P>
<P>
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BACKS S. COUNTY ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The South Orange County Chamber of Commerce is putting its political muscle 
behind a proposal to make Moulton Parkway and Street of the Golden Lantern into 
the South County's first "super-street." 
</P>
<P>
Super-streets are single highways or a series of connected roads where traffic 
is engineered to move with a minimum of stops and delays. 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber is very excited about this," said Elaine Carter of Cota de Caza, 
chairwoman-elect of the chamber. "One of the largest problems in South Orange 
County is lack of alternate roads to travel within one's own community or 
throughout South County. People have to use the freeway as a local street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Increase in Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
The chamber lobbied successfully earlier this summer to win designation of 
Golden Lantern as a super-street. Now the chamber is working to get passage of 
a proposed sales tax increase this November to fund the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission, which selects such massive 
improvements, defines a super-street as one that is overhauled to allow 
optimum, efficient travel. 
</P>
<P>
The commission named Beach Boulevard in December, 1985, as its first 
super-street project. The improvements, which call for coordinated signal 
lights and better turn areas at intersections, are still under way on Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chose Three Roads 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, the commission picked three more roads, or combinations of 
roads, to be made into new super-streets. Two would be in the North County -- 
the improvement of Katella Avenue and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The third would start in the South County and would ultimately extend to Seal 
Beach. It would start at the Street of the Golden Lantern at Coast Highway in 
Dana Point and continue to where that street merges into Moulton Parkway at 
Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Moulton Parkway would then be improved -- including being widened to six lanes 
-- from Crown Valley Parkway to its juncture with Irvine Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Goodman, transportation aide for Orange County Board of 
Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, the plan ultimately calls for Irvine and 
other cities to join in extending the super-street. Goodman said Irvine Center 
Drive, under the super-street proposal, would be expanded. "Then it would 
connect back with Moulton Parkway for a bit and then connect with Edinger 
Avenue, where it would extend all the way to Seal Beach," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is both chairman of the county supervisors and chairman of the County 
Transportation Commission -- an independent body that allocates all federal and 
state highway funds to local governments. Riley's 5th Supervisorial District 
embraces the Laguna Hills-Laguna Niguel-Dana Point area. Street of the Golden 
Lantern and Moulton Parkway cross those growing South County communities, 
Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Riley is the No. 1 proponent of this super-street for South Orange 
County," Goodman said. "The only glitch is funding. The money will depend on 
whether the half-cent sales tax increase for transportation is approved on the 
November ballot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supports Tax Increase 
</P>
<P>
Carter, of the South Orange County Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber is 
strongly backing passage of the proposed tax increase for transportation. She 
noted that the chamber had also pushed for designation of Street of the Golden 
Lantern/Moulton Parkway into super-street status before the Transportation 
Commission's action last month. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said the Transportation Commission, in picking three new proposed 
super-streets, "did not prioritize them." He said that if the tax increase 
passes in November, there would be sufficient money to launch work on all three 
new super-streets. 
</P>
<P>
"But some work is already under way in South County because the county is 
undertaking some of the improvements," Goodman said. "Essentially Golden 
Lantern is already a super-street because it is new and was built to 
super-street standards. But Moulton Parkway will need improvements." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said the South County portion of the super-street would most likely be 
completed within the next three years, if the sales tax increase passes. He 
said it will probably take longer for improvements on Irvine Center Drive and 
Edinger Avenue "because in those areas, there are city governments that must 
push the projects." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he noted, the Golden Lantern-Moulton Parkway segment in South 
County "only involves the city of Dana Point and Chairman Riley's 5th 
Supervisorial District." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riley Visits Groups 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said that Riley visits constituent groups, including Leisure World, to 
reassure them that a super-street would be helpful, not harmful. "Some in 
Leisure World worried that a super-street would limit their access to local 
streets, and that's just not true," Goodman said. "A super-street keeps traffic 
flowing at a good pace and keeps cars at intersections from spewing out 
pollution." 
</P>
<P>
South Orange County Chamber of Commerce officials, including Carter, said a 
super-street would mean many benefits for South County residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Among super-street techniques are signal coordination, additional lanes, 
removal of street parking, expanded intersection turn pockets, bus turnouts and 
driveway consolidation," said Wendy Harle, the chamber's director of public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Carter added: "In the past, most of the attention (for major highway 
improvements) has focused on central and North Orange County. Now, with the big 
growth in business as well as number of homes in South Orange County, we think 
this (super-street) program is required. We've waited a long time, and, yes, 
now we think it's our time."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS TELL PROPOSAL FOR RENEWAL OF PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim residents and business owners have been given their first glimpse of 
the city's proposal to redevelop Anaheim Plaza and surrounding retail and 
industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 people came to the city's first workshop, held at the Anaheim Family 
YMCA on Thursday, to hear plans to bring new life to the Plaza area. The plans 
have yet to be finalized, but officials said no residential areas would be 
included in the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope redevelopment will boost retail activity in and around the 
Anaheim Plaza, which has been losing stores and customers for the past several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant recommended last year that the city use its redevelopment 
authority to lure businesses back into the area. Redevelopment allows the city 
to use a higher share of property taxes to upgrade an economically blighted 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed area to be redeveloped includes Anaheim Plaza, a nearby industrial 
area bounded by Lincoln and Euclid avenues, the Santa Ana Freeway and Crescent 
Way, and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Additional public workshops and hearings will be held in the coming months to 
help establish how the area will be redeveloped. For one merchant, it will not 
happen soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sitting here losing stores, losing retailers and losing customers," said 
Chuck Cooper, 58, owner of the Hickory Farms stores at Anaheim Plaza.

MAN RUNS FROM POLICE TRAFFIC STOP, IS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton man who bolted after being stopped for a minor traffic violation 
Friday afternoon was shot in the hand by police as he fled and was then jailed 
on a felony warrant from Kansas, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A Buena Park police officer stopped a blue pickup truck in a residential area 
at Gardenia Drive and Gladiola Circle, but its 17-year-old driver and Terry A. 
Effinger, 18, its passenger, ran in opposite directions, according to Officer 
Rich McMillen, the department's public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
A passing Cypress motorcycle officer was asked to help, and while chasing 
Effinger fired one shot, striking Effinger's right hand, McMillen said. 
Effinger was later apprehended in the back yard of a nearby residence. 
</P>
<P>
Effinger was taken to a local hospital for treatment of the gunshot wound, 
according to McMillen, who said a check of records showed that he was wanted in 
Kansas on an aggravated assault warrant. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said the juvenile was found in a nearby carport and apprehended 
unharmed, McMillen said. He was arrested on suspicion of probation violation 
and was taken to Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said it was unknown whether the two suspects had been armed.

3 MORE SANTA ANA COUNCIL MEMBERS TARGETED FOR RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fundamentalist group will seek to recall six of the seven Santa Ana City 
Council members for their refusal to sign a statement promising to ban a gay 
pride festival next month at a local park. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the council members, Mayor Daniel H. Young, Patricia A. McGuigan and 
Daniel E. Griset, were given recall notices Monday night. Three others who did 
not sign the resolution were not included in that action. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of the Anaheim-based Coalition 
on Traditional Values, whose supporters are leading the recall campaign, said 
the other three deserve equal treatment and that recall notices will be 
delivered to them as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a righteous call against the six of them," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The second three are council members Ron May, Miguel A. Pulido and Richards L. 
Norton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acosta Not Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman John Acosta signed the resolution. He is not being targeted for 
the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said Sheldon was simply playing politics. Pulido and May were told on 
Monday that they were left out of the recall attempt because they will be up 
for reelection in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a tough issue and the people of Santa Ana will know we did the 
right thing," Pulido said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said the council members can stop the recall action by signing the 
first portion of his "pro-family" resolution, which states they support 
heterosexual relationships rather than homosexual ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eases Festival Stand 
</P>
<P>
In a change of heart, Sheldon said the council members can even ignore the 
bottom half of the resolution that calls for the banning of the Gay Pride 
Festival, now scheduled for Sept. 9 and 10 at Centennial Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that we want them to take a stand on the family and they refused 
to," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The group has to get 11,043 signatures for each of the recall targets. Sheldon 
said he is convinced that his supporters will have no problems. 
</P>
<P>
Norton was initially ignored by the group, thinking he was exempt from any 
recall because he has only been in office since April. 
</P>
<P>
"If this group, many of them outsiders, wants to recall me for upholding the 
law, that's their right," Norton said in a written statement. "I have faith in 
the intelligence of Santa Ana voters. They know that if we give in and break 
the law this time, Mr. Sheldon or someone else will come back again and want us 
to break some other law that they don't agree with."

FIRING OF BANNED GUNS HAS TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By day, he is stage supervisor for the popular television soap opera "General 
Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
By night, he heads an Anaheim-based gun rights group and is the organizer of a 
"banned firearms shoot" today in which anybody who pays a $15 registration fee 
can fire military-style assault weapons that will soon be illegal in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised? Don't be, says T.J. Johnston, chairman of the Gun Owners REACT 
Committee, because there are plenty of people around who don't fit the 
stereotype of the typical gun owner. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 1,000 members of Johnston's 10-month-old group are active in 
lobbying the state Legislature and organizing events such as the "banned 
firearms shoot" at the West End Gun Club in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, a firearms instructor licensed by the National Rifle Assn., said the 
event is intended to educate people about weapons safety and what he calls the 
imperiled rights of gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
So sit through a half-hour firearms safety class, step up to the table and 
choose your assault rifle, Johnston urges, because "this is your last chance to 
try these puppies out" before a ban on private ownership of semiautomatic 
weapons in California takes effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ron Parret of the San Bernardino sheriff's station in Fontana said the 
firearms shoot is legal and no special patrols of the event are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that overall education is the most important factor," Parret said. But 
he questioned the thoroughness of a half-hour firearms class. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've never had any firearms training whatsoever, it takes a lot longer 
than that," Parret said. 
</P>
<P>
To Johnston, the point of the weapons shoot is not to make people into 
marksmen. It is to demystify firearms, to take the assault weapons from the 
television screen into the hands of people who have never touched a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to educate the world that firearms are in no way a threat in the hands 
of responsible citizens," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble, as Johnston concedes, is that weapons sometimes are acquired by 
those such as Patrick Purdy, who used an AK-47 assault rifle to gun down five 
children in a Stockton schoolyard before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston attributes the Stockton killings to "insanity," and not firearms 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The California Legislature responded to the incident by passing a bill banning 
the private ownership of assault rifles. Gov. George Deukmejian signed the bill 
in May, saying the measure would help police officers in their fight against 
armed drug traffickers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Such actions politicized gun owners such as Johnston, spurring them to promote 
their cause through high-profile events. 
</P>
<P>
One of the committee's first projects was to mobilize against a proposed 
Westminster ordinance to outlaw the sale of semiautomatic weapons. The City 
Council tabled the ordinance after more than 100 people who opposed the 
ordinance showed up at a city meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's group also has circulated petitions seeking a statewide ballot 
initiative that would amend the state's Constitution to make it a right of 
people to keep and bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members also paid $1,000 to have a plane fly over Anaheim Stadium 
during this summer's All-Star game, trailing a banner reading: "The Chinese 
Don't Have a Second Amendment." That amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
provides for the right to keep and bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
And for today's weapons shoot, the committee chose to use a military-style 
assault rifle, probably the most controversial firearm on the market today. 
</P>
<P>
"Abrasive?" Johnston asked, "Yes, that's the way gun owners are. The NRA has a 
reputation for being bullheaded. We are gun owners and we are proud to say we 
are gun owners." 
</P>
<P>
The Gun Owners REACT Committee has aligned itself with state Sen. Edward R. 
Royce (R-Anaheim), whom Johnston calls "our guide." Royce did not return 
several calls seeking comment, but staff aide Richard Mersereau confirmed that 
Royce had met with that group and supported its efforts to lift firearm 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the committee plans to lobby lawmakers in hopes of defeating 73 
bills that have been introduced in this legislative session to restrict 
firearms ownership, including imposing a waiting period for the purchase of all 
guns.

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MARINE AIRPLANE WITH 2 ABOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Marine Corps observation plane with two crew members aboard disappeared on a 
practice run over the Southern California desert, prompting a search that 
failed to turn up any sign of the aircraft by late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine OV-10A Bronco left Camp Pendleton at 11:30 a.m. Thursday and 
was due back three hours later, said 1st Lt. G.C. Browne, spokesman for the 3rd 
Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered in El Toro. The aircraft, from Marine 
Observation Squadron 2, Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, was 
on a photo reconnaissance mission over the desert, said gunnery Sgt. Bob 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
A search was conducted over an area between Yuma, Ariz., and Twentynine Palms 
when the plane -- carrying a three-hour fuel supply -- was declared missing. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the pilot and an observer aboard the aircraft were not released. The 
plane was based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the aircraft is used by the Marine Corps for forward air control 
and observation. In combat, he said, the plane is used to spot enemy aircraft 
for interception by fighter jets. The pilot sits forward and the observer in 
the rear. 
</P>
<P>
The last crash of an OV-10 Bronco occurred in December, 1987, when the pilot 
and observer were killed on a routine mission in the desert near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is a multipurpose two-seater used primarily for reconnaissance, 
including artillery and naval gunfire fire control. The two-engine 
propeller-driven craft is built by Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is the earliest model of Broncos manufactured by Rockwell. According 
to Jane's: All the World's Aircraft, an authority on world aircraft 
specifications, Rockwell built 271 of the OV-10As before moving on to other 
models. 
</P>
<P>
Deliveries of the most recent model, the OV-10D, were completed in 1980, 
according to Jane's. In addition, 17 Marine Corps' OV-10As have been outfitted 
for night observation surveillance.

BREWER COACH TONY MUSER TENDS TO PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS AT BURN CENTER

<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him Talking Tony Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser, of Los 
Alamitos, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something 
that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It 
wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55% of his body. He was delirious for more than a week, 
incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of 
hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with Mike Lorenzo, 
who is recovering from burns over 80% of his body. "We haven't seen him smile 
like that since he's been here," physical therapist Linda French said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," Lewis said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in a Baltimore 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and 
wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," Muser said, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, was the turning point of 
his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I 
was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can 
be until you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," Muser 
said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique 
relationship he developed with other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

16-YEAR-OLD PITCHES 7-HITTER IN ELIMINATING FULLERTON, 9-2

MILLINGTON, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Robinson, co-coach of the Fullerton Angels, spent the early innings of 
Friday's American Legion World Series game well outside his team's dugout. 
Robinson was outside the field of play, in fact, choosing to watch the game 
through a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
He needed room to fidget, pace nervously and think about ways to light a fire 
under his players. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's no smoking allowed in the dugout," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-2 loss to Janesville, Wis., however, left Robinson's team on the outside 
looking in, too. Their second loss at Millington Legion Field eliminated the 
Angels from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Janesville right-hander Mark Sievert, a 16-year-old high school junior, pitched 
a seven-hitter, struck out five and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (39-10) had a chance to rattle Sievert early. In the second inning, 
Tho Nguyen led off with a double to left and moved to third on Steve Trachsel's 
single to right. Matt Carter drove in Nguyen with a sacrifice fly to right for 
a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Darby Carmichael followed with a single to center, moving Trachsel to third and 
bringing starting pitcher Brad Zeppieri (7-5) to the plate. Zeppieri sacrificed 
Carmichael to second, but Sievert (10-0) struck out No. 9 hitter Brad Hudak to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I known then that he was 16, I might have squeezed him," Robinson said of 
Sievert and Zeppieri's straight sacrifice bunt. "We might have tried to shake 
him up a little." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sievert shut down Fullerton. After the second inning, Sievert retired 
15 of the next 18 batters; one of the three reached on an error. Fullerton, 
which stranded two runners in the pivotal second inning and six in the game, 
left 29 runners on base in three Series games. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-1, Fullerton scored its final run in the sixth on Greg Coleman's 
home run to left. Coleman, who attended Cal State Fullerton last year but did 
not play for the Titans, was so impressive in the Region 8 tournament last week 
in Union City, Calif., that he was offered a partial scholarship at Miami 
(Fla.), left immediately after the game for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
After Coleman's homer closed the gap to three, Janesville (43-7) put the game 
out of reach in the sixth, with help from some shaky Fullerton defense. Facing 
Angel reliever Guy Pinelli, Sievert walked to open the inning and moved to 
second on Joel Schmitz's single to center. One out later, right-hander Shane 
Borowski relieved Pinelli and walked Dan Milligan to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Anderson then singled in two runs, and one out later, Fullerton shortstop 
Tom Wilson's throwing error allowed two more runs to score for a 9-2 Janesville 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem all year has been making errors at clutch times," Robinson said. 
"We did that a couple of more times today." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Friedrich and Nguyen had two hits for Fullerton. Friedrich, a 16-year-old 
outfielder who had two hits in each game, finished the Series with a team-high 
six hits in 13 at-bats.

BABY-PATIO FURNITURE COMBINATION TURNS TRICK FOR CHARLIE'S WAREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Mary Ann Galante, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some combinations are a natural. 
</P>
<P>
Take ham and eggs. Salt and Pepper. Fred and Ethel. And . . . patio and baby 
furniture? 
</P>
<P>
As unlikely as the furniture combination may sound, it apparently is a dynamic 
duo for Charlie's Warehouse in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Since the store opened in 1985, owners Lenny and Judy Small have found that a 
fairly diverse group of shoppers -- pregnant women, young couples and 
grandparents -- are interested in both kinds of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The result? About half of the customers at Charlie's Warehouse end up buying 
both patio and baby furniture, said Lenny Small. 
</P>
<P>
For Charlie's Warehouse, that translates into a 36% leap in sales last year to 
$2.25 million. For 1989, Small said he expects a further 15% jump in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Small first started his own business by selling toys and bicycles. Four years 
ago, he began experimenting with a combination of patio furniture and gardening 
supplies. When that didn't pan out, he switched to picnic supplies and patio 
furniture. But again, sales volume wasn't high enough. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, Small had seen lots of expectant mothers who were interested 
in baby furniture -- at that point the smallest segment of his business. So he 
combined that with the patio merchandise and that winning combo has racked up 
sales increases every year, Small says. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of business and professional women who are now taking time off to 
have babies. Grandparents are extremely good customers, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices aren't bargain basement, but according to Small, Charlie's Warehouse 
customers pay less than they would at a department or chain store. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the 20,000-square-foot store has cribs ranging in price from 
$110 to more than $700, the latter for a model that converts to a youth bed. 
Bedding -- including a comforter, bumper and sheet -- can be bought for about 
$280. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a wide selection -- the store carries 60 to 75 types of bedding 
-- Charlie's Warehouse also stocks just about every type of baby accessory 
imaginable. So persnickety parents can pick up, say, wall switches to match the 
rest of the nursery's decor. 
</P>
<P>
To keep shoppers coming back, Charlie's Warehouse is broadening its line to 
include such furniture as bunk beds and desks, aimed at older children and 
teens.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ROCKET NEARS LIFTOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If all goes according to schedule, a McDonnell Douglas Corp. Delta rocket will 
lift off from Cape Canaveral early Sunday evening, propelling a British 
broadcasting satellite into orbit and the United States into the 
rough-and-tumble market for commercial launches into space. 
</P>
<P>
The field is now dominated by the European rocket consortium Arianespace. But 
U.S. companies have been preparing for a run from behind since 1986, when 
President Reagan created new demand for commercial launches by effectively 
banning nongovernment cargo from future space shuttle flights after the 
Challenger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas' scheduled launch will be the first lift-off under the new 
policy. The company will be in full command of the pad and will shoulder any 
financial liability in the event of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta is designed and partially built by McDonnell Douglas' Space Systems 
Co. in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has signed up nine commercial customers, including the 
British satellite company, with each launch contract worth about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two other U.S. companies have been working hard to enter the market. Martin 
Marietta Corp. plans the first commercial launch of its Titan rocket later this 
year, while General Dynamics Corp. has plans to send up its first commercial 
Atlas next June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daunting Competition 
</P>
<P>
The companies face daunting competition from abroad, despite the U.S.'s 
traditional leadership in space exploration. And they are entering the market 
at a time when the number of launches is lower than was predicted when they 
began gearing up. "There's more supply than demand," said Judith Comeau, a vice 
president of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York, who watches the aerospace 
industry. "It's very simple." 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, launching from a complex in the jungle of French Guyana, has built 
an impressive record: 15 successful launches in 15 tries since September, 1987, 
when it ended a yearlong grounding that was called after a launch failure. It 
has had the commercial field all to itself for the last two years and holds an 
estimated two-thirds or more of the market for the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's Long March booster and the Soviet Union's Proton are being 
offered to the world for rides into space at prices sufficiently lower than 
those to be charged by U.S. companies. That has left the American firms 
complaining that these governments are unfairly subsidizing the aerospace 
companies in their countries. Further down the road, Japan is expected to 
introduce a large booster, the H-2, for its own satellite payloads and possible 
entry into the world market in the 1990s, which would create further 
competition for the three American players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's enough business on a commercial basis (alone) to enable 
all three companies to remain viable in the face of increasing foreign 
competition," said Brad Meslin, managing director of CSP Associates Inc., a 
Cambridge, Mass., firm that consults on the aerospace business. But Meslin 
suggested that the three would probably be able to stay in the market due to 
revenues from separate noncommercial rocket business with the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Pack 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics, with firm contracts for 17 commercial launches, is viewed as 
leading the pack among the American three. "We feel pretty confident that the 
decision we made to go into the commercial launch services business is really 
proving to be a good business decision," said Jack Isabel, a General Dynamics 
spokesman.

THRIFT REGULATORS CLOSE PERPETUAL SAVINGS IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal banking regulators on Friday closed Perpetual Savings and Loan Assn. in 
Santa Ana, making it the first insolvent thrift in California to be scuttled 
since the $166-billion savings and loan bailout bill was signed by President 
Bush earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators said all but $100,000 of the thrift's approximately $29 million in 
deposits are protected by federal deposit insurance. Perpetual's total assets 
are about $30.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Protected accounts will be transferred to the Bank of Industry, which will take 
over Perpetual's operations, regulators said. Perpetual's Santa Ana office will 
reopen Monday as a Bank of Industry branch, but the thrift's Westchester office 
will not reopen, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators declared Perpetual to be insolvent in 1987. Under President Bush's 
industry-rescue proposal in February, banking regulators took over management 
of Perpetual Savings last April 6. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift, one of a dozen Orange County savings and loans to be taken over 
since 1985, had been bogged down by ownership of 2.75 acres of West Hollywood 
commercial property that represented 40% of its assets and was at one point 
losing more than $100,000 a month in payments associated with the property. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Perpetual was able to sell off the property at a minor profit, but 
the thrift's losses continued. 
</P>
<P>
Perpetual's was the 10th closure since the bailout law was enacted, including 
two other closures Friday in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said previously 
that his agency would aim first at selling or closing smaller failed 
institutions like Perpetual. Under the bailout law, the FDIC has been given 
primary control over both insolvent banks and insolvent S&amp;Ls. The bill 
immediately provided the FDIC with $20 billion, which it must spend by Sept. 
30, the end of the government's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the 2,900 S&amp;Ls in the nation are considered insolvent or 
nearly so, and regulators already have control of about 300. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators also have a civil lawsuit pending against the former operators of 
Perpetual Savings, including its one-time chairman Paul Morady, claiming they 
established the S&amp;L solely to buy the West Hollywood property and sell it 
to Perpetual at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
The $8.7-million suit is pending in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

CONSEY HAS LEFT IMPRINT IN NEWPORT; 
</P>
<P>
CHANCES THAT MUSEUM TOOK WERE WORTH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to art world lore, the museum director who builds a glitzy new home 
for his institution never survives to direct it. The strain of fund raising 
puts him at loggerheads with his board of directors, and he gets sacked. Or he 
quits in exhaustion and disgust because his job is all bricks, mortar and 
building codes when he was looking for art, scholarship and graceful diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing it's not quite clear why Kevin Consey is leaving the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach; all we know is that he got a job directing 
Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art.He simply may consider it a more 
attractive professional proposition. Chicago is a real city. Orange County -- 
sleek as it is growing -- is still a kind of centerless geographic phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the fine print behind Consey's departure, it does prop up the old 
superstition. He will not be around when the fashionable architect Renzo Piano 
finishes the museum's ambitious new 10-acre home bordered by MacArthur 
Boulevard and Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Consey's arrival at the museum in 1983 and his leaving now, nearly six years 
later, mark the period of the museum's final transformation from its beginnings 
in the '60s as a funky, idealistic volunteer operation to a decently smooth, 
small professional institution. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's detractors find it excessive and yuppiefied, but there is a certain 
aura of dawning suaveness about the place that is certainly due in no small 
measure to Consey's leadership. Although he is just 37, he has been a museum 
director for 10 years, having started as head of a charmingly recycled brewery 
in San Antonio. In those days he was as slender and enthusiastic as a whippet 
puppy. Now he is girthy, bearded and courtly even when he has an urge to blow 
his stack. 
</P>
<P>
Below-stairs gossip about the museum inevitably reflects the growing pains of 
any institution, wrangles on the board, abrupt changes in staff. But what 
counts in the end is what gets on stage: the exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
These days, museum directors do not personally organize many shows, but they 
must support the ideas of their curators and sell them to the board's 
exhibitions committee. Clearly it is a crucial aesthetic role that makes up an 
important facet of any museum director's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Consey, working in tandem with his curator, Paul Schimmel, forged a program 
with a slightly offbeat quality, which, viewed from Los Angeles, had at its 
best a piquant originality. Not the sort of thing likely to turn up at the 
County Museum of Art or the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions devoted to such California artists as David Park, Wayne Theibaud 
and John McCracken gave credit where it was due. Surveys devoted to offbeat 
movements, such as figurative painting in the '50s or the second generation of 
Abstract Expressionism, revived interesting half-forgotten chapters in 
contemporary art. A show devoted to artists who attend Cal-Arts revealed the 
enormous international impact of the school's aesthetic. It is hard to imagine 
where else one might have seen a survey of Belgian modern art or a survey of 
the brilliant eccentric surrealist John Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program has its risks. Things don't always work, and the scholarship is 
sometimes imprecise. But the shows of Consey's have nurtured the museum's 
distinctive aura. Los Angeles lovers of contemporary art consider the drive 
down a must, despite the rigors of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's building plans strongly suggest larger ambitions. Ambition properly 
directed is a quality to be admired. Its danger here is a tendency toward 
fashionable homogeneity. Consey's departure will cause all facets of the museum 
to fall into new relationship. A talented new director could augment Newport's 
uniqueness. A conventional choice could lead it into the sphere of the 
baseball-card museum where everyone is very pleased because the collection and 
the exhibitions clone those in Los Angeles, New York and Cologne.

HOPE FOR BRITAIN'S ENDANGERED KITES; 
</P>
<P>
BIRD TO BE RAISED AFTER ALMOST VANISHING FROM ISLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENIS ATHERTON, The Guardian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once the majestic red kite, a huge hook-beaked bird of prey, soared in great 
numbers in the skies of Britain, scouring the ground for carrion. 
</P>
<P>
It perched on medieval city roofs and picked clean the stinking streets. It 
cleansed the countryside and even plucked dead fish from the seas. It was 
fierce, prolific and a vibrant part of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Today it has vanished from both England and Scotland and only a tiny native 
group clings on in remote Welsh valleys. Vast numbers of this magnificent bird 
have been shot, trapped and poisoned, largely in the name of protecting his 
lordship's game. 
</P>
<P>
That may be about to change. The bird is being reintroduced. The idea is not 
new. It has been in the background for the past 10 years. Now the Royal Society 
for the Protection of Birds and the Nature Conservancy Council have started a 
project to re-establish the bird . They see it as an opportunity to test the 
health of Britain's countryside and, in the long term, as an opportunity to 
link the kites of Europe with the tiny Welsh population. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan is only considered for birds that were previously established in 
the country. Before the experiment began questions needed to be answered. Had 
some of the problems which led to the bird's disappearance been reduced? Could 
they be protected once freed? Today the experts think the answers are yes. 
Times are changing. Many farmers are adapting their working practices in the 
interests of wildlife and even gamekeepers now recognize that they share the 
countryside with city dwellers and birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Spreading 
</P>
<P>
So now it is hoped that from specially chosen reintroduction sites the kite 
will spread out and establish across the whole country, even between countries. 
If the bird makes that vital jump between Europe and Wales it will be better 
placed to face any loss of habitat or decimation through disease and also, it 
is hoped, the attention of some lingering gamekeepers. Most poisoned kites are 
a by-product of illegal fox baiting and trapping. 
</P>
<P>
This summer the project is getting off the ground. Eleven birds are the nucleus 
of the experiment. They have been located in secret sites in England and 
Scotland, both, surprisingly, just a kite's flight from a major industrial 
conurbation. Ten of the newly introduced birds come from Sweden, flown over by 
Nimrod courtesy of the RAF. The 11th comes from the Welsh population. Sweden 
has only 150 breeding pairs so the young taken were the smallest in the nest, 
the ones least likely to survive naturally. But given good food and care over 
here they have every chance of developing into good adult specimens. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was a capital crime to kill the kite because of its scavenging role. 
But the bird continued to be persecuted, mainly because it had a reputation for 
taking domestic fowls. In one season during medieval times 380 kites were 
killed in Tenterden, Kent, alone. At the same time better levels of hygiene and 
the lack of carrion contributed to the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1905 there were only about a dozen kites left in Britain, all in the Upper 
Towey Valley. By 1986 the position had improved slightly. Forty-eight pairs 
hatched 29 chicks. But Towey is not a naturally hospitable place for kites -- 
the carrion is scarce. Their young are small and far less healthy than their 
European cousins. Last year 10 adult birds were found dead, mostly poisoned by 
gamekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pheasants Get Priority 
</P>
<P>
Many dedicated people have worked to increase the Welsh kite numbers in recent 
years. However, as the birds stray beyond the small protected area so they tend 
to fail, the needs of pheasants come before the needs of kites. The Welsh kites 
are in a ghetto -- unable to reach kites in northern Europe and increase their 
chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Kites need a countryside unpolluted by pesticides, untidy and more 
traditionally managed than is the case in most farming areas today. Hedgerows, 
copses, woodland and bills are havens for kites and it was to two landowners 
with this kind of property that the NCC and the RSPB turned. 
</P>
<P>
For the experiment the young birds have been installed in large wooden cages 
and protected from as much disturbance as possible. But they are wild birds and 
they will be released as soon as they are old and strong enough to fly free. It 
is hoped initially that they will go only short distances, returning for the 
food placed out for them. But slowly they will venture farther until fully 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
Their care is a monumental task for the project's Dr. Ian Evans, an 
acknowledged expert in a wide theater of ecology, who has reared many orphaned 
and damaged birds of prey, and has both the technical and handling skills to 
make the project work. He spent weeks studying the Welsh kites. So that the 
birds do not become over-tame he is simulating the actions of a mother bird by 
providing meat at regular intervals through a small hatch at the back of the 
large cages. His hand imitates the movement of her beak throwing the food into 
the "nest" -- a simple ledge in a corner of the cage. The food is provided by 
the English estate's gamekeeper who is keen to show that not all his ilk are 
against birds of prey. His supply of local squirrels and other tidbits provide 
a balanced diet for the young birds. 
</P>
<P>
Four times daily Ian visits his kite families, watching them for at least 12 
hours, seven days a week. And this, he says, is the easy time. 
</P>
<P>
At about 3 months the birds will be set free from the cages -- the age they 
would leave the nest in the wild. But Ian will continue feeding them through 
next winter, again as the parent birds would do; their most vulnerable time 
being when the food and weather is against them. In the spring another 10 birds 
will be introduced and so on for at least 10 years until the population can be 
seen to be both thriving and breeding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Improve on Nature 
</P>
<P>
The chairman, Dr. Mike Pienkowski, responsible for the ornithology of the NCC, 
hopes the project will do better than nature. "The usual death rate is 50% in 
nature. We have to improve on that if our kites are to grow to maturity and 
breed. In this project natural selection takes a back seat." 
</P>
<P>
The success of the enterprise will not be known until the birds start to breed 
at about the age of 4. Previous experience in reintroduction with the 
white-tailed sea eagle in Scotland, the only other major program in this 
country, has shown that 10 years may pass before the birds start to breed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the birds will have to be tracked over thousands of hours. Each bird 
will be released with a small radio transmitter attached to its tail feathers. 
The tracker, using a direction-finding radio receiver, has to locate the bird 
to a small area before homing in quietly in order to avoid disturbing it. The 
tracking is vital, to locate the birds' nests at breeding time. Only in this 
way can a watch be kept for egg collectors and other human predators. People 
will be the problem. Down the centuries people have always been fascinated by 
kites. 
</P>
<P>
They are known for plunging from rooftops and snatching food from the hand -- 
an experience much enjoyed by children in towns throughout the country until a 
century ago. But how do you enable the thousands who are keen to see the bird 
enjoy it without causing disturbance? 
</P>
<P>
The bird comes first. To that end the new locations will remain secret, 
inaccessible places on private land. People will eventually see the kites as 
they mature and fly in search of food. Roosts and favored feeding areas may be 
discovered, but, hopefully, the initial homes will remain secret. Until, that 
is, numbers have grown. We are still a far cry from the days when Shakespeare 
could talk of London as "a city of crows and kites."

PETS OWNERS NEED TO BE ON GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
RISKS OF ANIMALS TRANSMITTING DISEASES A SERIOUS MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN THOMPSON, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Best friends. That's the way a Baltimore woman described her pint-size terrier, 
who greeted her each morning with tail wagging. He slept curled on the pillow 
next to her own -- until the day last month when she found ticks on her arm, 
her linens and her dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a panic," she says. "All those warnings you hear about diseases. I 
never worried about it before, but I was upset." So upset she gave the dog a 
repellent dip and banished him from the bedroom for the rest of the summer tick 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of an animal sharing a bug that can transmit disease -- or 
directly giving bacteria or parasites to a human -- is relatively low. But 
cases occur across the country. The risks of getting roundworm, toxoplasmosis, 
rabies and other animal-related illnesses must be taken seriously, say 
infectious disease specialists. 
</P>
<P>
In a society in which animals are treated as family members, it's only logical. 
Husbands and wives share colds. Children give chicken pox and measles to 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
Pets can also carry home diseases. To be sure, the majority of 
animal-transmitted sicknesses cause little more than discomfort. Misdiagnoses 
often occur because the symptoms are similar to so many other ailments: fever, 
nausea, diarrhea, aches, rashes, sweats or chills and flu-like reactions. 
Untreated, however, some bacterial and parasitic ailments escalate to 
debilitation and even death. Advising the family physician or emergency room 
that you've been bitten or scratched, therefore, can make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors stress that for the majority of pet owners who have strong immune 
systems, owning an animal can be beneficial as well as safe. The problem is one 
of awareness, says Dr. Peter Schantz, an epidemiologist and veterinarian at the 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Most pet owners don't realize that they 
can take simple precautions against catching their pets' diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to keep the pet's living area clean; feeding with raw, undercooked or 
spoiled meats; forgetting to wash hands after contact with the pet; allowing 
the animal to run free in areas where wildlife or strays roam -- these are 
health-risk behaviors of humans. Ignoring routine veterinary care such as 
worming and vaccinations is like opening the front door and inviting disease 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"I have dogs and cats, and I have kids, and I feel that it's very easy to have 
pets and reduce the risks," Schantz says. "The infectious disease risks 
associated with pets are not that severe that they counterbalance the 
recognized values of owning pets." 
</P>
<P>
Americans, by and large, agree. Our love affair with pets grows annually. About 
52.4 million dogs live in about 34.7 million households -- about 1.5 pooches to 
each household. The cat population is even larger: 54.6 million, or about two 
cats to each household. Celebrities like pop singer Michael Jackson, a giraffe 
and chimpanzee owner, make exotic creatures "status" pets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inconveniences Outweighed 
</P>
<P>
With all these pets, responsibilities and risks tug at the owner's end of the 
leash. Lloyd H. Ross, chief of Baltimore's animal control bureau, an arm of the 
city Health Department, says the public health benefits of leash and 
pooper-scooper laws outweigh their perceived inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
When pets foul parks, yards, playgrounds and sandboxes, parasites can be left 
in the soil or sand, he says. Uncontrolled animals also pose the risks of bites 
and scratches, which can be traumas in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The health risks can be reduced with responsible pet ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the neglected pet that could conceivably be a health concern," says Dr. 
Jack Grigor, chief of Maryland's Center for Veterinary Public Health. "I think 
a healthy pet is a safe pet." 
</P>
<P>
His office works to safeguard human health -- not just animal health. 
Throughout history, veterinarians have had crucial roles in detecting zoonoses 
(zoh-oh-no-ses), diseases transmitted from animals to humans. In some Western 
states, vets are working to halt bubonic plague transmitted by fleas, the 
medieval world's black death, which still exists. They helped rope in 
tuberculosis, once widely spread by infected livestock and now nearly 
eradicated in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For pet owners, history can be a lesson: The vet as well as the physician, the 
control of the pet's habitat and sanitation and hygiene protect not only the 
pet, but the entire family.

SHOTS MAY BE NEEDED IF BITTEN BY A PET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jean Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are steps to take if bitten by a pet: 
</P>
<P>
Wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water. 
</P>
<P>
Seek medical attention. A doctor may recommend a tetanus shot. (Tetanus isn't 
an animal-borne disease, but rather a bacterium which can infect through 
wounds.) If the situation warrants, the doctor also may recommend rabies 
treatment as a preventive measure. 
</P>
<P>
Report the bite to the animal control bureau in your area. If it was not your 
pet, try to obtain the owner's name and address. Try to learn whether the 
animal has been inoculated for rabies or has had contact with potentially rabid 
wildlife. If the animal appears to be a stray, try to identify the area it has 
been sighted in. If it is your pet, have ready the date of your pet's rabies 
vaccination; the physician and animal control will inquire. 
</P>
<P>
Be alert to the possibility of infection during the days after the bite. Report 
to your physician any change in health, such as fever, lymph-node swelling, 
nausea or vomiting or rash. 
</P>
<P>
Alert your veterinarian if the pet's biting or aggressive behavior persists. 
This isn't "normal" behavior for a pet and may signal a problem that could lead 
to further risk to you. Jean Thompson

DO THE ANIMAL ACTIVISTS DESPISE HUMANS? STICKER ON CAR SAYS THEY SURE DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B.D. COLEN, B.D. Colen is the Pulitzer Prize-winning science editor at 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roy Hanson was right. 
</P>
<P>
Roy was a bright, thoughtful and kind writer and editor with whom it was my 
privilege to work. And while he had seemingly endless patience with writers who 
needed his help, or friends or colleagues with problems, he had absolutely no 
patience for the disingenuous of this world. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, whenever the subject of the animal "rights" movement came up -- as it 
often does among those working on a newspaper science section -- Roy would 
announce with great vehemence, "You know what the problem is with those . . . ? 
They hate people!" 
</P>
<P>
Despite having little use for the movement, which I believe is interfering with 
necessary scientific research and progress, I found it difficult to accept 
Roy's analysis of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But one weekend recently, I finally realized that Roy was probably right. 
</P>
<P>
My revelation came in the form of a bumper sticker, and rarely, if ever, have I 
seen as revealing a sticker. 
</P>
<P>
The car was a shiny, perky Honda Civic, driven by an equally shiny, perky young 
woman who appeared to be in her early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
The rear bumper displayed a series of messages, all of them announcing the 
driver's devotion to the cause of animal "rights." One sticker proclaimed the 
joys of vegetarianism. One carried a picture of a closely confined calf with 
sad eyes and suggested that no humane human would eat such a creature. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's certainly nothing inherently wrong with vegetarianism -- assuming 
that, unlike many vegetarians, one is careful to eat a properly nourishing 
vegetarian diet. And the calf did look pitiful. So while I certainly didn't 
agree with the driver's sentiments, they didn't upset me. Until I noticed the 
last sticker: 
</P>
<P>
"Warning: I Don't Brake for Vivisectionists" 
</P>
<P>
There it was, out in the open. Printed proof of what I have long suspected: A 
good number of people in the animal "rights" movement value what they consider 
the "rights" of animals more highly than they value the most basic right -- the 
right to life -- of their fellow human beings. 
</P>
<P>
Before you suggest that the above is a sweeping condemnation of an entire group 
of people based on a message on the back bumper of a single car, I would point 
out that the bumper sticker was obviously commercially printed and bore the 
name of a prominent, radical animal "rights" organization. So the Civic driver 
is obviously not the only person expressing this preference for calves over 
"vivisectionists." 
</P>
<P>
It's horrifying enough that anyone would suggest a willingness to run over any 
other human being. But consider for a moment who these animal "rights" 
advocates are proposing to run over. 
</P>
<P>
While the term "vivisectionist" may conjure up an image of some ghoul in a 
blood-soaked smock laughingly hooking up a kitten to an auto battery, the 
American Heritage Dictionary defines a vivisection as "the act of cutting into 
or dissecting the body of a living animal, esp. for the purpose of scientific 
research" (emphasis is mine). 
</P>
<P>
Note that that definition says nothing about cruelty. It says nothing about 
frivolousness of purpose. It says nothing about pain. It says nothing about a 
lack of anesthesia for the animal or about unsterile conditions. It does not 
even say anything about killing an animal. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there are some unnecessary "scientific" experiments involving animals. 
And no doubt there are some animals subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering 
in the name of "research." A perfect example of that was the use of rabbits to 
test cosmetics. There are abuses of one kind or another in virtually every area 
of human endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
However, most medical and scientific research and teaching that uses live 
animals uses them because they are the best model we have for the human system. 
Most animals are used in research to gain knowledge that will benefit human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough to blindly oppose all human medical research involving 
animals, because ending such research would, without a doubt, lead to an early, 
painful, death for large numbers of humans. Thus anyone opposing all animal 
research is clearly implying that they value the lives of other species over 
those of human beings. 
</P>
<P>
But implying something is one thing, clearly stating it is another. And that 
bumper sticker leaves no room for doubt: 
</P>
<P>
Roy was right.

DISCOVERY: MUCKENTHALER CULTURAL CENTER

From the outside, the Muckenthaler Cultural Center is a slice of old Fullerton, 
looking down on Malvern Avenue from the middle of a carefully manicured expanse 
of green. Inside, though, the 66-year-old mansion is often home to some of the 
latest in contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a building in the 1915 Exposition at San Diego's Balboa Park, the 
Italian Renaissance-style home (designed by architect Frank Benchley) was built 
in 1924 for Walter and Adella Muckenthaler. Walter's father, Albert, had moved 
to Anaheim with his family in 1909; Adella was born Adella Kraemer, daughter of 
one of the area's most powerful agricultural families and great-granddaughter 
of Bernardo Yorba, holder of one of the original Spanish land grants. The home 
was donated to the city of Fullerton in 1965 and is now on the National 
Register of Historic Buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The home was used for art and drama classes and other activities until 1981, 
when it was closed for a $525,000 renovation that was completed in 1984. An 
outdoor amphitheater has since been added and other improvements are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors enter the gallery through the home's original double wooden doors, 
which are now in sight of the colorful sets for the final production in this 
season's Theatre on the Green, "Musical Comedy Murders of 1940." The art 
exhibit now on display is "The Traveling Show: Art Influenced by 
Transportation," which features sculptures and installations by such 
unconventional artists as Craig Stecyk and Dustin Shuler, in addition to more 
traditional paintings and drawings. Both the play and the exhibit end Sept. 3. 
Workshops, lectures and demonstrations for children and adults continue 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; noon to 5 p.m. Sunday 
(closed major holidays).

FAMILY LIFE: COMMUNICATION VITAL BEFORE AND AFTER DRUG ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a friend who began a slide into heavy drug and alcohol abuse at the age 
of 10. At one point in his early teens, he fell into such paranoia that he 
spent much of his time in the closet with the door closed and the light off. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you there's something wrong with that child," he overheard his mother 
tell his father one evening. "It's not normal to be sitting in the closet all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, leave him alone," replied the father. "He's just a kid, and all kids act a 
little strange sometimes. He's just going through a phase. Don't worry about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the phase lasted another dozen years -- 12 years of horror and near-death 
before he got some help. And he was one of the lucky ones. He survived. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the parents do something? Because they were normal parents. They 
simply didn't want to know. 
</P>
<P>
They were also what a therapist friend of mine calls "frozen in time" -- too 
wrapped up in their own lives and goals and careers and social whirls and 
unwilling to be distracted. 
</P>
<P>
It's called denial, and it is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in our 
near-hysterical struggle to overcome substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
We want the quick fix. Send troops to Colombia. Execute dealers. Give users 
(but not my child, please) mandatory prison sentences. Have mandatory drug 
testing in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
But any satisfactory, lasting solution may be a lot closer to home than Bogota. 
It is the home, according to two experts. 
</P>
<P>
And they say it's not in drug-testing kits or checkoff lists of symptoms, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a professional can tell the difference between some normal adolescent 
behavior and indications of drug use," says Jack Platt, coordinator of the 
chemical dependency program at Capistrano by the Sea Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
And Theresa Thomson, a family therapist in Newport Beach, agrees. Those 
checkoff lists you see tell you to watch for mood changes, changes in friends, 
lower grades, irrational outbursts, things like that -- "many of the very 
things many teen-agers go through in their normal development," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Platt provides some examples: "Your son is staying out late and getting up with 
bloodshot eyes. Is he drinking or using? Or, has he become sexually active and 
is just plain tired? 
</P>
<P>
"Your daughter becomes withdrawn and depressed. Is she coming down from a 
cocaine trip or did she just break up with her boyfriend?" 
</P>
<P>
Platt also points out that people react differently to drugs. "Some people 
become very aggressive while withdrawing from cocaine, while others become very 
placid," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is, will your children tell you what's really the problem? 
And, if they do, will you believe them? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't not talk to your kid for 12 years and suddenly expect to have 
instant rapport," Platt says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old and tired line, I know, but prevention is the best treatment -- 
and communication is the key to prevention." It is also the key, he says, to 
handling the problem, should it arise. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug abuse is not an individual problem; it is a family problem and has to be 
treated as such," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you suspect there's a problem, go to your child and tell him your concerns. 
And make sure you don't make him the problem. If you find you can't 
communicate, don't send him into treatment or therapy alone; grab the whole 
family and get everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson says that too often the parents have a "here's-the-money-now-fix-him" 
attitude, like hiring a plumber to repair a leak somewhere. When the treatment 
fails, they blame the therapist. 
</P>
<P>
"Many kids use drugs to deal with family problems," Thomson says. "Or with 
their own problems. And how can parents be there for their children if they 
don't even know what their problems are? 
</P>
<P>
"Parents must look at themselves and ask: 'What kind of a role model am I?' 
It's awfully hard for a kid to accept advice on drinking or drugs from a parent 
who's sitting there smoking and sipping martinis." 
</P>
<P>
As far as home drug-testing kits, "I shudder at the thought of parents shining 
a flashlight into their kids' eyes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to isolate your children and create total distrust, test them for 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Platt says mandatory school or home testing "depend on how much of a police 
state you want." 
</P>
<P>
"Oppression works -- for a short time anyway," he says. "If, for example, you 
really wanted to keep people from going over 55 on the freeways, you could 
shoot everyone who violated the law. Just shoot 'em and dump the bodies on the 
freeway shoulder and leave them there. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee the speeding would stop. Of course, the revolution would start. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is you have to balance punitive actions with the ideals of our 
society. It's the same with a family. 
</P>
<P>
"You must balance your actions as a parent with the ideals of the family. You 
don't want to be destroying the family in some misguided effort to eliminate 
one problem -- like drugs -- that might not even exist." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Thomson nor Platt underestimates the seriousness of alcohol and drugs. 
After all, they deal with the destructiveness of abuse on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that they both know there's no simple solution -- no pill, no magic 
wand. 
</P>
<P>
And they're both convinced that so many of the problems could be headed off 
early by getting the family on the right course with values, openness and 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are growing both physically and emotionally," Platt says. "And if the 
parents are growing emotionally, too, they're both on the same track and they 
will have access to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's trust, straightforwardness, honesty and understanding on the part 
of the parents, the kids will respond in a like manner. "In the long run, it's 
the easiest way out."

JOSEPH N. BELL: LETTERS -- WE GET LOTS AND LOTS OF LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

OK, OK, so I flunked map reading. Maybe that's why the U.S. Navy took me out of 
dive bombers, where I had to do my own navigating, and put me in transports 
which came equipped with a live navigator. One of them must have told me -- and 
I believed him all these years -- that Manus Island is in the Philippines 
instead of the Admiralty Islands, of which I have been reminded frequently and 
with some glee this past week. (One unsigned card said, "When did they move 
Manus from the Admiralty Islands to the Philippines? Incidentally, of all the 
Naval aviators I ever knew, you are the only one who is a pinko.") 
</P>
<P>
Geography aside, there have been some interesting and thoughtful reactions from 
readers about my long auto trip and subsequent columns. The piece on being a 
liberal in Orange County attracted the most mail, mostly from people who were 
feeling very lonely Out There. Lisa Kaye of Irvine wrote: "You are not alone. 
It amazes me that there are over 400,000 Democrats in Orange County. Sometimes 
I think we are all in hiding." 
</P>
<P>
An uneasy convert who concluded her letter "Unsigned for Obvious Reasons" 
wrote: "I am a registered Republican and have become more and more liberal as 
the years go by. My children, also Orange County residents who were raised 
during my 'conservative' years, now consider me almost radical. . . . While I 
feel a certain amount of guilt about remaining in the political closet . . . 
since I am nominally one of 'them,' my ideas are given consideration (and) I 
pride myself that some conversations may even have changed a few minds." 
</P>
<P>
And Teddi Alves of Huntington Beach chided me -- in a long letter -- for "what 
I consider the cardinal sin of 'journalism,' the expectation that someone 
(else) will do the work for you. Why haven't you become involved?" 
</P>
<P>
There was a delightful letter from novelist, journalist, former press secretary 
for Hubert Humphrey and ex-RAF pilot Dan Brennan of Huntington Beach about my 
column on my stepson's desire to remain 11 years old. Wrote Brennan: "I wanted 
to stay 9, and I told my mother I never wanted to get any older. It came from a 
glorious summer playing war with lead soldiers and flying WWI model airplanes 
in the neighborhood vacant lot -- a huge lot on an avenue filled with 
three-story brick and wooden houses, replete with big porches. . . . Ten years 
later, I was helping carry dead and wounded out of RAF bombers and later B-17s. 
. . . Where are the vacant lots of yesteryear?" 
</P>
<P>
Where, indeed? And the rubber guns and swimming holes and pickup baseball games 
free of parents and uniforms. And coffee cigarettes and movie serials and 
contemplating life from a front-porch swing? 
</P>
<P>
The open letter to former President Jimmy Carter also brought a variety of 
thoughtful responses. Mrs. R.L. Crow of Seal Beach wrote: "I feel exactly as 
you do about Jimmy Carter and wish I could have written him as you did. I'm so 
glad your family attended his Sunday school class and that you wrote about it 
in the L.A. Times so that hundreds of us could share your pleasure in his talk. 
. . . I have felt that he and Rosalynn have really been ridiculed and looked 
down on by too many residents of our county who never did appreciate their many 
wonderful characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
And Wiley B. Burnes of Westminster wrote: "Your open letter on the Jimmy Carter 
Bible class . . . sounded a lot like me some years ago. I had the same 
difficulty with what I felt was the simplicity of black-and-white Christianity. 
The person who helped me most was C.S. Lewis. He was a professor at Oxford and 
in his earlier years an agnostic. He traveled a hard road in what he called his 
'spiritual quest' and one of the best little books anywhere is his 'Mere 
Christianity.' 
</P>
<P>
"Let me urge you to pick it up. . . . It's fun reading from a philosophical 
view (and) it helped me immensely with that 'terribly uneasy' feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Johnson of Corona del Mar offered a temperate and well-reasoned argument 
for homeowner groups in response to my column about the South Laguna resident 
who is being forced to cut down her trees. Wrote Johnson: "Your article . . . 
seemed to skirt over the reason why the community association wanted Mrs. 
Trudeau to remove her trees. I think it is obvious that the trees in question 
were some kind of nuisance to the views of (her) neighbors. Your article seemed 
to be in sympathy with her, but what about those who have seen their ocean 
views, something that many homeowners in this area also treasure, eroded slowly 
by the growing trees? 
</P>
<P>
"We in Jasmine Creek have a similar problem with some unfeeling and unfriendly 
adjacent property owners who maintain trees and bushes in violation of their 
own community regulations and block our view to the ocean. You would be 
surprised -- and, I suspect, ashamed -- of these people who insist that all 
trees blocking their views be trimmed, but refuse to trim their own for anyone 
else's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"These people defy . . . common courtesy and, yes, even (threaten) lawsuits to 
keep from spending a few dollars to help their neighbors have a view." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, my summer travels across the United States touched a vein of 
wanderlust and nostalgia that was caught nicely by Ray Bracy of Tustin, who 
wrote: "I, also, have just returned from a lengthy automobile trip through the 
northern areas. As usual, I was refreshed by the physical beauty and diversity 
of our country. I saw rivers with water in them, plus lovely green forests and 
plains. In many areas, the drought is broken, and the crops look lush. The 
Midwestern cornfields and soybeans give promise of a bountiful harvest. Those 
damper areas have one more thing lacking in Southern California -- mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in Southern California since 1957. I like it, but I find myself 
exasperated at times with the crowding, the air pollution, the traffic. When I 
travel away from the area, I indulge in a nostalgia for living elsewhere. I 
don't think that it would work. As with others in this area, I have become so 
used to being able to be outdoors whenever I choose or go to the nursery for 
new plants, that I couldn't readjust to those long, snowbound winters." 
</P>
<P>
Amen, Ray. Amen.

PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTOGRAPHER IS TAKING A SHOT AT RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Photographers generally have very little name recognition, something David 
Holzman is determined to change for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach photographer has just published eight color posters and 
hopes to become a household name with his works, including images of sunset at 
the Balboa, Newport and Huntington Beach piers. 
</P>
<P>
His posters were printed by Ultracolor in El Segundo for $65,000 and financed 
by one of his patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get my art seen by as many people as possible in an art medium," 
Holzman said. He doesn't want it "used as a background for something else like 
advertisements or commercial work. I felt my work was strong enough to stand by 
itself as an art statement." 
</P>
<P>
The posters retail for $25 and are sold as far away as Japan, France, Norway, 
West Germany and Malaysia. About 100 stores in the United States carry the 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
Galleries selling Holzman's posters in Orange County include Art Images in 
Huntington Beach, Z Galleries in Santa Ana, Art Dimension Gallery in Newport 
Beach and Preferred Graphics in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Holzman decided it was important to release the series all at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you want to introduce posters and get taken seriously by the poster 
and art business . . . you release eight and they take notice," he said. "They 
want to be able to choose between them. I tried to make a series of shots but 
at the same time have each photograph reach a different kind of audience." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles in 1960 and raised in suburban Sherman Oaks, Holzman got 
his first exposure to photography at 15 by sneaking his camera into rock 
concerts. He borrowed his mother's camera, got a five-minute photography 
workshop from the local camera store salesman and shot one roll of film at a 
Peter Gabriel concert. 
</P>
<P>
He continued for a few years by shooting concerts for record companies. But he 
just wasn't making any money in rock 'n' roll photography. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school, Holzman moved to Mammoth, where he almost 
literally fell into his career. He broke his leg on his 18th birthday while 
training to be a professional skier. He returned to the Southland and started 
to study photography at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 he and a friend opened a 500-square-foot studio at the corner of 
Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, not one of the ritziest spots in town. 
"One night we went to lock up and there was a guy injecting heroin in the 
bathroom," Holzman said. "By the time we called the police he had overdosed." 
</P>
<P>
He eventually moved up to a 5,000-square-foot studio in downtown Los Angeles. 
He called it Studio 301. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working seven days a week, 15 hours a day, just to cover the overhead of 
the studio, my car and my apartment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for a new direction. So, he exited left, and headed south. 
</P>
<P>
Holzman says it was the smartest thing he ever did because that's how he 
learned the difference between art and commercial work. 
</P>
<P>
He found a room for rent in Newport Beach and spent his time shooting 
photographs, surfing, riding his bicycle and skateboarding. He spent six months 
working on one pier shot. He says every time he thought there would be a sunset 
he liked he would ride his bike to Newport Pier to photograph it. 
</P>
<P>
After two years he started getting free-lance jobs and was having fun doing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Holzman says being a photographer is a lot like being an actor. 
</P>
<P>
"You both walk around with a portfolio, you have to meet people you've never 
met and impress them with your personality and your book," Holzman said. "What 
people don't realize is that so much of a photographer's success is the 
business end. It's so expensive to have cameras, film and put yourself in the 
places you want to photograph. If I just wanted to do my artwork I could never 
make it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the artwork just pays for itself. It doesn't put any money in my 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Holzman was motivated by the work of Ansel Adams and Edward Weston. "When I saw 
their work I was inspired by the greatness of it. It stood alone, better than 
all the other photographs I had seen. I learned from their composition and the 
way they went about creating." 
</P>
