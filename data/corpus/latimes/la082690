BALZER ON WINE: THE OTHER MONDAVI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINCE THE MONDAVI BROTHERS split up in 1965, much has been written about Robert 
Mondavi and his award-winning wines. But little has been heard of Peter and the 
Charles Krug Winery that the brothers once shared. 
</P>
<P>
This Napa Valley winery continues to be a family operation -- albeit Peter's 
family. His son Peter Jr., with engineering degrees from Stanford, helped 
design the winery's temperature-control systems and the computerized crushing 
area. Marc, the younger son, supervises 1,200 acres of some of the finest 
vineyards in the valley, including the winery's two choice vineyards in Los 
Carneros, from which the vintage Pinot Noir and barrel-fermented Chardonnays 
are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Marc has worked at the winery since he was 10. "I did just about everything, 
jobs nobody else wanted to do," he says. "I learned from the ground up. It was 
the ground I liked best, the vineyards. That's why I went to UC Davis, to study 
viticulture and enology." 
</P>
<P>
Although the winery's fresh, fruity Chenin Blanc has always been its hallmark 
wine, it also produces superior Cabernet Sauvignon. As part of the 40th 
anniversary of its "Vintage Selection," the first private-reserve bottlings of 
Cabernet Sauvignons, Charles Krug released the '84, '83 and '81 editions. 
</P>
<P>
Some notes on the new releases: 
</P>
<P>
Charles Krug 1988 Chardonnay Los Carneros, $11.50. The bouquet suggests apples; 
the taste, lemons. This gentle wine will age beautifully yet is drinkable right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Krug 1985 Carneros-Napa Valley Pinot Noir, $8.50. Charming wine of 
jewel-garnet color with none of the tannic, tar-bitterness so often found in 
California editions of this varietal. Fine balance, remarkable delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Krug "Vintage Selection" Cabernet Sauvignon, $20. The 1984 is an 
intense ruby color. Vanilla in the bouquet adds intrigue to the still-youthful 
berryness. The California State Fair Wine Competition gave it a gold medal. The 
'83 has garnet hues, with hints of cedar in the bouquet. Good structure, but 
age will help. The loveliest of the trio is the 1981. This soft and elegant 
wine may be at its peak, but it will hold for several more years. Robert 
Lawrence Balzer

HEALTH: ACTS OF FAITH; 
</P>
<P>
DOCTORS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALING METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIRIAM SHUCHMAN MD and MICHAEL S. WILKES MD, Miriam Shuchman is a physician 
in the Clinical Scholars Program at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Michael S. 
Wilkes is a physician in the Clinical Scholars Program at UCLA Medical Center. 
Their column appears monthly.

<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN YOU'RE healthy, things like faith healing or visualization therapy can 
seem flaky or at least ineffectual. But to a person stricken with a 
life-threatening illness, even the most far-fetched herbal diet or 
psychological regimen can offer a flicker of hope. Just recently, one of us 
faced a patient with AIDS who, frustrated with his failing health, had begun 
seeking alternative treatments. He discovered a faith healer who promised a 
complete cure. The healer told the artist he must stop taking his medicine 
(eight prescriptions) as a demonstration of his true belief in the spiritual 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we advised him not to do that, but after talking to several people 
who claimed to have been cured by the healer, the patient abandoned his 
medications and our advice. Instead, he took herbal remedies to cleanse his 
system and attended group meditations and individual sessions with the healer. 
For several weeks, he was enthusiastic; he said he felt healthy and energetic 
and, for the first time in years, had hope. Then he became ill; five weeks 
later he died of a stomach infection, which his original medicines could have 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't have to happen. Alternative healing and conventional medicine are 
not -- indeed, should not be -- mutually exclusive. Traditionally, conventional 
doctors have been suspicious of unlicensed healers (and vice versa), but that 
is changing. We are beginning to recognize that one form of treatment may not 
be enough and that doctors should avoid putting patients in an either/or 
position. 
</P>
<P>
People turn to nontraditional forms of healing because they are "disillusioned 
with conventional medicine and searching for hope that is not available from 
conventional doctors," says Norman Cousins, author of best-selling books on 
self-care. It is not surprising that, in general, the more serious the illness, 
the greater the likelihood that a person will seek alternative treatments. 
Cancer is the most striking example; Americans spend about $4 billion each year 
on alternative cancer "cures," many of which have no clear scientific basis. 
These treatments range from those that are potentially dangerous, such as 
Laetrile, to those that are not well-studied, such as imagery techniques and 
massage therapies, to those that are accepted as effective, such as 
acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
People seek alternative methods because they give a feeling of control. 
Life-threatening illnesses such as cancer leave patients feeling helpless; they 
can't even make their own bodies do what they want. Radiation therapy, surgery 
and chemotherapy, administered by the doctor to the patient, do nothing to 
restore that sense of control; the patient can only endure and wait to find out 
if they've worked. But with illnesses such as heart disease, people can help 
themselves significantly by giving up smoking or changing their diet or getting 
more exercise. Alternative treatments for cancer and AIDS give patients the 
same sense of power, the same hope that they can have an impact on the illness. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what the faith healer told the artist who had AIDS: If he 
trained his mind carefully, he could beat the disease. But the healer refused 
to acknowledge the additional necessity of conventional medication. (In fact, 
he refused to return numerous phone calls from the patient's doctor or the 
clinic social worker, which should have been a clear warning sign.) Studies of 
cancer patients show that most people use alternative treatments in conjunction 
with conventional ones. And according to research done by Dr. Barrie Cassileth 
at the University of Pennsylvania, faith healing is a very common form of 
alternative treatment; diet and vitamin therapies are even more popular. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest attractions of alternative treatments, according to 
Cassileth and others, is the attention patients receive. Alternative healers, 
some of whom are MDs, favor a holistic approach and spend more time listening 
to a patient's concerns. Conventional medicine is usually aimed at disease, 
defined as a physiologic malfunction of the body. Healers, on the other hand, 
treat the ramifications of illness, which, according to medical 
anthropologists, include a person's religious, cultural and psychological 
reactions to disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently in medicine," Cousins says, "everything is technology, testing and 
procedures. Instead of listening with their ears, doctors spend too much time 
listening with their stethoscopes." Leaders in the treatment of cancer and AIDS 
agree. Recent medical journals are full of articles urging doctors to listen to 
all of their patients' concerns and to try to understand the many ways in which 
the patients are affected by disease. 
</P>
<P>
Many doctors remain concerned that those who bill themselves as alternative 
practitioners may, in reality, be quacks preying on the fears and vulnerability 
of the seriously or terminally ill. Doctors are obligated to caution their 
patients that "treatments marketed as alternatives don't meet the standards of 
safety and effectiveness set by the Food and Drug Administration," says William 
Jarvis, a health-education teacher at Loma Linda University. Jarvis, who heads 
a consumer group called the National Council Against Health Fraud, believes 
that many alternative-therapy success stories are unsubstantiated and untrue. 
He recently interviewed 150 cancer patients in California allegedly cured by 
alternative practitioners; none had actually been cured. Jarvis' organization 
has become particularly wary of the many alternative treatments offered to 
patients with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
We advise people considering unorthodox treatments to be careful when selecting 
an unproven remedy and open-minded about the possibility of combining 
traditional and nontraditional forms of healing. Research a treatment 
thoroughly and check out the attitudes of your alternative practitioner. Be 
suspicious if she or he is unwilling to speak with your regular doctor. 
Likewise, if your medical doctor refuses to consider supplementing your program 
with alternative treatments, you can probably find another with a more open 
mind. That's very important, because you should be able to discuss with your 
doctor whatever treatments you use or want. Unproven remedies can have harmful 
side effects, just as traditional medicines can, so it's crucial to keep the 
lines of communication open; if you have questions or concerns, you should be 
able to simply call and ask. And use common sense. If an unproven remedy is 
outrageously expensive or seems at all dangerous, it might end up doing more 
harm than good.

"Russia House" won't be released until the Christmas season, but already the 
movie's promotional push is underway, through a campaign for the just-published 
paperback edition of John le Carre's best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
Promo and art -- of stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer -- can be found 
inside the front cover of 2 million Bantam reprints. 
</P>
<P>
The same plug appears in a dozen other newly reissued Le Carre titles from 
Bantam. A recent 30-second national TV spot pushed both book and film; ditto 
trailers in theaters. When Bantam issues the "movie edition" of "Russia House" 
in November, the movie's art will grace the cover.

ON THE RECORD: SIR THOMAS GETS THE FULL TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken a long time for a major homage to Sir Thomas Beecham (1879-1961) 
to appear on compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is difficult to determine considering the near-legendary status the 
British conductor had already achieved well before the end of his lengthy 
career. There may have grown a general suspicion that Beecham was more verbal 
wit and cleverness than interpretive depth. 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested as well that his silver-spoon upbringing and Brahmin 
attitudes rubbed many of his musical compatriots the wrong way in the 
Labor-dominated Britain of the years following his death. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons for the delay, Beecham is getting the full memorial 
treatment from EMI/-Angel. With some 20 CDs now available, most midpriced (as 
are all those discussed here) and more to come, usually with his own Royal 
Philharmonic and dating from the 1950s, a clear picture of the Beecham 
interpretive persona is emerging. He was, after all, as happy in the recording 
studio as in the concert hall or opera house. 
</P>
<P>
It will come as news only to the generation now making the conductor's 
acquaintance that he was hardly a blanket admirer of the Great Classics, often 
preferring the marginal and even (to other ears) trivial to the accepted 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he thought more highly of one of the dubiously legitimate 
offspring of Beethoven's Ninth, Liszt's "Faust" Symphony (63371), than of the 
venerated parent. Through his caressing, diligent exposition of its 
fascinatingly wayward construction -- but without shortchanging its inherent 
theatricality -- Beecham makes one, if not necessarily a believer in an often 
garish score, patient enough to pay it attention and then some. 
</P>
<P>
Beecham was Sibelius' most ardent champion throughout the Finnish composer's 
active career and well after his initial vogue had passed. Sibelius is 
represented here by a program that includes the exquisite "Pelleas et 
Melisande" Suite, in which the conductor indulges his penchant for gentle 
sentiment, and two brooding marvels of the composer's last years, the Seventh 
Symphony and "Tapiola" (63400). 
</P>
<P>
The coupling of Sibelius' Second Symphony (with the BBC Symphony) and Dvorak's 
Eighth, again with the Royals (63399), recorded live in London's Festival Hall, 
doesn't withstand close critical scrutiny. Beecham was not a big picture man, 
which is to say that these are perhaps stop-and-go, spur-of-the-moment affairs 
in which he signals what does and what does not interest him. 
</P>
<P>
One's gut reaction to both, however, is powerful. Passion and thrusting energy 
are the salient qualities, with the rousing climaxes achieved -- in the third 
movement of the Sibelius work and the finale of the Dvorak -- easily worth the 
price of admission. 
</P>
<P>
His dedication to the Russian nationalist composer Mily Balakirev indicates 
Beecham's often defiant defense of the second-rate. More loving statements of 
the composer's Oriental kitsch-suffused First Symphony and symphonic poem 
"Tamara" (63375) are unlikely. Which isn't to say the stuff isn't pretty, or 
that Borodin himself would have been ashamed of the symphony's terminally 
luscious slow movement. 
</P>
<P>
There is little Handel or charm, but much Victorian pompousness in the 
Beecham-devised ballet scores "Love in Bath" and "The Gods Go A'Begging" 
(63374). Their creation would seem to be based on the proposition that the less 
we hear of Handel, the better. Do not confuse this material with Sir Hamilton 
Harty's skillful and respectful Handel popularizations. 
</P>
<P>
Beecham didn't care for Brahms, and it shows in his herky-jerk interpretation 
of that composer's Second Symphony. But, in the coupling, he applies himself 
lovingly to the serene measures of the same composer's "Song of Destiny," 
fetchingly sung by the Beecham Choral Society (63221). 
</P>
<P>
The conductor's treatment of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is cavalier -- 
shapeless and roughly executed. Yet the coupling (on 69871) is a delight: the 
"Ruins of Athens" incidental music -- to most ears one of Beethoven's mistakes 
-- is delivered here with sparkling wit. 
</P>
<P>
The generous Schubert program (63399) embracing the Third, Fifth and Sixth 
symphonies reminds us that Beecham was doing this music at a time when no other 
conductor of consequence was interested. The performances, however, disappoint. 
The Third, which should put us in mind of Rossini, is densely textured and 
bottom-heavy, the Sixth is a coy rhythmic taffy-pull and the Fifth fails to 
maintain the lift and grace of its opening measures, becoming inappropriately 
vehement in its two concluding movements. 
</P>
<P>
A program of lightweight French music (63379) by Bizet, Delibes, Faure, Debussy 
and Saint-Saens is, however, consistently imbued with the lively rhythmicality 
and delicate sentimentality that made Beecham such a satisfying interpreter of 
this repertory.

POP FACES: LOVE AND ROCKETS' DAVID J RECHARGES WITH SOLO PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Therapy." 
</P>
<P>
That's the simple explanation Love and Rockets member David J gave for the 
existence of his new solo album, "Songs From Another Season," essentially a 
series of diary-like songs written and recorded over the past two years. One 
listen to the song "Stranded Trans-Atlantic Hotel Nearly Famous Blues" confirms 
his need to vent some frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
"That was written on the last Love and Rockets tour, in a hotel room somewhere 
in America," he said, speaking by phone from his home near London. "I can't 
even remember where, which is part of the syndrome. I wasn't (happy) at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, that time should have been one of elation for the 
singer-bassist. Love and Rockets, consisting of J and his fellow former Bauhaus 
members Daniel Ash and Kevin Haskins (J's brother), had risen above its cult 
status, headlining major concert halls in the wake of its American Top 10 
single "So Alive." Instead, he found himself depressed to be far away from his 
wife and young son (to whom he was merely "the man on the phone"), while 
enthusiastic but bothersome fans camped outside his door. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old musician is aware that some -- including those loyal fans -- 
may be a bit put off by what they might interpret as self-pity from a musician 
in what many would consider an enviable situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose there is a certain amount of that in it," he admitted. "But it's 
saying, 'Go away, but sweethearts, come back another day,' because I know I 
need that (attention)." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the therapeutic process will include going back on tour to support the 
solo album, but on a much more casual basis than with Love and Rockets. 
Accompanied by guitarist Max Eider and accordionist Owen Jones (both of whom 
were part of the Jazz Butcher's band with J in the mid-'80s), J will stick to 
small clubs, including McCabe's on Sept. 4, Bogart's on Sept. 5 and the Roxy on 
Sept. 6. The idea is to renew a sense of freshness in the music-making process 
in preparation for when and if -- yes, if -- Love and Rockets gets back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much up in the air at the moment," he said, noting that Ash and 
Haskins are both doing various side projects now. "We decided to have a 
sabbatical for a year, and that's coming to an end and it looks like it's going 
to continue into the next year. The idea is we'll get back together when we're 
really hungry to do it. We want to feel like a young band going in to record 
our first album."

O'Connor and director John Maybury avoid the most obvious -- and ignorant -- 
approaches to filming music in this 35-minute video of a 1988 London concert. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all camera angles are close-ups of her famous profile; though a backing 
band and crowd noise are heard, one fleeting look at the drummer is the only 
non-O'Connor shot. Sound static? Hardly. All sorts of colorful, abstract visual 
overlays add to and play with the black-and-white footage, somehow never 
distracting from the intimate tone the Irish singer strikes on stage; it 
remains baldly emotional. Johnny-come-lately fans take note: Seven of the eight 
songs come from her first album, not its current successor. CHRIS WILLMAN

See what singer Steven Tyler's really like backstage -- apparently the same 
leering goof he is on stage -- and wonder why guitarist Joe Perry's lips never 
move when he talks. See three recent video clips you've seen a couple hundred 
times apiece on MTV, see how key scenes were filmed, then see the band 
applauding images of itself after each clip ends. This is pretty thin product. 
Still, it's hard to dislike Tyler's bouncy exuberance, no matter where that 
exuberance is directed. (The laser-disc version, including a bonus track, is 
due in stores Thursday and retails for $24.95.) JONATHAN GOLD

"Crosstown Traffic" isn't another Jimi Hendrix biography, but an attempt to 
assess the late guitarist's life and legacy in the context of several black 
music traditions. 
</P>
<P>
The roots-savvy British critic Murray tackles some provocative themes -- 
Hendrix the black American in a white British rock world, his sexual wild-man 
image vs. the instrumental visionary. But his arguments meander so much at 
first that Hendrix becomes more a springboard for Murray's theories than the 
central thread whose life linked those issues. Just when "Crosstown Traffic" 
seems like a missed opportunity, Murray rallies behind some incisive, caustic 
musical analysis, particularly a masterful chapter on Hendrix as 
R&amp;B/soulman. Flawed and often frustrating, but worth weathering the rough 
stretches. DON SNOWDEN

Two decades, two funerals and far more than seven twists and turns in the road 
separate the Allman Brothers from their peak. 
</P>
<P>
Yet two lingering qualities from the old days allow them to continue with 
dignity intact and rehash avoided. Those are Gregg Allman's way with a soulful 
blues vocal, and guitarist Dickey Betts' ability to shape an instrumental 
excursion into a work of dramatic architecture. Not a brilliant album, but one 
that's solid and welcome. MIKE BOEHM

There's not enough of Winger's strength -- strong, basic, hard rock 'n' roll -- 
on this album. This pop-metal outfit goes wrong at every turn, whether lead 
singer Kip Winger is venturing into romance ("Rainbow in the Rose"), rebellion 
("In the Heart of the Young") or rap ("Baptized by Fire"). The group's 
million-selling 1988 debut album, "Winger," had more fire. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: *** THE NEVILLE BROTHERS "BROTHER'S KEEPER" A&amp;M: ALBUMS ARE

Undoubtedly, some among the millions who just discovered Aaron Neville, the 
linebacker-size songbird, as a featured duet partner on the recent Linda 
Ronstadt album will buy this fine new Neville Brothers effort. If they expect 
anything close to those cozy Aaron 'n' Linda love songs, though, they're in for 
a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Here Aaron shares the vocal spotlight, the syncopation rarely lets up and the 
brothers stick black consciousness and Jesus right in your face. 
</P>
<P>
Fully half the songs on "Brother's Keeper" are potent gospel tunes (including 
"Jah Love," co-written by Cyril Neville and U2's Bono). More confrontational is 
the two-part "Sons and Daughters," Art Neville's angry, Gil Scott-Heronesque 
look at inner-city despair and Establishment patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
What's missed is the weird spatial relationships producer Daniel Lanois brought 
to their last album. His cohort Malcolm Burn co-produced with the Nevilles this 
time, and "Keeper" is stuck somewhere between the novel undercurrents of the 
last record and the percussive joy of previous efforts. Nothing here is 
irresistibly danceable, but with all the other merits afoot, the brothers have 
produced yet another keeper. CHRIS WILLMAN

When you hear a rap song on the radio that disses Socrates for biting from 
Egyptian philosophers, you can be pretty sure that it's time for a new album 
from KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions, the conscience of rap. 
</P>
<P>
KRS-One is the Dylan of the South Bronx, a rapper with a hard-core reputation 
who was the first to take on drugs, homelessness, black-on-black violence. 
</P>
<P>
His Stop the Violence movement galvanized the rap community into political 
action. Last year's "Ghetto Music" went platinum, even though its hit single 
was a somewhat obscure genealogy of biblical figures; another hit off the album 
was called "My Philosophy." He's pretty much single-handedly given intelligence 
street credibility. 
</P>
<P>
On "Edutainment," KRS-One takes on misguided teachers, the government, crooked 
cops and meat. Hamburgers, to hear him talk, are a drug as addictive as crack, 
and worse for you. There's a devastating narrative about the short, brutal life 
of a drug dealer. And the beats, which seem to get rawer with each of his 
major-label albums, are minimal and tough, also supremely danceable. This is 
bound to become one of the most controversial rap albums of the year. JONATHAN

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noise, clunky glassware, a high corkage charge, uninformed service and other 
minor irritants may make the Broadway Deli seem, at first glance, a rotten 
place for a wine lover. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a restaurant with many wine-drinking virtues, and there is a lot of 
potential for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of sophistication is the single-page computerized list of wines 
embedded in one of the plastic holders at the back of the menu. There are 100 
items on it, and they are thoughtful choices, reasonably priced. 
</P>
<P>
For example, of the 85 table wines on the list, no fewer than 34 are priced 
under $20. Wonderful idea, since Trefethen Eshcol red (misspelled on the wine 
list) goes great with meat loaf and mashed potatoes . . . especially when it's 
only $11 a bottle. And there are 13 table wines by the glass, none over $5.75. 
</P>
<P>
But if your wine preferences stretch beyond the deli's list, you'll have to pay 
a $10 corkage charge -- pretty high, considering the atmosphere, service and 
glassware. 
</P>
<P>
But John Penoff, the wine manager, has grand ideas, some of which may be seen 
inside a small, triangular retail wine room in the corner of the deli's foyer: 
the temperature-controlled, glass-walled space has more than 300 facings of 
wines that evoke tremors in wine collectors. 
</P>
<P>
What first caught my eye, from 40 paces and through the glass wall, was the 
bottle of 1986 Antinori Solaia. Money alone doesn't get a restaurant this kind 
of wine. In fact money is not what this kind of wine is about. Solaia is one of 
the greatest of Italy's new-wave reds, a Cabernet-based wine that sells for $50 
a bottle upon release. However, it scarcely ever hits the retail shelf at any 
price; nearly all of it is sold under the counter to special customers. 
Fortunately for the Broadway Deli, co-owner Marvin Zeidler is a respected wine 
collector -- and one of those special customers. 
</P>
<P>
It's sold in the wine shop for $63.50 (slightly overpriced; the 1982 version 
sells for $68). Even with the $10 corkage, that means you could have it at your 
table for $73.50. Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with all the Broadway Deli's noise, and in those tiny glasses . . . . I 
mentioned this to Penoff. He admitted that he's thought of offering a better 
glass for wines of the Solaia's quality. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the wine room is filled with stuff to make a collector swoon: 
oodles of Gaja and Ceretto wines from the Piedmont of Italy, a 1959 Bordeaux, a 
slew of creative and well-priced California wines. Diners must ask for the 
complete list to take full advantage; the shorter one, inside the menu, does 
not list everything, though it includes such bargains as 1987 Bonny Doon Clos 
du Gilroy ($12.50), 1989 Bonny Doon Chardonnay ($15), 1987 Saintsbury Pinot 
Noir ($22.50), and 1988 Phelps Gewurztraminer ($12).

WELCOME TO THE DELI CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE BROADWAY DELI IN SANTA MONICA: PASTRAMI, LOX AND CREME BRULEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deli is the quintessential New York invention -- but California has just 
made it its own. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't happen to a nicer institution. Traditional delis, after all, are 
those dark, crowded, noisy places where the waiters first insult you, then 
shove sandwiches so big you don't know how to get your mouth around them in 
your direction. Finally, they insist you eat a piece of cheesecake. When you 
stagger out the door, it takes days until you're hungry again. 
</P>
<P>
But delis have their upside. Big menus. Long hours. Reasonable prices. A 
democratic attitude. Delis are places where you can take both your parents and 
your children secure in the knowledge that everyone will be happy. They're 
always ready to provide take-out on a moment's notice. They make you feel at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose somebody took all these good qualities and then gave them a California 
twist? Suppose the menu was big but the food was light? Suppose the room was 
big but the ambience was airy? Suppose the waiters were actually nice? What if 
the take-out had an upscale attitude? You'd have the perfect restaurant for the 
'90s. You'd have The Broadway Deli. 
</P>
<P>
It's a Monday afternoon and the place is packed. An intense business conference 
is taking place in one booth; two ladies are lunching in the next. Over there a 
baby slumbers in a portable seat while a 2-year-old clambers across the 
adjacent chairs. Over here at the counter, every seat is taken. At one end, an 
older woman sits contentedly chewing on a lox-topped bagel, periodically taking 
sips from an enormous cup of coffee. She shakes her head from time to time, as 
if she can't quite believe the quality of the smoked salmon (the Scottish 
smoked salmon, in particular, is very good). Next to her a Chinese man is 
devouring a chicken pot pie topped with a light puff of pastry. "This is so 
good," he says to his companion, "that I have it every time I come." 
</P>
<P>
She nods, but doesn't say anything; her mouth is full of macaroni and cheese. 
This is great macaroni and cheese -- more cheese than macaroni, the sort of 
stuff that gives you a satisfying chew. It is an astonishingly large portion, 
but this woman seems to have no trouble polishing it off. 
</P>
<P>
Next to her a teen-ager is tucking into a stack of French toast. The French 
toast is the fat puffy kind made with thickly sliced bread drenched in an egg 
mixture and lightly fried. The kid has a side of Italian sausage too, and since 
I'm sitting next to him I find myself eyeing it covetously. I know from past 
experience that this is truly terrific sausage -- the kind that's filled with 
little chunks of meat, instead of a homogenized mush -- with a slightly sweet 
tang. But I control myself; I am eating a hamburger -- and it's a big thing, on 
a home-baked bun. More important, it rates among the better burgers in town. So 
does the Caesar salad, a big, garlicky, cheesy blend of greens and dressing 
that would make any salad lover happy. 
</P>
<P>
Next to me is a man eating a pastrami sandwich and luxuriating in a huge bowl 
of fries. He looks happy. The man sitting beside him is slurping up a bowl of 
shiitake mushroom barley soup. When the waiter comes along to ask if he'd like 
anything more he shakes his head. "This is a meal in itself," he says. Not bad 
for $3.75. 
</P>
<P>
The person at the far end of the counter is having a glass of white wine and a 
dish of creamed spinach. Seems like an odd lunch to me, but she sips her wine, 
takes little bites of the spinach and stares at the cook behind the counter who 
is constructing sandwiches with enough heft to make the grade at any New York 
deli. 
</P>
<P>
The point of this recital is not just that the menu is so large that there is 
truly something for everyone, but that the menu gets a real workout. Glance 
around the room at any given time and you will find the tables laden with 
dishes from all parts of the menu. Go to a traditional deli and you'll find 
half the diners chowing down on sandwiches; come to this California Deli, and 
you'll find that people are eating everything. 
</P>
<P>
This is a place that feeds California hungers. In what might be the supreme 
irony, this deli serves the single best pork I've had in a local restaurant: 
moist, sweet, tender honey-rosemary pork that is cooked on the rotisserie. 
Another irony: the only two dishes that I really didn't like were blintzes with 
a soupy filling that seemed a poor substitute for the pride of the Jewish 
kitchen -- and matzo ball soup that would make any Jewish mother wince. The 
soup was fine but the matzo balls were leaden. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the food here should not come a big surprise. It is the 
brainchild of Bruce Marder (West Beach Cafe, Rebecca's, DC 3), Michel Richard 
(Citrus) and veteran restaurant investor Marvin Zeidler. Although tensions 
between the three are reportedly high (one kitchen source says that serving 
three masters is impossible), they are all imaginative men who care deeply 
about food. 
</P>
<P>
You can see this for yourself in the shop in front -- which stocks all manner 
of wonderful food. One of the best small cheese selections in the city. An 
encyclopedic collection of dried pastas. Three kinds of anchovies. Six kinds of 
prosciutto. Nine kinds of ham. Jodi Maroni sausages. Produce so perfect it 
tends to look fake (including beautiful earth-filled baskets of salad that is 
still alive.) 
</P>
<P>
The deli bakes its own bread (the peasant bread is very good). It makes its own 
pastries -- eclairs, tirami su, lemon meringue tarts. Look in the dessert case, 
however, and you'll find one thing missing. It must be deliberate. This is a 
California deli -- and they don't do cheesecake.

NOTEBOOK: ENCINO LOSES LALO AND BROTHERS, ABRUPTLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Encino's Lalo and Brothers was mentioned in this column, in 
mid-May, it was to note that restaurant consultant Debbie Slutsky had been 
working with owner Lalo Durazo to help convert part of its floor space into a 
lower-priced cafe with a bistro menu. It was supposed to be called Cafe 
Veranda. The establishment also planned to change the name of the main dining 
room to Lalo's Restaurant, Bar &amp; Grill, and update the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Things are indeed different at Lalo's today: The restaurant has abruptly closed 
its doors. During the remodeling, Durazo told me recently, he had tried to 
renegotiate his lease, feeling that the rent he was paying was above market 
value. When this proved impossible, he said, "we just didn't see a profitable 
future for the restaurant anymore, and decided to close while we explore other 
possibilities in the same neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, noted Durazo, he has been working with partner Jaime Garcia Arteaga 
on an oceanfront resort and condominium project 27 miles south of the 
California border in Baja California. Called Club Marena, the complex will, 
Durazo said, "soon have a food and beverage operation to match the best of 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
GRILL TALK: Doug Delfeld is well-known to local restaurant-goers as a founding 
partner and manager of Trumps in West Hollywood, and as a founding and managing 
partner of Opera (now Opera on Ocean) in Santa Monica. But now he's severed all 
ties with those two establishments. His new position: general manager of the 
Grill in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to Grill co-owner Bob Spivak, Delfeld will have complete operational 
responsibilities for the restaurant. "It's the same kind of position I held at 
Trumps for eight years," Delfeld says. "I've always liked the Grill, and Bob 
and I both seem to function in about the same way, so I feel very comfortable 
coming here." No significant changes in the restaurant are planned. "But I'll 
be using a critical eye and looking for things I can improve upon," Delfeld 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Spivak will remain involved with the Grill, but is devoting most of his 
energies to opening more units in his popular, casual Daily Grill chain -- 
including one in Newport Beach this December, and another in Studio City next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
ALL OVER NOTES: Jonathan Waxman, who may be the most famous 
chef-without-a-restaurant in the country today, has set up the kitchen and 
created the menu at New York-based developer Harley Baldwin's new Caribou Club 
in Aspen and continues to oversee the club's food service on a consultative 
basis. The club, which is private, counts Martina Navratilova, John Denver and 
Michael Douglas among its founding members . . . Sharon and Grant Showley, 
whose Showley/Wrighton restaurant in Newport Beach closed in May, have moved 
north to take over Miramonte in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena. Miramonte's 
former proprietors, Tom Ash and Udo Nechutnys (now chef at the nearby Auberge 
de Soleil) closed the restaurant in January . . . After seven years of serving 
dinner from a prix fixe menu only, Stephan Pyles, chef and co-owner of the 
acclaimed Routh Street Cafe in Dallas, has gone a la carte -- after having 
found, he says, that the fixed-menu format was "thwarting creativity" . . . 
Chicago's famous "rock 'n' roll McDonald's" on the corner of Clark and Ohio 
streets, the first unit of the chain to stay open 24 hours and the first to 
develop and merchandise a non-company-generated theme (rock memorabilia), has 
just become the first McDonald's to offer pizza home delivery. (McDonald's has 
been test-marketing pizza in numerous locations around the U.S.) . . . And the 
British press reports that rising costs of cod and haddock -- fish 
traditionally used for fish and chips -- might prompt some purveyors of this 
famous English dish to switch to farm-raised salmon (of which there is now a 
glut on the market) instead. The fish-and-chip boys are skeptical, but 
apparently willing to try the new (to them) product. Ironically, though, 
British salmon farmers think it's a lousy idea. "I do not think the 
fish-and-chip image is one we would welcome," said William Crow, chief 
executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Assn. Most farm-raised salmon now 
sold in the British Isles, it might be noted, comes from Norway.

VIVE LA CONFUSION: Nation's Restaurant News reported recently that Le 
Cochonnet, a French restaurant in Chicago, would highlight the food of three 
Mediterranean regions of France this summer: Provence, Languedoc, and 
Ile-de-France. The only trouble is that the Ile-de-France, its name 
("Island-of-France") notwithstanding, is in north-central France, surrounding 
Paris, at least 300 miles from the Med . . . The Marina Bistro in Marina del 
Rey has introduced an "a la carte prix fixe" menu -- which certainly seems to 
cover all the bases. (In fact, the menu is prix fixe and not a la carte: $22 
for three courses of mostly traditional French food) . . . And in the 
department of promiscuous culinary cross-pollination, it is my duty to report 
that Aesop's Tables in La Jolla -- which is in trouble enough already just for 
that name -- has added "pitza" to its menu. Pitza, of course, is pita bread 
under Greek-style toppings in the manner of pizza. One variety includes lamb 
sausage, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, walnuts and red onions; another is made 
with shrimp and sun-dried tomatoes. All are said to be "nuzzled on top of 
homemade tomato sauce."

DO MOVIES PERVERT THE DEFINITION OF ART . . . OR DO THEY OFFER A MAGIC THAT 
SAVES US? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having watched TV coverage of this summer's "blockbuster" movies, I sit shaking 
my head at how simple-minded the moviegoing public has become. Each summer we 
get several sequels to the box office hits of summers past -- the same plot in 
a new setting with supposedly bigger and better blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer it was "Lethal Weapon 2" featuring the same scenes (Mel jumps off a 
building again, Mel acts crazy again, Mel destroys a house with his pickup -- 
new but stupid). 
</P>
<P>
This summer it was "Another 48 HRS.," "Die Hard 2," etc. -- same plot, new 
settings . . . perhaps fun with your brain in reverse but beyond belief. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, at least in the first three James Bond pictures, the plots were 
different and the villains interesting. Everyone who has ever seen "Goldfinger" 
remembers Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob. But over the years who remembers the 
villains of "For Your Eyes Only" or "Octopussy"? 
</P>
<P>
Sequels merely rehash what we found out in the original (the exception being 
"Godfather II"). 
</P>
<P>
With the X-rating problem, which is hurting many small creative films and 
prompting the mind-set of having to spend megabucks on making a film, I see 
fewer and fewer "little" films and less creative and risky projects. I'm not 
sure that a Woody Allen could break into Hollywood today. And wouldn't that be 
a loss?

LIMITS ON FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter below rebuts letter writer Steven Grant's Aug. 12 defense of the 
free-speech rights of controversial public figures such as comedians Sam 
Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay and members of the Guns N' Roses and Public Enemy 
bands. Grant argued that "too many times in America's history, (the right of 
free speech) was abrogated because whoever was speaking wasn't politically 
correct enough for whoever was defining political correctness at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant may be unaware that the U.S. Supreme Court, which interprets our laws 
and Constitution, has carved out exceptions to absolute free speech: "The most 
stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting 
fire in a theater and causing a panic" (1919). 
</P>
<P>
And, like it or not, obscene material is not protected by free-speech rights 
(1957). 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, some forms of offensive speech, like "fighting words" are not beyond 
restrictions. In upholding the "fighting words" doctrine, the court ruled in 
1942 that words "which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite 
an immediate breach of peace" may be purged from public dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
To be called nigger, faggot, spic or kike might leave more enduring scars than 
a physical assault. 
</P>
<P>
How we draw the line in today's climate of increasing racial, sexual and ethnic 
insults may not be easy, but no one can say that speech is absolutely "free."

YES, SOME DO HATE IMPRESSIONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Christopher Knight's Aug. 12 commentary, "Lasting Favorable Impressions": 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mr. Knight, there is someone who loathes the Impressionists. I hate the 
bright colors that look like they are straight out of the tube, I hate the 
childish, unfinished look, I hate the myopic fuzziness, I hate what 
Impressionism developed into in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all I hate the media dictators of the last 40 years who have made 
the Impressionists into everlasting images of the "avant-garde" and untouchable 
cultural icons. Well, I'm an iconoclast! 
</P>
<P>
How can one decide what his favorite art is when the options presented are so 
limited? People do not know that they are kept from non-approved art because 
they have never been allowed to see for themselves, or they have been told this 
is what the Impressionists were revolting against and therefore it must be bad 
art. 
</P>
<P>
When I mention the names of the artists I think are great, I am met with two 
responses: (1) "I never heard of them -- how good could they be?" or (2) 
"They're trash, because that is what everybody believes." The names: Ingres, 
Ama-Tadema, Tissot, Winterhalter, Parrish (yes, Maxfield Parrish!). The artists 
I revere could take reality and better it -- they could make the casual 
observer see what he frequently missed in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of art-conscious people believe as they've been taught -- that it 
isn't art if it isn't fuzzy and indistinct. There are a tiny few of us who 
think for ourselves.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / A. GARY SHILLING: SHIFT BY FED MAY PREVENT TAXES 
FROM BEING RAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. GARY SHILLING, A. GARY SHILLING is president of A. Gary Shilling &amp; 
Co., economic consultants and asset managers. His firm publishes Insight, a 
monthly newsletter covering the business outlook and investment strategy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has admitted in congressional 
testimony that the credit crunch -- previously claimed by the Fed to be 
nonexistent -- is serious enough to warrant some monetary ease. In so doing, he 
may have prevented Congress and the Administration from introducing a level of 
fiscal restraint that would have driven the U.S. economy right into the mud. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed shift could also prompt Congress to rethink its position on new taxes, 
reasoning that if the Fed -- which has been maintaining firm credit to fight 
inflation -- is suddenly more concerned about the health of the economy, this 
is no time to depress things further by raising taxes and cutting federal 
outlays. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan is no doubt worried about progressive weakness in interest-sensitive 
sectors of the economy, but is also under excruciating pressure from the Bush 
Administration and Republicans in Congress who fret over the depressing 
economic effects of the ongoing credit crunch and high interest rates, 
especially in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration and Congress have also been feeling the weight of the 
rapidly growing federal deficit. Spending has been soaring even without the 
savings and loan bailout costs, and that crisis has added additional hefty 
poundage to outlays. Furthermore, the softening economy has cut revenue, 
especially corporate income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The growing deficit raises the specter of huge Gramm-Rudman-required spending 
cuts. The automatic spending cuts needed to get from a $232-billion deficit to 
a $74-billion deficit would devastate the pet programs of both Congress and the 
Administration. Any deficit reduction program that would avoid the chaos of 
those spending slashes would be most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite the pressure to reduce the deficit, Washington just doesn't 
have a habit of raising taxes -- especially individual income taxes -- or 
cutting spending in election years. There are lots or reasons to suspect, then, 
that there will be no meaningful deficit-reduction measures enacted, at least 
not this year. 
</P>
<P>
But, you're thinking, then the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts would be automatic, 
and Washington can't stand by and watch about $150 billion hacked out of 
favorite programs. There are, however, escape clauses in the Gramm-Rudman law 
that might come into play and rescue the lawmakers and the President. 
</P>
<P>
If real gross national product is reported to have grown less than 1% at annual 
rates for two consecutive quarters, or if the Administration estimates that 
real GNP will decline for two consecutive quarters, then Congress can pass, and 
the President can sign, a joint resolution suspending Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady -- although still arguing that the United 
States can avoid a recession -- recently said the Middle East crisis could cut 
the real economic growth rate to 0.75% in the second half of this year. Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait gives the Administration another reason to suspend 
Gramm-Rudman. The Administration has already exercised its option -- citing 
national security -- to exempt military personnel accounts from any 
across-the-board spending cuts this year. 
</P>
<P>
An unlikely alternative would be for Congress and the Administration to 
actually raise taxes and cut spending to the tune of the $50 billion they've 
been discussing, despite all the drawbacks. This would be far and away the 
biggest package of fiscal restraint in U.S. history, but would still not bring 
a projected deficit of more than $200 billion in fiscal 1991 down to the 
required $74-billion level. And, that $200-billion-plus figure would be a gross 
underestimate if, as I expect, the U.S. economy is already in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the experience of postwar recessions, an average downturn would 
increase the current deficit by $125 billion -- bringing it close to $300 
billion -- even if taxes were not cut or real spending increased in response to 
business weakness. With a deep recession, the red ink could reach $350 billion 
or even $400 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has experience dealing with such huge gaps between projected deficits 
and Gramm-Rudman requirements -- they simply change the law. There is already 
agreement by both Republicans and Democrats to remove the huge S&amp;L bailout 
costs from the budget and to also exclude the large surpluses piling up in the 
Social Security trust fund. The Middle East conflict could provide the 
rationale to exempt defense spending from deficit ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
Although far short of the amount of fiscal restraint required by the current 
Gramm-Rudman law, $50 billion or perhaps even less in spending cuts might be 
enough to turn an unfolding recession into something considerably deeper. Even 
though the Fed would be easing credit in response to genuine fiscal restraint, 
and later dumping money out of airplanes to counteract financial crises and a 
serious recession, the monetary authorities' actions, as usual, would come too 
late to arrest the bulk of the downward course of business. 
</P>
<P>
This prospect is intensified by the similarities between today's world and that 
of the early 1930s. Then, as now, the debt-ridden consumer was paying the price 
of years of growth, available credit had dried up, foreign debtors were 
struggling to service their loans, the Fed was worried about inflation and the 
Administration was concerned about a growing budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the Depression, both the Administration and the Fed 
responded with appropriate stimulating measures: President Herbert Hoover and 
Congress agreed on a temporary tax cut, Hoover persuaded major businesses to 
maintain current wage levels (Henry Ford actually raised wages from his 
celebrated $5 a day to $7 a day) and the Fed cut the discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
However, by 1931, businesses could no longer maintain their wage promises, and 
the budget was running a $1-billion deficit. The tax cut of 1929 was not 
renewed, and tax rates returned to their original levels. In June, 1932, only 
weeks before the Democratic and Republican national conventions (both parties' 
presidential candidates were calling for a balanced budget), Congress and 
Hoover agreed on a new tax proposal. That more than doubled the basic income 
tax rates, increased other taxes and reduced exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
This fiscal policy certainly didn't eliminate the deficit, which jumped to $3.3 
billion in 1934 from $2.6 billion in 1933. At the same time, the economy's 
slide accelerated, the fall in real GNP going from an annual decline of 6.6% 
between the third quarter of 1930 and the third quarter of 1931, to an 
annualized drop of 15% from the third quarter of 1931 to the same quarter of 
1933. 
</P>
<P>
A tax increase now could result in a sequel to the 1930s -- a classic case of 
the wrong policy at the wrong time. Fortunately, both Congress and the 
Administration have a few ways to get around imposing one.

2 MEASURES PROVIDE AMMUNITION IN U.S. CAMPAIGN AGAINST ILLITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time to go back to school. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee says 23 
million Americans are illiterate. Another 45 million adults read with only 
minimal comprehension. Jonathan Kozol, author of "Illiterate America," 
estimates that the United States ranks 49th among the 158 nations in the United 
Nations in literacy level. And it's getting worse: 
</P>
<P>
* New York Telephone Co. had to give an entry-level exam to 60,000 people to 
hire just 3,000 because 84% failed the test. 
</P>
<P>
* Chemical Bank in New York interviews 40 applicants to find one who can be 
trained successfully as a teller. 
</P>
<P>
* Chrysler Corp. had to incorporate graphics on its assembly line because so 
many workers could not read the words bad hood fit on the button they were 
supposed to push when they detected an ill-fitting body part. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't read, write and do basic math, you just cannot be a truly 
productive American. It's just that simple," said Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio), who 
is the primary sponsor of the "literacy for all Americans act." 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer made the statement standing behind a low wall of books representing the 
465,000 pages of technical data that an automobile mechanic must be able to 
read to diagnose and repair cars. "This wall between good people and good jobs 
must come down," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
A worker who lacks basic skills to keep up with change in the increasingly 
complex work environment -- who can't read basic instruction manuals or safety 
instructions -- drops farther and farther behind. And low-level opportunities 
are disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"American jobs are placing greater demands on employees," said the Senate Labor 
Committee report. "The average American worker today must have skills at the 
ninth-grade through the 12th-grade levels, not the fourth-grade level typical 
after World War II. And the standards keep rising. The growth occupations have 
increasingly shifted to the service and retail sectors, which require 
high-level problem solving, communication, reading, writing and math skills." 
</P>
<P>
Without a federal initiative on literacy, these workers will be more vulnerable 
to a shift or advance in the marketplace, be confined to dead-end jobs or 
always be in danger of dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and the nation's governors have embraced a new national policy 
calling for every American to be literate by the year 2000. To that end, two 
major literacy bills are on the verge of final congressional approval this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer's bill is part of the omnibus "equity and excellence in education act" 
(H.R. 5115) sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). The House 
approved it overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) sponsored the Senate counterpart, the National 
Literacy Act of 1990 (S. 1310), which passed unanimously. The bills' 
differences will be ironed out in a conference committee this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The main federal program to fight illiteracy today is the Adult Education Act, 
which is funded at $160 million, less than 1% of the Department of Education's 
budget. Sawyer's bill calls for an additional $250 million, Simon's for an 
additional $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of both bills is to provide federal leadership and focus for an 
issue dominated by fragmented state and local efforts. It would create the 
federal infrastructure to coordinate and strengthen efforts at all levels. And 
it would provide incentives for the private sector to become more involved. 
</P>
<P>
The bills would create a national center for literacy to write national 
educational goals, develop better teaching methods and tools and train 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But while Simon's bill focuses more on the unemployed person who can't read, 
Sawyer's bill concentrates on the functionally illiterate employed worker. His 
bill would establish a National Workplace Literacy Assistance Collaborative to 
help small and medium-sized businesses and labor organizations implement 
special programs through a system of grants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tremendously important to upgrade the skills of today's work force," said 
Harold W. McGraw, president of the Business Council for Effective Literacy, 
"not only in terms of our own profitability and ability to compete 
internationally, but also in terms of giving workers new opportunities. There 
are less and less low-level jobs out there today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Would Let U.S. Firms Recruit Aliens 
</P>
<P>
New employment-based immigration laws could open doors to the U.S. job market 
for foreign recruits while providing money to educate and retrain American 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs are going begging in the current economy, said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison 
(D-Conn.), primary sponsor of the "family unity and employment opportunity 
immigration act" (H.R. 4300). 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the quota system used under current law, Morrison proposes awarding 
visas to people overseas with relatives already in the United States. This 
system would allow employers to recruit workers from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison proposes a head tax, of sorts. After attempting to find workers in 
this country, companies would be allowed to recruit immigrants -- for a fee. 
Companies with 200 or more employees would pay $1,000 per worker; companies 
with 50 to 200 employees would pay $500. There would be no fee for companies 
with fewer than 50 employees or for nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The money would go to the American Workers' Educational Trust Fund, which the 
secretary of Labor could use to provide education grants to states. 
</P>
<P>
"By balancing the benefits to employers who recruit immigrants to fill jobs 
with raising revenues to educate and train American workers for the jobs of the 
future, we will have built a system of employer-based immigration where 
everybody wins -- the immigrant, the employer and the American worker," 
Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has passed the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to come 
to the floor for a vote when Congress returns from summer recess. The Bush 
Administration favors similar, although narrower, legislation passed by the 
Senate last year.

MONEY TALK: HOW TO OBTAIN PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM IRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: My wife and I have a financial situation that we believe conforms to the 
facts covered in a private letter ruling received by another set of taxpayers. 
We would like a similar decision and have been advised that we need to get our 
own private ruling. How do we do this? Is there a specific form that the 
Internal Revenue Service provides? Does an attorney have to handle this or can 
we do it ourselves? -- J.F.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: The IRS does not provide a specific form. The process you must follow to get 
a private letter ruling is spelled out in various "Revenue Procedures," a 
regular feature in the IRS's Cumulative Bulletin, a weekly publication 
available in most law libraries. Typically, the first revenue procedure 
published each year lists the necessary information. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is more. Depending on the type of ruling you want, you must 
submit supporting documents and materials that deal with your particular issue. 
These are published in yet other Cumulative Bulletins. Some of these bulletins 
could be a few years old; some will be recent. The revenue procedure that 
applies to your case will tell you to which branch of the IRS national office 
you should send your private letter ruling request. Another source of IRS 
procedures is IRS Regulation 601, the statement of procedural rules. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, the IRS did not charge for private rulings. However, 
when its mailbox began bulging with requests, fees were imposed. Currently, 
fees range from a few hundred dollars for determinations on simple matters to 
as much as $2,500 for complex issues. A revenue procedure will list the fee. In 
addition, there are attorney fees to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Could you handle this by yourself? Possibly. But it might be time-consuming and 
complicated. However, if you know that the IRS has already issued a private 
letter ruling similar to one that you want, your task could be easier. You 
would be wise to submit a copy of the first ruling with the other materials 
required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widower Can Take One-Time Exemption 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I owned our home as joint tenants between 1959 and her death in 
1982. I took sole title to the house in 1987. I sold it in 1990. I am 67. My 
understanding is that I am not eligible for the $125,000 one-time exemption on 
the profit from the sale because my wife, having died eight years ago, did not 
satisfy the requirement of living in the house for three of the last five 
years. But it didn't really matter because I bought a new house for much more. 
But now, will I be able to take advantage of the exemption when I sell the new 
house? My deceased spouse obviously does not satisfy the holding and use 
requirement. -- R.T.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: First, you could have taken advantage of the profit exemption this year when 
you sold your house, even if your deceased wife could not meet the eligibility 
requirements. She didn't have to -- only you did. The same applies to your 
current house. So long as you meet the requirements -- you are at least 55, you 
have lived in the house three of the last five years and the house is your 
principal residence -- you are entitled to it. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: If you remarry and your new wife has already taken advantage of the 
exemption -- it doesn't matter if it was with another spouse -- your 
eligibility is lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate Can Be Considered a Gift 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own property in New Hampshire. My uncle owns 10 acres adjacent to mine and 
is considering selling it. He has agreed to give me approximately 0.6 acres as 
a buffer zone. One acre has been appraised at $15,000, which is considerably 
more than the property was worth when he inherited it from our grandfather. Can 
land be considered a gift and given tax-free if it is valued at less than 
$10,000? Do I have to pay any tax other than increased property taxes to the 
county? What is the paperwork needed to handle this transaction? -- D.E.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, land can be given as a gift if it meets the gift-tax value standards. 
And with only one exception, your uncle will not be required to pay capital 
gains on the property, despite its considerable appreciation. The only 
exception would crop up if your uncle passed on debt with the property that 
exceeded his tax basis in it. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how that situation might work: Let's say that when the donor (your 
uncle) originally got the property from your grandfather, it was worth $500 per 
acre. As the land appreciated, your uncle mortgaged it to the tune of $10,000 
per acre. If he owes more than $500 per acre on the land when he gives it to 
you -- and you agree to assume the debt -- the donor is considered to have a 
taxable gain to the extent that the debt he passes on exceeds his taxable basis 
in the property. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what happens to the donor, you have no income tax obligation to 
the federal government. To complete the transaction, you can simply file a 
grant deed in the local New Hampshire county recorder's office, detailing the 
legal description of the property that is being given to you. You do not need 
to note the gift on your income tax filing. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's column on Social Security benefits available to divorced spouses 
left the wrong impression about a divorced spouse's eligibility for full 
widow's or widower's benefits upon the death of the wage earner. A divorced 
spouse may begin drawing benefits at 60, but he or she will receive only 71.5% 
of what the wage earner would have received. The percentage increases gradually 
until it hits 100% when the ex-spouse reaches 65.

ERMA BOMBECK: INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF MOTHERS IS STILL GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There isn't a mother alive who doesn't empathize with Maria Gorbachev, who, 
during a recent interview, complained that her son, Mikhail, had not visited 
her in 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so the kid is up to his armpits in earthquakes, nuclear disaster, the 
threat of a unified Germany, civil revolutions, and Soviets fighting to leave 
the country. Not to mention the trouble he's having at the office and the 
shouting match between Raisa and Nancy that made the front pages. But is any 
one of them a reason not to call? 
</P>
<P>
Somehow it's comforting to know that Russian mothers engage in the practice of 
"glasguilt." We do have something in common. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to be a third-generation guilt-spreader -- maybe further back than 
that. But I can remember my grandmother (who could freeze-dry coffee with one 
look) saying, "I called you yesterday, but you knew it was me and you wouldn't 
answer the phone." 
</P>
<P>
My mother phones daily to ask, "Did you just try to reach me?" When I reply, 
"No," she adds, "So, if you're not too busy, call me while I'm still alive," 
and hangs up. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't done as good a job with guilt as my mother and grandmother. The 
reason for this is answering machines. My children dial my number when they 
know I am not at home. When I ask them why they never call, they say it is my 
fault for not having an answering machine. I wouldn't give them the 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
I hate their answering devices. It is true that these machines are generally 
more polite than my kids, but I have never worked well under pressure. When a 
recording tells me I have just a few seconds to leave a message, I choke. 
Sometimes I just say, "Make me a grandmother" and hang up. The one that always 
gets their attention is, "You're out of the will if you don't return my call by 
-- " and then I break the connection. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maria Gorbachev, her son's visit in 1987 lasted just 40 minutes. 
Big deal. That's hardly enough time to remind him how long she was in labor 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a guess, but I suspect the entire time was spent listening to Maria's 
monologues on the following topics: "So, Mr. Big Shot, how come you never 
called? KGB got your tongue?"; "I might as well live in Siberia for all you 
care"; "You think you can replace my black-and-white TV with a color set and 
you won't have to bother with me"; "Oh sure, I could move to Moscow. Maybe 
you'd visit me in the bread line," and "I'm glad your father is not here to see 
how you treat your mother like a peasant." 
</P>
<P>
The woman has style. If Pravda's wire service doesn't get her son's attention, 
there's always "60 Minutes," Sally Jessy Raphael, Maury Povich. . . .

ON VIEW: DARE BEATS DRUMS FOR BENEFIT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Structure it right, and you can make $1 million. At least, that's the intent of 
Bruce A. Meyer, president of Geary's and chairman of the Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education fund-raiser Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
He's got a fighting chance; last year's DARE benefit raised $850,000. This year 
it has nabbed the opening night concert by Chicago (80 million albums sold) at 
the Universal Amphitheatre and will couple it with a gala dinner. 
</P>
<P>
DARE has become such a well-known byword nationally, it's easy to forget it was 
founded right here in Los Angeles by the Los Angeles Police Department and the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. It places a specially trained police 
officer in fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms for a 17-week semester to teach 
students how to refuse drugs and alcohol and follows up with junior and high 
school classes. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer promises that every dollar contributed to the cause will go straight to 
the classroom to foster drug awareness for both students and parents. Columbia 
Savings Charitable Foundation will underwrite the event. 
</P>
<P>
STAR-STUDDED: The CEO of Dior, Madame Beatrice Bongibault-Dhjan, is opening the 
first major Dior boutique in America Sept. 12 at the new Two Rodeo Drive 
complex in Beverly Hills, and Wendy Goldberg, Lili Zanuck and Nancy Vreeland 
have been picked to co-host the gala arrival. It should be a social highlight: 
The streets of Rodeo Drive will be lined with 50 top models wearing the best of 
the Dior 1990-91 collection. The New York boutique will open in November. The 
Beverly Hills boutique will mirror the company's Avenue Montaigne Paris 
headquarters with the same canopied beveled glass door and signature dove-gray 
and white colors on Louis XVI-style furniture. After the cocktail opening, 
Madame Bongibault will host a dinner at the Bistro Garden. 
</P>
<P>
BRAND NEW: With the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the Associates of 
the California Institute of Technology and the upcoming Caltech centennial in 
1991, the board of directors of the Associates has voted to form a new 
membership classification for individuals under 40. Two dynamos -- Gordon 
Pashgian and Joe Regan, both Associates board members -- lead the young group. 
First event is Sept. 22. Members will take their youngsters on a tour of the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and follow with hot dogs and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
NEW CHAIR: CONCERN II's big concern is funding children's cancer research in 
the area of immunology. Since 1981 it has raised $1.7 million. Now, members 
announce they'll establish their first research chair at Childrens Hospital of 
Los Angeles (in 1986 they founded the brain tumor research laboratory there). 
Thus, they're gung-ho on their biggest fund-raiser ever Sept. 15 at Cary Grant 
Pavilion at Hollywood Park. Event chairs Barry and Sue Brucker and David and 
Connie Oliver, and a committee including Pam Roberts, Ruthie Katz, Marla 
Duboff, Dan Furie, Nancy Powell and Debbie Hovesepian, have designed a 
futuristic evening of scrip wagering on taped horse races, plus a casino, 
international buffet, dancing and a grand prize trip for two to Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
CARLA: U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills will be back in her hometown 
here Sept. 6 to address the Los Angeles World Affairs Council on "America's 
Trade Agenda." 
</P>
<P>
KIDS: The Kids Benefit Committee is introducing its inaugural Christmas and 
holiday card line. The cards are designed by children who are patients at UCLA 
Medical Center and suffer from life-threatening illnesses. Josselyn McAdam, 
benefit chair, and Susan Armistead 
</P>
<P>
are pushing the effort. Personalizing is also available; order at (213) 
206-6032. 
</P>
<P>
THE CIRCUIT: Couturiere Pauline Trigere was the center of the Champagne 
reception launching her fall collection at I. Magnin in Beverly Hills last 
week. . . . Metropolitan Associates hosted its final evening of movies and 
picnic suppers last week, raising funds for opera performances for children at 
the Music Center and for in-school performances. Garden hosts this summer have 
been Mary Kay and Boyd Hight, Nadine and Bob Skotheim, Joan and Jim Caillouette 
and Alicia and Ed Clark. . . . Lawrence and Julianne Feuerhelm hosted the 
silvery moon waltz party for National Charity League of San Fernando Valley 
debutantes and their fathers. Now everyone's in step for the Nov. 24 ball at 
the Beverly Wilshire. . . . Bridge aficionados were in quartets led by Marilyn 
Burdge by early morning at the Bel Air Bay Club this week for Angels Attic's 
summer bridge luncheon featuring George Winter and "My Best Bids." 
</P>
<P>
AT CHECKERS: Maestro Gerard Schwarz of the Seattle Symphony and former head of 
the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra was the focus along with his 125 musicians 
for a cocktail reception at Checkers Hotel hosted by DELOS International Inc., 
the Seattle Symphony's recording company, and Checkers. The Seattle orchestra, 
at the Hollywood Bowl last week for three nights, was welcomed by donors, 
including Don Mullane of BankAmerica Foundation and Eugene R. Wilson, president 
of Arco Foundation.

PARALYZED IN 'THE INCIDENT,' OFFICER FIGHTS TO WALK AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Johnston remembers "the incident" in vivid detail. 
</P>
<P>
It was a routine call last January to investigate a forgery attempt at the 
Security Pacific Bank in El Monte. "It's not the sort of call on which you'd 
expect violence," the El Monte police officer said. 
</P>
<P>
A husky man with rust-colored hair, Johnston spotted the suspect from the 
bank's foyer. "I saw him turn and look at me, with a real nervous, excited look 
on his face," Johnston recalled. "He immediately started walking towards me." 
</P>
<P>
Using a bank customer as a shield, the suspect pulled a handgun from his belt 
and headed for the door. "I couldn't shoot because the other man was in the 
way," Johnston said. "With my left hand, I pushed the customer out of the way. 
At that exact moment, I got shot." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fired three times, hitting Johnston once in the throat and blasting 
the bank's glass door to smithereens. "I was lying there and it seemed like 
forever that the glass was falling on me." 
</P>
<P>
"The incident" -- as he and his wife, Ruth, sometimes numbly refer to the 
shooting -- thrust Johnston into a nightmare world, with the veteran police 
officer facing the very real possibility that he would spend the rest of his 
life in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the chest down and unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Newly married, an amateur drummer with the rich baritone of a disc jockey, a 
cop who had volunteered long hours to provide encouragement to needy El Monte 
children, Johnston was suddenly a paraplegic who needed the assistance of two 
men to carry him to his second-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The last seven months have been a roller-coaster ride for the Johnstons, from 
the first awful words of a County/USC Medical Center neurologist telling them 
that Johnston would never walk again to the moment, a month later, when 
Johnston succeeded in moving his big toe, producing a twitching motion so faint 
that his wife had to bend close to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I woke up the whole hospital wing when that happened," Ruth Johnston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Johnston, 35, has defied the early prognoses, teaching himself to 
talk in the raspy voice of movie character "Freddy Krueger" despite a shattered 
larynx and, through a regimen of laborious exercises, learning how to walk 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Johnston can maneuver down a sidewalk with a walker or two canes -- at 13% 
of normal speed, according to his therapists -- and he has walked up to 545 
feet without pausing. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's the fight of my life," Johnston said last week, pausing 
briefly from a grueling series of leg exercises in the gym at Casa Colina, a 
rehabilitation hospital in Pomona. "Every bead of sweat takes me one step 
closer to my goal" of being able to walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the worst eventu-alities produce their own rewards -- good deeds from 
strangers and richer relationships with loved ones. Johnston has been the 
object of an outpouring of generosity from El Monte residents, who raised -- 
through banquets, car washes and a truck raffle -- enough money for a down 
payment on a house in Rialto, where the Johnstons now live. 
</P>
<P>
He received a Congressional Award of Merit and, recently, the R. G. Canning 
California Officer of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a real inspiration to all of us," said El Monte Police Chief Wayne 
Clayton, who presented the Canning award two weeks ago in a Rose Bowl ceremony. 
Johnston "no doubt saved a man's life" when he pushed bank customer John Flores 
out of the line of fire, Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of courage," said Flores, 54, of El Monte, a clerk with the 
county assessor's office. "I would have run in the opposite direction." 
</P>
<P>
The injury also produced a deep, spiritual relationship with Ruth Johnston, 
whom he had married just four months before he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old legal secretary still weeps bitterly when she recalls the first 
sight of her husband on an emergency room gurney. "When they finally let me in 
to see him, it was a shock," she said haltingly. "His whole body was bouncing 
in the bed from the trauma and his eyes were wide open like this." She makes 
eyes wide and unblinking. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, certain he would die, managed to communicate his love to his wife. 
"Then we prayed together," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet had struck two vertebrae in Johnston's neck, leaving bone splinters 
lodged near the spinal cord. The resultant swelling left him paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"Telling a muscle to move and it won't -- that's very difficult to understand," 
said Johnston, whose alleged assailant, Nguyen Lu, was subsequently arrested 
and declared incompetent to stand trial. Lu, a 27-year-old Temple City man, is 
currently under observation at a state psychiatric facility. 
</P>
<P>
Therapists at Casa Colina painstakingly taught Johnston to transfer himself 
from bed to wheelchair, and how to shower and groom himself. Then, as it became 
apparent that he had sensation in his lower body, they began the arduous task 
of teaching him to walk. Johnston started on the parallel bars, dragging 
himself along for 30 feet with most of his weight resting on his arms, then he 
moved to the front-wheel walker. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a week now, he goes through his paces, maneuvering up a set of 
stairs in the Casa Colina gym or doing leg bends on a mat or just sitting down 
and standing up -- all under the cobra-like gaze of physical therapist Berni 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Here he is, face down on a mat, pumping his left leg slowly up and down, as 
Rogers goads him along like a bodybuilding trainer at Muscle Beach. "OK, Don," 
she said as Johnston winced with the effort. "Give me two more. Just two more." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers acknowledged that Johnston is often in pain. There is a chaotic welter 
of signals rushing through his legs. "His nervous system interprets something 
like this," she said, running one finger lightly over an arm, "as pain. It's as 
if your leg has fallen asleep and you're feeling that burning, tingly 
sensation. That's what Don feels all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But Rogers is optimistic. Six months down the road, she sees Johnston walking, 
perhaps with a cane, at 50% of the "normal" walking speed of 300 feet per 
minute. "He's young and healthy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured man already has defied expectations, said Dr. Tae-Soon Kim, his 
physiatrist. "He's made remarkable gains, well beyond initial expectations." 
But only about 2% of those with spinal cord injuries recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect him to progress further," Kim said, "but as far as full recovery, 
that remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston attributes his progress to his belief in God. "But you can't sit back 
and expect God to do all the work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The son of retired El Monte Detective Loren (Corky) Johnston, the injured man 
said he expects eventually to go back to the department -- "whether at a desk 
job or whatever." His son from a previous marriage, Eric, 14, wants to sign on 
too. "I want to follow in his footsteps," the youth said last week. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how far he progresses, Johnston has already traveled a vast distance 
from the time six months ago when he was a mute, troubled hospital patient, his 
wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Johnston recalls with crystal clarity the moment when the nightmare 
started to dissipate. As she rested in a hotel, doctors were removing a valve 
from Johnston's trachea. Until then, her only communication from her husband 
had been on a magnetized writing pad. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best phone call I ever got," she said. "There was this funny Freddy 
Krueger voice on the other end. I said, 'Who is this?' and he said: 'Hi, honey. 
I love you.' "

WEST COVINA PLAZA DEBUTS ITS NEW LOOK 
</P>

WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first fruits of a $120-million renovation and expansion of the Plaza at 
West Covina were unveiled last week in what city and business officials hope 
will be the dawning of a new era for the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The two-part project involves a redesign of the plaza's interior and the 
eventual addition of 40 stores to the facility, said Michael Shulman, a 
managing partner of the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Shulman said a May Co. department store will be the largest of the new 
businesses. May Centers Inc. of St. Louis bought a 15% partnership in the plaza 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase, a $40-million renovation, was begun in December and was 
completed this month, General Manager Gregory S. Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyer said the work, which included the installation of new carpeting, 
lighting, landscaping and the addition of 10 fast-food outlets, was done to 
keep the plaza competitive with other shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a brand new shopping center, for all intents and purposes," Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a new wing to house 40 additional stores will begin in January, 
Beyer said, and should be open by fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina City Manager Robert Fast said the renovation and expansion of the 
shopping center should help boost the city's income. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza currently generates about 15% of West Covina's sales tax revenues, or 
$1.2 million, Fast said. The city hopes to be taking in close to $2 million a 
year after the expansion is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza has 150 businesses, including JC Penney, The Broadway and Bullock's 
department stores, and takes in about $120 million annually, Beyer said.

ALTADENANS CITED FOR FIGHT AGAINST CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORETTA SCHERTZ KELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Altadena neighborhood group has won a state award for community organization 
against crime. 
</P>
<P>
The California Stop Crime Coalition, whose members are appointed by the 
governor, selected the Royce Street Neighborhood Watch for a Governor's Crime 
Prevention Award. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. John Samuel told the Altadena Town Council on Tuesday that the 
West Altadena street has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago," Samuel said, "Royce Street was ridden with crime and blatant drug 
dealing. It was called the worst street in the county." Today, he said, because 
of combined resident and department cleanup efforts, it's one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
The award will be presented to the Royce Street group at a banquet Sept. 21 in 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition will pass out Governor's Crime Prevention Awards in seven 
categories. In addition to the Royce Street group -- which won the top award in 
the community organization category -- several other Los Angeles County cities 
and individuals will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Lakewood will receive a Vehicle Theft Prevention award; Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. George Gascon will get a Law Enforcement Practitioner Award, and 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will take honors in the Alcohol and 
Drug Prevention category for its program entitled "Drugs, Pregnancy and You."

FOES SEEK VETO OF EXEMPTION TO AIRPORT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a bill exempting Los Angeles County from a new law aimed at 
controlling growth around California's airports are launching a last-ditch 
effort to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, the city of Los Angeles and an airport advisory panel plan to 
recommend a veto of the bill, which is bound for Deukmejian's desk after 
clearing the Assembly last week on a 51-18 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), would exempt the 
county from a 7-month-old law that puts teeth into statutes designed to ensure 
that new development is compatible with the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Without the exemption, far-reaching regulations could be placed on development 
near Los Angeles International Airport, as well as airports in other parts of 
the county, including La Verne, El Monte and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill to exempt Los Angeles County from the law say the county 
is special because the land around most of its airports is already densely 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
But foes of an exemption for Los Angeles County argue that regional airport 
planning is needed to promote air safety and minimize the exposure of homes and 
businesses to aircraft noise.

TIRE DEATH LAWSUIT SETTLED FOR $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 57-year-old school district employee from Pomona will be paid $500,000 as 
part of a settlement for the runaway tire accident that killed her husband last 
year on the Foothill Freeway near Duarte, attorneys said last week. 
</P>
<P>
James Countryman, 59, died of head injuries in the January, 1989, accident, 
which occurred when a tire flew off a tractor-trailer truck, bounced across the 
center divider and smashed through the windshield of his pickup truck as he 
headed home from work. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, Rowena Countryman, a part-time food services assistant in the Pomona 
Unified School District, alleged in a lawsuit that both the driver and the firm 
he was hauling for, Vernon Asphalt Material Co. of Irwindale, were liable for 
the damages. 
</P>
<P>
"No one was alleging malicious conduct," said Countryman's attorney, Lawrence 
S. Eisenberg. "But under California law, the owner and operator of a vehicle 
has an absolute duty to make sure they're driving a safe vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon Asphalt and George Byles, an independent trucker who was working for the 
firm on contract, agreed to the settlement Wednesday. They and their insurance 
companies will pay Countryman $79,000 in cash and place another $221,000 in an 
interest-bearing account that will ultimately provide her with $500,000 over 
her lifetime, said Vernon's attorney, Stephen T. Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
A claim against Johnny's Tire Service of Irwindale, which installed the tires 
on the truck, is pending. Countryman's suit contends faulty installation caused 
the lug bolts to fracture and the wheel to fly off. Trial has been scheduled 
for November in Pomona Superior Court.

THE SELLERS' NERVES ALSO FRAY AS HOMES GO MONTHS UNSOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buyers locked out of the Southland's pricey housing market aren't the only ones 
under stress: So are thousands of sellers who can't unload their homes because 
of the recent downturn in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten to the point where we can't even sleep at night," said Darryl 
Jackson, who has been trying to sell his three-bedroom, two-bath Fountain 
Valley house for nearly six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll toss and turn for hours, and finally my wife will turn to me and say, 
'Are you thinking about selling the house, too?' And this goes on, night after 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and his wife, Debbie, are suffering from what some realtors have dubbed 
the "home sellers' blues" -- a sad litany of frustration, anxiety, desperation 
and even anger. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tune that's being sung by hapless would-be sellers in many parts of 
Southern California, with backup vocals provided by millions of homeowners in 
depressed housing markets across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Sleeplessness. Headaches. Upset stomaches and -- as one would-be seller puts it 
-- "a general state of disorientation." Searching for a buyer in today's 
sluggish housing market can be like looking for the proverbial needle in the 
haystack. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about selling my place all the time," said Diane Bever, an 
advertising-sales assistant who has had her four-bedroom home in Whittier on 
the market for nearly nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it when I'm at work. I think about it when I'm cooking dinner. I 
think about it when I go to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all just sort of hovering there. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
Owners who put their homes on the market and then find no buyers feel many of 
the same emotions as a woman who, after much deliberation, decides to become a 
prostitute and then finds that no one will pay for her services. 
</P>
<P>
Sound crazy? The analogy comes from Dr. Joyce Brothers, perhaps America's 
best-known psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of soul-searching to put your home up for sale, just as it 
would to become a call girl," Brothers explained. "When you find out that 
nobody wants your home or that nobody wants your body, you're going to feel 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Brothers said, the psychological pain can feed on itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Your home isn't just your biggest investment, it's a reflection of yourself," 
she said. "When it doesn't sell, you start wondering about your taste, your 
business acumen, your judgment. It hits all the sore points, and pretty soon 
you're doubting yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Too often, the self-doubt and frustration can cause marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Frustrated sellers are angry at the world, and they want to place blame on 
somebody for their problems," said Irene Goldenberg, a family psychologist and 
professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take it out on your (potential) buyer, because then you'd never be 
able to sell your house. So you wind up taking it out on your spouse. After 
all, the person that's closest to you is the one that's easiest to kick." 
</P>
<P>
While even the strongest of marriages can be tested by a soft resale market, 
it's even worse when a couple doesn't get along when they first put the home up 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one couple that I had to keep physically separated or else they'd come 
to blows," remembers Temmy Walker, a veteran realtor and president of James R. 
Gary Real Estate in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"When an offer was made, I'd have them both come down to the office. I'd put 
one in the conference room and the other in my office, then I'd run from one 
room to the next to iron out problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going through a pretty nasty divorce, but the soft market sure 
didn't help matters. I honestly would wake up in the morning and half-expect a 
headline in the paper: 'Wife Guns Down Husband,' or vice-versa." 
</P>
<P>
One key to psychologically surviving the task of selling in a soft market is to 
know what you're getting into in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to realize that we're not in the kind of market that we were in a 
year or two ago," said Michelle Walman of Century 21/Horizon Properties in 
Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to price your home realistically, and you're going to 
have to realize that it could take weeks or months for it to sell. If you 
expect to sell it the first day you hold an open house, you're going to make 
yourself crazy." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA psychologist Goldenberg has another tip for would-be sellers trying to 
keep their sanity: Separate the things that you can control from the things 
that you can't. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Goldenberg said, a good start is to mentally acknowledge the fact 
that you can't dictate how many buyers are shopping in your neighborhood. Then 
focus on the items that you can influence -- like whether the house is clean, 
the yard is trimmed and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"This will give you a better sense of being in control of your life," 
Goldenberg explained. "You'll function better if you feel like you have some 
power over your future." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara and Ed Ross, who've had their newly renovated three-bedroom house in 
North Hollywood on the market for six months, said they've kept their sanity by 
staying in constant contact with their real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives us updates once or twice a week on how he's marketing the property 
and how many people have seen it," Barbara Ross said. "If he didn't let us know 
what's going on, we'd go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
"Nuts" is where Steve Gonzalez says he's going to go if he can't sell his 
four-bedroom house in Lancaster soon. 
</P>
<P>
He put the two-story home on the market a year ago for $199,000, then fired his 
real estate agent and took down his for-sale sign when he couldn't get any 
takers after six months had passed. 
</P>
<P>
Now the home is up for sale again, but for $20,000 less than his original 
asking price. Gonzalez hopes to make up for the difference by selling the 
property himself and avoiding the cost of using a realtor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a few lookers, but no takers," said Gonzalez, who restores classic 
cars for a living. "Sure, it's stressful -- I've lost a little sleep, and I get 
a little testy with my girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"But hey, look at the bright side: I've lost 15 pounds since I put this place 
up for sale a couple of months ago. Maybe stress isn't all bad."

STATE LAW SUPERSEDES CC&amp;RS BUDGET LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I question your statement in your July 29 column that the state law 
takes precedence over more restrictive controls in the association's legal 
documents (regarding the percentage of budget increase that is legal). 
</P>
<P>
The California Civil Code, Section 1366, limits the regular assessment increase 
to 20% "notwithstanding more restrictive limitations placed on the board by the 
governing documents." 
</P>
<P>
Our association's CC&amp;Rs limit the annual assessment increase imposed by the 
board to 10%. Since the CC&amp;Rs are a contract among the homeowners, I 
question if Section 1366 can nullify that contract. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a legal opinion supporting your statement? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Thank you for asking for clarification. You are not the only person who 
is confused by the wording of this law. The confusion arises because of a 
misunderstanding of the meaning of the word notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding is a legal term that means "in spite of" or "regardless of." 
My dictionary uses the following example: "He bought it notwithstanding the 
high price." 
</P>
<P>
James P. Lingl, an attorney in Camarillo, states that even the California 
Department of Real Estate's Common Interest Development Brochure errs in its 
explanation of limitations of the board's authority in this particular section 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Lingl appeared as an expert witness at the July 31 hearings conducted by the 
state Legislature's Assembly Select Committee on Common Interest Subdivisions. 
He pointed out this error during his testimony at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
I have attended many legal seminars where this section of the law was 
thoroughly explained by nationally recognized experts in the field of community 
association law. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I am not an attorney, I am certain that I can stand by my previous 
advice, which was: According to California law, the board has the right to 
impose a 20% increase over the prior year's regular assessment. The law takes 
precedence over more restrictive controls in your association's legal 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Must Pay Fee While Claim Unsettled 
</P>
<P>
Q: The board of directors of my 28-unit homeowners association has signed a 
contract with a company that is owned by the board president. 
</P>
<P>
This is just one example of the questionable decisions that are being made. I 
have asked to see copies of the minutes to find out if the whole board knows 
about the work that is being done. 
</P>
<P>
I told the president that until I found out how much money had been spent and 
received copies of the minutes, I would not pay my monthly assessments. That 
was over two months ago, so I now owe assessments for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Today I received a letter from the management company that says I have to pay 
my assessments or the association could place a lien on my unit. 
</P>
<P>
What are my rights? Do I have to pay my assessments even though the board is 
mismanaging the association's money? 
</P>
<P>
A: Though there appears to be a conflict of interest here, you must pay your 
assessments. I am sure that the declaration of your association will not allow 
you to stop paying just because you are dissatisfied with the board. Do not 
ignore the letter from the management company. 
</P>
<P>
You have the right to obtain the information that you requested. If your 
contact with the president was verbal, then write to the association board and 
send it to the management company along with your check for the unpaid 
assessments. Request a response by a specified date. 
</P>
<P>
While you are waiting for a response, contact some of the other board members 
to see what they know about the board president's company doing association 
work. It could be that the president is saving the association money. Perhaps 
there are competitive bids that will show that the president is doing the 
association a favor. 
</P>
<P>
If you feel that you already have enough information and that you are ready to 
confront the board, call the management company to find out when the next board 
meeting is scheduled. Then ask to have the matter placed on the agenda for the 
next board meeting. This also should be put in writing. 
</P>
<P>
If you are ignored, the only way to force the board or the management company 
to respond to your requests is to contact an attorney who can explain your 
options.

AT HOME: NORMAN ROCKWELL MEETS SINGLE SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
BELMONT SHORE: THIS PART OF LONG BEACH RECLAIMED FROM MARSHES IS HOME TO A 
DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF RENTERS AND OWNERS CONTENT WITH THE LIFESTYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER Times Staff Writer Mark Pinsky has lived 
in Belmont Shore for 5 years years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He took his time walking the two blocks home, stretching it out, listening to 
the quiet streets. It was just a little before midnight, but Tuesday was slow 
in Belmont Shore, everyone hunkered down, waiting for the weekend, when the 
bars offered two-for-one tequila shooters and dirty dancing contests. . . . His 
building was pink stucco -- what the classifieds call mission-style -- two 
stories of wrought-iron grillwork and decorative brick, rounded archways, and a 
red barrel-tile roof. It looked more like a Taco Bell than the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Ferrigno "The Horse Latitudes" 
</P>
<P>
There are two distinct communities in Belmont Shore, a conveniently located 
Long Beach neighborhood wedged between Alamitos Bay and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The better known of these -- thanks to resident Robert Ferrigno's hot new 
mystery -- is the fast-paced world of singles, renters and apartment dwellers, 
of night swimming in the bay and hanging out days on the nearby section of 
beach called "Horny Corners." 
</P>
<P>
"Single people rent down here because of the activity, the action," said Janie 
Smith, of Rene Realty. "Most of the renters are college students or people who 
can't afford to buy." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest concentration of apartments is at the edges of Shore, along the 
bay, the ocean and Livingston Avenue, with the rest sprinkled throughout the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But for many other Shore residents -- homeowners running the gamut from young 
families with children to two-career couples to retirees -- the friendly beach 
town is more like a California version of Norman Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Shore is the kind of community that gave Long Beach the nickname 
"Iowa-by-the-Sea," one that generates enough pride to produce its own post 
cards, bumper stickers and license plate frames.

"There are two Belmont Shores," conceded author Ferrigno, who moved into an 
apartment as a bachelor eight years ago, and has since moved to larger quarters 
in the neighborhood with his wife and young son. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of both, he said, "it's the best place in Southern California to 
live. . . . I like the feel of Belmont Shore. It's like a European Riviera kind 
of town. . . . I like the languid sensuality. . . . It's an archetype for 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The air is relatively clean and ocean breezes cool the hottest of summer 
nights, but for both of its communities, the secret of Belmont Shore's success 
is its scale. 
</P>
<P>
Within walking distance, it has one of each of the things any community could 
want: an ocean pier, a library branch, fire station, post office, weekly 
newspaper, an elementary and a middle school. A single, hotly contested seat on 
the Long Beach City Council represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
There are also multiples of other requisites in the neighborhood, such as 
houses of worship. Diversions include a pocket-sized recreation area right off 
Alamitos Bay, where wind surfers abound; boat slips; a recently completed 
three-mile beach bike path, which also provides lanes for pedestrians, skate 
boarders and roller skaters, and a new children's playground under development. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Bentley-Adler, who grew up in Long Beach, likes being able to park her 
car on a weekend and not move it. "Not having to drive is wonderful," she said. 
She also likes her neighbors. "There's a good mix of older people who've lived 
here 30, 40, 50 years; college kids, and a group like us in the middle. I like 
that mix." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler once lived with her husband, Jeff, in Ferrigno's old apartment 
building, later buying a one-story house up the street, on the beach block, for 
$165,000 in 1985. The couple is again looking for an apartment in Shore to stay 
in while their house is gutted and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Because she and her husband like to go to Los Angeles for cultural events and 
Dodger games, Bentley-Adler said she will make use of the new light rail Blue 
Line -- harkening back to the days when the Shore was connected to Los Angeles 
by the old Red Car line. 
</P>
<P>
A hydrofoil connects the Shore to Catalina Island and, for more distant 
traveling, Long Beach Airport is only 20 minutes away, with Los Angeles 
International Airport 45 minutes up the San Diego (405) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth DeGraw, an active, outgoing 85-year-old widow, didn't think twice about 
staying in the Shore after her husband died several years ago, even though she 
doesn't drive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home," she said. "I love it. I make lots of friends." 
</P>
<P>
After more than 20 years in the neighborhood, she uses her own wheeled cart to 
shop on nearby 2nd Street and, to travel farther, she takes advantage of good 
bus connections and friendly neighbors who drive. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Finnan moved to the Shore 30 years ago with his wife, Margaret, 
herself a second generation Long Beach resident, and he said he has enjoyed the 
neighborhood's continuity, watching families grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"People around us are more settled," he said. "It's a very stable group. In 
most neighborhoods, you don't know the people across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Finnan said there are "not many negatives" in the Shore. There is occasional 
friction in areas where apartments are next door to homes -- usually involving 
late parties and loud music or revving motors. Property crime is also on the 
rise, including the theft of Finnan's truck while it was parked outside his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest downer," Finnan said, are the homeless who have appeared in the 
alleys and on 2nd Street, but even that problem is of manageable scale, limited 
to six to eight recognizable "regulars." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret McClain, an 89-year-old resident who has lived in the Shore since 
1972, said that when she first saw the area as a visitor in 1906 much of it was 
a tidal marsh. Many of the current street names -- Covina, Laverne, Pomona, 
Claremont -- come from the areas where inland people camped in tents during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Dredging made the area safe for development in 1919, and in 1922, McGrath &amp; 
Selover invited people to buy in what was then called Belmont Shore Place, 
which, "in its ideal location . . . is destined to be the most sought-after 
residential spot in . . . the West." 
</P>
<P>
The first lots -- about 30-by-75 feet -- went for $1,600, enabling some people 
to buy a lot and a half. When houses were built, the building code limited the 
value of houses to another $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most were one-story, 800- to 1,200-square-foot rectangles, in 
varying shades of pastel stucco, with a variety of Mediterranean fronts and 
exteriors. For decades, the houses were rented for the summer to vacationing 
inland people. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Shore's unofficial historian, Bill Hepler, is also a neighborhood 
fixture, conducting his real estate, small arms and private investigation 
business on the phone in his front yard, usually shirtless. 
</P>
<P>
Hepler -- who once worked as a bodyguard for Richard Burton and Elizabeth 
Taylor -- has stayed in the area for nearly half a century, he said, because 
there's "a bohemian lifestyle down here, and I like it." 
</P>
<P>
The tanned, 75-year-old retired Long Beach police officer paid $4,750 for his 
house in 1942, but he can recall chasing polliwogs in the area as a boy before 
the dredging. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, one of his neighbors and fellow lifeguards was John Wayne -- 
still Marion Morrison then and a student at USC. He recalls shoveling bricks 
with Wayne from alleys after the Long Beach earthquake of 1933, which spared 
most houses in the Shore. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, the Shore became especially attractive as prices in the 
area -- from $150,000 to $350,000 -- were outpaced by equally convenient 
coastal locations such as Redondo Beach to the north and Seal Beach just to the 
south in Orange County. By the late '80s, prices caught up, and buying in -- 
even in the recently cooled market -- is not cheap. Most houses on the narrow, 
mostly one-way streets now range from $350,000 to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
That has not dissuaded two-career couples such as Charlie and Sharon Roy, who 
several years ago began looking for a place that would enable them to commute 
to his job in Irvine and hers in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they rented an older house in the Shore and liked the area so much 
they bought the house in 1986 for $172,000 and renovated it. When they decided 
they needed more room, they sold that house and bought another across the 
street, which they have since gutted and rebuilt as a contemporary, two-story, 
four bedroom home. Apart from the location, Charlie Roy says, what he likes 
most about the Shore is that "there's a good group of people living here. We 
know all our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, many of the original houses -- called "doll houses" by realtors -- 
have been expanded or remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Finnan, now semi-retired, totally redid the exterior of his home -- 
for which he paid $20,000 in 1959 -- opting for a Cape Cod style, replacing the 
original stucco with wood siding. 
</P>
<P>
At much less cost, other residents have been sprucing up their homes with 
polished wooden doors, small stained-glass windows, canvas awnings and 
greenhouse window boxes. Because yards are small, many residents who like the 
open air and a view of the water have built decks. 
</P>
<P>
Land values have gone so high that those few homes that have not been improved 
are being bought as tear-downs and replaced with large homes, often by 
developers, and offered at about $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Belmont Shore is 2nd Street, the place where its two communities 
rub shoulders on weekends and meet -- if only briefly -- around dinnertime. 
There are seasonal sidewalk sales and the community Christmas parade. 
</P>
<P>
When prospective buyers tour the area, said Betsy Ramirez of Coastline Realty, 
"2nd Street is the first thing they love." 
</P>
<P>
During the day, the 14-block commercial strip bustles. There are few errands 
that can't be run here: bank, bakery, dry cleaner, video rental, exercise club, 
shoemaker, doctor, lawyer, veterinarian, gas station, accountant, travel agent, 
bike repair, office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Here you can find two bookstores, a hardware store and a corner market -- none 
of which are part of a chain. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 restaurants span the spectrum: Chinese, Mexican, Italian, French, 
Japanese, seafood, fast food. (A Lebanese restaurant recently closed and the 
City Council has just voted a moratorium on any new or expanded restaurants.) 
</P>
<P>
For all its charm and diversity, 2nd Street is changing, and some residents 
fear that skyrocketing rents are destined to turn it into a "little Westwood 
Village," with the attendant crush and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, a Winchell's Donut became Le Donut and Croissant, a 
camera store was replaced by a clothing chain and a dry cleaner by a print 
gallery. One of the three locally owned pharmacies was sold to a discount drug 
chain, which has built a new outlet four times the size of the original. 
</P>
<P>
Parking spillover from 2nd Street is a constant irritant on adjoining blocks, 
and beach-goers on summer weekends choke the entire area. But residents also 
acknowledge that a large part of the problem is that very few residents use 
their garages for parking but for storage. Some have begun parking in the 
alleys behind their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Shore is ringed by some equally desirable neighborhoods, like the 
Peninsula and upscale Naples Island. 
</P>
<P>
Young people who grow up in the Shore often look for Shore rentals, often to 
attend nearby Cal State Long Beach or Long Beach City College, thus bridging 
the gap between the two communities that inhabit Belmont Shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Generations and generations keep coming coming back," said realtor Steve 
Ramirez. "It's part of a big city, but it's preserved its small-town 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Not for everyone, of course. In "The Horse Latitudes," Robert Ferrigno's 
protagonist saw it a little less prosaically: 
</P>
<P>
The Shore was a jumble of ambition, filled with salesgirls who took acting 
classes at night and bartenders who wrote screenplays during the day, part-time 
waitresses and substitute teachers, single and anonymous and overextended. 
People got a SAG card or a sugar daddy and moved out overnight, leaving their 
furniture and their damage deposit behind. It was a perfect place to get lost 
in.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: OBTAIN WRITTEN MARKETING PLAN TO ENSURE PROMISED SALES 
CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Several months ago when we put our home on the market for sale, we 
followed your advice and interviewed three agents before listing our home for 
sale with the best one. She came highly recommended, even by one of the other 
agents we interviewed. Her references were impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
However, we neglected to insist on a written marketing plan for our house. Due 
to the slowdown in home sales in our city, her brokerage is cutting back on its 
advertising and promotion. As a result, our home was barely advertised. 
</P>
<P>
When it became apparent that we had chosen the wrong agent, after 60 days of 
virtually no promotion and much hostility from the agent, we canceled the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
Then we listed our home with one of the other agents we interviewed. He gave us 
a written marketing plan and showed us examples of how his firm sells houses 
even in a slow market. As a result, after about three weeks he brought us a 
purchase offer that we accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't you include on your listing checklist a requirement the agent provide 
the home seller with a written marketing plan for the home? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Thank you for that valuable suggestion. The best realty agents specify 
in writing how they plan to sell the home. As you probably know, advertising, 
signs and open houses often are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
I recently heard of a major brokerage chain in Miami that recommends its home 
sellers obtain a professional appraisal of the house before a listing will be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
If a truly objective appraisal is made, this sounds like a good idea, providing 
the appraiser does not "low ball" the valuation to get the house listed for 
sale at a low price, which is easy to sell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Costly Mistake in Buying a Vacant Lot 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I bought a vacant lot in a very desirable neighborhood. It was 
being sold by an estate. We presumed we would be able to build a house on it, 
since it is a single-family neighborhood. However, when we contacted an 
architect about designing a house, she said the lot is below the minimum size 
for a house. 
</P>
<P>
We applied for a zoning variance, but were turned down. Our lawyer says we can 
appeal to the courts, but that can be very expensive. We were thinking of suing 
the estate for not telling us the lot is unbuildable. But our lawyer refuses to 
take the case. He says the estate cannot be held liable for non-disclosure of 
the lot's small size. Do you think we should appeal? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your situation is a classic example of why buyers of vacant land should 
first check to learn what can be built on the property. Apparently there was a 
very good reason why that lot remained vacant in an otherwise built up 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, I wouldn't give up. If your lot has no practical use, and the city 
refuses to grant a zoning variance, you may have a damage claim against the 
city. I suggest you find a lawyer who is experienced in zoning matters. The 
local Board of Realtors can give you the name of their lawyer who probably will 
either be interested in taking your case or can recommend another lawyer who 
specializes in zoning litigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Not to Use a Wraparound Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: You said it is better for a home seller to carry back a wraparound mortgage 
instead of a second mortgage. But when I showed your article to our real estate 
agent she said that only applies if the existing first mortgage does not have a 
due-on-sale clause. Since we expect our buyer to get a new first mortgage, 
wouldn't we also be better off with a wraparound rather than a second mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not necessarily. The best time for the seller to carry back a wraparound 
instead of a second mortgage occurs when there is an existing low-interest rate 
first mortgage without a due on sale clause. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose your home sells for $200,000 and it has an existing 
$100,000 VA mortgage at 8% interest that is assumable. If the buyer makes a 
$40,000 cash down payment, that leaves a $60,000 finance gap. You can fill it 
by carrying back a $60,000 second mortgage at perhaps 10% interest. But you 
would be better off, and the sale would be more attractive, to the buyer if you 
instead carry back a $160,000 wraparound mortgage at perhaps 9.5% interest. You 
then earn 9.5% interest on $60,000 plus the 1.5% interest rate differential on 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage is the buyer makes one payment to you and then you use part 
of that money to keep up payments on the old first mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the buyer will be getting a new first mortgage, it doesn't really 
matter if you carry back a second or a wraparound mortgage. But do not carry 
back a wraparound loan if the first loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage. The 
reason is you could become the "stuckee" if its interest rate is adjustable, 
but your wraparound loan has a fixed interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Home Seller Deduct a Loss? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home about five years ago. Since then the state has upgraded a 
nearby road into a very noisy freeway. To make matters worse, they built an 
off-ramp exit that pours traffic down the street in front of our house. It is 
so bad it often takes me 10 minutes to find a break in the traffic, so I can 
back out of my driveway. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, houses on our street have lost considerable market value. The 
homeowners are suing the state and the city, but I doubt we will ever collect 
for the lost value of our properties. Due to a job transfer I have to sell. My 
employer hired a relocation company that had our house appraised, but the value 
came out about $14,000 less than we paid for it. We have decided to accept 
their offer. Can we deduct our loss on our income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Losses on the sale of your personal residence are not tax-deductible. 
However, you could have turned this situation into a tax-deductible loss if you 
had converted the house into rental property before selling. Losses on the sale 
of investment or business property are tax deductible. It's too late now for 
you, but perhaps other readers can benefit from your mistake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Right Form for Power of Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a title officer with a major title insurance company. It would be a big 
help if you would clarify for your many readers the difference between a 
general and a limited power of attorney form. We have many people who bring us 
a limited power of attorney form, usually prepared by an attorney, but we need 
a general power of attorney where a person is representing an absent seller 
such as a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Often there is not enough time to get a general power of attorney form signed 
and notarized before the scheduled closing date. Any seller or buyer who plans 
to use a power of attorney should consult the title insurance company well in 
advance to be sure they have the correct form. 
</P>
<P>
A: A power of attorney form can be very valuable when a buyer or seller is 
unable to be present for the sale of a property. With a power of attorney 
someone else, such as a spouse, can sign the papers for the absent person. 
</P>
<P>
A limited power of attorney form appoints an attorney in fact just for a 
limited purpose, such as to sign papers necessary for the sale of a house. But 
most title insurance companies now insist on a general power of attorney form, 
so there is no question that the attorney has power to sign whatever forms are 
required for the sale or purchase. By consulting the title insurer well in 
advance of the closing, the right power of attorney form can be prepared and 
signed, so there are no last-minute problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rent Run-Down House With an Option to Buy 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home almost three years ago. It was a fixer-upper then and it 
still is. Our plan was to fix it up, but then my husband lost his job and we 
had some illness. Now we have to sell as we can't afford the mortgage payment. 
A fine realtor has been trying to sell it for the last four months but, buyers 
are turned off by the need for renovation, which we can't afford to do. Any 
ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rent with an option to buy. Your house should appeal to bargain hunters who 
lack much cash for a down payment. You will be amazed at how lease-option 
tenants start fixing up a run-down house because they know someday they will 
exercise the purchase option and own it. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many lease-option advantages for both owner and tenant I can't 
list them all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Refinancing Better Than a Credit Line? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have about $100,000 equity in my home, and I would like to use part of it 
to get started investing in houses, probably fixer-upper houses. Do you think I 
should refinance my first mortgage even though it has an 8.75% fixed-interest 
rate or should I take an equity credit line which would be at 10% as I write 
this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unless your first mortgage is very small, I would leave it undisturbed and 
go for the home-equity credit line. The best feature of credit lines is they 
don't cost anything until you use them.

OLDER HOMES AND QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Ross' answer to a homeowner's question about bolting a house to its 
foundation in the June 10 Ask the Inspector column was apparently not well 
researched, and may have been a disservice to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of homes came through in "good stead" during the Loma Prieta 
earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989, but more than 23,000 homes were damaged and over 
1,000 destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the major damage occurred to older homes with inadequately braced 
cripple walls at their crawl spaces, but there was a large number of homes that 
slid off their foundations because they lacked foundation bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Repair of this type of damage is expensive; it often requires wholesale 
foundation work and replacement of the crawl space framing and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Older homes still pose a significant risk of earthquake damage, not only in Los 
Angeles but throughout much of the state. There is a 60% chance of a major 
earthquake occurring in the Los Angeles basin sometime within the next 30 years 
that may cause much higher levels of ground shaking over a much wider area than 
the three earthquakes you mentioned in the column. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you indicated in the column that 1935 was the year when houses were first 
required to be more earthquake-resistant. While this may have been the case in 
a few communities, houses were being built in many parts of the state without 
foundation bolts or cripple wall bracing as late as the 1950s. We estimate that 
there are over 2.4 million such homes in California that are at risk from 
significant earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
A bill pending in the Legislature would require earthquake hazard evaluations 
at the time of sale and installation of anchor bolts and cripple-wall bracing 
in older homes if they are not present. If passed, Assembly Bill 3561 would 
take a big step toward reducing earthquake hazards in older homes. 
</P>
<P>
We agree with you that it would be a "bit close-minded" to exclude an older 
home from anyone's plans simply because the foundation is not bolted. 
Wood-frame structures remain one of the safest types to occupy during an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But, please consider that it could cost the average do-it-yourselfer only a few 
hundred dollars and a few weekends to bolt a house to its foundation and nail 
plywood to crawl-space walls. 
</P>
<P>
An owner who hires a contractor can typically expect to pay $1,500 to $4,500 -- 
roughly 1% of the home's market value. We believe that house-bolting, 
cripple-wall bracing, and abatement of falling hazards such as water heaters 
are the best forms of earthquake "insurance" a homeowner can buy.

This response I felt was necessary on Warren Harwood's letter (Aug. 5), 
commenting on "A Maturing L.A. Grows Out and In." It is pleasing to see that 
there some politicians with integrity still left in our political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we in Los Angeles have none. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood's answers to the quotes by our former head of the Los Angeles Planning 
Commission were right on target. I would say that his sentiments would reflect 
the feelings of most of us who live in suburban areas today. 
</P>
<P>
The regrettable situation in Los Angeles is that we do not have a City Council 
member who isn't directly or indirectly beholding to the purveyors of 
overdevelopment. If such persons exist, let them stand up and be heard.

PSYCHING ONESELF UP TO BE A RENTER FOR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rhonda Bright

<TEXT>
<P>
Like safe sex and other life style habits adapted out of necessity, renting 
needs to gain respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the notion that renting is some temporary, deprived state simply may 
not be statistically true in Los Angeles in the future," said Alan Kreditor, 
dean of the USC School of Urban Planning and Development, who rented for five 
years in the Hollywood Hills before buying a house there. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply may be a way of life for certain segments of the population, and we 
ought to make that the best life we can." 
</P>
<P>
Renting, after all, does have advantages -- mobility, liquidity, less 
responsibility and upkeep, the potential for a shorter commute. 
</P>
<P>
And although recent L.A. trends may indicate otherwise, not all property 
appreciates in value. 
</P>
<P>
"Renting is not such a bad deal economically," said Andrei Simic, USC urban 
anthropologist. "In the short run, it's a better deal than buying." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Linda Blakeley, psychotherapist and consultant who specializes in 
stress management: "If buying a house is a long-term goal, then people have to 
look at their life and ask 'What can I do to achieve this goal?' 
</P>
<P>
"It might mean reeducation and going back to school. It might mean changing 
jobs. It might mean looking at the kinds of jobs on the market that pay the 
kind of money that can enable (wanna-be homeowners) to move into the kinds of 
homes that they want." 
</P>
<P>
Those who see no way out of renting should try to come to terms with it 
emotionally, make the best of it, and perhaps work toward achieving other goals 
that will give meaning to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"People in that situation where they can't leave Los Angeles, and they have to 
rent, should begin to look at alternative goals. It's important for us to 
develop goals that we can achieve," said Blakeley, author of the manual "The 
ABCs of Stress Management" and who conducts seminars on dealing with stress. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to figure out, 'What goals are achievable, what creates happiness in 
my life?' You need to find things that are going to make you happy, separated 
from material gains and material possessions." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise and deep-breathing techniques are also advised for reducing stress 
induced from the long-term goal of buying a home in a tough, out-of-reach 
market. "You have to have stamina to look toward goals that you don't see 
presently," Blakeley explained. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mark Goulston, UCLA psychiatry professor, "The key is to be able to find 
some way to enjoy the other aspects of your life so you don't drive yourself 
crazy over this one kind of problem." Rhonda Bright

VACATION HOME SALES TO SURGE, STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND HOMES: ECOLOGISTS CONCERNED ABOUT INCREASED DEMAND FOR RESORT PROPERTIES 
IN 1990S AS BABY BOOMERS MOVE INTO THE AGE GROUP THAT TYPICALLY BUYS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTIN DOWNEY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the next 10 years, droves of baby boomers may be heading for the hills. And 
for the mountains. And for the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
According to a new survey financed by the real estate and resort-development 
industry, demand for second homes may surge in the 1990s as baby boomers move 
into the age group that typically buys vacation properties. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for vacation properties may soar from its current level of about 135,000 
purchases a year to as many as 450,000 a year, according to the study's 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby boomers generally are reaching that point in their lives where people 
historically have purchased vacation homes," said Steven S. Miner, research 
director of Eugene, Ore.-based Ragatz Associates Inc., which conducted the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
But the shift of development to the nation's hinterlands already is a matter of 
grave concern to environmentalists, who worry that more people and more traffic 
in once-pristine areas will damage wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a new twist, some are advocating that the federal government take a new 
look at the ways in which it is helping to accelerate the process. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Forest Service report, based on public hearings and backed by 
environmental groups, has suggested that the federal government should 
reconsider the tax breaks it gives to people who buy vacation homes in such 
ecologically important areas as New England's Northern Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal tax provision to deduct the interest on second-home mortgages may 
encourage the demand for recreational development and could be partially 
responsible for the increased rate of land conversion threatening the Northern 
Forest," the report said. "While the purpose of the deduction is to stimulate 
growth and construction, it may be having other effects in the Northern 
Forest." 
</P>
<P>
For many within the real estate industry, the mortgage-interest deduction is a 
key issue. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, people who own second homes can deduct from their taxable 
incomes the mortgage interest they pay on the properties. In other words, 
depending on a household's tax bracket, the federal government will subsidize 
up to one-third of the cost of owning a vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern Forest environmentalists are focusing on tax policy as a way to 
block development because the federal budget deficit means that little money is 
available to purchase land to protect it, said Mason Morfit, executive director 
of the Maine chapter of the Nature Conservancy, a group that buys 
environmentally endangered land to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, money is so tight that we thought the federal government 
would be more willing to look at (changing) tax policy than at grants," Morfit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of environmentalists tinkering with real estate-related tax policy is 
frightening to many in the real estate industry, who say that elimination of 
the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes could prove catastrophic to 
resort developers and rural areas that rely on tourism dollars to survive. They 
say that without the mortgage-interest deduction, many vacationers would rent 
rather than buy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rather ludicrous proposal; it's so far-fetched it boggles my mind," 
said Chuck Houseman, sales manager for Litchfield Co., a resort-development 
firm based in Pawleys Island, S.C. Houseman said land-use issues should be 
decided locally, and not by tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
To others, however, the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes is a 
fairness issue, particularly in light of the perennial federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Zigas of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, for one, said he 
believes the current mortgage-interest-deduction system is inequitable. He said 
money being spent by the federal government on tax breaks for vacation homes 
for the affluent could be better spent helping house those who do not have 
first homes. 
</P>
<P>
The questions surrounding the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes 
could gain further currency if the number of people buying vacation homes leaps 
in the next few years, as predicted by the resort-development industry's 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
According to that survey, more than one-fifth of people under 39 years of age 
expressed interest and said they had at least a 50-50 chance of purchasing 
recreational property, with people under 30 particularly keen on the idea. In 
contrast, 12.5% of those over 50-years-old expressed the same sentiments, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors, the International Foundation for Timesharing 
and the American Resort and Residential Development Assn. Political Education 
Fund paid for the study, which consisted of telephone interviews last spring 
with 5,636 people nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Its other findings included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The highest rates of vacation home ownership are among households that are 
headed by people aged 45 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About 1 in 13 U.S. households owns recreational property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Time-share ownership of resort housing is increasing in popularity. Almost 
half of all new second-home owners since 1973 have been time-share buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida is clearly the nation's second-home hot spot, with more people 
identifying it as the place where they own a vacation home, or would if they 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While married couples make up only about 56% of all households, they make 
up more than 78% of all recreational property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 -- People who already own homes are far more likely to also own a vacation 
home. They are four times more likely to own recreational property than are 
apartment renters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The median income nationwide of recreational property owners is $46,500, 
but among families earning $100,000 or more, nearly one-third own vacation 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On average, recreational properties are little used: Total average usage 
came to only about 58 nights per year, or about eight weeks of annual use. 
About half that occupancy was by renters, with the owners, their relatives or 
friends using it for the equivalent of the other month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than half of the potential second-home purchasers said loss of the 
mortgage-interest deduction would cause them to reconsider a vacation home 
purchase.

INSURERS WIN UPGRADE ISSUE

Insurance companies are not bound to cover extra construction costs mandated by 
new building codes when paying damages on insured structures, the state Supreme 
Court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The decision could have implications for many San Francisco Bay area residents 
whose homes were damaged in October's Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was whether the insured or the insurer should pay for upgrading older 
structures to current code after they are damaged. The upgrades often add 
substantially to reconstruction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Locke and Sumire McCorkle of Mill Valley filed the failed suit against State 
Farm Fire and Casualty Co. after the firm refused to pay the full replacement 
cost for a garage destroyed in a 1986 fire. 
</P>
<P>
Replacement cost was estimated at $29,350. However, a new code forced the 
McCorkle's to install a cement floor and foundation in place of the old wooden 
floor, which raised the cost to $58,448. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm refused to pay the additional cost, saying it was obligated to pay 
only for "equivalent construction." 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal ruled in State Farm's favor in June, and the 
McCorkles appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled this month.

REMODELING SETS QUARTERLY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to the continuing national slump in new and existing home sales, 
residential remodeling recorded a record high, seasonally adjusted, annual 
expenditure rate of $114.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, according 
to the Remodelors Council of the National Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
This rate is a 7.4% improvement over the previous quarter rate of $106.2 
billion and a 16.4% rise over the first quarter 1989 rate of $98 billion, 
according to Indianapolis remodeler Frank Spivey, council chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in major replacements tells us that America's housing stock is 
getting older and that people are continuing to update their homes in an effort 
to bring them in line with today's living standards," he said.

Doggone!: There are an estimated 50,000 dogs in the city of Lhasa, Tibet, 
including 10,000 strays. To cope with the canines in a land where dogs were 
once revered as messengers of Buddha, authorities have built the first dog 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking the Ice: The Soviet Union's atomic-powered ice breaker Rossiya has 
taken scientists and tourists on the first Arctic cruise to the North Pole, 
according to the Soviet news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers were taken a short distance by helicopter to Hayes Island in the 
Arctic Ocean over a period of several hours, Tass said. The island is the site 
of the largest observatory in the far north. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists had the opportunity to view polar bears and visited the bathhouse and 
homes on the island, where researchers from Canada and France recently studied 
the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
A Glass-Bottomed Boat?: Tom McClean recently became the first man to cross the 
Atlantic in a "bottle" when he arrived in Falmouth, England, after a harrowing 
37-day journey from New York. 
</P>
<P>
McClean made the 2,950-mile voyage in the 37-foot, bottle-shaped Typhoon 
Atlantic Challenger with the aim of raising $950,000 for charity. It was his 
fifth solo Atlantic crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets' Red Glare: Providing yet another reason that this is not the time 
to be visiting India's Kashmir Valley, Moslem rebels recently fired rockets 
into two hotels in Srinagar, including the Broadway, a modern four-star hotel 
often frequented by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the shellings, but it was the first time rebels had attacked 
a hotel housing civilian guests. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels view the establishments as "defense installations," an argument 
given credence now that a dozen hotels in the city have been taken over as 
barracks for security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism in the Himalayan valley has dropped from 250,000 visitors in the first 
seven months of last year to 1,200 people through July this year, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Talking Turkey: Conrad Hotels, a subsidiary of Hilton USA, will open a 672-room 
luxury hotel, the Hotel Conrad Istanbul, in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is being built on a six-acre site on Ylidiz Avenue overlooking the 
Bosporus. 
</P>
<P>
Licking the Problem: Moscow, which often boasts of having the world's best ice 
cream, has a shortage in these waning days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream kiosks on street corners and in city parks have been displaying "no 
ice cream" signs, although they continue to sell souvenirs, marshmallows, 
chocolates and other candies. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the Baskin-Robbins 
stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat pedestrian mall, or the 
Soviet-Swiss joint venture Pinguin. 
</P>
<P>
But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have always taken 
pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in paper-wrapped slabs or on 
sticks, rather than in cones. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the shortage has been caused by two of the three ice 
cream-making factories in Moscow being closed for repairs this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Forwarding Address: The offices of the Consulate General of France and the 
French Cultural Services have moved to the Oppenheimer Tower, 10990 Wilshire 
Blvd., Suite 300, Los Angeles 90024. The telephone is (213) 479-4426. 
</P>
<P>
Jogging Escort: To allay the fears of New York visitors who would like to run 
through Central Park but worry about being mugged, a new hotel in midtown 
Manhattan is offering escort runners for hire. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee of $35, Penny Baxter, jogger-in-residence at the Hotel Macklowe, will 
escort hotel guests on a run through the park at any hour between dawn and 
dusk. 
</P>
<P>
The service, the newest in hotel offerings, comes about a year after a brutal 
attack on a young female investment banker running alone in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, who has a degree in exercise physiology and a corporate fitness 
background, said middle-aged businessmen had shown the most interest in the 
jogging service so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Since last April, people are more fearful of running in the park," said Debbie 
King of the New York Road Runners Club, referring to the 1989 Central Park 
jogger attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering doing something similar with hotels throughout the city," 
said King, adding that despite growing fears about the dangers of Central Park, 
crime in the 843-acre park has actually dropped 25% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Hotel Macklowe, 145 West 44th St. (between 
Broadway and 6th), New York 10036, (212) 768-4400.

Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill is endowed not only with the best 360-degree view 
of San Francisco, its bay bridges and other natural wonders, but also with a 
splendid inner lookout on California history in its recently restored 
Depression-era murals, "Aspects of Life in California, 1934." 
</P>
<P>
The Diego Rivera-influenced Social Realist frescoes have undergone a three-year 
restoration and are open to the public after a long period of neglect. 
</P>

The 27 frescoes and recessed lunette paintings are a time capsule of life in 
California in the '30s, depicting sports and agriculture, home life and heavy 
industry, labor unrest and newspaper headlines, and scenes from street life, 
even including an auto accident and a stick-up. 
</P>

"Aspects" was an extraordinary collaboration of 26 master painters and their 19 
assistants in a pioneer federal arts project that followed the completion of 
the tower -- a memorial to San Francisco's volunteer firemen bequeathed by 
Lillie Hitchcock Coit -- in 1933. Most visitors think the murals are the work 
of one artist, so skillfully blended were the many talents. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of uproar over federally funded art and the disintegration of 
Communism, the murals are doubly fascinating, for "Aspects" was controversial 
when it opened for its supposed Communist undertones. 
</P>
<P>
In one mural, for example, a man reaches for a book by Karl Marx; in another, 
grim workers demonstrate in a May Day parade. The exhibit closed a few days 
later while a debate raged, and some of the offending art was actually 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Coit Tower sits above North Beach and the waterfront, within walking distance 
of the best Italian cafes in town, cable car lines, the financial district, 
Fisherman's Wharf and Chinatown. It is open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 
5:15 p.m. LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY

CONSUMER REPORT: NONSMOKER RENTAL CARS REMAIN BURNING ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THERE AREN'T MANY SMOKE-FREE AUTOS AVAILABLE TO RENT NOW, BUT 
LOOK FOR THE MAJOR COMPANIES TO BEGIN OFFERING THEM AS THE DEMAND INCREASES.

Want to fly smoke-free? It's easy enough now, on domestic flights under six 
hours and on an increasing number of foreign airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Prefer a smokeless hotel room? No problem. Many hotels offer entire floors of 
smoke-free rooms. Similarly, some cruise lines have separate sections for 
nonsmokers in their dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But what about renting a car that exudes no evidence of cigarette smoke? 
</P>
<P>
Not so easy. 
</P>
<P>
No major rental car chain of eight I contacted offers smoke-free autos on a 
system-wide basis, though some do provide such vehicles in a few U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Thrifty became the first car rental company to offer a national 
program of no-smoking cars. But its plan has gradually diminished. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great for customers, but hard to administer due to problems of 
compliance by renters and the need to have no-smoking cars in all of our 
various rental classifications," said Melody Blanch-Scott, a Thrifty 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not someone lights up in a no-smoking car is strictly on the honor 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose the nonsmoking renter has a business client in the car who smokes," 
Blanch-Scott said. "They're not likely to tell this person that he or she can't 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for car rental companies such as Thrifty that has various 
franchise licensees is in getting the approval of each franchise to set aside a 
number of vehicles for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're between revival and death on this subject," Blanch-Scott said. 
"A decision may be reached this fall, and one possibility is to make our whole 
fleet nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll only revive the program on a national basis if we can administer it 
well internally and meet customer expectations externally. We have to make sure 
renters will be able to get cars with no signs or smells of smoking. The trend 
in the United States is very much toward nonsmoking, and we expect the number 
of nonsmoking renters to increase." 
</P>
<P>
Hertz is testing a no-smoking program at some corporate locations on the West 
Coast. No-smoking decals are put on the windshield facing the driver and on the 
outside of the car for staff personnel to identify the cars. A no-smoking 
medallion is also placed on the key chain. 
</P>
<P>
"Once someone smokes, the car becomes a smoking car," said Hertz spokeswoman 
Brenda Rigby. "Renters can request a no-smoking car, but there's no guarantee 
one will be available." 
</P>
<P>
No-smoking cars are not offered at Hertz's overseas stations, Rigby added. 
</P>
<P>
Avis offers no-smoking vehicles at a few of its company-owned locations in the 
United States, but none overseas, according to Dmitria Mudar, an Avis 
spokeswoman. "The logistics of running such a program are difficult," she said, 
"and there hasn't been much demand." 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rent A Car had discontinued a no-smoking program it began several years 
ago, but revived it recently with a successful test-market program in Detroit 
and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraging our licensees to participate in such a program, and when we 
have a strong enough interest we may launch a no-smoking car program 
nationally," said Brian Baker, a Dollar spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a few stations that offer no-smoking cars," said Mike Olson, a 
National Car Rental spokesman. "But we don't offer this nationwide. It's a 
tough program to do on a national basis. " A similar response came from Budget 
Rent A Car. "We don't offer no-smoking cars on a national basis, though some 
stations might have a number of such cars," said Budget spokeswoman Jodi 
Chapman. "We're not aware of any customer demand for such cars. We get new cars 
around every four months, so our cars are relatively fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Only a consistent amount of smoking in a car would make it suspect anyway, 
according to Chapman. "Moreover, there are many more nonsmokers than smokers 
renting cars." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rental companies replacing vehicles in their fleets at a rapid 
clip, cars allocated as nonsmoking vehicles still -- as a rule -- have ashtrays 
and cigarette lighters as part of their equipment (decals, though, advising of 
the auto's special status might be placed in their vicinity). 
</P>
<P>
"We don't remove ashtrays or lighters because we lease the cars and return them 
intact to the manufacturer," explained Baker of Dollar Rent A Car. 
</P>
<P>
No-smoking cars are not offered by Alamo Rent a Car for many of the same 
reasons. "Due to our high utilization, we'd rather have cars available for all 
customers than holding some cars for nonsmoking renters," said Alamo's Liz 
Clark. The likelihood of finding no-smoking rental cars overseas is slim. 
"Smoking is much more of an issue in the U.S. than in Europe," said Malcolm 
Pynn, spokesman for Kemwel, a rental company. "But some of our stations in 
Europe may have no-smoking cars, and consumers should request one when they 
make a reservation. But there's no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is one of enforcement, but we're coming to the point that if 
people see a no-smoking decal in the car, they'll abide by it." 
</P>
<P>
According to Pynn, creating an overall policy would mean going to each 
franchise Kemwel has in Europe and asking representatives if they would be 
willing to set aside a number of no-smoking vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"This can depend on how much business comes from the U.S. and how much from 
Europe," he said. "But I think in the next couple of years we're going to see a 
much greater amount of no-smoking cars. This is the trend." 
</P>
<P>
Said Budget's Chapman: "The social stigma of smoking hasn't spread overseas 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, consumers who desire a no-smoking car should request one. Or 
advise travel agents accordingly. Car rental companies will usually make a note 
of the request during your booking. "Suggest that your travel agent call the 
individual car station if possible and not the central toll-free reservations 
number," Rigby of Hertz advised.

MOTORCYCLISTS DRAW STARES ALONG THE SILK ROAD 
</P>

CHOP, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A startled peasant on his rickety, horse-drawn cart stared in disbelief as 
several dozen high-powered motorcycles sped by. This was something he'd never 
seen before, and he was not sure what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
With a roar, the shiny, high-tech world of Western prosperity had suddenly 
crossed paths with the rough, homespun simplicity of the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
It was like that throughout the first leg of our motorcycle odyssey across the 
southern Soviet Union. Present met past. New met old. West met East. 
</P>
<P>
In sleepy villages all across the countryside, people stopped whatever they 
were doing to watch the remarkable sight. For many, we foreigners, dressed at 
times like spacemen in shiny silver rainsuits, were the first people they had 
ever seen from such exotic places as Canada, France and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Our visits, no matter how brief, kept villagers talking for days. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, we must have seemed an unusual sight -- 110 people in a motorcycle 
caravan flying foreign flags and roaring along the pot-holed, two-lane roads 
that once were trade routes leading to the famed Silk Road. 
</P>
<P>
The caravan had started out in Paris on a journey via Lyon, Munich, Vienna and 
Budapest to Chop, a small Ukrainian town just across the Hungarian border. Once 
in the Soviet Union, we rode from Uzghorod to Chelmitski to Kishinev and on to 
Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
At Odessa, we had boarded a boat to travel across the Black Sea to Yalta, Sochi 
and Novorossisk, before disembarking and continuing, on to Krasnodar, 
Stavropol, Elista and finally to Astrakhan, where the Volga empties into the 
Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The two-week, 3,100-mile trip, aimed at increasing cultural understanding and 
interchange, was sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), several Soviet organizations and BMW of France. 
</P>
<P>
It was an eye-opening experience for both the riders and the people we met 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
At first, in places like Chop, the faces of the people who came out of their 
homes to watch us zoom by were familiar and European-looking. But, as we roared 
eastward, they became more and more exotic. 
</P>
<P>
The first Asian-looking well-wishers appeared on the 160-mile stretch between 
Stavropol and Elista, from which an offshoot of the Silk Road once ran south to 
the Mediterranean. In Elista and Astrakhan, many people had the dark complexion 
and oval eyes of Mongols and Tartars. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain also changed. Once into the Soviet Union, the well-planned, 
productive fields and vineyards of the Ukraine and Moldavia were replaced first 
by occasional farms and then by the great steppe -- a vast prairie stretching 
endlessly to the horizon. In some places, camels trotted along the road, 
unperturbed by the motorbikes flashing past. 
</P>
<P>
"There are treasures in the south that no one knows about -- most tourists just 
go to Moscow," said Jeff Brinkert, a Toronto journalist and the only North 
American on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Astrakhan, traditional tepees, called kibitki, had been erected by the 
local residents, mostly Kazakhs and Turks, who entertained us with dances in 
folk costume and camel-riding displays. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, there was considerable interest along our route in the 
motorbikes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"How much would a motorcycle like that cost?" asked Vyacheslav, a first-year 
student at Krasnodar Polytechnical Institute and a motorcycle rider himself. 
When told that one of the BMWs sold for $6,000 to $8,000, he quickly converted 
the sum into rubles and said he would buy one. 
</P>
<P>
As the caravan moved east, the food changed from typically Russian tourist fare 
-- fried meat and potatoes -- into the diverse ethnic dishes of the Soviet 
south. The local costumes and dances also changed along the way. 
</P>
<P>
In Elista, an area populated by Kalmyks of Mongolian descent, young people 
dressed in rich-colored silks with sequins and fur hats interpreted through 
dance the flight of birds, daily chores and their people's history. 
</P>
<P>
"Under Communism it was a problem to support our traditions, but now, on the 
contrary, it is easy," said Nikolai Konstantinovich Serenov, the mayor of 
Elista. "In schools today, Russian and Kalmyk children are learning the Kalmyk 
language." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new attention paid to local custom, there were many signs of Soviet 
uniformity, like the statues of Lenin that stood in cities from Chop to 
Astrakhan. Communist Party slogans, painted on buildings and road billboards, 
read: "Glory to the Working Class -- Builder of Communism" and "Bread Forever, 
Our Life, Our Motherland, Our Mother!" 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet rule, various ethnic minorities lived and worked together largely 
without strife, perhaps bound together by a common fear. But an unfortunate 
side-effect of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's social and economic reforms has 
been ethnic unrest, and sections of the route we traveled had at times been 
flash points for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a police helicopter accompanied the caravan on the road from the 
Black Sea to Krasnodar, where local authorities were concerned about 
"extremists." In Kishinev, the capital of Moldavia, the caravan was diverted 
from the city center, where a weekly Sunday protest meeting was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred years ago, hired warriors guarded the Silk Road's merchants and 
their wares. Our caravan was provided full police protection for its 69 
motorcycles, 10 cars and a truck toting the 20 tons of precious gasoline. For 
the full 1,860 miles, three or four police cars, sirens roaring and lights 
flashing, escorted the group through the countryside and into the towns. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us feel as if we are in prison," said a Swiss rider. "Even though we 
are on our motorbikes, we feel enclosed." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities' fears notwithstanding, there were always exuberant supporters who 
waved at the motorcyclists, clasped their hands together in a victory sign or 
rode in their cars for miles just to follow the group. 
</P>
<P>
And each night, Soviet hosts were eager to treat the travelers to the best they 
had. 
</P>
<P>
Although the participants, mostly students from France, West Germany, Canada, 
Japan, Australia, Austria, Italy and Switzerland, had some complaints, the 
overall experience did expose them to a part of the world few foreigners see. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not something I would expect from the Soviet Union," said Kristen 
Ritchard, a photography student from Australia. "What we know of the Soviet 
Union is what we learn in school or read in the papers. This is quite a 
different place." 
</P>
<P>
The journey did not end in Astrakhan; instead, it merely paused for a while. 
The trip's organizers plan to cover the entire Silk Road, but in annual stages. 
</P>
<P>
Next summer, the motorcyclists will resume the trip at Astrakhan and ride 
through Kazakhstan and Soviet Central Asia to the Chinese border. In 1992, 
they'll ride the third and last leg from the Sino-Soviet border to the sea. 
</P>
<P>

writing to Patrick Mage at 3 Avenue Ampere, Montigny le Bretonneux, 78886

BRIDGE AT REMAGEN REMAINS A POIGNANT SYMBOL;

<P>
REMAGEN: REMINDER OF THE WAR

REMAGEN, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The senior burghers of this lovely town on the Middle Rhine prefer to tell 
Americans of its many tourist attractions and to shrug aside all allusions to 
another influx of Yankees in an earlier and unfriendlier time. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Dreesbach, a spry pensioner, was the first person we spoke to in Remagen. 
Where could we find the site of its famous bridge? 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much to see there," he said in passable English. "Visitors find 
our new mall, the promenade along the river or our churches to be much more 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
But we were persistent, and he finally gave us directions to the bridge site. 
We were also curious. Where did he learn his English? 
</P>
<P>
"In Canada," he said. "In Lethbridge, Alberta." 
</P>
<P>
And what was he doing in Canada? 
</P>
<P>
"I fought in the Afrika Korps with Rommel and was taken prisoner. I spent much 
of the war in a POW camp working on Canadian farms." 
</P>
<P>
We understood then why Herr Dreesbach -- and other veterans we met in Remagen 
-- were reluctant to speak of the bridge. It still rankles them as a reminder 
of the Wehrmacht's failures and blunders and of their own sacrifices in a lost 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
It was on March 7, 1945, that an advance patrol of an American tank division, 
led by 2nd Lt. Karl H. Timmermann, fought its way to the heights above Remagen 
and made a discovery that historians agree was a turning point in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although the retreating German armies had blown up every other span across the 
Rhine to slow the Allied pursuit, the Ludendorff railroad bridge, capable of 
carrying the heaviest American tanks, was, incredibly, still standing. 
</P>
<P>
After an intense battle, the bridge fell within a day to three companies of 
GIs, one of them under the command of Timmermann, a Nebraskan of German 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next week, more than 25,000 troops and their tanks and equipment swept 
across the Rhine and became the spearhead of the decisive Allied drive into the 
heart of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of Allied Forces in Europe, later 
wrote: "Broad success in war is usually foreseen by days or weeks (but) this 
was completely unforeseen. We were across the Rhine on a permanent bridge . . . 
The final defeat of the enemy was just around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
Adolf Hitler also understood that failure of his officers to destroy the bridge 
was a prelude to Germany's final defeat, and had four of them shot. 
</P>
<P>
Under constant attack by German planes and heavy guns, the bridge fell into the 
river 10 days after its capture, carrying 18 Americans to their death. By that 
time, however, combat engineers had built a temporary floating bridge 200 yards 
downstream and the flow of arms and troops continued without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
Today, nothing is left of the bridge except for two lofty stone abutments on 
each side of the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12 miles from Bonn and midway between Cologne and Koblenz, Remagen has 
undergone little change since its brief but crucial wartime role. New buildings 
arose from the rubble left by bombs and artillery in those sections of the town 
nearest the fighting at the bridge. But most of the older buildings, including 
those in the town square, still stand. 
</P>
<P>
It is only a five-minute drive up a steep hillside and through an exclusive 
residential district to St. Apollinaris Church and the vantage point from which 
Timmermann first saw the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial museum in one of the bridge abutments on the Remagen side of the 
river presents a closer and more stark picture of the battle. A circular 
stairway leads to a succession of small chambers containing hundreds of 
photographs of the action, plus the actual weapons and battle gear of both 
German and American troops. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a reproduction of a letter Timmermann sent home shortly after the 
battle in which he wrote: "There's no glory in war. Maybe those who have never 
been in battle find that certain glory and glamour that doesn't exist. Perhaps 
they get it from the movies or the comic strips." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a plaque outside the museum honoring the 18 Americans who died 
in the collapse of the bridge has been torn down by vandals. 
</P>
<P>
A 1969 movie, "The Bridge at Remagen," starring George Segal, was based on the 
history of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Our own reception at the museum was not exactly cordial. An elderly ticket 
seller and guide, who spoke not a word of English although conceding that most 
visitors were Americans, tried to overcharge us by manipulating the exchange 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Although we paid the precise amount a placard over his head said we should pay, 
he was still nattering away at us when we left 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
But except for the dour docent, we found the residents of Remagen to be warm 
and welcoming. And we found Remagen itself to be one of the most restful and 
least touristy towns along the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
Built on a hillside within sight of terraced vineyards, Remagen commands a view 
of a swiftly flowing section of the Rhine and its constant stream of barges and 
sightseeing craft. The town was once a popular vacation retreat for Roman 
emperors and, later, for German kaisers. 
</P>
<P>
A long promenade with a hotel, the Furstenberg, plus sidewalk cafes and the 
mansions of the wealthy run the length of the town's riverfront. 
</P>
<P>
Along the promenade, flagstaffs bearing the ensigns of many nations enliven the 
days, while a glittering array of ornate street lamps help Remagen shine by 
night. The streets leading down to the river from the town center have 
ingenious patterns of red, black and beige cobblestones. 
</P>
<P>
Even if history had not been made at Remagen, its dramatic setting, splendid 
churches and remnants of the Roman era, as well as its many festivals and 
cultural events, would make it an attractive place for travelers who wish to 
avoid the crush at the more popular resorts along the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a memorable evening, have dinner or a drink at a cafe on the 
promenade and look across the Rhine to deep forests on the opposite bank or 
down the river to steep vineyards climbing toward the heights. 
</P>
<P>
Come twilight, watch the red, white and green running lights of the barges 
glimmer across the dark surface of the river. If you do, you will vow to return 
. . . as we did.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: NATURE GETS TOP BILLING IN YUCATAN'S SIAN KA'AN

YUCATAN PENINSULA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were floating on our backs in a swift current toward the sea, treading water 
lazily as the canal carried us through a bulrush marsh that stretched as far as 
the eye could see. 
</P>
<P>
The turquoise shoals of the Caribbean lay six miles east, while an equal 
distance behind us the marsh turned first to mangroves and then to the dense, 
steaming rain forest where our journey had begun. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the crystalline waters of this remarkable system of lagoons and 
canals, carved into the limestone shelf that forms the entire Yucatan 
Peninsula, carried us along its ancient wetland course -- exactly as it carried 
the Mayan traders who dug the canals a millennium or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding a bend, my fantasies of a time warp were shattered by a call from the 
boatmen 30 feet behind us. He was frantically pointing to a spot along the 
canal just ahead of me, flapping his arms and speaking in a rush of Spanish too 
fast for any of us to understand. "Jabiru, jabiru, jabiru!" he seemed to say. 
</P>
<P>
Jabiru? No comprendo. 
</P>
<P>
An ear-shattering screech from an overhanging tree not five feet above my head 
provided the answer. Scrambling to stand against the current, we looked up to 
see two huge, gaping, screaming beaks attached to balls of downy brown 
feathers, both leaning out from their nest in a hissing, screaming, spitting 
display of indignation. 
</P>
<P>
Vaulting into the boat for a camera, we managed to snap off a few shots before 
the current carried us away. The birds, the boatman explained, were very rare 
baby jabiru -- storks -- and the mother has a wingspan of eight to 10 feet 
(hence the flapping of arms). 
</P>
<P>
Hearing this, we decided that the better part of valor was to put some distance 
between us and the little ones before mom decided to pay us a visit. 
</P>
<P>
They call it Sian Ka'an -- which is variously translated from the Mayan as 
"Gateway to Heaven" or "Birth of the Sky." What it is is a miracle by any 
definition -- a 1.3-million-acre "biosphere" that contains a richness of 
archeological, cultural and ecological treasures that would have made the 
conquistadors' unfound pot of gold appear silvery pale in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Mayan archeological sites have been officially identified here, 
including numerous pyramids, temples, canals, highways and entire cities. 
Experts believe some of the best finds might yet remain hidden under the forest 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Some 350 species of birds -- including the endangered stork, a variety of rare 
parrots, keel-billed toucans, ibises, flamingoes, pelicans and great blue 
herons -- call Sian Ka'an home at various times of the year, as do four of the 
world's eight species of endangered sea turtle. 
</P>
<P>
Sea manatees and spiny lobster thrive along Sian Ka'an's two big coastal bays 
and inside its coral reef, the longest in the Western Hemisphere. And the 
forest and mangrove swamps shelter a menagerie of rare and wondrous wildlife -- 
jaguars, howler monkeys, miniature deer, tapirs, ocelots and crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, of course, the 16th-Century conquistadors did find Sian Ka'an 
and its once magnificent cities. But they lacked the vision to see the real 
treasures here, and they settled for merely conquering, converting and 
infecting the peoples they found before repairing to their fortresses to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 400 years or so, Sian Ka'an and the other centers of Mayan culture 
to the west and the south were left much to their own devices, carrying on 
their ancient, if Christian-influenced, traditions, speaking their own 
language, eking out a miserable but independent existence through subsistence 
agriculture and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the early years of this century that the Mexican government 
even attempted to exert its influence in this part of the Yucatan. 
</P>
<P>
Today, only about a thousand Mayans remain in Sian Ka'an, scattered in tiny, 
inaccessible villages in the dense jungle of the interior and a few coastal 
centers, where they have formed farming and fishing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to their own wisdom and the dedicated efforts of environmentalists 
who have won limited protections for Sian Ka'an and other Mayan centers, it now 
appears that these mysterious people and their beautiful, rich land may 
survive, and even accommodate, the latest and most threatening incarnation of 
the conquistadors: the 20th-Century variety known as tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The threat is real, and it grows closer every day. It comes from the inexorable 
pressure for raw materials, cheap labor and untouched expanses of glittering 
Caribbean beachfront emanating from neighboring Cancun, just 80 miles north of 
the northern boundary of Sian Ka'an. 
</P>
<P>
The contrasts between the two regions couldn't be greater -- modern versus 
ancient, congestion versus solitude, glass and concrete versus marsh and 
forest, wealth versus poverty. But for all its glitzy artificiality, Cancun is 
no less "alive" than Sian Ka'an, and it is expanding at the rate of 25% to 30% 
a year, consuming thousands of acres of forest and mile after mile of some of 
the most magnificent sandy beach in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Cancun (appropriately, "nest of serpents" in Mayan) was a 
tiny seaside resort, a mere glint in the eyes of government tourism officials. 
Today it is Mexico's fastest growing city, an instant metropolis of more than 
300,000 permanent residents, most of whom live off the more than 20,000 luxury 
hotel rooms that line its white, talcum-like beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the so-called "Cancun-to-Tulum corridor," the 80-mile strip of 
developed coast that reaches to the northern edge of Sian Ka'an at the ancient 
Mayan seaport of Tulum, provides more tourist accommodations than any place in 
the entire Caribbean, including all of Puerto Rico, according to the proud 
boast of a government tourist official. 
</P>
<P>
It attracts an estimated 2 million visitors a year from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
According to worst-case estimates (or best-case, depending on one's 
perspective), as many as 65,000 more hotel rooms will be constructed along the 
corridor during the next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Given the tragedies of Mayan history, the people of Sian Ka'an and those who 
would protect it are given to taking worst-case estimates seriously. Which is 
why Mayan farmers and fishermen who have never heard of national parks and who 
have practiced ruinous "slash and burn" agriculture for centuries have suddenly 
become ardent conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"For them," said Adela Samper, a representative of a private, nongovernmental 
organization called the Amigos de Sian Ka'an, "conservation isn't an abstract 
or elite idea at all. It's a matter of the life and death of their own 
communities and their way of life." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after years of local and outside environmentalist pressure, the 
government of Mexico declared the entire Sian Ka'an region a Biosphere Reserve, 
thus extending limited but important safeguards against inappropriate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, the United Nations included Sian Ka'an in its international 
network of Biosphere Reserves, mandating that "nucleus" regions be set aside 
for unadulterated conservation and limited scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
Around those zones, a broader "buffer zone" has been defined in which 
indigenous populations may continue to live and exploit natural and touristic 
resources, but only in a highly regulated manner that emphasizes sustainable 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, explained Samper, is relatively new to the conservation movement. 
It differs from national parks in that it recognizes that pure conservation is 
often an inappropriate, if not impossible, option in poverty-stricken Third 
World regions where local tribes have a stake in the land that reaches back 
centuries -- or, in the case of Sian Ka'an, millennia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to come in here and tell the people they can't live over there 
anymore, or hunt in that swamp or fish in that bay, they'd just ignore us -- as 
they should," Samper said. "So the idea of a biosphere is to work very closely 
with the local people, to gain their trust and help them find ways to survive 
and even improve their lot without doing further damage to the land." 
</P>
<P>
At Sian Ka'an, this approach has led to the establishment of a demonstration 
farm that teaches intensive methods of cultivation and crop rotation as an 
alternative to slash-and-burn, and the creation of marketing co-ops in the 
fishing communities, along with strict monitoring and regulation of the lobster 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an even larger Mayan region, known as Calakmul, was declared a 
biosphere in the southern Yucatan on the Guatemalan border. It adjoins 
Guatemala's first biosphere, and the two may soon be joined by a small 
biosphere candidate in northern Belize. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they would comprise a much-hoped-for, three-nation "Mayan Peace Park" 
totaling some five million acres . . . twice the size of Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of this union of the Mayan biospheres -- a plan known as La Ruta Maya 
-- hope that parts of El Salvador and Honduras will also join in the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
They envision a futuristic system of "eco-tourism" for the entire Mayan region 
that would allow thousands of visitors to pass through the fragile forests and 
major archeological sites via a carefully regulated network of guided bus tours 
and monorails that would leave the environment relatively unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, unguided tourist incursions into the Mayan reserves remain 
difficult and hazardous at best, given the lack of paved roads or 
accommodations. Even backpacking is out of the question for most of Sian Ka'an, 
where the rain forest is virtually impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean, of course, that the determined bird watcher, amateur 
archeologist, anthropologist, or just plain rabid, must-see-everything tourist 
can't enjoy Sian Ka'an. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the biosphere concept is to promote limited tourism for the benefit of 
the reserve itself," said Sampan, noting that the Friends of Sian Ka'an, with 
financial support from the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, even 
has a director of "ecotourism." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the organization started conducting one-day tours for up 
to six people at a time through one of the more accessible and archeologically 
significant portions of the reserve -- a tour I will always remember as the Day 
of the Screaming Storks. 
</P>
<P>
Setting out from Cancun, our group drove for 1 1/2 hours south to Tulum, past 
the expanse of oceanfront luxury resorts. A few miles south of Tulum, at the 
little resort of Chac Mool, we left the paved road and entered the reserve on 
our way to Chunyaxche (Muyil in Spanish), an inland seaport first settled 
around the year AD 1, according to the Tulane University archeologists working 
there with local Mayan helpers. 
</P>
<P>
Even before reaching the main ruins, we could glimpse through openings in the 
forest the rough outlines of ancient stone structures that have not yet been 
cleared of centuries of overgrowth. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the dirt road, we left our van and, after dousing ourselves with 
insect repellent to ward off the mosquitoes, we set off for a short hike down a 
narrow path slashed through the dense forest. 
</P>
<P>
Recent excavations have revealed centuries-old structures of varying sizes 
spaced about every 25 yards along the pathway. 
</P>
<P>
No guards were anywhere to be seen, no rangers, no T-shirt concessionaires, no 
officials or even signs of any sort to tell us not to scamper to the top of the 
crumbling pyramid temples and poke our heads into dark recesses, frightening 
Gila monsters and ourselves. We had only our guide from Amigos and our own 
sense of what was appropriate to limit our explorations. 
</P>
<P>
From Chunyaxche we drove down a narrow rutted road to Muyil Lagoon, a 
freshwater lake that begins the old water route to the sea, some 15 miles east. 
There, at the end of a rickety dock, four Mayan children splashed in the water 
and played in a dugout canoe -- a miniature replica of those their ancestors 
used centuries ago -- while their fathers, our boatmen, patiently waited our 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A quick trip across the lagoon brought us to the entrance to the first of a 
series of Mayan-built canals -- about four feet wide, just enough for the boat 
to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
These artificial canals, not discovered by Europeans until the 1920s, spill 
finally into Laguna Chunyaxche, a large lake surrounded by marsh and mangrove. 
Crossing it, we entered yet another series of canals, known as Xlahpak, these 
being natural instead of man-made and eight to ten feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
As we coursed closer to the sea, the current grew stronger, allowing us to shut 
down the outboard and drift, enjoying the silence, interrupted only by the 
occasional cry of herons or excited exclamations over the sighting of a king 
vulture or other exotic bird. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, looming up out of nowhere in the reeds ahead, a 1,000-year-old 
building appeared just 15 feet from the canal. Built of massive carved stones, 
its intricate decorative detail was easily visible from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The boatman explained that it was nothing more significant than an ordinary 
guardhouse along a route that once carried thousands of traders from the rich 
Mayan seaports of Guatemala and Belize to the interior settlements at Muyil and 
on to Copa, a major Mayan city far inland. 
</P>
<P>
Growing hot, a few of us plunged into the canal, drifting for perhaps a mile 
downstream until the noisy complaints of the jabiru sent us scampering back 
into the boat for the remainder of the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the last canal empties into Laguna Boca Paia, actually a long narrow 
bay that opens through a 500-foot-wide barrier reef into the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the boat at the lagoon side of the reef, we wandered up a well-worn 
trail to the opposite, ocean-side shore, discovering ourselves smack in the 
middle of a little fishing resort, served by a dirt road that runs the length 
of the reef. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen small, thatched cabanas were tucked under waving palms 100 feet 
from the surf, and as many outboard fishing boats were moored at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
The road that runs down the 25-mile reef passes maybe a half-dozen such 
resorts, as well as a dozen or more private, beachfront homes, before it ends 
in Punta Allen, a small Mayan fishing port within the reserve that produces 
about 65 tons of U.S.-bound lobster tails each year. 
</P>
<P>
The properties are private and predate the establishment of the reserve, so 
they're permitted to continue to operate under casual supervision. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, we were back amid the comforts of Cancun, and entire world removed 
from the "Gateway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Amigos de Sian Ka'an charges $85 per person for the one-day tour in the 
reserve. Arrangements can be made through most major hotels in Cancun or, 
better, by writing to Amigos de Sian Ka'an, Apartado Postal 770, Cancun 77500, 
Quintana Roo, Mexico.

HIKING: THERE'S DEFINITE CATCH TO SAN GABRIEL TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a century, Southern California fishermen have been hooking trout 
in the San Gabriel River. The Pasadena Bait Club was the most prominent of 
several early fishing camps catering to those looking for camaraderie, rustic 
accommodations and good fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Downriver, the San Gabriel (along with its sister streams the Santa Ana and the 
Los Angeles) is best known for depositing the alluvium that now covers the 
surface of the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Upriver, the San Gabriel has two major forks, each with a claim to fame. East 
Fork is known for its gold, West Fork for its trout. 
</P>
<P>
The 1890s were a particularly grand time to cast a line. But while most anglers 
caught no more than the limit (50!), others were greedy and some even used 
dynamite to "fish" for trout. California Gov. Henry H. Markham was hardly an 
example of the conservation-minded sportsman; he once landed 98 fish in six 
hours on the West Fork. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the California Department of Fish and Game stepped in to enforce 
limits and replenish the West Fork with fingerlings and trout brought in from 
Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Today, West Fork -- its course determined by one of Southern California's most 
significant faults, the San Gabriel -- is one of the best fishing rivers in 
Southern California. Most of the West Fork has been set aside as a wild trout 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing is of the "catch and release" variety. Barbless hooks must be used and 
the daily limit is zero. Fishing for keeps is permitted along a portion of the 
West Fork -- the first 1 1/2-mile stretch of river reached by trail from 
Highway 39. 
</P>
<P>
West Fork, as trout habitat, is still recovering from the desilting of Cogswell 
Dam, which lies upriver. Some years ago, during less enlightened times, 
Cogswell Dam was cleaned out and tons of silt were dumped into West Fork, 
wiping out most of the fish population. 
</P>
<P>
The river can be reached from a couple of different directions, but most 
fishermen, as well as hikers and bicyclists, join the West Fork National Scenic 
Trail that departs from Highway 39. The trail is actually an asphalt road built 
at the same time as Cogswell Dam. Closed to vehicle traffic, the road is 
popular with hikers, joggers and mountain bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
West Fork Trail meanders seven miles with the river to Glenn Camp. (The road 
continues another 1 1/2 miles past Glenn Camp to Cogswell Reservoir, which is 
closed to the public, and connects with Forest Service fire roads heading 
west.) Hikers can travel the entire way to Glenn Camp or stop at a picnic or 
fishing spot anywhere they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: Weekend and holiday visitors to the popular San 
Gabriel Canyon area must obtain a parking permit ($3 a day) for parking along 
Highway 39, as far as the Crystal Lake turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
You can get a permit from the Forest Service San Gabriel Entrance Station, open 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; early risers can buy their permits at 
Daily Donuts or Circle Mobile Mart on Azusa Avenue in Azusa. These businesses 
are open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, exit on Azusa Avenue (Highway 39) and 
drive north. Fourteen miles later, and half a mile past the Forest Service's 
San Gabriel Canyon Off Road Vehicle Area and Rincon Station, look for a parking 
lot and locked gate on your left. Signed West Fork National Scenic Trail is the 
asphalt road descending into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Walk past the locked gate and down the road into the canyon. On the 
weekends, you'll have plenty of company along the first mile of trail. Most of 
these canyon visitors will be toting coolers, lawn chairs and fishing poles. 
</P>
<P>
After a mile there is a flat area, the site of the Pasadena Bait Club. The 
fishermen's headquarters burned in 1924, and the ruins washed away during the 
flood of 1938. 
</P>
<P>
The path intersects the unsigned Bear Creek Trail that leads north into the San 
Gabriel Wilderness. Pioneers had many an encounter with grizzlies along this 
creek, hence the name. After another half-mile, the trail again crosses the 
river and enters the designated wild trout preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Upriver, the road, which climbs very slowly but steadily, leads past many 
tranquil oak- and sycamore-shaded pools. 
</P>
<P>
Seven miles from the trailhead is Glenn Camp, set on a shady flat right by the 
river. It's a peaceful place with half-a-dozen tables that invite a picnic. 
</P>

TRAVEL VIDEOS: NAVIGATING THE 'CITY OF SAILS' IN NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Touring New Zealand" (Questar Video, 70 minutes, 1989) is best suited for the 
armchair traveler, although it's helpful for early travel planning. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, in the Bay of Islands on the northern tip of North Island, was the 
first capital of New Zealand. Here the film visits the Treaty House in 
Waitangi, where the 1840 treaty between the British and Maoris was signed; the 
shipwreck museum, Kemp House, Rewa's Maori Village and the Cape Reinga 
Lighthouse. Side trips are to the Waipoua Kauri Forest and a drive along 
90-Mile Beach. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, is known as the "city of sails" because 
one in every four households owns a yacht. Shown are views of the city skyline, 
the aquarium and activities along New Zealand's longest river, the Waikato. 
</P>
<P>
In the central area of North Island, the camera shows Cambridge, a town that 
mirrors the British influence, and the Waitomo Caves, with their glowworm 
grotto. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also are shown the thermal area of Rotorua, with its spewing geysers 
and boiling mud pools, the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute and the buried 
village, which was destroyed by lava from the Tarawera volcano in 1886. 
</P>
<P>
Sheep shearing and trout fishing in the Lake Taupo area are part of the film, 
as are Tongariro National Park; Gisborne, where Capt. Cook landed; Napier, 
which was destroyed by a 1931 earthquake; Hawke's Bay wineries, and Mt. Egmont. 
</P>
<P>
Wellington, which is similar to San Francisco with its charming old buildings, 
hills and harbor, lies at the southern tip of North Island and is the country's 
capital. From Wellington, the ferry travels across Cook Strait to Picton on 
South Island. 
</P>
<P>
Between Picton and Christchurch, there's a visit to the old mining towns of 
Shantytown and Mitchell's Gully; Hikitika, a small town noted for its jade, and 
Kaikoura, an old whaling center. 
</P>
<P>
A Christchurch tour includes Cathedral Square, many of the beautiful gardens 
and the Canterbury Museum. Brief visits to Akaroa, an early French settlement, 
Mt. Cook National Park and the Tasman Glacier, and Westland National Park, with 
its unusual ice sculptures, also are included. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Queenstown includes 54-mile Lake Wakatipu, the ghost town of 
Arrowtown and Lake Hayes, in addition to Haast Pass, Mt. Aspiring National Park 
and Lake Wanaka. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent fiordland and the spectacular scenery of Lake Te Anau, the Milford 
Track, Milford Sound and Sutherland Falls is shown at the end. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from Questar Travel Network, P.O. Box 11345, Chicago, Ill. 
60611, (800) 544-8422. Price: $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Australia" (Rand McNally VideoTrips, Best Films and Video Corp., 50 minutes, 
1988) is a well-photographed whirlwind tour of five Australian cities, along 
with brief scenes of the Outback and Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the camera hits such landmarks as the harbor bridge and opera house 
and also visits St. James Church, the Australian Museum of Aboriginal Art, Hyde 
Park, the Argyle Arts Center and the Queen Victoria Building mall. 
</P>
<P>
Stops are made at shops in the restored Rocks area; in the King's Cross 
district with its restaurants, discos and strip joints, and in Paddington, an 
upscale neighborhood for Sydney yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Circular Quay and the Taronga Park Zoo, plus views of the Bondi and Manly 
beaches, also are included. 
</P>
<P>
The British influence is apparent in Melbourne, a center of finance, fashion 
and theater. Stops include the city's Golden Mile, stock exchange, jail museum 
and railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown, the Victoria outdoor market and the cultural complex at the Victoria 
Arts Center on the Yarra River are shown, as are the Royal Botanic, Queen 
Victoria and Fitzroy gardens. 
</P>
<P>
In Adelaide, the film covers the Barossa Valley wineries, as well as a tour of 
the city center, the South Australian Museum of Aboriginal Art, the botanical 
gardens and festival center. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Perth includes scenes of its skyline, the Swan River, the commercial 
center along St. George's Terrace, the London Court shopping arcade and King's 
Park. In Fremantle, the video pauses at the Fremantle and Maritime museums. 
Resorts on Rottnest Island are seen from the air. 
</P>
<P>
In the Queensland area, the video visits Cairns for game fishing, the Great 
Barrier Reef, and the resort facilities on Hamilton Island. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with scenes of the Outback and Ayers Rock, plus a brief 
look at Tasmania, and a roundup of travel information on car rentals, weather, 
visas, currency and some hotel hints. 
</P>
<P>
The tape is available from Best Films and Video Corp., P.O. Box 1179, Gillette, 
Wyo. 82716, (800) 248-7477. Price: $19.95.

SINGLE TRAVELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now I know: Single people do get cheated when it comes to room distribution on 
a tour. 
</P>
<P>
We pay extra but come up with less. On a recent tour, nearly every night my 
room faced rear buildings so close that I had to keep blinds closed. Roofs 
and/or balconies were so close that I locked my windows and doors and spent the 
night in an airless room. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining to the tour guide and desk was of no use. Several times I looked at 
couples' rooms to see a view of lake or mountains. I wish tour companies and 
hotels would consider single travelers, especially women, as people, too.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: ORLANDO PAMPHLET IS SLIM ON IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Orlando dropped its off-season special rates for seniors some time 
ago and instead offers a free pamphlet listing senior discounts and bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Published by the Orlando/Orange County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, the 
pamphlet is called "Orlando -- Golden Magic Years." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the eight-page publication is woefully slim in size and scope on 
money-saving tips for mature travelers heading for one of the world's most 
popular tourist destinations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there are only 14 accommodations listed despite the hundreds of 
hotels, motels, inns and other accommodations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet does list a few condominium bargains that readers might not find 
in the Mobil or AAA guides, both of which consistently state whether senior 
discounts are available in their more extensive accommodation listings. 
</P>
<P>
And the booklet does mention the Ramada Inn at Altamonte Springs, which has a 
senior plan worth noting. It gives a 25% senior discount for double occupancy, 
plus 50 cents off the discounted rate for each year the visitor is past age 55. 
For those 65, that's another $5 off plus the discount. 
</P>
<P>
That's a better price break to lure the true seniors, who are all too often 
lumped into the same discount bracket as millions of AARP and Mature Outlook 
members, many of whom are 50 years old and still employed. 
</P>
<P>
There is a similar shortage of attractions and dining recommendations in the 
booklet. Busch Gardens, Sea World and Universal Studios are noted. 
Conspicuously absent, however, is Walt Disney World and Epcot, which provide a 
"Magic Years Club" for seniors age 60 and over. 
</P>
<P>
According to the pamphlet, there are only six restaurants in the entire Orlando 
area offering senior discounts. Only one car rental agency and one airline are 
noted as providing senior deals. 
</P>
<P>
All this points out one of the shortcomings of such guides put out by area 
chambers of commerce or visitors bureaus: They are published for their members. 
There can be fine senior deals at accommodations, attractions, etc., in the 
area, but if those businesses are not dues-paying members, they are not listed. 
</P>
<P>
One possibly helpful feature in Orlando's pamphlet is its listing of medical 
services, medical supply and rental companies, drug stores and pharmacies. None 
of the 19 such listings are noted as offering discounts, however. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for the 16 shopping areas listed, although the location and 
opening hours of several malls, flea markets and browse-and-buy areas are 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Orlando's "Golden Magic Days" pamphlet is marginally helpful, better 
than nothing at all and just about worth the 25-cent stamp. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain a copy, write to Golden Magic Days, Orlando/Orange County Convention 
&amp; Visitors Bureau, 7208 Sand Lake Road, Suite 300, Orlando, Fla. 32819.

FOOTLOOSE: NAXOS IS GREENEST OF THE GREEK ISLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NAXOS, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This largest, greenest and most beautiful of the Cycladic Islands, with its 
abundant water supply and rich farmlands, is one of the most pleasing and 
rewarding stops in the Aegean. 
</P>
<P>
And, thanks to the lack of an airport (Naxians say they don't have enough votes 
in parliament), it is far less crowded than better-known Greek isles. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Pan Am, TWA or KLM to Athens, all with stops. Olympic Airways 
flies nonstop from New York City, then on to the island of Paros, just three 
miles from Naxos. An LAX-Athens round-trip, advance-purchase ticket will cost 
between $1,010 and $1,110, depending upon month and day of week flown. 
Olympic's 45-minute Athens-Paros leg is $53 one way, and the three-mile ferry 
ride to Naxos is a pittance. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Naxos a day or two, perhaps another for excursions into 
the island or a day-trip to Paros. Lodging costs are moderate and the marvelous 
Greek dining is inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Greece's drachma recently sold at 161 to the dollar, about 
.0062 each. Best time for a visit is between May and the end of November. While 
northern and central Greece may have severe winter weather, the islands have 
mild winters with temperatures in the mid-50s and 60s. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Nissaki, St. George Beach; $41 B&amp;B double, high 
season, $35 low season. Just 300 yards from town on the seashore, it has 15 
sparkling but simple bedrooms furnished in white pine. It's small, comfortable, 
and has a colorful taverna inside, plus a beachside cafe with tables on the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
Galaxy Hotel, St. George Beach (same prices as Nissaki), is almost a clone of 
the Nissaki except that it is larger and has a few more amenities, including a 
pool, air conditioning and cable TV. Even its architecture features the 
stark-white cubes favored by island hotels. The Galaxy is just a short walk 
from the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Chateau Zevgoli, Old Town hill; $42 B&amp;B double, high season, $36 low 
season, is a traditional pension with 10 rooms, most having beautiful lapis 
doorways around a small flower-filled courtyard. Old ceiling beams, a beehive 
fireplace and antiques give the Zevgoli the warm look of a bygone era. A short 
walk down the hill are the town's best restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Apart from its good wines, Naxos turns out excellent 
cheeses, including a Gruyere-type and various chevres. 
</P>
<P>
The best bet for dining is always fresh seafood. Try barbounis, a red mullet 
loaded with small bones; octopus, either marinated cold or grilled; calamari 
(squid) and calamarakia (baby squid); fresh sardines grilled or fried, and 
plenty of lobster. 
</P>
<P>
Good local dining: Nikos Restaurant and Coffee Bar (over the Commercial Bank 
near the port) is a gathering place for those who want to socialize and enjoy 
good seafood. It has an outdoor garden-terrace and a huge indoor area from 
which diners can visit the kitchen and smoking grills. The mezes (Greek 
appetizers) and swordfish are excellent. At Nikos, vacationers also can catch 
up on Greek dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Taverna Lucullus (near the market in Old Town), hidden away in a labyrinth of 
narrow streets, has been one of the town's best dining spots since opening in 
1908. It's a study in taverna furnishings: simple blue furniture, walls covered 
with local artifacts and weavings, ceramics and game skins. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Greek dishes, the taverna serves half a dozen types of grilled 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
Other tavernas with typical Greek food, grills and fresh seafood are Taverna 
Klimataria (near the post office) and Red Lion (St. George Beach), which also 
has a garden. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start exploring with a walk up the hill to the Kastro (citadel) 
and its Roman Catholic cathedral. The cathedral has a full-figure Byzantine 
icon on the high altar that may be turned in its frame to show the Virgin and 
Child on one side and John the Baptist on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hill is the Naxos Museum, noted for its six Cycladic figures, bead 
jewelry, Greco-Roman amphoras and, on the roof, a 4th-Century Hellenistic 
mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond the harbor is Palace Island (Palatia), which has the beginnings of 
a 6th-Century BC Temple of Apollo that was never finished. Although a causeway 
connects Palace Island to the quay, the temple's imposing entryway is best 
appreciated from afar. 
</P>
<P>
St. George Beach is a comfortable walk from town, with other superb beaches at 
Mikri Vigla and Kastraki. Like almost all Greek beaches, they're topless. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Contact the Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 W. 
6th St., Suite 2198, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696, for a brochure on the 
Cycladic Islands, including Naxos, a map of Greece and an Athens brochure. Ask

WHY FIGHT FOR OIL AND RICH EMIRS? 
</P>

<P>
This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- occasional articles written by 
college students on issues pressing to them. 
</P>
<P>
During the early days of basic training at the Naval Training Center in 
Orlando, Fla., I remember being asked: "Would you die -- and kill -- for the 
sake of your country?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," I yelled, obediently. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought again about those days and what had I said. After basic, I 
returned home and began college. But at a two-week training exercise for the 
Navy reserves last week, I heard that question again, only this time it was 
less abstract: "Are you ready to go to the Middle East and kill a few ragheads 
for our national interest?" 
</P>
<P>
"National interest"? "Ragheads"? My hesitation to answer was as troubling to my 
senior officer as the question was to me. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was clear to me -- 3 1/2 years after basic and now a petty officer 
second class in the Navy reserves -- that I couldn't be truly "combat ready" if 
activated. The reason: My education and military training don't mix. 
</P>
<P>
I joined the Navy at the end of my high-school senior year to supplement my 
college education. I thought that serving part time in the military while 
attending college would offer me two vividly contrasting perspectives. I would 
be a stronger individual as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But after studying political science and journalism at Moravian College, and 
applying what I'd learned to the crisis in the Persian Gulf, I discovered that 
the Navy and college went together like, well, oil and water. The last thing 
this college reservist is, is "combat ready" -- mentally and physically 
prepared to be ready, on 48-hours notice, to go anywhere and do anything asked 
of me. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty is my upbringing. While growing up, I blindly accepted 
much of the patriotism and most of the nationalistic values that were passed on 
to me by my family -- grandfather was a gunner's mate in WWII, my uncle an Army 
officer in Vietnam -- of veterans. My friends never challenged them, either. 
</P>
<P>
During military training, my senior officers reinforced many of these values, 
as did my fellow trainees. For many of them, the "stated" ends -- freedom, 
democracy and our lifestyle -- justified what I soon learned to be the implicit 
means -- imperialism, aggression and occasional exploitation of smaller, weaker 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
I always had some doubts about mindless loyalty. But they were mostly vague -- 
until I completed several college courses on U.S. foreign policy, international 
relations, Third World politics and political economy. They were further 
intensified after spending a semester in Washington, D.C., where I worked on 
Capitol Hill for a popular congressman. I watched elected officials devote 
countless hours catering to special interests just to raise money for their 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Having had such experiences, I now wonder what my role in the reserves is. Did 
I join the reserves to protect U.S. soil from foreign invasion, as did my 
grandfather? I thought so. 
</P>
<P>
Or does being in the reserves mean protecting "oil reserves" and the pride of 
super-rich emirs thousands of miles away? Does mobilization, in fact, mean 
Mobil-ization? And should I again mindlessly yell "Yes, sir!" as congressmen, 
champions of special interests, mouth support for our buildup in the Persian 
Gulf? 
</P>
<P>
The military helps pay -- $140 a month -- for my education. But, ironically, 
that education inspired me to question the very ends the military is called on 
to serve. I don't remember seeing a clause in the GI Bill prohibiting me from 
taking courses that encourage skepticism toward government policy. Yet whenever 
I question the government's vague ends, the usual reaction I hear is one of 
utter contempt: "You're not being patriotic." "You're not willing to pay my 
dues." "Love it or leave it." "My country, wrong or right." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps my questions are hard to answer. Perhaps they make others 
uncomfortable. I do love my country. I do believe in freedom and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
But now that President Bush has called up the reserves, my need for satisfying 
answers is especially pressing. As a member of a construction battalion -- I'm 
trained to operate the heavy equipment frequently used in building airstrips -- 
my unit is probably more likely than many others to be called for duty. Is it 
essential to being patriotic and a "contributing" member of the military to be 
"combat ready"?

SADDAM HUSSEIN'S ULTIMATE FIFTH COLUMN -- TERRORISTS; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: THAT OLD GANG OF BOMBERS AND ASSASSINS HAS ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THE 
IRAQI LEADER AND ARE READY TO DO HIS BIDDING IN EUROPE AND MIDEAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

International Security and Defense Policy Research Program.

<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Middle East is like none the United States has ever faced. 
Saddam Hussein has rewritten the rules of modern warfare by taking thousands of 
Western hostages in his ruthless quest for Iraqi Lebensraum -- and then by 
deploying them as human shields. Equally disquieting is the likelihood that the 
Iraqi leader has created the ultimate "fifth column": an international 
terrorist army, arrayed throughout Europe and the Middle East, ready to strike 
at his command. 
</P>
<P>
Ominiously, there are signs that he is preparing to unleash a campaign of 
international terrorism in hopes of breaking the international quarantine and 
military buildup that has isolated Iraq and is strangling its economy. 
</P>
<P>
Since the spring, the most radical, hard-line Palestinian terrorist 
organizations have been moving their operational bases to Iraq. One after 
another, familiar faces have turned up in Baghdad: Abul Abbas, the mastermind 
behind the October, 1985, hijacking of the Italian cruise ship, Achille Lauro; 
Abu Nidal, the architect of the brutal machine-gun and hand-grenade attacks on 
the Rome and Vienna airports in December, 1985, and an Istanbul synagogue in 
September, 1986; and Ahmad Jabril, whose followers allegedly placed the bomb 
that brought down Pan Am flight 103 in December, 1988. According to one foreign 
intelligence estimate, there are now some 1,400 international terrorists in 
Iraq -- twice the number of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Abbas issued a proclamation ordering his men to attack U.S. 
interests around the world, in general, and American forces in Saudi Arabia, in 
particular. "Open fire on the American enemy everywhere," he declared. "Quake 
the earth under the feet of the invaders and collaborators." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by a rival's clarion call to battle, Nidal immediately 
followed suit, warning that his organization was preparing to carry out "90 
attacks in 20 countries" against U.S. and Western targets. 
</P>
<P>
The first evidence of the new alliance between Iraq and the radical 
Palestinians surfaced last May, when the Israeli navy thwarted an attack on Tel 
Aviv by members of Abbas' organization traveling in speedboats. According to 
the surviving terrorists, Libya had provided training and logistical support. 
But it was Iraq that had planned and paid for the attack -- whose targets 
included the beach-front U.S. embassy. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, intelligence analysts were puzzled by Hussein's motives in wooing 
the terrorists to Baghdad, ascribing his intentions, if at all, to his desire 
to supplant Libya's Col. Moammar Kadafi as international terrorism's chief 
benefactor. In retrospect, however, it appears that Hussein has been building 
an Iraqi-backed, brokered and controlled international terrorist 
infrastructure. With such an infrastructure already in place, he may well have 
created the ultimate "fifth column," which, in a series of sharp, bloody, and 
destructive attacks, may have been the power to shatter the current standoff in 
the gulf by eroding both international and -- perhaps, more importantly -- the 
American public's support for military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein certainly remembers that a terrorist campaign orchestrated by Iran in 
Beirut between 1983 and 1984 undermined American support for a U.S. military 
presence in Lebanon and thus led to the collapse of the multinational 
peace-keeping force sent to that country. This lesson must figure prominently 
in his strategy to deal with the U.S.-backed multinational force currently 
deployed in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
International terrorism is perhaps the most cost-effective weapon in Iraq's 
arsenal. Rather than having to expend his military might in direct combat with 
U.S. and allied forces in Saudi Arabia and the gulf, Hussein could covertly 
dispatch his terrorist minions to strike at considerably more vulnerable 
civilian, diplomatic or airline targets throughout Europe and the Middle East. 
His range of potential targets -- and victims -- would be restricted only by 
the reach and numerical strength of his terrorist infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
A carefully planned and well-executed Iraqi-backed terrorist campaign could 
also be a decisive weapon to destabilize -- or even destroy -- the governments 
of those Arab countries that oppose Iraq's territorial designs. Hussein could 
thus accomplish with a few men and bombs what it took his army to do in Kuwait. 
At the very least, such a campaign could wear down the resolve of the 
pro-Western countries in the region to continue to support a U.S. military 
presence in Saudi Arabia and trade sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A chain of terrorist attacks throughout Europe and the Middle East would 
certainly be grist for Hussein's propaganda mill. In each case, the Iraqi 
president would deny any responsibility for or connection to the incident, even 
expressing surprise. But it is easy to imagine Iraqi officials smugly lauding 
such a "spontaneous outburst of anti-Western, anti-imperialist, anit-Zionist 
sentiment" against U.S. and Western interest by Iraq's Arab brethren scattered 
around the world. In light of our past hesitancy to retaliate against 
state-sponsors of international terrorism without incontrovertible evidence 
directly linking them to an attack, this ruse could conceivably enable Iraq to 
escape retribution. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, if Hussein remains in power and if Iraq retains its military might, 
other renegade regional powers will feel able to deploy thousands of civilian 
hostages as human shields and to deprive diplomats of their traditional 
protected status. Unconventional tactics -- such as international terrorism -- 
will then become institutionalized as instruments of modern warfare.

PERSIAN GULF TURMOIL, PUT THE SQUEEZE ON FRAGILE ECONOMIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The fragile democracies of Eastern Europe are being dealt twin blows by the 
petroleum crises in the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf. The sudden reality 
is that these countries cannot afford to import vitally needed oil at today's 
soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Eastern Europe -- Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, 
Bulgaria and East Germany -- depended to an overwhelming degree on Soviet 
petroleum and natural-gas deliveries, financed by subsidies and barter through 
Comecon, the East-Bloc common market. Eastern Europe was thus sheltered from 
the great oil shocks of the '70s that hit Western economies so painfully . 
</P>
<P>
When the fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe began preparing early this 
year for fundamental shifts from central planning to free-market economies -- 
shifts calling for unprecedented austerity and social and personal sacrifices 
-- they continued to enjoy cheap oil and easy eastward exports. They assumed 
that the transition from the old trade patterns with the Soviets to new ones 
would be long enough to cushion their economies. There seemed to be no reason 
for Moscow to upset existing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial assumption was that oil would remain available in needed volume and 
at an affordable rate. But the effects of vast economic changes in the Soviet 
Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika caught East Europeans 
unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring the Soviets announced that starting Jan. 1, 1991, all exports to 
Eastern Europe, including oil, would have to be paid at world prices and in 
hard currency, such as U.S. dollars or German marks. While the Soviets promised 
to pay in hard currency for East Europe imports, their purchases dropped 
precipitously. Overnight, Polish potato farmers lost their Soviet markets, as 
did the Hungarian manufacturers of Ikarus buses. 
</P>
<P>
The hard fact was that Moscow could no longer afford to subsidize the former 
satellites, desperately needing hard currency to finance its own vital imports 
from the West, such as grain and high technology. 
</P>
<P>
Just as East Europe countries adjusted to the hard-currency realities of their 
new relations with the Soviet Union, things got worse. Domestic upheavals in 
the Soviet Union cut 1989-90 petroleum production, and Moscow decided last May 
to reduce its oil deliveries to Eastern Europe by about a third. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the cut in shipments, the East Europeans were already calculating 
that their annual hard-currency expenditures would double this year to meet the 
Soviet fuel bill. Before the Persian Gulf conflict, these governments 
calculated that for 1990-91 they would need at least $6 billion in additional 
dollar earnings to pay for imported energy. East Germany, of course, will be 
removed from immediate peril by its absorption by West Germany, now set for 
Oct. 3. But elsewhere economic and social tensions have risen as retail 
gasoline prices shoot up; lengthy queues at stations brought back memories of 
the communist days. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern that fuel shortages may diminish Western tourism, a basic 
source of hard-currency for Eastern Europe. Even at July oil prices, economists 
were projecting a surge in inflation and a reduction in industrial output. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, world oil prices jumped from $16 
to more than $30 per barrel of benchmark crude oil, rendering it virtually 
impossible for East Europeans to buy the petroleum they need. Governments began 
to realize that even if prices did not keep climbing, they had to rethink all 
their fundamental economic planning. The only beneficiary of the new situation 
was the Soviet Union, whose hard-currency income from oil exports virtually 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The worst hit were Bulgaria and Poland. Iraq was indebted to Bulgaria for $1 
billion and to Poland for $500-million, in payment for large-scale engineering 
works and arms, in Poland's case. Iraq was paying off the debt in crude oil; 
the U.N.-imposed embargo -- fully supported by the two governments -- has 
effectively shut off this source of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it should be a top priority for the United States and 
its Western partners to develop measures and policies to protect Eastern Europe 
from the new oil shocks. It would be morally and politically intolerable if the 
Eastern European nations, newly freed from nearly 50 years of communist 
dictatorship, were allowed to founder in economic chaos and social unrest as a 
result of oil shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, aware of Poland's latest economic troubles and of the 
need to prevent social unrest certain to play in the hands of rightist 
political radicals, has taken preliminary measures to alleviate the oil 
problem. Among them, it has sought to establish a relationship between Warsaw 
and Saudi Arabia, in the hope that might help the Poles work out a favorable 
import arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has also looked into the possibility that oil belonging to 
Kuwait, now on ships at sea, might some way be diverted to Poland. But the 
government turned down Poland's request to forgive part of its debt, fearing it 
would have set an unfavorable precedent for other debtor nations. Latin 
America, for example, has also been hit by rising oil prices, and carries 
enormous debts. 
</P>
<P>
In a worst-case scenario, the emergence of right-wing, dictatorial regimes 
throughout Eastern Europe is possible if tension and frustration sweep the 
region. Profound splits within democratic forces are already occuring in 
several of these countries; economic catastrophes could push them over the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
A concerted plan by the United States, Western Europe and Japan is urgently 
needed to prop up the imperiled Eastern European democracies. Innovative 
policies must be launched, or else the West risks losing Eastern Europe for a 
second time in this century.

WITH ALL MIDEAST ARMED, CRISIS SITS ATOP POWDERKEG; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: ISRAEL HAS NUCLEAR AND CHEMICAL ARMS, IRAQ HAS CHEMICAL AND 
BIOLOGICAL, OTHERS ARE ALSO ARMED -- AND THRESHOLDS FOR ACTION ARE UNKNOWNS.

<P>
The key players in this month's Middle East crisis all have weapons of mass 
destruction: a blanket term for nuclear, chemical and biological arms that kill 
huge amounts of people with impersonal, indiscriminate bluntness. And so, a new 
study by two strategic analysts at Britain's Bradford University warns that any 
war that develops "could have massive and unpredictable consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly dangerous is the fact that the thresholds, or limits to an army's 
tolerance, are unknown. Conventional warfare, using bullets and grenades, would 
be bad enough; but what would it take to bring on the mass destruction? 
</P>
<P>
What would prompt Iraq's Saddam Hussein to unleash chemical or biological 
weapons in the current confrontation? Where is the threshold at which Israel 
would feel it must use a nuclear bomb? Could any level of threat or actual 
violence justify use of tactical nuclear weapons -- even a high-radiation, 
low-blast neutron bomb -- by the U.S. forces now in the gulf? 
</P>
<P>
These questions have been troubling Israeli policy-makers for years. They do 
not confirm publicly that they have a nuclear arsenal, but Western intelligence 
analysts believe Israel has more than 100 nuclear bombs of various sizes and 
types. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's obvious willingness to use weapons of mass destruction -- seen in the 
poison-gas attacks on Iranian soldiers and Iraqi Kurds suspected of disloyalty 
during the Iran-Iraq War -- add an extra dimension to Hussein's grab for glory 
this month. Israeli strategists fear that Hussein's ultimate goal goes far 
beyond the oil wealth of captured Kuwait or Western-backed Saudi Arabia, 
extending all the way to the destruction of the Jewish State. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis are concerned that Saddam might order his army to lob a chemical or 
biological shell toward Israel, without regard to a missile's accuracy, simply 
to shake up the pot and start a wider war that might unite all Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
In war games and joint analysis of options by Israeli and U.S. experts, they 
consider an Iraqi attack on Israel to be a worst-case scenario -- but a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have been tempted to launch a preemptive strike, especially when 
their intelligence agencies report Iraq is only five years away from developing 
a nuclear bomb. But they appear to accept that they cannot indefinitely enforce 
the so-called Begin Doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
It was in June, 1981, that Prime Minister Menachem Begin sent the Israeli air 
force on its then-longest bombing raid: to destroy the nuclear reactor that 
France had supplied to Iraq. Begin's nightmares of the Nazi Holocaust prompted 
him to declare the enemies of Israel and the Jewish people must never be 
allowed to obtain weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, intelligence reports say the Iraqis have spread their secret 
military facilities around the country and "hardened" them underground to make 
them less vulnerable to air attack. In addition, Israelis say Hussein sounded 
serious in April, when he threatened to destroy half of Israel with chemical 
weapons if the "Zionists" dared to attack. 
</P>
<P>
It was startling to hear Hussein confirm that he had these weapons, but Iraqi 
officials said they were merely trying to match Israel's military superiority. 
Western analysts call chemical and biological arms "the poor man's nuclear 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
If Hussein and other Arabs continue to be convinced that Israel could destroy 
them, would that deter war? It was Israel, after all, that introduced nuclear 
fears into the Middle East. The world knows Israel has the bomb, despite lack 
of official confirmation -- certainly since nuclear technician Mordecai Vanunu 
in 1986 gave a British newspaper photographs and a detailed account of the 
secret weapons factory under the Dimona atomic reactor in the Negev desert. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, Israel purchased MD-660 ground-to-ground missiles form 
France, and -- standard practice in Israel -- manufactured home-grown versions. 
The public debut of one carried Israel's first satellite, Ofek, into orbit on 
Sept. 19, 1988. The Israelis had a second, experimental Ofek in orbit from 
April to July this year. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks ago came a further, thinly veiled warning to Iraq, when 
Israel tested its anti-missile missile for the first time. The Arrow 
anti-ballistic system is largely funded by the U.S. Strategic Defense 
Initiative program. 
</P>
<P>
In this current crisis, the Israeli public has been told that millions of gas 
masks are ready for distribution -- but there is no need because Iraq does not 
have chemical warheads and any Iraqi warplane flying toward Israel would be 
shot down. To keep morale high, the army has said that Israel's chemical 
warfare countermeasures are the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis still believe in maintaining a technological edge over their 
enemies. They increasingly put their faith in deterrence, hoping that selective 
leaks about Israel's "non-conventional" arsenal will be enough to deter the 
Iraqis from starting a war. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the CIA and Israel's Mossad, however, emphasize Hussein is 
determined not to surrender to international pressure and still hopes to have 
his own nuclear arms with appropriate means of delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how the current crisis resolves itself, whether through diplomacy 
or battle, Israel feels it is facing a clock ticking against its interests. The 
Israeli people do not want Iraq to have nuclear weapons. No referendum has ever 
been taken, however, as to when or how Israel should use nuclear bombs in the 
name of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The only threat the Israelis can make is the vague, but potent, one: "Iraq will 
not be the same Iraq" if Israel is attacked. Specifically, Defense Minister 
Moshe Arens has threatened massive attacks by the Israeli air force if Iraq 
sends troops westward into Jordan as an implicit move toward Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Science Minister Yuval Neeman went so far as to confirm that Israel could 
respond to Iraq's chemical-weapons threat by responding "with the same 
merchandise." It was a rare mention of Israeli weapons capabilities -- normally 
shrouded in official secrecy and military censorship. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, successive Israeli governments tried to prevent local and 
foreign journalists from publishing stories about the development of 
non-conventional weapons -- and even conventional ones -- by Israeli scientists 
and defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion has lately become freer, although on the biggest taboo the 
government continues to stick to a well-worn slogan: "Israel will not be the 
first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to Western intelligence officials and civilian analysts in the 
United States and Europe, Israel is no more than a few years away from 
developing submarine-launched cruise missiles as a second-strike arsenal. These 
could retaliate even if Arab forces managed to hit Israel's nuclear reactor, 
ground-to-ground missile sites and air force bases. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli strategists still have not worked out exactly when such weapons would 
be used, although analysts believe Israel has an extensive range of nuclear 
arms including small, "battlefield" shells. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, it is impossible to say precisely where the U.S. nuclear 
threshold stands in this unique desert mission. If Iraq uses even one 
mustard-gas or nerve-gas shell against U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, would 
America "nuke" Iraq in revenge? Or only to prevent the GI's in the gulf from 
being overrun by a million Iraqi soldiers? 
</P>
<P>
The strategy is not to have a stated strategy; to keep the adversary guessing. 
Unfortunately, there is guesswork on both sides. U. S. intelligence is armed 
with the best satellite photographs and radar-readings from AWACS 
reconnaissance planes, but still cannot read the mind of a dictator. Only 
Hussein holds the key to how bad the conflict may get.

I find your editorial ("More Offshore Drilling Because of Saddam?" Aug. 19) 
opposing more drilling for oil off California's coast both elitist and morally 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Too many Americans are self-righteously prepared to make war to preserve our 
access to Mideastern oil. Heaven forbid that we should drill for it right here 
in our own neighborhood.

Tom Clancy wrapped up his lengthy comments on the present Persian Gulf crisis 
with this -- "The likelihood of a world-ending conflict is nearly gone. If we 
can next show in the Persian Gulf that petty wars will not be tolerated, the 
dream of all human history -- the elimination of war as an instrument of policy 
-- will become something more practical than a dream" (Commentary, Aug. 20-21). 
In other words, if the American military can just fight one more war in some 
faraway place with a strange sounding name, we will gain the world peace we 
have been searching for. (The impossible dream?) 
</P>
<P>
A long time ago when I was a young soldier, I used to read a lot of military 
history. I often wondered how they could get all those soldiers to go off on 
those long crusades, when, even if they did make it back, they were discarded 
like used sandals -- so the leaders could start off on the next one with fresh 
new ones. For the past 50 years, U.S. warriors have suffered, fought and died 
all over the world -- seeking that illusive dream -- peace. Yet here it is 1990 
and our leaders are telling us, "Just one more war and we will find it." 
</P>
<P>
Are Americans ready again to see naked little girls running and screaming down 
a road, covered with burning napalm? American soldiers lying in grotesque 
shapes after being shot or gassed? Burning tanks with our crews still inside? 
How many evening news programs will they have to watch before they start to 
feel the horrors of war that they so bravely send those young soldiers off to 
fight and die in? 
</P>
<P>
True, most of those soldiers are mostly from working or poor-class families -- 
so it isn't like seeing your own son there, is it? Are you going to try and 
blame them for all this latest carnage when they come home -- like they did the 
Vietnam veterans? The time to start thinking about this is right now. History 
has shown that all those old crusaders accomplished little more than a ripple 
in the history of mankind. And that's all we will accomplish, too. Yesterday's 
heroes -- today's fools.

The Times is correct in calling attention to the oil industry's renewed attempt 
at offshore drilling in environmentally sensitive areas. These areas have 
unproven reserves and where oil is found it is in such small quantities as to 
be negligible in the entire energy picture. 
</P>
<P>
No, drilling off the California coast and areas such as the beautiful, 
biologically productive and very fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge must 
remain off-limits to the environmentally destructive oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
This country must develop a credible energy policy incorporating conservation, 
new energy sources and maximum exploitation of existing supplies. Great strides 
in energy conservation have been made in this nation, but as other nations have 
shown, particularly Japan, we can do much more without compromising our 
comfortable lifestyle. Increasing the fuel efficiency standards is a wise first 
step.

A little leadership from Washington, is that too much to ask?

Few men boasted as impressive a resume upon running for the presidency as 
President Bush. Nevertheless, this consummate politician may have misjudged how 
his playing golf and fishing will be perceived by the American people while 
thousands of our military prepare for conflict in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
President Carter was seen as a virtual prisoner during the hostage taking late 
in his Administration. President Bush, apprehensive of a similar fate as that 
of Presient Carter, overreacted by appearing nonchalantly in front of the media 
on the first tee, determined not to be imprisoned in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
However, by this misplaced conduct the President opened himself to criticism 
from two camps -- either as a dedicated sportsman, to the detriment of his 
constitutional duties, or a politician too concerned with his image and the 
upcoming 1992 election season.

WHEN THE EXAM FAILS STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
FAIRER, BETTER SAT TESTS WOULD BE A BOON FOR HIGHER EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scholastic Aptitude Test, a requirement for the college-bound, may soon get 
a much needed overhaul. College Board trustees are expected to vote next month 
on proposed revisions of the standardized test, which measures general math and 
verbal skills. The revamping, the biggest in 50 years, is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The changes probably won't make the rigorous exam any less difficult, but the 
revisions are bound to include more relevant information and address complaints 
that the test is biased against women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2 million high school juniors and seniors annually take the SAT in 
search of a high score -- 1,600 is perfect -- that will open the door to 
college. The College Board, which administers the test, claims that it is an 
indicator of future academic success. Critics complain the exam is biased in 
content and form. On that point, a federal judge ruled last year that New York 
state discriminated against women when it used SAT scores to award 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Girls tend to score lower than boys on the SAT, although young women tend to 
get better grades in high school and college. Educators who believe the test 
under-predicts female achievement specifically criticize the multiple-choice 
format and the content of some questions. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple-choice tests hint at answers, encourage guessing and reward quick 
decisions. They also lend themselves to expensive test-coaching courses that 
emphasize speed and test-taking tricks. The new SAT would include some math 
questions without multiple-choice answers. That skills-oriented approach might 
more accurately measure math ability. The exam would test vocabulary by having 
students read passages of writing. That could also provide a better measure of 
critical thinking and classroom abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The new test may also feature an essay question as a measure of writing 
proficiency. College administrators applaud that proposal, but some Asian and 
Latino educators believe the requirement would penalize students for whom 
English is a second language. To ward off further complaints about ethnic bias, 
the Educational Testing Service will need to proceed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
The College Board denies any bias, but the examiners cannot deny the gap in 
scores between white males, and black and Latino students. The revision process 
will provide an opportunity to address that concern. 
</P>
<P>
Excelling on the SAT can make a profound difference in a young person's future. 
Every student deserves a fair shot at success.

<P>
Ever since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent the price of oil skyrocketing, 
American newspapers have been full of estimates of the impact on our rate of 
inflation and on the pace of economic growth during the coming year. But the 
jump in oil prices also creates a new pool of "petrodollars." How big will that 
pool of wealth transferred to oil-producing countries be? And what effect will 
it have on the world economy? 
</P>
<P>
Even with conservative assumptions, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries could easily end up with more than $125 billion of new income over 
the next year. The price of oil is now about $15 a barrel higher than it was 
before its recent jump. Since the OPEC countries are now selling about 55 
million barrels of oil a day, that hike adds a good $700 million a day to their 
coffers, even after allowing for reductions in consumption. 
</P>
<P>
If the oil price remains at its current level for the next 12 months, the $700 
million a day would add up to about $250 billion. Most oil experts expect that 
if the political stand-off does not worsen, the price will drop back over the 
coming months to an estimated $25 a barrel, about $7 higher than its 
pre-invasion level. At that price, the increased OPEC revenue would be $125 
billion over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad will not share in the extra revenue if the Iraq-Kuwait embargo is 
effective. Instead, the extra revenue will go to countries like Saudi Arabia, 
Venezuela, Mexico and the small sheikdoms of the Arabian peninsula. Most of 
these countries have nationalized oil industries, so the extra income will go 
directly to the governments. 
</P>
<P>
What will they do with this windfall? In the long run they may spend it on 
increased imports as they seek to improve their countries' infrastructure and 
raise their people's standards of living. But it takes time to develop plans 
for major infrastructure projects and other investments. And uncertainty about 
how long high oil prices will persist will probably discourage increases in 
consumer purchases for some months. So the most likely outcome is that for at 
least a year almost all of the extra revenue is likely to be saved. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, when the OPEC countries had a similar windfall, they lent most of 
their petrodollars to banks in the United States, Japan and Western Europe. In 
turn, these banks loaned the funds to developing countries in Latin America, 
Asia and Africa. This process of recycling petrodollars got the banks in 
trouble in the early 1980s when the debtor countries discovered that they had 
taken on more debt than they could afford. It's a safe bet that the banks will 
not want to go down that road again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the banks will be looking for safer, traditional borrowers. More 
than in the 1970s, a large part of the new petrodollars will be invested 
directly in government bonds and corporate stocks and bonds. Whether invested 
directly or through the banks, the magnitude of the increased in petrodollars 
is large enough to have a substantial impact on the capital market and world 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks ago, financial market analysts were worried about the 
increased demand for funds to finance investments in infrastructure and new 
plant and equipment in Eastern Europe. The result of this was a rise in 
interest rates worldwide. But now the jump in OPEC savings during the coming 
year will almost certainly exceed the total capital flow to Eastern Europe. By 
improving the balance between supply and demand for savings in the world 
capital market, the increased supply of petrodollars should therefore reverse 
the previous rise in real interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust settles, real interest rates should be lower than they were 
before the Iraqi invasion and probably lower than they were before last 
winter's events in Eastern Europe. The reduction in real interest rates will be 
dampened but not canceled by other effects of the rise in oil prices. Higher 
oil prices will cause some households to reduce savings to pay for more 
expensive heating oil and gasoline. Governments may save less or borrow more 
because of the slowdown in economic activity caused by the rise in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, what has actually happened since the Iraqi invasion is that 
interest rates have increased world wide because of fears that the oil price 
rise will initiate a new round of inflation similar to the experience of the 
1970s. We're optimistic that a renewal of inflation is unlikely unless the 
international political situation explodes, since the rise in oil prices is 
relatively much smaller this time than it was in 1973 or 1979. But even more 
important, we believe that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will not 
repeat their mistake of the 1970s. If they stick to a policy of keeping total 
spending growing just as it would have before the rise in oil prices, the 
increase in the price level will be temporary and there will be no rise in the 
future rate of inflation.

By EVE PONTIUS is a Playa del Rey teacher and mother of three whose children 
will be on three different schedules in the fall of 1991. She spoke about the 
year-round program. She told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the big problems is making sure that all kids will be on the same track 
(schedule). There's very little guarantee along that line. 
</P>
<P>
It's supposed to be based on zip codes, so if the whole family is in one 
zip-code area, all the kids would be on that same track. There are several 
different tracks that would be going at the same time. Some kids would be off 
three weeks in February, some would be off three weeks in March, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Something else that parents had talked about was community support. Right now, 
most of the community activities are set up so that they work during the 
12-week summer break. And they wanted community support before they went into 
this year-round schooling. If you were two working parents, you couldn't be 
taking off to watch your kids for three weeks. And they wanted to make sure 
that the Parks and Recreation Department would offer classes year-round. So 
it's probably going to increase the need for employment in the department.

HELP THE SOVIETS PUMP THE OIL WE NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED WARNER NEAL, Fred Warner Neal is professor of international relations 
and government at the Claremont Graduate School and executive vice president of 
the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new status of American-Soviet relations offers the United States a way out 
of our over-dependence on Middle East oil as well as a means of helping the 
Soviet Union out of its economic chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil exporter. Production from existing 
fields could be substantially increased if Western drilling and refining 
techniques were made available. In addition, while "proven" Soviet oil reserves 
are not as great as those in the Middle East, some geological experts believe 
that far greater reserves will yet be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has shown a reluctance to join Germany and other 
Western European countries in helping the Soviet Union out of its grave 
economic crisis. But if aid to Moscow were presented as a way of making us less 
dependent on Middle East oil, it would likely be accepted both in Congress and 
the nation. Actually, the aid would be minimal -- primarily loans for purchase 
of drilling and refining equipment as a part of arrangements guaranteeing sales 
of oil to the United States. Some Western oil companies are interested, though 
they are understandably cautious about involving themselves in a country whose 
future appears so uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
A deal would be eagerly welcomed in Moscow. Soviet oil production actually 
decreased by 8% in the last two years, due largely to inadequate drilling 
machinery and absence of Western oil technology. At the same time, the Soviet 
Union has more oil available for export than previously because the Soviets 
insist on being paid in hard currency, and their traditional customers in 
Eastern European don't have it. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets must find hard-currency customers like the United States. For lack 
of hard currency, the Soviet government has warned it may not be able to import 
enough grain to feed its people. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating our oil dependence on the Middle East would put us in an enormously 
better position economically, and, given the current crisis, would ease 
pressure to take military action that could have disastrous consequences. In 
short, a deal for Soviet oil is a natural.

NEGOTIATION IS THE PATH OF COURAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH'S HARD STANCE MAY TAKE A STAGGERING, UNNECESSARY TOLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judged by his public actions -- and there has been not the slightest intimation 
of any differing private diplomacy -- President Bush has launched his country 
on a path of folly and peril. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to see why he rushed with such eagerness into this vast deployment 
of national resources. Aside from the gulf crisis itself, the savings and loan 
scandal was exploding, with First Son Neil Bush a conspicuous part of the 
political fallout. The economy was sliding into recession, with 10 years' worth 
of fiscal imprudence waiting to be exploited by the Democrats. Bush's own 
standing in the polls was beginning to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
So the President leaped ahead of the entirely proper and well-handled move to 
establish U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein's seizure of Kuwait, and 
hijacked the crisis. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was sent speeding to 
Saudi Arabia. He flourished satellite photographs at King Fahd, showing Iraqi 
tanks rolling toward the Saudi border. But a Pentagon source familiar with 
Cheney's materials says the satellite photos vouchsafed the king were slightly 
out of date. Photographs of more recent vintage revealed that the Iraqi tanks 
had stopped short of the border and were digging in. There was no indication 
that Hussein was embarked on an attack on Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, however, Bush seemed to be studying no history but the wartime 
speeches of Churchill and Eisenhower. Twice the number of Marines that landed 
at Inchon have been dispatched to the region, and staggering loads of supplies 
freighted eastward. 
</P>
<P>
What has been the consequence thus far? It is not clear how much damage has 
been done to Iraq, but the economies of the advanced industrial nations are 
reeling. The West is essentially blockading itself; the soaring price of oil 
and threat of war are dragging fragile economies down. 
</P>
<P>
An attack by the United States on Iraqi-occupied Kuwait would turn disaster 
into catastrophe. Refugee Kuwaitis say that Iraqi military engineers have wired 
dozens of public buildings with explosives. What was not destroyed by U.S. 
bombs and artillery would be reduced to rubble by the Iraqis themselves. In 
order to "save" cheap energy, Bush would have smashed any prospect of stable 
oil prices for a long time to come. The world could slump into long-term 
economic depression. This is aside from the human toll. Iraq is not Grenada or 
Panama. Already U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia are suffering from heat 
prostration. The fine Saudi sand is ruinous to machinery. U.S. carriers dare 
not venture into the exposed upper gulf. There are the makings of a prolonged 
and bloody military engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the very obvious consequences of the present U.S. stance, whose aim, 
as journalists of Bush's entourage are stressing, is to deal Hussein a punitive 
and hopefully fatal blow. Any thought of engaging diplomatically with Hussein 
is shoved aside. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's strategy is not only profoundly foolish but entirely unnecessary. It has 
been clear for nearly two weeks that Saddam Hussein is well aware of his 
miscalculation in grabbing Kuwait and would like a face-saving means of 
retreat. His own negotiating proposal is that an Iraqi pull-out from Kuwait be 
linked to other territorial and political conflicts in the Middle East. He was 
referring to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the annexation 
of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, as well as to Syria's occupation of 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Secretary of State James A. Baker III seems to have disappeared 
from view, it cannot be beyond the wit of U.S. diplomacy to demand of Hussein 
that he immediately withdraw his forces from Kuwait, appending to this demand 
some generalized language about the possibility of future free elections in 
Kuwait and a conference on longstanding points at issue in the region. Hussein 
would jump at the chance to get out of the hole he has landed himself in. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious who is alarmed by the prospect of any such conference. At least 
since 1973, Israel and its supporters in the United States have campaigned 
against such a conclave. Men such as Henry Kissinger, William Safire and A.M. 
Rosenthal -- all particularly identified with Israel's interests -- are today 
rabid in their calls for swift military action against Iraq. As a 
counterweight, conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan have flatly denounced 
Bush's strategy as folly. Aside from Zbigniev Brzezinski's sensible calls for 
prudence, the old Cold-War liberals have been foursquare for war. A Tonkin Gulf 
incident is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
In these tense days, a courageous course is not to tub-thump for war but to 
negotiate a settlement and watch the Iraqi tanks roll peaceably back to 
Baghdad.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival 1990 grew out of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and its 
1987 successor, a not-for-profit event requiring three years of planning and 
the joint efforts of artists, communities and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 participants from 21 countries are scheduled in 230 events at 
70 venues throughout Southern California, including 800 artists from the L.A. 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Festival '90 is unlike either of its two predecessors: It focuses 
on art and cultures that rim the Pacific: Asia, Latin America and Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
This Issue

<P>
Film, stage, music, dance, family attractions and visual arts are spotlighted

The Open Festival, an adjunct to the curated festival, offers even more variety 
than its predominantly international counterpart, with 600 events at 400 sites 
by 740 artists.

PRAYERS, A BLESSING AND AN EXCHANGE OF SONG AND DANCE AT THE KOREAN PEACE BELL 
IN ANGEL'S GATE WILL OPEN THE LONG-AWAITED EVENT SATURDAY

The term opening ceremonies will take on an especially literal meaning Saturday 
when Los Angeles Festival gets under way with spiritual prayers and blessings, 
incense burning and a "gift exchange" of song and dance between various Native 
American, Pacific Island, West African and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We really want it to be a ceremony," said Judy Mitoma, the event's co-curator. 
"An opening like this -- when you have so many cultures and traditions involved 
-- it's not something you program, it's something that really must come from 
the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma continued: "These ceremonies have to do with our need to not only get 
permission, but also the importance of getting information from the 
powers-that-be in the world view -- to get their assistance, help and blessing. 
This 'mark of beginning' will make sure our festival is done with real care." 
</P>
<P>
The event begins at 10 a.m. at the Korean Peace Bell at San Pedro's Point 
Fermin/Angel's Gate Park, where Native American spiritual leaders and artists 
will gather in full traditional dress with members of 17 visiting performing 
groups for whom worship or ceremony is a traditional part of their art. The 
Korean Peace Bell -- which stands on the former home of Fort MacArthur and was 
given to the city of Los Angeles by the Korean government in honor of the 1976 
Bicentennial -- was selected as the site, Mitoma said, because it overlooks the 
Pacific Ocean, which she called the unifying factor for the entire festival. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Apodaca, a Navajo Indian who is director of Santa Ana's Bowers Museum, 
will act as host at the formal ceremony. Along with Native American performers 
from California's Gabrielino, Chumash, Cahuilla Bird Singers and Juaneno 
groups, Apodaca will welcome visitors. An opening prayer will be given by one 
of the Native American spiritual leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Groups will then take part in a gift exchange in the form of presenting a song, 
dance or prayer to the others, after which each will contribute to a ceremonial 
incense burner. Then, after the ringing of the peace bell, the groups will form 
a procession down the hill to a series of waiting stages. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, the estimated 45-minute procession will be completed 
about 12:45 p.m., followed by a series of speeches by officials and dignitaries 
and 6 hours of performances on seven festival stages throughout the park. *

The "outsider" viewpoints of people who don't feel at home within a dominant 
culture are at the heart of the visual arts component of the Los Angeles 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these artists are looking at each other's Pacific Rim cultures with a 
coolly dissecting eye, allowing Eastern and Western ideas and images to invade 
one another and raise more questions than they answer. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists are in some sense strangers to their own societies -- because of 
cultural roots, sexual orientation or a rejection of the consumer-oriented 
practices of the contemporary art world.

At the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach (Friday through Dec. 2), 
Chinese artist Wenda Gu will create a site-specificinstallation, "Red, Black, 
White, Desert." The work will involve the juxtaposition of raincoats made of 
woven palm bark -- the type worn by rural Chinese workers -- with minimalist 
abstract canvases painted in alternating fields of red, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this work lies an idiosyncratic way of viewing the world that, for all 
its brash contemporaneity, stems from the tradition of the great 
"individualist" artists of the Yuan and early Ch'ing Dynasties -- maverick 
artists like Hung-jen and Chu Ta, who retired from the world during tumultuous 
periods of Chinese history and cultivated eccentric signature styles. The 
difference is that Gu remains very much a part of the world, making art that is 
political by implication, if not in overt ways. 
</P>
<P>
Gu, who now lives in New York, was born in Shanghai in 1955. As a child of the 
Cultural Revolution, he painted propaganda posters before attending the School 
of Arts and Crafts in his native city and studying the traditional arts of 
(wooden) seal carving and landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
An obsessive reader and philosophizer, in the tradition of the literati 
painters of Chinese history, Gu became interested in the writings of such 
vastly disparate Western philosophers as Friedrich Nietzsche and Ludwig 
Wittgenstein and the works of such modern Western artists as Marcel Duchamp, 
Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys. 
</P>
<P>
He began to see his work as a way of stirring up the caldron of past and 
present -- of combining slogans he saw on the street with ancient poems and 
making mutant seals in which the calligraphy was fractured and rearranged. 
Slamming together bits and pieces of diverse eras, lifestyles and cultures in 
his installations, he finds conflict more fruitful than the aura of tranquility 
generally associated with Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
Delighting in paradoxes and riddles, he is a black humorist with a strong 
mystic streak. Describing a 1987 performance piece of his involving bloody 
gloves, red tubes and a small house structure made of mixed media paintings, Gu 
wrote, "The atmosphere was very sexual and painful. Only my desire was 
present."

At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Traversals: Instructions to the Double" 
(today through Sept. 30) is a program of nine videotapes assembled by guest 
curator Peter Callas. The works in the show are all by Pacific Rim artists who 
have visited other cultures and responded not with travelogues but with 
open-ended, highly subjective meditations. Unconventional editing and 
post-production work emphasizes the rhythms and layers of imagery the artists 
perceived in their travels. 
</P>
<P>
In Edin Velez's "Meaning of the Interval" (18 minutes, 1987), the subject is 
empty space. Known as ma in Japan, prolonged intervals -- of space or time -- 
are considered a source of harmonic energy. They exist everywhere: in 
buildings, paintings, even on the slow-moving Noh theater stage. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico-born Velez (who now lives in New York) looks at the large and small 
manifestations of ma in Japan: from the distance between one subway station and 
another to a stark white line that divides in half -- revealed as the space 
between the two pillars of a Shinto temple gateway. Using post-production 
wizardry to alter the sizes and positions of his imagery, Velez also emphasizes 
peculiar juxtapositions of conservative and outre behavior in modern-day Japan. 
These are the "spaces" that separate different pockets of life in a 
hierarchical and superficially orderly society. 
</P>
<P>
Naoko Kurotsuka's "The Palm" (5 minutes, 1985) was shot at a long-abandoned 
temple arch in the ruins of Ayuttheya in Thailand -- a site at once familiar to 
a Japanese (because of the countries' shared Buddhist culture) and undeniably 
foreign. Static shots focus on details of the natural world that continues to 
flourish despite the lack of human presence. To begin and end each shot, the 
Japanese artist cupped her hands over the lens, as if helping each image to be 
born and to die. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westerners consider ancient, unchanging landscape as the essence of 
timelessness, Kurotsuka writes, in the East, timelessness is equivalent to "the 
ever-changing state of temporary nature." 
</P>
<P>
Other video artists represented in the show are Geoffrey Weary, Robert Cahen, 
Ko Nakajima, Tony Conrad, Steina Vasulka, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and Callas. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Photography Center, "Golden Pool" (Sept. 4 through Oct. 14) 
brings together the photographic work of 12 artists -- some established, some 
emerging -- who live in Southern California and explore different aspects of 
Asian and Asian-American cultural experience. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Lee blows up stills from Chinese movies of the '20s, '30s and '40s to 
"big screen" size and adds statements reflecting her ironic take on the 
contemporary status of Chinese-American women. Carol Nye's black-and-white 
photographs investigate the ways minority groups in China adapt to the dominant 
culture. Other artists in the exhibit include May Sun, Patrick Nagatani and 
Alan Cheung.

"Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" at the Wight Art Gallery, 
UCLA (Sept. 9 through Dec. 9) is a huge show, the largest ever assembled 
specifically on the art of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. (as distinct from 
Latino, Hispanic or Latin American art). This emphasis is on the relationship 
of the art to el movimiento, the Chicano civil rights movement of the '60s and 
'70s, which focused on demands for workers' rights, bilingual education, the 
abolition of racist cultural barriers, and the return of land to the 
descendants of original land-grant holders. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 130 paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures are the work of 
90 artists from across the U.S., chosen by a national advisory committee. It 
remains to be seen whether the show -- which unfortunately does not include 
performance or installation art -- will make a compelling case for individually 
distinctive voices of members of a minority group, or sink under the weight of 
curatorship-by-committee.

David Wojnarowicz's "Tongues of Flame," at the Santa Monica Museum of Art 
(through Sept. 5) is an exhibit of the artist's passionate and motley pieces 
from the past decade, which all deal in some way with his life as a gay man. 
Wojnarowicz -- who suffers from complications of AIDS and who endured a 
shockingly brutal and loveless youth -- works from the position of radical 
social outcast. By turns darkly fantastic and coldly nihilistic, his imagery of 
death, decay, violence, male sexuality and technological malfunction is 
virtually guaranteed to raise bourgeois hackles.

Robbie Conal's brand of guerrilla warfare is a kinder, gentler phenomenon, 
notable mostly for the dogged persistance with which he plasters thousands of 
his political posters throughout the U.S. Organized by the Pasadena Art 
Alliance, "Unauthorized History: Robbie Conal's Portraits of Power" at the 
Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena (Sept. 8 through Nov. 9), includes his 
deliberately unflattering images of such Reagan-Bush era figures as Jim and 
Tammy Bakker, John Poindexter, Jesse Helms and Ronald, Nancy and George.

CONTROVERSIAL MURALS OVERCOME CENSORSHIP TO DEPICT L.A. HISTORY AND CHICANO

Some murals that bedeck the scene as Los Angeles Festival opens are going to 
give streetside L.A. not only a new look, but also a challenging one. Two of 
them, for that matter, are not new. Although Willie Herron's faded "Doliente de 
Hidalgo," completed in 1976, was rescued by the Social and Public Art Resource 
Center (SPARC) as part of its 1989-1990 Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls 
Unlimited Program, Barbara Carrasco's "History of Los Angeles -- A Mexican 
Perspective," first undertaken in 1981, is being reclaimed after being 
concealed from the public eye on other, and controversial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the issues concerning censorship that have made headlines for more 
than a year, and considering Los Angeles' own history on censorship, such 
action is a switch. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship here peaked during the McCarthy era when city fathers were bent on 
finding hammers and sickles in the most benign abstract or semi-abstract 
paintings. In the case of public art, officialdom remained vigilant even into 
the '80s as the Carrasco work testifies, in order to decide for citizens what 
was and what wasn't suitable view. 
</P>
<P>
It had been hoped that along with the Carrasco work, whose completion and 
installation is sponsored by the festival, that the restoration of David Alfaro 
Siqueiros' "America Tropical," which had been under way, would be completed in 
time for the festival. As The Times reported earlier this month, completion 
will not take place until 1991. Painted on a second-story wall on Olvera Street 
in 1932 and hidden under coats of whitewash since shortly afterwards, it was a 
prime target of official decree. 
</P>
<P>
"America Tropical" reflected Siquieros' outrage against the exploitation of 
migrant workers in the United States, and their mass deportation to Mexico, but 
the depiction of a crucified Mexican Indian placed below a predatory American 
Eagle outraged civic leaders, promoting them to take immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
After an earlier attempt to restore the mural was abandoned in the 1970s, 
"America Tropical" has been undergoing conservation work on the wall of the 
Olvera Street building where it was installed. The 16-by-80-foot artwork may 
still be obscured by scaffolding when the festival opens but should become 
visible shortly afterwards, according to program director Claire Peeps. 
</P>
<P>
The whitewashing of the Siquieros work is recorded on the Carrasco mural, whose 
completion was blocked less than a decade ago. Now, the Chicana artist's work, 
which has precisely the same dimensions (16 x 80 feet) as the Siqueiros -- 
coincidence, Carrasco says -- will go on view at Union Station, to beam down 
from a wall in the main waiting room, only a stone's throw from the Siqueiros. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Community Redevelopment Agency following approval of the 
artist's sketch in 1981, the mural was rejected by the CRA a year later on the 
grounds of its subject matter, especially for scenes depicting Chinese railroad 
workers who were executed in the late 19th Century and the internment of 
Japanese-Americans during the World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After a court battle over ownership of its copyright, which the artist 
ultimately won, the controversy did not prevent exhibition of a large section 
of the unfinished, but luckily, portable, work at MIT in 1987. Critical praise 
ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Carrasco's mural has 51 panels, each framed in strands of hair flowing from the 
head of a dreamy Queen of the Angels at the far left. Reading chronologically 
from left to right, they portray historical events, landmarks and figures that 
are not just meaningful to Chicanos but point to the contribution of the many 
cultures that have played a role in making Los Angeles the city it is today. 
</P>
<P>
They range from the building of the San Gabriel Mission to a contemporary 
freeway scene; from the depictions of an unidentified Gabrielino Indian and the 
first black mayor of Los Angeles, to murdered Times reporter Ruben Salazar, 
"Zoot Suit" playwright Luis Valdez and its star Edward James Olmos, and the 
Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela. Carrasco's 17 young assistants, most of them gang 
members, along with others involved in the project, are there too. 
</P>
<P>
Born in El Paso in 1955 and raised in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project, 
Carrasco has won global recognition. A UCLA graduate and currently a Master of 
Fine Arts candidate at CalArts, she collaborated on the "Zoot Suit Mural" at 
the Aquarius Theatre in 1979, and on murals in Armenia and Nicaragua, and in 
addition, has created banners and other artworks for the United Farm Workers. 
Another controversial work, "Pesticides," was shown last year on a spectacolor 
lightboard in New York's Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh, vibrant hues that emblazoned Willie Herron's "Doliente de Hidalgo" 
in East Los Angeles when it was first completed will again beam down from the 
Mercado (then Farmacia) Hidalgo at 4301 City Terrace Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Herron's mural, 15 x 150 feet, wraps around the building's facade like a shaped 
canvas, facing south, southwest and west, centered with a large-scale depiction 
of the crowned Virgin Mary, and Father Miguel Hidalgo holding a flaming torch 
in his right hand, his left raised in defiant gesture, to recall the movement 
he organized to protest Spanish rule. 
</P>
<P>
The work also portrays indigenous Mexicans of the last century, a contemporary 
family of three and futurist Latinos traveling through space. 
</P>
<P>
According to the artist, the mural symbolically attempts to address the 
increase in Latin American contributions to the present and future that is 
shaping and redefining Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Herron, who has also participated in Chicano music and performance 
organizations, has exhibited internationally, and, as one-half the design team 
of Herron-Roberts, is a graphic artist for the Chicano Art Resistance and 
Affirmation (CARA) exhibition at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Doliente de Hidalgo," for which Herron was assisted by Ralph and Rene Ramirez, 
is one of 15 murals sponsored by SPARC's Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls 
Unlimited program, bringing the total to date to 24. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by muralist Judith Baca, and housed in the old Venice Police Station, 
SPARC is a nonprofit, multicultural, community-based arts organization 
dedicated to producing, exhibiting and preserving public murals of Los Angeles. 
Now in its third year, the city's Great Wall program commissions artists and 
pairs them with youths from the neighborhoods in which their murals will be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Bus tours of Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls Unlimited are set Saturday and 
Sept. 16 (half-day), or you can view them as part of a rear-projection slide 
presentation of a national selection of Chicano murals on a large-scale screen 
during the exhibition, "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985," at 
the Wight Art Gallery, UCLA, Sept. 9-Dec. 9

A ninth soldier was arrested in connection with the slaying of six Jesuit 
priests and two others after he fled from a courtroom last Friday during 
questioning, military sources said. The order to arrest Sgt. Oscar Armando 
Solorzano came after he "was caught giving false testimony and contradicted 
himself several times" while testifying as a witness in the controversial case, 
a court spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Solorzano is a member of the commando unit of the elite U.S.-trained Atlacatl 
battalion that was countering a rebel offensive in the capital last Nov. 16, 
the night in which the priests, their housekeeper and her teen-age daughter 
were killed. Solorzano was accused of being present at the site of the slayings 
in declarations by several of the eight soldiers being held on murder charges 
in connection with the controversial case.

President Fernando Collor de Mello's draconian anti-inflation plan, implemented 
last March, has set off Brazil's worst recession in 10 years, according to data 
from the IBGE, the government statistics institute. Since Collor froze a third 
of the nation's wealth, ended indexation of wages to prices and slashed 
government spending, Brazil's gross domestic product fell 8.8%, compared to the 
same period a year ago, the IBGE said in data released in Rio de Janeiro. The 
freeze on liquidity, the data showed, meant a sharp fall in orders which sent 
production crashing 16.87% between April and June, compared with the same 
period last year.

<P>
EAST L.A.: PARADE THROUGH THE STREETS COMMEMORATES THE ANTI-VIETNAM WAR RALLY 
THAT ENDED IN THE DEATHS OF RUBEN SALAZAR AND TWO OTHERS. 
</P>

<P>
An estimated 5,000 people, many of whom were not born 20 years ago, marched 
peacefully through East Los Angeles on Saturday to mark the violent 
anti-Vietnam War protest on the same streets that ended in the death of newsman 
Ruben Salazar and two others in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 3 1/2-mile march on Atlantic and Whittier boulevards was staged to 
bring public attention to the same issues that prompted the original protest 
rally -- U.S. foreign policy and Latinos' low status in this country -- 
Saturday's commemoration had a modern beat to it. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers from throughout the Southwest in outfits ranging from "Save Yosemite" 
T-shirts to brightly colored aerobics outfits with expensive sneakers shouted 
and chatted under mostly cloudy skies that gave way to sunshine by early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters were college students who said they knew of Salazar's 
death and the 1970 protest, considered by many to be the largest political 
gathering of people of Mexican descent in this country, only from textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because Ruben was murdered by the officers," said Margaret Alarcon of 
East Los Angeles College as she and a friend, Gina Aparicio, carried a 
10-foot-high portrait of the slain newsman. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, a Times columnist and news director of Los Angeles television station 
KMEX, was killed on Aug. 29, 1970, as violence erupted at the end of the march 
at what was then called Laguna Park. He was sitting in a Whittier Boulevard bar 
when a tear-gas projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy struck his head, killing 
him instantly. The park was later named after the newsman. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar's death was ruled accidental, but the county paid $700,000 to his widow 
and three children. 
</P>
<P>
To honor the reporter, a troupe of actors Saturday repeatedly re-enacted the 
tragic events at the bar as marchers went by. Most of the participants slowed 
to watch the reenactment of the deputy firing the fatal shot into the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"Viva Salazar!" was the marchers' frequent response to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The exuberance of the young marchers seemed to catch many of the longtime 
Chicano activists by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
With shouts of "Chicano Power" still ringing in his ears after two hours of 
marching, Richard Martinez, Los Angeles director of the Texas-based Southwest 
Voter Registration Education Project, was heard to remark: 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard more 'Chicano Power' shouts in the last half hour than I have in 
the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
And if U.S. involvement in Vietnam rankled the National Chicano Moratorium 
Committee, organizer of the 1970 protest, this march, also staged by the group, 
gave some participants a chance to criticize the presence of U.S. troops in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"(President) Bush is making the same mistake all over again," said Denise 
Ayala, 18, of Rowland Heights. "Iraq is just another way of saying, 'Vietnam.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
A plethora of causes were espoused by the marchers, many of whom carried 
Mexican flags. 
</P>
<P>
Placards favoring a Palestinian homeland and political reform in Mexico were 
mixed with those favoring a sensitive restoration of Olvera Street, a boycott 
of Tianguis markets and women's rights to legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers also called for better educational and job opportunities and for 
more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
One placard near the start of the procession seemed to capture the heightened 
ethnic awareness among the college-age marchers. It read: "Yo soy Chicano, not 
Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
One set of observers clearly overjoyed by the march's festive and peaceful 
nature was the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to avoid a repeat of the violence that prompted 60 injuries and 200 
arrests in 1970, deputies kept a low profile as marchers snaked through the 
streets. No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of cooperation for this march has been fantastic," said Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Fidel Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
Some marchers expressed fears about a recurrence of violence, which proved to 
be unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a bad leg, Rodolfo Acuna, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State 
Northridge, marched so he could keep an eye on his wife, Lupe, and daughter, 
Angela, 5, who were ahead of him in the procession. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go crazy if something happened to them and I wasn't here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, some grumblings from Whittier Boulevard merchants and some 
area residents about the march. Some merchants closed their doors while the 
marchers went by. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they proving?" asked a merchant, who declined to identify himself. 
"All they're doing is bringing back bad memories and the death of Salazar." 
</P>
<P>
Groused another merchant, who said Saturday was the busiest day for his store: 
"They should have done this on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Near the New Silver Dollar bar, where Salazar was killed, resident Rachel 
Reyes, who was critical of many of the marchers' opinions, unfurled a black 
U.S. Navy Seals banner. She said her son, Timothy, recently was sent to the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the banner that these people ought to be honoring," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
After the march ended, several speakers urged the crowd at Salazar Park to push 
for improved educational, social and political rights for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to march together and stand up," said Nita Gonzales, daughter of 
longtime Chicano activist Rodolfo (Corky) Gonzales of Denver. "Black, brown and 
red. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to add our voices to Chicanos of 20 years ago. We have to let this 
country know that we will not remain silent. We cannot remain silent." 
</P>

Times staff writer George Ramos also contributed to this story.

AN ALLERGY TO 'EVERYTHING' STIRS CRUSADE

VOORHEES, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of searching, Mary Lamielle figured out what was making her so 
miserably, dramatically sick. It was the world. 
</P>
<P>
Lamielle, who lives in Voorhees, is chemically sensitive, a condition that is 
not recognized by the medical Establishment or the insurance industry but that 
sufferers say can be debilitating. 
</P>
<P>
She founded and leads the National Center for Environmental Health Strategies, 
a 2,000-member organization working to win recognition and help for victims. 
For herself, she struggles with an isolation forced by the nausea, vertigo and 
breathing difficulties she said will occur if she subjects herself to perfume, 
gasoline vapors, even her new car. 
</P>
<P>
Her crusade began six years ago, with the belief that her worsening illness had 
something to do with malfunctions at the nearby sewage treatment plant, exhaust 
from idling diesel trucks at the local chicken processing plant and other 
things around her. 
</P>
<P>
"The property around us was just unbearable," Lamielle said. "So my own 
involvement became a way of self-protection." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband has presented her testimony in Washington -- illness keeps her from 
doing it -- while she struggled with the neighbors' pesticides and the plastics 
that prevent her from riding in the family's new car. 
</P>
<P>
Lamielle, 38, remembers having a heightened sensitivity to chemicals even as a 
girl. Exposure to formaldehyde during a frog dissection exercise caused burning 
in her lungs and her first sinus infection. 
</P>
<P>
Sinus problems and migraine headaches became more frequent, and normal life 
increasingly difficult. She was forced, in 1980, to leave her job as a contract 
specialist with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Even a residue of certain perfumes "makes me feel disoriented during the time, 
but an hour later makes me start retching," she said. "That goes on for hours 
afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
If she gets too close to the neighbors' lawn, she can't see properly, she 
trembles and her heart beats irregularly. Visitors have to be careful not to 
style their hair with mousse or wear clothes fresh from the dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Worry about the formaldehyde in new furniture has prevented her and her husband 
from replacing the worn-out couch. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she wears an oxygen mask -- ceramic because of the chemicals in 
plastic ones. About once a year, she ventures into a department store. 
</P>
<P>
The tools of an activist's home office are out of the question. Lamielle writes 
on a manual typewriter rather than a computer, and she arranges with a nearby 
print shop to send her materials out. 
</P>
<P>
Though insurers and doctors often dismiss chemical sensitivity as 
psychosomatic, Lamielle said she is encouraged by a gradual acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"The tables have switched," she said. "Today there is a consciousness that 
indeed you can get sick from lawn-care chemicals, from carpeting being 
installed."

TWO JUVENILES HELD IN KNIFE DEATH OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two juveniles were being held on suspicion of murder Saturday after police 
discovered the registered owner of a car they were driving stabbed to death at 
her Eagle Rock home. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Ron Whitt said that police apprehended the two 
suspected gang members, ages 14 and 15, after they ran a stop sign in a Nissan 
280Z about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The car's registration indicated that it belonged to Doniece Taylor, 48, Whitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found Taylor on a couch at her home stabbed to death with a butcher 
knife from her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The pair are being held without bail at Eastlake Juvenile Hall, he said.

CAR HITS TRUCK, JUMPS CURB; 1 KILLED, 5 HURT

<P>
One transient was killed and five others injured outside a downtown Los Angeles 
homeless mission Saturday when they were struck by a hit-and-run driver whose 
car collided with a tomato truck and then careened onto the sidewalk, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at about 8:30 a.m. while the transients were either 
sleeping or sitting outside the Fred Jordan Mission at 445 Towne Ave., said 
Sgt. Jeff Siggers of the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Traffic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Siggers said the male driver of a white 1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo tried to 
squeeze past the big-rig truck, which was making a right turn from Towne Avenue 
to 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The car bounced off the truck and jumped the curb, striking the transients as 
they sat on the 5th Street side of the Skid Row shelter, Siggers said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Myers, a shelter worker, said he saw the collision, and ran to the 
corner just after the car struck the transients. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have time to do nothing," Myers said. "They were just screaming, 
just screaming. They were just laying there, in shock." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached the car, Myers said, the driver had fled, along with an 
unknown number of passengers. Police recovered the car at the scene, and said 
there were as many as four people in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom Hatter of Central Traffic Division said detectives are investigating 
the case to determine who was at fault. He said the car's driver faces possible 
manslaughter and felony hit-and-run charges. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the three male and two female victims were not released. One man 
was pronounced dead at County-USC Medical Center at about noon, Siggers said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other victims were seriously injured, one with a crushed pelvis and 
the other with a broken leg.

RICHARD EDER: THE LONG AND BROKEN ROAD OF AN IRISH POET; 
</P>
<P>
SELECTED POEMS, 1966-1967 BY SEAMUS HEANEY (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $20; 
260 PP.) 
</P>

<P>
After a while, a poet moves on or risks becoming Poet Laureate of himself. The 
moving-on is tough. It is not, like the pioneer's, necessarily to greener or 
more promising land. Departure may be from the poet's best work. 
</P>
<P>
A midway selection of poems -- in this case covering Seamus Heaney's first two 
writing decades -- is first of all the history of a journey, and of the 
discoveries and inventions made along the way. Heaney's are remarkable enough; 
and some are so remarkable that, like automated bank tellers and pizza, it is 
hard to believe they ever were not there. 
</P>
<P>
But such a selection also asks where the journey will go on to. Heaney is 50, 
and a couple more decades surely are to be had out of him. It is easy to 
pronounce a ritual salutation to the effect that with so much done, there is a 
lot to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
There is; but it's not that simple. It's like saying to a hunter: I look 
forward to your next 20 years of tigers. Heaney's "Selected Poems 1966-1987" is 
a record of triumph, but the risks show themselves too. Dry spots, 
elaborations, explorations that seem unrevealing, and even a turn or two of 
Self-Laureating while the strength gathers for another mortal departure. 
</P>
<P>
A broken road, an alternating possession and dispossession, have been the 
condition of most of the best poets, at least since advances in public health 
and the availability of teaching jobs encourage them to live past 30. But it 
particularly comes to mind with Heaney, because he has a belief about a poet's 
progress. He suggests that the early and middle stages have to do with finding 
and mastering the individuality of roots, experience and voice; with becoming 
wonderfully oneself. 
</P>
<P>
This is as far as many excellent poets go, developing full power and an 
unmistakable style. But there can be another stage, an overdrive. After 
exploring the voice to its limits, poets may work free of it -- free of their 
images, landscapes, battlefields and perfected complexities. 
</P>
<P>
Heaney has found signs of this lightening divestment in the later stages of 
such poets as Yeats, Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop and others. And of his own 
20-odd years of writing, he tells us in a prefatory note: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to believe that, in the course of that time span, a voice which began 
to be 'found' proceeded on some happy occasions to 'free' itself as well." 
</P>
<P>
You can think of the simplicity, which is not really simple at all, of 
Beethoven's last quartets or Bach's "Art of the Fugue." Or you can think of 
Tolstoy moving from the splendor of his novels into "pure" but also empty 
exhorting; and into the railroad station where, finally divesting, he ran off 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can judge the broken road until it is ended. "Why are you going 
downhill?" the reader worries. Readers who love a poet love what they know, not 
what they cannot know yet. In broken country you have to go down to get to the 
start of a higher hill, but in poetry the hill doesn't exist unless the writer 
makes it exist; and even the writer can't see it clearly or know what it will 
amount to. 
</P>
<P>
In 50 years it will not matter -- I assume public health will not have improved 
that much -- whether Heaney's most living poems came at the beginning, middle 
or end of his span. Or rather, because things are hardly ever that neat, where 
they will tend to cluster. To try to pronounce about it now would not only be 
stupid but perverse. 
</P>
<P>
So: It is an excellent thing to have these nine dozen and more poems, written 
over 21 years, in a new volume. To call it "Selected Poems 1966-1987" is 
accurate, inevitable and perfectly all right. Except that, in the sense I have 
suggested, it can be misleading. It led me to think I was going to review it, 
and perhaps to mislead anyone who has read this far into expecting that I 
would. A review is a judgment; I won't judge the road; I resign the perch. 
</P>
<P>
I will walk a few steps, though, unperched. The poems that brought Heaney into 
such light -- the poems of the Irish land and boggy roots, those that dig into 
myth and the peat-preserved remains of the old dwellers, those that tell of 
growing up through and out of history, those that tell of the pain of Northern 
Ireland's division -- these still shine the most strongly for me. 
</P>
<P>
I respond more coolly to others: those that seek to transform the specific 
beyond some -- admittedly -- undefinable point of formal and conceptual 
elaboration and refinement. I find the Glanmore sonnets in "Field Work" (1979) 
rather empty, for example. Some of the selections from "Station Island" and 
"The Haw Lantern" seem to me to show not so much a voice freeing itself as 
poems freeing themselves from any voice at all; through an austere complexity 
of fragmented images and emotions. A lot of accomplished contemporary poetry 
seeks for that, but Heaney can do more. 
</P>
<P>
And does. Of the poems that I believe give him his stature, I find many in the 
early and middle years. Right at the start there is "Follower," with his 
childhood memory of stumbling over tillage after his plowman-father, "His 
shoulders globed like a full sail strung/Between the shafts and the furrow." 
And now, he is grown, and compelled to write of these root matters: 
</P>
<P>
 I was a nuisance, tripping, falling, 
</P>
<P>
 Yapping always. But today 
</P>
<P>
 It is my father who keeps stumbling 
</P>
<P>
 Behind me, and will not go away. 
</P>
<P>
 There is "Gifts of Rain," more mature, and a masterpiece. It tells the 
prehistory and history of his country in the image of a farmer in the eternal 
Irish rain: 
</P>
<P>
 Still mammal. 
</P>
<P>
 Straw-footed on the mud, 
</P>
<P>
 He begins to sense weather 
</P>
<P>
 By his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in the drowned plow-land: 
</P>
<P>
 A man wading lost fields 
</P>
<P>
 Breaks the pane of flood: 
</P>
<P>
 A flower of mud -- 
</P>
<P>
 Water blooms up to his reflection 
</P>
<P>
 Like a cut swaying 
</P>
<P>
 Its red spoors through a basin. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, poets have looked up to the sky or across to horizons. Heaney's 
specific and original gesture -- seeking out the fatality that dogged his 
people -- was to look down, into the bog and the sedimentary layers of history. 
And when he comes to the present, after his haunting poems about the mummified 
remains of Vikings and ancient Celts, he goes beneath the wars of Protestant 
and Catholic neighbors and finds the pain that lies under. He fixes this pain 
with a sharpness that mocks 20 years of the world's journalism, and suggests 
that poetry is the real news. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he departs from such themes, I sometimes find him labored or brittle. 
Yet he never has really pulled away; he keeps circling back. His lovely 
"Sweeney Astray," published in 1983, is ostensibly the retelling of an Irish 
epic, but it is all Heaney -- astray himself, perhaps, from the burden of the 
departures. Vacations are known to hatch masterpieces; perhaps that's even a 
slantwise aspect of what Heaney means by "freeing" his voice. 
</P>
<P>
And in "The Haw Lantern," along with work that seems to me more searching than 
rewarding, there is some extraordinary freeing, most notably in the shining 
lucidity of sonnets to his dying mother. In the seventh, the family is at the 
bedside where she has just died: 
</P>
<P>
 The space we stood around had been emptied 
</P>
<P>
 Into us to keep, it penetrated 
</P>
<P>
 Clearances that suddenly stood open. 
</P>
<P>
 The last sonnet opens these clearances all the way. Heaney writes of the 
felling of the family's chestnut tree, planted when he was a baby: 
</P>
<P>
 I heard the hatchet's differentiated 
</P>
<P>
 Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh 
</P>
<P>
 And collapse of what luxuriated 
</P>
<P>
 Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep-planted and long gone, my coeval 
</P>
<P>
 Chestnut from a jam jar in a hole, 
</P>
<P>
 Its heft and hush become a bright nowhere, 
</P>
<P>
 A soul ramifying and forever 
</P>
<P>
 Silent, beyond silence listened for.

CAN JUSTICE BE MASS-PRODUCED?; 
</P>
<P>
ROUGH JUSTICE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF A YOUNG D.A. BY DAVID HEILBRONER (PANTHEON 
BOOKS: $19.95; 280 PP.; 0-394-58191-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Nava, Nava spent three years as a prosecutor for the Los Angeles 
City Attorney's office. He is also the author of three novels, the most recent 
of which, How Town was published by Harper &amp; Row in April. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Heilbroner's vivid account of his three years as an assistant district 
attorney in Manhattan should be compulsory reading for every politician whose 
answer to crime is more jails and longer sentences. The criminal-law system 
revealed here is an insatiable bureaucracy whose single goal is to "keep the 
cases moving" without much regard to notions of justice. In this system, which 
Heilbroner calls "assembly-line litigation," the gravity of a crime is 
measured, ultimately, by what it's worth in a plea bargain rather than by the 
degree to which it offends the social contract. 
</P>
<P>
In "Rough Justice," Heilbroner shows how he attempted to obey the bureaucratic 
imperative without becoming a bureaucrat. Tellingly, after three years, he 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Heilbroner, whose father is a professor and whose mother writes children's 
books, seems an unlikely prosecutor. He had been attracted to the job of 
district attorney because he thought it would satisfy his curiosity about the 
"dark world of criminal law" while putting his law degree to a socially useful 
purpose. And he had been encouraged by his first mentor at the office, who told 
new recruits that they had not been hired merely to "win cases and seek the 
maximum penalty" but to "do justice." 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing more seductive to a freshly coined lawyer than that siren 
song; doing justice, after all, is the ratio decidendi of the profession. In 
theory, prosecutors, with their significant discretionary powers, actually may 
be in a position to carry out the collective fantasy. As Heilbroner points out, 
it is the prosecutor who decides whether to file a case or seek a grand-jury 
indictment, whether to reduce a charge or even dismiss a weak case in the 
interests of justice. While a defense attorney has but a single client to 
represent, the prosecutor, as attorney for the People, represents the system 
itself -- the system by which justice, however imperfectly, must be dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as Heilbroner soon learned, in practice the prosecutor's discretionary 
powers are circumscribed by both political and bureaucratic necessity. For 
instance, district attorneys are sometimes compelled to crack down on 
relatively minor criminal activity in response to constituent complaints -- 
witness the prostitution sweeps in Hollywood a few years back. Inevitably, the 
effect of such a hard line is to clog up court calendars with marginal cases 
that would otherwise have been rejected at filing or reduced. More often, it's 
simply the need to keep the cases moving that sets the limits on the exercise 
of discretion. 
</P>
<P>
With so many cases, only a few can be considered thoughtfully and only a tiny 
fraction can make it to trial. The system's solution? Squeeze dazed pleas of 
guilty from unsophisticated criminal defendants, a process that left Heilbroner 
"sick at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Heilbroner also was disillusioned by his relationship with the police. Although 
the police are indispensable to the prosecution, police officers and 
prosecutors make an uneasy team because each suspects the other may be subtly 
selling his teammate out. Police officers complain that prosecutors engage in 
legal hair-splitting when they reject meritorious cases or reduce or even 
dismiss others. Prosecutors, in turn, may come to believe (as did Heilbroner) 
that the police routinely violate proscriptions against illegal searches and 
seizures and then lie about the violations in order to secure filings and 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the two sides are operating under different notions of justice, making 
clashes both inevitable and rancorous. Heilbroner was sufficiently upset by his 
experience with what he sees as police duplicity that he advocates fining and 
ultimately prosecuting officers who engage in illegal searches, seizures and 
arrests. What the police thought about him is not recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Heilbroner is equally dubious about another of the system's sacred cows, the 
insanity defense. Under the M'Naughten Rule, first set forth in the mid-19th 
Century, a criminal defendant could not be held responsible for his crimes if 
"a disease of the mind" prevented his knowing the "nature and quality of his 
acts" or distinguishing "right from wrong." The M'Naughten Rule remains the 
cornerstone of the modern insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
One of Heilbroner's early assignments was to the city's insane asylum, where he 
represented the People at hearings that determined whether inmates adjudged 
criminally insane had become "non-dangerous" and eligible for release. It was 
here that he came up against the contradictions inherent in the insanity 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the inmates were compelled to commit their criminal 
acts by mental illness, nonetheless Heilbroner observed that their illness "did 
not rob them of the ability to understand what they were doing at the time 
(they committed the crimes), or (to) grasp the proceedings that determined 
their fate." How, then, he wondered, could the insanity plea be justified? 
Putting this question to his supervisor, he was told that the insanity defense 
is "the right thing to do. End of story." 
</P>
<P>
Right by whose standards? the reader may well ask. Implied throughout 
Heilbroner's book is the question of whether the criminal-justice system has 
any moral content at all, or if it operates simply on principles of 
bureaucratic and political expediency. The question was vividly dramatized for 
me in a little story Heilbroner tells about being yelled at by a judge who 
found Heilbroner's plea offer on a "farebeat," e.g., a defendant charged with 
hopping a subway turnstile, excessive. Because the defendant had many previous 
arrests, Heilbroner asked for 60 days. The incredulous judge replied, "Sixty 
days for a farebeat? Listen, Mister, you better get it together or you'll be 
practicing law in Poughkeepsie." 
</P>
<P>
"Getting it together" means, in this context, learning how to keep the cases 
moving. To that end, each offense, from farebeat to first-degree murder, is 
worth a certain amount of time from which there is virtually no variation. This 
kind of law-by-numbers may move things along but what it provides is 
statistical uniformity, not justice. 
</P>
<P>
Heilbroner clearly is troubled by this lack of justice but fails to truly 
grapple with his concern. His book suffers from a sort of identity crisis in 
that he wants to have written both a picaresque memoir of his passage through 
the criminal justice system and an indictment of that system. Some of his 
anecdotes actually serve his polemic purposes, but many seem included simply 
for their bizarreness. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his literary purposes would have been better served either through 
fiction or a frank nonfiction expose. Still, "Rough Justice" is a useful 
antidote to the lynch-mob mentality that the mere mention of crime seems to 
inspire these days, a mentality perhaps best typified by gubernatorial 
candidates posing proudly next to the pictures of criminal defendants whom they 
promise they will, if elected, send to their deaths.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: 'THE MILL ON THE FLOSS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ESPEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Love's closing column for this feature having been a confession of his 
long failure to recognize the merits of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice," it 
is only fitting that I should introduce myself by admitting that at age 13 I 
summarily wrote off the works of George Eliot in disgust on the ground that in 
"Adam Bede" she had suddenly produced a pregnant Hetty Sorrell without, as I 
felt in my all-knowing ignorance, having given the reader the slightest warning 
of the poor girl's condition. Thus I was astonished in the course of my 
required reading in college to discover a totally different and vastly improved 
George Eliot, a mistress of comic irony and wit, a caustic critic of 
established religion, an acute sensibility responsive to the emotional and 
physical needs of individuals chafing against the stultifying restraints of 
"correct" and "moral" society. 
</P>
<P>
George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) was brought up in Warwickshire in a 
constrictingly conventional religious atmosphere. In the opening chapters of 
"The Mill on the Floss," she makes good use of the local dialect in creating 
Mr. Tulliver, the obstinate owner of Dorlcote Mill, who has deliberately chosen 
to marry a woman he considers his intellectual inferior so that she will be an 
obedient wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>
He naturally favors his son Tom over his unpredictable and impulsive daughter 
Maggie. Tom will, he hopes, rise in the social world if given a sufficient 
education. Tom may even become the equal of his father's particular enemy, 
Wakem, who has bested Tulliver in the matter of a dam controlling the flow of 
water in the Ripple, a small tributary to the river Floss. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Tom's loving sister Maggie, intense and sensitive, is 
intellectually and emotionally her prosaic brother's superior. Nevertheless, 
her feeling for him remains central in her life, and she feels abandoned when 
Tom is sent off to live in the household of Mr. Stelling, a clergyman who takes 
a few resident students for tutorials. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of the novel lies in the relationship of brother and sister, with 
Tom growing more and more distant and bound by convention, while Maggie senses 
a different world without any real opportunity to enter it except through her 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"In writing the history of unfashionable families," Eliot observes, "one is apt 
to fall into a tone of emphasis, which is very far from being the tone of good 
society, where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely moderate 
kind but are always presupposed, no subjects being eligible but such as can be 
touched with a light and graceful irony. But then, good society has its claret 
and its velvet carpets, its dinner engagements six weeks deep, its opera and 
its faery ball-rooms; rides off its ennui on thoroughbred horses, lounges at 
the club, has to keep clear of crinoline vortices, gets its science done by 
Faraday, and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best 
houses: How should it have time or need for belief and emphasis?" 
</P>
<P>
Listening to such a passage superbly read by Eileen Atkins, an English actress, 
on a Cover to Cover Cassette, may prove a hazard to even the most accomplished 
freeway driver, but the risk is well worth taking. And throughout the 9 hours 
and 20 minutes of this brilliantly modulated reading of Eliot's prose, even an 
enthusiast thoroughly familiar with the novel will hear freshly sensitive 
nuances set against the broader comedy of Mrs. Tulliver's two sisters, "the 
redoubtable Mrs. Clegg and the melancholic Mrs. Pullett." 
</P>
<P>
Many 19th-Century novels were deliberately written for family entertainment, 
suitable for evening reading to a group made up of children and adults, and 
thus communicating on more than one level. But "The Mill on the Floss," with 
its criticism of prevailing mores, was not one of these. Given the 
unsympathetic world in which Maggie lived -- and she eventually is 
"compromised" in the terms of that world -- her life is destined to end in some 
measure of tragedy. In today's world, this might not be true, but as for Tom, 
he is ever with us. I leave it to the individual listener to fill in the blank. 
</P>
<P>
Though the senior Tullivers were not modeled on the Evans family, the 
relationship between Maggie and Tom was intensified in Eliot's own life by the 
fact that she had broken with convention in 1854, at age 35, and joined George 
Henry Lewes, a versatile writer, in a union outside of marriage that lasted 
until his death in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
When she began writing "The Mill on the Floss," following the enormous success 
of "Adam Bede" (despite its flaws in my 13-year-old eyes), she was 38 and had 
informed her brother, Isaac Evans, that she was living with Lewes. Isaac 
answered her through the family solicitor and forbade their ailing sister, 
Chrissey, to correspond with Mary Ann. In spite of this, Chrissey, dying of 
consumption, wrote to her sister in defiance of Isaac, saying she regretted the 
end of their correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
Eliot herself lived in fear that her pseudonym might be discovered, for she 
realized that to have it known that the writer of books "praised for their 
lofty moral tone" was living out of wedlock might well be fatal to her career. 
Cut off as she was from all family affection, Eliot could recover her love for 
Isaac and their "old, old home" only through fiction, and Tom and Maggie's 
tragic final union was clearly planned from the beginning and was not, as Henry 
James speculated, "a tardy expedient for the solution of Maggie's 
difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
If, like me, you read George Eliot before you could understand her, or rebelled 
against the high school assignment of "Silas Marner," here is your chance to 
listen to a voice from the past that speaks clearly to the present.

Father, one summer I was seven, 
</P>
<P>
on a Sunday, the usual day 
</P>
<P>
for miracles, 
</P>
<P>
you held me and my brother

<P>
all afternoon

<P>
slapping the river.

<P>
Told us to open our eyes underwater

<P>
There,

<P>
I saw the current combing your legs,

small and sturdy,

the tired legs of a barber. 
</P>
<P>
Later you swam where it was deep 
</P>
<P>
with us clinging to your neck 
</P>
<P>
until you said let go, 
</P>
<P>
knowing that we wouldn't sink.

<P>
At dusk we drove back to town

<P>
and didn't tell you how much water

we had swallowed all day,

how we felt the slice of moon

tickling our bellies,

Barry Gifford's slim novel follows the improbable odyssey of two misfits: 
Sailor Ripley, a dim ne'er-do-well, and Lula Pace Fortune, a small-town 
Southern girl who's brighter than Sailor but not by much. Together they head 
west in Lula's Bonneville, seeking "room to move," even though it means Sailor 
must break parole and Lula must abandon her domineering mother. Not much 
happens to the pair, but Gifford's exceptional ear for dialogue captures not 
only regional idioms but also inflections, including the flirtatious Southern 
mannerism of turning statements into questions.

Although Nobel Prize-winner Naguib Mahfouz is regarded as the premier novelist 
of the Arab world, little of his work is known in the West. Originally 
published in 1965, this newly translated novel focuses on the moral failure of 
the Egypt intelligentsia after the overthrow of King Farouk. 
</P>
<P>
The central character, Omar al-Hamzawi, has lost all commitment to the ideals 
he espoused as a young man. Material success has supplanted the missionary zeal 
for socialism for which he once risked jail; the dreamy poet-revolutionary has 
been transformed into a property owner and a man of means. When a nagging 
emptiness begins to torment him, Omar embarks on a series of vapid liaisons 
(his fleeting relations with women could scarcely be described as love 
affairs). But an encounter with an old comrade who has preserved his belief in 
his ideals -- despite years of imprisonment and torture -- forces Omar to 
confront the irrelevance of his existence. Mahfouz continually shifts the 
narration among the first, second and third persons to offer differing 
reactions and create a fluid, almost Cubist perspective.

Yet another tale of angst, alienation and ennui in New York City. By day, 
Alexander Vine works as a doorman at a ritzy Midtown hotel; by night, he prowls 
the seamy underworld of the Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
As the Manhattan drug scene has become passe, Jonathan Ames uses the narrator's 
morbid interest in street prostitutes and bums as a metaphor for the 
degradation lurking behind the urban glitter. (Vine also consorts with gay men, 
enabling Ames to drag in the threat of AIDS as an unconvincing demon ex 
machina.) The conceit might have worked if Ames had created a character who 
embodied either the wealth or sleaze that surrounds him. But Vine lacks the 
requisite aspirations and predatory appetites: He's just another uninteresting 
loser in the big city, and the weak-limbed prose of "I Pass Like Night" 
collapses under the weight of its pretentions.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Corbett served as a colonial administrator in northern India during the 
1940s, up to the time of India's independence and partition. 
</P>
<P>
The sketches in this volume of memoirs focus on his efforts to help the 
peasants in their struggles with poverty, disease, robbers, bureaucracy and 
wild animals (including the requisite man-eating tigers). Although Corbett 
writes with obviously sincere affection about "my friends, the poor of India," 
he patronizes them furiously: Secure in his status as a lord of the Earth, he 
surveys the humble and meek from his lofty vantage point. A curious souvenir of 
the final days of the British Raj.

THE MERCHANT MARINE AND THE IRAQ EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Miles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contacted by telephone in New Jersey, John McPhee commented to a Times reporter 
on the implications of the Persian Gulf crisis for the American merchant marine 
and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly become very easy to get a job," he said. His book, "Looking for 
a Ship" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), deals extensively with recent 
competition among merchant seamen for scarce work. Because of the American 
military buildup in the Persian Gulf, "Every available ship has been pressed 
into service," and work is no longer scarce. 
</P>
<P>
But if work is suddenly abundant on the merchant fleet, it remains true that 
the fleet itself is a shadow of what it once was. "During the past 10 or 15 
years, the fleet has shrunk by 85%," and at the present moment, "No ship is 
under construction in any shipyard in the United States, none at all, none 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding is down worldwide, McPhee says. Though the Koreans and the Germans 
have continued some shipbuilding and the Japanese may not be completely out of 
the business, the Scandinavians, he says, to name a one-time shipbuilding 
giant, have quit the game altogether. That the United States has done the same, 
McPhee implies, may yet be cause for national regret. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee's book reports the astonishing fact (see adjoining review) that most 
merchant ships are, by design, defenseless against piracy. Even a small, armed 
boarding party can steal whatever cargo it wishes. The skeleton crews that man 
the gigantic cargo vessels have no alternative but to stand by and watch the 
theft take place. 
</P>
<P>
What then of American forces seeking to blockade Iraq? Would small armed 
boarding parties be enough to force merchant ships bound for that country to 
change course, return to harbor, etc.? McPhee thinks that the answer is quite 
possibly yes. Our memory of World War II, he says, is of cargo ships sunk, not 
of cargo ships seized. But much may change in a new era of essentially unarmed 
merchant shipping. Jack Miles

U.S. EMBASSY'S WATER, POWER CUT OFF BY IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: TROOPS KEEP PRESSURE ON KUWAIT COMPOUND. ALLIED SHIPS ARE PREPARED 
TO USE FORCE TO CARRY OUT THE U.N. RESOLUTION ON EMBARGO.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi forces cut off power and water to the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait 
Saturday as U.S. and allied navies in the region readied their guns to enforce 
a new U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force to block all shipping to and 
from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the embassy's electricity was severed about 1:15 a.m. PDT 
and water was shut off sometime later. Telephone service was sporadic, but 
embassy officials continued to maintain some contact with the estimated 2,500 
Americans trapped in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen armed Iraqi troops who took up positions around the U.S. Embassy 
compound Friday were blocking entry and exit from the buildings but had not 
attempted to enter the grounds, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the embassy was operating on a single gasoline-powered 
generator that provided only limited cooling power. "It leaves us hot and dry," 
one official said. The officials said they did not know how long the gasoline 
would last or the extent of the embassy's water reserves. 
</P>
<P>
A source involved in managing the crisis said the Iraqis had shut off only one 
of two water mains that supply the building. But the remaining water main 
spewed out dirty, sludge-filled water, and the Americans had to turn it off 
themselves, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraq's provocative actions at the embassy in Kuwait, the Bush 
Administration appeared content with passage early Saturday of the historic 
U.N. resolution for which the United States had lobbied heavily for a week. 
Neither the White House nor the Pentagon indulged in the kind of belligerent 
language that has marked Administration statements of recent days. 
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf, the northern Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, U.S. Navy 
vessels and ships from several other nations continued to shadow about a dozen 
Iraqi commercial ships, prepared to halt them by force if they attempt to 
unload their cargo. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said two Iraqi oil tankers were being watched particularly 
closely because they were nearing ports but noted that no action to interdict 
them was likely until late today at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
The warships were operating under a new mandate from the U.N. Security Council, 
which overwhelmingly authorized the use of military force to back up a stiff 
trade embargo levied on Iraq in the wake of its military takeover of Kuwait on 
Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution permits "measures commensurate to the specific circumstances . . 
. to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution made no mention of air traffic. U.S. officials said Friday that 
some military supplies and other goods continued to arrive in Iraq from Libya 
and unspecified other nations, but that no military action would be taken to 
interdict the air shipments. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials said no new orders had been issued to naval commanders 
in the region as a result of the U.N. action. Rules of engagement for U.S. 
warships issued earlier allow progressive enforcement measures, beginning with 
radio warnings and ending with sinking a suspect ship if the U.N. embargo is 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in a television interview, declined 
to detail rules governing the use of force to halt shipping. He said only that 
American vessels will use "the minimum amount of interference with traffic in 
order to make the sanctions effective." 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council action provided further international justification for 
measures the United States was prepared to take unilaterally, Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those nations with military vessels in the region or on the way are 
Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Australia, Spain and 
several Persian Gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy officials are trying to establish cooperative relationships with the 
other naval powers, both to avoid accidents and to give any enforcement action 
a clear international cast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a multinational force in the formal sense. There's no central command 
structure," one senior Pentagon official said. "It's cooperative, but I can't 
say now exactly how that will play out in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Naval commanders in the region are working out informal zones of 
responsibility, as they did during the tanker escort operation in the gulf in 
1988, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced that planes from the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing were 
being deployed to Saudi Arabia from their base at Lakenheath in Britain. The 
wing flies F-111 aircraft, long-range bombers that were used in the 1986 U.S. 
raid on Libya. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iraq 's ambassador said the wives and children of American 
diplomats who fled Kuwait to Baghdad will be allowed to leave Iraq, but the 
diplomats will be kept as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials protested the action as another example of Iraqi 
duplicity. Baghdad had promised that the 100 U.S. Embassy personnel, Marine 
guards and dependents who left the embassy in Kuwait on Thursday would be 
allowed to leave Iraq through Jordan or Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Summoned to the State Department for another U.S. protest, Iraqi Ambassador 
Mohammed Mashat told reporters, "We are on the brink of a catastrophe. . . . 
American lives are being risked for no reason whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat said "we are not going to use force" against the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait, where Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and a staff of about 10 
defied Iraqi orders to shut down by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't touched any embassy there," the Iraqi said at an impromptu news 
conference at the State Department after a brief session with David Mack, a 
deputy assistant secretary of state who had called him in. 
</P>
<P>
In his televised interview, Scowcroft said that seizing the U.S. and other 
embassies was "very counterproductive." He warned Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein to "refrain from any action against" the Americans and other foreigners 
held in Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft added that while Bush is deeply concerned about the fate of the 
estimated 3,000 Americans trapped in the two countries, the President would not 
alter his policy solely to save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"That will not be the case," Scowcroft said. "The hostages are on the 
President's mind constantly, and (in) everything we do, we will think about the 
hostages. They will not divert us, however, from our strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The Voice of America radio service advised the 2,500 Americans trapped in 
Kuwait not to go near the embassy while the Iraqi soldiers remained, even 
though there appeared to be no attempt to take over the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department broadcast on VOA said the embassy was "determined to 
continue working for your release from Kuwait and your safe return to your 
families." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to flush out Americans and other foreign nationals who 
may be in hiding, Iraq threatened to hang anyone caught providing shelter for 
foreigners in either Iraq or Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who shelters a foreigner with the aim of hiding him from the 
authorities will be committing a crime of espionage," the Iraqi government said 
in a radio broadcast monitored by Reuters. "He will be hanged for such a 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Following a marathon U.N. session that ended after 4 a.m., U.S. Ambassador 
Thomas R. Pickering called the vote "one of the most important decisions in its 
history." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has evaded resolutions of the Security Council and thumbed its nose at 
all humanity," Pickering said. "This is not an act of war, but an enforcement 
of sanctions which have been flagrantly violated." 
</P>
<P>
The five permanent Security Council members are the United States, the Soviet 
Union, Britain, China, and France. The 10 other current members are Canada, 
Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Cuba were the only countries that abstained from the Security Council 
vote. Yemen's ambassador, Abdallah Saleh Ashtal, warned that any military 
action backing the sanctions might lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
Yemen, meanwhile, said it was fully complying with the U.N. embargo and would 
refuse to allow Iraqi tankers to unload oil at its terminal. At least one Iraqi 
oil carrier, the Khanaqin, is anchored off the Yemeni port of Aden, having been 
denied permission to discharge its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said the Security Council vote "further strengthens the world 
resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolve of the international community is strong. The vote exhibits the 
commitment of the world to act effectively to achieve the complete, immediate 
and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait," White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari, immediately denounced the Security 
Council vote and said it could lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
"This use of force by the United States or any of its allies or puppets will 
lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will burn all in their path," 
he said at the United Nations in New York.

FIRST BATCH OF STATE'S RESERVES CALLED TO DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The first California reservists were called to duty Saturday as the secretary 
of the Navy ordered more than 800 medical personnel to report to military 
hospitals from San Diego to Bremerton, Wash., to replace doctors, nurses and 
technicians who have been deployed or are headed for bases and medical ships in 
the tense Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The call-ups follow President Bush's decision last Wednesday to authorize the 
use of the so-called "weekend warriors." More than 49,000 armed forces 
reservists are expected to be involved by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy also placed on standby two sophisticated reserve units 
specializing in the electronic surveillance of seaports, as well as four 
sea-lift details. Those units joined three other supply-oriented reserve units 
that were placed on standby Friday. They include an Army group specializing in 
the supply and purification of water and two National Guard trucking units. 
</P>
<P>
The quick activation of medical and supply reservists had been anticipated 
since Wednesday when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney outlined the military's 
immediate needs. But the notification of two Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare 
(MIUW) units represented something of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The MIUW units -- one based in Long Beach, the other in San Francisco -- are 
trained in the operation of sophisticated radio and sonar equipment for the 
monitoring of harbor activity. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in essence a harbor defense unit," said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Gay of the 
Navy's regional reserve headquarters in San Diego. Their mission, he said, is 
to conduct both surface and subsurface surveillance for the protection of 
ports, harbors, anchorages and "offshore economic assets." 
</P>
<P>
"These units are self-supporting and can be rapidly deployed," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear on Saturday where the MIUW units may be deployed if definitive 
orders to activate come. The four sea-lift units put on standby Saturday 
include two in Alameda, one in Santa Barbara and one in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said that about 500 medical reservists had been called up in a Navy reserve 
region that includes Southern California, Arizona and southern Nevada. In 
Northern California, 380 medical reservists had been activated, a Navy 
spokesman in San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, the call-up abruptly disrupted lives, bringing to some a 
welcome new challenge and to others an unwanted detour. 
</P>
<P>
Child-care arrangements were being hastily made. Work left undone at civilian 
jobs was to be left hanging. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this is happening," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Pam Slayton, 
fighting back tears as she clutched her orders at the Naval and Marine Corps 
Reserve Center on Stadium Way north of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton, a 31-year-old corpsman, is to report for duty at Camp Pendleton. Her 
husband, who is on active duty with the Navy, was transferred five days ago 
from Long Beach to Bremerton, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton, who in her civilian life is a computer technician for Southern 
California Gas Co., had been hoping to move to Bremerton -- and switch reserve 
units -- to be with her husband. Now the immediate concern is who will take 
care of their two children, ages 5 and 7. They can't go to Camp Pendleton with 
her Wednesday because she will be in barracks, Slayton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who'll take care of them -- relatives, my mom, somebody," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she joined the reserves several years ago to get benefits while going 
to technical school, adding, "I guess it's time to pay the Navy back." 
</P>
<P>
But Petty Officer 3rd Class Kenneth Pacis, also a corpsman in the same unit as 
Slayton, said he reported to the center Saturday "ready and willing to go." 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Downey resident said he "got kinda nervous when he arrived home 
from a Dodger game Friday night to find a message from a roommate informing him 
that the Navy had called him up." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep too well," he said, "But I calmed down when I learned we were 
not going overseas, at least not for now." 
</P>
<P>
A recent graduate of UCLA, Pacis said he had just last week secured a 
management job but had not yet started. "I guess I'll be letting that job go," 
he said. "When this is over, I'll have to start over." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors assigned to the Naval Reserve Center in Tustin who were called to 
active duty "really want to go" and "really want to support their country," 
said Lt. Cmdr. M. K. Carlock, commanding officer of the reserve medical unit. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Edward H. Bestard, a San Clemente orthopedic surgeon who received 
orders to report to Tustin early Saturday, said he was told the hospital there 
was "almost empty." 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost nobody left, I heard," Bestard said after he completed his 
orders to report to the seaside base on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But the physicians will not report to the hospital until the middle of next 
week. "They don't have to be in the bus tomorrow morning or anything like 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Henk, an AIDS nurse at the UC Davis Medical Center, was among 
the reservists who reported to duty in Sacramento. Henk, who will be assigned 
to Bremerton, had no complaints about going because "I agree with President 
Bush that this is what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
But the 35-year-old Roseville nurse said things will be difficult at home for 
her husband, Robert, a lawyer, and daughters, ages 2 and 5. The 5-year-old 
cried when told her mother was leaving, Henk said, and her husband is a "little 
anxious. He'll have to pay the bills and do all the things I used to do." 
</P>
<P>
At the Naval Station at Treasure Island in San Francisco, 13 medical reserve 
units were ordered to report. The units included 380 doctors, nurses and other 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the Bay Area reserves called to active duty on Saturday will report 
to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland. Some of Oak Knoll's regular-duty 
doctors and nurses have been deployed in preparation for casualties in an Iraqi 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff has held together. Morale has been good. This is what we train for. 
This is the real thing," said Lt. Ed DeJose, executive officer in charge of 
ensuring the reserves' readiness at Treasure Island. DeJose, who had been 
working since midnight, said he planned to continue on the job for "as long as 
I can keep my eyelids from falling shut."

SOUTHLAND AIRPORTS ARE THREATENED WITH GRIDLOCK. AND, WITH NO CENTRALIZED 
PLANNING, IT'S LIKELY TO GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

<P>
Southern California -- land of the jet set and the frequent flier -- is edging 
dangerously close to airport gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Without new airfields or dramatic expansion of existing ones, flying to and 
from the Southland could become an intolerably expensive and punishing 
challenge by the turn of the century. Already, experts say, the region's 
airport capacity shortage is the country's third worst, trailing only Chicago 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
While alarming, the situation should come as no surprise to Southern 
California. Countless studies by planners and consultants have for years 
forecast mushrooming passenger and cargo demand -- and warned that the air 
transportation system was simply not keeping pace. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials -- aware that airports, like trash dumps, can be 
treacherous political land mines -- have not given the problem its proper place 
on the civic agenda, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, planning to expand and improve the regional airport network has 
mostly been a piecemeal effort, bedeviled by the independent nature and 
individual whims of each airfield's operator. 
</P>
<P>
Airport woes are not unique to Southern California. Indeed, national experts 
are hard-pressed to name more than a few major cities that have done a credible 
job on long-range airport planning. 
</P>
<P>
But with its vibrant economy, rapid population growth and tourist attractions, 
the Southland's situation is particularly precarious. 
</P>
<P>
"We give talks about this (airport) capacity problem around the country, and 
one of our favorite examples is Southern California," said Drew Steketee, 
executive director of the Washington-based Partnership for Improved Air Travel, 
a coalition of airlines, frequent fliers and shippers pushing for improvements 
in the nation's air transportation system. "You're in a real jam out there, and 
the consequences could be dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Projections by the Southern California Assn. of Governments tell a large part 
of the story: 
</P>
<P>
Without major expansion and improvement projects, Los Angeles International, 
Ontario, Burbank, John Wayne and Long Beach airports will be able to serve a 
combined total of about 63 million passengers annually by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, public demand for airplane seats at those five airports will have 
surged to 93 million, leaving 30 million would-be travelers essentially out of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where officials have been hunting for a new airport site for four 
decades, officials say pint-size Lindbergh Field will be at capacity within 10 
years. Parking lots and roads leading to the landlocked airport already are 
jammed beyond the point planners consider tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, demand will so exceed supply that fares will skyrocket and people 
simply won't be able to catch a flight whenever they want to," predicts Michael 
Armstrong, an aviation planner with SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be back to serving the flying elite," Armstrong said. "The victim will 
be the middle-income guy who wants to spend a long weekend in San Francisco. 
He's going to look at that $500 fare and say, 'Forget it, I'm staying home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the hassles awaiting travelers, manufacturers and other businesses 
that rely on aviation will suffer as cargo flights compete with passenger runs 
for available space. The regional economy could flag as tourists and industry 
-- discouraged by restricted air access -- go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few facilities in California, and especially Southern 
California, that generate more economic benefits and more jobs than do our 
airports," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), a ranking member of the House 
subcommittee on aviation. "When they get behind -- when growth moves faster 
than the development of airports to accommodate that increased travel -- we are 
losing that economic benefit." 
</P>
<P>
At the Federal Aviation Administration, Jim Wiggins agrees, calling the 
situation critical. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something soon, we will have extensive delay problems," said 
Wiggins, manager of planning and programming for the FAA's Western Pacific 
Region. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland, of course, is not facing this fate alone. Chicago, New York, 
Washington, Seattle, Atlanta -- these and many other metropolitan areas are or 
soon will be plagued with airport capacity shortages that threaten to reduce 
service, drive up fares and make convenient flying all but obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the FAA reports, at least 11 airports experience chronic delays 
because of traffic congestion. Absent any improvements, aerial gridlock will 
tie up 32 airports by 1996, causing a total of about 20,000 hours of delay. The 
cost of these holdups to passengers and shippers already totals about $3 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the crunch is clear: more people are flying, and many are flying 
more often. In 1977, the year before deregulation, 243 million people flew on 
commercial aircraft in the United States. A decade later, that number had 
almost doubled, reaching 468 million. And by the year 2000, the FAA predicts it 
will almost double again, climbing to 800 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only one major airport (Dallas-Ft. Worth) has been built in the last 
two decades. And only Austin, Tex., and Denver have firm plans for new 
airfields. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a doubling of passengers, a doubling of demand, and the 
infrastructure has just remained static," said Southwest Airlines Chairman Herb 
Kelleher. "Isn't it astounding that the United States, whose essential method 
for moving people is by air, has not built a new airport for 16 years? We must 
be mad." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take an aeronautical genius to figure out how Southern California 
wound up in its particular mess. For starters, most residents don't want new 
airports in their neighborhood, and many people living near existing airports 
would throw their bodies on the Tarmac -- or, like Newport Beach homeowners 
upset by jet noise at John Wayne, sue -- to ensure that those facilities do not 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
Although airports can be lucrative for communities, many residents believe any 
payoffs in dollars or jobs are eclipsed by the noise, air pollution and surface 
traffic the facilities generate. These foes frequently win the ear of 
politicians, despite pressure for expansion from passengers, airlines and even 
the federal government, which requires airports to make reasonable efforts to 
accommodate airborne interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"Airports are NIMBYs (Not-In-My-Back-Yard), just like jails," said Jerry 
Epstein, president of the Los Angeles Airport Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, although Southland planning agencies have completed enough airport 
studies to fill a jumbo jet, critics complain that a lack of unity has plagued 
efforts to attack the looming crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The result, some say, has been a sort of political sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on this problem for 12 years and we're no further ahead 
than we were when we started," said Hank Wedaa, a Yorba Linda city councilman 
and chairman of SCAG's aviation committee. "We've got tremendous knowledge, 
piles of reports . . . but we don't have anyone with the (guts) to stand up and 
make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pressure to find solutions to the congestion problems are 
mounting: 
</P>
<P>
* At Los Angeles International Airport, the nation's third-busiest, the 
passenger load is expected to grow to more than 60 million passengers annually 
by the year 2000. That's 10 million to 15 million passengers more than the 
existing terminals can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are afoot for new passenger and freight terminals, as well as a rail 
"people-mover" system to ferry travelers around. But environmental reviews and 
community anxiety about such growth could stall construction for years. 
Moreover, the cost of expansion -- along with the road and freeway improvements 
needed before all these people can get to the airport -- would run into the 
billions. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 5 million passengers opted for Ontario International Airport, owned 
by the Los Angeles Department of Airports, during 1989 -- twice the number that 
the facility was designed to handle. SCAG says that figure will more than 
double again during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the crush, officials are pushing for a $350-million terminal complex 
at Ontario, scheduled to open in 1995. But financing and environmental 
clearances have yet to be obtained. With its twin, 2-mile-long runways, Ontario 
probably could be redesigned to handle far more than 12 million passengers a 
year. But that's the limit set by the California Air Resources Board, which 
says a greater level of operations would degrade air quality. 
</P>
<P>
* Restricted by a court settlement to serving 4.5 million passengers annually, 
Orange County's John Wayne Airport is already what manager George Rebella calls 
"maxed out." Some relief will come next month when a new terminal -- part of a 
$310-million expansion -- opens and the allowable passenger ceiling climbs to 
8.4 million. But Rebella said that by 2005, demand will have surged to 22 
million passengers a year -- almost three times the airport's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Physical constraints and the threat of lawsuits make any further expansion of 
John Wayne unlikely, and the Board of Supervisors recently rejected potential 
sites for a new airport in Orange County. Instead, the politicians are looking 
for a solution 75 miles away and on someone else's turf -- the 
soon-to-be-closed George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, which some 
hope will be converted to a commercial airfield. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego -- the nation's sixth-largest city -- has outgrown Lindbergh Field, 
its tiny, landlocked airport on the edge of downtown. Aside from crowding 
problems, the field's single runway is so short that a 747 cannot take off with 
a full load of fuel. A package of improvements totaling $350 million are on the 
table, but the new terminal gates, parking structures and people-movers would 
at most squeeze 20 more years of life out of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, once hopeful that the Pentagon might permit commercial air service 
at Miramar Naval Air Station, is now contemplating a binational airport on the 
U.S.-Mexico border. Boosters, who envision shared runways and linked terminals 
on opposite sides of the border, say the joint facility could fly easily by 
building upon Tijuana's existing Rodriguez Airport. But skeptics say that 
hammering out the international agreements needed for such a venture could take 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
* Burbank Airport stands as the only Southland field to record a decline in 
passengers in recent years, dropping from 3.2 million in 1987 to 2.7 million in 
1989. The dip, however, probably has less to do with reduced demand than with 
airline mergers -- which have led to cutbacks in the regional flights to which 
Burbank is restricted because of its short runways -- and a policy allowing 
airport access only to "Stage III" aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
These late-model jetliners -- quieter than their predecessors -- make up only 
half the nation's commercial fleet, and airlines with many older planes find it 
inconvenient to use Burbank. The older craft, however, gradually are being 
replaced, and Burbank officials predict that demand will surge to 7 million 
passengers annually by 2000. Plans for new facilities to accommodate that load 
are meeting resistance from homeowners' groups -- especially Los Angeles 
residents on the airport's west side, land over which most planes departing 
Burbank fly. 
</P>
<P>
* Nowhere is the power of neighborhood concern over airport noise more evident 
than in Long Beach. In response to damage claims from residents, the spacious, 
municipal airport allows just 41 flights a day by Stage III aircraft and limits 
hours of service to between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The air carriers want more, arguing that the 1,166-acre field -- convenient to 
the Long Beach, San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways -- could play a vital 
role in solving Southern California's air travel crunch. But the Long Beach 
City Council has shown no sign of weakening in its resolve to keep a lid on 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons that the construction of a coordinated, up-to-date system of 
facilities to serve the flying public is lagging, especially in a large and 
diverse region like Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Except for LAX and Ontario, both of which function under the authority of the 
Los Angeles Department of Airports, the Southland's airports are a pretty 
independent lot. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have are all these different groups going off and doing their own 
studies, rather than putting their heads together and cooperating," said 
Barbara Lichman, a Newport Beach attorney who served on a panel that searched 
for a new airport site in Orange County. "It's very shortsighted and stupid." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Bruce Henderson echoes that view, saying that "there 
has been a lack of forward thinking" on the airport problem. 
</P>
<P>
"How do we coordinate all the Southern California airports and make the most 
efficient use of our runway space? That's a question no one is asking," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Packard hopes that part of the remedy lies in legislation he is drafting 
to require broad-based master planning of airports. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think where we'd be if, 20 years ago, we'd come up with a long-term plan 
and set aside land and asked cities to protect that land from encroachment," 
said Packard, who believes Southern California can serve as a model for an 
airport planning strategy nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Although SCAG officials favor more coordination, their top aviation specialist, 
Tim Merwin, suspects that local politics will always defy a cooperative 
solution. "Even if you get six counties in a given region to agree to build an 
airport in City A's jurisdiction, it's just not going to happen unless City A 
says it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions for some sort of regional super-agency -- something 
more powerful than SCAG, which does overall planning but has no decision-making 
authority in the development of the region's air facilities. But Cliff Moore, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Department of Airports, typifies many 
local officials who question the need for such an agency -- and wonder how much 
muscle it could truly flex. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you get away from local control," Moore observes, "you have to really 
have strong justification for it." 
</P>
<P>
Similar misgivings have greeted suggestions that the federal government play a 
stronger role in siting airports. Some experts believe the FAA could insulate 
airport construction from the perils of local politics by simply declaring a 
new airport a national priority, finding a site and getting the thing built. 
Others, however, say forget it: Congress would never usurp local authority over 
land-use matters. 
</P>
<P>
Even when decisive steps are taken to remedy the airport problem, unforeseen 
gremlins seem to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Airports, for example, has for years been 
counting on Palmdale as a future relief valve for much of the region's air 
traffic. Today, America West Airlines offers four round-trips daily between 
Palmdale and Las Vegas. But the Airport Department's ultimate goal is to turn 
the 36 square miles of sand, cactus and sagebrush it owns in the Antelope 
Valley into a bustling "superport." 
</P>
<P>
A competing proposal, however, envisions converting George Air Force Base -- on 
another swatch of desert in San Bernardino County -- into an international 
"megaport." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree privately that there is not enough demand for both airports, and 
with billions of dollars in enhanced real estate values hanging in the balance, 
the battle over the rival plans could span years. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, there isn't time for protracted fighting. Getting the necessary 
environmental clearances and then planning, building and opening new airport 
facilities cannot be done overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Denver has been at it for 10 years," Wiggins said. "And they're just breaking 
ground there." 
</P>
<P>
For this and other reasons, SCAG officials -- frustrated after watching for 
years as studies warning of the coming crisis stack higher and higher on 
politicians' bookshelves -- are skeptical of the prospects for any significant 
near-term relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely that we won't be successful in finding the new airport," 
Armstrong said. "So the question we're facing is, what do you do short of 
building a new facility to handle the demand?" 
</P>
<P>
New technology is one option. Growing interest in high-speed trains offers hope 
that rail service in the busiest air travel corridor -- Southern California to 
the Bay Area -- might be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
And, in addition to the expected introduction of wide-bodied, large-capacity 
jetliners on short-haul routes, some experts say that a hybrid craft called the 
tilt-rotor -- which takes off vertically from a small space, like a helicopter, 
and then rotates its engines to zip off like an airplane at 350 m.p.h. -- might 
provide some relief. 
</P>
<P>
Originally designed to carry combat troops, the tilt-rotor is considered a 
promising craft for civilian use. Prototypes can carry only several dozen 
passengers and are limited in range, but supporters say future models could be 
practical for use on congested commuter routes. Another advantage is that the 
tilt-rotor's vertical takeoff capability means it can be based virtually 
anywhere, and researchers already envision floating platforms and "vertiports" 
built over freeway interchanges and in urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
But technological relief will take years -- and cost millions -- to bring to 
reality, and thus some suggest a quicker answer to the crunch lies in the 
military bases scattered across the Southland. In the past, installations like 
Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in 
Orange County and Camp Pendleton have been flatly declared off limits by the 
Pentagon. Many feel it is time the Defense Department gave some ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I like having the Marines around, but they have to share," said Wedaa, who 
supports a commercial airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, special projects director for the San Diego Assn. of Governments, 
recalls an FAA study describing the nation's 23 most congested commercial 
airports. Within a short distance of each, he said, sat an under-used military 
airfield. 
</P>
<P>
"The relief valve at some point has simply got to be the military bases," 
Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
But even if such bases suddenly became available, opposition from neighboring 
residents would undoubtedly be an issue. Each time talk of flying commercial 
jetliners into El Toro comes up, angry shouts erupt from the folks in Irvine, 
Leisure World and other communities near the base. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, many experts predict that only the severe pain of the pending 
capacity crunch will usher in relief. Much like the old argument that commuters 
will take the bus or car-pool once the traffic gets unbearable, this theory 
holds that, ultimately, intolerable fares and a scarcity of flights will 
persuade the public something has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enough of an optimist that I won't say this problem is impossible, but 
it's pretty close," said Merwin, SCAG's aviation specialist. "We will have to 
experience a good deal of the effects of the shortfall -- higher fares, 
inconvenience -- before there is any push to remedy the problem."

GULF CRISIS: U.S. AND OTHER EMBASSIES IN KUWAIT ARE SURROUNDED BY IRAQI TROOPS. 
GORBACHEV MESSAGES HUSSEIN, CALLING THE SITUATION 'EXTEMELY DANGEROUS.'

Saddam Hussein made diplomats his latest target Friday, ringing foreign 
missions in Kuwait with Iraqi troops and detaining a group of U.S. Embassy 
staff and dependents who had been promised safe passage from his capital. 
Britain said tanks surrounded its embassy, and the water and power were cut. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats made Hussein a target too. The Soviet envoy to the United Nations 
said Friday that Moscow would back a U.S. resolution in the Security Council 
authorizing use of "minimum force" to halt all shipping to and from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The move cleared the final obstacle to council approval of the U.S. initiative, 
which would enforce the U.N.-ordered embargo of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent an urgent 
message to Hussein warning that the Persian Gulf situation was "extremely 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict came home to hundreds of U.S. military reservists called up in the 
first such summons since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Parliament speaker, Sadi Mehdi Saleh, said Friday that the presence of 
U.S. forces in the gulf might ignite a war that would set the region and its 
oil reserves afire and kill thousands of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
At least nine embassies in Kuwait -- including the U.S. and British missions -- 
were guarded by troops Friday as diplomats defied an Iraqi order to close their 
doors. With its Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait and its quick annexation of the small 
oil state, Iraq now considers Kuwait to be Iraqi territory. 
</P>
<P>
A European envoy said Baghdad threatened to use force to remove diplomats 
remaining at their posts over the weekend. The Iraqis also threatened to cut 
water and power to the missions, and the Foreign Office in London said they did 
just that on Friday at the British Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Like other embassies staying open, the U.S. mission had a skeleton staff of 
about 10. More than 100 U.S. Embassy staff and dependents, including about 30 
children, left Kuwait only to find new trouble in Baghdad, where they were 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the Iraqis had promised 
earlier to allow the group of Americans to leave, but then reneged. "They are 
safe," he said, but stuck. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency said later that Iraq would detain only the male 
embassy employees -- including diplomats -- of those countries that refused to 
close their embassies in occupied Kuwait. But there was no indication that the 
dependents were being allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry in Rome said that three Italian diplomats who left Kuwait 
Thursday were kept from leaving Baghdad on Friday, and that the reason cited 
was the Italian Embassy's refusal to close. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the diplomats, about 21,000 Westerners -- including 3,000 Americans -- 
were caught in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait by the invasion, and President 
Bush said they must be considered hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Getting out of Iraq was becoming harder even for people from countries not 
considered hostile toward Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, however, still let refugees cross over from Iraq despite Wednesday's 
announcement that the border would be closed to them. Jordan said coping with 
thousands of refugees had become too much of a burden. The European Community 
and others moved to help with money and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, another escape route for refugees, said it might close its border with 
Iraq unless countries whose nationals are coming through take steps to ensure 
quick transport elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's message to Hussein appeared to be a warning that the Soviet Union 
would go along with the Western powers unless Iraq quickly took steps to 
withdraw from Kuwait and free foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev urged Iraq to comply immediately with U.N. Security Council 
resolutions and warned that failure to do so would "inevitably prompt the 
Security Council to take corresponding additional measures," the Soviet news 
agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet ambassador to the U.N., Valentin V. Lozinskiy, later announced in 
New York that Moscow was ending its resistance to backing the U.N.-ordered 
embargo with military muscle. He also indicated that the Soviets would be 
willing to join an international force to police the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said that the Soviets 
had pulled all staff from their Kuwait embassy -- but insisted they had not 
formally closed it. The Soviets -- long an ally of Iraq -- cut off weapons 
supplies to Baghdad immediately after the invasion but say they still have 
scores of military advisers in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a dozen other 
Americans remained. The White House said the Iraqi troops outside the embassy 
in Kuwait "are not allowing people to enter or leave." 
</P>
<P>
Troops were reported surrounding or patrolling near the American, British, 
Canadian, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian and Hungarian 
embassies. Nations including Venezuela, the Philippines, India and Lebanon 
complied with the embassy-closing order. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's ambassador to Jordan, Ramon Armengod, said in Madrid that Iraqi 
authorities warned the Western diplomats that troops would forcibly remove them 
from their missions starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said Iraq warned Western embassies 
in Kuwait Friday night that their water and electricity would be cut off if the 
missions were not closed. No time frame was apparently given. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Iraqi soldiers told the two Japanese 
diplomats remaining in Kuwait Friday that their diplomatic immunity had been 
revoked but made no attempt to remove them from the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 European Community members indicated that they would seek an "explicit, 
firm condemnation" by the Security Council of Iraq's behavior if their 
embassies were interfered with. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arabian desert, Iraqi troops are confronting tens of thousands of U.S. 
troops deployed to deter further aggression by Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The American forces were being bolstered by reservists from half a dozen 
states, who were packing their bags and preparing to report for duty. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Mason, 21, of Columbus, Ga., shipping out for Saudi Arabia, said goodby 
to her husband and 3-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real thrilled with the idea of her going over there, but when you 
have to go, you go," said her 23-year-old husband, Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
The mobilization is expected to continue at least until Oct. 1. Bush has the 
authority to call up as many as 200,000 reserves for up to 180 days without 
declaring a national emergency. 
</P>
<P>
On the financial front, stock prices rebounded in Tokyo, Europe and New York 
Friday even as tensions intensified. Oil prices declined after matching record 
highs during Thursday trading. The price of crude fell $1.02 per barrel to 
$30.91 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers from most of the 13 nations making up the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to attend the talks in Vienna today, 
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said in Caracas.

U.N. OKD FORCE AFTER SOVIETS GAVE UP ON IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic U.N. Security Council decision authorizing the use of military 
force to blockade Iraq came after the Soviet Union abandoned hope that its 
former client could be persuaded by talk alone and decided to cast its lot with 
the West, officials involved in the negotiations said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The vote in the wee hours of Saturday morning -- a critical victory for the 
Bush Administration in its effort to win international backing in the crisis -- 
climaxed three weeks of intensive negotiations in which Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III spoke to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze by 
telephone as many as three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came late Friday afternoon after Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, his patience with Saddam Hussein at its limit, authorized Soviet 
diplomats to accede to a deal that omitted the word force and emphasized 
diplomacy, but left the military intentions unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, after reaching separate agreements with nonaligned nations, U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering emerged at 4:15 a.m. with the sought-after vote 
to sanction what could be the first battle shots fired in the conflict since 
Iraqi troops overran Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The diplomacy was exhaustive -- and exhausting," a weary U.S. diplomat said. 
It included a succession of post-midnight sessions as the United States sought 
to broker a deal making clear to Iraq that, as the crisis moved toward 
conflict, the lineup was all against one. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary result sets in motion for the first time the collective 
security that was the dream of the United Nations' architects. That dream lay 
dormant for more than 45 years -- a victim of Cold War tensions only recently 
at an end. 
</P>
<P>
At last, as National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft observed Saturday, the 
Security Council had operated "as it was designed to operate, to mobilize the 
civilized world community against aggression and against aggressors." 
</P>
<P>
"We're really seeing the emergence of a new world order," Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials conceded, however, that the historic moment came at a 
price: watered-down language that left unclear exactly what the Security 
Council had authorized and that may cause the United States to postpone its 
long-threatened use of naval force against defiant Iraqi oil tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Amending a draft that had focused on "minimal force" to secure the blockade, 
the United States reluctantly agreed Friday afternoon to insert a clause 
satisfying a Soviet call for "maximum use of political and diplomatic measures" 
in advance of any resort to military means. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to get around stubborn Chinese antipathy to any mention of the word 
force, the United States at the same time had to agree to a softer phrase: 
"measures commensurate to the specific circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as Friday turned into Saturday, U.S. negotiators had to defer to Third 
World insistence that the resolution make clear that nations would not charge 
off alone but should consult the U.N. secretary general about their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. officials said that to avoid offending its allies, the United 
States will now almost certainly have to wait as many as several days before 
its naval forces challenge an Iraqi vessel in what could lead to shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In their delight at turning the long-moribund United Nations into a powerful 
force, some diplomats even claimed an unintended blessing in the U.S. 
concessions. With U.N. approval now vaguely defined, one official said, the 
United States can claim latitude to take military steps that are more than 
"minimal." 
</P>
<P>
The frictions that emerged in the week of closed-door "consultations" on the 
eighth floor of a New York office building laid bare for the first time 
fractures among nations that had until last week presented a united front in 
opposition to the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
After responding with near-record speed to condemn the Iraqi invasion, to urge 
its withdrawal and to order economic sanctions against the aggressor, the 
Security Council simply stalled when it came time to consider how those U.N. 
sanctions should be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The United States pointed to clear violators: Iraqi oil tankers had ignored 
even warning shots aimed at bringing them to a halt. But in response, the 
Soviet negotiator held steadfastly that it would be premature to authorize 
military force until "diplomatic and political means have been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
In private talks with the United States, France and Britain, the Chinese 
negotiator was making clear that China is "absolutely opposed" to the use of 
force. Confronted with a U.N. Charter that grants a veto to each of the five 
permanent members of the Security Council, some U.S. officials feared that the 
United Nations was doomed to yet another chapter of division and inaction. 
</P>
<P>
What compounded the problem for Pickering was that the Bush Administration made 
clear that it wanted unanimity, or close to it, from the Security Council -- no 
embarrassing "no" votes that could suggest that Iraq had an ally. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, even as China made clear in private assurances to the United States that 
it would not veto the U.S. proposal, Pickering and his staff sought to turn the 
promised abstention into a "yes" vote, and late-night meetings produced little 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial breakthrough came from Moscow, where Gorbachev, besieged by 
diplomatic overtures from the United States, began to soften in his position as 
world outrage mounted over the Iraqi invasion and the taking of hostages by 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets had been wary for a number of reasons about authorizing force, U.S. 
officials said. They noted the awkward presence in Moscow last week of a high 
Iraqi official, concern over the welfare of many Soviet citizens still in Iraq 
at the time, and, more importantly, the longstanding trade, intelligence, 
military and bureaucratic ties with Iraq and other countries in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the officials said, Gorbachev clearly decided that an 
increasingly valuable relationship with the United States was more important 
for the Soviet Union than its fading influence in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In a Friday morning ultimatum to Hussein, he issued what diplomats throughout 
U.N. headquarters in New York immediately saw as a signal that the politically 
savvy Soviet leader had found a way to swing behind the U.S.-sponsored embargo 
enforcement resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called on Hussein to immediately honor U.N. resolutions demanding 
that Iraqis leave Kuwait, restore the ousted government and assure the safety 
of foreigners. "Evading these resolutions will inevitably compel the Security 
Council to adopt appropriate additional measures," Gorbachev said in the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.N. diplomats saw this as a ploy to give the Soviets an excuse to support 
the enforcement resolution: There was little chance Hussein would heed the 
warning, but Gorbachev could say all diplomatic efforts had been tried. And 
Valentin V. Lozinsky, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, candidly 
acknowledged that that was Gorbachev's intent.

S.D. RESERVES AMONG FIRST CALLED TO DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: ABOUT 800 MEDICAL PERSONNEL FROM THROUGHOUT THE WEST WILL REPLACE 
REGULAR-DUTY STAFFERS WHO HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE MIDEAST.

<P>
About 300 San Diego reservists were called to duty Saturday as the secretary of 
the Navy ordered more than 800 medical personnel to report to military 
hospitals from San Diego to Bremerton, Wash., to replace doctors, nurses and 
technicians who have been deployed to bases and medical ships in the tense 
Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The call-ups follow President Bush's decision last Wednesday to authorize the 
use of the so-called "weekend warriors." More than 49,000 armed forces 
reservists are expected to be involved by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy also placed on standby two sophisticated reserve units 
specializing in the electronic surveillance of seaports, as well as four 
sea-lift details. Those units joined three other supply-oriented reserve units 
that were placed on standby Friday. They include a San Diego Army group 
specializing in the supply and purification of water and two National Guard 
trucking units. 
</P>
<P>
The quick activation of medical and supply reservists had been anticipated 
since Wednesday when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney outlined the military's 
immediate needs. But the notification of two Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare 
(MIUW) units represented something of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The MIUW units -- one based in Long Beach, the other in San Francisco -- are 
trained in the operation of sophisticated radio and sonar equipment for the 
monitoring of harbor activity. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in essence a harbor defense unit," said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Gay of the 
Navy's regional reserve headquarters in San Diego. Their mission, he said, is 
to conduct both surface and subsurface surveillance for the protection of 
ports, harbors, anchorages and "offshore economic assets." 
</P>
<P>
"These units are self-supporting and can be rapidly deployed," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear on Saturday where the MIUW units may be deployed if definitive 
orders to activate come. The four sea-lift units put on standby Saturday 
include two in Alameda, one in Santa Barbara and one in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Gay said that about 500 medical reservists had been called up in a Navy reserve 
region that includes Southern California, Arizona and southern Nevada. In 
Northern California, 380 medical reservists had been activated, a Navy 
spokesman in San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, the call-up abruptly disrupted lives, bringing to some a 
welcome new challenge and to others an unwanted detour. 
</P>
<P>
Child-care arrangements were being hastily made. Work left undone at civilian 
jobs was to be left hanging. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this is happening," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Pam Slayton, 
fighting back tears as she clutched her orders at the Naval and Marine Corps 
Reserve Center on Stadium Way north of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton, a 31-year-old corpsman, is to report for duty at Camp Pendleton. Her 
husband, who is on active duty with the Navy, was transferred five days ago 
from Long Beach to Bremerton, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton, who in her civilian life is a computer technician for Southern 
California Gas Co., had been hoping to move to Bremerton -- and switch reserve 
units -- to be with her husband. Now the immediate concern is who will take 
care of their two children, ages 5 and 7. They can't go to Camp Pendleton with 
her Wednesday because she will be in barracks, Slayton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who'll take care of them -- relatives, my mom, somebody," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she joined the reserves several years ago to get benefits while going 
to technical school, adding, "I guess it's time to pay the Navy back." 
</P>
<P>
But Petty Officer 3rd Class Kenneth Pacis, also a corpsman in the same unit as 
Slayton, said he reported to the center Saturday "ready and willing to go." 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Downey resident said he "got kinda nervous when he arrived home 
from a Dodger game Friday night to find a message from a roommate informing him 
that the Navy had called him up." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep too well," he said, "But I calmed down when I learned we were 
not going overseas, at least not for now." 
</P>
<P>
A recent graduate of UCLA, Pacis said he had just last week secured a 
management job but had not yet started. "I guess I'll be letting that job go," 
he said. "When this is over, I'll have to start over." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, reservists from six different units began reporting to the San 
Diego Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Center for duty at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the approximately 300 will see duty at the Navy Hospital in San Diego's 
Balboa Park, where doctors, nurses and others are needed because regular-duty 
staffers have been sent to the Mideast, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Reservists reporting Saturday received an orientation, had their duffel bags 
checked for proper supplies and were given medical exams, ID cards and their 
orders. Then they could go home until reporting to the naval hospital in 
mid-week, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
But not every person in every unit activated in San Diego or elsewhere is being 
called up, Gay said. Rather, the call-up is to fill needs for specific skills. 
</P>
<P>
Naval reservist Frank Drdek, a vice president at Hawthorne Machinery in San 
Diego, noted that his own personnel mobilization specialty would be activated 
only in a general call-up of reserves -- a step he considers unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Vietnam, when we did have a call-up it was still selected reserve 
call-up -- pilots, construction battalion people to do the airstrips, 
intelligence, medical, cargo handlers," Drdek said. "So in this kind of 
situation with Iraq it's going to be even more limited." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors assigned to the Naval Reserve Center in Tustin who were called to 
active duty "really want to go" and "really want to support their country," 
said Lt. Cmdr. M. K. Carlock, commanding officer of the reserve medical unit. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. (Res) Edward H. Bestard, a San Clemente orthopedic surgeon who 
received orders to report to Tustin early Saturday, said he was told the 
hospital there was "almost empty." 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost nobody left, I heard," Bestard said after he completed his 
orders to report to the seaside base on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But the physicians will not report to the hospital until the middle of next 
week. "They don't have to be in the bus tomorrow morning or anything like 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Henk, an AIDS nurse at the UC Davis Medical Center, was among 
the reservists who reported to duty in Sacramento. Henk, who will be assigned 
to Bremerton, had no complaints about going because "I agree with President 
Bush that this is what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
But the 35-year-old Roseville nurse said things will be difficult at home for 
her husband, Robert, a lawyer, and daughters, ages 2 and 5. The 5-year-old 
cried when told her mother was leaving, Henk said, and her husband is a "little 
anxious. He'll have to pay the bills and do all the things I used to do." 
</P>
<P>
At the Treasure Island Naval Station in the Bay Area, the bulk of 13 reserve 
units called to active duty on Saturday will report to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a prank call," said a 40-year-old physician, who got the call 
to report at 4:20 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor, a commander who asked that her name not be used, said her orders 
require that she be on duty for at least 90 days. But she noted that she could 
be called upon to serve much longer. 
</P>
<P>
She had set about referring patients to other doctors and will be giving up her 
civilian salary while she works at Oak Knoll. She said her biggest worry was 
paying the bills. Her husband's salary as a university teacher will not 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to be up front with our mortgage creditor," the doctor 
said. 
</P>

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S ADMIRERS FIGHT TO SAVE HIS PERILED LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: THE FLAMBOYANT INNOVATOR IS APPRECIATED NOW MORE THAN EVER SINCE 
HIS DEATH. BUT SCORES OF HIS DISTINCTIVE BUILDINGS HAVE VANISHED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he has been placed on equal footing with the Greek firm of Ictinus and 
Callicrates that designed the Parthenon, a serious effort is under way to save 
Frank Lloyd Wright's surviving buildings from being knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sinful, sinful," exclaims Jeanette Fields, looking out the window of her 
Wright-designed house in nearby River Forest, Ill., watching a group of 
Japanese tourists who are looking in. 
</P>
<P>
"Tokyo's Imperial Hotel is gone. The Larkin building in Buffalo was torn down 
for no sane reason. Chicago's Midway Gardens went to the wrecker's ball. And 
look what they're doing to the Guggenheim Museum in New York." 
</P>
<P>
The tourists, she says, come by the bus load, beginning as soon as the sun 
comes up. They are Frank Lloyd Wright fans, armed with cameras, maps and 
cassette recorders, hot on the trail of 33 houses and 10 "bootlegs" -- 
moonlighting jobs while working as a draftsman for architect Louis Sullivan -- 
that Wright built between 1889 in 1909 in Oak Park and adjoining River Forest, 
10 miles west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 190l, hers is one of the earliest of Wright's "Prairie School" houses, 
which still draw admirers from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, who admits to being "kicked out of several dinner parties for getting 
very emotional about people selling off Wright windows and woodwork," is a 
director of the recently formed Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy is a consortium of Wright homeowners, curators of Wright house 
museums, architects, and preservationists. It is the latest manifestation of 
growing public concern about preserving the surviving 347 buildings designed by 
Wright in a career that spanned seven decades. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven buildings already have vanished and many others are seriously 
deteriorating. They are under threat from urban sprawl and developers, or prey 
to scavengers in the booming market for Wright artifacts such as art glass 
windows and decorative woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
Preserving what's left is no easy task, concedes Oak Park architect John 
Thorpe, who has had a hand in restoring 21 Frank Lloyd Wright houses. 
</P>
<P>
"If the building is in really decrepit condition, you're going to pay a lot 
more for restoration than you did for the property," he says. "That's why 
cannibalism is so lethal to our efforts. The temptation is to sell off one or 
two windows, which can bring $250,000 or so on the art market, to pay off the 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the people who buy and live in these houses today are not unlike 
the special brand of thinking clients who were the original owners and had 
faith in Wright's off-beat ideas. They know what's different about these 
houses: the natural light, the feeling of shelter, the openness, the sheer 
comfort." 
</P>
<P>
"Restoration takes tact. It's like telling a neighbor to fix up his garage," 
says preservationist Frank Pond, who is active in saving Unity Temple, the 
Unitarian church in Oak Park that was Wright's first public building. 
</P>
<P>
The church, he says, was built for $40,000. "Our restoration surveys cost 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who died 31 years ago at age 91, is far more appreciated and revered 
now than at any time in a flamboyant career. The architect, who never lacked 
self-esteem, was scorned for his having left a wife and six kids to run off 
with a client's wife. Then there was the gory murder of his mistress, two of 
her children and four workmen by a crazed employee. 
</P>
<P>
He was endlessly ducking bill collectors, soothing clients over leaky roofs and 
cost overruns that sometimes ran into the millions. 
</P>
<P>
"Honest arrogance" was Wright's justification for treating clients, critics and 
creditors like unruly children. But the dapper charmer in the porkpie hat, 
flowing tie and opera cape probably never envisioned that 70,000 tourists a 
year would troop through his home and studio in Oak Park, which he started with 
a $5,000 loan and which has just undergone a 12-year, $2.1-million restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"He must be up there chuckling," says Jeanette Fields, who concedes that her 
restoration costs were "many, many times over" the price paid by the original 
owner, E. Arthur Davenport, who worked for the Illinois Central railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The vault of heaven may also echo with chuckles at the recent sale of a Wright 
dining room table and chairs for $1.6 million and Christie's auctioning off one 
of his floor lamps for $704,000 and another lamp, together with an oak music 
cabinet, for $330,000. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 12 Wright houses are now museums, including fabulous 
Fallingwater, perched over that waterfall in Bear Run, Pa.; the Mayer-May house 
in Grand Rapids, Mich., refurbished to its original glory in a 2-year, 
multimillion-dollar restoration, and the Dana-Thomas house in Springfield, 
Ill., undergoing a $4.6-million restoration funded by the Illinois Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, where Wright has had a fanatical following since his first visit in 
1903, an outdoor museum near Nagoya has reproduced in authentic scale the 
facade of his earthquake-proof Imperial Hotel. This daring classic, which he 
"floated" on pilings sunk in the soft mud bottom and "delicately balanced like 
a tray on the fingertips of a waiter," survived the great Tokyo earthquake and 
fire of 1923 but fell to the wrecker's ball in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement has just been reached to reproduce and market Wright's furniture, 
which 20 years ago, according to Chicago preservationist Timothy Barton, "you 
couldn't get the Salvation Army to cart away." 
</P>
<P>
His original drawings are valued in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And what other architect three decades after his death goes on pleasing clients 
with his "office tragedies" -- buildings that for lack of funds or other 
reasons never got built in his lifetime? In recent years, some 15 Wright 
designs have been executed in half a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
"We frequently get inquiries about his blueprints," says architect Charles 
Montooth, who recently erected Wright-designed houses in Ann Arbor and Santa 
Fe. "Interest in Mr. Wright goes in waves, and each time the peak gets a little 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently people didn't realize he designed fabrics and furniture. Now 
galleries and collectors are bidding up his artifacts like Impressionist 
paintings." 
</P>
<P>
Montooth is a fellow at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture and a 
member of Taliesin Associated Architects, the firm that continues his ideas and 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
Architects still operate out of Wright's two former headquarters, Taliesin 
North in Spring Green, Wis., and Taliesin West near Phoenix, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"There are problems building from old plans," says Montooth, leading a guest on 
a tour of Taliesin North's sandstone and native oak buildings that seemed to 
grow out a hillside. "Building codes and client requirements change over the 
years. Costs go up. A house that could be built for $20,000 in the '30s might 
run you a quarter-million now. 
</P>
<P>
"And Mr. Wright kept changing his ideas as he went along. He was like Thomas 
Jefferson at Monticello: From day to day he never saw a project the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Montooth recalls the early days at Taliesin West in Arizona. "It was just a 
glorified tent, but Mr. Wright, in his 70s then, had to have his grand piano. 
He loved grand pianos and fast cars. Mr. Wright believed apprentices should 
learn by building, so we lived in tents while we built in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Yamesee Plantation near Charleston, S.C., which was in deplorable decay, is 
undergoing a multimillion-dollar restoration. In addition outer buildings that 
Wright designed and never saw built are in the overall plan. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor is movie producer Joel Silver, who already lives in a Wright 
house in Hollywood -- Storer House, a Pompeiian villa remarkable for having no 
front door. Wright liked his entrances secluded, mysterious, evoking our 
primitive ancestors finding shelter in a cave. 
</P>
<P>
But in other areas, preservation of the legacy is far from encouraging, reports 
Carla Lind, executive director of the Wright Building Conservancy. She and 
others lament new additions to the Marin County Civic Center north of San 
Francisco and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Under court pressure to relieve overcrowding, Marin County has planned a new 
jail that Wright preservationists say would obstruct the view and destroy the 
ground-hugging grandeur of his quarter-mile-long, pink stucco center that leaps 
over roads and three small hills in graceful arches. Admirers compare it with 
Pont du Gard, the Roman aqueduct in Provence. 
</P>
<P>
Erecting the jail, protested Preserve Our Civic Center, an advocacy group, 
would be "like putting a Taco Bell in front of the Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
Similar anguished cries resulted in some modification of plans to expand the 
Guggenheim, Wright's swirling concrete cone in New York City that has been 
hailed as his East Coast masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Wright fans are still unreconciled by the revised plans. 
</P>
<P>
"They scrapped the first proposal, which was an absolute monstrosity, and came 
up with a second, which is less monstrous," said Roland Reisley, secretary of 
the conservancy. "But from our viewpoint it is a serious loss to the integrity 
of one of the world's most glorious spaces." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career Wright never lost interest in low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has given landmark protection to the partly burned-out and 
deteriorating Waller Apartments, which rented for $12 a month at the turn of 
the century, and to the abused and neglected 1894 Roloson Buildings, his only 
row houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Both would cost more to restore than replace, but they cry out for some 
philanthropic endowment to save them," says Timothy Barton, a preservation 
specialist with the Chicago Landmark Commission. "Some of the windows surfaced 
as recently as two months ago on the art market and are worth more than the 
property." 
</P>
<P>
The encouraging news for Wright fans is that a number of museums now refuse to 
acquire fixtures and furniture scavenged from his surviving buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy director Lind has not given up hope of rescuing the sadly decaying 
A. D. German warehouse, an impressive Mayan-style temple in Richland Center, 
Wis., that Wright created in 1916 for one of his many creditors. Certainly the 
world's most bizarre warehouse, it had room to store coal, grain and feed 
supplies, as well as retail shops, an art gallery and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Richland Center is Wright's birthplace, and it would make an appropriate town 
hall," she says.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIONISTS TOUGHEN DEMANDS ON TWO CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's key environmental political action organization is dangling its 
endorsement before Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson by 
demanding still stronger commitments from the gubernatorial candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The 32,000-member League of Conservation Voters, which describes itself as the 
political arm of the environmental community, also has asked Feinstein and 
Wilson to devote a televised debate to the environment and to further explain 
their positions on a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The candidates will undoubtedly tell you that we ask too much," said Lucy 
Blake, league president. In fact, neither campaign wished to risk offending the 
league publicly. But privately, the organization's new requests elicited 
frustration within both camps. 
</P>
<P>
With opinion polls showing strong interest in environmental protection, the 
league's official support could give either candidate a boost with an important 
bloc of voters. 
</P>
<P>
California voters have never been presented with two major party nominees for 
governor who boast such strong records and campaign positions on the 
environment. But in appearances in opposite ends of the state last week, each 
candidate ran into the potential pitfalls that come with pleasing both 
environmentalists and other potential supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was received with stony silence by state water developers in La Jolla 
on Thursday when she unequivocally opposed any construction that would expedite 
the flow of Northern California water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a Peripheral Canal or through-delta channels, a Feinstein 
Administration would not allow additional water exports to the South until 
strong standards for protection of water quality in the delta and San Francisco 
Bay are established, she told the California Water Resources Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said California could make up a growing, chronic deficit through more 
efficient use of water, the cleanup of polluted aquifers, the encouragement of 
water transfers from farming interests to urban areas, the reclamation of 
treated effluent and the construction of off-stream or underground reservoirs 
for storage of runoff in wet years. 
</P>
<P>
She offered a sweeping vision of a California 50 years from now in which "we 
still have free-flowing rivers . . . we will have new river parkways . . . 
fisheries will have been restored . . . and (Lake) Tahoe will still be blue." 
Farms, homes and industry will operate on the most efficient and modern of 
water supplies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Carl Boronkay of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, 
described Feinstein's rejection of any new delta water transfer facility as "a 
real bomb." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day in Redding, Wilson walked a tightrope between his record as an 
environmentalist and threats to the economy of Northern California in an 
address to Rotary clubs, whose membership includes many timber industry 
officials. Timber interests are outraged over a federal decision that threatens 
to ban tree cutting in vast tracts of national forest land in order to protect 
the habitat of the Northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a biologist," Wilson said. "I have no idea whether the findings are 
sound. There obviously is a need for the kind of balancing" between 
environmental protection and a healthy state economy. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has asked federal officials to study whether the threat to the spotted 
owl may be less serious in California than in Oregon and Washington because of 
differences in geography and climate. If so, Wilson could argue for 
less-extensive forest protection and, perhaps, soothe the timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some timber officials said privately that they wished they could bend Wilson 
more to their view, but there was no public criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The new League of Conservation Voters requests were made Friday as Blake 
released a 12-page statement examining the environmental campaign commitments 
made by Feinstein and Wilson so far. 
</P>
<P>
While the league did not attempt to rank the candidates, an earlier report gave 
Wilson stronger marks on more subjects. But Feinstein has vigorously wooed the 
environmental community by endorsing Proposition 128, the sweeping 
environmental measure that is the league's top priority. She has also promised 
in recent weeks to support most of the environmentalists' agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has declined to back Proposition 128, primarily on the grounds that it 
would establish the statewide elected office of environmental advocate. Because 
of that opposition, most observers believe Wilson has little or no chance of 
getting the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
But Blake said that was not necessarily so. "Literally every option is open," 
Blake said, including the possibility of no endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
The new league assessment credited both candidates with strong positions on 
coastal protection and air quality. However, it called on them to give more 
specific statements on growth management, energy policy, logging and pesticide 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, the league gives Wilson the edge on past records and Feinstein the 
advantage on pledges of actions she would take if elected. Blake said the most 
important factor is a candidate's willingness and ability to stand up to the 
strong interests that profit from the exploitation of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a 24-year record of performance on the environment, a detailed 
platform," said Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dee Myers, Feinstein's press secretary, said the league's report "reflects 
that Dianne's position is obviously more developed in their minds now." She 
said the Feinstein campaign would attempt to answer any further questions the 
league has.

YELTSIN STOKES WAR OF WORDS OVER REPUBLIC;

POLITICS: HE CHALLENGES GORBACHEV'S DECREE ABOUT RUSSIAN RESOURCES. HE 
REAFFIRMS HIS COMMITMENT TO THE HOME-RULE CONCEPT.

Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin took Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev to task Saturday, saying that the Kremlin chief should not interfere 
in the affairs of the country's largest republic. 
</P>
<P>
"I would advise (Gorbachev) not to quarrel with Russia," Yeltsin told reporters 
at an airport on Kamchatka peninsula during his barnstorming trip across the 
vast federation. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's statement challenged a Gorbachev decree that declared Russia's 
resources to be the property of the Soviet Union, the official Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev issued the decree Thursday and confirmed that the Soviet Union would 
honor its export agreements, including a recent deal with the Swiss subsidiary 
of De Beers, the South African diamond merchant, to market Soviet diamonds over 
the next five years in return for a $1-billion loan in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation earlier threatened to annul deals such as the diamond 
accord unless they were approved by the Russian Parliament, and Yeltsin 
reaffirmed that home-rule concept as he toured the Soviet Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"The president's decree does not concern the Russian Supreme Soviet decision," 
Yeltsin said, according to Tass. "He does not have such a right." 
</P>
<P>
The war of words between Gorbachev and Yeltsin over who owns Russia's wealth of 
diamonds, gold, oil and other natural resources is part of a greater battle for 
power between the two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It also symbolizes the growing conflict between "the center," as people call 
the national government in Moscow, and the 15 constituent republics over the 
control of everything from borders to vegetable crops. The Presidium of the 
Russian Federation also published a report Saturday calling the Gorbachev 
decree invalid. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation assumed control over all its mineral and other natural 
riches under a sovereignty declaration issued in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidium's report said actions contrary to the economic interests of 
Russia, such as deals made by the Kremlin to sell Russia's riches, should be 
governed by Russian laws until a new federal treaty is signed between the 
constituent Soviet republics.

Siberians angered by shortages of liquor and cigarettes smashed cars and shop 
windows, tossed firebombs and tried to storm police headquarters in the 
country's most violent disturbance triggered by the disintegrating Soviet 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were detained and dozens were injured in three days of 
riots ending early Saturday that shook Chelyabinsk, a large industrial city 
1,200 miles east of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising was another indication of the Soviet people's frustration over 
their government's inability to provide them with the consumer goods they want 
and need. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 1,500 people, many of them reportedly drunken youths, gathered 
Friday night near a local government building and made their way through the 
city, tossing Molotov cocktails and smashing several cars and an ambulance on 
the way to the regional Communist Party headquarters, the official Tass news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police attempted to block the protesters, but a group of city officials, 
including Chelyabinsk's deputy mayor, demanded that the march continue, saying 
they would be responsible for the crowd's actions. 
</P>
<P>
At midnight, the crowd held a rally at the party headquarters, demanding better 
food and other consumer goods. When party officials tried to talk to the crowd, 
they were silenced with insults and curses shouted at them through bullhorns. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded the release of rioters who were detained during 
disturbances the previous night and attempted to storm the Interior Ministry 
building where their comrades presumably were being held, but they were 
repulsed by police. 
</P>
<P>
Rioters smashed windows as the crowd dispersed at about 1 a.m. Saturday, Tass 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The latest rampage in the city of more than 1 million people on the eastern 
slopes of the Ural mountains followed two days of similar outbursts. On 
Wednesday, angry consumers lined up for alcohol at the largest supermarket in 
Chelyabinsk went on a rampage, shouting "Give us sausage, give us sugar, give 
us tobacco!" when sales clerks refused to open the doors without police to 
maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen policemen were wounded and 13 police cars damaged in the ensuing 
violence, and 138 people were detained, Tass reported. "Drunken youths armed 
with sticks and stones broke bus windows," the news agency said, and police 
moved in with rubber truncheons to club and disperse rioters. 
</P>
<P>
A similar protest, attracting about 400 people, broke out the next evening, the 
Interfax news service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Valery P. Pustovoi, chief of the city interior ministry, said by telephone 
Saturday that Chelyabinsk became calm after the mayor appealed for order in a 
televised speech. 
</P>
<P>
Similar disturbances, but on a smaller scale, have been sparked by shortages of 
cigarettes and other consumer goods in many cities across the Soviet Union this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
In another demonstration, hundreds of taxi drivers drove in caravan through 
Moscow's streets Saturday honking horns in protest over an attack at a main 
Moscow taxi depot Friday night that left one driver dead. Tass reported that 25 
men arrived at the depot in cars without license plates and attacked drivers 
with knives and guns. 
</P>
<P>
The country's leaders are frantically preparing a plan to transform the 
sluggish economy into a market system based on supply and demand. But as the 
Chelyabinsk riots show, many Soviet consumers are fed up with promises of a 
better future and demand cigarettes, vodka and sausage now.

13 KILLED, 200,000 FLEE HOMES AS STORM LASHES AT PHILIPPINES

At least 13 people died and 200,000 fled to safer ground during floods and 
heavy rains spawned by a tropical storm in the capital and surrounding 
provinces, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Manila Weather Bureau officials said the storm late Saturday was located 345 
miles east of Aparri on the northern tip of the main Luzon island, with peak 
winds of 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The military Office of Civil Defense said 13 people were killed by flooding in 
the capital, either by drowning or being pinned by a wall that collapsed at the 
height of the rains. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Department said more than 200,000 people in the capital and 
in the rice-producing provinces of Tarlac and Bulacan, north of Manila, sought 
refuge in evacuation centers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the evacuees were from metropolitan Manila slum districts, relief 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said the storm unleashed heavy rains that combined with 
high tide in the afternoon to create one of the worst floods in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of commuters were stranded and hundreds of workers and students slept 
in their offices and schools as transport drivers refused to ply flooded 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, suspected rebel soldiers seeking to overthrow President Corazon 
Aquino exploded a bomb at a Toyota sales office in the capital's financial 
district, damaging six cars but causing no injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast was the 11th in the capital since rebel soldiers announced Aug. 15 
that they would resume hostilities after Aquino rejected their call for a 
cease-fire in the face of the devastating July 16 earthquake and the Persian 
Gulf crisis.

SAVE BOGS BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE, IRISH TOLD

Conservationists are ringing alarm bells for the bogs of Ireland before, they 
say, 10,000 years of history are destroyed forever. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be nothing left by the year 2000 if we don't do something now," 
said Peter Foss of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, which is fighting 
to stop the bogs from vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
The rolling red-brown boglands that are such a unique feature of Ireland are 
being eaten away by forestation, mechanical peat turf-cutting and drainage. As 
a result, an Eden for plants, insects and birds is rapidly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress has reached that stage when even the traditional turf cutter and his 
donkey laden with peat may soon vanish from the Irish rural landscape -- to be 
replaced by a fume-belching mechanical digger," Foss said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrial peat-cutting leaves a vast brown desert. The whole thing is 
destroyed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are cutting away our birthright. If we destroy our environment, people are 
not going to come here. Tourism is our second-biggest industry after 
agriculture. We do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
Peat is used to keep the home fires of Ireland burning, to fuel electricity 
generators and to improve garden soil. 
</P>
<P>
Bord na Mona, Ireland's state-run turf board, which sells about 4 million tons 
of peat a year, scoffs at critics who say it is plundering a nation's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else works the land of Ireland on a 50-year time-scale like we do and 
supplies indigenous energy and employment in remote rural areas," a board 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would regard the bogs of Ireland as a valuable ecological asset, but they 
also have social and financial value." 
</P>
<P>
Peatlands once covered more than 2.5 million acres, or 17% of the land surface 
of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"Today less than half of the original peatland area remains in a relatively 
intact condition," Foss said. Ecologists are targeting just 4% of the remaining 
land, which they say merits conservation. 
</P>
<P>
International pressure has gone a long way in helping to galvanize Irish public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, who realized too late that they were plundering an irreplaceable 
ecological asset, have been leading lights in a campaign to save Irish bogs now 
that their own have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch environmentalists raised $300,000 to buy four prime Irish bog sites as 
nature reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Ireland can still avoid making the same mistakes, but only if the right 
decisions are made now," said Matthijs Schouten, chairman of the Dutch 
Foundation for the Conservation of Irish Bogs. 
</P>
<P>
British naturalist David Bellamy campaigned long and hard for the preservation 
of Clara Bog in central Ireland, now rescued from its fate as fuel for a power 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist authorities organize trips to Clara for enthusiasts who say a day 
hiking on squishy bogs is the nearest thing to walking on water. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like being on a giant water bed. There is more solid material in milk 
than there is in peat," Foss explained. 
</P>
<P>
"When you step out onto the bog, you are entering one of the last great 
wilderness areas of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Poet Seamus Heaney described the ground as "black butter, melting and opening 
underfoot." 
</P>
<P>
Clara is now recognized as a natural heritage site of international importance, 
a rolling wilderness that is home to ferns and frogs, skylarks and slugs, 
mushrooms and mosses. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way to build a Peatland Museum in Clara that could match in 
popularity its equivalent counterpart in the Netherlands, which attracts up to 
1.5 million visitors a year.

ISRAELI BORDERS WITH SYRIA, JORDAN QUIET; 
</P>
<P>
REASSURANCE: A TOUR OF ISRAEL'S EASTERN FRONTIER FINDS NO SIGN OF MILITARY 
ACTIVITY. 'THINGS ARE AS QUIET AS ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY,' AN OFFICER SAYS.

GOLAN HEIGHTS, Israeli-Occupied Territories

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All is quiet on Israel's eastern front. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. Huge Merkava (Chariot) tanks of the crack 7th Armored Brigade 
fired their main guns with echoing explosions as the vehicles maneuvered in an 
easterly direction toward the Syrian border. 
</P>
<P>
But it was only a training exercise by the armored unit that once faced the 
entire Syrian tank onslaught during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and staved off 
invasion. Otherwise, the Israeli border with Syria from Mt. Hermon, and with 
Jordan from the Yarmuk River in the north to Eilat and Aqaba on an arm of the 
Red Sea, was silent -- despite the tension created by the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
A two-day journey along that border, which lies along the Great Rift Valley, 
found Israeli patrols to be moving and watchful, but there was absolutely no 
sign of significant activity by Syrian and Jordanian military units. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are as quiet as any time in our history," a reserve officer said as he 
stood atop a bombed-out hospital and surveyed the ruined city of Kuneitra, the 
former capital of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 and returned to 
Syria after the 1973 War. 
</P>
<P>
The only vehicles moving were the white trucks of the United Nations, which 
maintains a truce-observation force along the eastern border of the Golan 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the maneuvers of the 7th Armored Brigade, the main sign of activity 
was the pruning of the new vineyards that have been planted in the volcanic 
soil of the Golan plateau and the tending of grazing herds of beef cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, the gulf crisis has reinforced the calm here," said the retired 
officer. "Syria is sending troops to Saudi Arabia to face their No. 1 Arab 
enemy -- Iraq. The last thing they want is trouble with us." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the only figures moving along the east side of the Jordan River were 
farmers tending the lush green patches of grain and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Every evening, Israeli border patrols rake the unpaved gravel road next to the 
electronic double fence that twists and winds, following the trickle of the 
Jordan river. 
</P>
<P>
And every morning, specially trained trackers examine the road for signs of 
infiltration. 
</P>
<P>
On rare occasions they find footsteps, as they did a week ago, when they 
quickly disposed of the intruders in Jordanian army uniforms, killing one and 
wounding the other. 
</P>
<P>
But these border-crossers were believed to be free-lance operators who did not 
represent any official patrol of the Jordan army. That army is not even based 
in the Jordan valley but in the hills and plains well to the east. 
</P>
<P>
And from the Dead Sea all the way down the Wadi Araba to the Gulf of Aqaba, 
there is no security fence along the border, which is demarcated only by the 
deepest depression contour line in the below-sea-level desert valley. 
</P>
<P>
"King Hussein is more worried about Saddam Hussein and what the Iraqi army may 
do than about Israel these days," a senior military source observed. "We have 
given him the word that any move in our direction may cost him his kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
The calm of the Jordan valley and, more importantly, the Golan Heights, is 
soothing to Israeli military planners who, since the peace with Egypt was 
signed, have considered Syria with its powerful armed forces to be the chief 
threat to Israel's physical security. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, sharing no common border with Israel, was viewed as a lesser threat. 
</P>
<P>
But now Syria and Israel have a common interest in seeing -- and seeking -- the 
downfall of the Baghdad strongman, a curious state of affairs, providing still 
another political irony in the shifting sands of Middle East relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria realizes that if Iraq emerges victorious or unscathed from this crisis, 
it will have repercussions on Syrian security," commented Prof. Itamar 
Rabinovich, rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert on Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Rabinovich noted that Syrian President Hafez Assad views the support 
for Iraq by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
as vindicating Syria's hostility to that group. 
</P>
<P>
But Yossi Olmert, chief government spokesman and former professor of Arab 
affairs, said it is incorrect to assume that Syria will adopt a more congenial 
policy toward Israel simply because of both countries' anti-Iraq attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Some Middle East analysts hopefully suggest that in taking the same side in the 
gulf crisis, Syria and Israel might plant the seeds for some kind of eventual 
compromise between Jersualem and Damascus, with Israel relinquishing part of 
the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
But Syria still insists on the return of the whole Golan plateau up to the 
escarpment overlooking northern Galilee. And it is unclear whether Assad would 
agree to demilitarizing the area, even if Israel would give it back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that we shouldn't expect any change in Syrian policy toward Israel 
in the future, simply because of the gulf crisis," said Olmert. 
</P>
<P>
And that is why the massive Merkava tanks conduct regular shooting exercises on 
the Golan Heights -- determined not to be caught with their guard down, as they 
were during the first grim October days of the 1973 War.

GULF WATCH: DAY 24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A daily briefing paper on developments in the crisis: 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar invited Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to participate in emergency talks to resolve the 
crisis in the Persian Gulf. He said the talks could begin as soon as Monday in 
New York or Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush scored a diplomatic coup with approval by the U.N. Security 
Council of a resolution authorizing military action to enforce the 
international trade sanctions against Iraq. The vote was 13 to 0, with Yemen 
and Cuba abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
The lights went out and the water was cut off at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, 
but Iraq's ambassador in Washington said his government would not use force to 
oust Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and the other diplomats who defied the 
order to close the compound. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq promised to free about 60 wives and dependents of U.S. diplomats who left 
the U.S. Embassy before Friday's deadline. But it continued to hold the 30 or 
so male embassy personnel who evacuated with their families to Baghdad 
expecting to be given safe passage to Turkey. At least 20 other countries 
refused to close their embassies in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: Pentagon sources said the United States was not likely to begin 
firing at ships that attempt to evade the blockade until today at the earliest. 
They indicated that the delay reflects logistic considerations, not a lack of 
resolve to enforce the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Units of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Lakenheath in Britain were 
deployed to support the military buildup in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: The international embargo appears to be taking hold in Iraq. There 
were reports from Baghdad of panic buying, efforts to create a national 
rationing system and house-to-house searches for food stockpiles by armed 
militiarymen. 
</P>
<P>
A divided OPEC will meet today in Vienna to consider possible production 
increases to offset the loss of about 4 million barrels a day of crude oil 
exports from Iraq and Kuwait. Insiders say the 13-member cartel is far from 
united on the issue.

CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT BUSH'S TROOP DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: A MAJORITY, HOWEVER, ALSO SAID IT IS LIKELY THAT THE U.S. COULD GET 
BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER VIETNAM.

<P>
Californians strongly support President Bush's decision to send American 
fighting forces to the Persian Gulf, but many also think the United States 
could become "bogged down in another Vietnam," The Los Angeles Times Poll 
found. 
</P>
<P>
And although there is concern throughout the state that the Middle East crisis 
could lead to a gasoline shortage, Californians still oppose drilling for oil 
off their coast, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
People seem to have little trouble fixing blame for the big rise in gasoline 
prices: It's not the fault of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime, but the oil 
industry, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,586 registered voters 
throughout California during six days ending Wednesday night. The margin of 
error is 3 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
The poll's findings indicated that while Californians support the idea of 
standing up to Saddam Hussein, they realize that it involves risks to American 
lives and possibly to their own lifestyles. So far, they are willing to take 
those risks. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of those surveyed approved of "sending American troops to the 
Persian Gulf to defend Saudi Arabia" against a potential Iraqi attack -- and 
roughly half "strongly" approved. Men and Republicans especially supported the 
military deployment -- more than 8 in 10 did -- but so did two-thirds of women 
and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
However, a majority -- 52% -- also said it is "likely" that the United States 
could get bogged down in another Vietnam situation. Democrats and women 
particularly feared this. 
</P>
<P>
Also, nearly two-thirds of the voters said they are "concerned" that the crisis 
will result in an oil shortage. 
</P>
<P>
But when voters were asked whether they now would approve of offshore drilling 
to "help the United States be less dependent on Arab oil supplies," or whether 
they opposed drilling "because it spoils the scenic beauty of California and 
risks oil spills that might damage the environment," only 37% favored drilling 
and 57% were opposed. The remainder of those surveyed weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
This represented only a slight softening of anti-drilling sentiment since last 
February, when a similar Times poll found 32% in favor and 60% opposed. Later, 
Bush banned most new drilling off the California coast for the rest of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Many people interviewed in this survey fretted about the economic impact of the 
Middle East crisis. Roughly 6 in 10 said they are "worried" that it "could help 
bring on a recession in California." 
</P>
<P>
But a virtually equal number also were worried that long-planned defense 
spending cuts could lead to a recession in the state. Roughly one in five of 
those interviewed said somebody in their family is employed by a firm that has 
military contracts. And of these people with families dependent to some degree 
on defense spending, more than a third said the affected employee faces either 
a layoff or reduction in work hours because of military cutbacks. 
</P>

<P>
A British couple trapped in Iraq wanted a simple blue-jean wedding. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi authorities insisted that the Persian Gulf crisis should not prevent 
the betrothed from a more traditional Western wedding, including a champagne 
toast, a wedding cake and a white bridal gown. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony was even broadcast on Baghdad television Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to get married while here. . . . We are happy anyway," 
Deborah, the bride, shouted over Western music blaring from loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast showed Robert (no second name given) in a dark suit kissing 
Deborah Janes in a white gown to the tunes of an Iraqi musical band and a 
children's choir. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 Iraqi "guests" and fellow British hostages wished the couple a happy 
life thereafter.

IRAQ REVIVING ATOMIC ARMS, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: IT ALSO TURNS OUT MORE THAN 1,000 TONS OF POISON GAS A YEAR, U.S. 
RESEARCHERS FIND.

<P>
Iraq not only has become a major poison gas producer but also has revived 
efforts to make atomic weapons, plans that were earlier thwarted by Israel's 
1981 bombing of a nuclear reactor, a report said. 
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein's government each year turns out more than 1,000 tons 
of chemical warfare agents, including blister-causing mustard gas and nerve 
gas, according to "Sword of the Arabs," a survey of Iraqi weaponry soon to be 
issued by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a private research 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Sustained production at that level would give Iraq the world's largest chemical 
weapons stockpile if the United States and Soviet Union carry out obligations 
of a treaty they signed last June to reduce their stocks to 5,000 tons by the 
year 2002. Current U.S. stockpiles are estimated at 30,000 tons, while the 
Soviets have an estimated 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has an active program to make germ weapons even though it has signed 
but not ratified a 1972 treaty prohibiting development or possession of 
biological weapons, said the report, obtained by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
After Israel bombed Iraq's Osiraq reactor in 1981, the Iraqi nuclear weapons 
project remained dormant until 1987, when Baghdad turned to the gas centrifuge 
method of enriching uranium fuel, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
This method could provide the ability to produce nuclear weapons in 5 to 10 
years depending on the amount of equipment and technology Iraq continues to 
draw from abroad, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Long before that, however, Iraq could make one or two small, low-yield atomic 
bombs using 12.5 kilograms (27.5 pounds) of French-supplied uranium in its 
possession, said Michael Eisenstadt, author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
That uranium, however, is subject to international inspection, and its 
diversion to weapons would be a formal breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
signed by Iraq, provoking international censure. Eisenstadt said Iraq is 
unlikely at this time to make the smaller bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The gas centrifuge method, used by Pakistan and Brazil, is easy to disperse and 
conceal and "might enable Iraq to clandestinely develop a nuclear weapons 
production capability while formally preserving its credentials as a signatory 
of the (treaty)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenstadt predicted that Iraq will stockpile chemical "and possibly biological 
weapons for the foreseeable future," and he said that Iraq in the near future 
is expected to produce chemical missile warheads, "vastly increasing the 
lethality of its strategic forces." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Soviet, Chinese, West German, Austrian, Italian, Argentine, 
Egyptian and Swiss technology was used in Iraqi missile development. 
</P>
<P>
Development of strike systems capable of reaching Israel "has led to the 
emergence of an uneasy deterrent relationship between Iraq and Israel," he 
said. "Israel now has to consider that a preventive strike against Iraq could 
prompt retaliation and produce unacceptable losses. Iraq's strategic deterrent 
thus produces a protective umbrella for its nuclear weapons program."

GATORADE CALLED TO QUENCH SOLDIERS' DESERT-SIZE THIRST

<P>
It started out as just another hot, lazy summer and workers at the Quaker Oats 
plant figured the Gatorade they were making was for weekend warriors on tennis 
courts and softball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Now that it's quenching the thirst of full-time soldiers in the Middle East, 
work doesn't seem so dull anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of gallons of the drink produced at the Newport plant are bound for 
the Persian Gulf, and more is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"This started about two weeks ago when we received a rush order for two 
truckloads of 12-ounce Gatorade," plant manager Bill Wolford said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Through some overtime effort, the plant got the order of about 500,000 quart 
bottles completed in time for delivery to Camp LeJeune, N. C., and an airlift 
to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the plant has delivered about 23,000 cases of the beverage to 
Charleston, S. C., where it was loaded onto container ships headed to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is working on another order of 20,000 cases of liquid Gatorade for 
the military and is expecting potentially larger orders for the drink in 
powdered form. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport, a town of 8,000, there's a sense of mission at the 600-employee 
Quaker Oats plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The folks here at the plant are very much aware of where this product is going 
and we are keeping them abreast," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have several employees in the plant that have children in the armed service 
and also in the reserves," general supervisor Thom Pasinger said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small town, so everybody knows where the shipments are going," said 
warehouse manager Mel Wadlinger said. "The guys in the warehouse are proud. 
We've got a lot of veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Gatorade was developed for athletes in the 1960s to prevent dehydration and 
heat illnesses. It didn't get its first taste of military action until recently 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The military's demand isn't expected to cause a shortage of the product in the 
domestic market, said Peter Vitulli, president of Quaker's grocery specialties 
division, at corporate headquarters in Chicago.

IRAQ RATIONING, PANIC BUYING, SEARCHES TOLD

Reports filtering out of Baghdad tell of panic buying, rationing and 
house-to-house sweeps by militiamen hunting food hoarders as Iraq begins to 
feel the bite of the U.N. trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council approved military action to enforce the 
embargo imposed Aug. 6 to punish Saddam Hussein for invading and annexing 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
It could be weeks before Iraqis really have to tighten their belts. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the sanctions were given sharper teeth, reports out of Iraq 
said essentials such as cooking oil, flour and fruit have virtually disappeared 
in the capital city of Baghdad and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Armed units of the ruling Baath Party's militia, the People's Guard, were 
conducting random checks of stores and homes, looking in freezers and cupboards 
for surplus stocks, the dissident Kurdish Democratic Party said in a statement 
released in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
The reports were confirmed by sources in Baghdad, where about a quarter of 
Iraq's 17 million people live. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 12, when Saddam told the nation to prepare for austerity, hoarding 
food and profiteering have been punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three days, government agents have been conducting a census in 
Baghdad to prepare for national rationing based on the number of people in each 
family, according to sources who spoke on condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Militiamen and soldiers patrolled Baghdad's streets to disperse crowds of more 
than five people, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Government ministers and the official media have been asking people to reduce 
their consumption of some foods, while assuring them that Iraq has sufficient 
stockpiles to last months, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Exiled Iraqis and experts have varied opinions about how much food Iraq has on 
hand and how long it will last. The only certainty is that the country requires 
imported food bought with oil revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iraq spent $2.9 billion importing 75% of what its people ate. 
</P>
<P>
With oil exports, Iraq's main source of revenue, now largely cut off, the 
country faces a harsh winter if it does not withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the oil embargo," said Selim Fakhri, a former 
colonel in the Iraqi army and a leading figure in the resistance alliance in 
exile. 
</P>
<P>
"Food is still coming in through Jordan, perhaps Yemen and Lebanon. But if Iraq 
can't sell its oil, then there will come a time when the country will not be 
able to pay for anything, even if it can bring it in. 
</P>
<P>
"Without oil, the country grinds to a halt. I give it no more than a couple of 
months," he said in a telephone interview from London.

SHOT IN MOUTH, MAN CREDITS LIFE TO DENTURES

A man shot in the mouth credits his survival to a sturdy pair of dentures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm alive today because of my false teeth," said Charles Alexander Hinkle, 38, 
showing his shattered dentures to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Hinkle was shot last week by a woman whose angry boyfriend coaxed her into 
pulling the trigger, said sheriff's Capt. Richard Cipriano. The bullet pierced 
the windshield of Hinkle's car, tore through his upper lip and smashed into the 
gum portion of his dentures. 
</P>
<P>
"I spit out the bullet," Hinkle said. "I put my head down below the dashboard 
and drove to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Lee Howard, 34, and her boyfriend, Robert L. Schermerhorn, 58, were 
arrested and charged with attempted murder, Cipriano said. 
</P>
<P>
The three had been drinking together at a bar, Hinkle said. Schermerhorn left 
early, and Howard asked Hinkle to drive her home. When they arrived, 
Schermerhorn allegedly demanded that Howard shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the last time I'll be Mr. Nice Guy," Hinkle said.

UNDERSEA TUNNEL HAS 2 SAFETY STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TAPPI STATION, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tappi station's waiting room is huge, but no one starts a trip there. It 
provides a way out if something goes wrong under the Tsugaru Straits in the 
world's longest tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Five trains stop at Tappi each day and let hundreds of people off for a look, 
by guided tour, at conditions 450 feet beneath the surface. The passengers then 
board the next train to finish the journey between Hokkaido, Japan's 
northernmost main island, and the central island of Honshu. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Tappi and Yoshioka, a similar station near the other end of the 
Seikan Tunnel, is to provide shelter or an exit in case of earthquakes or other 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
At 50 m.p.h., a train takes 40 minutes to complete the trip through the tunnel, 
an $8.5-billion tube 34 miles long that runs under the Tsugaru Straits for 
nearly 15 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"Down that way, you can walk to the other side," a guide said, pointing down a 
side tunnel. "It would take about six hours." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Seikan opened in March, 1988, rail passengers transferred to a ferry 
for a 4-hour voyage across the straits between Aomori, on Honshu, and Hakodate, 
on Hokkaido. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the service was halted by storms. A typhoon sank a ferry in 1954, 
killing more than 1,100 people, and support for a tunnel grew. 
</P>
<P>
Guides from Japan Railways show visitors to Tappi and Yoshioka some of the ways 
of coping with emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Each station is under land. The tunnel does not emerge from the ground for 8 
1/2 miles beyond Tappi, and 10 1/2 miles past Yoshioka, but stranded passengers 
can take a cable car or stairway to the surface. It is 1,316 steps to the top 
from Tappi, about a 20-minute climb. 
</P>
<P>
Both stations are in the service tunnels, which are big enough for a truck to 
drive through and run along both sides of the 36-foot-wide main railway tube. 
</P>
<P>
Air pressure in the service tunnels is higher than in the main tunnel so smoke 
from a fire cannot enter them. The main tunnel has sprinkler and drainage 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Tappi and Yoshioka have restrooms, first-aid stations and benches for hundreds 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
Sensors and television cameras monitor conditions inside the tunnel. A 
television monitor in Tappi, using remote-controlled cameras, gives a sweeping 
view of conditions on the surface similar to that of a submarine periscope. 
</P>
<P>
When there is no emergency, passengers can stop at Tappi to walk in the service 
tunnels, buy soft drinks from a machine or purchase a small souvenir tunnel 
"passport" whose price of 1,000 yen ($6.70) includes a card good for that value 
in travel on Japan Railways. 
</P>
<P>
At its center, the tunnel is 785 feet below the water's surface and 330 feet 
under the seabed. To keep water from seeping in under high pressure, the earth 
around the tunnel has been reinforced for a distance of up to 65 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Excavation began in 1971, with the cost estimated at about one-third the final 
total. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel required 13.8 million man-days of work and took the lives of 34 
workers. Four serious cases of flooding delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
Techniques developed in the project are expected to help in construction of the 
31-mile tunnel under the English Channel that will link England and France. 
</P>
<P>
Seikan completes the ground linkage of Japan's four main islands. The 2.3-mile 
Kanmon Tunnel between Honshu and the southern island of Kyushu was completed in 
1942, and in April, 1988 the 7.7-mile Seto Ohashi Bridge opened between Honshu 
and Shikoku, east of Kyushu.

ANCIENT INDIAN SITE FOUND IN COLORADO

<TEXT>
<P>
Two college students have stumbled upon the virtually untouched ruins of a 
1,100-year-old Anasazi Indian village in southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The six-acre Mountain Sheep Village, the name given the site, probably had 
about 200 structures and may have housed 150 to 200 Indians as early as AD 850, 
said Kristie Arrington, an archeologist for the Bureau of Land Management, the 
agency that controls the discovery site. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery is significant because the site is on the north side of the 
Dolores River, which wraps around it on three sides. Previously, Anasazi ruins 
have been found only south of the river. 
</P>
<P>
The Anasazi, or "Ancient Ones," lived in the Four Corners area. Their 
best-known ruins are the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde National Park in 
southwestern Colorado. The site discovered earlier this month by the University 
of Colorado students is about 60 miles northwest of Mesa Verde, not far from 
the Utah border. 
</P>
<P>
Pottery fragments recovered at the site date it about 300 years before the 
height of Mesa Verde cliff dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Arrington said the people of Mountain Sheep Village may have traded big game 
and timber with other villages in exchange for food and pottery. She said tools 
associated with game procurement and processing, such as arrowheads, scrapers 
and knives, have been found on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Students Dave Merritt and Chris Kuzawa, working out of the Dolores Canyon 
Research Center on a federal archeology project, discovered the site. The 
project involves tracking desert bighorn sheep and river otters, conducting an 
inventory of water invertebrates in the river and probing historic mining 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The two were tracking bighorn sheep with another student, Patricia Dahnke, when 
they discovered the ruins.

VICTORY TAKEN AWAY, SOME AFGHANS SAY

<P>
Afghan refugees are increasingly blaming Muslim guerrillas they once hailed as 
heroes for the 12-year-old civil war that keeps them from going home. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no peace because these people are not united," said a refugee named 
Feramoz, referring to the seven guerrilla groups that received support from the 
United States, Saudi Arabia and other sympathetic Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
While the superpowers seek a compromise in the Afghan war, resentment is 
growing among refugees over the lethal infighting among the guerrilla groups 
and the opulent lifestyles of their leaders in Peshawar, near the Afghan 
border. 
</P>
<P>
A two-day summit between U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze -- whose government continues to back 
Afghan President Najibullah after the Soviet pullout in February last year -- 
ended Thursday with little indication of progress on Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
That lowered expectations of a quick settlement that could allow the 
repatriation of an estimated 3.8 million Afghans who live in dried-mud huts and 
weather-worn tents in refugee camps across Pakistan's rugged Northwest Frontier 
Province. 
</P>
<P>
"We're forced to live like this. What can we do?" asked Feramoz, who uses only 
one name. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla leaders are rumored to have made fortunes during the long war, 
siphoning off weapons, money and supplies earmarked for the war effort and 
using the proceeds to build colonial-style homes and buy four-wheel-drive 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in late July launched a cash-and-food program for refugees 
who agree to return to Afghanistan, but few have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees say Islamic clerics have been issuing threats from mosques and 
condemning those who return to Afghanistan as infidels. There have also been 
reports of guerrilla leaders forcing returning refugees back to the camps. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who wanted to go back are being stopped at the border by moujahedeen 
(Islamic holy warriors)," said Sadar Gul, an Islamic cleric who preaches in the 
Nasir Baugh camp dominated by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-i-Islami, or Party of 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen leaders, once lionized, are now seen by many as bickering 
warlords who have lost the faith of their backers and the support of most of 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been cheated of our victory," said Aga Shah, a young Afghan who longed 
for the days when Soviet soldiers were fighting alongside Kabul's 
communist-style government -- because the presence of a foreign force brought 
unity to the armed opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Russians were there we were happy because all Muslims were united," 
he said. "Now they are all fighting for power." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow withdrew its combat troops in February, 1989, after nine years of direct 
military involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's just Afghans killing Afghans," said Hamed Gailani, whose father heads 
a pro-royalist National Islamic Front of Afghanistan guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas' government-in-exile, once seen as a replacement to President 
Najibullah, has tested Washington's patience -- some say to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Senate intelligence committee has voted to slash $100 million from its 
military allotment to the guerrilla fighters who last year reportedly received 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has agreed that Najibullah, the Soviet-installed leader, can remain 
president providing he cedes power over his military, secret police and state 
media. 
</P>
<P>
Gailani said the only solution to peace is the return of Afghanistan's former 
monarch, Mohammed Zahir Shah, who was overthrown by his cousin Mohammed Daoud 
in 1973. Zahir Shah has been living in exile in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
But Islamic radicals within the rebel leadership condemn the former king, 
saying he opened Afghanistan's door to communism and then remained silent 
throughout the war.

SAND BAR WAS ONCE A GLORIOUS ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At low tide, a sand bar peeks out from under the ocean at the mouth of New 
Jersey's Great Bay, the last remnant of an American Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Suter recalls when that sand bar was a magnificent island, a dreamy sort 
of a place with families and beautiful cedar trees and tales of haunted hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Suter, who turns 83 this month, was one of the children who told those ghost 
stories on Tucker's Island. 
</P>
<P>
And she may be the last person alive who can tell from personal experience the 
story of the island, which was swallowed by the sea more than half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story with a lesson, a reminder that man may live on the Earth and even 
manipulate it, but, in the end, does not control it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful place," Suter said of her childhood home. "But now it's 
gone to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
In its glory years, as far back as the late 1700s, Tucker's Island was 5 miles 
long and a mile wide. It boasted a lighthouse, two hotels and a school and was 
a popular spot for sportsmen and vacationers from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The island, north of Atlantic City along the New Jersey coast, was named for 
Rueben Tucker, a Quaker from New York who bought it in 1765. According to John 
Bailey Lloyd, a historian who has written about the lost island in two books, 
wealthy Quakers gathered there for religious retreats in the years following 
the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The island was renamed Sea Haven in the 1870s, when there were plans to develop 
it into a major resort. Those plans were shelved when the nearby town of Beach 
Haven, on another island a few miles to the north, proved to be too much 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Haven's fate as a commercial enterprise was sealed in 1886, when the 
Pennsylvania Railroad ran a line across Barnegat Bay onto Long Beach Island, 
Lloyd said. The tracks ended at Beach Haven and were never extended. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913, when Suter arrived at age 7, the only residents of the once-bustling 
island were a lighthouse keeper, the staff of a lifesaving station and their 
families. The Columbia and St. Alban's hotels had long since closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember these two big hotels in disrepair," Suter said. "We kids would say 
they were haunted." 
</P>
<P>
During her first winter there, she lived in a bungalow with her mother and 
father, who worked at the lifesaving station, rescuing shipwrecked sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The family spent a second winter on the island in a houseboat that Suter's 
father towed across the bay from Parkertown. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed there from September to June," Suter said. "We didn't stay in the 
summer, because there weren't that many shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Suter recalls attending a one-room schoolhouse on the island in 1913 and 1914, 
with about six other children. She has fond memories of walking the desolate 
beaches with her mother, and going fishing in her father's garvey, a small 
scow. 
</P>
<P>
On blustery winter nights, everyone would gather at the lifesaving station, the 
center of the island's social life. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a gramophone and people would sing and dance," she said. "Nowadays, 
people get bored if they don't have a television set. But we had wonderful 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Those times ended in 1915, when the lifesaving station was disbanded and the 
Coast Guard took over Tucker's Island. The family moved back to its house 
across the bay in Parkertown, where Suter had been born and still lives today. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one knew it at the time, the island's days were numbered. On Feb. 
4, 1920, a storm ripped an inlet through Tucker's Beach, a narrow strip of sand 
that formed the tip of Long Beach Island and protected Tucker's Island from the 
fury of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the inlet widened to the south, consuming Tucker's 
Beach and exposing Tucker's Island to the open sea. The relentless ocean began 
chewing up the island and, one by one, its buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the Little Egg Harbor Light House, which had stood for nearly a 
century, tumbled into the sea. The ever-encroaching ocean forced the Coast 
Guard to evacuate the island in 1930, according to Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's Island officially ceased to exist in 1932, when Long Beach Township 
removed it from the tax rolls. But a small piece of land where the little 
schoolhouse stood survived until 1938, when it was swept away during a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only the sand bar is left, and many people Suter meets find it hard to 
believe that so picturesque an island ever stood there. 
</P>
<P>
"People will argue with me about Tucker's Island," she said. "But I always tell 
them, 'I know what it was really like. I lived there.' "

BUSH ORDERS AGENCIES TO TRIM SPENDING PLANS

<P>
The White House on Saturday ordered the government to prepare for drastic 
program cutbacks beginning Oct. 15 in the event that efforts to reach a budget 
compromise fail. 
</P>
<P>
In an order issued at President Bush's vacation home here, the President told 
all federal agencies to sharply cut back on their spending beginning Oct. 1, 
pending further notice. 
</P>
<P>
Administration and congressional leaders are seeking to assemble a package of 
roughly $50 billion in deficit-reduction measures, including both spending cuts 
and new tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But progress has come slowly. While Republicans privately offered a plan 
earlier this month, the Democrats have yet to make a counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, a failure to reach an agreement by 
Oct. 1 will trigger across-the-board cuts in most federal programs totaling 
more than $100 billion. These would take effect Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Budget negotiators have set a self-imposed Sept. 10 deadline for reaching a 
compromise, and they plan to meet Sept. 6-7 at Andrews Air Force Base in 
Maryland to get down to work. 
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement between congressional leaders and the White House is 
concluded, it must then be approved by both the House and Senate and signed 
into law by the President. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is not reached by Sept. 7, the negotiators have said they 
probably will work through the weekend in an effort to settle remaining 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Under the presidential order issued Saturday, which was labeled an "initial 
order," beginning Oct. 1 all agencies would have to trim their actual spending 
enough to achieve more than $100 billion in savings government-wide over the 
next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
No new spending commitments, direct loans or loan guarantees could be made, and 
loans already approved would have to be scaled back.

NOVELIST RELIVES LABOR CAMP NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who turned long years as a 
political prisoner in the Soviet Union into his most powerful work, Chinese 
novelist Zhang Xianliang relives the ordeal of 22 years spent in labor camps. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang's best-known book in the West, the semi-autobiographical "Half of Man Is 
Woman," is about a young man sent to prison in China for 20 years for writing a 
poem. Living under watchful eyes of prison guards he is at nearly 40 still a 
virgin. 
</P>
<P>
To his horror he finds himself impotent when he manages to marry a fellow 
inmate. "That was me at a certain point of my experience in the camps," Zhang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang was consigned to hard labor at the age of 21 for writing a poem the 
authorities disapproved of. He emerged from the camps at 43 with a wellspring 
of images of an Orwellian nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"All the sorrow in that book was about me, but none of the happiness was about 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The novel's protagonist becomes infatuated with a sensuous woman prisoner, but 
must wait years until political conditions allow them to converse. He is 
bitterly disappointed by her venality but marries her nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Published in 1985, the book's sexually explicit passages created a sensation in 
China, where puritan values in literature still prevail. 
</P>
<P>
China's artists and writers have been the target of waves of persecution 
campaigns since the communist takeover in 1949. Zhang was swept up in a major 
one in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"They labelled me a rightist-deviationist because I wrote about my feelings 
about myself, my people and my country," said Zhang. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, I do not know what is a rightist or a leftist," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He was exiled from his home in Nanjing, the graceful old capital in China's 
southeast, to the desert wastes of Ningxia in the remote north. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Zhang sought refuge from politics by staying in Yinchuan to 
the south of the two labor camps where he once toiled. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of life in the tree-shaded city appears slow and relaxed compared with 
Beijing, where security remains tight after martial law was lifted last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its large Muslim minority, Yinchuan has a Middle Eastern air with 
many mosques and Islamic restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is, it's far from Beijing." Living in the Chinese capital left 
one too open to scrutiny, Zhang said. 
</P>
<P>
From his less exposed vantage point, Zhang continues to write about the anguish 
of lost freedom and his sadness at the craven deeds men sometimes commit to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
His current work, as yet untitled, is about starvation in labor camps during 
the 1960s. "It's more about the sad state of China's intellectuals than 
physical starvation," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and writers are again under siege as Beijing continues its crackdown on 
dissent, one year after the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent editors and journalists have been dismissed from their jobs 
and government-orchestrated orthodoxy is the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang has seen it all, in his youth lost in prison camps from 1957 to 1979. "I 
was never able to write in all those years. How could I? I was watched 
constantly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept my sanity during those years because I believed things would someday 
get better," he said. "But I still dream about those days a lot, even though I 
try not to think about them all the time." 
</P>
<P>
He confronts his nightmare past by writing about it. "It is my catharsis," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But he is understandably wary about going out on a limb, knowing what it cost 
him in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang, now 53 and owlish in large-framed glasses, married at the age of 44, a 
year after he emerged from prison. He has a 9-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he made $4,250 as a flat fee for "Half of Man Is Woman," hardly a 
princely sum compared with what successful writers in the West can expect. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese authors do not earn royalties, so even large sales do not benefit them, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if one gets the Nobel Prize, at least one's reputation is helped," he said 
with a laugh.

VAN DE KAMP FIRES WARNING AT JUSTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on Saturday criticized California Supreme 
Court rulings limiting legal rights in civil cases and warned that the justices 
eventually could face voter rebellion like their predecessors in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's remarks, made before delegates to the annual convention of the 
State Bar, represented his first such criticism of the court since a 
conservative majority gained power after the defeat of Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird and two other liberal court members four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the nation's leading court in development of civil law, in recent years 
the court has stopped dead in the water and even appears to be reversing 
course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is far too soon to panic," the attorney general said. "But I would remind 
the current justices of the hard lesson their predecessors learned at the 
polls: A court that retreats from the world around it treads on dangerous 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Bird and Justices Joseph R. Grodin and Cruz Reynoso were the targets 
of heavy political attack because of their record on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Van de Kamp cited rulings by the new court under Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas limiting the liability of employers and insurers. The 
justices, he said, had often moved to restrict the legal rights of victims -- 
such as "those unfairly fired from their jobs and those exploited by predatory 
insurance practices." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Lucas court barred workers from collecting potentially sizable 
punitive damages for wrongful discharge. In another case, the justices 
prohibited accident victims from suing insurance companies after denial of a 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for 
governor in June, told reporters after his speech that he did not seek -- and 
did not expect -- voters to deny confirmation to the five justices expected to 
be on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a tremendous resentment of this court, nor should there be," he 
said. "I'm merely raising a warning flag." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp credited the new court for being "properly conscious" of the need 
to restore its credibility and conceded its heavy death penalty backlog left 
relatively little time for civil matters. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters there were some indications that in its rulings limiting 
civil suits, the court was "more concerned with its workload than the substance 
or merits of the cases." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to remember that courts gain respect by the credibility of their 
judgments and that courts that tend to go off the deep end either way can find 
themselves in disrepute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two justices attending the Bar convention told reporters after the speech that 
they made their decisions solely on the merits of the cases and without concern 
for whether they would be confirmed by voters. 
</P>
<P>
"What the electorate wants to do in 1990, it will do, " said Justice Edward A. 
Panelli. "We have no hidden agenda. We decide cases as we see them." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Van de Kamp's reference to a philosophical shift in course, 
Justice Armand Arabian said, "To view our work solely as a shifting of the 
pendulum is totally inaccurate." As for the coming election, Arabian said, "I 
am in a state of absolute calm." 
</P>
<P>
In all, five appointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian may be on the 
ballot. Lucas and Justices Panelli, Arabian and Joyce L. Kennard already are 
facing confirmation by voters. The governor's most recent nominee to the high 
court, Appellate Justice Marvin R. Baxter of Fresno, will be on the ballot if 
confirmed by the state Judicial Appointments Commission on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, concluding eight years in office, sharply criticized the court 
system for the failure to implement the state's death penalty law. California 
reinstated capital punishment in 1977. While more than 200 convicted murderers 
have since been sentenced to death, their appeals remain in state and federal 
courts and none has been executed.

Life is not all misery in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
On a lazy Sunday the war seems far away as Phnom Penh residents picnic by a 
river, take their children to the Royal Palace or stroll along a palm-lined 
esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, jam-packed jalopies and motorcycles balancing two or three 
passengers tear down the road to Koki, a wooded glade 10 miles out of town 
where meadows slope down to the banks of the Mekong River. 
</P>
<P>
Stalls sell barbecued chicken and grilled fish on sticks, sugar cane, durian 
and other fruits. Open-air bars offer European beer, imported via Singapore, 
while sound systems blare out Khmer songs set to a disco beat. 
</P>
<P>
Families sit lunching under thatched shelters built on stilts over the river. 
You can float in the coffee-colored water in a rubber tire or take a ride in a 
sampan poled by an Asian gondolier wearing a trilby and dirty shorts. 
</P>
<P>
At makeshift outdoor casinos, gamblers lay bets on numbered boards. The barker, 
shouting a running commentary into a microphone, spins a wheel fixed to the 
back wall and a customer hurls a dart hoping to spear the winning number. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the picnickers are overseas Khmers who have met success in the United 
States or Europe and are back visiting their families. 
</P>
<P>
Others are from the middle class that has sprung up since the nation's 
pragmatic young prime minister, Hun Sen, loosened the economy from its 
communist controls two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't allowed to come here in Pol Pot's time," said one man, referring to 
the 1975-79 rule of the radical Khmer Rouge, when the capital was evacuated and 
its citizens made to work in labor camps. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the city, a volleyball game is under way in the courtyard of the French 
Embassy, where foreign residents sought refuge when the Khmer Rouge took over 
the city. It since has been abandoned by Paris. 
</P>
<P>
People crowd into the Royal Palace -- the entry fee is 900 riels (about $2) for 
foreigners, 10 riels for Cambodians. 
</P>
<P>
Crippled war veterans, their legs blown off by land mines, sit begging at the 
gate as a blind beggar scrapes a dirge on a Chinese violin. 
</P>
<P>
The palace was built by French colonial rulers on old Khmer style at the turn 
of the century, the roofs of its buildings curved upwards at the corners and 
covered in gilt. 
</P>
<P>
A European-style house built by Napoleon III for his queen and later shipped to 
Cambodia as a gift for King Norodom stands incongruously in one corner. 
</P>
<P>
The throne room is the main attraction, although many of its treasures were 
carted off by the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
The bedroom used by former monarch Norodom Sihanouk -- now in exile and the 
most prominent spokesman for the guerrilla coalition fighting Phnom Penh -- can 
be seen complete with the air-conditioner he had installed. 
</P>
<P>
Special permission is needed to visit the Silver Pagoda. Its floor is lined 
with six tons of silver and its centerpiece is a diamond-studded Buddha made of 
almost 200 pounds of gold.

NEW ORLEANS PREPARES EVICTION NOTICES FOR HISTORIC TOMBS RAVAGED BY TIME, 
NEGLECT 
</P>

NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Halpin probably thought the mausoleum he built 125 years ago would be 
his family's final resting place. 
</P>
<P>
But unless one of his descendants can be found, the generations of Halpins 
inside the dilapidated tomb will be exhumed and the crypt will be renovated and 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: a 1974 law under which New Orleans tombs in need of renovation can 
be confiscated and the remains moved to unmarked mausoleums elsewhere in the 
same cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Called "The Cities of the Dead," New Orleans' 31 historic cemeteries mirror the 
city in miniature and in marble. Laid out along twisting lanes, bedecked with 
cast iron fences and carved in elaborate architectural detail, the tombs form 
whitewashed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tourists a day visit the tombs, which were built above ground 
because New Orleans is below sea level, too wet for graves. 
</P>
<P>
Some tombs, such as those of William Claiborne, the first American governor of 
Louisiana, and New Orleans voodoo queen Marie Laveau, are maintained through a 
special preservation fund. But other tombs are the responsibility of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cemeteries have been ravaged by years of neglect. Recently, 
lightning blasted apart a brick wall of 56 vaults in the Lafayette Cemetery, 
exposing rusty coffin hinges, bags of bones and skulls. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans Archdiocese, which owns six of the old cemeteries on almost 50 
acres, has upgraded streets, drainage and monuments in the cemeteries over the 
years. Now the church, along with a volunteer group, hopes to use the 1974 law 
to restore hundreds of abandoned tombs built 60 to 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's your house and the city isn't going to come in and renovate your house," 
said Bret Clesi, president of Save Our Cemeteries, which gives tours to raise 
money for restoration. "If the family doesn't maintain it, it should go to 
someone who will." 
</P>
<P>
Among the tombs in need of repair is the Halpin family crypt on the main street 
of St. Patrick Cemetery No. 3. Its soft red bricks are loose and weeds grow 
along the edge of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"This tomb could be beautifully restored. If it's left as it is, it will just 
continue to deteriorate," said Michael D. Boudreaux, assistant director of the 
New Orleans Archdiocesan Cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese is trying to locate tomb owners by advertising in newspapers, 
by mail and through notices posted on the crypts. Under the 1974 law, officials 
must try for a year to trace heirs, then wait three more years before 
repossessing the tombs. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, the archdiocese has located 40 to 50 descendants, 
many of whom didn't know about their family tomb until they were contacted 
about restoring it, Boudreaux said. So far, no tombs have been confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
Boudreaux put the costs of restoration at $2,000 to $3,000 per tomb, although 
Save Our Cemeteries said some could run $30,000 or more. Families also must pay 
a one-time $2,400 for perpetual care to assure that the tombs don't fall into 
disrepair again, Boudreaux said. 
</P>
<P>
If a restored tomb is resold, the remains inside will be put in another crypt 
and records will be kept to show where they are, Boudreaux said. He said there 
have been no objections so far. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tomb is ready to fall down anyway, I'm not too sure you can be 
concerned about moving the remains," Clesi said.

TIMES' WRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We commend The Times for its environmental efforts and enjoy the "recycling 
spots" in the paper. However, we have a difficult time believing The Times' 
commitment to the environment when every morning (rain or shine), we receive 
our Times double wrapped in non-recyclable, non-biodegradable plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
This seems illogical in a part of the country where we have had drought 
conditions for four years and average only 12 inches of rain per year. Not only 
does it not make sense ecologically, but the costs (passed on to readers) must 
be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
We'd like to see The Times show the type of leadership in the environmental 
arena that we have come to expect from the West's finest newspaper.

LINDBERGH NEEDS A SHORT-TERM FIX; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SEARCH FOR NEW SITE SHOULD BE PRESSED BEFORE SPENDING $289 MILLION OR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to argue with much of what Lindbergh Field's many critics have to 
say. The downtown airport is in the wrong place for a growing metropolis, 
making for some white-knuckle flying past city skyscrapers. The single runway 
is uncomfortably short, maybe dangerously so. The noise created by takeoffs 
over Point Loma and Loma Portal is horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Lindbergh has to be moved. We all know it. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if city leaders picked a site tomorrow, there would be no new airport 
for at least a decade, probably more. That's why Lindbergh must be expanded to 
handle passenger traffic that is expected to steadily increase over the next 
decade. The continued growth of San Diego's economy also demands it. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the question of how much expansion is necessary. For now, the 
$27-million emergency plan already adopted by the Port District appears 
adequate. We see no reason for the port to leap ahead with either of two very 
expensive expansion plans that would take Lindbergh into the early part of next 
century, and in the process take the urgency out of the new effort to create a 
binational airport on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The interim plan now being implemented would take care of Lindbergh's most 
critical needs. It would move the leaking fuel tanks that supply Lindbergh's 
jets, increasing fuel storage capacity limited by Lindbergh's cramped 
configuration. That would take trucks that must constantly replenish 
Lindbergh's one-day fuel supply off Harbor Drive. It would add eight passenger 
gates and baggage claim areas. It would build a better access route to Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Those improvements would allow Lindbergh to accommodate about 16.5 million 
passengers, the number expected to use the airport by 1996 or 1997. The two 
major expansion options -- one costing $289 million, the other priced at $385 
million -- are designed to stretch airport capacity to about 24 million, the 
number of passengers expected by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be time to consider those options in the future. The port 
should set itself a reasonable short-term deadline for determining if the 
latest effort is going to take off. If it doesn't -- and recent history does 
not indicate much hope of success -- the Port can take up the expansion plans 
discussed at this week's public hearing. That hearing was held only because the 
City Council asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
If the port is in the mood to spend money, it might want to consider purchasing 
the ill-conceived Laurel Travel Center at the foot of the runway and taking it 
down a level or two. That would ameliorate the fears of pilots who have called 
it an accident waiting to happen -- regardless of the FAA's opinion that the 
building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to derail the effort to relocate Lindbergh to a better 
spot by making plans to expand the current site to accommodate 24 million 
people.

Whoa! Just a minute. Since when is it Caltrans' responsibility to protect 
lawbreakers ("Mother Learns Her Boy Died Crossing I-5," Aug. 17)? 
</P>
<P>
It is a damn shame there have been so many killed while trying to bolt across

where it belongs, and it is not Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
It is squarely on the people who are doing the running, and in this case the 
fault of the mother (sorry to say) who took six kids and tried to run across 
eight lanes of highway. Please don't try to tell me she did not know it was 
dangerous.

JIM MURRAY: HIS TOUCH MADE DODGERS SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that it's the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Dodgers, a few of 
the savants were sitting around trying to decide who was the most valuable 
Dodger in the history of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
That's easy. 
</P>
<P>
The most artful Dodger of them all never hit a homer with the bases full, stole 
home in a pennant race, struck out the side with the tying run on third or got 
Willie Mays to pop up with the game or the championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most valuable individual never played an inning, made out a 
lineup, moved an infield in, picked up a ground ball, laid down a bunt or stole 
a base. 
</P>
<P>
He never made an error, either. 
</P>
<P>
He's left-handed, reads lips. You can count on him for 150-160 impeccable games 
a year. He always shows up ready for the game, never hits the disabled list. 
He's a manager's wish, an owner's dream. 
</P>
<P>
I would say, off hand, the only one who comes close is Jackie Robinson. 
Robinson's contributions, too, were more than just on the ballfield. 
</P>
<P>
But when you look down the all-time roster and see the glorious names of Dazzy 
Vance, Sandy Koufax, Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Don 
Drysdale, Maury Wills, Don Newcombe, Max Carey or Van Lingle Mungo, you figure 
some guy poring through the rubble of an archeological dig one day will not 
have even heard of my candidate. His lifetime average isn't in there -- but he 
was a .400 hitter, all right, and he had an awesome assortment of pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Edward Scully meant as much or more to the Dodgers than any .300 hitter 
they ever signed, any 20-game winner they ever fielded. True, he didn't limp to 
home plate and hit the home run that turned a season into a miracle -- but he 
knew what to do with it so it would echo through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to over-estimate Scully's value to the Dodgers. His mellifluous 
tone, wafting over the evening air in a ballpark because every transistor in 
the stadium is tuned to it, has made baseball a field of dreams for three 
generations of fans. Once, an umpire named Beans Reardon barked at an impatient 
manager, chafing because the ump waffled over a decision: "It ain't nuthin' 
till I say what it is!" In a sense, 35 years of Dodger fans could say: It ain't 
nuthin' till Scully tells us. 
</P>
<P>
Scully made an art out of baseball broadcasting. He also made journalism out of 
it. In a profession so full of "homers" -- not the four-base kind, the kind 
where the guy in the booth root-root-roots for the home team -- Scully 
distanced himself from partisanship. In 1959, in a surprised moment as the 
Dodgers won a pennant on a throwing error, Scully blurted, "We go to Chicago!" 
It became an L.A. catch-phrase but, so far as is known, it is the only time 
Scully used the pronoun we instead of the Dodgers on the air. 
</P>
<P>
He leveled with the fans. They could trust Scully. "It's playable!" he would 
assure them of a long, high drive that some shriller denizens of the broadcast 
booth might want to milk for some suspense. 
</P>
<P>
It was a masterful job of self-control because Scully was as closely identified 
with the fortunes of the Dodgers as any manager, player or owner they ever had. 
Scully really told it like it is -- always. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that he didn't love the Dodgers. It was just that he loved the game. 
"I remember when I first got the job," Scully says. "I was just a kid, a street 
kid. And here I was broadcasting the Brooklyn Dodgers!" 
</P>
<P>
His awe never compromised his neutrality. "I think it was a New York thing," he 
says. "We were above cheerleading. I remember once we went to Philadelphia, and 
a Philadelphia writer showed up in the press box with a Phillies cap on. He was 
scorned. We felt in New York we were reporters, not pompon girls." 
</P>
<P>
It's not possible to overstate what Scully meant to the franchise shift to L.A. 
Here was this team, in the mold of carpetbaggers, pulling into a strange town 
3,000 miles from their home base and trying to blend in. Scully midwifed this 
delicate process. Some front-office colleagues took the typically New York 
attitude that they were slumming among the uninitiated, rubes who knew nothing 
of the game of baseball. Scully tactfully took to going to as many luncheons as 
they could schedule. He put the right smiling face on the community's new 
neighbors -- and representatives. He took the we out of broadcasting but put 
the our in community relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they knew baseball out here," Scully says. "It was just some of the 
individual players they weren't familiar with. Oh sure, they knew the stars, 
the Reeses, the Drysdales, Sniders, Furillos. But I take no credit for the 
transistor tune-ins. You have to remember when we played in the Coliseum, some 
of those fans were 79 rows up, a half-mile from the action. It made sense to 
bring a radio." 
</P>
<P>
It was Scully's finest year, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had a bad team," he says. "A decision had to be reached whether to 
go with the established stars or try to run in a bunch of unknown kids. It was 
decided to go with the name players." 
</P>
<P>
Scully sold Los Angeles on the Dodgers -- with a team that finished next to 
last. Scully was the master at distracting attention from the inept, the 
boring. He didn't broadcast a game, he narrated it. 
</P>
<P>
Scully could have left the Dodgers. Network contracts in the high millions were 
dangled. And sometimes accepted. The temptation not to have to get in a car and 
drive down the freeway to the ballpark every night must have been enticing. 
</P>
<P>
But he found life without the Dodgers unthinkable. Scully without the Dodgers 
was Caruso without an opera, any troubadour without a song. 
</P>
<P>
He kept his feet in the shoals of celebrity. "In New York, I was a guy who rode 
the subway to work and lived in a fifth-floor walk-up. To the neighborhood, I 
was just a guy who worked nights." 
</P>
<P>
He still works nights. And the Dodgers are glad of it. 
</P>
<P>
Scully was probably the least surprised guy in the ballpark when the Dodgers 
blew an eight-run lead in the ninth the other night. "The Dodgers never do 
anything easy," he says. "They don't win easy -- and they don't lose easy. But 
I'll tell you something: They have seemed to be touched ever since they came to 
L.A. Call it magic or luck, but just when things get to their worst, somebody 
touches a wand and here comes a Koufax or a Larry Sherry or a Maury Wills or a 
Kirk Gibson." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are an outfit you'd want to get next to in a lifeboat. 
</P>
<P>
But if there's one thing Scully decries today, it's what he calls "single-file 
baseball." He explains: "We used to do things together. So did the team. We 
went by train but even when we moved West, on the days off, the whole 
organization got together for a golf outing. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the players arrive in single file. They get dressed in single file. If 
they do get on the team bus, they get on one by one. They sit behind each other 
on airplanes. Sometimes you think it's a clubhouse of strangers." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are 100 years old. Scully has been with them almost 40. In that 
time, attendances of 2 million -- thought impossible for a baseball franchise 
-- became commonplace in Los Angeles. Then, 3-million attendances were achieved 
six times. 
</P>
<P>
Scully was there for all of them. It may have been a coincidence, but I think 
not. Scully will never be MVP -- most valuable player. But he has to be MVD -- 
most valuable Dodger.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE DAYS OF WHINE, NOT ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Bret Johnson is leaving the UCLA football program because of this 
unique ability he has. 
</P>
<P>
He reads coaches' minds. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there was a predetermination that Bret Johnson would not start at 
quarterback no matter what," said Bret Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Who also said: 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I am part of the fallout from last season." 
</P>
<P>
And went on to say: 
</P>
<P>
"The quarterback has been fired. I feel strongly now that this decision was 
known months ago." 
</P>
<P>
Boy, if Johnson could read defenses the way he reads between the lines, he'd be 
a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback of last season's 3-7-1 football team cannot imagine why UCLA 
might be eager to try somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Donahue, head coach for 14 years, and offensive coordinator Homer Smith, 
a football coach since 1958, actually had the nerve to demote Bret Johnson 
without getting his approval. No wonder he split. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, when Bret was the bravest bull at El Toro High, he made it clear to 
anybody recruiting him that he was not going to play football for them unless 
they checked everything with him first. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is offended, even outraged, because the UCLA coaches gave away his job 
to Jim (License to Kill) Bonds without even running any full-pad scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no problem with being a backup quarterback," Johnson 
explained, "but only if I were fairly beaten out by another guy." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah. What a dirty trick, giving his three-victory squad to some other guy who 
didn't even outplay him in a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, there has been no justifiable reason in the selection of the 
quarterback at UCLA," Johnson continued. 
</P>
<P>
And let's never forget that college football coaches should always justify 
their decisions to players as opinionated and experienced as Bret Johnson, 
whose career dates nearly a 50th of a century. 
</P>
<P>
Good to know, isn't it, that Bret chose the University of California at Los 
Angeles for its fine, quality education and for the chance to play football 
with a swell bunch of guys. 
</P>
<P>
He is free to go, and go he shall, because he only wants to play with UCLA's 
other players if they let him start. 
</P>
<P>
In his declaration of independence after bolting camp -- Johnson might be the 
first collegian ever to fax his decision to drop out -- the quarterback said he 
intends to go someplace else because he does not want to "be involved in a 
quarterback controversy every year, as is the standard at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, all you other coaches out there thinking about throwing Johnson 
a scholarship, remember to do so only if you promise not to have a quarterback 
controversy during his remaining years on campus. 
</P>
<P>
If you bench him, you lose him. If you consider playing somebody else, you had 
better have a mighty good reason. At least make sure you have had a proper 
scrimmage. Otherwise, you might get sued for breach of promise. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't try to pull anything cute, because remember, he knows what you 
are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro, Bret Johnson was one of the best prep quarterbacks anywhere. In his 
sophomore year at UCLA, he beat out Jim (From Valencia With Love) Bonds fair 
and square. 
</P>
<P>
Did Bonds up and quit? 
</P>
<P>
Did he tell Terry Donahue to get a second opinion? 
</P>
<P>
Did he nudge Donahue on the sideline during losses to Arizona, Oregon State, 
Washington, Stanford and Oregon and say: "Seen enough of this dude, Coach?" 
</P>
<P>
Did he fax in his RSVP that he wouldn't be coming to next season's party? 
</P>
<P>
No, Jim (Live and Let Play) Bonds checked into seven of the 11 Bruin games, 
chucked a touchdown pass in one of them, threw four interceptions in another, 
came to practice and kept his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Bret Johnson was told after spring practice that the first-string 
quarterback position had not yet been decided. During the fourth week of 
August, the position was decided. Where's the beef? The coaches told Johnson 
they'd decide, and they decided. Same way they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
The telepathic Johnson picked up other signals through his magic helmet. 
</P>
<P>
They knew in their hearts that he wouldn't start, so they jerked him around. 
</P>
<P>
That's why he is rolling out to his left, down Westwood Boulevard and up 
Wilshire to the 405. Because Johnson wants to go someplace that is "free of any 
pre-bias against me." 
</P>
<P>
The only pre-bias UCLA's coaches had against him was three victories in 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I would now like to go to a school that has stability and could benefit from 
my style of play," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad more nursery schools don't need quarterbacks. 
</P>

ROOKIE RECEIVER LIFTS RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before the season opener, the three-man battle for the Rams' starting 
tailback job has given way to a three-man race at another position -- backup 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have imagined in July that someone named Derrick Faison would push 
Curt Warner out of the spotlight? 
</P>
<P>
In the Rams' 27-7 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals before 44,134 at Anaheim 
Stadium Saturday night, the tailback race between Gaston Green and Warner 
fizzled for the moment. Green gained 21 yards in nine carries; Warner had 24 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for the team's No. 4 receiver spot, however, turned up a notch, 
especially when the team's only healthy starter, Henry Ellard, left the game in 
the first quarter because of a strained groin. Ellard did manage to get the 
first reception of the summer for the starting receiving corps, catching a 
nine-yard pass over the middle with 13:18 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the night was left for the likes of Faison, a rookie free agent who 
is competing with Tim Stallworth and Tony Lomack for one open position. 
</P>
<P>
Against Phoenix, Faison had scoring receptions of 26 and 23 yards and finished 
with four catches for 73 yards, and he could have had more. 
</P>
<P>
Faison beat his man deep in the first quarter but quarterback Jim Everett left 
the pass short and Faison couldn't hold on to the ball. Faison came back with 
an 11-yard reception later in the drive on a play in which his defender, Jay 
Taylor, was called for pass interference. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Faison added a 26-yard scoring reception to put the Rams 
ahead, 20-0. Faison made that play while having his face-mask yanked by Tracey 
Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Faison made another juggling catch over the middle for a 
23-yard touchdown, putting the Rams ahead by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Faison? He's a 6-foot-4 rookie from Howard University who played 
basketball his senior year in college, not football. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Faison is capable of big plays," Coach John Robinson said. "He's 
got some stuff that's unusual, I think all three men are going to play in the 
NFL. We've got some decisions to make, but they've done an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly as impressive as Faison was Lomack, the ninth-round pick from Florida. 
He finished with two catches for 91 yards, including an 80-yard scoring pass 
from Everett late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lomack suffered a strained hamstring near the end of his scoring run 
and couldn't return for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
That left the door open for Stallworth, who didn't have a catch in the first 
half. He made up for it with a difficult catch on a 27-yard pass from 
quarterback Chuck Long on the Rams' first drive of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem for the Ram receivers is health. When Stallworth was forced 
from the game in the second half because of a bruised right toe, it left Faison 
as the only available receiver with a chance to make the team. Also unavailable 
were Ellard, Aaron Cox (hamstring) and Flipper Anderson (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm as worried about this football team as any that I've had coming 
this close to the season," Robinson said. "We've had an unbelievable number of 
injures. We lost Ellard again to groin, we don't think it's serious. But it's 
the same routine, we can't seem to get any rhythm at wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Everett received his most extensive work of the summer, playing the entire 
first half. For the night, he completed 10 of 19 passes for 193 yards with one 
touchdown and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Long had his best day as a Ram, completing seven of 10 passes for 155 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' first score was set up by new corner Bobby Humphery, who intercepted 
his second pass of the summer in the second quarter when he stepped in front of 
a Timm Rosenbach pass and returned it nine yards to the Phoenix 22. Four plays 
later, Mike Lansford kicked a 37-yard field goal to give the Rams a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rookie free agent Derrick Faison started at wide receiver in place of Flipper 
Anderson, who was sidelined because of a sore right hamstring. . . . Welcome to 
the league: Former Indiana running back Anthony Thompson, the Cardinals' first 
draft pick, was stopped for no gain on his first NFL carry after a crushing 
tackle by safety Vince Newsome. Thompson ended his holdout with the team this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
These Rams did not play because of injuries: tackles Irv Pankey (back) and Rob 
Cox (ribs), cornerback Darryl Henley (hip), Cleveland Gary (back), defensive 
tackle Brian Smith (knee), linebackers Fred Strickland (hamstring) and Mel 
Owens (back), receiver Aaron Cox and nose tackle Sean Smith (ankle).

RARE HOMER GETS GONZALEZ RARE WELCOME; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: HIS GAME-WINNER IN 14TH INNING ATONES FOR BEING PICKED OFF AS A 
PINCH-RUNNER AND BRINGS 3-2 VICTORY OVER THE METS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way Jose Gonzalez figures it, the best part of his Saturday wasn't the 
14th-inning home run or the Dodger victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the home-plate hug from Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt funny. I think that was the first time that has happened to me," 
Gonzalez said of the embrace from the Dodger manager after Gonzalez ended a 4 
1/2-hour marathon with a home run to beat the New York Mets, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much chance for Lasorda to hug players who don't play. Gonzalez, 
who has not started since June 9, has played in only 39 of the 72 games since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
There is also not much chance for Lasorda to hug players who get picked off 
first base in the ninth inning of a tie game. That embarrassing moment happened 
to Gonzalez after he entered the game as a pinch-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"How much worse can you get than to be picked off like that?" Gonzalez asked. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get much better than redeeming yourself with a game-winning hit, 
which Gonzalez discovered by sending a one-out, full-count pitch from Ron 
Darling over the left-field fence and into the Dodger bullpen, ending the 
season's longest game for both teams before 38,269 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The outfielder, who said he has twice asked to be traded this year, would not 
trade the moment for anything. Minutes after the game, he already had a 
black-and-white snapshot of his swing hanging above his locker. 
</P>
<P>
He sighed and added: "It's been no fun sitting on the bench for three or four 
months. I'm just glad to get up there and do something." 
</P>
<P>
The homer ensured the Dodgers would stay tied with the San Francisco Giants in 
second place in the National League West, 6 1/2 games behind the Cincinnati 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
It also kept the players from canceling their plans for a rare free Saturday 
night at home, which they thought was safe because this game started at 12:22 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we still have time to go to the movies?" Gonzalez asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead against Sid Fernandez in the fourth inning but were 
shut out on four hits in the next nine until Gonzalez's blast. The Mets had 
tied the game with a run in the sixth and seventh innings and then were shut 
out on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it was going, this was a game we desperately needed," said Lasorda, 
who used all of his position players and all available pitchers except for 
rookie Dave Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Darling, who made his ninth relief appearance of the season in the 12th inning 
because the only remaining available Met pitcher was stopper John Franco, 
retired seven of nine Dodgers until he faced Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll sleep well tonight," Darling said. "And I won't." 
</P>
<P>
It was Gonzalez's second homer of the year, the seventh of his three-year 
career. And he was not trying to hit a homer. He was merely trying to end his 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't get any action, then all of a sudden you're in the game seeing 
Ron Darling . . . you look for a fastball and just let it go," Gonzalez said. 
"That's all I did, let it go." 
</P>
<P>
When he reached home plate, most of the team was already in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was quiet after I got picked off, and everybody was quiet after the 
home run," Gonzalez said with a smile. "Typical day for me." 
</P>
<P>
And typical for the Dodgers, who, by playing in their eighth one-run game in 
nine days, could have won or lost several times before the 14th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Mets' Kevin McReynolds led off the 14th with a single to left against 
winning pitcher Don Aase. McReynolds stole second, still with none out. But he 
was stranded there when Tom O'Malley struck out, Todd Hundley flied out and 
Darling, forced to bat for himself because of a nine-man Mets pitching staff, 
grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Mets had a chance in the 11th when Howard Johnson and McReynolds 
singled, putting runners on first and third with one out. But O'Malley fouled 
to third and Hundley hit a fly ball that Gibson chased down near the warning 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Mets had a chance in the top of the ninth after consecutive one-out 
singles by McReynolds and O'Malley, but McReynolds tried to take third on 
O'Malley's shallow hit to center field and was thrown out by Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers had a chance in the 12th when Rick Dempsey laid down a surprise 
one-out bunt for a single and Juan Samuel was hit by a pitch. But Mike Scioscia 
and Mickey Hatcher struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels was removed from the game in the fourth inning because of a lower 
back strain. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing the severity of back 
problems, his status is listed as day to day. Daniels is second on the team 
with 19 home runs and third with 63 runs batted in. Daniels missed eight games 
in late June because of a strained lower back. The Dodgers lost six of those 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Even with his game-winning homer, Jose Gonzalez said he doesn't think he will 
be a Dodger next season. "I'm the seventh outfielder, and I need a chance to 
play," he said, "and I know I can play somewhere."

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Left-Handed Compliment: One notable aspect of the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
improvement is their performance against left-handed pitching. The Pirates, 
22-31 vs. left-handers last year, were 36-19 through Thursday and 13-3 in the 
last 16 games started by left-handers. A major part of the credit goes to 
emerging third baseman Jeff King, the Pirates' No. 1 draft choice of 1986. The 
right-handed hitting King, in 33 games since the All-Star break, has batted 
.295 with six home runs and 20 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
* Red Socks: The Boston Red Sox, who have led or been near the top of the 
American League in team batting and near the bottom in home runs, are led in 
homers by Ellis Burks, with 13 -- an embarrassment to Fenway Park and its 
fabled left-field wall. Carl Yastrzemski and Rico Petrocelli each hit 15 in 
1974, the fewest ever by a Red Sox club leader. Mike Marshall's first home run 
as a member of the Red Sox Tuesday snapped a club drought of eight games, the 
longest Boston had gone without a homer since an 11-game span in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
* Stubbs Streak: Ex-Dodger Franklin Stubbs has caught Glenn Davis, who has been 
sidelined since June 25, for the Houston Astros' club lead in home runs (19) 
and runs batted in (50). In a recent five-day span, Stubbs broke up a perfect 
game by Bob Tewksbury with an eighth-inning double, hit only the second home 
run of the season off Lee Smith for a ninth-inning tie in a game the Astros won 
in 11, snapped Randy Tomlin's no-hit bid with a fifth-inning double and hit a 
two-run homer in the eighth to spoil John Smiley's shutout. 
</P>
<P>
* Blue Brew: Left fielder Greg Vaughn, who hit 26 home runs at Denver last year 
and showed enough through the first half of his first full big league season to 
prompt the Milwaukee Brewers to trade Glenn Braggs to the Cincinnati Reds, 
produced one hit in his last 47 at-bats through Thursday, his average dropping 
from .250 on July 4 to .212 and his role being reduced to that of a platoon 
player. Vaughn has celebrated company in Robin Yount, the American League's 
incumbent MVP. Yount hit .271 in April, .237 in May, .245 in June, .243 in July 
and .185 through his first 81 at-bats of August. His average with runners in 
scoring position: .367 last season and .212 this season. Said Jim Gantner: "I'm 
sure this is eating him up inside. He's such a competitor. It shows it can 
happen to the best of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
* Giant Pains: The injury wave continues to roll over the San Francisco Giants. 
A pulled rib-cage muscle has sidelined pitcher Trevor Wilson, marking the 15th 
time the Giants have used the disabled list, a National League high. The Giants 
have employed 13 starting pitchers and 24 overall. They have had 26 pitchers in 
uniform, one shy of the major league record. How remarkable is it that they are 
still in contention? Consider where the three clubs that share the 
single-season record of 27 pitchers finished: The 1915 Philadelphia A's were 58 
1/2 games out; the '55 Kansas City A's were 33 1/2 out and the '67 Mets were 40 
1/2 out. ROSS NEWHAN

ACHING A'S FIND WHITE SOX WON'T GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How best to describe the impertinent Chicago White Sox and their dogged pursuit 
of the Oakland Athletics in the American League West? 
</P>
<P>
Chicago General Manager Larry Himes said the A's are probably finding that his 
team is comparable to a migraine. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't shake us," he said. "We're like a bad headache. They wake up in the 
morning and we're there. And aspirin won't help." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox have definitely been a pain to the A's, who have always felt they 
can tolerate what anyone throws at them simply because they are better than 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the A's still feel they can cope with a headache, but the pain from 
their own debilitating injuries is becoming acute. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with the hamstring and back problems affecting the availability and 
performances of Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on a wet and substandard field in Chicago the other night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Walt Weiss suffered a rib-cage pull and is day to day as the A's 
weigh the disabled list. Teammate Terry Steinbach missed 24 games with a 
similar injury earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Dave Henderson injured a knee that will require arthroscopic 
surgery and could sideline him for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
On a team of marquee names, the less flamboyant Dave Henderson is a quiet 
leader and clutch player batting .272 with 19 homers, 59 runs batted in and a 
history of being at his best in September and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the biggest loss of all the injured players we've had the last three 
years," pitcher Dave Stewart said of Henderson. "On the field, in the 
clubhouse, big plays, big hits -- he's the most underrated player on this team 
in terms of impact." 
</P>
<P>
For now, rookie Darren Lewis is filling in for a player the A's seem to 
consider irreplaceable, the captain of the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose his leadership in that area alone," Stewart said. " 'Hendu' keeps guys 
on the ball. Darren's not going to be able to tell Jose or Rickey to move, 
where to play. And even if he did, even if he knew when and how to do that, 
would they listen?" 
</P>
<P>
A four-time Gold Glove winner, Kirby Puckett is being moved from center field 
to right by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
He will platoon there for the rest of the season, then move permanently in 
1991, providing the Twins find a full-time replacement in center. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirby has had a pretty good career out there, but this might save him a few 
miles," Manager Tom Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
What Kelly didn't say is that the Twins have grown concerned about the number 
of balls falling in front of the deep-playing Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett is taking it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this will probably help my career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Devon White or Gary Pettis or one of those guys who plays shallow and 
still covers everything." 
</P>
<P>
Of his bid for a fourth consecutive National League batting title, which would 
be the longest streak since Rogers Hornsby won six in a row starting in 1920, 
the San Diego Padres' Tony Gwynn referred to current leader Lenny Dykstra, 
saying: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pressure might get to Dykstra, but for me and Willie (McGee) it's 
not first or foremost on our minds. We've done it before and know we can do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the New York Mets' Dave Magadan, now second to Dykstra and about 20 
points ahead of Gwynn, is not first or foremost on his mind either. 
</P>
<P>
A misguided campaign to re-name Anaheim Stadium in honor of Gene Autry, the 
Angels' owner, has met justifiable opposition from Anaheim city council members 
Tom Daly, Miriam Kaywood and Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Autry showed some courage in moving to Orange County in 1966, though it is 
worth remembering that Walt Disney had already done the research and surveys 
and was the real pioneer there, and that the Angels, dying in Dodger Stadium, 
had no other substantive offers. 
</P>
<P>
It is also worth remembering that Anaheim, a city of 150,000 then, supplied the 
land and finances for the construction of the stadium and has received Autry's 
gratitude through: (1) a suit that has cost the city and its taxpayers millions 
of dollars, and (2) an error-prone operation producing three division titles 
and 15 finishes of .500 or worse in the first 24 years there. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps, more than all else, it is worth remembering that it was Autry who 
refused to rename his franchise the Anaheim Angels because he was afraid 
"Anaheim" might generate laughs on Madison Avenue reminiscent of those Jack 
Benny got when he linked Anaheim with Azusa and Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Why now should the city be expected to rename its stadium? It's enough that 
Gene Autry and the county have helped one another. Let the city keep its name 
in lights. If it can't have Broadway, let it at least have State College 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Did George Steinbrenner unravel the New York Yankees' front office mess with 
his last-gasp reappointment of Gene Michael as general manager, or did he 
merely rearrange it? 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell. For the present, Michael is the final authority on baseball 
matters, but both he and George Bradley, who now carries the title of vice 
president of baseball operations, can initiate trade talks, as both Bradley and 
Pete Peterson had been doing, often tripping over the other's phone line. 
</P>
<P>
It is also unclear as to whether Michael or Bradley will conduct contract 
negotiations, and the Yankees have five players eligible for free agency -- 
Dave Righetti, Tim Leary, Mike Witt, Jeff Robinson and Wayne Tolleson. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there seemed to be at least one positive and one certainty 
stemming from Steinbrenner's final moves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The positive: Brian Sabean, credited with restoring stability to the Yankee 
farm and scouting system as director of scouting, was elevated to vice 
president of player development and scouting -- Bradley's former job -- and 
given a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, through Friday, had the best record in the American League East 
since the All-Star break, and much of the credit belonged to rookies Kevin 
Maas, Oscar Azocar and Jim Leyritz -- products of a rebounding farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The certainty: The awarding of a three-year contract to Steinbrenner's 
son-in-law, Joseph Malloy, as vice president of finance was an indication that 
the Yankees will remain a family trust, with Malloy eventually handling the 
business end and Steinbrenner's youngest son, Harold, now a senior at Williams 
College, handling baseball matters. 
</P>
<P>
Can Steinbrenner stay out of it until then? Won't he be on the phone, violating 
commissioner Fay Vincent's ruling? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of people asking me that," Michael said. "They should know 
me better. Do you believe I'd risk my baseball life? I mean, he's not going to 
call. Besides, I've been known to hang up on him." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Thigpen of the White Sox and Dennis Eckersley of the A's are closing in 
on Righetti's single-season save record of 46, but that isn't Righetti's main 
concern. There's already unrest in new Yankeedom because of comments by Michael 
on Righetti's contract situation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not like the Righetti of old, but he's good," Michael said. "Other clubs 
have expressed interest in him, so we know he has value. The decision on how 
high we go will have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Said Righetti: "I'm hurt. It's hard every year to prove yourself. I was hoping 
he'd say I was doing a good job and that they'd want to keep me. Instead of 
hearing something decent out of his mouth, he said I wasn't as good as I used 
to be. . . . It hurt because here's a guy who has been here since I've been 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti doesn't figure to be hurting long. He's 27 for 30 in save 
opportunities, the market is expected to be open again, there's a vast need for 
proven relief pitchers and the Yankees themselves have no apparent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a hell of a year," Manager Stump Merrill said. "He just hasn't had 
the opportunities. I still have a lot of confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
After a summer of indoctrination, making moves designed to strengthen the 
marketing and minor league departments, the new president of the Detroit Tigers 
believes he is ready to take a more active role in the varsity's baseball 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bo Schembechler, the former Michigan football coach, to Danny Knobler of 
the Booth newspaper chain: "I hope you'll take this the right way, but I know 
more about what it takes to put a team together and compete than any other 
person in my position. Therefore, I'm going into the baseball end of it now 
more actively than any other club president." 
</P>
<P>
And why did he wait? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to jump in and talk about players I didn't know about," he said. 
"I've now watched a lot of games, studied baseball and stayed up late listening 
to ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was reported here last Sunday that the Cincinnati Reds were 
bidding to become the first team since introduction of the 162-game schedule in 
1961 to lead every day of the season. The Reds are bidding to become the first 
National League team. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Detroit Tigers opened 9-0, 18-2 and 35-5 in a wire-to-wire run during 
which they also never trailed the Kansas City Royals during the playoffs or the 
San Diego Padres during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Add Reds: Manager Lou Piniella reminded his team about the story of the 
tortoise and the hare and how the race goes to the steadiest, most consistent 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
Said pitcher Rick Mahler: "What I liked best is when Lou acted out the roles."

There were 45,474 fans on hand Saturday at Detroit for the American League 
version of Home Run Derby. They weren't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The best power hitters in the majors, Cecil Fielder, Jose Canseco and Mark 
McGwire, all hit prodigious home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder hit two and the Tigers beat the Athletics, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder's first homer against Dave Stewart (17-10) came with a man on and 
carried 440 feet into the left-center field seats at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With one runner on in the fourth inning, Fielder joined Harmon Killebrew and 
Frank Howard as the only players to hit a ball over the roof in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has a major league-leading 41 home runs and 108 runs batted in. 
Canseco, who hit a 450-foot home run, has 35, and McGwire, whose homer reached 
the upper deck, has 33. They hit consecutive homers off Frank Tanana in the 
first inning. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
CLEMENS PUTS SORENESS TO REST, WINS 19TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Roger Clemens started complaining in midseason that his pitching 
shoulder was tired. It brought about a decision by Boston Manager Joe Morgan 
that might mean a division title for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
It was decided that henceforth, Clemens would always get at least four days' 
rest between assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been sensational. 
</P>
<P>
With five days' rest, Clemens pitched a five-hitter Saturday at Toronto, 
beating the Blue Jays, 1-0, and increasing Boston's lead in the American League 
East to three games. 
</P>
<P>
Another well-rested player, Dwight Evans, hit his 12th home run in the seventh 
inning to beat David Wells (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
Evans, bothered all season by a back problem that is eased only by rest, had 
not played in five games. Before he homered, Evans had two singles. In eight 
innings, Wells gave up only two other hits. He left shortly after a line drive 
by Wade Boggs hit him in the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking it would be good to hit a home run for the way he was 
pitching," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The extra day's rest probably came in handy for Clemens in the ninth inning. An 
error by third baseman Boggs, a double by Fred McGriff and an intentional walk 
loaded the bases with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens then got Greg Myers on a fly ball to short right field and struck out 
Manny Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty comfortable once I got Myers," Clemens said. "I wasn't tired." 
</P>
<P>
It was Clemens' seventh consecutive victory and fourth shutout in the string. 
His record is 19-5. 
</P>
<P>
In seven starts beginning with a three-hit shutout at Milwaukee July 25, 
Clemens has pitched 58 1/3 innings out of a possible 63. He has given up 47 
hits, four earned runs, walked only six and struck out 56. 
</P>
<P>
"This game gave me the opportunity to pick the guys up and take the focus off 
them," Clemens said. "They've been picking it up for me all year. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it was against these guys, it was probably the best game I pitched." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, Kansas City 3 -- Ken Griffey Jr. singled to drive in the tiebreaking 
run in the seventh inning at Kansas City and Edgar Martinez stole home to end 
the Royals' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Buhner tied a major league record by striking out for the eight consecutive 
time. He had a two-run single in the sixth, then struck out two more times. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh inning, Storm Davis (7-9) walked Harold Reynolds 
and Martinez before Griffey singled to make it 4-3. Martinez went to third on a 
fly. Then he and Griffey worked a double steal, Martinez just beating the 
return throw home. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up 11 hits in 7 1/3 innings, Erik Hanson improved to 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 11, Baltimore 5 -- Jerry Browne had four hits, including a home run, 
and drove in four runs at Baltimore to lead an 18-hit assault. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 4-4 tie when Browne hit a two-run shot in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alomar also homered for the Indians, who dropped the Orioles 8 1/2 games 
behind Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Olin (2-4) pitched five scoreless innings of relief for his first victory 
since May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Devereaux had two hits and drove in three runs for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, New York 3 -- At New York, the Yankees led, 2-1, there were two on 
and two out in the ninth inning and bullpen ace Dave Righetti, a left-hander, 
was facing Greg Brock, a left-handed batter. 
</P>
<P>
Brock homered to win the game. The Brewers' Paul Molitor had three hits, 
extending his hitting streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Texas 5 -- Brian Harper had four hits and drove in two runs at 
Arlington, Tex., to help the Twins end their second nine-game losing streak 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins were behind, 4-1, after two innings and pulled even in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Harper singled with two out to score Dan Gladden from second 
base. They added two more in the eighth to end the losing streak. DAN HAFNER

Bobby Shannon's two-run homer in the fifth inning lifted Shippensburg, Pa., to 
a 5-4 victory over Cypress on Saturday, sending the Pennsylvania team into the 
championship game of the Little League World Series against Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
To clinch the victory, Shippensburg thwarted a no-out squeeze bunt in the 
bottom of the sixth and final inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Joe Katchka bunted with Eddie Zamora at third, Katchka was out at 
first and Zamora was tagged out as he dove for the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher David Orndorff struck out eight and drove in two runs for Shippensburg. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Orndorff beat out a two-hopper to shortstop, scoring Jimmy Smith 
to tie the score. Shannon hit the next pitch over the left-field fence to make 
it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrie Cordero homered in the fifth for Cypress, which had a 3-0 lead after two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Shippensburg will play Taiwan today. Taiwan advanced by defeating Trail 
(Canada), 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
The first-inning run snapped Taiwan's nine-game scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had sent 16 teams to Williamsport previously. Thirteen won titles.

<P>
Jimmy Connors had to default, but the real loser was the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Connors showed flashes of his old form Saturday in the $350,000 WCT Tournament 
of Champions at New York, winning the first set from Ivan Lendl, 6-3, before 
losing the second, 7-5, and then being forced to retire by cramps early in the 
third set of a rain-delayed quarterfinal match. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Connors said he will not play in his 21st consecutive Open this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would better for me not to play the Open due to the fact that I 
don't think I can go out there and play the kind of tennis necessary to give it 
an all-out effort," said Connors, a five-time Open champion whose streak will 
end second only to the 24 in a row played by Vic Seixas. From 1974 through 
1985, Connors reached the semifinals 12 consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
He has won a men's record 107 matches. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Lendl and Aaron Krickstein advanced to today's title match. 
Lendl defeated Leconte, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1, and Krickstein beat Emilio Sanchez 
of Spain, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, the No. 1 player in the world, moved into the final of a 
$250,000 tournament at Commack, N.Y., by winning two matches. First, he 
completed a rain-delayed, 6-4, 6-2 victory over fellow Swede Jonas Svensson. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he defeated John McEnroe, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia beat fourth-seeded Pete Sampras, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 
and Guy Forget of France, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, to advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Ramish Krishnan of India upset top-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina, 1-6, 6-3, 
7-5, to advance to the final of a $225,000 tournament at Schenectady, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
He'll meet Kelly Evernden in today's championship match. Evernden advanced by 
beating Brad Pearce, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's semifinals, Anke Huber of West Germany defeated Wiltrud Probst, 
also of West Germany, 6-2, 6-0, and Marianne Werdel defeated Mercedes Paz of 
Argentina, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.

Phil Mickelson and Manny Zerman played nearly bogey-free golf to win semifinal 
matches Saturday and set up an all-Arizona final in the U.S. Amateur 
championships. Mickelson, 20, of Arizona State, and Zerman, 20, of the 
University of Arizona, will battle in a 36-hole match for the title today at 
Cherry Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Recording three birdies and just one bogey -- on the opening hole -- Mickelson 
defeated David Eger of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., 5 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Zerman, who was born in South Africa and adopted by a family in San Diego, had 
three birdies and no bogeys in eliminating Tom Scherrer of Skaneateles, N.Y., 4 
and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson and Zerman have played countless times before, as teammates in high 
school in San Diego their senior years and as members of the same golf club, as 
well as in college matches. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time NCAA champion and the qualifying medalist in the championship, 
Mickelson remains the favorite. The long-hitting left-hander consistently 
reached the par-five holes in two shots and seemed to have recovered from some 
erratic putting that hampered him early in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, two rounds were scheduled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning quarterfinals, Mickelson birdied the 17th hole to edge Bob May 
of La Habra, 1-up. Mickelson hit a three-wood second shot 269 yards that rolled 
just over the island green and then chipped close. May's second shot went into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinals, Eger got past Mike Brannan of Trumbull, Conn., 2 and 1, 
in a battle of former touring pros who have been reinstated as amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Scherrer beat Hans Albertsson of Manchester, Vt., 3 and 2, and Zerman defeated 
Mike Sposa of Dillard, Ga., 3 and 2.

COURSES DESIGNED BY NICKLAUS HAVE INSIDE TRACK TO PRESTIGE RANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The modern-day shortcut to getting a golf course named one of the "100 best in 
America" would seem to be having Jack Nicklaus as its architect. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who has been at his second career only 15 years, designed seven 
courses among the top 100 in the latest rating by Golf Digest's panel of 
experts. Only four legendary designers -- Robert Trent Jones, Donald Ross, Pete 
Dye and A.W. Tillinghast -- have as many or more. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus' first signature course, Muirfield Village, which he created with 
Desmond Muirhead in Dublin, Ohio, heads the list, which also includes Shoal 
Creek, Ala.; Castle Pines, Colo.; Desert Highlands, Ariz.; Annandale, Miss.; 
Loxahatchee, Fla., and Grand Cypress, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
It may be only a matter of time before two of his jewels in Southern California 
break into the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood Country Club, which opened with great fanfare in the hills south of 
Thousand Oaks a year ago, and Dove Canyon Country Club, the newest addition to 
Orange County's golf explosion, are excellent future-book candidates. 
</P>
<P>
All they need is time, and with Nicklaus courses that sometimes doesn't take 
long. Loxahatchee, a watery layout in Jupiter, Fla., made the list only four 
years after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulty -- at least from the championship, or tournament, tees -- is always 
a consideration, and both Sherwood and Dove Canyon can be stretched out to 
torture tests. Sherwood, from the gold tees, was recently assigned a 75.7 
rating with a slope of 146, the fourth-highest in the Southern California Golf 
Assn. Dove Canyon has been tentatively set at 74.3 with a 136 slope, but it is 
expected to be 75 or higher when the official rating is assigned by the SCGA 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Both are centerpieces of exclusive master-planned, gate-guarded communities. 
Surrounding the Sherwood course is David Murdock's 1,900-acre development in 
the Sherwood Valley. Dove Canyon is an 874-acre development east of Mission 
Viejo, where Garth Chambers has carved out 1,312 homesites and a golf course 
between Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza, another golf course-oriented 
community where a Robert Trent Jones, Jr.-designed layout is the centerpiece. 
Dove Canyon is unique in that no smoking is allowed -- on the golf course -- 
because of its proximity to the Cleveland National Forest and its use of a 
straw-like fescue grass in the rough, which has given it a high fire-risk 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood was opened last November when Greg Norman played host to the Ronald 
McDonald Children's Charities tournament won by Curtis Strange. This year's 
event will be Nov. 13-18. 
</P>
<P>
The Dove Canyon course opened on Aug. 8, but the formal opening with Nicklaus 
on hand to hit the first ball will not be held until early next year, after the 
47,000-square foot clubhouse is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Pino, who was instrumental in forming the Los Coyotes and Friendly Hills 
country clubs and was later at the Los Angeles Country Club and Industry Hills, 
recently joined Dove Canyon as general manager. Kevin Paluch, formerly with 
Fairbanks Ranch Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe, is director of golf. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicklaus' attention to detail is amazing," Pino said. "When he came out for 
what was sort of a final inspection, he didn't like the way one fairway looked 
to him, so he had us move it 15 feet. The sprinkling system was already in, and 
we had to move the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The incident is similar to Nicklaus' work at Sherwood, where he didn't like the 
positioning of a 100-year-old oak tree on a hole; he simply had it dug up and 
moved to where he wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel and Betsy King will continue their duel for player-of-the-year 
honors on the LPGA Tour into the $325,000 MBS tournament next month at Los 
Coyotes Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, the earnings leader with $557,532 to date, and King, the U.S. Women's 
Open champion and winner of $421,431, have both filed entries for the 54-hole 
tournament Sept. 21-23, along with Nancy Lopez, the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Sheehan, the second-leading money winner with $537,791, is also expected 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino have committed to play in the inaugural Security 
Pacific Senior tournament Oct. 29-Nov. 4 at Rancho Park. Palmer won three Los 
Angeles Opens at Rancho in 1963, '66 and '67, but he is probably remembered 
more for the seven-over-par 12 he took on the ninth hole in 1961, when he hit 
four consecutive shots out of bounds -- two to the right and two to the left. 
The 54-hole $500,000 tournament will benefit the Centinela Hospital's

Jerry Barber, in his sixth decade as a professional golfer, is the oldest 
regular on the Senior PGA Tour at 74. The longtime Griffith Park pro from La 
Canada comments on the problems of keeping up with the 60-year-olds in the 
Vantage Super Seniors division: "The toughest thing I find is the way I've lost 
distance on my driving. The golf courses are getting a little too long for me, 
and they're calling for finer shots than I can make now. We could make those 
shots in days gone by, but not now. A lot of guys are coming in there with a 
seven- or an eight-iron, and I'm back there with a wood or long iron. It 
doesn't make for any kind of scoring."

Dates for the 20th annual L.A. City Senior Women's Championship have been 
changed to Sept. 5-6 at the Rancho Park course. . . . Bill Campbell, 1964 U.S.

Dey, named captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland.

MISERDEN FINDS THE DIRT IS GREENER, PAYS $68 FOR UPSET CABRILLO VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although it didn't seem possible, the $326,300 Cabrillo Handicap lived down to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
With Criminal Type, Quiet American, Lively One and Kansas City sitting it out 
for various reasons, the race looked more like a classified allowance contest. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the result, the Cabrillo would seem to be in danger of losing its 
Grade III status. 
</P>
<P>
Miserden, the longest shot in the field at 33-1 and the 111-pound lightweight, 
outfinished favored Notorious Pleasure to win by a half-length in 1:48 for the 
1 1/8 miles on the main track. 
</P>
<P>
Never better than fourth in five previous starts in the United States, the 
4-year-old Private Account colt hadn't won since Nov. 11, 1988, when he beat 
Louis Cyphre by a nose in a Group I race at St. Cloud in France. 
</P>
<P>
Providing David Flores with his biggest victory, Miserden, who returned $68, 
$20.40 and $10.80, was on or near the lead throughout and got the best of 
Notorious Pleasure, the 3-1 choice, in the final yards. Three lengths back was 
Bosphorus, who finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Charlatan III. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought this horse could run," trainer Bobby Frankel said. "Today, he 
proved it. I always thought he would be a better dirt runner than a turfer. The 
one other time I ran him on dirt (June 13 at Hollywood Park) he ran OK, but he 
needed the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried him on the grass, but I thought he'd go better when he got a chance to 
run back on dirt. I've had him the last four months. He trains good and acts 
good and he just figured to do good one of these days. This looked like a 
relatively easy race and I wanted to give him a chance to prove himself." 
</P>
<P>
In collecting his third victory in 12 lifetime starts, Miserden made Flores 
work for his first Del Mar stakes victory. The 22-year-old rider, who won a 
record 36 races during the recent 18-night Los Alamitos meeting, returned tired 
and perspiring heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lazy horse and I had to ask him after the five-eighths pole," he said. 
"Bobby told me to either go to the lead or to wait in second or third. It 
worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
Notorious Pleasure, who is probably a better horse on the turf, had no excuses, 
according to Laffit Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried," he said. "I thought I had the other horse two or three times, but 
he just never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
In his return to California, Aaron Gryder finished seventh aboard No Marker, 
the second choice. Perhaps, all the shipping the 6-year-old Grey Dawn II horse 
has done this year finally caught up with him. He had two victories and a 
second in his last three starts at three different tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was done about the three-eighths pole," said Gryder. "I felt like he was in 
the garden spot, but he just didn't have it today. But I can't complain about 
his performance. It's the first bad race he's run all year." 
</P>
<P>
Royal Reach, Chris McCarron's mount in the Cabrillo, finished last, but it was 
still a big day for the rider. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after returning after recovering from broken legs and a broken arm, 
McCarron won twice. He slipped through the slimmest of holes along the rail to 
take the sixth on 2-year-old maiden Magnificent Red, then returned in the ninth 
to win on $25,000 claimer Saucy Sam. 
</P>
<P>
In winning twice, the jockey equaled the output of Vann Belvoir, agent Scotty 
McClellan's client while McCarron was recuperating. A 16-year-old apprentice, 
Belvoir needed 89 mounts to do so and he returned to Longacres after riding 
here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like I broke my maiden all over," said McCarron, who was greeted with 
a warm ovation when he and Magnificent Red made their way into the winner's 
circle. "It was ironic that the horse I rode (Full Design) in the spill was for 
Mr. (John) Mabee (who owns Magnificent Red). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be in that tight and I brushed the fence. The ovation was 
wonderful. It made me feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, who almost certainly would have been favored in the $300,000 Del 
Mar Invitational Handicap a week from Monday, will miss the race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small splint, just below the knee on the cannon bone of her right 
foreleg," said trainer Ed Gregson. "X-rays were negative. It's very minor, but 
it will make us miss the race. She had been doing well." 
</P>
<P>
A 4-year-old filly, Petite Ile had worked seven furlongs in 1:24 2/5 a week ago 
today. She had won the Yerba Buena and Golden Gate Handicaps up north and 
Hollywood Park's closing-day Sunset. Gregson hopes to have her back for Oak 
Tree's Yellow Ribbon Invitational Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Another stakes winner, Iroquois Park, will be sidelined for at least two months 
after suffering a knee injury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A $235,000 yearling purchase, the Chief's Crown colt finished fourth as the 
even-money favorite in Wednesday's Balboa Stakes. "He has a slight stress 
fracture of the knee," said trainer Wayne Lukas, who owns the horse in 
partnership with Overbrook and Sugar Maple Farms. "He'll need 60-90 days of 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
At its regular monthly meeting Friday, the California Horse Racing Board 
approved trifecta wagering. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the trifecta, which requires a fan to pick the first three finishers in a 
race, must be reviewed by the Office of Administrative Law and filed with the 
secretary of state. There's a possibility the trifecta could be implemented 
sometime in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
There will be a full field of 12 3-year-old fillies in the $167,900 Del Mar 
Oaks today. Variety Spice was scratched from the the race, leaving room for one 
of the three also-eligibles to draw in. By the luck of the draw, Bel's Starlet 
is in the Oaks, meaning the Jack Munari-owned entry of Bimbo II and Native 
Twine won't be able to run if there are no further scratches. 
</P>
<P>
Bel's Starlet and Annual Reunion will race coupled and are owned by John Mabee, 
Del Mar's former president and a member of the Board of Directors. Besides 
Annual Reunion and Bel's Starlet, those scheduled to go in the Oaks, which will 
be run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf, are Fit To Scout, Adorable Emile, Interlope, 
Bidder Cream, Nijinsky's Lover, Freya Stark, Orlanova, Slew Of Pearls, As If 
and Cat's Air. . . . There is a Pick Six carryover for today of $176,542.

MUNICIPAL JUDGES GAIN 2 DISPARATE REPUTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: CRITICS SAY THE BENCH PENALIZES DEFENDANTS WHO GO TO TRIAL. THE 
JURISTS, WHO HANDLE ONE OF THE HEAVIEST CASELOADS IN THE STATE, DENY IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The 12 judges of the Ventura County Municipal Court often take flak for their 
rulings from critics who call them unfair, overly harsh and even capricious. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, an article in California magazine picked Judge John J. Hunter as 
one of the three most unfair and abusive judges in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Judge Arturo F. Gutierrez was criticized for delaying execution of a 
sentence for a convicted drunk driver who then allegedly killed a high school 
student in a drunk-driving accident. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, legal scholars dunned Judge Steven E. Hintz for letting a 
prosecutor serve as foreman of a jury that took 15 minutes to convict a man of 
being under the influence of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Ventura County Municipal Court has two reputations. 
</P>
<P>
One is that its judges are tough, vindictive men who penalize defendants with 
stiffer sentences for going to trial instead of pleading guilty. The unofficial 
slogan around the courthouse is: "Ventura County: Arrive on vacation, leave on 
probation." 
</P>
<P>
The other is that the judges are hard-working, competent and fair, handling 
more than 200,000 criminal, civil and traffic cases per year in the pressure 
cooker that an ever-increasing caseload has made of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ventura County's caseload per judge is among the highest in California, 
outranking even the crowded municipal courts of Los Angeles by nearly 40%. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988-1989 fiscal year, 16,797 cases were filed per judge in Ventura 
County Municipal Court, while 12,125 cases were filed per judge in the Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, according to the California Judicial Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Municipal Court handles all misdemeanors, traffic tickets 
and small claims cases, and arraigns felony defendants who are headed for 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday at the main Ventura County Courthouse and the courthouse in 
Simi Valley, one Municipal Court judge was meticulously working his way through 
a two-foot-thick stack of cases, another was sternly sentencing a third-time 
drunk driver to 120 days in jail and a third was patiently listening to the 
morning's 12th plea of "guilty with an explanation." 
</P>
<P>
On some days, the caseload can grow so heavy that judges are forced to handle 
nearly one case per minute. And sometimes defendants get little more than 
"assembly line justice," say prosecutors, defense attorneys and the court's own 
judges. "Assembly-line justice is a shocking and horrible way to have to 
describe it, but in today's times, it's far too often true," Judge Barry B. 
Klopfer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to, by the sheer volume of cases, deal with each as expeditiously and 
routinely . . . as possible while still trying as hard as we can to maintain a 
sense of the individuality of each case," Klopfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Klopfer's assignment is handling criminal trials, which he says is a little 
slower-paced than his last assignment, which ended in June when he was rotated 
out of the job of "master calendar" judge in charge of scheduling criminal 
cases for trial. 
</P>
<P>
"You start a day down there realizing that if every case that is on the 
calendar is to proceed to a jury trial, that that day's worth of cases could 
easily tie up the available trial courts for weeks," Klopfer said. 
</P>
<P>
"These judges are today just high-paid bureaucrats," Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury said. "They're one cog in this system that deals with a tremendous 
volume of cases and they're assembly-line workers. And to stay alive, they have 
to turn out 5,000 widgets a day. So what tends to be sacrificed is the quality 
of justice. . . . And frequently, the public goes away feeling they haven't had 
their day in court." 
</P>
<P>
And while the caseload increases steadily -- 999 cases were awaiting trial at 
the end of the 1988-89 fiscal year, up from 794 cases at the end of 1986-87 -- 
the court has not added a new judge's position since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have had 16 or 17 judges in this court for the past few years and 
obviously we don't," Presiding Municipal Court Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
"With seven trial divisions in this court, as a system we have the capacity to 
try 500 trials a year. There are nearly 13,000 cases set for trial," Cooper 
said. "There's gotta be some give . . . somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The system often "gives" before trial, during what judges call "early 
disposition." Without some flexibility in the disposition of cases, the 
Municipal Court would collapse, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bradbury refuses to let his prosecutors negotiate pleas with 
defendants, a higher percentage of cases go to trial in Ventura County than in 
any other county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In most counties, 5% to 7% of criminal cases go to trial. In Ventura County, 
12% to 15% go to trial, while the rest are "disposed of" through guilty pleas 
by the defendants or dismissals by the court or prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the Municipal Court judges penalize defendants for refusing to 
plead guilty and save the court the time and expense of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth Clayman said, "The judges like to 
demonstrate to you that if you go to trial and lose, you're going to do worse 
than if you plead out." A defendant who pleads out is basically entering a 
guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman quoted a joke making the rounds of the Ventura County Courthouse: in 
Municipal Court, "The three most heavily punished offenses are driving under 
the influence, being under the influence of heroin and trial by jury." 
</P>
<P>
Another defense attorney complained, "The court punishes people for having a 
trial . . . because if more people had trials here it would break the back of 
the system and there is no way they can afford to." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's no plea-bargaining policy prevents judges from letting defendants 
plead to lesser charges, said the attorney, who asked not to be identified. 
"They can only scare the defendant by showing that if he doesn't accept what 
the district attorney wants, they'll get more" time in jail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Phillip R. Dunn said giving stiffer sentences for people found 
guilty at trial is "extremely offensive. This is occurring with greater 
frequency than it used to . . . I think they have lots of reasons they state 
officially as to why they do this. But the truth is that they are trying to 
coerce people not to go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn cited a recent case in which his client chose to fight a first-offense 
drunk-driving charge in a trial because his blood-alcohol level was very close 
to the legal level. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy didn't even testify. All he did was require the people to prove their 
case against him," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was convicted. But instead of the standard sentence of probation and 
fines for a first offense, he was sentenced to six days in County Jail, Dunn 
said. Dunn said he was able to persuade the judge to reduce the penalty to a 
suspended six-month jail sentence, but the man will have to serve the sentence 
if he violates the terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
Judges and some attorneys vehemently deny the penalty-for-trial theory, saying 
critics have it backward. Instead, they say, defendants are rewarded with 
lighter sentences for pleading guilty than they would face if they went to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Judges often learn of aggravating evidence during trial, and sometimes boost 
the sentence accordingly, Judge Thomas Hutchins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Municipal Court bench "is extremely fair and scrupulous 
about making sure people don't get punished because they went to trial," said 
Hutchins, who is the newest Municipal Court judge in Ventura County, having 
been appointed from the district attorney's office 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said, "It's obvious that if the court is penalizing defendants for 
exercising their constitutional right to jury trials that that would be serious 
misconduct . . . I have heard that suggested before, but I don't have any 
evidence of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said, "A judge in a high-volume arraignment court does not have time to 
analyze each crime. That's a function of volume." 
</P>
<P>
He said of lighter sentences, "Most judges give the defendant the benefit of 
that in exchange for an early disposition . . . I think the perception that we 
penalize people for going to trial is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
And Cooper added, "One of the first steps in rehabilitation is to get a person 
to concede he's wrong and accept whatever penalty is imposed for wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and Klopfer also agreed that during trial judges often learn 
incriminating facts that would not have surfaced in a guilty plea. Those facts 
often prompt them to increase a defendant's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Many Ventura County lawyers also complain the Municipal Court bench is 
generally too harsh, too intent on jailing convicts to sentence them fairly or 
work toward rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend on occasion to be a little bit too severe in some of their 
sentencing," said James Farley, a defense attorney who works for a group of 
court-appointed lawyers called Conflict Defense Associates. 
</P>
<P>
He said judges in Los Angeles County often pass lighter sentences than they do 
in Ventura County. "I think they sometimes take pride in the fact that they are 
a tough bench, and I think that that sometimes creates problems in that one 
case . . . where punitive is not really the approach that should be taken," 
Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of appears that for the most cases they are interested more in jail 
time," said another veteran defense attorney, who asked not to be identified. 
"Some judges don't want to use the work-release program that was instituted by 
the Probation Department for minor, non-security risk-type offenders. . . . 
Everything for them is jail. They don't consider any of the alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said of the Municipal Court judges: "For many years, they have 
probably imposed the longest average sentences in California for 
driving-under-the-influence cases." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the court often sentences second-time drunk drivers to 30 days in 
jail, instead of the prescribed 48 hours. "Most are going to go in for 30 days 
because the consequence of a third offense is 120 days," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you have to do" to impress drunk drivers with the 
seriousness of their crimes -- and with the seriousness of repeated offenses, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers say the judges' penchant for tough sentences comes from the 
experience many of them gained while working as prosecutors in the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the judges are merely responding to the law-and-order atmosphere 
the county's residents expect them to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney George Eskin, who served as Ventura County's assistant 
district attorney in the late 1960s, said, "I think if they were as harsh and 
punitive across the board as they're made out to be, then the criminal justice 
system in Ventura County would come to a halt" because defense attorneys would 
take more cases to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is responsive to what it perceives as the public expectations of 
what the court system is supposed to be," Eskin said. "I have a feeling that if 
I were a judge that my sentences just generally would be consistent with what 
you see in Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Cooper said Municipal Court judges often are tougher sentencers 
than their city counterparts. "In Los Angeles, it's practically impossible to 
put people in jail on misdemeanors" because the county's jails are so crowded, 
he said. "You come here, it's a different reality." 
</P>
<P>
And Cooper cited a recent FBI report showing Ventura County to have the lowest 
crime rate of any heavily populated county in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Steepling his hands under his chin, Cooper leaned back and concluded, "Until 
someone can demonstrate to me there is not a causal relationship between what 
we do and the low crime rate, I'm prepared to indulge a perception that there 
is."

PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES PLAY KEY ROLE IN THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From the moment Sherry Ceccanese met him, she knew something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Ceccanese, a county public health nurse, had knocked on the door of the North 
Park apartment in search of another client. But the stranger who answered 
seemed to need help as well. He was recently widowed, he said, and was raising 
his two toddler sons alone. Look at them, he demanded -- weren't they doing 
great? 
</P>
<P>
Ceccanese didn't think so. The barely furnished apartment contained no toys 
other than a tiny piano that the children poked at listlessly when asked to 
play. One boy had a cleft lip in need of repair. But the man refused repeated 
offers of health services -- anything that Ceccanese couldn't do in the 
apartment, he didn't want done at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to wonder: Were these kids his?" said Ceccanese, who acted on her 
hunch and called the police. Soon, her suspicions were confirmed: the boys had 
been missing for a month, an officer told Ceccanese later, kidnaped from their 
Escondido home by their estranged father who was suspected of molesting them. 
Within hours, they were reunited with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Although hardly an every-day event, Ceccanese's story shows how unpredictable 
-- and how vital -- public health nurses' work can be. Providing free services 
in unfamiliar terrain, often speaking more than one language, these nurses meet 
patients on their own turf. They are not social workers -- they do not have the 
authority to mandate care. But the community is where they do their best work, 
combining teaching and detective work to help their clients stay well. 
</P>
<P>
When a teen-ager came down with malaria in Oceanside earlier this month, public 
health nurses visited the family to determine how the illness was contracted. 
When the county's measles epidemic hits new highs, it is PHNs, as Ceccanese and 
her colleagues are called, who sound the call to immunize San Diego's 
</P>
<P>
children. When a baby is born prematurely, these same nurses visit regularly 
with the parents, teaching them to watch for developmental delays. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling from downtown hotels to uptown condominiums, from houseboats in Point 
Loma to migrant camps in North County, PHNs are widely regarded as the county's 
front lines of disease detection and prevention. But every year around this 
time, many joke that, instead of measuring their clients' blood pressure, they 
are worried about their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Each budget year, public health nurses are always vulnerable to budget cuts, 
and even this year the budget is still unsettled," said Betty Ann Collins, San 
Diego County's chief public health nurse. "We never rest easy." 
</P>
<P>
As yet, it is unclear how much state funding San Diego County will receive this 
year, according to Bob Lerner, the county spokesman. But, regardless of the 
overall total, he said, a recent court order requiring the county to reduce 
jail crowding will mean even more belt-tightening than expected. On Sept. 11, 
the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to decide "what programs we abandon," 
Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
With the specter of cuts, PHNs are realistic about their chances. 
</P>
<P>
"When times are tight, money goes to the visible problem. Public health is 
oftentimes invisible," said Rose Marie Fox, one of the county's eight 
supervising public health nurses, who has heard the arguments against funding 
her programs. "They say, 'Look at all these people -- they're doing fine. They 
don't need you.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is the nature of the work: The more effective PHNs are, the more unnecessary 
they appear. Charged with teaching their patients how not to get sick, they 
often find their accomplishments difficult to measure. How do you estimate how 
many fewer drownings have occurred because of PHNs' parent safety lessons? Is 
it possible to quantify the neglect and abuse PHNs prevent by counseling 
troubled families? 
</P>
<P>
One thing, however, is easy to measure: San Diego's PHNs are spread thinner 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
In 1923, when 130 PHNs first ventured into county, they served roughly 112,000 
residents. Since then, as the county population has grown 20 times over, the 
public health nursing staff has been cut nearly in half. Today, 71 PHNs serve 
the county's 2.5 million residents, fielding more than 13,000 requests for 
services each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so few nurses to meet so many needs," said Collins, whose staff now 
limits its cases to those of highest priority -- mostly those related to 
mother-child health and communicable diseases. "However, almost everything we 
get is of a high priority -- a woman who has not had access to prenatal care, a 
premature infant, possibly a drug-exposed infant, the gamut of child abuse and 
neglect cases . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on, and Ceccanese, like each of her co-workers, seems to have 
seen them all. With 80 or so families on her caseload at all times, she meets 
psychotic mothers and retarded mothers, AIDS babies and crack babies. 
Recovering tuberculosis and measles patients are regular stops on her daily 
rounds -- a loop that takes her into the homes of wealthy businessmen and Navy 
wives, gang members and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
The job can be dangerous. Ceccanese has been confronted by bullying boyfriends. 
She has had clients who keep guns by the door, and been in one home where an 
acrid odor betrayed the presence of a methamphetamine lab. Twice, she has 
discovered 10-foot pet pythons slithering around the homes of newborn babies. 
</P>
<P>
Her experience is not unique. Another PHN dropped by a client's home 
unexpectedly and found the door ajar. When she stuck her head in and called the 
person's name, she was yanked into the room by a police officer. She had walked 
into the middle of a drug bust, and only her county ID badge pinned to her 
blouse convinced law enforcement officers that she wasn't a customer. 
</P>
<P>
Ceccanese acknowledges the risks -- she owns a canister of Mace and has an 
alarm and a steering wheel lock on her car. But she describes her career as 
rewarding, not frightening. Eleven years ago, when she made the decision to 
become a PHN, she had worked as a hospital nurse for five years -- an 
experience that left her well-trained, but frustrated. More often than not, she 
had been haunted by the feeling that she had reached the patient too late. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be taking care of a diabetic who just lost their foot, and I'd think, 'If 
I only could have found them earlier,' " she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Making the switch to preventive nursing had financial consequences. Although 
PHNs must have more training than registered nurses, they are usually paid 
less. 
</P>
<P>
At top scale, a San Diego County PHN makes less than $40,000 a year, according 
to Michele Molotsky, a union organizer at the California Nurses Assn., which is 
making a bid to represent the county's 400 nurses in collective bargaining. 
Since January, those nurses -- who include PHNs, juvenile hall nurses and 
mental health nurses, among others -- have been working without a contract, 
having rejected the county's offer of a 5% raise. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare the wages of San Diego nurses to those of other counties, and they're 
really inadequate," Molotsky said. "People count on the dedication they feel to 
their jobs. But it's very hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the PHN is charged with evaluating a client's environment as well as 
their illness -- what Fox calls "filling in the blanks" of a person's health 
profile. As PHNs get to know their patients, they find medical care is only 
part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (the patient) is required to take showers as part of their treatment. 
But do they have a shower? They may be living in a garage," Fox said. "Maybe 
for religious reasons, they don't want to take medicines. You don't find some 
of this out until you go into the home." 
</P>
<P>
Collins agreed, noting that the PHNs must often help people find other services 
before they can focus on their health. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real difficult to talk about the importance of bringing an infant in for 
immunizations when there's no food in the house," she said. "Before they're 
interested in following through with prevention, you've got to get them fed." 
</P>
<P>
So, as well as her baby scale and her files, Ceccanese also carries around a 
three-ring binder she calls her "resource book." Inside, she has compiled 
dozens of telephone numbers and brochures to help connect her clients to 
hospice care, on-the-job training programs and county welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
What she learns from one client she passes on to the next. One AIDS patient 
told her about Auntie Helen's, which provides laundry service to people with 
the deadly illness. When she next saw one of her families with an AIDS baby, 
she spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, she heard from the sister of one of her recovering 
tuberculosis patients. The woman said her brother, a legal immigrant from 
Honduras, had been mistakenly picked up by the Border Patrol and had no access 
to his medicine. Ceccanese got the man his pills, which make him noncontagious, 
and urged his sister to contact a lawyer, who was able to win his release. 
</P>
<P>
Ceccanese's clients say the best part about her visits is that she is generous 
with her time. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors always rush in, rush out," said Karen Henderson, whose 10-month-old 
daughter Rebecca was born two months premature. Henderson, whose neat apartment 
is filled with toys and baby pictures, is not lacking for medical care -- she 
has a pediatrician and, thanks to Ceccanese's networking, a physical therapist 
for her daughter. But it is in the privacy of her living room, she says, that 
she has learned the most about how best to care for her "preemie." 
</P>
<P>
"It was Sherry who taught me how to tell if she was dehydrated and who told me 
how much formula to feed her," Henderson said. "She's given me a good part of 
the information I need." 
</P>
<P>
"When she gets here, we talk her head off," said another woman who is 
recovering from tuberculosis and asked that her name not be used. Ceccanese's 
visits to her plush apartment overlooking Balboa Park have been a welcome 
alternative to her hurried doctor's appointments, she said. "When you know 
she's coming, you start thinking of all the questions you didn't get answered." 
</P>
<P>
What would be worst about budget cuts, PHNs say, is that they would have less 
time to spend answering such questions. 
</P>
<P>
"The basis of our jobs is trust," Fox said. "You don't develop trust by seeing 
someone once or twice." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else saves PHNs from extinction, Fox predicted grimly, their arch 
enemy will: infectious disease. Fewer PHNs translates into fewer soldiers in 
the fight to wipe out completely preventable illnesses like measles. This year 
alone, San Diego County has had about 900 measles cases -- one that resulted in 
the death of a 10-year-old boy. And if county health officials are serious 
about combating its spread, Fox said, they will have to turn to PHNs. 
</P>
<P>
"All you need is an epidemic" to remind people of the PHN's vital role, she 
said. "It's awful, but it's true."

MARINES ASKING FOR TIGHT LIPS; 
</P>
<P>
DEPLOYMENT: SECRECY REQUEST BY SENIOR OFFICERS AT CAMP PENDLETON IS CAUSING 
RESENTMENT AMONG SOME SPOUSES AND TENSION WITH THE MEDIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As U.S. Marines await possible combat in the Middle East, an emotional shadow 
war over how much information is released to the public and military families 
has broken out on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing Iraqi-sponsored terrorism and sounding under siege, Camp Pendleton has 
issued a blunt statement to Marine families advising them -- despite their 
anxiety over the safety of their loved ones -- not to comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"The command is doing what it can to keep the media outside the gate, but we 
cannot control them out in town," the declaration said. 
</P>
<P>
It complained that "currently the newspapers are plastered with quotes of 
Marines and their dependents discussing troop movements, giving times, dates 
and destinations." 
</P>
<P>
The military's effort to hold tight control over information, even though 
there's no mystery where America's forces are massing, has angered the wives of 
some servicemen and reawakened some lingering hostility between the military 
and the media from the Vietnam War days. 
</P>
<P>
The pregnant wife of a Navy corpsman stationed at Camp Pendleton and now 
deployed to the Middle East said, "They don't tell the wives anything except, 
'We have support groups' " to counsel wives on base. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a phone number, so I wait for him to call me," said the 
20-year-old woman, married nearly two years and expecting a baby in November. 
"He's been 
</P>
<P>
overseas before, but it's the fear of not knowing when he's coming home, if 
he's coming home." 
</P>
<P>
Many wives have said they only learn about the more specific whereabouts of 
their men from news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 7, shortly after deployment of U.S. troops began, Camp Pendleton and 
neighboring communities were buzzing with reports that Marines were heading for 
Middle East duty. 
</P>
<P>
The base refused to confirm or deny the deployment and told the press to attend 
a news conference the next day that would explain activity at the base. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the Marine Corps' commandant, Gen. A.M. Gray, told of no 
activity. In fact, he said that Camp Pendleton Marines were not on any special 
alert status and that it had not been decided whether any of them would be 
deployed to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to just wait and see how the various diplomatic and economic options 
fare here and see what transpires," he said. Yet, that same day, wives and 
mothers of Camp Pendleton Marines were telling the press that servicemen 
already had been deployed. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 11, when comments from families, local day-care operators and 
businesses already had made it clear the Marines were being deployed, Camp 
Pendleton acknowledged what everybody knew, that its Marines were shipping out. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the base has not only abandoned its silence, but has mounted a 
virtual public relations offensive. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, Camp Pendleton has invited the news media on base eight 
times to cover usually staged events such as Marines practicing riflery and the 
Middle East deployment's impact on the base post office. 
</P>
<P>
Such carefully orchestrated events, with controlled interviews, are designed to 
reassure the public that its armed forces are ready to feed the media's 
appetite for timely stories on Marines. 
</P>
<P>
During one Marine-supervised media tour on base to watch infantry training, 
Master Sgt. George Spear of the base's public affairs office said, "We hope 
this will give you what you need." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he noted, "I know there's a need for something visual" -- photo 
opportunities for television cameramen and newspaper photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the military is treating the Middle East situation as war, and worries 
that the media attention will increase the possibility of terrorist reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
A well-placed Marine, asking not to be identified, said the concern over 
terrorism is real at Camp Pendleton, although it is publicly downplayed to 
avoid an overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is concern that (terrorism) might be in the game plan," the source said. 
"We're concerned somebody will be a target. We learned a tough lesson with the 
Beirut bombing." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, 241 Marines were killed when a terrorist truck laden with explosives 
smashed into their barracks in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
No actual intelligence indicates that Camp Pendleton is a target, sources said, 
but the base is in a "heightened state of awareness." 
</P>
<P>
What that heightened state involves is unclear, although so far it is known 
that military police have been instructed to be alert for intruding news 
reporters while the public is still at liberty to take self-guided tours. 
</P>
<P>
Is the fear of terrorist violence legitimate? 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a danger of terrorism, but not greatly in the United States. 
It takes a great deal of planning and logistics," said David Isenberg, a 
research analyst for the non-government Center for Defense Information in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg figures the possibility of terrorism is greater in Europe, where "I 
think Iraq has more capability to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he noted that fearful memories remain, including the unsolved 1988 San 
Diego explosion of the van driven by the wife of Capt. Will Rogers, skipper of 
the guided missile Vincennes. The Vincennes mistakingly shot down an Iranian 
jetliner loaded with civilians over the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Another recollection comes from Gale Stienon, a retired Marine lieutenant 
colonel who handled public affairs at Camp Pendleton during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
She said families of service personnel have been vulnerable before, as when 
"Vietnam war demonstrators went to the homes of servicemen overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the press, though, many families and friends of American troops 
passionately object to being kept in the dark about many aspects of the Middle 
East deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many mothers, grandparents and kids I've had to hold in 
my arms and (let) cry," because they didn't know where the servicemen were 
going and when they might be back, said Dee Nelson, who runs a day-care and 
preschool center in Fallbrook. Many of the children there come from Marine 
families. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old Fallbrook woman who asked that her last name not be used, has 
been married to a Marine lance corporal for five years, has two children, and 
is troubled by not having enough information about his situation to make 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got any idea how long my husband is going to be away. Right now we 
don't know whether we'll stay here in California or go home to Illinois," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The military community's debate over information and secrecy has quickly found 
its way into the base newspaper, The Scout. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to the editor written by Cris Fraser, who said her boyfriend is in the 
Air Force, took umbrage with a commentary by a Marine gunnery sergeant that 
operational security is imperiled by military people and dependents talking to 
the news media and aloud in public. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser wrote: "The whole world already knows the United States has troops in 
the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, and we have more going over there." 
</P>
<P>
Dependents, she opined, talk about the crisis to console each other and handle 
the stress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about things that are not already plastered across the 
front pages of countless newspapers. We do not talk about tactical combat 
maneuvers, plans or embarkation points. We do not know any of that." 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton declined a request by The Times to interview ranking Marine 
officers about policies governing information for Marine families and the 
public. Although basic policy is set by the Department of Defense, military 
sources say individual commands have some flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's clear that the corps takes a dim view of the flurry of news stories 
and the family members who make unauthorized comments. 
</P>
<P>
Former public affairs officer Stienon said of Marine wives, "I think they do 
know what they need to know." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Mitchell, a retired Marine major who handled Camp Pendleton public 
affairs in the early 1960s, added that the excitement of events has simply 
overwhelmed many younger wives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something they've never experienced. They're not prepared for it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's looking for a story," said Lt. Cmdr. Jeffrey Smallwood, public 
affairs officer with Commander Naval Surface Force U.S. Pacific Fleet. "You've 
got so much going on in the ether, we want to keep names out of there." 
</P>
<P>
He faulted coverage of upset wives and families, saying "there are so many 
examples of dependents wringing their hands. It's emotion, it's style over 
substance." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the the military's concern is its memory of the role played by the 
American news media during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg, of the Center for Defense Information, said the military learned 
painfully from Vietnam that conflict "cannot be sustained without the support 
of the public." 
</P>
<P>
To the military's horror, Vietnam "showed the ability to bring about huge 
amounts of information from the field. Ever since then, (military operations) 
have been accompanied by a huge demand for information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers still resent the media coverage of Vietnam, believing it eroded public 
support and contributed largely to the war being lost. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg said the relationship between military and media "is one of resigned 
suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
Said one military source who knows Commandant Gray, the officer who said no 
decision had been made about sending Camp Pendleton Marines when some already 
had been deployed, "Gen. Gray doesn't give a damn about the media. . . . I 
think a lot of it's related to Vietnam."

MARCHERS HOLD CANDLELIGHT VIGIL FOR BOY KILLED BY GANG MEMBER'S GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They lighted the candles for Adrian Barajas well before sunset, and some were 
still glowing long after dark. They began with not more than 60 marchers, but 
their numbers grew to nearly 200 by the time his memorial was over at Dana 
Strand Village in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
And after the marchers had finished walking through the housing project where 
Adrian died, the mother of the shy 10-year-old guessed that he would have been 
honored by the crowd and its cause. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was going to make a ruckus," Odette Fortier said, managing a smile, 
"he'd want it to be for a good reason." 
</P>
<P>
The reason, for Fortier and the others, was fighting gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the young boy who loved art and music and hated gangs and 
violence was playing at his cousin's apartment at the Dana Strand housing 
project. There, on a quiet Saturday afternoon, the two boys found a gun 
belonging to his cousin's older brother, a gang member. As the boys passed the 
.357-magnum back and forth, it went off, killing Adrian. 
</P>
<P>
Though his death was officially considered an accident by police, Adrian's 
family and friends, gang specialists and community activists blame it on the 
gang violence that has become epidemic in parts of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
At Dana Strand and elsewhere, drive-by shootings have been, at times, almost a 
daily occurrence. And, even when the shooting stops, many in the community 
merely hold their breath, convinced that their reprieve from the killing will 
not last long. 
</P>
<P>
But Adrian's death, as evidenced by Friday night's march, has galvanized many 
in the community to confront the violence, which too often claims innocent 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The march, which lasted more than an hour, was sponsored by the Los Angeles 
City Housing Authority and Mothers Against Gangs Support Services, a 
Wilmington-based group whose members have children in gangs or who have lost 
children in gang violence. In addition, Los Angeles police, the Community Youth 
Gang Services Project, the Community Reclamation Project and others supported 
the march, representing what several participants said was an unprecedented 
coalition of agencies and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard what had happened to Adrian, I felt so helpless. I didn't want 
the boy to die in vain," said Gil Contreras, the housing authority's gang 
intervention coordinator credited with the idea behind the march. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted us to hopefully learn something. To bring people together. To say, 
'This is enough. Now it's time to start the healing,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The march began with tributes to Adrian and prayers for the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved my son and I hope that this and anything else anyone can do will stop 
the violence and the anger and the things that are devastating our community," 
Adrian's mother tearfully told the marchers, most of whom never knew her son. 
</P>
<P>
"If my loss serves a purpose to save only one child, I will be consoled," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord, use him as an example of all the violence," said the Rev. Gale 
Wigginton, pastor of Mountain Movers Church in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of seeing our children lost," Wigginton said. "We're tired of 
seeing them die. And we're going to do something about it because little things 
can become big things." 
</P>
<P>
As the marchers set out along Hawaiian Avenue toward C Street, their numbers 
began to grow. While most residents of Dana Strand and the surrounding 
neighborhood looked on, many joined the vigil. So did a few gang members, 
according to gang counselors who say the youths have been quietly mourning the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been saying it was an accident and they're sorry it happened, but they 
don't express themselves out loud too much," said Art Zepeda, a crisis 
intervention worker with Community Youth Gang Services. 
</P>
<P>
Added Joe Alarcon, field supervisor for the gang prevention program: "It's a 
real sad situation, but he died because of the guns . . . and when this 
happens, we try to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
As the marchers moved toward the center of Dana Strand, groups of young 
children, drawn by the crowd and the candles, asked why the people were there. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" one young boy asked another youngster holding a candle. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone died," the young marcher said. "This is like a parade. Like a quiet 
parade." 
</P>
<P>
Among the youngsters in the crowd were two friends of Adrian, who lived just a 
few blocks away from Dana Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"He was my best, best friend," said Arturo Martinez, 13, who lived a few doors 
down from Adrian and remembered how the two of them would play. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss him," said another young friend, Sandra Ochoa, 7. "He played kick ball 
with us . . . and my mom used to sometimes make him enchiladas. He loved 
enchiladas." 
</P>
<P>
When the hourlong march was over, the crowd met again in a parking lot across 
from Dana Strand. There, Adrian's mother once again thanked the marchers. Then 
she thought about her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I was picturing him up in heaven," she said, "smiling and being warm." 
</P>
<P>
In the next week or so, another tribute will be held for Adrian at Hawaiian 
Avenue Elementary School in Wilmington. There, on a corner of the playground, 
his classmates will plant a tree.

REAGAN GIVES A BOOST TO SALOMON'S CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE FORMER PRESIDENT ENTERS A DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD TO HELP RAISE 
$40,000 FOR REP. ANTHONY BEILENSON'S OPPONENT. BUT THE ASSOCIATION MAY BE A 
MIXED BLESSING. 
</P>

<P>
The Westside and San Fernando Valley congressional district of Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson is generally liberal, Jewish, and Democratic -- tough turf if you're 
a Republican challenger. 
</P>
<P>
But those political facts of life did not deter the district's most prominent 
Republican, a fellow from Bel-Air named Ronald Reagan, from venturing back into 
the political arena on behalf of GOP congressional candidate Jim Salomon. 
</P>
<P>
At a private fund-raising reception Thursday in Century City, the former 
President endorsed Salomon, a young Beverly Hills trade consultant who is 
waging his second uphill battle against Beilenson, a seven-term Democratic 
lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of Reagan at a closed-door $1,000-per-person gathering in the 
posh J.W. Marriott Hotel provided a $40,000 shot in the arm to the Salomon 
campaign, which had been running at a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the former chief executive spoke briefly of 
"the importance of electing people like Jim Salomon to Congress" and hoped that 
Salomon "becomes his congressman." The ex-President asked the select group of 
contributors to continue their efforts on Salomon's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusive event served notice that Reagan intends to play a role in the 
contest. Salomon said Reagan also has offered to appear in his campaign 
commercials on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
But the association with Reagan could prove a mixed blessing for Salomon, who 
has taken pains not to mention in campaign signs and billboards that he's a 
Republican running in Democratic territory. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers tell why: Beilenson crushed Salomon's first challenge in 1988 by a 
2-1 margin. Voters in the 23rd Congressional District also supported Democrat 
Michael Dukakis over George Bush in the 1988 presidential race. (They did, 
however, abandon their traditional Democratic allegiance in the 1984 Reagan 
landslide over Walter Mondale.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Salomon denies it, insiders in both parties suggest that the 
challenger's goal this year is to improve on his 1988 showing and build 
recognition with an eye on 1992, when congressional districts will have been 
redrawn to reflect the recent census. 
</P>
<P>
The highly politicized redistricting process is not expected to benefit 
Beilenson, whose independence has often irritated some of his influential 
Democratic colleagues -- particularly Reps. Howard Berman of Panorama City and 
Henry Waxman of Los Angeles, who are expected to play a leading role in drawing 
the new district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under this scenario, some of the liberal Westside precincts that are 
Beilenson's home base would be stripped away from his district, replaced by 
more Republican and conservative precincts in the corners of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1990 it's still a Democratic district, and Salomon acknowledged in an 
interview that he has to present his Republican support "very carefully -- so 
it doesn't give some people the impression I'm a lock-step Republican." 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign, Salomon has tried to portray himself as a new breed -- a 
moderate on some social issues, including abortion rights, political reform and 
environmental protection, and a conservative on others, such as crime and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's campaign consultant, Craig Miller, said Reagan's involvement raises 
the question: "Who is Jim Salomon? Is he progressive and forward-thinking or 
does he embrace the ultraconservative politics of Ronald Reagan?" 
</P>
<P>
Salomon said he wants to be judged solely on the basis of his positions on 
issues, not by political party labels. He said Reagan did not require a litmus 
test on issues. And Salomon pointedly noted he supports a woman's right to an 
abortion, which Reagan opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson was on vacation in Maine and could not be reached for comment, but 
Miller expressed confidence that Reagan will have no impact on the outcome of 
the congressional race this November. "Ronald Reagan did not have long 
coattails when he was in office and he will have no coattails out of office," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
While the impact of Reagan at the polls remains to be seen, the former 
President's appearance clearly helped Salomon in one respect -- raising money. 
</P>
<P>
Although he raised and spent far more than Beilenson in the past year and a 
half, Salomon's campaign treasury was all but empty at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission 
show the 34-year-old candidate's campaign had just $5,754 in cash on hand and 
had $20,061 in debts on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Salomon raised $69,844 and spent $147,683 on 
campaign consultants, computer programs, telephone bills, fund-raising and 
printing. He said the campaign has developed an extensive database of all 
registered voters in the district and is operating phone banks to shore up 
Republican support, before turning its attention to contacting independents and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tough 2 1/2 months ahead of us," Salomon said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Reagan's appearance will lend the campaign credibility by 
suggesting to potential contributors that the race is viable despite the odds. 
He noted that he has recruited nearly 300 campaign co-chairmen who have pledged 
to assist in his fund raising. Salomon's largest campaign contribution, $4,950, 
came from the National Rifle Assn. He also received $2,500 from Arco's 
political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Beilenson had $72,637 in the bank at the end of June. Faced with 
Salomon's aggressive fund-raising efforts, the 57-year-old lawmaker last year 
abandoned his usual practice of not raising campaign funds in non-election 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson collected $94,929 in 1989. His largest contributions last year came 
from Walt Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells, who gave $2,000. The veteran 
lawmaker is the only member of Congress from California who does not accept 
contributions from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Beilenson held no fund-raisers and received 
just $3,235. However, a major fund-raising event is planned for early October 
in Beverly Hills. Beilenson spent $9,283 in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Beilenson expects to be outspent, but argues that the lawmaker's 
long record as a state assemblyman, senator and then as a congressman will 
provide "durable support that money simply can't buy." 
</P>
<P>
In a preview of the coming campaign, Miller said Beilenson will run on his 
record of service and independent leadership. Like most challengers, Salomon 
will argue the incumbent is out of touch with his constituents. Peace and 
Freedom Party candidate John Honigsfeld will also be on the ballot.

BOARD CHOOSES NEW PRINCIPAL FOR HAWTHORNE HIGH SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: RACIAL TENSIONS IN CENTINELA VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT REMAIN EVIDENT 
AS TRUSTEES NAME THE INTERIM REPLACEMENT FOR KEN CROWE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Racial divisions remained firmly drawn in the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District Thursday night as trustees chose the interim successor for a 
controversial black principal amid continuing allegations by some residents 
that the district has not treated blacks fairly. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees, who had demoted Kenneth Crowe as principal at Hawthorne High School, 
replaced him with John Carter, the white vice principal of the district's adult 
school and an 18-year veteran of the district. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor of the meeting, the first since trustees fired Supt. McKinley Nash 
last month, suggested that the turmoil that beset the district in the 1989-90 
school year has endured the summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Stennis Floyd, an outspoken black parent, turned his back to the 
school board as he criticized the trustees from the podium. That prompted a 
group of whites, who were seated in the board room, to turn around in their 
seats so their backs were to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the community, incoming Supt. Tom Barkelew fluctuated between 
conciliatory language aimed at easing racial tensions, and attacks on board 
critics, whom he called "evil persons who conspired to do bad things to good 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Barkelew, 67, is a retired Centinela Valley superintendent who was brought back 
to replace Nash, a black administrator who frequently clashed with the school 
board. Barkelew, who is white, said many parents of incoming freshmen are 
afraid to allow their children into the district, which has been torn in the 
last year by a two-day student walkout, racial accusations and the dismissals 
of Nash and Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
Barkelew, said he has advised the parents to give the district one month and if 
their fears of further outbreaks prove true, he will allow them to transfer 
their children to another district. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tremendous job to do," Barkelew said, adding that outsiders "think 
we live in a jungle -- and we don't." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, trustees dispensed quickly with new business and spent the rest 
of the time listening to a barrage of criticism from both black and white 
residents, who criticized Nash's firing and a district press release that 
referred to some board critics as "conspirators." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Johnson, the president of the Inglewood-South Bay branch of the NAACP, 
said her organization has not participated in any conspiracy and takes issue 
with such an accusation. She said the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People remains concerned that racial discrimination is not being 
aggressively investigated in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Your time is limited," she told the board, made up of four Latinos and one 
Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
In the press release issued earlier this week, Barkelew said the district has 
"evidence of a conspiracy to discredit the Board of Trustees in order to 
undermine the orderly operation of the district." 
</P>
<P>
The release also took issue with what Barkelew termed an "intrusion" by outside 
elected politicians, apparently referring to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) and U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton). The release said the 
elected officials had hampered the board's efforts to address racial tensions 
in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the March student walkouts, Watson organized a community 
group that came up with a 10-point plan to ease tensions, and Dymally sent an 
aide to the district to talk with district officials and community members. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued earlier this week, Watson said she was invited into the 
dispute by Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth after students spilled out into city 
streets during a walkout at Leuzinger High School. 
</P>
<P>
She said community members remain frustrated that the board refuses to discuss 
its dismissals of Nash and Crowe. Crowe has since been hired as principal of 
Inglewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed that the board has further inflamed community division by 
terminating Dr. McKinley Nash and by dismissing student concerns about racism 
by insisting that student demonstrations were incited by adults," Watson said 
in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"For the superintendent to say that we were inciting this thing is totally 
untrue," said Kenneth Orduna, Dymally's chief of staff. "We were invited and we 
were trying to be conciliators. We were trying to help the school board, 
administrators and parents find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rancor at Thursday's meeting, board President Ruth Morales said she 
is looking forward to the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
Board members have received more than 800 letters of support and additional 
phone calls, Morales said, prompting applause from the majority of the roughly 
100 audience members.

PENINSULA'S ASIANS SLOW TO TURN NUMBERS INTO CLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ASIANS MAKE UP A GROWING SHARE OF THE POPULATION OF THE PALOS VERDES 
PENINSULA. BUT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, LANGUAGE AND CITIZENSHIP KEEP ALL BUT A

When Teresa Sun decided last year to seek a seat on the Palos Verdes Library 
District Board of Trustees, she knew that East and West would collide. 
</P>
<P>
Sun, who was born in China and came to the United States in 1959, expected to 
receive votes from the Asian community on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. But she 
also knew that American-style politics could offend and alienate those 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Although American politicians are expected to seek donations from supporters 
and portray themselves in glowing terms, asking friends for money and bragging 
about yourself are frowned upon in Asian culture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
So Sun carefully avoided both. To keep her candidacy low key, she also decided 
to forgo a kick-off party to announce her bid for office, and she limited her 
campaign committee to just one person, a treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"My style looked like a very Asian one," said Sun, who was elected to a 
four-year term on the library board. 
</P>
<P>
Sun and others say cultural differences can discourage Asians from becoming 
involved in local politics. Sun, for example, is the first Asian to be elected 
to public office on the peninsula, even though Asians constitute the largest 
minority group in the community. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Asians are represented in city government in the South Bay. For 
example, in Gardena, which Japanese farmers helped settle and where about 30% 
of the population is Asian, Mas Fukai and Paul Tsukahara have long served as 
council members. In Torrance, George Nakano has served on the council since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation is markedly different on the peninsula, even though Asians 
are expected to account for about 14% of the population there by 1997, almost 
double the percentage in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
No Asian is on the city council in any of the peninsula's four cities. No 
Asians serve on the school board. None are planning commissioners, appointed 
posts that often serve as a steppingstone to a council seat. 
</P>
<P>
Sun and others cite various reasons. Asians are still only a small percentage 
of the peninsula's population, they say. And, unlike the case in Gardena, many 
Asians on the peninsula are relative newcomers to the United States who may 
find the democratic process unfamiliar or intimidating. Others, especially 
those who work for Japanese-based companies, are resident aliens, not U.S. 
citizens, and are unable to vote or hold office. 
</P>
<P>
"(If) they don't have voting rights, they are not going to be active," said 
Angie Ma Wong, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident who conducts seminars on Asian 
values and culture for business and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Many Asians say cultural and other barriers also slow their assimilation into 
public life. The most obvious is language, they say. Others include a 
traditional mistrust of politics, a tendency to focus on family life instead of 
volunteerism, and the transient lifestyle of Japanese residents who have been 
assigned by their employers to work temporarily in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think more and more there may be a push to have an Asian representative (in 
some offices), but I think it will take a little while still," said Linda 
Moriwaki, who for the past two years has served on the board of the Peninsula 
Educational Foundation, a group that raises money for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Although 1990 census information is not yet available, Asians are expected to 
constitute 13.75% of the peninsula's population by 1997, compared to 7.6% in 
1980, according to a study recently commissioned by the library district. 
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District show 
that during the last school year, about 27% of the district's 8,938 students 
were of Asian descent. Among students who spoke limited or no English, 495 were 
Japanese, up from 238 in 1983; 171 were Chinese, up from 156, and 158 were 
Korean, up from 57. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the large number of Japanese students is the influx of 
Japanese business people who have been transferred to the area by their 
companies. Many live on the peninsula for three to five years before being 
reassigned to other cities or moved back to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Miyo Fujimoto, whose husband is a vice president for a Japanese corporation, 
said her family moved to Rancho Palos Verdes five years ago. Fujimoto said she 
and her husband hope to stay in the United States until their daughter 
graduates from Rolling Hills High School in two years, but are uncertain 
whether they will be able to. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't (have) a definite plan," said Fujimoto, who works as a 
volunteer with school district instructors assigned to teach English to 
Japanese children. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty that such families face may make them feel like outsiders in 
the community, some Asians say. And even if they wanted to get involved in 
local politics, by seeking a city council seat for example, they could not 
because they are not citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"They are pretty much transient; there is no permanence," Moriwaki said. "Their 
basic feeling is that they are in a host country." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Baszile, who co-chairs the multicultural committee of the Community Assn. 
of the Peninsula, a group that works to identify cultural and other needs in 
the community, said language poses a major challenge in getting Asians involved 
in local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a real impediment," Baszile said. "They would like to be more active in 
the community, but the language barrier is a factor." 
</P>
<P>
She said the committee, which encouraged Sun to seek a seat on the library 
district board, has had success in getting Asian mothers involved in school 
affairs. Baszile said such volunteer efforts are important if the presence of 
Asians in local government is to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that over the years," she said, "most people who have functioned (in 
city government) in Palos Verdes have not necessarily been from an old boys' 
network but people highly visible in the volunteer community. . . . Since Palos 
Verdes functions on volunteer time, those would be the first people 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
Although many Asians and Asian-based companies with ties to the Los Angeles 
area donate generous amounts of time and money to local causes and 
organizations, the ethic of volunteerism is not as strong in traditional Asian 
cultures as it is in the United States, Baszile and others say. 
</P>
<P>
Tsukahara, a Gardena city councilman since 1980, said that in Japan, large 
corporations or the government are expected to assume a large role in such 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Chu, mayor of Monterey Park in the San Gabriel Valley -- a city where 
Asians are 51% of the population -- said the lack of volunteer involvement in 
the Asian culture is especially evident in the education system. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency for people in Asia (to think) the school will take care of 
everything," said Chu, a former teacher of Asian studies at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Chu and others said a factor that may work to slow Asian involvement in local 
government is a traditional distrust of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"In Asia," she said, "I think a lot of people are taught to stay away from 
politics. . . . I think, generally speaking, the whole electoral process runs 
against Asian values. You are not supposed to sit around and talk about 
yourself, and you are supposed to be humble and rely on yourself to survive." 
</P>
<P>
William Chang, a Palos Verdes Estates resident who is president of the 
California chapter of the Asian American Republican National Assn., said, "Back 
home in Asia, in most countries usually just one party dominates the country, 
and if you join the wrong party you are in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
However, Chang and others said there are signs that Asians are becoming much 
more involved in the political process. He said he doesn't encounter the same 
amount of resistance that he did 10 or 15 years ago when he approaches someone 
about getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's election should prove to other Asians that they can be successful in 
political life, Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "Asians by nature are still adapting to the modern democratic 
system."

<P>
A Santa Clarita man drowned Saturday afternoon after falling into a swimming 
pool at the condominium complex where he lived, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Morris, 27, was standing beside the pool in the 24300 block of Venturi 
Drive when he suffered a seizure about 12:30 p.m. and fell in, said Lt. Don 
Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Morris was alone at the pool, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and sheriff's deputies arrived at the Lakeshore Condominiums pool 
and tried to revive Morris, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

HOW SAFE IS SAFE? CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ON AUTO, PLANE TRIPS QUESTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: A CONTROVERSIAL GM STUDY CLAIMS THAT CAR TRAVEL CAN POSE LESS 
RISK OF DEATH. THE RESULTS APPLY ONLY TO SOME DRIVERS AND VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Compared to the highway, the sky is supposed to be a friendly place. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of being killed on the average plane trip, statistics traditionally 
have told us, is about 1/20th that of being killed on the highway. As flight 
attendants are fond of telling passengers, the most dangerous part of their 
trip is the drive to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
But according to a new study in the journal Risk Analysis, those statistics 
tell only part of the story. Under certain conditions, the study asserts, many 
Americans are not more likely to survive in the air at all. In fact, for trips 
up to 600 miles long, they may be better off in a car. 
</P>
<P>
The findings carry a daunting list of caveats and assumptions. For one thing, 
the figures apply only to dying, and do not count the risk of nonfatal injury, 
which all concede is much higher in a car. Moreover, the results pertain only 
to certain types of drivers traveling in certain types of cars on only the 
safest kind of highways. 
</P>
<P>
But the study -- conducted by three statisticians at General Motors led by 
Leonard Evans -- flies so resolutely in the face of conventional wisdom that it 
has generated a wave of controversy among risk assessment experts. It also 
serves as a compelling illustration of why the statistics that shape human 
behavior can sometimes be highly misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Evans's analysis is based on a simple observation about the differences between 
the risks of airline travel and highway travel. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of being killed in a plane crash -- 0.55 fatalities per billion 
passenger miles flown -- is borne almost equally by everyone on the aircraft. 
There are few ways for a passenger to improve the chance of living. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the comparable fatality rate for drivers -- 12.56, nearly 23 
times as high -- is typically calculated as an average, lumping high-risk 
travelers -- teen-agers, madcap lane-changers and drunks -- with middle-aged 
accountants with four children in a large station wagon who drive so carefully 
they never so much as nick a fender. 
</P>
<P>
The drunk's risk of dying is much higher than the average and the accountant's 
is much less. 
</P>
<P>
What Evans argues is that for safe drivers the chances of being killed in a car 
accident are less than the chance of dying in a plane crash -- even if the 
assessments of average risk show the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the effect various factors have on the risks of driving: 
</P>
<P>
* Age: Eighteen-year-olds are about five times as likely to die in a car 
accident as is the average driver. A 40-year-old, by contrast, has a death rate 
about half the average. 
</P>
<P>
* Alcohol: People legally drunk behind the wheel have a fatality risk 7.66 
times the norm. Drivers who don't drink have a risk only about 60% of the norm. 
</P>
<P>
* Seat belts: Wearing a seat belt cuts a driver's risk of dying on the road in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
* Car size: Generally speaking, the bigger the car, the safer its occupants. 
Drive a large, heavy car -- a Chevrolet Caprice, for example, or a Ford LTD -- 
and your chances of dying in an accident are 26% less than average. Drive a 
compact and your death rate is about 35% higher than average. 
</P>
<P>
* Road type: Traveling on a rural interstate highway is about half as dangerous 
as driving on smaller roads and highways. 
</P>
<P>
According to Evans, people who violate every one of those safety factors -- 
young, drunk, un-seat-belted drivers in small cars on a winding country road -- 
risk a fatality rate of 930 deaths per billion miles driven. But someone at the 
other end of the scale -- experienced, sober, seat-belted, driving a big car on 
interstate routes -- would risk 0.804 fatalities per billion miles -- a rate 
1-1,157th as great. 
</P>
<P>
How do the safer group's odds compare to the chances of dying in a plane crash? 
Very favorably, Evans says. 
</P>
<P>
The risk-per-passenger-mile, the usual way airline safety is compared to that 
of car travel, actually decreases with the length of trip. This is because most 
plane crashes occur on takeoff or landing. Short flights and long flights, in 
other words, have the same chance of crashing. But longer flights spread those 
risks over many more miles, lowering the overall fatality rate for the 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Cars, the study concludes, can be safer than planes taking the statistically 
riskier shorter trips. For a 200-mile trip, the ideal driver is four times as 
safe in his or her car as on a plane. For a 300-mile trip, the car is twice as 
safe. Only after 600 miles -- when airplane fatality rates fall below 0.8 
deaths per billion miles -- does flying become a better alternative. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. Evans's analysis includes only the driver of a car -- the one 
at greatest risk. But passengers -- particularly those sitting in the relative 
safety of the back seat -- have much lower fatality rates than do drivers. If 
car occupants are included, the best-case highway fatality risk sinks to 0.59 
per billion miles driven, making sitting in the back seat preferable to flying 
for trips up to 800 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The assumptions do, however, come with a number of caveats. Not everyone 
choosing between a plane and a car can meet all the ideal driving 
characteristics. Not everyone, for example, wants to stay on interstates or has 
a big car available. 
</P>
<P>
Driving an average-size car -- say a Ford Taurus -- under otherwise ideal 
circumstances increases driving risk to 1.09 per billion miles, which makes 
driving preferable only for trips under 500 miles. Traveling in a compact -- 
which many Americans do -- pushes the risk to 1.48 per billion miles, wiping 
out much of the driving advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis is also very selective because it compares only fatalities. But on 
the highway, injuries are 70 times as likely as are fatalities. If a traveler 
is unwilling to accept a greatly increased chance of serious injury -- even if 
driving brings a lower fatality rate -- then flying still makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the question of balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds as if the article is much more interested in decomposing the average 
auto trip than the average airplane trip," said Arnold Barnett, an operations 
research specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said that if a similar effort were made to separate out all the factors 
that affect airline safety, the picture would change. The risks of flying 
aren't nearly as variable as those of driving, but there are some differences. 
Some airports -- such as Atlanta and Dulles near Washington, D.C., -- are safer 
than others such as Los Angeles and San Diego. Newer, bigger planes are less 
likely to crash than are smaller, older planes. An airline passenger sitting by 
an emergency exit may have a better chance of survival than someone trapped in 
the middle of a row. 
</P>
<P>
On a trip from Washington to Atlanta, is a sober 40-year-old sitting by the 
exit in a brand new jumbo jet still better off than behind the wheel of a 
Mercedes? Perhaps the airline industry will put forth an analysis to compare to 
GM's.

Fire investigators are looking for two boys who they suspect started a fire 
that destroyed one house and damaged two others Thursday in Paradise Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A home video taken by one of the residents shows two boys, about 9 or 10 years 
old, leaving the scene of the fire, said John Buono, a fire investigator for 
the Metro Arson Strike Team 
</P>
<P>
The video shows the boys, both wearing dark shorts and shirts and carrying 
butterfly nets, standing only a few feet away from the fire in its first 
stages, Buono said. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-acre brush fire, which spread from a canyon, was in the 5700 block of 
Rancho Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the two boys is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 
235-TIPS.

80% OF VENTURA WATER USERS MEET RATIONING GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 80% of Ventura's water customers are complying with the city's water 
conservation ordinance, city statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
The figures correspond to the first 3,000 or so bills mailed since the penalty 
phase of the ordinance went into effect July 12, city Department of Public 
Works spokeswoman Carol Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The bills were mailed Monday, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Among institutional customers, Holy Cross School, Ventura Missionary Baptist 
Church, Church of Latter-day Saints, Free Pentecostal Church and Fundamental 
Baptist Church were penalized for violating the ordinance, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The list of commercial and residential violators was not available Friday nor 
was the amount by which the institutions had exceeded their allocations. 
</P>
<P>
The total penalties assessed against the 501 customers who violated the 
ordinance were $90,523.16, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the penalty money will be reimbursed if, by the end of the 
year, the violators have saved enough water to make up for their excess use. 
The penalty money would then be credited to their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are charged four times the normal rate for excess use, but if they 
violate the ordinance three times in a row, they will be charged 10 times the 
normal rate. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties have been assessed so far on 373 residences, 122 commercial accounts, 
one school and five churches, for a total excess use of 14,139 hundred cubic 
feet or 10.6-million gallons. In Ventura, single-family residences are allowed 
294 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the city was pleased with the residents' performance and noted that 
more than half of the violators exceeded their allocations by less than 7,480 
gallons apiece.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Builder bashing is booming in the Los Angeles Times, thanks to your recent 
series of duplicative stories about the Laguna Niguel open-space controversy, 
as well as other recent articles and editorials concerning local public 
officials doing horrible things such as golfing with builders. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, we are writing in response to your editorial titled "County 
Planning -- Pattern of Blunders (Aug. 5)," in which you manage to attack the 
county's planning staff, the Planning Commission, City Council members, 
developers and the Orange County development planning process itself. 
</P>
<P>
The approval process for building homes in Orange County is cumbersome and 
subject to excruciating and exacting scrutiny. It is a process which entails 
many public hearings and compromises. It is totally open to the public and to 
every private interest group that may want to comment on a proposed development 
project. 
</P>
<P>
This process is the crucible for discussions and deciding the proper balance 
between environmental and economic issues; for parks and open-space issues; for 
transportation and low-density issues; for kangaroo rats and humans. In this 
process, projects are often rejected, and densities frequently reduced. All of 
these decisions directly impact the availability of all varieties of housing 
for residents of our county and region. 
</P>
<P>
The process includes a tremendous amount of interaction between people -- 
whether they are government officials, neighbors, consultants or builders. 
</P>
<P>
We think it works for Orange County. Look around you. Orange County is 
world-renowned as a place to live and work and play. It didn't happen that way 
by accident. It happened because of the process, because of thousands of 
dedicated men and women working within that process to produce homes, jobs, and 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Is the process perfect? Of course not. Some people are bunglers and some people 
are dishonest. But by and large, the process, and the people involved, have 
done a pretty good job in helping Orange County respond to the human and social 
needs of its residents.

GREAT PLAN OFFERS FUN TO SPECIAL KIDS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA, KIWANIS CLUB GEAR UP TO BUILD PARK FOR HANDICAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council and the Kiwanis Club are teaming up on a marvelous 
project that will develop a special playground facility for handicapped 
youngsters at Thornton Park on Segerstrom Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A trip to most playgrounds for handicapped youngsters can be a frustrating 
experience, when swings, basketball courts and merry-go-rounds are 
inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
The new 3-acre facility will offer two basketball courts with hoops that 
adjust, a playground, special trails to the park's lake and a camping area with 
bathrooms accessible to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis Club is endeavoring to raise money and get help from other 
organizations to build the park, which is estimated to cost at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The project is under way because the council has approved an agreement to make 
the space available, thus giving the go-ahead for the club to solicit donations 
and apply for a grant to buy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Kiwanis Club President Angel Rivas has said that the park will be available to 
handicapped youngsters from throughout the county, which is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Surely this project, a first in Orange County, is worthy of support by all who 
care about the quality of life for handicapped youngsters.

WHY NO ARRESTS MADE IN RACIAL ATTACK ON GIRL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was quite upset to read of young Amber Jefferson and the violent racial 
attack on her and her friends (Aug. 10). 
</P>
<P>
My first thought was for Amber and her family. Here is a young life that will 
never be the same. A half-white child that may come to hate part of her 
heritage because of what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
I was extremely distraught that no one had been arrested. That the situation 
was still under investigation because police could not determine exactly what 
happened. As if this child could have actually done something to make this 
assault seem reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian youth admitted, apparently, that he swung his bat first because 
he was frightened by the black youths. Immediately I feared for my own black 
life and the lives of my children. At any given moment someone might feel 
frightened by my presence and attack me. 
</P>
<P>
In your follow-up story you reported no arrests were made and that the 
Sheriff's Department was not classifying this as a racial attack. I am 
mortified. If black youths with baseball bats and shards of glass attacked 
white teen-agers, would it then be a racial attack? Who can we, as black 
parents living in Orange County, expect to protect our children? Where can we 
go for the justice? 
</P>
<P>
As I read Amber Jefferson's story, I shed many tears. Tears for Amber and her 
family. Tears for my own black daughter who frequently goes out with her white 
friends. Is she expected to silently accept a similar situation? Are her 
friends expected to risk their own lives defending her? Why doesn't our system 
of justice work in this instance? It seems to me that there was probable cause 
to arrest the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
The last tears I shed were for the part of me that died as I read about Amber. 
You see, I grew up believing the things I was taught about this country. Even 
on the days that I was called a "nigger," I believed those things and I 
believed I was a part of the fabric of this country. Even as I watched Martin 
Luther King, John and Bobby Kennedy and Malcolm X being gunned down. I believed 
in the system and the basic goodness of this country. As I listened to Nelson 
Mandela speak during his recent visit to our country I believed that maybe the 
world was changing and I felt proud to be a link in the American chain. I shed 
a tear now as I am reminded a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

NEA UNNECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has once again proved how far its editorial viewpoint is from the 
mainstream of Orange County political reality with "Good and Bad News for the 
Art Scene" (Aug. 19). The arts will do just fine in Orange County -- as shown 
by the number of art dealers, showplaces and festivals -- without government 
support as advocated by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) is correct in exposing the "avant-garbage" 
that is financed by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Times should be reminded that there will be no censorship of the arts if 
the government is not required to pick up the tab for NEA grants to "advanced" 
thinkers producing non-marketable trash masquerading as art.

NEIGHBORLY THING TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE HEART AND SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My first reaction to the story "RV -- Is It Refuge or Eyesore (Aug. 17)" was, 
and still is, disgust for the people who consider the value of their property 
more important than the value and quality of life of a human being who is 
living under difficult circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Fisher should be allowed to live in the RV at her cousin's home. She can 
be cared for without the loss of her dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher shows spunk and tenacity. Instead of burdening the county hospitals or 
welfare rolls, she is trying to live her life within her means. Her family is 
supporting her and should not be ostracized for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The two unnamed complaining families should search their souls and their 
motives. Unfortunately, they seem to reflect the "me, myself and I" society 
America is becoming. 
</P>
<P>
I pray that far more positive commentary is received in support of the special 
circumstances of Fisher. And that the city of San Juan Capistrano allows this 
special circumstance to continue.

WAYS TO END HUNGER NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your article (Aug. 11) on hunger conditions here in Orange 
County. There is no valid reason why hunger should exist here or elsewhere in 
the world -- there is enough food. But one reason it does is because people are 
uninformed. Articles such as those written by Carla Rivera provide education 
and information so that someday we can end hunger. Beyond education, it is even 
more important that we ask why hunger exists, find the answers and then get our 
legislators and Congress to establish policies and enact laws which will 
provide the key answers. We must treat the causes as well as the symptoms, as 
was done in the 1970s when hunger in the United States was essentially ended. 
</P>
<P>
One main cause of hunger in the United States now is low wages. Many people do 
not realize that national minimum wages were not allowed to rise all during the 
1980s even though the cost of living rose about 70%. This was a deliberate 
policy of the Reagan Administration. In addition, Social Security taxes rose, 
and income tax policies were changed. As a result, low- and middle-income 
Americans have had to bear a larger share of the tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
With the combination of fixed minimum wages, higher taxes on lower-income 
people, greatly increased housing costs and new jobs being mostly service types 
at minimum wage, it is no surprise that there are so many hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, many people are sympathetic to those in need and have given time 
and money to direct aid. However, it is critical now that local, state and 
federal governments establish policies regarding wage levels, employment, 
affordable housing and health care, which will -- in a fair manner -- help 
those on the lower rungs of the ladder help themselves, as they want to do.

TAKING SIDES ON INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To those Huntington Beach citizens who couldn't, or chose not to, attend the 
three-ring circus on Aug. 10 in the council chambers concerning the Save Our 
Parks initiative and a companion alternative, you missed a show. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Our Parks proponents became so obsessed with their zeal to beat down 
any opposition, they became paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
The unjustified abuse that four of our more moderate council members were 
exposed to was insulting, demeaning and a reflection on the mentality and 
motivations of this spurious minority group. 
</P>
<P>
As a representative member of the non-vocal, including the senior, sector of 
Huntington Beach, if we let this loose-cannon Save Our Parks group prevail, it 
would be a disaster and set Huntington Beach back 50 years for the benefit of a 
small equestrian group.

NEIGHBORLY THING TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE HEART AND SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just how does this one RV in question, turn the area into a park? It's also 
amazing to me that these people can exhibit such concern about their 
neighborhood and show so little compassion to their neighbor Linda Fisher. I 
sympathize with Fisher in her fight for life and now her fight for a place to 
call home! It's a shame that a $400,000 home means more to these neighbors than 
the quality of an individual's life. 
</P>
<P>
I admire her for her independence in trying to care for herself. Most 
individuals are not that brave to endure the battles she's been fighting. Why 
don't these "busy body" neighbors channel their energies toward a more 
constructive neighborly role? Such as volunteering their time at a community 
hospice or oncology unit. Then maybe they will acquire some respect for human 
life. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Tom Merrell, San Juan Capistrano's planning manager, reconsiders his 
actions and allows Fisher to stay where she is. If anything, she is an example 
of American courage and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
Let Fisher stay home!

Now I've heard everything! What happened to compassion and caring about one's

else to do besides checking on what their neighbors are doing, give them a 
cause. God knows, there are plenty of them to zero in on.

OVERRIDE OF VETO KEEPS PICUS' STUDY PLAN ALIVE; 
</P>
<P>
WARNER RIDGE: BRADLEY HAD ELIMINATED FUNDS FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, SAYING 
THE CITY SHOULD CONSIDER A COMPROMISE WITH THE DEVELOPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid heavy lobbying, the Los Angeles City Council swept aside a mayoral veto to 
revive Councilwoman Joy Picus' effort to block the commercial development of 
Warner Ridge in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 11 to 2 Friday to override Mayor Tom Bradley's veto of a 
$250,000 project to study the effect of a Picus-backed amendment to the Warner 
Ridge community plan that would allow only single-family residences on the 
21.5-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The developer wants to build several medium-rise office towers, and possibly as 
many as 350 residential units, something that would be allowed under the 
current plan. But homeowner groups oppose that plan and Picus has sided with 
them in an attempt to amend the plan and block commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Picus asked for the money to study changing the plan, but Bradley had vetoed 
the allocation, saying the city should consider a compromise with the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear, however, whether the environmental review can be conducted 
in time to checkmate the developer. "Only a few people in the city attorney's 
office think this can be done in four months," said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. 
</P>
<P>
A judge has given the city until Dec. 21 to make the plan conform to the 
current zoning in the area, which is for residential development. If the plan 
is not brought into conformity, the developer will be in a more powerful 
position to achieve its goals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her victory, Picus angrily denounced Bradley's role in the Warner Ridge 
matter, claiming he "poured on all the steam" to lobby council members to 
sustain his veto. 
</P>
<P>
Three lawmakers confirmed for The Times that they were lobbied by the mayor. 
But each asked not to be identified. One of the lawmakers also said he was 
heavily lobbied by Picus. "Oh, God, did she lobby? It was a do-or-die situation 
for her," said one of the three. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was angry enough to give reporters a document purporting to show that the 
developer had contributed $11,000 in campaign funds to Bradley since December, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Picus campaign contribution innuendoes, Fabiani said: "When 
Mrs. Picus can't win by logic or argument, she sadly resorts to personal 
attacks on the mayor; these allegations don't deserve a response." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner chief Robert Gross, like Picus, was happy about the victory but 
bitter that the mayor's veto had caused a 15-day delay in starting the 
environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
"The net result of the mayor's veto is that we lost 15 days of valuable time," 
said Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Time is important to Picus' efforts to block the plans of partners The Spound 
Co. and Johnson Wax Development Co. to build a major commercial project on the 
Warner Ridge site. 
</P>
<P>
In late July, Superior Judge John R. Zebrowski gave the city until late 
December to bring its zoning and community plan for Warner Ridge into 
conformity. 
</P>
<P>
It often takes a year to amend the city's community plans. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Ridge developer Albert Spound said he was disappointed by the council's 
action and pledged to continue with a lawsuit against the city filed by the 
development team. The suit, filed last April, complains that the city -- and 
especially Picus -- is seeking to deprive the developer of its property rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Picus made the land commercial, we bought it because it was commercial and now 
she has tried to pull the rug out from under us," Spound said. "Thank God for 
the court system." In the lawsuit, Picus is accused of flip-flopping on her 
support of the commercial development of Warner Ridge as powerful homeowner 
groups threatened to withdraw their support for her before her 1989 reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the council voted to reject the developer's commercial project, 
which Picus said would inundate Woodland Hills with traffic and smog, and to 
zone the property for low-density housing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was Picus' principal ally in arguing for an 
override. Yaroslavsky, in an interview later, said lawmakers saw the Warner 
Ridge matter as a classic test between developers and the city. "If developers 
think they can go into court and get the zoning they need to override the 
council . . . then there'll be no end to the challenges," Yaroslavsky warned. 
"This isn't just about Warner Ridge, it's about all neighborhoods."

RASMUSSEN LOSES, WONDERS WHAT LIES AHEAD

Dennis Rasmussen, just like everyone else in the Padre clubhouse, is quite 
curious these days, asking a lot of questions but finding no answers. 
</P>
<P>
It has actually been cruel in a way. The Padres not only have left Rasmussen 
without clues concerning next season, they can't even tell him if he'll still 
be be pitching for them next week. 
</P>
<P>
Here he was Saturday night, pitching one of the finest games of any Padre 
starter this season -- losing, 2-1, to the Montreal Expos -- and Manager Greg 
Riddoch could only shrug his shoulders when asked if Rasmussen will be around 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't tell you," Riddoch said, "because I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rasmussen: "I sure don't know what's going on, but I'd like for someone to 
please let me know." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have left everyone a little confused by employing six left-handers 
on their staff. Obviously, a couple will have to go. But can the Padres really 
count on recently acquired lefties Derek Lilliquist and Atlee Hammaker next 
season, or will they abandon all three and try to obtain free-agent left-hander 
Buddy Black of the Cleveland Indians? 
</P>
<P>
"None of us really know what's going on," Rasmussen said. "Derek pitches a 
shutout and gets thrown back in the bullpen. What's that all about? Atlee, what 
are we were going to do with him? Do we know what we're doing to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, 31, is five weeks away from becoming a free agent, and if he had his 
druthers, he'd sign a three-year contract and stay with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres had their druthers and decided to keep him, they'd want to sign 
him to a one-year contract with a one-year option. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, who really knows what anyone wants? The Padres have twice turned 
down requests by Bob Teaff, Rasmusseen's agent, to discuss a contract. And the 
Padres have not decided among themselves whether they're willing to set 
Rasmussen free. 
</P>
<P>
It's a topic that soon must be addressed, considering that the trading deadline 
is Aug. 31, when playoff rosters must be set. If the Padres decide they do not 
want to keep Rasmussen, they figure they might as well trade him this week to a 
contender and obtain something in return. If they wait until the end of the 
season and lose him to free agency, their only compensation will be a draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you look solely at the man's record -- 8-13 with nine defeats in his past 10 
decisions -- the choice appears easy. 
</P>
<P>
But if you look at his performance Saturday, the Padres could look awfully 
stupid by letting him go. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm screwing up their plans by pitching well," Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Rasmussen had as strong a performance as he has had all season, and 
for 5 2/3 innings, he had the crowd of 18,239 at Olympic Stadium believing that 
they might be witnessing a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Not only couldn't the Expos get a hit, but only three times were they even able 
to hit the ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The only difficulty Rasmussen was encountering was walking people, issuing a 
leadoff walk to Otis Nixon in the sixth inning, his fifth of the game. It 
turned out to be the one that would haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon went on to second base after Marquis Grissom grounded out to Rasmussen 
and took third on Tim Raines' ground ball. That brought up Tim Wallach, who has 
this nasty habit of tearing apart the Padres with his bat, hitting .419 against 
them this season with four homers and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he took Rasmussen's 1-0 hanging changeup and slashed it to left 
field. In one pitch, Wallach erased Rasmussen's no-hitter, shutout and lead, 
leaving Rasmussen to disgustedly slam his fist into his glove. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen got out of the inning seconds later, when Wallach was thrown out at 
second base by left fielder Joe Carter, but it only prolonged his misery. 
</P>
<P>
Two pitches later, Andres Galarraga led off the seventh with a homer to right 
field on a high fastball, and with the way the Padres are hitting of late, that 
was all the Expos needed. 
</P>
<P>
The only offense the Padres produced the entire game was courtesy of Bip 
Roberts, who homered on the first pitch of the game, and doubled and stole 
third in the sixth. In fact, if not for Roberts, the Padres never would have 
even reached second, obtaining just four hits off rookies Chris Nabholz (2-0) 
and Mel Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' anemic offense once again punished Rasmussen, scoring just 25 runs 
for him this season in his 13 defeats. For a guy who has allowed four or fewer 
runs in 25 of his starts, something's not quite right about an 8-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I do but hang with them?" Rasmussen said. "I mean, look at (Ed) 
Whitson. The guy leads the league in ERA (2.41), and he's got only 10 wins. 
It's a joke. It's a shame. He should have 16 of 18 wins by now, minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, at least, has the luxury of being under contract the next two seasons. 
Rasmussen is looking for one. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm not in their plans here," Rasmussen said. "The door's been open 
all year long, and they haven't signed me. Maybe they think I'm expendable. But 
I'm not going to beg for a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'll pitch for somebody. You can't tell me that somebody can't use me. 
I'm healthy. I've never been on the disabled list. And you give me the ball 
every five days, and I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
So, just what can a pitching coach say to his starter at a time like this, when 
he allows just two earned runs in his past 14 innings, and obtains two defeats? 
</P>
<P>
"You just say," said Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach, " 'Just think, you get 
to do this again in five days, you lucky guy, you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts' homer was the first leadoff homer by a Padre since Sept. 17, 1989, 
when second baseman Roberto Alomar homered off Rick Reuschel at Candlestick 
Park. "That was the first time I ever did that, ever," Roberts said. "The only 
trouble was that everyone wanted me to give them a scouting report once I got 
back to the bench, and it's pretty tough to do that on one pitch." It also was 
Roberts' first homer since June 17, giving him seven for the season, three more 
than he had entering this season. . . . Roberts' double gave him two extra-base 
hits in six innings. The entire Padre team has just 12 extra-base hits in the 
past 133 innings. . . . Greg Riddoch, on the height of the game's two starters, 
6-foot-6 Rasmussen and 6-foot-6 Nabholz: "With those two guys on the mound, we 
could have started off the game with a jump ball." . . . Pat Dobson was 
impressed after having Atlee Hammaker work out for him Saturday for the first 
time, but has advised Hammaker to eliminate his split-finger fastball. "He's 
had enough injuries, and that pitch isn't going to help him," Dobson said. 
"We're going to get him working on a changeup." . . . Padre left fielder Joe 
Carter has gone eight consecutive games without driving in a run, equaling his 
longest drought of the season. He also is in a three-for-30 slump (.100). . . . 
Padre outfielder Fred Lynn is mired in a one-for-18 slump, and has just two 
hits in his past 31 at-bats (.065) since July 5. . . . Padre first baseman Jack 
Clark, who has missed the past four games with a strained right hamstring, was 
able to take infield before the game Saturday, but still is doubtful to play 
before Tuesday in New York. . . . Hal McRae, the Expo hitting coach, who 
provided Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo with some batting tips before the 
game Saturday, is a proud papa these days watching his son, Brian, step into 
the Kansas City Royal lineup three weeks ago and bat .330. "I think I'm as 
surprised as anyone," he said. "I was just hoping he'd do well enough where he 
could stay up in the big leagues." McRae's only distress is that the Royals 
keep trying to persuade Brian to wear Hal's old uniform number, No. 11. "He 
doesn't want to wear it," McRae said, "he wants his own identity. So he's 
wearing No. 56. Get it? Five and six, making 11." . . . The Padres will play 
the third game of their four-game series against the Expos at 10:35 a.m. (PDT) 
today. Bruce Hurst (8-8) is scheduled to face Kevin Gross (8-10).

DOBSON GRADUALLY RECOVERS FROM CLUB'S MANAGERIAL SNUB 
</P>

<P>
The subject is still painful, and even today, six weeks later, it causes him to 
wince, grab a smoke and suck down some coffee before he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach, is no longer bitter. His animosity toward the 
organization's front office has slowly evaporated. But he'd be lying, he says, 
if he said there is no lingering resentment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if the Padres had chosen someone from outside the organization to 
manage the club in 1991 instead of Greg Riddoch, Dobson said Saturday, he would 
have left the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
He has a two-year contract that extends through the 1991 season, but he said it 
wouldn't have stopped him from walking away from his $75,000 yearly salary and 
just sitting out for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had brought in an outside guy," Dobson said, "I would have left. I 
couldn't have possibly stayed. There's just no way I could come back after 
having it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, considered by many baseball executives to be the finest pitching coach 
in the National League, can accept being passed over once for the Padre 
managerial job. But if it happens again, he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't as upset over losing out to Greg Riddoch as he was about the way the 
hiring process was handled. Dobson says he was not given the consideration of 
an interview or even notified when the job opened at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
He says the first time he knew Jack McKeon was leaving the job was when Bill 
Beck, McKeon's front-office assistant, told the team before a morning workout 
on July 11 that there would be a meeting at 9 in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it didn't even hit me at the time what was going on," Dobson said. 
"But then I saw Jack (McKeon), and I knew he was supposed to be at the All-Star 
game. I saw Greg (Riddoch), and I knew he was planning to just meet the team in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it dawned on me what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon was going out. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch was coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson was staying put. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I was upset," Dobson said. "It probably took me most of that (ensuing 
11-day) road trip to get over it. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that upset me is that I had told people I wanted to do the job, 
everyone knew that. But when they hired Greg, I didn't even get a gratis phone 
call. Hey, I'm not saying they had to give me reasons why they didn't hire me, 
or even interview me, but I thought I at least deserved the consideration of a 
courtesy phone call and told what was going on. To me, that was just protocol, 
and it wasn't even used. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why if they didn't hire Greg back, I didn't want to be back, either. 
Getting passed over once, fine, I can live with that. But being passed over 
twice, I would have had to leave, knowing this wasn't going to be the land of 
opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, 48, still wants to manage in the big leagues some day. He isn't 
managing the Ft. Myers Sun Sox in the Seniors League just to hang around the 
fellas. 
</P>
<P>
But now, for the first time this season, Dobson is content. He has become 
Riddoch's right-hand man in the dugout and is being given all responsibilities 
regarding pitchers, with the exception of deciding when it's time to remove one 
from the game. In essence, Riddoch has made him sort of an assistant manager 
without the title. 
</P>
<P>
And the way Dobson has orchestrated his pitching staff these past few weeks, 
it's little wonder the Padres have won 21 of 32 games, with earned runs 
becoming as rare as dollar-a-gallon gas. 
</P>
<P>
In this stretch, Padre pitchers have yielded three or fewer earned runs in 22 
starts. And in the past 15 games, they've put up outrageous numbers: four 
shutouts . . . four games in which they've allowed one run . . . three games in 
which they've allowed two runs . . . six home runs (five with the bases empty) 
. . . a 1.85 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think Dobson is getting every last drop of talent out of his 
pitching staff, take a look at his personnel: Seven pitchers are castoffs from 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ed Whitson, discarded four years ago by the New York Yankees, owns the 
lowest ERA in the National League, yielding just one run in his past 27 1/3 
innings. His ERA since Dobson joined the staff in 1988 has plummeted from 4.73 
to 3.77 to 2.66 to 2.41 this season. Dobson Doing: He made sure Whitson no 
longer tried to blow his fastball past everybody and had him rely on his 
control instead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Craig Lefferts, allowed to leave the San Francisco Giants without a fight, 
has already attained a career-high 21 saves. Since the All-Star break, he has 
yielded two runs in 20 2/3 innings (0.87), converting 10 of 11 save 
opportunities. Dobson Doing: He limited Lefferts to just one inning whenever 
possible, minimizing the strain on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Derek Lilliquist, given up by Atlanta six weeks ago, now has pitched 14 
consecutive shutout innings. Dobson Doing: Lilliquist's delivery was so bad 
that he was suffering back problems. Dobson made a simple adjustment, and 
presto. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rich Rodriguez, who bounced around six years in the New York Mets' minor 
league system, has allowed just five baserunners without a run in his past six 
outings. Dobson Doing: He eliminated Rodriguez's high leg-kick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calvin Schiraldi, he was traded away three years ago by the Boston Red Sox 
and abandoned a year ago by the Chicago Cubs, is pitching the best he has since 
his rookie season in 1986, allowing a 3.64 ERA in his four starts. Dobson 
Doing: Schiraldi could never be effective as a reliever, so Dobson insisted on 
making him a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dennis Rasmussen, 2-6 with a 5.75 ERA when the Cincinnati Reds gave up on 
him in 1988, has gone 32-27 since coming to the Padres, although he is 8-13 
this season. Dobson Doing: He stressed the importance of inducing ground balls 
and forgetting about the strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Atlee Hammaker, released last week by the Giants despite having another 
guaranteed year on his contract. Dobson Doing: Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Pat Dobson here was one of the biggest reasons I came," said Hammaker, 
who also had offers from the Dodgers and Mets. "I mean, I had just heard so 
much about the guy. Everybody raves about him, and you can see the effect he's 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Before Dobson's arrival, Rollie Fingers (1977 and 1978) had been the only Padre 
reliever with more than 26 saves in a season; Mark Davis had 28 in 1988 and 44 
in 1989, and Lefferts is now on a pace to save 28 games, with an opportunity to 
get at least 30. 
</P>
<P>
Before Dobson's arrival, the Padres never had three consecutive years in which 
a pitcher threw at least 230 innings; Eric Show pitched 234 2/3 in 1988, Bruce 
Hurst 244 2/3 last season, and Whitson is on a pace for 242. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, no two Padre starters had combined for six shutouts in a season: 
Bruce Hurst and Ed Whitson have five between them. 
</P>
<P>
Get the picture on why Hammaker chose the Padres, when he could be in the 
middle of a pennant stretch with someone else? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the man does know pitching. Anyone in the game can tell you that. Perhaps 
even more of a testimony to him, the Padres have not even had a single arm 
injury to a pitcher that has required time on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The question that now looms is whether anyone believes he can manage a major 
league team, joining Roger Craig of San Francisco to give the major leagues two 
managers who are former major league pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is," Dobson said, "I think there's a stigma that pitchers 
can't be managers, that they don't know how to run the offense. I can't 
understand that. They say pitching is 75% of the game, don't they? Well, I 
certainly know how a pitching staff is used, and I know I can run an offense. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in mind I can be a manager. I know I can do it. Now, it's 
just whether I'll get the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, I'm not going to worry about it. I'm going to help out Greg the best 
I can, and I'm going to honor this two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"But I won't sign another two-year deal. I want to keep my options open this 
time."

SUMMER OF CHANGE NOT OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle for independents has been waged all summer, in airport hotels and 
athletic department offices. From Syracuse to Miami of Florida, with a pivotal 
pit stop at Florida State, it has begun to change the face of college football. 
</P>
<P>
There are many questions looming as the 1990 season begins, and hardly any of 
them have to do with what is going to take place between the goal posts. "Who's 
No. 1?" has been replaced by "Who's going where?" For now, the Heisman Trophy 
race is merely an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a new rumor every day," says Penn State athletic director Jim Tarman. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest rumors involve the independents, those schools without conference 
affiliations (at least for football), some of whom have been as hotly pursued 
in the past few months as a blue-chip tailback with blazing speed. 
</P>
<P>
And of the independents, none have been courted more than Miami, Florida State 
and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious talk right now concerns the Seminoles, who have held 
preliminary discussions with both the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic 
Coast Conference. The SEC is also reportedly interested in the Hurricanes, 
while the ACC has toyed with the idea of bringing in several teams, strictly 
for football, and setting up divisional play with the purpose of improving its 
lackluster image. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was two notable football independents that set this commotion in 
motion earlier this year. Notre Dame's decision to sign its own separate 
television package with NBC, a five-year package worth an estimated $35 
million, and Penn State's announced intentions to join the Big 10, put the 
handwriting on the wall in rather large dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We all might have our own school colors on Saturdays, but we have the same 
color the rest of the week -- green," said the athletic director at one ACC 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Realignment in college football these days has nothing to do with going back to 
the winged-T. It has to do with Arkansas leaving its 76-year association with 
the Southwest Conference in the dust for the greener pastures of the SEC. It 
has to do the possible merger between leagues to form what will come to be 
known as superconferences. 
</P>
<P>
(Question: if the Big Sky merges with the Mid-American Conference, otherwise 
known as the MAC, will all pre-game meals be served with pickles and onion on a 
sesame seed bun?) 
</P>
<P>
"The independents are going through tough times," says Florida State athletic 
director Bob Goin, whose school, for the time being, is still a member of the 
Metro Conference in all sports but football. "Everything is pointing to being 
in a conference." 
</P>
<P>
Which conference to join is perhaps the biggest dilemma for some of the highly 
sought-after independents to figure. Would Florida State benefit more from 
aligning with a league strong in both football and basketball, such as the SEC, 
than going to the ACC, which is anxious to balance the interest between the two 
sports, not to mention its books? 
</P>
<P>
It is certainly an enviable position for the Seminoles to be in. Florida State 
president Bernard Sliger has said that the school could make a decision 
sometime in the next two months, and until that happens, will enjoy its 
driver's seat vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
"From talking with everyone, I have gotten the impression that we are a key 
player (in expansion)," Sliger said after a meeting with ACC officials earlier 
this month in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of the equation is how much expansion would help the respective 
leagues involved. Would a league such as the ACC, which hasn't done poorly 
paying its bills in the past with only eight schools, help itself more by 
opening its doors to a Florida State, a Miami, a Syracuse or even a Pitt? ACC 
officials have maintained a veil of silence on the league's position, but the 
whispers along Tobacco Road strongly suggest that the league is resisting any 
kind of expansion at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we can contribute to the ACC in football, while the ACC would 
contribute to Florida State in basketball," said Goin. "It would be positive 
for both sides in all sports." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of the Seminoles joining the ACC, Virginia football 
coach George Welsh said, "I think it would be good. But I think that the 
schools in our league would have to raise their programs to Florida State's 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the obvious attractions, there are some drawbacks for the 
independents interested in becoming part of a league, as there is for Notre 
Dame remaining by itself, which also seems likely. For the Fighting Irish, it 
might make it more difficult to play the kind of competitive schedule it seeks. 
For the others, there would be more obstacles inside a league than outside. 
</P>
<P>
Take Penn State, for instance. The Nittany Lions won two national championships 
during the 1980s. Conversely, the Big Ten has not finished a season with a 
consensus No. 1 since Ohio State in 1968. "Winning the national championship as 
part of the Big Ten will be more difficult," says Tarman, "but it won't be out 
of the realm of possibility."

SLOWER IS BETTER FOR THE PAC-10 CONFERENCE

<P>
Expansion to 12 teams is a good idea for the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not something members of the league should leap into in fear of what 
the Southeastern Conference and others might do. 
</P>
<P>
C'mon now ... that whole Texas scenario was a reach, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The real bosses of the Pac-10 -- the university presidents and chancellors -- 
recognized that this week when they told the athletic directors to slow down 
and make sure they know exactly what they're getting into. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford athletic director Andy Geiger, adamantly opposed to quick expansion, 
said he couldn't believe his ears as he sat in a meeting of his peers and heard 
the bubbling groundswell of immediate expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I whispered to one of my colleagues, 'Is this the way you would plot and plan 
to expand your business?' " Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to imagine what would happen if this were a seminar in a school of 
business at any one of our universities. Expanding the Pac-10? First things 
first: We'd do a case study. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the givens involved? The aspirations of the league? The short-term 
and long-term goals? We'd do a mission statement, look at the potentials, and 
that would lead you to what your next steps would be." 
</P>
<P>
That takes time. More time, apparently, than Texas and Texas A&amp;M have to 
wait around for the Pac-10, so they're probably headed for the SEC unless the 
political pressure forces them to remain with their fellow Texans in the 
Southworst Conference. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK. If a more complete approach convinces the Pac-10 that it should 
expand in a year or so, Colorado and Brigham Young, as well as Air Force and 
Utah, wouldn't turn them down. 
</P>
<P>
And considering the presidents really are in charge, pure football and 
basketball revenues will not be the only considerations involved in expansion. 
Sharing research between medical schools and the like is a vital part of the 
association of universities, as the chief execs see it, which is a wild concept 
to the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
And in this "age of reform," that's exactly how it should be. The power of the 
TV buck shouldn't reduce universities to a series of teams that happen to place 
each other on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 likes to consider itself at the top of the integrity scale, and it 
generally takes a leading role in the NCAA insofar as reform is concerned. This 
might be its chance to elevate and expand its agenda further, with more direct 
results. 
</P>
<P>
While the SEC is football grabbing and doing little for its generally awful 
academic reputation, the Pac-10 and Big Ten for starters (with the Atlantic 
Coast Conference another possibility, considering its prestige) could begin 
serious discussions about the role of athletics in universities. 
</P>
<P>
More stringent admission and academic requirements? More and better 
cost-cutting measures? Shifting a handful of scholarships from football to 
other sports? 
</P>
<P>
The huge TV dollars and possible conference expansion should be construed as an 
opportunity for improvement in college athletics rather than further reason for 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The Kickoff Classic is just a week away, when USC plays Syracuse Aug. 30. But 
that's almost a week later than the college football season kicks off. 
</P>
<P>
Yessir, thanks to a scheduling conflict at Anaheim Stadium (the Angels and Rams 
get first crack at it), the inaugural Disneyland Kickoff Classic had to be 
pushed a week earlier than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, freshmen at Colorado and Tennessee had to show up for practice 
July 31. The Buffaloes face the Volunteers on Sunday at noon, when Anaheim 
Stadium will look pretty funny half empty for two Top 10 teams to officially 
open the season. 
</P>
<P>
The way Augustin Olobia has looked in practice at Washington State, perhaps the 
junior from Nigeria is more than just a sprinter wearing shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
Olobia has good enough size (5-foot-10, 194) and as much speed as anyone in the 
country. He has caught touchdown passes of 75 and 35 yards in the Cougars' two 
scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
With Olobia's world-class speed, coach Mike Price doesn't have to teach him too 
many patterns -- just one, and then tell the quarterbacks to try to overthrow 
him.

MODERATELY HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD SPUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRY, EASE NEED FOR 
IMPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Verleger's viewpoint that the "U.S. Could Do a Lot More to Cope With Oil 
Crises" (Aug. 12) presents a rational analysis of the problems. In closing, he 
advocates that higher energy prices, though not popular, should be part of the 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
However, he should have included a fourth point. Our increased use of foreign 
oil is the result of five years of depressed crude oil prices making many of 
our domestic oil fields uneconomic. The greatest potential for reducing our 
dependence on imported oil (and hence future economic stability) is by allowing 
moderately higher oil prices to revitalize the U.S. Oil Patch. This won't 
result in proportionately higher gasoline prices since it will restore the 
balance of profit between petroleum production, refining and marketing while 
reducing the trade deficit.

SOME USES JUSTIFY HEAVY GOVERNMENT BORROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some comments on James Flanigan's "Watch Out for Deflation, Not Inflation" 
column (Aug. 12): 
</P>
<P>
* The high unemployment began in 1975 and, through 1987, constituted the 
third-worst record in a century -- exceeded only by the great slumps of the 
1890s and 1920s. There may be a question one day as to whether oil was the 
cause, or overcapacity on a worldwide basis. 
</P>
<P>
* I remain surprised that people talk of the deficit as being historically high 
-- not as a fraction of GNP, and the same holds true for government debt as a 
fraction of total debt. If the thinking that holds today had been used for 
policy in the 1940s, we could not have financed World War II. Why, then, is 
increased government spending so horrifying? 
</P>
<P>
* Unemployment today is worse than indicated because of the addition of the 
military to the employed work force in recent years, and the vast increase in 
part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder why nobody has pointed to one of the most fundamental causes of the 
size of the S&amp;L bailout. Since the deregulation of interest rates paid to 
depositors a decade or so ago, the interest rates paid depositors have 
constantly remained well above the inflation rate. Because interest rate 
payoffs are also part of the insurance up to the $100,000 limit, lots of 
depositors are making big profits on no-risk deposits -- including drug dealers 
lured in by high rates. Paying off depositors at a "ceiling" of interest rates 
indexed to inflation would be reasonable, equitable and cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way -- if we stumble into war in the Middle East, nobody will 
worry about government borrowing -- why would it be so awful to spend on 
education, infrastructure, etc.

A FEW OTHER SUGGESTIONS TO PAY FOR S&amp;L BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vic Simon's article is right on. But why stop at taxing IRA's and Keogh's? Lets 
tax all pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
And, if it's only money that we need (damn the moral issue), lets tax churches, 
temples and all other religious efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Get real, Vic. Everyone knows the real reason for the S&amp;L failures and the 
budget deficit. Attack the germ, not the rash. Get Congress to cut spending and 
put those S&amp;L thieves in jail.

MINOR LEAGUES / SEAN WATERS; 
</P>
<P>
REDFIELD YEARNS FOR HIS MOMENT IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For every Robin Yount who signs a multiyear, megabucks contract, there is a 
chorus line of Joe Redfields singing, "I Can Do This, I Can Do That." 
</P>
<P>
And they'll play for a fraction of the price. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the musical, however, the real-life stars don't step aside to give the 
supporting cast a chance to be headliners. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years, Redfield, 29, has performed in the minors, waiting for someone 
to leave the big show. This season, he is playing for the Denver Zephyrs, the 
Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A affiliate in the American Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Redfield's travels have also included trips through the triple-A towns of 
Norfolk, Va., Moosic, Pa., and Edmonton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
With each club, the former Miraleste High standout has been one step away from 
the majors. At the same time, he has considered walking away from baseball to 
pursue a degree in dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt many times I would like to hang it up," said Redfield, who majored in 
biology at UC Santa Barbara. "(But) getting to play one game in the major 
leagues makes the headaches worthwhile. I'll keep trying as long as they give 
me a uniform." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets selected Redfield in the ninth round of the 1982 June amateur draft 
after his junior year at UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
Redfield considered quitting in his third season after being sent from the 
Mets' double-A organization in Jackson, Miss. to their class-A team in 
Lynchburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the minor-league director if he sent me to single-A ball to save his 
breath, I'm not going," Redfield said. "The Jackson owner, who was a friend of 
mine, talked to me and convinced me to hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets converted Redfield to third base from shortstop, the position he 
played in college. He said he was too slow getting to ground balls and covering 
second base on steal attempts in professional ball. 
</P>
<P>
The transition was successful, and before the end of the 1985 season, Redfield 
replaced an injured Kevin Mitchell for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After four years in the Mets' organization, Redfield was traded to Baltimore 
for Rick Lockwood in a swap of minor-league third basemen. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the Charlotte Orioles (double-A), Redfield had a .297 average and 
14 home runs. He also was selected the best defensive player on his team. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles weren't that impressed, trading Redfield to the Angels for catcher 
Stan Cliburn, the younger brother of pitcher Stuart Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1987 season, Redfield met to discuss his baseball future with family 
friend and Angel pitching coach Tom Morgan at Redfield's Palos Verdes home. 
Morgan knew that Redfield had some impressive statistics and couldn't 
understand why he hadn't been promoted to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I wasn't going after my goal hard enough," Redfield said about his 
conversation with the former New York Yankee pitcher. "My numbers were good, 
but I wasn't getting a chance. He taught me to think positive, be more 
goal-directed and do only the things that would help me make the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan worked to change Redfield's lifestyle and set down new ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
* No more late nights with David Letterman and sleeping till noon the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
* No fishing or golfing on game days. 
</P>
<P>
* No more drinks with the boys the night before or after a game. 
</P>
<P>
* No more junk food. 
</P>
<P>
If Redfield wanted entertainment, he could read the positive-thinking books 
that Morgan left with him. 
</P>
<P>
Redfield responded with his best season. He led the Texas League in home runs 
(30), runs batted in (108) and runs scored (108) playing for the Midland 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The big-league Angels, however, bypassed Redfield when they expanded their 
roster to 40 players in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty disappointed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also didn't invite Redfield to major-league camp for spring training 
in 1988 and dispatched him to their triple-A team in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
But Redfield soon got his chance. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days into the season, outfielder Devon White and infielder Gus Polidor were 
injured and Redfield was promoted to the big club. He played one game against 
Milwaukee and flied out twice against pitcher Teddy Higuera. Redfield still 
talks about his two at-bats as if he hit a game-winning home run in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty exciting for me to bat against Teddy Higuera," he said. "Some 
guys like to talk about their major-league experience and I'm one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates get tired of hearing about it." 
</P>
<P>
Following a two-week stay in the major leagues, Redfield returned to Edmonton 
where he had a 17-game hitting streak, the longest of his career. He finished 
with a .290 batting average and was selected the team's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
After seven years in the minors, Redfield had the option to sign a free-agent 
contract with any major-league organization and chose the Philadelphia 
Phillies, figuring that Mike Schmidt would soon retire and create an opening on 
the 24-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Redfield received his first invitation to major-league spring 
training, and batted .340 as a late-inning replacement for Schmidt. When it 
came to the final roster cut, the Phillies signed free-agent outfielder Dwayne 
Murphy and reassigned Redfield to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in Moosic, Pa. On the 
last day of camp, Redfield pulled a back muscle and missed the first 25 games 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt retired by midseason, but Redfield was unable to take advantage of the 
opportunity. He struggled to overcome his injury and hit only .249 at Scranton. 
The Phillies, meanwhile, acquired third baseman Charlie Hayes as part of deal 
that sent reliever Steve Bedrosian to the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big opportunity for me when Schmidt retired," Redfield said. "I was 
getting back from the injury when they needed someone to replace him. But when 
I came back, (the back) was still bad, but good enough to play. I really tried, 
but I wasn't ready." 
</P>
<P>
When it came to contract-signing time this year, Redfield moved on to Denver, 
joining the Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A team. Infielders Jim Gantner, Bill 
Spiers and Paul Molitor were recovering from injuries and the Brewers had 
doubts as to whether they would regain their health. 
</P>
<P>
After 122 games with Denver, Redfield is still waiting for his chance. He has a 
.270 average with 14 home runs and 62 RBIs despite nagging knee and shoulder 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't make it with a major-league team this year, I would like to play 
closer to home in the Pacific Coast League," Redfield said. "The traveling in 
this league is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Redfield, however, wouldn't mind playing in Denver if it means playing for a 
major-league team. He might get his chance if he can wait until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
With the National League scheduled to add two expansion teams in 1993, Denver 
has become one of the favorites to land a franchise. Voters in a six-county tax 
district approved a 0.1% sales tax on Aug. 14 that will help raise funds for a 
proposed $140 million, open-air stadium seating 40,000.

HARPER PREVAILS TO KEEP POINTS LEAD AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early Saturday evening, Saugus Speedway officials drew numbers to see which car 
would start on the pole of the 40-lap Sportsman main event. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be Ole 96, the car of Tarzana's Will Harper. Only it would 
have been wise if the officials had just called things right then and there. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was no way that Harper, the defending points champion and current 
points leader, was going to do anything but keep that lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, 40 laps later, Harper raced to an uncontested checkered flag, all 
but sewing up the 1990 Sportsman division points championship. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Spangler of Northridge tailed Harper all the while and took second place. 
Gary Sigman of Carson took third while Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, Harper's 
main challenger in the points standings after Reseda's Larry Krieger had to go 
to the back after an early spinout, took fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Richard Smith of Reseda won the 12-lap Jalopy main event. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hobby Stock oval main event, Oliver Aguilar of Sun Valley wowed the 
crowd by starting 22nd and blazing past the competition to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Flavin of West Hills took second. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Phipps started on the pole and held off all challengers to win an 
eight-lap Sportsman fast-heat race. John Cran of Reseda sustained heavy damage 
to his car in a pileup but was able to resume racing. 
</P>
<P>
In other fast-heat races, Flavin sneaked past Glen Whitton of Lancaster on Turn 
4 of the final lap to win the Hobby Stock oval, while Clay Forsythe of Palmdale 
trimphed in the Jalopy fast heat. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gunnarson of Reseda won the six-lap Hobby Stock figure-eight fast heat. 
</P>
<P>
In trophy dash races, Spangler won the six-lap Sportsman event after pole 
position driver spun out on the back straightaway of Lap 5. 
</P>
<P>
Other trophy dash winners included Russ Wolff of Glendale (Hobby Stock oval), 
Dick Leighton of Pacoima (Jalopy) and Mike McAtee of North Hollywood (Hobby 
Stock figure-eight). 
</P>
<P>
Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill set fast time again for Sportsman cars, racing 
the oval in 16.87 seconds. He holds the track record of 16.62 seconds.

CS NORTHRIDGE MAKES STRIDES BUT LOSES, 1-0; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: MATADORS PLAY UCLA EVEN UNTIL LATE IN AN EXHIBITION MATCH WHEN MOORE 
SCORES ON A PENALTY KICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a decade ago, UCLA scored nine goals against Cal State Northridge, the 
most a CSUN soccer team has surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, it took a penalty kick for the visiting Bruins to down Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-0 loss in an exhibition match before a crowd estimated at 1,700 
demonstrated how far CSUN's program has come, but Matador Coach Marwan Ass'ad 
still wouldn't settle for a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," he said. "We could have won the game. We had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
On the lone penalty kick of the match, Bruin midfielder Joe-Max Moore drilled 
the ball toward the right corner of the net. Northridge goalie Joel Entreken 
dived to his left, but the ball bounced off his arms and body and rolled in 67 
minutes into the 90-minute match. The kick was awarded after junior forward 
Gustavo Cardenas knocked Moore down in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, ranked third in a national coaches' preseason poll, finished with a 17-11 
advantage in shots on goal, 30-15 in overall attempts. But except for a handful 
of corner kicks that were headed away by Northridge defenders, the Bruins were 
limited to low-percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The question for me was, can our defense play?" Ass'ad said. "And I found out 
we can. Now we just need to work with the midfielders and the forwards and 
we'll be on course. Our team in the midfield can play so much better. 
</P>
<P>
"When we won the ball, we were poor, that was a major weakness today. I told 
them when we win the ball, one pass is good, two is great, so our challenge is 
to get off two passes." 
</P>
<P>
For example, CSUN players need look no farther than UCLA, which put on a clinic 
in terms of ball control and precision passing. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Coach Sigi Schmid allowed that his team dominated team play, but he 
wasn't pleased with the individual battles. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were patient and we had possession but Northridge won more of the 
one-on-one individual battles," Schmid said. "The last third of the field 
(offensive zone) we didn't look good. We tried things that were impossible. We 
weren't simple enough in that part of the field." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA sophomore midfielder Chris Henderson, a member of the U. S. World Cup 
team, was the sharpest Bruin inside 20 yards of the goal. In the first half 
alone, he got off a match-high four shots on goal. CSUN's defense tightened 
after halftime, however, holding him to two shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been on the team, this is the best exhibition we've played against 
UCLA," said junior defender Ed Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"Their goal was a penalty kick so that says something. And we had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Northridge's open-field scoring opportunities were sabotaged by 
offside violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the UCLA defense caused that more than anything," said 
Burns. "And two of our forwards are freshmen (Dominic Zapata and Armando 
Valdivia). They're fast but they were jumping the gun." 
</P>
<P>
Although it was an exhibition match, CSUN played it as though it counted. "We 
always take them seriously because we have something to prove," Burns said, 
"especially in the first year of Division I. To stand up to a contender, that 
says a lot for us." 
</P>
<P>
Several CSUN players went down with injuries but only Danny Daniels' sprained 
ankle appears to be serious. Daniels' status is uncertain for the season opener 
and the soccer team's Division I debut Saturday against visiting UC Irvine.

BUFFALO PLANS TO FOLLOW IN CSUN'S PATH NEXT YEAR IN AN EFFORT TO BOOST ITS

Whatever its record, the State University of New York, Buffalo, will be in the 
top 20. Nelson Townsend, the school's athletic director, is sure of it. 
</P>
<P>
No, not in basketball. Not in baseball, either. Not in athletics, period. In a 
word, academics. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo happens to be one of the nation's top universities in research. 
Unfortunately, such a distinction does little to swell the pride of the more 
than 28,000 students who attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prominent academically," Townsend said during an interview in his 
office a few months ago, "but there is a lack of excitement and involvement 
within the institution." 
</P>
<P>
Athletics, school officials believe, is partly to blame. "We are playing 
institutions at the Division III and Division II levels that none of our 
students can relate to," Townsend said. "We play some institutions that some 
people have never heard of, including myself." 
</P>
<P>
In a year, that will change. As of Sept. 1, 1991, Buffalo is scheduled to begin 
competing at the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I level in all 
sports but football. Buffalo and Cal State Northridge are among six schools set 
to join the major college ranks in the next two years, according to the NCAA. 
The others are Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Northeastern Illinois, both of which 
will make the move from Division II this year, and Southeast Missouri State and 
Cal State Sacramento, which will advance in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Like their Northridge counterparts, Buffalo administrators have chosen Division 
I athletics as a means to boost their school's image and increase student 
involvement. And if some extra money might come of it, well, that's fine too. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are 3,000 miles apart, the schools have similarities in addition 
to their reasons for the move and their broad-based athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's enrollment this school year is expected to exceed 31,000, a number 
Buffalo is fast approaching. Both are commuter schools located in urban 
settings. Therefore, they have plenty of competition when it comes to 
attracting a sports fan's dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo must contend with Syracuse and Penn State, along with the Sabres of the 
National Hockey League, the Bills of the National Football League and a popular 
triple-A baseball team called the Bison. Northridge is going up against USC, 
UCLA, the Kings, the Lakers, the Clippers, the Raiders and the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
In men's basketball, crowds at Buffalo home games have ranged from hundreds to 
nearly 5,000 in the past few years. The opponent seems to dictate the 
attendance more than Buffalo's win-loss record. Games against cross-town 
Buffalo State draw crowds 10 times the size of those for opponents such as Le 
Moyne. 
</P>
<P>
The sport doesn't seem to matter as long as familiar names are involved. In 
1988, a men's volleyball exhibition match between USC and top-ranked Penn State 
drew a crowd of 5,700 to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Penn State played the Puerto Rican national team before 3,000 at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Penn State playing the Puerto Rican nationals in volleyball and it 
outdrew a basketball game here the night before five to one," Townsend said. 
"That's because (Buffalo) was playing someone that nobody related to. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea here is that the competition level is important to the spirit of the 
institution. It gives the student population a rallying point, something they 
can identify with and of which they can be proud." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend predicts Buffalo regularly will play schools "with students our 
students feel are their peer group." This would include such opponents as 
Bucknell, Cornell, Lehigh, Lafayette, Massachusetts, Delaware and, 
occasionally, Penn State or Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell alumni that tomorrow you're going to play Findlay (Ohio) College in 
football and they say, 'Who? From where?' And then they beat you 35-0 and it's, 
'Who was that masked team?' " Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you realize that if you had been playing Cornell today. . . . the score 
still probably would have been 35-0, but it would have been a completely 
different experience." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend considers games against schools the size of Findlay no-win situations. 
"They walk away proud because they just beat that big University of Buffalo," 
he said, "and we're going home saying, 'Who was that we played?' 
</P>
<P>
"Division I is what we consider our peer group. This is a simplified reason, 
but we figure if we're going to be pounded by an unknown, we might as well be 
pounded by a known." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said he expects attendance to increase initially because of the 
upgrade in competition. But, he quickly added, "Buffalo, like any other 
institution, has to win." 
</P>
<P>
Half of the time probably would do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about 20-win seasons and making the NCAA Final Four," Townsend 
said. "But you have to play .500. We have examples locally of programs that are 
classified as Division I but are doormats in their own conferences. They aren't 
doing much better attendancewise than we are." 
</P>
<P>
Those examples include Niagara and St. Bonaventure, small private colleges with 
rich basketball traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Murphy played for Niagara from 1966-70 and led the Purple Eagles to the 
East regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament in his senior season. Bob 
Lanier played for St. Bonaventure from 1967-70 and the Bonnies advanced to the 
Final Four in his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were feared programs back in those days, but they've slipped in posture 
over the years and their attendance has slipped accordingly," Townsend said. 
"St. Bonaventure does OK in terms of attendance because it's the only game in 
town. You either go to bed or the basketball game. Here at Buffalo, people 
expect a little bang for their buck. You have to give a guy a reason to not go 
see the Sabres tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Northridge, Buffalo has competed at the major college level before. 
Clemson and Maryland were Buffalo opponents during the 1973-74 basketball 
season and the school's football schedule in 1967 included North Carolina State 
and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, amid Vietnam War protests, Buffalo dropped football 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"We were experiencing a serious state of unrest," Townsend said. "The students, 
always led by some faculty, of course, disbanded almost everything. The 
(university) was identified, rightly or wrongly, as the Berkeley of the East." 
</P>
<P>
Football was resurrected in 1977, at the same time the rest of the school's 
athletic teams were stripped of scholarships. For the next 10 years, Buffalo 
played at the Division III level. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Buffalo teams were moved to Division II and the school's Division I 
intentions were made public. Football will remain nonscholarship until the 1992 
season, and the university hopes to attain Division I-AA status the following 
season. 
</P>
<P>
For now, money is still a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years the students have increased their financial support 
significantly," Townsend said. "Not as significantly as Division I is going to 
require, but they have gone, without a lot of coercing, from the point in 1977 
when they said, 'Here's $15,000, guys. Go get a football team,' to now 
(annually) contributing well over $250,000." 
</P>
<P>
A recently adopted student tax increase is expected to push that figure well 
above $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge, each student is charged a $21 "associated students fee" per 
semester, of which athletics gets a $4 share to use for scholarships. Based on 
projected enrollment figures, the sum should be close to $250,000 for the 
upcoming school year. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN athletics also is granted money used for its daily operations through an 
"instructional related activities fee" of $15 per student each semester. A 
committee divides that money among such programs as the band, the student 
newspaper and KCSN radio, along with athletics. 
</P>
<P>
What Buffalo has that Northridge does not are on-campus athletic facilities 
that would be the envy of any West Coast university. 
</P>
<P>
The school has an indoor complex that includes two athletic facilities under 
one roof. The main venue includes a 10,000-seat arena for basketball, a 
1,500-seat swim stadium, two weight rooms, a dance studio, locker rooms, 
classrooms, offices, 14 handball and racquetball courts and a 1/6-mile jogging 
track. The second area has room for three regulation basketball courts and 
3,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 35,000-seat outdoor stadium and an additional competition pool 
-- both paid for by the state -- will be added before the school plays host to 
the 1993 World University Games. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has not been skimpy as far as athletic facilities," Townsend said. 
"They have left the fundamental, very basic requirements in place as far as 
what was appropriate to support us in Division II. Now they're saying, 'If you 
want to give scholarships, you find the money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's basketball team will have the NCAA Division I maximum of 15 
scholarships at its disposal in its first year. The school's wrestling, women's 
volleyball, men's and women's soccer and men's and women's swimming teams 
currently offer scholarships and expect to be funded next year at slightly 
above half of what NCAA guidelines allow. The rest of the school's sports won't 
begin offering grants until the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo will have the only Division I athletic program of New York's seven 
state universities. The rest are nonscholarship and compete in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Where the school will fit in among major colleges is a question Townsend often 
ponders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think we'll fit in somewhere in the middle ground," he said. "If 
you turn on your TV five years from now and see (Buffalo) in the (men's 
basketball) Final Four, it won't be by design. It will be because, by some 
great stroke of chemistry, we just couldn't help ourselves."

CITY, OPERATOR AT ODDS OVER LENGTH OF PERMIT TO STAGE RACES IN PARK

<P>
To Larry Hoffman, Weddington Park South in North Hollywood is the perfect place 
to hold a BMX race. 
</P>
<P>
It is accessible by freeway; it is bordered by the Los Angeles River, the 
Hollywood Freeway and a dead-end street to insulate it from noise complaints; 
and it is located in a depression out of the neighborhood's view. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Grade agrees, and the L. A. Recreation and Parks Department supervisor 
actually encouraged Hoffman to apply for a permit to use the park, located near 
Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
That much is clear, but the picture becomes cloudy when both sides discuss 
duration. Hoffman says the permit was for a year while Grade claims it was for 
a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of volunteers, Hoffman began grading the land three weeks ago and 
the track was almost completed last Monday when his phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
It was Martin Castillo, a maintenance supervisor for the city, informing 
Hoffman that his application had been voided after Councilman John Ferraro, 
whose Fourth District includes the site, expressed concern over the development 
over the park. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Presby, field deputy for Ferraro, said that her office received "numerous 
complaints" from residents in the area concerning noise and construction at the 
venue, which had been designated as a passive park and was not zoned for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a misunderstanding and the Recreation and Parks thought it was going 
to be for a weekend," Presby said. "There is no way we can give up land without 
a contract." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grade: "My understanding was that it was it was going to be a one-shot 
deal and when his application came in with one year on it, there was no way it 
could be approved. We grant one-day or weekend permits for carnivals and 
similar events despite the possibility of complaints. There's a big difference 
in holding title for the park and using it for a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a comedy of errors. He had one thing in mind and did not 
communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, who lives in North Hollywood and owns a bicycle shop there, agreed 
that he initially considered holding one weekend race in the park, but insists 
that Grade knew his application was going to be for a year and proposed the 
yearlong lease. 
</P>
<P>
"I still want a track somewhere," said Hoffman, who added that he has received 
close to 100 inquiries about the status of the track, which was scheduled to 
open in September. "I don't care if I run it or if the city runs it. I'm not 
into it to make a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Blowin' in the wind: Don Carey, 61, of Camarillo placed third in the 
40-kilometer time trial at the recent Masters national championships in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, who won the race in 1987 and holds the national record in the event 
(58:24, set in 1988), experienced difficulty with the winds and the hills on 
the out-and-back San Diego course. He finished in 1:04.47, 90 seconds behind 
winner William McClosky of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Carey is preparing for the World Senior Games in St. George, Utah, in October. 
He will compete in the 40-kilometer time trial. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Ron Skarin of Van Nuys and Eric Hollander of Marina del Rey set 
the one-hour world record for distance in a human-powered vehicle in 1980 at 
Ontario Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
The duo, beginning from a standing start, covered 46 miles, 537 yards in a 
fiberglass-enclosed tandem, recumbent bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
What is the record for maximum speed in an HPV? 
</P>
<P>
Face lift: If all goes as planned, Encino Velodrome won't be just for cycling 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Cycling Federation, which owns and operates the 
nonprofit velodrome, submitted a $725,000-plus renovation proposal two weeks 
ago to the Amateur Athletic Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The AAF was created to disburse surplus revenue from the 1984 Olympics. It also 
sponsors classes at the velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the wide-ranging proposal were resurfacing of the existing track 
and construction of a roller-hockey and speed-skating rink. Construction of 
locker-room facilities and renovation of the snack bar also were proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The AAF has expressed interest in the project and has agreed to provide 
matching funds. Cycling federation President Sandy Bevan said she is hoping to 
find corporate sponsorship by October to claim the AAF funds and have the 
improvements completed for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all starting to come together," Bevan said of the proposal, researched 
and formulated in large part by Dan Clinger, an architect who donated his time 
to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"(With the improvements), it would become an easy access cross-training 
facility. We'd be able to get much more use from the facility than is presently 
conceivable." 
</P>
<P>
Family affair: The Clinger family made respectable showings at the junior 
national championships in San Diego recently. 
</P>
<P>
David, 12, buoyed by a third-place finish in the points race, finished seventh 
in the omnium, which also included the 500- and 2,000-meter time trials and 
match sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Jr., 15, placed sixth and seventh in the 500- and 2,000-meter time trials 
and Jennifer, 13, was seventh in the 500-meter time trial. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tour of the Future in Bisbee, Ariz. last week, David placed seventh in 
the six-day, six stage, 135-mile race for ages 13-16. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Fred Markham of Aptos, Calif., reached a speed of 65.484 m.p.h. 
on a level course, unpaced and unaided by wind, at Big Sandflat, Calif., in 
1986 on a 31-pound recumbent bicycle. The cycle was enclosed to reduce wind 
resistance and the frame was constructed out of lightweight titanium and 
aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
Markham took approximately two miles to build up to top speed. 
</P>
<P>
Add juniors: Katie Beck, 17, of Simi Valley finished third in the 2,000-meter 
time trial and fourth in the match sprints and points race at the junior 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, a Simi Valley High senior who rides for the Quick Release Bicycle Club, 
also placed fifth in the individual pursuit and 40-kilometer road race and 
sixth in the criterium. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Skellenger, 17, of Thousand Oaks, winner of the Moreno Valley criterium 
last Sunday, placed third in the match sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Add tour: John Mutolo of Thousand Oaks (12th), Steve Province of Santa Clarita 
(46th) and Scott Neumann of Northridge (50th) paced the Chatsworth-based 
Rainbow Sports Team to 13th place in the team competition at the Tour of the 
Future in the age 17-18 division. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. national team won the team title of the eight-stage, 265-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Triple vision: With less than five weeks remaining in the Encino Velodrome 
racing season, three riders with the same first name are atop the senior men 
season point totals. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Johnson of Santa Barbara leads with 100 points, followed by Chris Bevan 
of Woodland Hills (70) and Chris Gaido of San Luis Obispo (54). 
</P>
<P>
Points are distributed for a top-five finish on a 7-5-3-2-1 basis.

TEAMWORK LEADS TO CYCLING WIN FOR BEVAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Bevan, Chris Gaido and Fred Markham broke away from the 14-rider field 
slightly more than halfway through the Jack Kemp Memorial 10-mile race at the 
Encino Velodrome on Saturday night, which made for pretty good odds for Bevan 
and Markham. 
</P>
<P>
"We planned before the race to work together," said Bevan, 19, of Woodland 
Hills. "We knew that Gaido is a good sprinter and we had to watch out for him." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy worked as Bevan pulled away from newfound teammate Markham and 
Gaido on the back straight of the final lap to win the 64-lap race in 21 
minutes 19.07 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Bevan's time smashed Ron Skarin's track record of 22:21.4. 
</P>
<P>
Markham held off Gaido for second, followed by Benjamin Swan and Butch Stinton. 
</P>
<P>
Bevan, Markham and Gaido broke away from the field on Lap 23 and exchanged the 
lead for the next 22 laps until Gaido took a slight advantage going into the 
bell lap. 
</P>
<P>
The race was named in memory of one of the original founders of the 29-year-old 
velodrome. Kemp died earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In another special race, Pushpita of the Indonesian national team emerged 
victorious in the inaugural Chuck Pranke Memorial sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Season points leader Chris Johnson placed second in the round-robin 
competition, followed by Scott Skellenger, Markham and Luis Alcaraz. 
</P>
<P>
Pranke, a sprinter on the 1968 U. S. Olympic team, helped promote races at the 
velodrome in the early 1970s, including the International Grand Prix of 
Cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Anderson won the miss-and-out and placed third in the points-and-scratch 
race to edge Cecil Hunte in senior men's omnium by a point, 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier events, Amandy Henry of the Montrose Cycle Club won the 
miss-and-out, points race and placed third in the scratch race to win the 
senior women's omnium with 17 points, ahead of Katie Horndon (16) and Dana 
Rogers (11).

MILLER DEMONSTRATES THAT HE'S LEARNED A LOTT

<P>
What's good for the parts may ultimately prove to be better for the whole. 
</P>
<P>
The matter at hand was a catch that could have serious repercussions not only 
for the player who caught it and the one who threw it, but also for rest of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in the second quarter at Jack Murphy Stadium. The Chargers were 
trailing the San Francisco 49ers, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
On first and 10 at San Diego's 29, Billy Joe Tolliver threw low over the 
middle, right into the waiting arms of 49er free safety Ronnie Lott, a man not 
known for turning away gift interceptions. But wait. Somehow, Anthony Miller, 
the man for whom the pass was intended all along, came up with the ball and a 
41-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
While the Chargers had to settle for a 26-yard field goal on the drive, the 
catch was, according to Charlie Joiner, the Chargers' receivers coach, the kind 
that can turn a team around. And in this case, it is a team already headed in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a breakthrough for him and a breakthrough for the quarterbacks," Joiner 
said. "And when you can make those kind of plays, it's a breakthrough for the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Joiner said Miller is beginning to learn how to read defenses, and for a player 
who didn't play much before he joined the Chargers -- he divided his time 
between football and track at Tennessee and missed five games his senior year 
because of a knee injury -- he's a little bit ahead of where Joiner would 
expect him to be at this point. 
</P>
<P>
And Joiner said it was the first time Miller has battled for a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something he hasn't done, or hasn't had to do," Joiner said. "Go up and 
fight for the ball. Now we see he can do that. Quarterbacks won't be afraid to 
put the ball up to him, even when he's covered." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he just knew he had to try and prevent the interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I had to go up and try to break it up at least," he said, "and then 
when I felt I had a chance to get it, I just went for the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lott: "He's got a chance to be one of the best receivers in football. He 
has speed, strength, runs good patterns, and he's very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who finished with eight catches for 143 yards, downplayed any talk that 
he was out to prove himself against a team that has Jerry Rice, considered by 
many to be the league's best receiver, and Lott, a perennial Pro Bowl player. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel like I want people to see that I can compete with (Rice)," he 
said. "Lott is a great defensive back, but I was just playing against him and 
trying to come up with a good play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joiner: "He played with confidence. He was up for the challenge, being 
across the field from Jerry Rice." 
</P>
<P>
Most grateful to Miller was Tolliver, who was saved not once but twice from 
having egg on his face for misthrown balls. 
</P>
<P>
"He can play the game," Tolliver said of Miller. "He made two excellent catches 
on passes that could have been intercepted."

Carlos Morales has spent the better part of a year anticipating and then living 
through the Greyhound bus strike. Jennifer Delora only recently discovered that 
there was a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Morales is a striking driver in San Diego. Delora was one of 13 passengers who 
angrily stomped off a Greyhound bus in the middle of the California desert 
earlier this month, claiming that their driver -- a non-union replacement hired 
weeks ago -- was nodding off to sleep on Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two stories illustrate how the Greyhound strike has managed to 
become increasingly painful while growing increasingly obscure. Everyone 
involved in it is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 6,000 Greyhound drivers who went on strike March 2 have gone on to 
other jobs, unable to survive on $50-a-week strike pay from the Amalgamated 
Transit Union -- a benefit that the union will no longer be able to afford in 
another month. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound, meanwhile, has kept America's only nationwide bus system rolling 
with 3,000 replacements and a public relations blitz that has convinced many 
people that the strike is over. Indeed, pickets at bus terminals are harder to 
spot. Sniping incidents that erupted in the first weeks of the strike have 
faded from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the strike goes on, with its stakes quietly rising. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has financially crippled Greyhound, forcing it into bankruptcy 
court, where it is temporarily protected from creditors. It has until Oct. 4 to 
submit a financial reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending is a potentially costly National Labor Relations Board complaint 
against Greyhound for unfair labor practices. It is due to be heard by an 
administrative law judge next month. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that Greyhound violated federal labor law by failing to 
negotiate in good faith before imposing new contract terms and giving 
preferential seniority to replacement drivers. If upheld, the complaint would 
force Greyhound to rehire the strikers and reimburse them tens of millions of 
dollars in back wages. 
</P>
<P>
Strikers are hoping that Greyhound's creditors will demand a financial 
reorganization plan that includes settlement of the NLRB complaint -- in effect 
dismissing the replacement drivers and hiring back the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
In case Greyhound cannot satisfy its creditors, the union is drafting a 
proposal to buy the bus system with financing from a New York investment 
banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that people such as Morales continue to cluster 
at sporadic anti-Greyhound rallies sponsored by union locals, holding out 
wistfully for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, 27, grew up in Texas. He worked for his father's plumbing company 
until the oil bust hit and work disappeared. In 1987, businessman Fred G. 
Currey bought Greyhound and began a campaign to increase ridership with lower 
fares. He also hired some new drivers. Morales was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Once Morales got behind the wheel, he was hooked. "I'm in heaven. I like to 
drive those buses," he said. The thought keeps him going today. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, a strike was already in the cards when Morales joined Greyhound. 
The union had struck before -- for seven weeks in 1983 -- but eventually 
accepted a 15% cut in wages and benefits over three years. In 1987, shortly 
before Currey bought the company, the union accepted another cut of 22%. All of 
this was done at management's insistence that costs needed to be slashed in an 
era of deregulation and heightened competition. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the 1987 contract expired last March, drivers were asking for some 
of the cuts to be restored. Currey was asking for more cuts. He wanted to trim 
vacation and sick leave and tie wage hikes to increased productivity. 
Negotiations went nowhere. Weeks before the strike, Greyhound began training 
replacement workers. 
</P>
<P>
Currey vowed to "rebuild" with replacements, attempting to become the latest in 
a string of companies that have tried to break strikes by effectively firing 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Greyhound says it is carrying 80% to 85% of the passengers it did at 
this time last year. Still, in many ways the Greyhound strike resembles the 
disastrous Eastern Airlines strike of 1989, in which management demanded 
concessions, hired replacement workers when a strike began and was subsequently 
forced into bankruptcy court by financial problems. Eventually, a bankruptcy 
court placed the airline under the control of a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound's managers, now operating with thousands fewer drivers and having 
slashed a number of unprofitable rural routes, insist that they can avoid such 
straits. 
</P>
<P>
And so the war of attrition continues. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't believe he (Currey) would take it this far," Morales said. "I 
thought maybe we'd be out a month." 
</P>
<P>
Morales saved his money in the months before the strike, allowing him to spend 
time on picketing activities for the first two or three months. Then the money 
struggle started. He went from one odd job to another. He drove a truck to 
Denver, fixed some friends' cars. 
</P>
<P>
He and other strikers still without jobs got a break in May when many states, 
including California, ruled that strikers could begin collecting unemployment 
benefits. Technically, the states said, the strikers became eligible in the 
third month of the strike, when their union offered to return to work under the 
old contract and resume bargaining. Greyhound turned the offer down. 
</P>
<P>
The driving jobs do not pay especially well -- $24,000 for 60 hours a week, 
drivers say. Nobody hired since 1983 has pension benefits. For all his loyalty, 
even Morales has inquired about a few other jobs recently. "You really have to 
get something (solid) when you're around 24 years old," he said. "That's why I 
jumped to Greyhound. They didn't have a pension, but I figured we'd get one at 
the next contract. Now I'm getting a little scared." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of striking and being permanently replaced has percolated throughout 
the labor movement. Last week, after 146,000 United Parcel Service employees 
ratified a new contract against the recommendation of their Teamsters union 
leaders, Teamster President William J. McCarthy speculated that many workers 
voted for the contract because they were "frightened by management's ability to 
use permanent replacement workers . . . in the possible event of a strike." 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor has thrown considerable muscle into promoting a bill in 
Congress that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements 
during a strike. However, it is given little chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound strikers are discouraged that news media people stopped visiting the 
picket lines after the first few weeks of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come by our rallies and say, 'I thought you settled it," 
Morales said glumly. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Delora thought. A 28-year-old actress who moved to Beverly Hills 
earlier this year from New York, Delora wasn't aware that there had been a 
strike in the first place. Two weekends ago she wanted to visit a friend in Las 
Vegas, but she hadn't yet bought a car and couldn't schedule the right air 
connections. So she paid $70 for a round trip on Greyhound on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
When the bus was west of Baker, according to a letter of complaint signed by 
Delora on behalf of herself and 12 other passengers, the Greyhound driver began 
to swerve from one lane to another and back. 
</P>
<P>
"His head was down. He'd obviously nodded off. Everybody on the bus was 
panicking. We were asking him to pull off the road," she said in an interview. 
"I walked up to the front of the bus and asked him if he'd stop, maybe get a 
cup of coffee. I told him I was going to get sick if the bus kept swerving. He 
said, 'Then get sick.' We were really frightened." 
</P>
<P>
"His eyes were shut tight; he was asleep," said another passenger, Dorris 
Morrison of Van Nuys. "We could see ourselves crashing. We were screaming, 
asking him to stop the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Several miles east of Baker, the driver stopped the bus because of a mechanical 
problem. The 37 passengers got off. Delora, Morrison and 11 others refused to 
reboard. Reluctantly, the driver continued to Las Vegas after a sheriff's 
deputy took the recalcitrant passengers back to Greyhound's Baker depot. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Dunn said the driver, who she said reported the 
incident to supervisors in Las Vegas, denied having fallen asleep. He 
acknowledged that the bus swerved over a lane, but said that happened because 
he was leaning over to hit a switch to correct an engine overheating problem, 
Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said the driver believed that Delora and the others "panicked" and 
misinterpreted his behavior. "We're sorry that people were afraid, but they 
should not have been afraid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Delora acknowledged some embarrassment when a reporter whom she telephoned 
about the incident informed her that Greyhound was being struck and was relying 
on replacement drivers, whose training has been criticized as inadequate by the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"I had absolutely no idea there was a strike. If I'd known, I never would have 
gotten on the bus," she said. "I'm a union actress. I don't promote this 
(strike-breaking)."

Greyhound -- An Aug. 26 article on the Greyhound bus strike said the National 
Labor Relations Board had charged the company with bargaining in bad faith in 
negotiations with the union representing Greyhound's drivers and maintenance 
and clerical workers. The NLRB did file an unfair-labor-practices complaint 
against the company, but the complaint did not include a bad-faith-bargaining 
allegation. The complaint is awaiting a hearing before an administrative law 
judge.

BOOKS: KURT VONNEGUT PAINTS A BLEAK PORTRAIT OF 20TH-CENTURY AMERICAN SOCIETY. 
'HOCUS POCUS,' HIS LATEST NOVEL, IS FILLED WITH MORAL OUTRAGE ABOUT THE 'RULING 
CLASS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kurt Vonnegut is sitting poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel, talking about the 
destruction of the species. 
</P>
<P>
Not the species in the immediate environs -- the healthy-to-the-teeth 
Hollywoodians in bathing trunks and sun-back dresses who are hooked to 
cream-colored telephones like large bronzed fish hanging onto tasty bait. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, the patio's pastel peach booths have become ersatz office 
suites, murmurous with deals. Occasionally, a polite splash stirs silver-gilt 
wavelets in the aquamarine swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Playing his usual role of dour curmudgeon, Vonnegut appears in the scene as a 
doomsayer in paradise. Shaggy-headed among the perfectly pruned orbs of 
hibiscus trees, he is perspiring in his visiting-Easterner khaki trousers and 
long-sleeved shirt. After a stoic 10 minutes he has predictably given up on the 
sports jacket, draping it over the back of the banquette. 
</P>
<P>
"God himself is not a great conservationist," he begins to snort. "Look at 
this. If the desert was so great, why did they do this?" 
</P>
<P>
Still it's more than the topiaries and suntans that have got the author in a 
funk. Vonnegut is more pessimistic than ever about the future of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think life is very funny anymore. . . . You come to hate life and 
that's bad. 
</P>
<P>
"But here I am at the pool. . . ." The Vonnegutian irony of his situation sets 
off a chain of deep, croaking, smoker's-cough chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
Visibly successful as a veteran critic of Homo sapiens follies, Vonnegut 
acknowledges, "I'm one of the best-known writers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
And now he's come to Hollywood to make some lucrative picture deals. The 
English movie company Handmade Films, headed by former Beatle George Harrison, 
has optioned his 1973 novel "Breakfast of Champions," Showtime/The Movie 
Channel is producing half a dozen of his short stories for cable television 
syndication, and he's lunching with a representative from Turner Network 
Television to discuss narrating a feature film on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, his 13th novel, "Hocus Pocus," is being published by G.P. Putnam 
this week. Typically, it's chock full of moral outrage, this time against what 
he terms "the ruling class." 
</P>
<P>
Set in the year 2001, the book satirizes social conditions in late 20th-Century 
America, using the metaphors of a burgeoning prison population and the stagnant 
student body of a school for the mentally disabled progeny of the country's 
business barons. The protagonist, Eugene Debs Hartke, is alternately part of 
the two institutions, which face each other across an abysmal valley and 
eventually collide. 
</P>
<P>
Hartke, who is the purported author of the book, writes on available scraps of 
paper, denoted in the novel by lined-off narration, which allows Vonnegut 
freewheeling commentary on everything from the evacuation of personnel from the 
American Embassy in Saigon (Hartke is a Vietnam veteran) to the fact that he 
has killed exactly as many people as he has had sex with, a coincidence that 
causes him to question his atheism. 
</P>
<P>
The central theme of the book, however, is "the tail-end of imperialism," which 
Vonnegut believes is represented by the descendants of the Anglos "who 
conquered this part of the world which became the United States." 
</P>
<P>
According to his thesis, these heirs to imperialism get tired of trying to 
manage all their property and the increasingly prison-prone population. So when 
the cash-heavy Japanese come along, they readily sell out rather than continue 
to take responsibility for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"What I say is that they revealed themselves to be no more patriots of where 
they live than did the British who took over Rhodesia or the Belgians who took 
over the Congo or the Portuguese who took over Mozambique," says Vonnegut. 
</P>
<P>
The author is speaking of America's white male conservatives, whom he sees as 
imperialists in their own country. "For them, the blacks and Hispanics are not 
their brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us are not descended from people who came from the British empire" and 
do not fit into a hierarchy based on the British class system, he maintains. 
"It's quite exasperating. This totally alien idea has been transferred to this 
country. The lower social orders are parasites; the people at the top with the 
nice manners are the most highly evolved animals so far. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) the American scheme is dependent on our seeing all of us as brothers and 
sisters." Despite such passionate oratory (Vonnegut is a frequent speaker on 
college campuses. "I go into exhibitionistic overdrive," he quips), he has no 
particular solution for social reform. "I simply look in astonishment at what 
people do." 
</P>
<P>
As a novelist, he has been looking at society and commenting on it since his 
first book, "Piano Player," appeared in 1951, predicting the consequences of 
automation in the business world. In his two best-known works, "Slaughterhouse 
Five" (1969) and "Cats Cradle" (1963), disparate destruction comes by fire and 
ice: the American World War II bombing of Dresden (Vonnegut was held prisoner 
in a slaughterhouse during the city's holocaust) and the freezing of the 
Earth's waters. Later, in "Galapagos" (1985), he muses on man as an 
evolutionary failure. 
</P>
<P>
Now Vonnegut is worried about losing his sense of humor. In past months he has 
noted that he no longer felt like making jokes and described "Hocus Pocus" as 
"a sardonic fable in a bed of gloom." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in past years, critics have sporadically remarked that Vonnegut's 
disenchantment was losing its punch. Reviewing "Deadeye Dick" in 1982, the 
Washington Post's chief literary critic, Jonathan Yardley, called him "the bard 
of flower power," linked to the decade of the 1960s, while a Chicago Tribune 
review by English professor and critic John W. Aldridge speculated that his 
last novel, "Bluebeard" (1987), signaled "a new and vital phase of his career" 
after a post-'60s slippage of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut shrugs off these observations. The tumble from amused observer to 
anguished moralist has been the fate of other American humorists -- Mark Twain, 
James Thurber and Ambrose Bierce, he comments self-comfortingly. 
</P>
<P>
He concedes, however: "I realize I'm taking life too seriously and that this is 
a mistake. It's a form of humorlessness to believe that the United States can 
be made into a kind of Utopia, or that white-collar criminal activity matters. 
It doesn't matter to most people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very numb society right now and I'm feeling too much. It's foolish. 
It's high school all over again. In high school I would be writing and athletes 
would say, 'Come on and have some fun. It's all too serious what the student 
council is doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Vonnegut is weary of unfriendly conservatives who, he says, paint 
a picture of him as a heretically "gloomy Gus, as if that's no way for an 
American to be. All I've done is paid attention to the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut began paying attention to science and sociology as the child of 
Midwestern intellectuals of German stock who entertained ideas of an ideal 
American society. Raised in Indianapolis, he studied chemistry at Cornell 
University and earned an M.A. in anthropology at the University of Chicago, 
while his older brother, Bernard, became a physicist. 
</P>
<P>
Since these student days, Vonnegut has been friends with scientists and has 
been listening to what they say about the environment. "We've turned the whole 
place into an Auschwitz," he declares. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what he hears about the atmosphere, the water, the topsoil, Vonnegut 
forecasts "the destruction of larger animals" will be occurring soon. "I would 
say 100 years is a long time for us to last. But people were saying this in the 
age of the Pharaohs; they were making a living saying the world was about to 
end. Except we have some pretty decent evidence now." 
</P>
<P>
While his scientific friends discuss the world's end dispassionately, Vonnegut 
continues to sound the alarm against self-annihilation for a young readership 
composed principally of high-school and university students. 
</P>
<P>
"I influence people when they have no immune system against ideas," he says. 
"Then they achieve power. They become president of the chamber of commerce or 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"John F. Kennedy was obviously a product of the books he read when he was 
young. We all are." 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut's influence and caring have flourished, he acknowledges, in the ease 
of a free and prosperous society. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people find life so hard and themselves so disappointing that they don't 
care whether (the world) ends or not." 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut, on the other hand, owns a four-story townhouse in Manhattan -- with a 
"three-windows-wide" view of the East River, he specifies -- and a weekend home 
in pricey, pastoral Bridgehampton, Long Island, where he enthusiastically 
gardens ("I just got into Brussels sprouts . . . and had great luck with 
broccoli.") 
</P>
<P>
He has seven children: three by his first wife, three adopted relatives and a 
7-year-old daughter, Lily, adopted by Vonnegut and his second wife, 
photographer Jill Krementz. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Smith-style capitalism has been good to him ("I wrote my books, put them 
on the market and became well known"), and Malcolm Forbes, whom Krementz 
regularly photographed, makes a cameo appearance in Vonnegut's new novel with 
his Harley motorcycle gang, wearing crash helmets decorated with dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
In a Franklin Library limited edition of "Hocus Pocus," the frontispiece will 
picture a Forbes-like biker accompanied by an Elizabeth Taylor-type in the 
buddy seat. 
</P>
<P>
As for business around the Beverly Hills swimming pool, Vonnegut allows his 
pleasure to break through the cosmic gloom. He congenially swaps tennis 
pointers with a noted scriptwriter, waves to a director or two, and sounds 
unabashedly ebullient about the prospects of a film being produced from his 
work. "It's always exciting to have a movie made," he says with a full-sun 
grin. "It's like a nice party."

BORSCHT BELT TIGHTENS IN THE CATSKILLS;

THE TIMES CHANGED, BUT THE RESORTS DIDN'T, LEADING TO THE END OF AN ERA IN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Monday night in the Borscht Belt, and a freak summer fog hangs over the 
Catskill Mountains, heavy as a potato pancake. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightclub of the old Granit Hotel, a pooped crowd of senior citizens 
waits for the King of Shtick to arrive. Suddenly, a four-piece band wakes them 
up with "Smile Though You're Heart Is Breaking," and Mal Z. Lawrence struts on 
stage like some wise guy at a bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
"Food is a big thing here in the Catskills, isn't it?" says the balding 
comedian, rolling into his routine. "People eat like there's no tomorrow. You 
check in as a human being and check out as cargo. Bellboy! Checkout time! Put a 
forklift under the Epsteins!" 
</P>
<P>
Laughter erupts in the largely Jewish crowd, as Lawrence paces back and forth, 
snapping the microphone cord behind him. Do they want jokes about sex and 
heartburn? They'll get, they'll get. 
</P>
<P>
"We need gambling up here," he continues. "And oh, what slot machines they 
would have at this hotel! No cherries, no oranges. Prunes! You get three prunes 
in a row and then you can go to the crap tables. When you gamble here, they're 
going to clean you out one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
Boom! goes the drum. The audience howls. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear about Pia Zadora? She was appearing in the Broadway play, 'The 
Diary of Anne Frank,' and she was so bad that when the Nazis come to the house, 
the entire audience stood up and yelled: She's in the attic." 
</P>
<P>
The curtains close to heavy applause and Lawrence hustles backstage to his tiny 
dressing room. It's got a broken chair, a toilet, a cracked mirror and one wire 
hanger dangling from the wall. Fancy it's not, but who's complaining? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a living," sighs Lawrence, who has worked the hotels here for 35 years. 
"It's just not the kind of living it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, the Catskill Mountains region was one of the nation's most 
famous summer playgrounds -- a Jewish Garden of Eatin' only 90 miles north of 
New York City. It was a place where kids could breathe sweet country air and 
families spent nights together under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Call it Shangri-La with schmaltz, a land of green hills and shimmering lakes 
where some of the biggest names in show business got their start. Danny Kaye, 
Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Jerry Lewis and Jackie Mason. In the Sour Cream 
Sierras, they said, a man could let his pants out and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the Catskills have fallen on times harder than day-old bagels. 
</P>
<P>
The swank hotels that once numbered more than 100 have dwindled to a dozen. 
Bungalow colonies that once housed thousands are crumbling. Summer camps that 
kept city kids out of trouble are long gone. Families that once visited the 
mountains every year now spend their money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As for the entertainers who once graced the marquees up here, don't ask. Today, 
most big names work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Time just passed this area by," says Stefan Kanfer, a senior editor at Time 
magazine who wrote "A Summer World," a social history of the Borscht Belt. 
"There has never been a domain like it, but tastes change. After awhile, people 
wanted more from a vacation than 15 kinds of herring and sour cream." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the mid-'60s, Kanfer says, people who made regular trips to the 
mountains suddenly had more options. For about the same money, couples could 
fly to Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, Miami and even California. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a trend repeated across America, the extended families that once 
streamed into the Catskills began breaking up. These days, children often live 
miles from their parents and rarely take long vacations with them. 
</P>
<P>
The last nail in the coffin was the advent of television and affordable home 
air-conditioning in the mid-1950s. New Yorkers who craved a night out and 
dreaded the long hot summer no longer needed the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's enough to make you cry," says Lawrence, packing his bags after the 
performance in Kerhonkson. "You know, the world is moving so damn fast." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most disturbing symbol of decay is the fall of Grossingers, the 
region's most luxurious hotel, first opened in 1913. Last month, owners filed 
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, hoping to auction off the deteriorating 600-room 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Grossinger, may she rest in peace, once presided over the hotel like a 
Jewish grandmother. She ensured there was enough seltzer on the tables and 
looked the other way when visitors put extra pastries in their purse for the 
long ride home. It was a family business that grew into an empire. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, Grossingers was a magnet for celebrities and politicians, a place 
to see and be seen. Legend has it that Eddie Fisher was discovered there and 
that the mambo was first introduced to America in the huge ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
But like so many other hotels here, Grossingers failed to keep up with changing 
times. As competition for tourist dollars increased, the financial burdens 
became too great and the Grossinger children gave up the business. The decline 
of their hotel has cast a pall over the region, and old-timers still can't 
believe that the once sumptuous grounds are overrun with weeds.

"People up here were shocked when Grossingers finally closed," says Raymond 
Drillich, a Holocaust survivor who has been a waiter at the nearby Concord 
Hotel for 40 years. "The way things are going, I don't know if this area will 
continue to be so heavily Jewish for much longer." 
</P>
<P>
If Drillich is right, and his fears are echoed by other observers, it could 
mean the end of an era in American and Jewish cultural history. As the old 
Yiddish saying puts it: Vos is gewehn is gewehn! (What's past is past.) 
</P>
<P>
It all began about 1900, when a handful of Jewish farmers who had moved up to 
the mountains from New York City found it tough to make a living from the 
region's rocky soil. They hit on the idea of renting out spare rooms to 
relatives from the city. Soon, a tourist boom was under way. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the picturesque land was a haven for thousands of Jewish immigrants 
who wanted to escape the grit and grime of their overcrowded tenements. The 
mountains offered serenity, green grass and fresh, hearty food at poor man's 
prices. Families mingled with their own, spoke Yiddish without fear of 
harassment and maintained a bit of the Old World in the new. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, more affluent tourists began visiting the area and the face of the 
Catskills changed forever. In 30 years, the region was covered with large 
hotels, bungalow colonies and scores of summer camps. The annual tourist count 
reached more than one million beginning in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Although some sections of the Catskills catered to Italian-, Greek- and 
Spanish-speaking guests, the majority of tourist spots were patronized by 
Jewish visitors. It was common for hotels and bungalows to offer Friday night 
Sabbath services and special observances for the High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
But the new tourists also craved entertainment, and proprietors began hiring 
scores of comedians and other performers. In the beginning, they had names like 
Aaron Chwatt, Bernie Schwartz and Murray Janofsky. They later became known as 
Red Buttons, Tony Curtis and Jan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, entertainment was nonstop. Even the smallest bungalow had its 
own toomler, or social director, who was in charge of keeping guests happy and 
organizing activities. A typical week included swimming, hiking, dancing, 
calisthenics, costume parties and eating. Lots of eating. 
</P>
<P>
Sex and romance was the second most popular activity. Many of the waiters and 
busboys who worked for the summer in hotels went on to become doctors, lawyers 
and, in some cases, show-biz celebrities. For some folks, this created a 
matchmaking opportunity made in heaven. What mother could pass up the chance to 
introduce her girl to a future surgeon, even though he cleaned silverware every 
night? What young man on the prowl didn't dream that he would meet the daughter 
of a millionaire? 
</P>
<P>
False identities were popular and elaborate courting rituals took place in 
dining halls. Men and women saved for an entire year to bring two weeks worth 
of new clothes to the Catskills. And it paid off: Today, there are thousands of 
couples who met and married in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
At its height in the 1940s and '50s, the region raked in millions of dollars a 
year from tourism. The mountains had come a long way from the days when poor 
immigrants traveled up by train and ate simple dinners of borscht, the hearty 
beet soup which gave the region its name. 
</P>
<P>
But today, it's a different story. Tourism officials in Sullivan County, the 
heart of the Catskill region, say it has tremendous potential for economic and 
residential growth. They concede, however, that the good old days of mostly 
Jewish hotels and sprawling bungalow colonies are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
Coming here is still a bargain: Families pay one flat fee for their rooms, 
three meals a day, athletic activities including golf, tennis and swimming, 
plus entertainment at night. You should live so long to find a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel owners, however, are after bigger game. The Concord has actively courted 
convention business; signs on a recent weekend there welcomed not only Jewish 
couples but also the directors of Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Catskills Hotel Assn. has given the Borscht Belt a new name -- 
"CatskilLand" -- and its members recently launched a $200,000 television 
advertising campaign to play down the area's ethnic image. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some of the hotels that once served kosher food are abandoning that 
tradition. Menus that were once translated into Hebrew now appear in other 
languages, like Japanese. That's because the region's golf courses attract 
hundreds of Asian guests, says Milton Kutsher, who runs Kutshers Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish is fish, and the Japanese tourists enjoy the food up here like anybody 
else," he explains. "The time has come when you can't make it just by catering 
to the ethnic crowd. Today, you have to broaden your appeal." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the changes, there are still pockets where the old Catskill spirit 
survives. In some ways, the region hasn't changed much at all. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the tourists these days are seniors, who come from as far away as 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Florida. But there are also groups of young Orthodox 
families and singles who visit the mountains on special weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Although mainstream entertainers like Tom Jones and Jay Leno dominate Saturday 
night bookings, visitors can still catch traditional performers like Lawrence. 
And the Jewish ambience has not disappeared entirely, with hundreds of Hasidic 
families moving into bungalows once occupied by seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pick up the old feeling if you know where to look for it," says Howie 
Pepper, who sold his Jewish record store in Los Angeles 40 years ago and moved 
to the mountains to try his luck as a comic. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things are still the same, like 50 years ago. Like the eating. My God, 
the way people eat in the mountains. Essing and fressing (eating and gobbling) 
all day long. Like they were about to go to the electric chair." 
</P>
<P>
An hour ago, when dinner was first served at the Concord Hotel, Raymond Frantz 
attacked the chicken matzo ball soup, polishing off two bowls in nothing flat. 
That was followed by salad, sour pickles, carrot sticks, black olives, onions, 
bread, more salad, more bread, and then, more salad. 
</P>
<P>
When they put a steaming plate of beef flanken in front of him, he groaned a 
little, let out his pants, but kept eating. When they asked him if he wanted 
another plate, or a different main course, he grunted yes and kept on chewing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's time for dessert, and all eyes at the table are on the 70-year-old 
man from Brooklyn. Calmly, the waiter asks him if he wants Hungarian apple 
strudel, coconut candy macaroons, Swiss pineapple roulade or lime fruit ice. 
Frantz seems offended by the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Put them all down here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the Catskill Mountains, hotel owners still crawl out of their skins to keep 
people like Frantz happy. He came here for the weekend on a package deal that 
includes all the food he can eat, and the owners mean it. Their sprawling 
kitchen serves up to 3,000 kosher meals at one time. Does he want more strudel? 
Right away! Three more pieces of gefilte fish? No problem! 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way since the turn of the century. Then as now, people come to 
the Catskills to eat, but also to laugh. Veteran waiters in the remaining 
hotels still serve up jokes along with big bowls of cole slaw and fruit. Who 
needs a nightclub when even the busboy thinks he's Milton Berle? 
</P>
<P>
Take Sam Freiberg. Please. He's been waiting tables at the Concord for 25 
years. Every night, he pretends to spill coffee on visitors and pulls other 
gags to keep them laughing. With Sam, there's no such thing as a simple meal. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the waiters are old-timers. Even though the future doctors and 
lawyers of America no longer flock to the region for jobs, there are still some 
bright-eyed kids who are lured by the magic of summer in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wasserman, 19, came all the way from Encino. What's a nice Jewish boy 
from the Valley doing in the Concord Hotel? To hear him tell it, the experience 
has been bizarre but priceless. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in life prepares you for the moment when 200 families are screaming 
for bread on their tables at once," he says. "Everybody here is eating, or 
recovering from eating. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
At a nearby table, a daughter is urging her mother to take a walk and work off 
some excess calories. The two are surrounded by dishes of half-eaten food. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Ma, it'll be good for you," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave me alone," the mother answers. "I already get enough exercise walking 
from my bedroom to the dining room." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the meal, public announcements remind guests of upcoming activities, 
like aerobics with Gilda, dancing lessons with Sol and Sharon and a hair 
replacement seminar with Ralph Levine. 
</P>
<P>
The last event draws a big crowd outside the dining room. Levine, a paunchy 
Long Island businessman, is promoting a line of toupees and stands behind a man 
with an apparently full head of hair. In a booming voice, he tells the audience 
that he never asks customers if they're satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"You know why? I'll tell you why," he says, yanking a wig off the bald man's 
head and producing audience gasps. "I don't have to ask him if he likes it. 
Believe me, he loves it." 
</P>
<P>
In the Concord's famous walkway, a Latin dance band keeps couples twirling to 
the cha-cha until 1 a.m. For singles, there's a late-hour splash and swim. 
</P>
<P>
But the night's main event is comedian Sal Richards, a fast-talking Italian 
comic who has played the mountains for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
During his routine, he shakes off hecklers and does a mean Tom Jones 
impression. When someone throws a brassiere at him from the audience, he wraps 
it across his face and says: "Welcome to General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Richards asks if there are any Italians in the audience, and when a few hands 
go up, he says: "Why?" The audience breaks up. 
</P>
<P>
The next evening, "Tonight" show host Jay Leno draws a large crowd but doesn't 
get quite the same reception. His routine sparkles but has no ethnic jokes. 
Midway through his set, a few elderly people get up to leave. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as no surprise to Gladys Weisman, who is sunning herself the next 
morning by the hotel's sprawling pool. Weisman has been coming to the mountains 
for years, she wasn't born yesterday, and she knows what sells. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic material is still very big up here, no matter what kind it is," Weisman 
says, smearing suntan lotion on her legs. "It's like when Latin dancing was the 
big thing here, and the mambo craze was just getting hot." 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, she explains, the mountain hotels tried to outdo each other by 
signing up famous mambo bands. There were hundreds of Latin musicians working 
in the area and an equally large contingent of female hotel guests whose 
husbands worked in the city from Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, come on, you had all these guys running around the mountains," says 
Weisman with a laugh. "Who do you think carried on with them during the week?" 
</P>
<P>
If adults had their own rituals, so did youngsters. For them, the Catskills 
were mountain lakes, camp fires, basketball games and countless chances to make 
mischief, free from their parents' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Richard Evans wrote about a typical day in the mountains for his 
eighth-grade class in New York City when he got back from vacation. To the best 
of his recollection, the essay went something like: 
</P>
<P>
"Woke up, had breakfast. Triple portions. Went for a walk. Came back from the 
walk. Went upstairs and got ready for lunch. Had lunch, triple portions. Took 
another walk. Went to the pool, took a nap at 3 p.m. Got ready for dinner, had 
dinner. Triple portions. Took another walk, played bingo, went to sleep. Got up 
the next day and had breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
In between naps and walks, Evans, now 40, says he learned all about nature: "I 
never would have known what a salamander was except for the Catskills. I lived 
in the city. Who knew from frogs?" 
</P>
<P>
Evans, whose uncle owned one of the biggest hotels in the mountains, the 
now-defunct Evans Hotel in Loch Sheldrake, last visited the region in 1979. He 
was depressed to see that extended families like his own were gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a world that passed away," he says. "You once spent summers here with 
your family, your cousins and your uncles. And now that's history." 
</P>
<P>
But not entirely. The old family feeling can still be found just across the 
road from the Concord Hotel, on a little hill overlooking Lake Kiamesha. 
</P>
<P>
The Har Nof Bungalow Colony used to be called the Krauss Colony, catering to 
seniors. But these days it is home to 80 Hasidic families from Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Under tall, spreading trees, a swarm of children ride tricycles and chase each 
other between rows of refurbished white bungalows. Their mothers sit in a 
cluster of lawn chairs, kibbitzing away the hours and watching them play. 
Devora Kozlik, a mother of five, explains that most of the husbands work during 
the week in New York and visit their families on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"We come out here every July and August for the children, so they'll have a 
chance to play in the country and escape the city," Kozlik says. "It's also a 
chance for us to be together, because a lot of us are friends. We can enjoy a 
peaceful time up here with very little stress. 
</P>
<P>
"We're part of a continuing tradition," she says. "There will always be some 
families that come to the Catskills. You don't have to look that hard." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, tradition is as close as an old chaise lounge. 
</P>
<P>
By the Concord pool, a family that includes Murray and Lenore Weiss, their 
daughter, Beth, and her husband, Steve Scheuer, and their three children soak 
up the morning rays. Murray says they've been coming every year for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is lousy but you get a lot of it," he jokes. "And where else could I 
take these three angels and have such fun?" he adds, pointing to his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her husband does during the day, Beth smiles and says, "He eats, and 
he eats and he eats some more." She rubs suntan oil on his belly, which is 
getting a little soft around the middle, and adds: "He didn't look this way 
when he was playing ball years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Scheuer says she enjoyed her summers here as a girl and hopes her children will 
come back to the mountains one day with their own families. But she realizes 
that times are different. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that the mountains have changed. It's me that's changed. I used to be 
more athletic, and now I just lay on the lounge. Now, you watch your kids do 
the things you used to do." 
</P>
<P>
She gives her husband one last smear of oil and pats his stomach. "The nicest 
things about this place," Scheuer says, "are the memories." 
</P>

DUST BOWL REUNION BRINGS SURVIVORS A FLOOD OF MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES HILLINGER

<DATELINE>

LAMONT, Calif. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The terrible drought that forced a half-million desperate farmers and their 
families to migrate to California from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Missouri 
in the 1930s was vividly recalled at a Dust Bowl Days reunion here recently. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people -- including many who lived through the wrenching 
experience, and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- spent 
the day in Lamont Park renewing acquaintances, looking at old photographs, 
exchanging stories. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood Risner, 75, and his wife Vergie, 66, who live in this small farm center 
15 miles southeast of Bakersfield, brought memorabilia of years spent living in 
the Sunset Migrant Labor Camp here. The camp was the scene of John Steinbeck's 
classic 1939 novel "Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
Risner came to California with his parents, 17 brothers and sisters from 
Durant, Okla. His wife, one of nine children -- one was born on the way -- came 
from Ada, Okla. The year was 1931. 
</P>
<P>
As a young girl Vergie Risner weighed cotton to help feed her large family. She 
brought to the reunion her old hand-fashioned cotton weigher, the family 
washtub, a quilt her mother made in camp in 1935, a washboard with homemade lye 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you we had hard times," she recalled. "My father lost his farm in 
Oklahoma when the drought and Depression hit at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we arrived in Lamont, Daddy went to work picking cotton for five cents an 
hour. So did my brothers and sisters. Somehow we got by. We didn't starve. We 
made our clothes out of chicken feed sacks." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smith, 54, a retired California Highway patrolman who lives in 
Bakersfield, came west in 1936 in a dilapidated old car with his mother and 
grandparents from Porum, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"As a little kid, I didn't know what poor meant. I thought everyone lived in a 
camp and picked cotton," he mused. 
</P>
<P>
All the old tin shacks, tents and other structures erected at the Sunset Camp 
during the 1930s and '40s have long since disappeared. But the site continues 
to this day as a migrant labor camp, with its residents mostly Latino farm 
workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The Dust Bowl descendants sat around in the park on lawn chairs. They feasted 
on barbecued tri-tip roast, listened to down-home tunes played by musicians who 
lived in the camps. Mostly, they talked -- for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Judd brought a poem his father, Dick Judd, wrote in Sunset Camp in 1938 
after following the crops that year throughout the Southwest. The last stanza 
read: 
</P>
<P>
 And after the cotton was over, to California we must go 
</P>
<P>
 Where Uncle Sam would feed us, of course, he does you know 
</P>
<P>
 We found the people friendly and ready to lend a hand 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the states we had worked in, by this one we will stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Weddell, 56, Lamont librarian, has been collecting every book, magazine 
and newspaper clipping she can lay her hands on for the Dust Bowl Room in the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping for a new library with a wing devoted to our Dust Bowl collection 
that will be both library and museum filled with 1930s artifacts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the reunion was that of Sharon Garrison, 44, a cotton gin 
bookkeeper, and Jim Phillips, 48, a barber, both of Lamont, and both products 
of the Sunset Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Stella White, 72, who came from Oklahoma in 1936, told Claudis Conley, 73, who 
arrived from Auroa, Mo., a year later: "We lived under a walnut tree that first 
summer drawing water from a standpipe." 
</P>
<P>
Then Conley recalled: 
</P>
<P>
"We camped under a tree our first summer, too. We drove out in our Model T. It 
had a big hole in a tire all the way but we still made it." 
</P>
<P>
Sue White, 50, who came to the reunion from Willows in Northern California, 
recalled how other people "considered us dirt, because we lived in tin shacks 
and tents, wore tattered clothes and chopped cotton and picked grapes and sugar 
beets. 
</P>
<P>
"But out of that experience has come judges, doctors, business leaders, land 
owners, the civic and political leaders of the San Joaquin Valley."

COMPTON LATINOS SAY SCHOOL BOARD ACTION SHOWS BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Latino leaders say the Compton school board's appointment of J. L. Handy as 
superintendent is one more example of the "systematic discrimination" against 
Latinos in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos campaigned for acting superintendent Elisa L. Sanchez to be promoted to 
the top job. But the Board of Trustees on Aug. 17 selected Handy, who is black, 
to head the Compton Unified School District. Six of the seven trustees are 
black; the other is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez will return to her previous job as deputy superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"What qualifications does he have that she doesn't?" asked Joseph Ochoa, a 
veteran Latino activist. "She's been there three or four years. She balanced 
the budget. You can see it's discrimination. What else is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Kelvin D. Filer vehemently denied that the board chose Handy because he 
is black: "Race had nothing to do with the selection, absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He said Handy impressed the board with his knowledge and understanding of the 
district, did his homework and is known as an administrator able to remedy 
troublesome situations. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the Latino community and the black-controlled school district 
and black-run city government have been escalating as the city's Latino 
population and school enrollment increase. 
</P>
<P>
In the district last year, 50.3% of the enrollment was Latino, and that 
percentage is expected to increase. Five years ago, Latino enrollment was 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Latino teachers and administrators represent less than 4% of the educational 
staff in the schools. And only about 9% of city government workers are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos have been demanding that both the city and the school district form 
affirmative action plans for hiring, and parents want the school district to 
hire more Spanish-speaking teachers. The parents complain that their children 
are being taught largely by Spanish-speaking classroom aides. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they are forced to rely heavily on aides because they 
cannot find enough bilingual teachers to serve the 8,000 children in the 
26,000-student district who need bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Some black trustees and educators are openly hostile to the idea of having to 
spend shrinking budget dollars on bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders also said they complained for years about conditions at 
Jefferson Elementary School, a dilapidated facility on the city's north side, 
one of the oldest Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
All but about 50 of the nearly 700 children at Jefferson are Latino. Most of 
the students attended class in old portable buildings that were so deteriorated 
that the school board this summer ordered them bulldozed. New portables are 
being moved onto the site in time for the first day of school, Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
After Handy's appointment was announced, Ochoa said that Latino parents should 
consider protesting by keeping their children out of school for three or four 
days. "It would bankrupt them," Ochoa said of the financially strapped 
district. 
</P>
<P>
State aid received by Compton and other districts is based average daily 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (district officials) could have gotten anybody more qualified 
than Mrs. Sanchez," said another activist, Gorgonio Sanchez, who is not related 
to Elisa Sanchez. "I think they're concerned more with political control of the 
district than with the quality of education." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Pallon, a local bakery owner active in the Latino Chamber of Commerce, 
said about Elisa Sanchez: "She balanced the budget. Here we're getting an 
outsider, someone who doesn't know the issues, (or how) the district is 
politically divided. She knows all this. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we get a good person in a position (to move up), right away for 
some reason or other they get either bypassed or demoted." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was named acting superintendent early this year when Ted D. Kimbrough 
left to head the Chicago school system. During the last seven months she 
steered the district through a difficult budget crunch that necessitated 
layoffs. She was on vacation this week and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez came to the district in 1983 as an associate superintendent and was 
later made deputy, largely overseeing all the instructional and curricula 
issues. She holds a master's degree in education from San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Handy holds a master's degree from San Jose State University and received his 
Ph.D. from the University of La Verne in 1987. He has been a school principal 
and was assistant superintendent in Sacramento for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The one Latino member of the school board, Manuel Correa, was not present for 
the vote on Handy. Pallon accused the board of scheduling the appointment while 
Correa was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Correa said last week that he had postponed his vacation one day to participate 
in interviews of the five finalists for the post. The interviews were held Aug. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Correa said he had ranked the candidates but refused to say how he ranked them 
or whether he would have voted for Sanchez or Handy. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last week to introduce Handy, board President Mary Henry 
read a statement quoting Correa as saying he fully supported the Handy 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent said last week that he hoped to bridge the gap between 
Latinos and blacks in the district. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Compton, with its overwhelmingly black and Latino population, 
has the potential to become a model for the state in terms of racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Handy also said last week that he would welcome a meeting with representatives 
of the Latino community: "I'm here. If they have a need to talk to me or 
discuss anything with me that is pertinent to the success of the Compton 
Unified School District, I'll be happy to meet with them."

DROPOUT PLAN GIVES STUDENTS RESPONSIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CLASS OF 1989 DROPPED OUT IN THE NORWALK-LA 
MIRADA DISTRICT. SO OFFICIALS ARE BORROWING AN APPROACH THAT HAS HAD REMARKABLE 
SUCCESS.

<P>
During the last six years, Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District officials 
have started one program after another aimed at staunching the flow of students 
who enter high schools then drop out before graduating. 
</P>
<P>
But each year the dropout rate has crept higher, peaking with the class of 
1989, when a little more than a third of the class dropped out during the three 
years before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a place in this district where we've got to do something," board 
President William White said. "We have some programs, but they just haven't 
been working out." 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that traditional stay-in-school programs, such as dropout counseling 
and independent study programs, are just not enough, the district board last 
week approved spending $1.3 million on a program that officials hope will lure 
students back to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is modeled after a highly successful program in the Sweetwater school 
district in southwestern San Diego County, which slashed the dropout rate from 
about 40% to 8% in five years, said Elias Galvan, the director of secondary 
education for the Norwalk-La Mirada district. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan, who visited the Sweetwater district four times during the summer to 
interview staff members, students and parents, said the plan calls for students 
to sign a contract agreeing they will attend one hour of computer courses and 
one hour of teacher-instructed courses a day. 
</P>
<P>
A counselor will also be hired to work with the students. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said after students spend two hours at school, they are free to go home. 
Sometime during the day, however, they must spend three to four more hours on 
home study. The students are expected to bring the work they completed at home 
to school the next day to discuss with the teacher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Students can attend their two hourlong courses any time from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., 
but they must clock in when they arrive, Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The program brings in high technology, counseling, teaching, the use of time 
-- all the things we have ever talked about," Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Galvan and some board members said, what makes the program most attractive 
to the students interviewed in San Diego is its flexibility, despite the use of 
a contract and time cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Galvan said, "the youngsters are not going to enroll in a 
program if they don't like it. But in this program they say, 'I only have to be 
in school only two hours a day. I am trusted to do my own work. I am 
responsible for my own progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to many kids, and I didn't find one that gave me negative feelings 
about the plan." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Bruce Butler, who visited Sweetwater last month, said: "Rather 
then forcing the student to fit into our schedule, we fit into their schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said he and district officials are so convinced that the program will 
work for them that they are willing to invest $200,000 on computer equipment 
and spend thousands more on staff, classroom preparation and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to lose some money at first," Butler said, but district officials 
are counting on the program to pay for itself eventually, because the state 
will reimburse the district about $3,000 per student who attends school daily. 
</P>
<P>
The program must enroll about 350 students to generate enough money to keep it 
running, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said district officials estimate that it could take up to two years to 
reach that figure. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said the district plans to begin recruiting dropout students immediately 
and will cull the lists of dropouts kept by the district, as well as spread the 
word on campus, churches and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
The two centers at La Mirada High School and Norwalk High School will probably 
be ready for the students by October, he said.

HELP FOR AILING PET OWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD: PETS ARE WONDERFUL SUPPORT, OR PAWS LA, IS A NONPROFIT GROUP 
THAT ASSISTS PEOPLE WITH AIDS IN TAKING CARE OF THEIR PETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jim Gorka, 34, never thought the day would come when Christopher, his aging 
German shepherd mix, and Charlie, his playful keeshond pup, would be too much 
for him to handle. 
</P>
<P>
But as he has watched his own strength dissipate due to complications of AIDS, 
he has had to come to grips with the painful reality that there are many things 
he can no longer do. And walking with his two furry friends is just one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It had become just another chore that I couldn't do, and right now, I need to 
simplify life," said Gorka, who these days finds the walk from his bedroom to 
the porch of his Hollywood apartment tiring. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorka and the two dogs are still together. 
</P>
<P>
Gorka got help from Pets Are Wonderful Support, or PAWS LA, a nonprofit group 
in West Hollywood that helps people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome to 
keep their pets while they struggle to deal with the illness playing havoc with 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
PAWS arranged for a volunteer to help walk Gorka's dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Often a pet is the only friend (a person with AIDS) has left," said Nadia 
Sutton, PAWS' director who co-founded the group less than two years ago. "There 
is a special bond of unconditional love that exists between a pet and its 
owner. The animal doesn't care how they look or how they feel, they don't care 
if they lost their job. The animal is always there giving unconditional love. 
It's a strong bond." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton is the only full-time employee at PAWS, coordinating the efforts of 
scores of volunteers to help about 25 people with AIDS and their pets each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to finding volunteers for dog walking, PAWS seeks helpers to make 
home visits to feed the cat and change the kitty litter. PAWS has made 
arrangements with several local veterinarians to provide free health care for 
its clients' pets. And even though PAWS is not an adoption service, it has 
helped find temporary and permanent shelter for numerous pets when their owners 
were no longer able to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to give people a choice so they don't have to get rid of their pets," 
she said. "And giving someone a choice is also letting them hold on to their 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
PAWS takes care of an array of pets from the ordinary to the exotic. Most are 
the usual dog and cat variety, but there have also been tropical fish, parrots, 
rabbits and even a python. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton also keeps records of each animal's peculiarities. "Booboo (a cat) does 
not like fish, and she likes to be stroked under the chin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such information has proven essential when the gray and black striped feline's 
owner, Rashied Franco, 32, has had to leave for long hospital stays to undergo 
treatment for leukemia. "If I didn't have PAWS, I would have had to give her 
away," Franco said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian Martin Schwartz was so impressed with the work of PAWS that he 
volunteers his services to its clients at minimal cost or free of charge. "It's 
extremely rewarding work," he said. "People with AIDS don't have the money to 
pay for their own medical bills, let alone their pets." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, PAWS operates on a tight budget -- about $25,000 annually -- 
based largely on donations from the public. The group this year requested more 
than $100,000 in funding from West Hollywood to expand and improve its efforts, 
but the request was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Curlee, an assistant administrator of the city's Human Services Department 
said PAWS did not have an established track record, and it did not meet the 
criteria set to be given priority for city funding. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, the staff all felt it was doing wonderful things," she 
said. "We didn't feel we could recommend it for funding but we all felt like 
volunteering to help. It is the kind of voluntary program where you can do as 
little or as much as you can and still feel like you are doing something 
meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
That is what attracted Jeanne Barney, a free-lance writer, to the program as a 
dog walker. "So many of my friends were dying from AIDS. I wanted to do 
something, but I didn't know what I could do," she said. "Then I heard about 
PAWS, and I said to myself, 'Now I can do that. I can walk someone's dog and 
make the quality of their life a little better. That's something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Every day about 4:30 p.m., when Barney comes up the walk to Gorka's apartment, 
Charlie and Christopher get excited. She usually brings them a snack. "Charlie 
pulls hard, he's like a little punk rocker," she said. "Chris just kind of 
lumbers along. If he were a musician, he would be a country musician." 
</P>
<P>
Gorka picked up Christopher nine years ago as protection in the tough gang 
section of Hollywood where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want just any dog, I wanted a good-size dog, not some little lap dog 
that would be yapping around me all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorka received Charlie less than a year ago from his companion, Rick Edenfield, 
to keep up his spirits. "Charlie keeps him on his toes," said Edenfield, who 
lives with Gorka. 
</P>
<P>
For many, what PAWS manages to do is give a little comfort to those in 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said she will never forget Richard, who called her office in desperation 
one night about a month ago from his hospital bed with an urgent request. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard was very worried about his cat, Joshua," she said. "He said, 'I'm in 
the hospital, and I don't know when I'll get out. My cat is in the apartment 
alone and has not eaten for three days. I need help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sutton picked up some cat food and kitty litter and rushed over to his 
apartment where she found Joshua -- in good health -- hiding under the bed. 
However, the apartment was in a shambles. So, after arranging for volunteers to 
make home visits to take care of the cat, she said she also arranged to have 
the apartment cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard was so happy when he came home about 10 days later," said Sutton, who 
kept in touch with him by phone. "He lived for another two weeks and then he 
died. When he died, they told me Joshua was lying on top of him -- they were 
together." 
</P>
<P>
After Richard's death, a new home was eventually found for Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really met, but in that brief time we touched each other and became 
totally close," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
PAWS L.A. was modeled after similar programs in New York City and San 
Francisco. For information, to make donations or to volunteer, call 213 
650-7297.

NEW KID ON THE BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THE THIRD STREET PROMENADE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO THE NEW HOT 
SPOT IN TOWN. IT'S WESTWOOD VILLAGE WITHOUT THE TRAFFIC, LACK OF PARKING AND 
RAMBUNCTIOUS TEEN-AGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nearly a year after its official opening, the Third Street Promenade in Santa 
Monica -- once an aging eyesore of a bygone era -- is becoming a bustling 
pedestrian-oriented entertainment center of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can park in one of six garages with 3,000 spaces, walk along a 
three-block area to see a movie at one of more than 20 screens, eat at a fancy 
dinner or snack at a burger joint, then browse through several bookstores. At 
the end of the night -- as late as 3 a.m. on weekends -- people are heading to 
a coffeehouse for an espresso. 
</P>
<P>
"It has exceeded our wildest dreams in terms of generating a new social center 
for the city," said Mayor Pro Tem David Finkel, who has observed the changes 
from his 4th Street law office. "It's just amazing to see and feel the 
electricity of the people." 
</P>
<P>
The successful transformation of what was a nearly-dead outdoor shopping mall 
along 3rd Street between Broadway and Wilshire Boulevard has occurred so 
quickly that a new road built through the promenade to accommodate one lane of 
traffic in each direction has been closed on Friday and Saturday nights to 
allow people to walk freely. 
</P>
<P>
The promenade, with its movie theaters, restaurants, bars and shops, is being 
compared to what Westwood Village used to be like before becoming congested 
with traffic, plagued by a shortage of parking and overrun by rambunctious 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else can you go in West Los Angeles and walk around outside of 
Westwood," said Barbara Tenzer, a commercial real estate broker for Sommer 
Broida Commercial Brokerage Co. "But even Westwood is a younger crowd. This is 
a real good mix of older people, young people and families." 
</P>
<P>
Herman and Millie Rosenstein, both 75 and Santa Monica residents for 10 years, 
take daily walks through the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
Although both are concerned that it will become "yuppieville," they said they 
enjoy being able to walk at a slow pace and view the activity around the 
promenade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been some time since anyone said the Third Street Mall, as it was once 
called, is fun. 
</P>
<P>
The mall opened in the mid-1960s, when outdoor malls were the rage. It enjoyed 
modest success, despite a shortage of parking. The city tried to resolve the 
parking problem by building parking garages along 2nd and 4th streets, but in 
the process dislocated many businesses on those streets. 
</P>
<P>
The final blow to the mall came in the early 1980s, when Santa Monica Place, an 
enclosed shopping center with two anchor department stores, opened across the 
street from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
After that, some merchants half-heartedly joked that the Third Street Mall 
attracted more transients than customers. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to revive the mall began in 1983, with construction beginning in May, 
1988. Construction focused on public improvements along the street, since the 
buildings are all privately owned. The city issued $13 million in bonds, with 
$3 million to pay existing debt, $4 million for new parking spaces and $6 
million for street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners are paying off the bond over 30 years through an assessment 
district. For their money, property owners have 3,000 parking spaces in six 
garages along 2nd and 4th streets. Along 3rd Street, the city has planted palm 
and jacaranda trees, improved lighting, placed wrought-iron benches and trash 
receptacles and built small plazas with fountains and topiary dinosaurs in the 
middle of the street at each end of the three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., the 
nonprofit group that manages the promenade, said he is pleased with the early 
success of the promenade and already is looking to add another 300 parking 
spaces by building more levels on existing parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what we wanted," Carroll said. "We want to be a great walking 
street." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said there are no statistics available on the number of people who 
visit the promenade, but he said that on weekends the four garages between 
Broadway and Arizona Avenue are filled to near-capacity, and the two garages 
between Arizona and Wilshire are about 70% full. 
</P>
<P>
With the increase in visitors to the promenade, the number of transients who 
roamed the mall before the renovations were completed apparently has dwindled. 
Police officials say the visibility of beat cops who ride bicycles up and down 
the promenade and patrol the six garages also helps keep transients away. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll and merchants on the promenade point to the opening of three movie 
theaters as the catalyst for the early success. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon was the first to open last October with a four-screen complex 
just north of Broadway. AMC Theatres followed in March with a seven-screen 
complex -- which includes an indoor-outdoor cafe -- on the promenade at Santa 
Monica Boulevard. Mann Theatres soon opened a six-screen theater across the 
promenade from AMC. A block away on 2nd Street, Laemmle Theatres operates a 
four-screen theater, which has been at that location for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Rutkowski, an AMC vice president, said that more than 250,000 people have 
visited his Santa Monica 7 Theatres since it opened in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The promenade has all the right chemistry," Rutkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of people attending movies has meant an increase in business 
for many merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"The movies have played a major role in the success of the promenade," said 
Jivan Tabibian, managing owner of Remi, an Italian restaurant next to the 
Cineplex Odeon. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey D. Gottlieb, general manager of the Broadway Bar &amp; Grill, said he 
has added a late-night supper to his menu, and keeps his kitchen open until 
midnight on weekends to accommodate customers who want a bite to eat after 
they've been to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hendrickson, assistant manager of the Midnight Special Bookstore, which 
has been on 3rd Street for eight years, also said he has seen an increase in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to close at 6:30 p.m., but now we stay open as late as 11 p.m.," 
Hendrickson said. "There is a lot of late-night traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Teasers, in business for five years at its location just north of Santa Monica 
Boulevard, was a popular restaurant and bar even before the renovations. But 
owner Dan Ringwood said business has increased by at least 25% in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
New businesses are waiting to open with anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is incredibly exciting," said Irene Astrow, one of the owners of Yankee 
Doodles, a two-level, 28-table upscale billiard parlor scheduled to open on the 
promenade in mid-November. "We are there constantly. You can see the increase 
in the number of people each time." 
</P>
<P>
Another business hoping to take advantage of the mix of business on the 
promenade is the Los Angeles International Culinary Institute, which is 
scheduled to open early next year as a training center, as well as a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"The location offers everything we are looking for," said Raimund Hofmeister, 
president of the institute and executive chef at the Century Plaza Hotel. "We 
can help supply the abundance of restaurants in the area with apprentices, and 
from a student's point of view, there are plenty of activities. This will add 
to the school as a sales point." 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants have become regular customers of businesses on the promenade. 
Budd Friedman, who owns The Improv comedy club on Santa Monica Boulevard 
between 3rd and 4th streets, said he and his wife had been going to movie 
theaters in Century City, but now go to the theaters on the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how quickly it has developed," Friedman said. "I can't believe 
the difference in the neighborhood in a little over two years. This has become 
a destination area." 
</P>
<P>
Bayside District Corp. is trying to help that phenomenon along with various 
promotions, such as a free folk and jazz festival being held today from noon to 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Having succeeded with restaurants and movie theaters, Bayside District Corp. 
director Carroll said the next challenge is to bring new retail shops to the 
promenade and attract businesses to the block between Arizona Avenue and 
Wilshire Boulevard, which has developed slower than the other two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get the people down here we should be able to attract the retail," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The promenade still has boarded-up shops, and demolition continues at some 
sites. Many of the older shops, such as The Supply Sergeant and Europa 
department store, are gone and will likely be replaced with upscale shops. But 
others, like J.C. Penney and Woolworth, will remain. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Tenzer said that with the crowds that the promenade is 
attracting, it has been easier to persuade new retailers to locate there. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said they are going after retail businesses not already located at 
Santa Monica Place, which they consider a complement to the promenade rather 
than a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
But while many visitors to the promenade approve of the changes taking place on 
3rd Street, some have mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Fisher, 48, of Santa Monica was recently sitting in the outdoor patio of 
Congo Square, an espresso and tea house on the promenade between Wilshire and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoyed being able to sit outdoors in the promenade without having 
to watch cars go by, but part of him yearns for the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked Santa Monica when it was a small run-down community," Fisher said. 
"Now, ultra-chic is overrunning the place."

<P>
At an age when most people have long since retired, 89-year-old Elizabeth 
Leighton believes in keeping busy. 
</P>
<P>
Leighton works six days a week, sometimes putting in 10 or more hours a day, 
tutoring students in her Whittier home. She teaches reading, writing and math, 
and gives organ and piano lessons to about 60 students. 
</P>
<P>

Leighton came to California in 1920 after graduating from Buena Vista College 
in Storm Lake, Iowa, with a bachelor's degree in music. She has a degree in 
English from Northwestern University and a doctorate in music and reading from 
International Graduate School in St. Louis, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Even injuries have not stopped her. In 1986, after falling down the stairs in 
her home and breaking her hip, she continued to teach. "I had the students come 
to my bedside," said Leighton, whose husband, Roy, died in 1975. At the reading 
conference in Stockholm, Leighton used a wheelchair because the hip had not 
completely mended. 
</P>
<P>
Leighton's teaching career has spanned nearly 70 years. She has taught in both 
public and private schools, and began private tutoring about 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A former student, Edward Barajas, now 35, remembered being tutored in reading 
by Leighton when he was a fifth-grade pupil at Longfellow elementary in the 
Whittier City School District. "She taught me to love reading," said Barajas 
who is now sending his son, Gilbert, 9, to Leighton for reading instruction.

Two Cerritos College student athletes, Erik S. Bonnar and Tiffany South, have 
been honored for their academic and athletic achievements. Bonnar was selected 
as the Wilson Sporting Goods California Community College 1990 scholar-athlete 
of year. Bonnar, who had a perfect 4.0 grade-point average, was captain of the 
swimming team and selected as the most improved water polo player. 
</P>
<P>
South, who also had a 4.0 grade-point average, was chosen as the woman 
scholar-athlete of the year by the college's athletic league, the South Coast 
Conference. South also was one of 14 finalists for the state scholar-athlete 
award. She was an outstanding cross country and track and field athlete.

Jordan High School graduate Eugene McCown was one of 225 honor graduates from 
across the country to visit the nation's Capitol recently as part of the 
National Young Leaders Conference Postgraduate Program. The young scholars met 
with members of Congress and other government officials. 
</P>
<P>
McCown, 17, maintained a 3.4 grade-point average at the Long Beach school. He 
will attend San Diego State, where he will major in electronic engineering. 
McCown also plans to try out for the football team. In high school, he was an 
outstanding player and was secretary of athletics on the student council.

<P>
The Bixby Knolls Parking and Business Improvement Area Advisory Board has given 
a $250 award to Pam Kissick for designing a new logo for the uptown Long Beach 
business district. Kissick's entry was selected from among 30 others, said Kimi 
Mann, executive director of the business association. 
</P>
<P>
The turquoise-colored logo shows a sun rising from behind a mountain, which 
represents a re-emergence of the area, Mann said. Kissick said the intent of 
her design is "to incorporate a new and up-to-date look, but capture the 
friendly down-home feeling of Bixby Knolls." Kissick and her husband, Michael, 
are owners of MJK Construction Inc., which is located in the Bixby Knolls area.

CLARIFYING ROLE IN CHANNEL GATEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent letter (Times, Aug. 12) by the erstwhile president of the Venice 
Town Council contained a number of factual errors and erroneous assertions, 
which need to be corrected for your readers. 
</P>
<P>
It is stated that I "(made) sure" that the Coastal Commission held its hearing 
on Channel Gateway in Eureka instead of waiting a month for a meeting in the 
Marina. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission makes its own decisions about scheduling and, as it 
happens, obeys the state Coastal Act in doing so. That law says that the 
Coastal Commission is obliged to hear every appeal within 49 days of its being 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
A Venice resident filed an appeal on Gateway on July 13. According to the 
commission staff report, the last day to hold a hearing is Aug. 31, several 
days prior to the Marina del Rey meeting in September. Without permission of 
the project applicant, the hearing can't be postponed. The applicant would not 
grant a postponement, so by law it has to take place in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the assertion that I have "sold out every principle (I) ever claimed 
to believe in" in order to provide affordable housing, my entire career as a 
community activist is marked by strenuous efforts to work within the system to 
provide new affordable housing in the Coastal Zone. There are dozens of 
affordable units on the ground to prove it, and hundreds more in the pipeline 
as a result of my continued efforts since being elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
As for what's happening to the community as a whole, the record clearly shows 
that commercial development applications in Venice are down by about 50% and 
approvals down even more than that, compared to what was going on before I took 
office in 1987. Claims to the contrary are merely politically motivated 
rhetoric from people unwilling to make the tough choices required to create 
affordable housing on expensive land in tight financial times. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, regarding reelection campaign offers, I continue to adhere to my 
long-standing policy of neither soliciting nor accepting campaign contributions 
from developers with controversial projects pending in my district. If one 
comes in unsolicited, I return it. This policy will keep my campaign fund 
anything but full. By the way, my campaign finance reports are on file with the 
City Clerk and available for public review.

U.S. REJECTS REQUEST FOR SHELTER GRANT; 
</P>
<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD: THE $3 MILLION WOULD HAVE HELPED PAY FOR COUNSELING PROGRAMS AT 
THE 70-BED FACILITY, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN NOVEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The West Hollywood Homeless Organization was dealt a financial blow last week 
when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development turned down its 
request for a $3-million grant to help pay for counseling programs at a 70-bed 
shelter that the group is scheduled to open in November. 
</P>
<P>
News of the rejection began circulating after the controversial West Hollywood 
shelter's name did not appear on a list of about 143 projects announced by HUD 
on Tuesday. The projects will share $119.5 million intended to help homeless 
people make the transition from the streets to independent living. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Long, West Hollywood's director of Human Services, was reluctant to 
comment on the decision until he received official word of HUD's decision. But 
he did say the Homeless Organization would probably appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Erlenbusch, the shelter's executive director, said there were some 
encouraging signs within the discouraging news. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that we were the first alternate on the list," he said. "That is 
excellent for a program that hasn't opened yet and is without a track record." 
</P>
<P>
On West Hollywood's east end, where neighborhood groups have been fighting the 
proposed shelter, word of HUD's decision was well-received. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they didn't get it," said Ed Riney, a spokesman for Eastend Community 
Action. "Maybe this will force them to forget the idea of a vagrant shelter and 
focus on a program that will help people with AIDS and the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
The West Hollywood Homeless Organization had planned to use HUD grant money -- 
which was to be paid out over five years at $600,000 a year -- to provide for a 
full-time job counselor, substance-abuse counselor and housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"What it means now is that we will have to phase in different aspects of the 
program as we identify additional funding," Erlenbusch said. "And in the 
meantime, we will spread some of the work around to different people." 
</P>
<P>
The city established the nonprofit homeless organization last year for the 
purpose of opening a shelter, and also provided nearly $1 million to renovate a 
building on La Brea Avenue that is to be used for the facility. City officials 
have provided $574,000 for the first year of operation, and they expect the 
city's annual obligation to the program to level off at about $300,000.

CITY MANAGER WARNED TO SHAPE UP; 
</P>
<P>
CERRITOS: SOURCES SAY THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TOLD GAYLORD F. KNAPP THAT HE FACES 
DISMISSAL WITHIN SIX MONTHS IF HIS PERFORMANCE DOES NOT IMPROVE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three of the five City Council members have told veteran City Manager Gaylord 
F. Knapp that he faces dismissal within six months if he does not improve his 
performance, said sources close to Knapp and the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority reportedly delivered the ultimatum to Knapp during a 
closed Aug. 16 session, during which he reportedly received his annual 
performance review. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp -- who in his 17 years as manager guided the transformation of this 
former dairy town into a tax-rich suburban oasis -- refused to comment. City 
Council members either could not be reached for comment or refused to answer 
questions about the session. 
</P>
<P>
But during a public session that night, the council unanimously approved two 
key changes in Knapp's contract. The council raised Knapp's severance pay from 
six to nine months and allowed him to explore other job possibilities. Until 
then, Knapp was prohibited from looking for other jobs. Knapp reportedly asked 
for both amendments. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager of a neighboring city said word spread quickly the next day 
that Knapp, who has close friends in the city manager network, has apparently 
lost the support of a majority of council members. The source spoke on the 
condition that he remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been getting tons of phone calls," he said. "It's no secret." 
</P>
<P>
According to a City Hall source, two council members wanted to dismiss Knapp 
the night of the meeting, but failed to obtain a third vote. 
</P>
<P>
The members told Knapp they were concerned about a heavy-handed management 
style and his inaccessibility, the source said. They reportedly told Knapp that 
he had to communicate more openly with them, go into the community and mix more 
with residents, developers and business owners and be more responsive to the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his career, Knapp refused to allow department heads and other 
employees to talk to reporters, but the council a few years ago approved a 
resolution overturning that policy. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, 47, earns about $101,000 a year. He became city manager at age 30, a 
year after he went to work for the city as environmental affairs director. 
Before coming to Cerritos, Knapp was assistant planning director for La Mesa in 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
He is generally credited with running a tightly controlled city government 
known for efficiency and for clever use of state redevelopment laws that have 
allowed the city to lure commercial developers. The city this year has a 
$20-million reserve in its treasury. 
</P>
<P>
But the composition of the City Council changed in the spring, when incumbents 
Diana Needham and Barry Rabbitt were unable to run for reelection. The City 
Charter prohibits incumbents from serving more than two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a very, very different council," the city manager source said. 
</P>
<P>
Needham declined to comment on the Knapp situation. Rabbitt is out of the 
country on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Mayor Ann Joynt and Councilman Sherman Kappe favored immediate 
dismissal, while Councilman Daniel Wong remained a strong supporter of Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
Joynt and Wong could not be reached for comment. Kappe, who was elected to the 
council this year, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Bowlen also declined to discuss Knapp's status but said he was 
concerned about how the council handled the issues the night of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Crawley, who was also elected this spring, said: "I don't think 
I have been on the council long enough to take any drastic action against the 
city manager."

MONTEREY PARK WEIGHS PLAN TO ALLOW POTBELLIED PIG PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider a proposal Monday to allow city residents to 
keep Vietnamese potbellied pigs as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Most urban municipalities explicitly bar pigs, while many rural communities 
strictly regulate how swine may be kept, because of concerns over odor and, 
years ago, over disease. 
</P>
<P>
But Monterey Park police Capt. Jim Strait is convinced that miniature pigs 
deserve special treatment, according to a report he wrote for the City Council 
after he and officers from his animal control unit researched the subject. 
</P>
<P>
They received advice from Los Angeles animal control officials, as well as the 
San Gabriel Valley Humane Society. "We're told these are excellent pets," he 
said. "They aren't dirty, and they don't create a nuisance, and it would not 
create adverse conditions if we allowed them as legal pets." 
</P>
<P>
The adult pigs, which can cost thousands of dollars apiece, can weigh from 30 
to almost 200 pounds and live about 15 years. Just one pig would be allowed per 
household. 
</P>
<P>
The city does not permit sheep, goats or horses, nor even miniature horses, 
Strait said. Ironically, La Habra Heights permits all those other animals but 
makes no allowances for the miniature pigs. 
</P>
<P>
One La Habra Heights family recently said it has decided to move rather than 
surrender its potbellied pigs. The 17,000-square-foot lot of Gerald and 
Kathleen Hartinger is too small to house a pig, according to that city's laws. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Heights officials ordered the pigs removed after a neighbor complained 
that the pigs smelled, which the Hartingers denied. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Strait does not foresee an odor problem in Monterey Park. "If the owners 
take care of them, they're clean and well kept," he said. "In that respect, 
they are very much like dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city law forbids any pig in a residence and only permits swine in 
areas zoned for agriculture. "Pigs are intelligent, and they are clean," said 
Dyer Huston, a spokesman for the city Department of Animal Regulation. "But a 
pig is a pig." HOWARD BLUME

HUNTINGTON PARK COUNCILMAN SPENT 70% MORE THAN OTHERS IN LAST ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Hernandez spent 70% more than any other candidate in last April's City 
Council election as he and Raul Perez became the first Latinos to be elected to 
office in this overwhelmingly Latino city. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign disclosure statements show that Hernandez spent $29,219, which he used 
to plaster the city with signs and send out various mailers, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who was fined more than $2,000 for turning in his disclosure 
statements late, received most of his contributions from businessmen, 
professionals and companies in Huntington Park and surrounding cities, the 
statements indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez finished third in the balloting for three council seats, edging out 
former Councilman Jim Roberts by 27 votes. Perez received the most votes, 
followed by veteran Councilman William P. Cunningham.

<P>
Cathy Brock had only been to see her father once at Orange County Jail in all 
the months he was there. It had been too hard on both of them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she had written to him. She had told him how sorry she was that "you had to 
give up your life to see me happy." The letter upset him. He told the family: 
Tell Cathy she is not to blame. She is not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
James Joseph Rovida Jr., a 55-year-old Los Alamitos truck driver whose life 
revolved around his wife, his five grown children and his grandchildren, was 
convicted last month of first-degree murder in the death of Cathy Brock's 
husband, Robert Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Brock was shot to death just after 3 a.m. on July 6, 1989, in the front 
driveway of his sister's home in Orange, where he was living during the 
couple's latest fight. Brock had just gotten off work at a printing plant in 
Fullerton, where prosecutors say Rovida had followed him -- then fatally shot 
him in the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Brock's death put an end to the stormiest marriage those closest to the Brock 
couple had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from downhill to the bottom," Cathy Brock, 31, said in describing 
their final days together. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rovida was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison by Superior Court 
Judge Robert C. Todd. He will be almost 70 before he is even eligible to apply 
for parole. 
</P>
<P>
Her father did not do it, Cathy Brock insisted. But she blames herself anyway. 
There had been that dramatic confrontation on the Riverside Freeway, her 
husband tracking her down and shouting threats, furious that she was taking 
their two children on a Rovida family trip against his orders. 
</P>
<P>
Her father had shot out Brock's car windows. If that hadn't happened, Cathy 
Brock insisted, police would never have tried to pin her husband's murder on 
her father. And she was to blame for what happened on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
She was to blame for her father, an innocent man, being in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Except her father is not innocent. After his trial, he finally confessed. He 
had kept it from his family, even from his own lawyer. The confession was 
played out by the prosecution in open court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway incident, Rovida told a probation officer, had led him to confront 
Brock, to let him know that Rovida just couldn't take it anymore. Rovida denies 
he meant to kill him. But he admits it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Cathy just cannot accept losing both her husband and her father, so she blocks 
it out, just refuses to believe it," said her sister-in-law, Joann Shaw, Robert 
Brock's sister, who had found him dead in her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
At her new home in Bellflower, where she's raising their daughters, ages 9 and 
5, Cathy Brock looked at a picture of Robert and her on their wedding day. They 
looked happy. 
</P>
<P>
"But there weren't a whole lot of good times," she said. "I always had to get 
my butt kicked -- even when he was just mad at himself over something, I was in 
for a beating." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brock had been her only real boyfriend. They began dating when she was 
16 and moved in together when she was 18. They married four years later. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Robert Brock's sisters interviewed defend their brother, in part. Cathy 
was often the aggressor in the arguments, they said. Joann Shaw says her 
brother still had a bruise on his cheek at his funeral caused by an assault 
from Cathy Brock. But even they don't deny their brother could be violent. 
</P>
<P>
"We begged them to break up," Joann Shaw said. "We said, 'Look what you are 
doing to each other. Look what you are doing to your kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
They lived in Buena Park, Cypress, Fullerton, anywhere they could stay a jump 
ahead of rent payments due. Robert Brock was an electrician, but had been laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Brock describes a life of hell. Twice a month or more he would beat her 
with his fists, she said. Once he used shearing scissors to tear up all her 
clothes, she said. Another time, she claimed, he even put razor blades in her 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
She has a scar on her arm from the shearing scissors, when she tried to stop 
him. And another from an ashtray fight. She told about one incident in which he 
stole her driver's license and car registration, took her plates off the car, 
then reported the car stolen. She spent a night in jail before the mess was 
straightened out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Three times she went to court to get restraining orders against him during 
their many break-ups. The problem was, restraining orders don't amount to 
anything when the man is determined to ignore them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, Brock's sisters say, Cathy Brock never gave the restraining 
orders a chance. Because she always went back to him. Always. 
</P>
<P>
Even that last dramatic week, when they were down to nothing and nowhere to 
live, she had planned to go back to him. She said so in court. 
</P>
<P>
Their problems came to a head in November, 1988, when she lost her job. She 
claims her husband could not accept her working while he was unemployed and got 
her fired by constantly harassing her at work. They skipped town owing back 
rent at their apartment in Fullerton in May, 1989. He had picked up a 
minimum-wage job, enough for them to survive, living in a run-down motel in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't know how that feels," she said. "Two kids and not even a home for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth of July week, 1989, the Rovidas had asked her and the children to join 
them for a family trip to the Colorado River. She claims Robert did not want 
her to go. She went anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids needed some fun in their lives," she explained. "But Robert warned me: 
'You won't make it to the river.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two carloads of Rovidas were heading north on the Riverside Freeway when Robert 
pulled alongside them in his own car, shouting threats, they all say. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that if we went ahead to the river, he'd burn my parents' house down," 
Cathy Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, family members told police, Brock pulled his car in front of Rovida's. 
The Brock family disputes that he tried to run anyone off the road. But the 
Rovidas say clearly he was harassing them. That's when Rovida shot out Brock's 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
Paul S. Meyer, Rovida's lawyer, says the real tragedy of the case is that 
Rovida is probably not guilty of the crime he was convicted of: first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd had the facts, we probably could have shown the jury this was a 
voluntary manslaughter," Meyer said. "But Mr. Rovida was too ashamed to admit 
to his family what he had done. So he kept it from everyone, including me. What 
a terrible, terrible consequence he must pay now." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Brock remains torn about what happened. She did love her husband, she 
says. And she is definite that she did not want him dead, especially because he 
was close to their younger daughter. 
</P>
<P>
But still, she feels free. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm actually a person; I have self-respect, I have things, and a home for 
my daughters," she said. "I'm no longer just someone who needs her butt 
kicked." 
</P>
<P>
And she has also made a commitment to Brock's family. Despite the wishes of 
some of her siblings, she is letting her daughters spend time with Brock's 
sisters, whom they adore. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids don't deserve any more punishment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Creighton, another of Brock's sisters, said they appreciate Cathy "not 
using the children as weapons between the families." 
</P>
<P>
"My brother's kids are like my own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton added that the Brock family is angry that Rovida, in none of his 
court appearances, ever showed remorse for Robert Brock's death. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do feel sorry for Cathy," she said. "If only she and Robert could have 
stayed away from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Brock's task now is to confront the truth about her father. 
</P>
<P>
She still won't admit his guilt. And her mother has persuaded her it's best if 
she does not return to Orange County Jail to see him before he is shipped to 
prison this week. But she says she does have something she wants him to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
She explained: "I have to let him know, that I know I'm the one to blame."

FRIZZELLE GETS IT AT HOME FOR VOTES AGAINST OIL SPILL BILL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ASSEMBLYMAN DEFENDS POSITION AMID HEAVY FIRE FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH 
OFFICIALS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS. HE INSISTS LAW JUST WOULDN'T BE WORKABLE.

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At odds with the sentiments of hometown officials, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle 
(R-Huntington Beach) has opposed major environmental legislation requiring oil 
companies to help pay for better response to disastrous tanker spills like the 
one that fouled beaches in his own district in February. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Assembly's Natural Resources Committee, Frizzelle last week 
voted against a bill by state Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) that would make oil 
companies ante up $150 million to pay for improved cleanup efforts after a 
spill. Frizzelle was on the losing side of an 8-3 committee vote in favor of 
the measure, which gained urgency this year after the Huntington Beach spill. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials, who say they support the Keene bill, were unaware 
of Frizzelle's vote and intend to ask him to reconsider. And Orange County 
environmentalists, some of whom worked to save imperiled birds after the 
Huntington Beach disaster, expressed shock that Frizzelle would oppose stronger 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
"It strikes me as unbelievable that someone representing this district would 
not recognize the need to protect us from oil spills, which would likely happen 
here some day," said Victor Leipzig, a college biology instructor and executive 
director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy. "It obviously doesn't make any sense 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle defended his vote, saying he supports tougher oil spill legislation 
but voted against Keene's measure because of how it would assess fees against 
petroleum producers and leave cleanup crews open to potential lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to vote for anything that's not workable, no matter what 
Huntington Beach thinks, no matter what the environmentalists think and no 
matter what the oil companies think," Frizzelle said. "This bill is not 
workable for them but they just don't know it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reports show that Frizzelle has accepted $3,950 in campaign 
contributions from oil producers in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
According to LegiTech, a computer tracking firm in Sacramento, those 
contributing included large oil producers with plenty at stake in the current 
oil spill legislation: Texaco ($500); Shell Oil Co. ($1,000); Chevron Corp. 
($500); Atlantic Richfield ($900); and the Independent Oil Producers Political 
Fund ($500). 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle's objections are similar to those of Gov. George Deukmejian, who has 
written to Keene and threatened to veto what environmentalists are calling 
landmark legislation. Deukmejian wants the oil spill fund scaled down to $30 
million and is also troubled by the liability issue. 
</P>
<P>
After months of hardball negotiations among environmentalists, oil companies 
and legislators, the Keene bill has become one of the primary vehicles in the 
Legislature for bolstering the state's oil spill plan. The bill gained 
immediate momentum after the ill-fated tanker American Trader settled on its 
own anchor and spilled 399,000 gallons of crude off the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Keene's complex measure establishes the office of an oil spill "czar," 
responsible for directing on-site spill response by state, industry, private 
and volunteer cleanup crews. The czar would have power to assess fines against 
any oil producer that fails to have in writing a comprehensive emergency spill 
plan. The cost of recovery and cleanup after a spill would be billed to the 
responsible oil company, such as British Petroleum in the Huntington Beach 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill requires oil companies to pay a 25-cent tax for each 
barrel of oil they import to or produce in California. The money would stock a 
$150-million trust fund that would help underwrite quick response and pay for 
wildlife rehabilitation. The tax could be raised to $1 a barrel for any 
extraordinary expenses that require the temporary loan of state money. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more controversial amendments, however, has to do with who would be 
subject to a lawsuit if cleanup efforts were found to damage private property. 
Originally, Keene made the oil company that spilled the crude liable for those 
kinds of cleanup mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
But the amendment would protect the on-site workers for only 60 days -- a 
crucial change that would leave professional cleanup crews open to lawsuits 
while working on spills that take longer than two months to mop up. The 
amendment exempts volunteers, but holds industry-backed response teams liable 
for damages they may cause while working "orphan" spills, or those mishaps 
committed by small petroleum companies with limited financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and other critics of the amendment say it is at cross purposes with 
the whole idea of ensuring a quick response, since worries of lawsuits will 
force cleanup crews to think twice before coming to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody who would dare to move, without first checking with their 
attorney, without first checking the degree of liability," he said. The 
additional legal costs, he added, would be picked up by oil companies and 
passed onto the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe whenever we put chains on people who clean it (a spill) up, they 
simply are not going to do it or they are going to charge so much for the price 
of their services, the price of gasoline is going to bear a brunt of having to 
pay for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from liability, Frizzelle said, he objects to how the Keene measure would 
raise the money for the $150-million spill trust fund. Instead of taking the 
money from oil companies up front, he wants the fees tacked on further along in 
the production process when the oil is sold out of refineries to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
The idea would not only relieve oil companies of paying the tax directly, 
Frizzelle said, it would also save consumers money at the pumps. There is great 
temptation for producers and refiners to take an extra cut of the new tax as it 
is passed along the line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time it changes hands, there is an uppage, over and above the cost of 
the fees, so by the time it translates to the consumer, you almost double the 
cap for the fees," Frizzelle said. 
</P>
<P>
During committee deliberations on Wednesday, Frizzelle also voted against 
language in the Keene bill calling for the state to give first consideration to 
protecting the coast during spill preparation and response. Frizzelle wanted 
those environmental considerations balanced against how much the efforts would 
cost oil companies for new technology. 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle said he fought the stronger environmental language because it was 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentalists love this kind of thing because they can change this in 
midstream," he said. "A major corporation has to have something predictable. 
They have to have something that is definable, that they know they have to 
measure up to. They're willing to do it, they're happy to do it and they want 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Those kind of ambiguities and questions over liability, Frizzelle says, has 
created a "bureaucratic monster" and a "boondoggle" that will cost consumers 
disproportionately at the gas pump for the protection it will provide. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Frizzelle's votes last week, Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays 
said he, most council members and other city officials have been working for 
passage of tougher oil spill legislation. They've sent the fire chief to 
Washington and talked to some Sacramento legislators, but not Frizzelle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we just need to do a little more intense lobbying of local 
legislators," said Mays, himself a candidate for Assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the legislators hear from their constituents, they don't know," said 
Mays, who added that he will call Frizzelle to discuss the votes. "They go on 
their gut feel. It's as much our responsibilities as a community to let our 
legislators know how we feel on certain issues." 
</P>
<P>
Leipzig, who teaches biology at Cypress College, said supporting strong oil 
spill legislation would reap economic benefits for coastal cities such as 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be an environmentalist to recognize that an oil spill is 
damaging to our community," he said. "We suffered environmental damage, but we 
suffered just as much economic damage. Our community is, in part, strongly 
dependent on our tourist industry, which was completely shut down in the month 
of February, not to mention the costs incurred by the city." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Faber, past president of the environmental group Amigos de Bolsa 
Chica, said Frizzelle "should have to explain himself to the electorate" for 
last week's votes. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be another case of the Orange County cavemen," Faber said, 
referring to the term Democratic legislators in Sacramento use to describe 
their conservative colleagues from Orange County. "I guess maybe a soft way of 
putting it is misrepresenting their constituents' interests. He's failed in his 
responsibility to those who care about our coastline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE OIL SPILL FALLOUT 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 1/2 months after the county's shoreline was blackened with crude oil, 
few effects are evident. Biologists are still studying marine life, lawyers are 
still collecting evidence -- and more tankers than ever are using the 
Huntington Beach terminal, although they are observing new precautions and 
carrying smaller loads. 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL: Orange County's wetlands were spared, but tiny marine creatures 
that lived in the Huntington Beach sand were killed, as were thousands of 
grunion and millions of their eggs and also at least 700 birds. State 
biologists say the grunion already are spawning safely again and that the 
shrimp, clam and other tiny sand-dwelling species will be at their normal 
populations within five years. The long-term effects on birds have not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMIC: The city of Huntington Beach says it spent about $528,000 on the 
cleanup, including overtime for police and firefighters and use of sand graders 
and other equipment and materials. The city has received a partial payment of 
$250,000 from American Trading Transportation, owner of the tanker that spilled 
the oil, and the city plans to seek more money in a lawsuit filed by the state. 
City officials said tourism this summer has not suffered, although they worry 
the city's image has been permanently tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
PROSECUTION: The state attorney general's office is still gathering evidence in 
preparation for prosecuting one or all of the parties involved: British 
Petroleum, American Trading Transportation and Golden West Refining. The 
attorneys plan to seek at least $8 million in connection with violations of 
state water-pollution laws, and they also hope to collect an unidentified extra 
amount in damages and for reimbursement of costs to the city, county and state. 
The prosecutor has refused comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL: Most political observers believe that the spill galvanized once 
laid-back Huntington Beach into becoming militant about protecting its 
environment. Residents have vehemently opposed malathion spraying, and an 
initiative to restrict sales and leases of beach and parkland qualified for the 
ballot. Slow-growth forces in the city hope to tap that environmental sentiment 
into City Council victories in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
TANKER TRAFFIC: About 12 tankers have used the mooring since the spill. Ships 
have been restricted to smaller drafts because they must maintain a 6-foot 
cushion between anchor and ocean floor. That means the largest tanker has a 
draft of about 37 feet, depending on the sea conditions; the American Trader, 
by contrast, had a 43-foot draft when it ran aground. Because each ship must 
carry less cargo, more tankers than in the past are using the terminal -- about 
three a month, contrasted with about two before.

Corona del Mar resident Don Hodes has always looked for new challenges. When 
kayaking, swimming and marathons grew stale for the 35-year-old attorney, he 
looked for something different. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he started walking on water. 
</P>
<P>
Using two pontoon-like shoes and a long, double-sided oar, Hodes skates across 
the Pacific waves near his Crystal Cove condominium with balance and poise of 
biblical proportions. Since he picked up the sport -- developed in Europe as an 
off-season training tool for skiers -- Hodes has taken on long-distance 
crossings of some of the world's major waterways, including the Strait of 
Gibraltar, the Irish Sea and the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
So where does the next challenge lie? Perhaps in crossing diplomatic channels. 
</P>
<P>
For his next act, Hodes is negotiating with Soviet and American officials for 
passage through the Bering Strait in September. Call it glasnost on water, or 
pontoon peristroika -- he's off to Alaska in less than a month, and hoping to 
return with a few more water miles under his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge with this one has been coordinating everything 
politically," Hodes said in an interview Saturday before embarking on another 
weekend training jaunt. "When I first started this, I set my goal to walk 
across all the major walkable bodies of water in the world. . . . I've had this 
one in my mind for many years." 
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of Lynne Cox, a Los Alamitos woman who swam across the 
Bering Strait in 1987, Hodes began contacting the appropriate Soviet and 
American officials about a month ago. He met with Alexander Kozlovsky, the 
Soviet deputy director for physical culture and sport during the summer's 
Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, also with Cox's help, he has reached everybody he needs, from the 
two Alaskan senators to a helicopter mail service. And things are rolling. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, he said, is to fly from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska, and then take a 
small bush plane over to Whales, a tiny Eskimo village at the tip of the Bering 
peninsula. With luck, he will catch a helicopter shuttle to the American island 
of Little Diomede and set off the next day to walk to Uelen. 
</P>
<P>
With water and air temperatures expected to hover between 30 and 40 degrees, 
this walk will be, by far, the coldest one that Hodes has undertaken. The 
22-mile journey, roughly the same length as the English Channel, should take 
him about seven hours, depending on the waves and winds. 
</P>
<P>
For the journey, Hodes hopes to be accompanied by both Soviet and American 
ships. The idea is to demonstrate mutual cooperation, he said, and to show that 
the diplomatic channels closed years ago are now open. 
</P>
<P>
Once he arrives, there will be a ceremonial gift exchange with some of the 
people who have helped him on his journey. Then it's back home again by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
So, with a month before he heads out, Hodes is pushing his workouts. Each 
weekend, he spends one day on the water, walking from his home near Crystal 
Cove to Laguna Beach and back. He also tries to get out on the ocean at least 
once during the week. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Hodes' trip will cost him roughly $15,000. He is hoping to get 
corporate sponsorship, but so far has not heard from the companies that he has 
contacted. But, as he says, the cost of the trip should not be an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it for the athletic challenge, but more than anything, I do it because 
your time on this world is limited," he said.

SCARS IN LAGUNA CANYON LAND ENRAGE ENVIRONMENTALISTS

<P>
Environmentalists said Saturday that they will ask the City Council to make 
sure that parts of Laguna Canyon, where bulldozers carved several roads late 
last week, are restored to their natural state. 
</P>
<P>
The pathways were etched into the hillsides about a mile north of El Toro Road 
to allow drilling equipment to be transported up the hill so toll road-related 
tests can be conducted, Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The testing site, known as Sycamore Hills, marks the spot where the proposed 
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor would cut through Laguna Canyon. 
According to Frank, the tests were ordered by the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, which is charged with building three county toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said he granted approval for the testing on the city-owned property but 
was unaware that roads were going to be cut in the area. He said no roads were 
cut when similar tests were conducted a year ago. Agency officials will replant 
the hillsides when testing is finished in about a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have given me both written and oral assurances they will restore the 
area," Frank said. "And, if necessary, they will bring in a separate 
landscaping contractor to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists were still fuming Saturday over the disruption of what 
they say is a precious wildlife habitat. Some preservationists said they will 
stage a protest in front of the hillsides Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the heart of the canyon and visually, it's scarred," said local 
conservationist Beth Leeds. "We want to know when it's going to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Corridor Agencies officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Phillips, Laguna Greenbelt executive director, said he hiked in the 
hills Friday and saw up to a mile of roads leading to at least seven graded 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very saddened and upset that this happened," Phillips said. "It's 
unnecessary from the point of view that I believe had the city known what they 
had planned, they wouldn't have let it happen. But the city didn't ask to see a 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said Laguna Greenbelt members will ask the City Council to "review and 
approve" any restoration plan. Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick said such council 
involvement would be "appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are currently negotiating with the Irvine Co. to halt the 
3,200-home Laguna Laurel development on property near Sycamore Hills. Laguna 
Beach also opposes construction of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
For now, environmentalists say they want the hills returned to their natural 
state, to whatever degree that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, habitat is never quite the same after it's been 
disturbed," Phillips said. "But it's happened. We just want to see it restored 
in the best way possible."

FAISON HAS BIG NIGHT; RAMS BEAT CARDINALS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: ROOKIE RECEIVER CATCHES TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN 27-7 VICTORY OVER 
PHOENIX.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before the season opener, the three-man battle for the Rams' starting 
tailback job has given way to a three-man race at another position -- backup 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have imagined in July that someone named Derrick Faison would push 
Curt Warner out of the spotlight? 
</P>
<P>
In the Rams' 27-7 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals before 44,134 at Anaheim 
Stadium Saturday night, the tailback race between Gaston Green and Warner 
fizzled for the moment. Green gained 21 yards in nine carries; Warner had 24 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for the team's No. 4 receiver spot, however, turned up a notch, 
especially when the team's only healthy starter, Henry Ellard, left the game in 
the first quarter because of a strained groin. Ellard did manage to get the 
first reception of the summer for the starting receiving corps, catching a 
nine-yard pass over the middle with 13:18 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the night was left for the likes of Faison, a rookie free agent who 
is competing with Tim Stallworth and Tony Lomack for one open position. 
</P>
<P>
Against Phoenix, Faison had scoring receptions of 26 and 23 yards and finished 
with four catches for 73 yards, and he could have had more. 
</P>
<P>
Faison beat his man deep in the first quarter but quarterback Jim Everett left 
the pass short and Faison couldn't hold on to the ball. Faison came back with 
an 11-yard reception later in the drive on a play in which his defender, Jay 
Taylor, was called for pass interference. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Faison added a 26-yard scoring reception to put the Rams 
ahead, 20-0. Faison made that play while having his face-mask yanked by Tracey 
Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Faison made another juggling catch over the middle for a 
23-yard touchdown, putting the Rams ahead by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Faison? He's a 6-foot-4 rookie from Howard University who played 
basketball his senior year in college, not football. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Faison is capable of big plays," Coach John Robinson said. "He's 
got some stuff that's unusual, I think all three men are going to play in the 
NFL. We've got some decisions to make, but they've done an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly as impressive as Faison was Lomack, the ninth-round pick from Florida. 
He finished with two catches for 91 yards, including an 80-yard scoring pass 
from Everett late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lomack suffered a strained hamstring near the end of his scoring run 
and couldn't return for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
That left the door open for Stallworth, who didn't have a catch in the first 
half. He made up for it with a difficult catch on a 27-yard pass from 
quarterback Chuck Long on the Rams' first drive of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem for the Ram receivers is health. When Stallworth was forced 
from the game in the second half because of a bruised right toe, it left Faison 
as the only available receiver with a chance to make the team. Also unavailable 
were Ellard, Aaron Cox (hamstring) and Flipper Anderson (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm as worried about this football team as any that I've had coming 
this close to the season," Robinson said. "We've had an unbelievable number of 
injures. We lost Ellard again to groin, we don't think it's serious. But it's 
the same routine, we can't seem to get any rhythm at wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Everett received his most extensive work of the summer, playing the entire 
first half. For the night, he completed 10 of 19 passes for 193 yards with one 
touchdown and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was sharp for most of the opening drive, taking his team from its 
23-yard line to the Phoenix 20 before having a pass intended for Henry Ellard 
intercepted in the end zone by safety Tim McDonald for a touch back. 
</P>
<P>
Long had his best day as a Ram, completing seven of 10 passes for 155 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' first score was set up by new corner Bobby Humphery, who intercepted 
his second pass of the summer in the second quarter when he stepped in front of 
a Timm Rosenbach pass and returned it nine yards to the Phoenix 22. Four plays 
later, Mike Lansford kicked a 37-yard field goal to give the Rams a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford added a 26-yarder in the second quarter and the Rams extended the lead 
to 13-0 at the half on Lomack's 80-yard scoring catch. 
</P>
<P>
As for other brewing exhibition topics, the Rams' punting problems became only 
more pronounced in the presence of Cardinals' punter Rich Camarillo, who was 
released by the Rams in 1988 after Dale Hatcher returned from a training camp 
injury. The Rams, remember, gave up on Hatcher after 1989 and left him 
unprotected on Plan B free agency and he signed with Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's first punt traveled 50 yards; the second he punched 35 yards to the 
Rams' 10, and he closed the half with a 52-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Rams rookie Kent Elmore's first punt wobbled end-over-end for 34 
yards. Hank Ilesic, also in the running, did manage a 51-yard kick late in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said of the team's punting situation: "We'll make a decision tomorrow 
or the next day on that. I think we'll leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rookie free agent Derrick Faison started at wide receiver in place of Flipper 
Anderson, who was sidelined because of a sore right hamstring. . . . Welcome to 
the league: Former Indiana running back Anthony Thompson, the Cardinals' first 
draft pick, was stopped for no gain on his first NFL carry after a crushing 
tackle by safety Vince Newsome. Thompson ended his holdout with the team this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
These Rams did not play because of injuries: tackles Irv Pankey (back) and Rob 
Cox (ribs), cornerback Darryl Henley (hip), Cleveland Gary (back), defensive 
tackle Brian Smith (knee), linebackers Fred Strickland (hamstring) and Mel 
Owens (back), receiver Aaron Cox and nose tackle Sean Smith (ankle).

LITTLE LEAGUE: ORANGE COUNTY TEAM FAILS TO SQUEEZE HOME TYING RUN IN FINAL 
INNING OF 5-4 LOSS TO SHIPPENSBURG, PA.

<P>
Twenty-five thousand spectators surrounded them. Network television cameras 
zoomed in. A couple of well-paid baseball analysts critiqued their every move 
and thousands of amateur analysts chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure-cooker conditions surrounding Saturday's semifinal game at 
the 44th Little League World Series, the Cypress Little League All-Stars 
managed to look fairly calm and composed. 
</P>
<P>
Then they took the field. 
</P>
<P>
Six innings and four crucial errors later, Cypress had been eliminated, 5-4, by 
Shippensburg, Pa., the local favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Shippensburg will play Taiwan, a 20-1 winner over Trail, British Columbia, for 
the Little League World Series title at 10 a.m. (PDT)today. Taiwan has produced 
13 Little League World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress goes home, where it thought it would be long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, being No. 2 in the nation isn't bad," said Cypress Manager Gary 
Shelton, referring to the fact that Saturday's game determined the U.S. Little 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
But beating Shippensburg undoubtably would have been better. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, which led, 3-0, after two innings, had a chance for a dramatic rally 
in the bottom of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-4, Cypress seemed to have gotten a lucky break when Eddie Zamora 
led off by reaching third on throwing errors by pitcher David Orndorff and 
right fielder Chuck Halter. 
</P>
<P>
With no outs and Zamora on third, Shelton brought in pinch hitter Joe Katchka, 
and signaled for a bunt. Katchka's bunt rolled right to Orndorff, who looked to 
third, holding Zamora, and then threw to first. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora hesitated, then took off for home, but first baseman Bobby Knox, taking 
several steps toward home, threw home and Zamora was tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
The Shippensburg fans stood and cheered wildly, waiting for the final out. As 
Orndorff began his windup to Mark Slevcove, Shippensburg fans broke into a 
furious chant of, "LET'S GO SHIP! LET'S GO SHIP!" 
</P>
<P>
Slevcove grounded to shortstop Scott Thrush, who made a routine throw to first 
for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie's the fastest kid on our team," Shelton said about the squeeze attempt. 
"We've scored on that play a thousand times." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shippensburg Manager Glen Orndorff, the pitcher's father: "I said, 
'They're going to squeeze it.' I told my son to look the runner back, and they 
just executed." 
</P>
<P>
Although they managed a 3-0 lead in the second inning, and pitcher Bobby Brito 
did not allow a hit until the fifth inning, Cypress looked shaky defensively 
along the way. Many of the players blamed big-game jitters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real nervous," first baseman Jake Koziel said. "When I got up to bat, I 
couldn't even grip it I was shaking so much. I had to call time and step out of 
the box. . . I've never been like that before." 
</P>
<P>
Shippensburg scored two unearned runs in the third to cut its deficit to 3-2. 
In the fifth, Bobby Shannon gave the Pennsylvanians a 5-3 lead, hitting the 
first pitch over the left-field fence and scoring behind Orndorff. 
</P>
<P>
Orndorff's infield single had scored Jimmy Smith, who reached first and 
advanced on errors. 
</P>
<P>
"Before he went up to bat, I told him to hit one," Glen Orndorff said. "He 
looked at me and shook his head and just said, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' Kerry Cordero hit a solo homer in the fifth over the left-field wall 
to cut Shippensburg's lead to 5-4. Brito struck out three in the sixth, but 
Cypress could not score the tying run. in bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Brito allowed three hits and five runs (all unearned) and struck out 
10. He walked three. 
</P>
<P>
Orndorff gave up five hits and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching's not what got us," Shelton said. "It's our blasted errors." 
</P>
<P>
Added coach Ron MacDonald: "I think they really felt the pressure today. There 
were too many simple mistakes. Our shortstop was extremely nervous before the 
game. All the players were." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress left fielder Matt Mims disagreed: "I wasn't nervous. I know we can beat 
them. We just made mistakes. (Because of Wednesday's and Thursday's rain) we 
didn't get to practice. . . 
</P>
<P>
"But we made it this far. We're second-best in the nation, and third or fourth 
in the world. I don't think I'll ever forget it. I don't think that would be 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Little League Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Manager Gary Shelton had to remove his son, Matt, one of the team's 
best hitters, from the lineup two hours before Saturday's game because of a 
sore shoulder. "It's tough to be told right before the biggest game in your 
life, especially by your own father, that you can't play," Gary Shelton said. . 
. . Shelton, looks forward to returning home after two weeks of tournament play 
on the road. "We've spent two weeks sleeping on cots, living in barracks with 
these kids. I want to sleep in my own bed. I want to shower in my own shower. 
My wife and I have been trying to fit in a trip to Vegas for the last two 
weeks, but we keep winning and keep canceling Vegas. Now if we go to Vegas, 
I'll probably just sleep the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Crowd reception of Taiwan improved a bit Saturday. During the week, many in the 
crowd booed Taiwan, which has produced teams that have won the Little League 
World Series 13 times. But after Taiwan defeated Trail, 20-1, Saturday morning, 
the crowd of about 7,500 gave the team a warm applause, and later a standing 
ovation when the Taiwan players gathered on the mound, formed a circle and 
bowed gracefully toward the stands . . . Taiwan's 20-1 victory nearly matched 
Taiwan's 21-1 victory over Northwood Irvine in the 1987 title game . . . 
British Columbia's Kelly Craig, the only girl playing in the Little League 
World Series, did not fare too well. Craig started at first base, where she had 
a throwing error, was moved to catcher (two passed balls), and went 0 for 3, 
striking out twice. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Little League umpire Skipper Carillo of Laguna Beach was honored with 
an introduction during pre-game ceremonies . . . Little League baseball 
announced Saturday that an alcohol and drug abuse education program will be 
implemented in the league in 1991, with Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser as its 
spokesman. . . Shippensburg will be the first Pennsylvania team to play in a 
Little League world championship since 1967. That year, Tokyo, Japan defeated 
Edgemont, Pa., 4-1 in the title game. Pennsylvania's last championship came in 
1960, when Levitttown, Pa., beat Ft. Worth, Tex., 5-0.

1) Rich Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the Rams already cut Camarillo. In 1988. Camarillo punted 40 times for 
the Rams that season, averaged just shy of 40 yards per kick, had no punts 
blocked and was dropped just as soon as Dale Hatcher returned from the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Now Camarillo punts for the Phoenix Cardinals, who shared the Anaheim Stadium 
turf with the Rams Saturday night. The Cardinals lost, 27-7, but Camarillo 
proved a long lost point with two kicks of 50 yards and another of 44, two of 
them placing the football inside the Ram 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that to the disabled state of the Rams' present punting game. Elmore 
was booed before he delivered his first attempt Saturday, a premonition on the 
crowd's part. Elmore delivered a squib of 34 yards and didn't kick again. 
Ilesic was allowed one punt in the second half and produced a spiraling 
51-yarder, 16 1/2 yards better than the 34.5 average he took into the game. 
</P>
<P>
One good kick . . . and a race may have been won. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make a decision (Sunday) or the next day," Coach John Robinson 
said of his team's on-going punt-off. "I think it's best to leave it at that. 
We'll have specific plans about our punting early this week." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to like Elmore's chances today. Or Ilesic's, if the Rams are able to 
swing a deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram tailback position, from the start, has been Warner's to lose. With a 
bad back temporarily ousting Gary from contention, Warner's lone competition 
this summer has been the heretofore non-competitive Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a lock but halfway through the preseason, Green was 
averaging 5.3 yards a carry to Warner's 2.3, looking swifter by the step and 
very much the on-the-field front-runner. Before Saturday, Warner's best assets 
had been loads of impressive Seattle game film and the ever-lasting support of 
his head coach, an important asset to have. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, there was a lot of wheel-spinning in the Ram offensive backfield. 
Green ran nine times, Warner eight. Green gained 21 yards, Warner 24. This was 
primarily a night for passing -- Ram quarterbacks Jim Everett and Chuck Long 
combined to throw for 348 yards -- but it was also the first night that Warner 
displayed a flash or two. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Warner took a pitch from Everett, accelerated left and 
got outside, clearing the end for a six-yard sprint into the end zone. It would 
have been Warner's first score of the summer but fullback Robert Delpino was 
flagged for holding and the Rams were pushed back 10 yards, eventually settling 
for a field goal by Mike Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
Warner ran two more times, for gains of seven and six yards, before retiring to 
the sidelines with the Rams milking a 20-point lead. Green carried the ball 
three times in the second half, netted five yards and generally left the 
appearance of having returned to earth. 
</P>
<P>
The bid for fourth wide receiver, at first glance, doesn't seem particularly 
significant. But at second glance, the Rams' first three wide receivers -- 
Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox -- are injured and unavailable for 
duty, leaving three rookies named Faison, Lomack and Stallworth to compete for 
some potentially serious playing time. 
</P>
<P>
By night's end, Lomack and Stallworth were also banged up, leaving Robinson 
with one more reason to sidle up to Faison, the gangly raw talent who goes by 
the handle Big Bird around Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
Faison caught two touchdown passes and Lomack grabbed one, but by the time he 
concluded his 80-yard dash through the Phoenix secondary, Lomack was also 
grabbing his right hamstring. Stallworth wound up with one 27-yard reception 
and one badly bruised right big toe. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," Robinson said with a gleam in his eye, "Faison is capable of big 
plays. He's got some stuff.

DEVELOPER'S RISE AND FALL PARALLELED THE FORTUNES OF SAVINGS AND LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: LIKE SOME S&amp;LS, KENNETH GOOD NEVER MET A DEAL HE DIDN'T LIKE. NOW, 
WITH THE INDUSTRY AT ROCK BOTTOM, THE DENVER BUSINESSMAN IS SWIMMING IN RED 
INK.

TAMPA, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth M. Good wore a jogging suit the night he clinched one of the biggest 
land deals of his high-flying career. 
</P>
<P>
It was January, 1985, and Good was racing in fast times. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan money machines were in overdrive, real estate was hot, and 
Florida swarmed with speculators who had cash or knew how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Good swaggered into town from Denver and pledged nearly $38 million cash for 
5,400 acres of Spanish moss-draped woodlands north of Tampa. Plans for fine 
homes, offices and a highbrow country club were envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the unfinished Tampa Palms development is controlled by two 
banks and up for sale, another victim of a faltering real estate market. Good 
says his net worth has plummeted from $100 million into the red. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators have grilled Good about links to the failed 
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Denver and a scandal that has 
ensnared President Bush's son Neil. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel no shame," the 45-year-old Good told the House Banking Committee 
recently. "Shame implies guilt. I think I was as much a victim of the markets 
as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The saga of Ken Good is a microcosm of the S&amp;L crisis: risky ventures, 
free-spending splendor, collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Deeply indebted to Silverado and others, Good managed to convince the 
financially troubled owners of the Tampa site that he was their savior. 
</P>
<P>
People familiar with the negotiating session said Good attended the final 
signing in a jogging suit, a symbolic reflection of his go-go personality. But 
ultimately, he came up with less than half the $38 million he promised. Site 
owners agreed to let him finance the rest. 
</P>
<P>
He then used Tampa Palms as collateral for loans and a $70-million high-risk 
"junk bond" issue to finance other ventures, including the $250 million 
debt-financed takeover of Gulfstream Land &amp; Development Corp, one of 
Florida's major builders. 
</P>
<P>
Good looked like the best thing that ever happened to Tampa until his mounting 
debts and the slowing real estate market toppled his empire. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say? It's the story of the last couple years," said James 
Apthorp, a former Gulfstream executive kept on as consultant at Tampa Palms 
after foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Good, a Methodist minister's son raised in a Kansas farm town, followed 
prosperity around the nation with what acquaintances call a barnstormer's zeal. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he formed Good Financial Corp. in Dallas and began amassing properties 
before a slump in the late 1970s. Stuck with dozens of sites and no buyers, 
Good dissolved the company in 1979 and moved to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains that Good honed his flamboyant 
personality and enlarged his network of high-profile connections. 
</P>
<P>
Good helped found a home-building company, Talley Corp., which became one of 
Denver's most successful developers. He resigned as chairman and sold his share 
for an undisclosed amount in January, 1986, just before the end of Denver's oil 
boom. Talley liquidated later that year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Good had become a star in Denver's social scene. He tossed money to 
charities and sipped champagne with the city's elite. A lavish party marked the 
opening of his $10-million mansion, decorated with contemporary art and 
expensive furniture -- later used as collateral for real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
Good's circle of influential friends included Neil Bush, a Silverado director. 
Years later, the links between the two were still strong. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed with the House Banking Committee show Good's Silverado debt was 
reduced by $8 million shortly after Gulfstream agreed to invest more than $3 
million in JNB Exploration Co., an oil and gas partnership managed by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction also reduced Bush's personal liability in a line of credit for 
JNB. Bush, who appeared before the House panel in May, denied any improprieties 
in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Silverado, seized by federal regulators in December, 1988, has been the target 
of some Democrats who question whether the Administration moved too slowly 
against the thrift and are too lenient with Neil Bush. Thrift regulators have 
denied the allegations, but decline to specifically discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Silverado lost an estimated $31 million on Good's speculative investments in 
Colorado. Cost of the Silverado bailout is estimated at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an uncanny sense of timing for business," Bush said of Good two years 
ago. Bush did not return telephone calls for comment on this article. 
</P>
<P>
Good swept into Tampa in late 1984 unknown, but quickly crafted a reputation as 
a free-wheeling visionary. He billed Tampa Palms -- strategically located near 
an interstate highway -- as one of the "best pieces of dirt" east of the 
Mississippi and a future national showplace. 
</P>
<P>
His image was further enhanced by the quick acquisition of Gulfstream, based in 
Plantation, Fla., upping his portfolio to more than 30,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
He poured money into Tampa Palms, adding a fancy clubhouse and exquisite 
landscaping. He staged grand news conferences each step of the way and 
cultivated the local press with personally guided tours of the property. 
</P>
<P>
He was toasted by politicians, courted by the chamber of commerce and revered 
as a deity by fellow developers. A builder at a trade meeting, where Good was a 
guest speaker, introduced him simply as "Mr. God." 
</P>
<P>
He wore silk suits and drove a maroon Maserati. Weekends might find him flying 
to Monte Carlo or New York aboard his six-seat private jet. On election night 
in 1988, Good flew to Houston for President Bush's victory party. 
</P>
<P>
Good's own party in Tampa soured with the economy. Tampa Palms sales slowed, 
business relocations fell through, lenders pressed for payments. It was Dallas 
and Denver all over again. Ironically, billboards for Tampa Palms proclaim, "It 
Only Happens Once." 
</P>
<P>
Good himself dismissed talk of his demise. In one of his last public speeches, 
in May, 1989, Good labeled the rumors "cocktail conversation" and unveiled 
plans for other projects. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a group of lenders and junk-bond holders agreed to swap more than 
$200 million in debt for control of Tampa Palms, other properties and 
Gulfstream. Good was ousted from the company. 
</P>
<P>
During negotiations, the lenders forced Good to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"They would not even let him in the room," said Apthorp. "They had so lost 
confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Good faced bank foreclosure on his posh Tampa Palms home, averted 
only by a last-minute payment. His Denver home fetched $3.3 million at an 
auction last October. 
</P>
<P>
Good has pulled up stakes again, this time to New York. He's expressed interest 
in becoming a commodities broker. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in New York by telephone, Good said he now never comments to the press. 
Good's attorney, Gil Thurm, said he has no comment on his client. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what his plans are," said Charles Knight, a Tampa real 
estate appraiser and friend of Good's. "But a man that's been able to do what's 
he's done -- you're not going to keep him down."

WESTMINSTER HIGH CLASS OF '65 RODE A WILD WAVE INTO THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quarter-century ago, we were the future: the first wave of baby boomers to 
graduate from high school and step out into the world. 
</P>
<P>
And step into it we did. 
</P>
<P>
The Class of '65 graduated the year Watts exploded, the year the first American 
walked in space and the year the government began drafting 18-year-olds with a 
vengeance as it started committing front-line troops to the war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
We were the last class of innocents. For most of us, drugs were something they 
did in L.A. or New York. And protesting had something to do with all that fuss 
in the South. The hipper of us had heard of Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger, but 
mostly it was Beatles and Beach Boys, Righteous Brothers and Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
But we caught on pretty fast. After high school, we got noisy, grew long hair 
and adopted rock 'n' roll as a generational anthem. We discovered drugs and 
free love and free speech and despised capitalists. We later gave the world 
yuppies, high-technology entrepreneurs, born-again Christians and the anti-drug 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
With weighty thoughts like these threatening to turn the evening turgid, I 
decided several months ago to shake off old anxieties and attend my 25th high 
school reunion. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be my first time back, and it caused more than one anxiety attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Geez, dad, it's only high school," my 8-year-old daughter said during one of 
my hyperventilating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
You see, high school wasn't my forte. I wasn't even energetic enough to join 
the nerds, who at least got good grades and had their own cliques. It wasn't 
hard after graduation to lose touch with classroom acquaintances because I 
never had that many. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 15 years since I'd seen a fellow graduate, no mean feat considering 
that I graduated from Westminster High School and haven't had a permanent 
residence more than 15-miles-distant in the ensuing 2 1/2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
But I squared my shoulders and determined to go. Nervous as I was about 
visiting that far back in my past, I was curious to see how my class of '65 had 
turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Cessna -- drill team2; choir3; pep club2,3; honor roll4 -- surprised me 
reunion night with the admission that she had undergone the same mix of 
curiosity and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the 10th reunion and found myself in a corner the whole night. I was 
so miserable that I skipped the 15th because I was sure it would be a repeat." 
</P>
<P>
What Cessna, who has been a county juvenile probation officer for the 21 years 
since college, found is that no matter what we go on to do, and no matter how 
much we grow, when we go back we revert to the emotional roles we played then. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to one of the football stars," Cessna said after the reunion, 
"and he told me he was glad he came because he'd felt so unhappy and isolated 
in high school, and he was finally able to shake that self-image. And I 
thought, 'Guuuy! We all thought you were soooo bitchin'!' " 
</P>
<P>
Cessna said she'd decided to confront her own ghosts by forcing herself into 
the middle of things. 
</P>
<P>
"So for the 20th reunion, I joined the organizing committee and ended up having 
a blast." 
</P>
<P>
The WHS '65 group, 16 strong, worked for almost 8 months on the reunion, which 
was held Aug. 11 at the Irvine Marriott Hotel. Cessna was typical of the 
reunion organizers -- active and popular in school, but rarely the social 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Clark Redding -- drama club2,3; honor roll2; drill team3; speech and 
debate club4; school newspaper4; banner girl4 -- offered one explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The prom queens and superjocks, she said, tended to be "people who were really 
exceptional, so they stood out in high school, but maybe they didn't have to 
work very hard for the attention they got." 
</P>
<P>
"When you are in the drill team or debating someone from another school," she 
said, "you are doing it as much for the honor of your school as for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you start organizing a reunion, why that takes months of hard work. 
The people on the committees, I think, are people who cared more about the 
school and their friends than about their own images." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster High was founded in 1959 as the second campus in the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District. It served the largely working-class families 
settling into the growing sea of hastily built tract homes that were 
surrounding the small pioneer city of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 In stark contrast to the multiracial Westminster High School of today -- 46% 
Anglo, 26% Latino and 24% Asian, mainly Vietnamese, with a smattering of 
Pacific Islanders and American Indians -- the senior class of 1965 was almost 
totally white. 
</P>
<P>
 We were 88% Anglo and 10% Latino with a handful of Japanese-Americans whose 
parents once had owned much of the area's fertile farmland but lost it in the 
anti-Japanese fervor of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The class of '65 was made up largely of the sons and daughters of aerospace 
and construction workers, farm laborers, local merchants and retired and active 
military men who had seen Orange County while passing through during World War 
II or the Korean War and had determined to settle amid its sprawling orange 
groves and truck farms. 
</P>
<P>
 My father first saw the county while in the Navy, and we moved there in 1955. 
The house my parents bought (for $11,500, with 4% interest and a $1 down 
payment) was just a half-block from a dairy farm. I was in high school when the 
dairy came down in the county's second wave of development to make room for 
another housing tract -- one with some of the greenest lawns you'll ever see. 
</P>
<P>
 My last clear memory of Kim Keturakis -- swimming2,3,4; water polo3; varsity 
club3,4 -- was of the ride he gave me one day in his red Triumph TR-3. It was a 
ride that confirmed my long-distance love affair with sports cars and led me to 
my first one, a 1965 Alfa Romeo that I bought used in 1967 and went broke 
trying to keep running. 
</P>
<P>
Keturakis didn't have a mustache in high school, and he wore horn-rimmed 
glasses back then, so I can probably be forgiven for not recognizing him as we 
milled around the foyer of the hotel, waiting to get pictures taken for the 
reunion memory book. 
</P>
<P>
A military brat like me, he enlisted in the Navy soon after graduating and 
spent four years as a gunfire control technician, including 20 months in the 
Vietnam war zone, where the LST on which he was stationed broached in a 
tropical storm and broke up on offshore reefs. 
</P>
<P>
"All I remember is that the storm kicked up waves that were 30 or 40 feet high, 
and all of a sudden we were being pushed onto the rocks. It just happened so 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
No one was killed in the wreck, but three shipmates were lost "to dumb, stupid 
accidents" during the 3-month salvage effort that followed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Being a shipwrecked gunfire control technician might not sound like much to 
bring back to civilian life, but it introduced Keturakis to computers. 
</P>
<P>
It also introduced him to the shocking facts "that returning vets, in 1969, 
weren't heroes and that girl's skirts were a lot shorter than when I left." 
</P>
<P>
Keturakis enrolled at Fullerton College -- where he met his wife of 19 years -- 
and later transferred to Cal State Fullerton where he earned an undergraduate 
degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year stint as a contracts administrator and marketing analyst at Western 
Digital Corp. led him to discover that sales were a lot more exciting than the 
financial side of business, so he hopped into a series of sales jobs with 
several area computer firms. 
</P>
<P>
"But that just taught me that I had trouble working for someone else," he said. 
"So in 1977, more as a matter of survival than anything else, I started my own 
company" customizing, selling and installing data communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
Keturakis recently announced a corporate reorganization at his firm, DMA 
Communications in Irvine -- a reorganization, he said, that leaves him "pretty 
much retired." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Basically, I got bored. The company has done pretty well, so this leaves 
me free to pursue other things. I'd like to get involved with a start-up 
company or two, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 90 of the 120 graduates who attended the reunion -- the lowest turnout 
ever -- returned the information sheets that were mailed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Sue Turner Crutchfield -- drill team2,3,4; student government2 -- 
suggested that the drop-off from the 20th occurred "because we've all gone past 
40 since then, and it probably bothered some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the fact that fully half the graduates have dropped out of 
sight, either through ennui or because they've moved away and lost touch. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the 90 of us, there are 187 children. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been at least 35 divorces, two classmates are widows and one is a 
widower. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of us graduated from college with a bachelor's degree and a third more 
have 2-year degrees. There are four law degrees, two MBAs and 10 masters of art 
or science. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are 11 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Rossman Stevens -- Latin club1,2,3,4; honor roll1,2,3,4; pep club1; 
and chemistry club3 -- recalled that throughout junior high school and the 
first 2 years of high school she was often reduced to tears by classmates' 
taunts about her size. 
</P>
<P>
By her junior year, however, she had lost considerable weight. And 25 years of 
conscientious diet and exercise -- for a while she studied, and then taught, 
belly dancing -- brought a slim and trim Stevens to the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"But nobody can know how hard it was for me to come here," she confided late 
into the evening. "So many of these people hurt me so much." 
</P>
<P>
Still later, after visiting with a few old friends and seeing how others 
responded to her "new" persona ("See that guy over there," she whispered at one 
point. "He made me cry all the time in junior high, and I just went up and he 
looked at me and said I hadn't changed! He didn't even remember!"), Stevens 
confided that it had been worth the trip. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Joel Stevens, had flown in from Skokie, Ill., for the 
event. It was her first reunion. 
</P>
<P>
A bad first marriage kept her from attending the fifth reunion, she said, and 
because she didn't inform the class record keepers of her address -- then in 
Texas -- she never received information about subsequent reunions. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, through a divorce and remarriage to Joel, an engineer, 
through the raising of their 17-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter, through 
the long hours she spent building her own business, Stevens had kept in touch 
with one person from Westminster High -- biology instructor Al Stone. 
</P>
<P>
That slim tie kept her thinking, as 1990 wore on, that this was the year of her 
25th reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"So finally, I called the school and got the information and made the 
reservations. I missed the other ones, but the 25th, that's something special." 
</P>
<P>
In schools across Illinois, Stevens is known as the lady puppeteer. She writes 
and performs, with puppets of her own design, shows for audiences ranging from 
kindergartners to corporate conventioneers. She also performs a "say no to 
drugs" program in demand at schools throughout the state and has done the 
puppet work for an educational video and the national television campaign that 
accompanied its release several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And when she's not on stage, she is deeply involved in the animal-rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have been involved in some kind of cause," she said. "It makes things 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Class of '65 turned out microchip engineers, plumbers, 
electricians, musicians, actors, computer programmers, corporate executives, 
carpenters and just about everything in between, including a railroad brakeman 
in Fresno, an Orange County district attorney's investigator, and a deputy 
director of the Oregon State Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hicks Bellamy -- girls athletics1,2,3,4; Spanish club1,2; pep 
club2,3,4; honor roll1,2,3,4 -- was Georgia's elementary school counselor of 
the year in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sutton -- Latin club 2,3,4; gymnastics3; student government4; chemistry 
and ski clubs3 -- is an electronics technician and, he proudly announces, the 
nation's only fully qualified dinosaur repairman -- a position he acquired when 
he answered a trade journal ad, was flown to Tokyo for training and became a 
U.S. consultant for the Kokoro Co., a manufacturer of audio-animatronic 
dinosaurs installed in various amusement parks around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a psychologist in St. Petersburg, Fla., and a cell biologist in 
Atlanta, both with doctoral degrees, who know what the Zephyruns were (the 
plural of Zephyrus, the Greek god of the west winds, and -- for some reason -- 
our senior class name). 
</P>
<P>
 Student body president Tom Risinger -- sophomore class president; junior class 
representative; football1,2,3,4; basketball1,2,3,4; baseball2,3,4; concert 
choice1,2,3,4; Christmas king4; varsity club3,4; honor roll1,2,3,4 -- a lean, 
smooth-talking and super-popular redhead, seemed to have everything going for 
him in high school, especially to a nerd like me. 
</P>
<P>
But he left for college in his native state of Oklahoma and dropped out of 
sight after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first reunion he'd attended and he seemed a lot shorter and was 
certainly a bit broader than he was 25 years ago. Almost all the high-school 
heroes seem shorter now. 
</P>
<P>
Risinger said he played baseball in college, got bad grades "until I had the 
coach for five classes one semester" and tried his hand at a singing career 
after school. 
</P>
<P>
A few years in local night spots scotched his hopes of stardom on stage, so 
Risinger took the gift of gab that had made him so popular in high school and 
put it to work behind a mike as a disc jockey in Oklahoma City nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
In a soft accent that underscores his years in the Sooner State, Risinger 
allowed as how his career never let him ascend into yuppiehood, but said he's 
been happy because 'I always had music in me, always loved it, and I still get 
to make my living with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the men in the class were in the service, most as draftees, and 
most of them saw duty in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Two classmates, Klaus Egolf and Warren Harding, are known to have been killed 
in action there, both in the same engagement. Egolf died the same day he 
arrived, when his tank company was hurled into an emergency action. 
</P>
<P>
 But committee organizers, despite protests from several veterans after the 
20th reunion, decided that the war was still too emotional and divisive an 
issue and opted to ignore it completely in the program -- an omission which did 
not raise any public comment this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster High School Class of '65 is already planning its 30th, 40th 
and 50th reunions. (The organizing committee has the 50th theme picked out -- 
"Lean 'n' Mean in 2015"). 
</P>
<P>
Figure this year's committee leader Nancy Thompson -- girls athletics1,2,3,4; 
pep club1,4; fencing4; student government4; flag girl2,3,4 -- to be in on the 
future gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
She attended all the previous reunions, held at 5-year intervals, and had been 
heavily involved in three earlier committees. She wound up chief organizer of 
the 20th when the person who'd run the 15th moved away and left her holding all 
the files. The job, she said, just followed her into the 25th. 
</P>
<P>
Her assessment of the class after five get-togethers? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess we turned out pretty good, with a lot of good people. We've got 
lawyers, detectives, airline pilots . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Things are starting to turn out better for her, too. Her marriage to a fellow 
WHS grad ended recently after 17 years and three kids, and she was sort of 
floating out there in limbo when the 25th reunion committee started up. 
</P>
<P>
She and fellow committee member Frank Sutton, a casual friend in high school, 
hit it off during all those months of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about getting married."

COVER STORY: FANTASTIC 'FANTASIA'; 
</P>
<P>
DISNEY CHANNEL TAKES A LOOK AT WALT'S GREAT EXPERIMENT IN ANIMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, Charles Solomon, a regular contributor to Calendar, is the 
author of Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fantasia," which turns 50 in November, was Walt Disney's grand attempt to 
establish animation as a legitimate art form that fused drawing, motion, 
design, choreography, sound and color. 
</P>
<P>
The film is considered a classic today, and myriad stories surround its 
creation, some of which are detailed in "Fantasia: The Creation of a Disney 
Classic," hosted by Michael Tucker of "L.A. Law" and airing Sunday at 6 p.m. on 
the Disney Channel (repeating Wednesday at 11 a.m. and Thursday at 5 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Herewith, for Mouse-aholics and everyone else, are some little-known facts 
about the animated film: 
</P>
<P>
* It all began, appropriately, with Mickey Mouse. During the 1930s, the 
rambunctious mouse of "Steamboat Willie" had become an increasingly nice guy -- 
and fallen in popularity behind Disney's Donald Duck and Goofy and, in some 
polls, the Fleischer Studio's Popeye. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a sort of comeback vehicle for Mickey, Walt Disney began work in 
1936 on a "Silly Symphony" short based on composer Paul Dukas' "The Sorcerer's 
Apprentice." 
</P>
<P>
* A chance meeting -- and the harsh realities of the movie business -- 
transformed Disney's modest project into the most ambitious feature in the 
history of animation. 
</P>
<P>
One night in late 1937, Disney was dining alone at Chasen's and saw Leopold 
Stokowski, also alone. Disney asked the conductor to join him and mentioned the 
"Sorcerer's Apprentice" during their conversation. Stokowski offered to waive 
his fee and conduct the music for the film. Disney accepted. Stokowski also 
suggested they collaborate on "a fanta-zee-ah," a full-length feature that 
would illustrate various pieces of classical music. Disney let that suggestion 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
* When the cost of "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" passed $125,000, it became clear 
that a short film couldn't possibly earn back that kind of money, and Disney 
reconsidered Stokowski's suggestion. In February, 1938, they began work on a 
film tentatively entitled "The Concert Feature." Research was done to find 
suitable musical selections, and Disney's engineers began developing an 
advanced sound system. Musicologist Deems Taylor agreed to serve as 
commentator. Stokowski would conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra for the film; 
his contract was renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
* Although animation always had been a popular amusement in America, 
avant-garde artists in Europe -- including Walter Ruttman, Viking Eggling and 
Oskar Fischinger -- had experimented with abstract animated films during the 
'20s and early '30s. So Disney hired Fischinger, who had fled Germany in 1936, 
to work on the sequence set to Stokowski's transcription of Bach's "Toccata and 
Fugue in D-Minor." 
</P>
<P>
Fischinger was accustomed to working as an independent artist and disliked the 
collaborative nature of studio animation; Disney came to feel his work was too 
abstract for the film's mass audience. After nine months, Fischinger left; his 
name was omitted from the credits. Reliable sources believe it was at his 
request because he hoped to become more famous than Disney and didn't want the 
studio to be able to exploit his participation. 
</P>
<P>
* According to studio sources, when Igor Stravinsky first saw the dinosaurs 
fighting to "The Rite of Spring," he said perhaps that was what he had in mind 
when he wrote the music. He subsequently dismissed the visuals as "an 
unresisting imbecility," damned Stokowski's performance as "execrable" and 
complained bitterly about the rearrangement of his score and the size of the 
fee he received. The tyrannosaurus and stegosaurus that meet in the climactic 
battle are far more believable than the stop-motion monsters in Hollywood 
science-fiction films, but scientists point out the two animals actually lived 
tens of millions of years apart. 
</P>
<P>
* The first sketches for the "Pastorale Symphony" sequence depicted languorous, 
bare-breasted nymphs reclining by rainbow-colored pools. The nymphs were 
transformed into centaurettes as work progressed, but the revised characters 
also were drawn topless. It's not certain whether the Hays Office, which 
supervised the moral content of films at the time, intervened or Disney feared 
that it would, but the animators added modest flower bras to their imaginary 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Pastorale" was bowdlerized in later releases to removes images deemed 
offensive to blacks. Sunflower, a pickaninny centaurette who shined the others' 
hoofs, was excised and the appearance of the Nubian/zebra centaurettes who 
attend Bacchus was trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
* Bela Lugosi was hired to pose for reference footage of Tchernobog, the black 
god of Russian legend, but Bill Tytla, the key animator, disliked the results. 
He made sequence director Wilfred Jackson take off his shirt and be 
photographed in the poses he used as references for his drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Tytla's animation of Tchernobog is widely admired by other animators for its 
sculptural three-dimensionality and extraordinary emotional power. 
</P>
<P>
* Disney originally planned to keep "Fantasia" in permanent release. His plan 
was that as new animation to additional music was completed, it would be 
substituted for one of the original eight selections: The viewer would never 
see the same film twice. Preliminary work was done for several pieces, 
including Wagner's "The Ride of the Valkyries," Sibelius' "The Swan of 
Tuonela," Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Flight of the Bumble Bee" and Debussy's 
"Claire de Lune." 
</P>
<P>
These plans were derailed by the critical and audience response to the film 
upon its initial release. The critics were divided: In Commonwealth magazine, 
Philip Hartung praised it as "a new experience of great beauty -- another 
milestone in the motion picture." The Nation's Franz Hoellering called it "a 
promising monstrosity." In a devastating review in the New York Herald, Dorothy 
Thompson wrote "Nazism is the abuse of power, the perverted betrayal of the 
instincts, the genius of a race turned into black magical destruction, and so 
is 'Fantasia.' " 
</P>
<P>
* "Fantasia" was expensive to produce: $2.28 million (estimates of what it 
would cost to make the film today range from $28 million to $50 million). 
Installing the 96-speaker Fantasound system -- a precursor of stereo -- in the 
12 theaters in which the film opened cost an additional $85,000 per theater. 
</P>
<P>
* "Fantasia" lost money on its initial release, but proved highly profitable in 
its subsequent re-releases. It began to acquire the status of a cult classic in 
1969, when it was reissued with a psychedelic poster -- and rivaled "Yellow 
Submarine" as a "head trip" film. That was three years after Walt Disney's 
death. Disney's faith in his great experiment was finally vindicated, but for 
reasons he probably would have disliked. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1981, the film was re-scored in state-of-the-art digital sound. Two-time 
Oscar winner Irwin Kostal conducted an orchestra of 127 Los Angeles musicians, 
matching Stokowski's beats to keep the music synchronized to the animation. 
Everyone agreed the new sound track was a technical wonder, but Kostal simply 
wasn't a conductor of Stokowski's stature, nor was his pick-up group the 
Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
* Disney has extensively restored both the visuals and the Stokowski sound 
track for the film's golden anniversary reissue in October. Technicians have 
been working with the original nitrate negatives and, according to studio 
sources, improved film stock and lenses will produce clearer, more detailed 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
All of which confirms Walt Disney's statement, " 'Fantasia' is timeless. It may 
run 10, 20 or 30 years. It may run after I'm gone. 'Fantasia' is an idea in 
itself. I can never build another 'Fantasia.' I can improve. I can elaborate. 
That's all."

Q &amp; A / JOAN LUNDEN: EARLY TO RISE, LAST TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While most of the headlines about morning talk shows have been directed at the 
likes of Jane Pauley, Deborah Norville and Kathleen Sullivan, Joan Lunden has 
quietly built up 10 years as co-host of ABC's top-rated "Good Morning America" 
(weekdays, 7-9 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunden joined "GMA" in 1976 as a consumer reporter. She replaced Sandy Hill as 
co-host four years later, first opposite David Hartman and for the last three 
years with Charles Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Lunden, the mother of three daughters, has become a spokeswoman for working 
mothers and has hosted two programs on parenting -- the Lifetime series 
"Mother's Day" and the syndicated "Everyday." 
</P>
<P>
She recently took on the National Enquirer on "Good Morning America" when she 
heard it was going to publish a bogus story about trouble in her marriage with 
producer Michael Krauss. "It was a scary thing to do," she says, "but I had to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lunden talked about her life as the longest-reigning co-host on early morning 
television with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations on your 10th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. Can you believe that? The show is going to have its 15th anniversary 
in November, and when I came here to New York to be a reporter on (WABC-TV's) 
"Eyewitness News," this show had just gone on the air in its present form. I 
watched it that first year, and the following fall they came to me. That was 
one of the good things about being on the news in New York -- all the network 
executives live here. 
</P>
<P>
They said, "We want someone to keep us up to date on new products and new ideas 
and lifestyles." That was kind of up my alley. I was a consumer reporter in 
California. I started working for "Good Morning America" 14 years ago this 
September. It was something I could do while still working at "Eyewitness 
News." I did both shows for almost five years. 
</P>
<P>
When did you start hosting? 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Nancy Dussault was the hostess. When she would be away, I would 
sit in for her. They didn't have me sit in completely. They would have me come 
in and do a segment called "People in the News" and maybe an interview. 
</P>
<P>
After Sandy Hill got the job, I continued to sit in, and I started doing more 
and more reports. The first time I really sat in for her was a morning when 
they called me at home half an hour into the show. I was asleep because I 
hadn't been scheduled to be on that morning, and they said, "Are you up?" They 
said David and Sandy both have laryngitis, and it hurts to listen to them. 
Fortunately, I lived right across the street from the studio so I was there 
within 10 minutes. They quickly put some blush and makeup on me, and I was 
thrown into it. You didn't have time to get scared. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Morning America" has been No. 1 in the ratings much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
When it first came on it was like this new kid on the block, and over about a 
five-year period it built and built and built. I would attribute that to the 
program itself. It was a good format and a nice, comfortable, warm set. David 
Hartman was everyman's man. By the time I came on full-time, the program had 
been solidly No. 1 for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the end of David's tenure here that the ratings slipped. ABC's 
prime time took a nose-dive, and we are affected by what people watch at night. 
</P>
<P>
That also was a time when our society was really changing, and we (women) were 
not willing to accept the dominant male and the subservient female, and that 
was clearly how our program was set up. David Hartman was supposed to be the 
star. I think that hurt us in the end. 
</P>
<P>
It was important they chose a new person . . . not to go after a name of big 
marquee value and make them a star, but to find somebody people wouldn't find 
threatening. It's an obvious friendship between me and Charlie. What you got 
was this new team of 50-50 equal, and I think that was important. You weren't 
getting that on the other programs. We slowly built our ratings. Now they say 
it's because Jane Pauley left the "Today" show that "GMA" is winning. That's 
taken some of the personal satisfaction away from it. But we have been No. 1 
for 31 weeks, not that I am counting. 
</P>
<P>
You get up every morning at 3:30 to do the show. It must be difficult to juggle 
your work schedule and find time to be a mom and wife. 
</P>
<P>
For me as a working mom, I know by getting up at 3:30 a.m. I'm out of here at 
10 or 10:30 a.m. and can do all the things I want to for my kids. I am that 
person who can get their cake and eat it, too. There are not that many women, 
working moms, who can say they have the kind of job I do, very high-profile, 
very challenging, great responsibility, and still be a full-time mother. 
Usually those two can't mix; one has got to give. 
</P>
<P>
What have been your most memorable moments on the show? 
</P>
<P>
Flying the jet trainer (a T-34 naval flight-training plane) was definitely the 
highlight. It was so much fun. Interviewing people like Prince Charles, world 
leaders, covering the inaugurations -- those are always high points. 
</P>
<P>
Do you ever get tongue-tied while interviewing someone? 
</P>
<P>
Sure. I asked Candice Bergen the other day about her late father, Charlie 
McCarthy. She said, "That's OK. That's a mistake that has been made a million 
times." (Her father was Charlie McCarthy's puppeteer, Edgar Bergen.) You think, 
"How could I have done that?" But you read reams of research before you go in 
and there is so much on your mind.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 26 pages devoted to the subject of remodeling ("Home Renovation," July 8), 
exactly one architect is given less than 2 1/2 column inches of space, and this 
to comment on how not to exceed one's budget. The message seems clear: If you 
want to overpay someone to produce your project as though it were merely a 
solution to the problem posed by all those pesky, hidebound rules, regulations 
and technical issues, hire an architect; but if you're in the market to be 
dazzled, if only the latest "bold, angular shapes and idiosyncratically earthy 
palette" will do, if you too are after "that Zen quality" and want to be 
"connected to this other huge thing that is much bigger than we are," then you 
need to find this moment's hippest, coolest, hottest designer and assume that 
whatever problems may arise will be dwarfed by the sheer magnitude of his or 
her artistic revelation. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that no one even thinks about being killed by structural collapse, 
caught in a fire trap or risking a dangerous fall when entering buildings today 
is that the regulations under which they are produced, while not perfect, 
actually do have some basis in laws of nature (such as gravity) and in the 
public welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing is the mechanism by which the state seeks to ensure that these 
principles are respected so that the public will not encounter dangerous 
buildings. I do not assert that no licensed architect designs ugly work, nor do 
I deny that architecture is essentially an artistic pursuit; yet I can't help 
feeling that truly profound work is cognizant of its causes as well as its 
effects, integrating both the desires of the owner and architect and the 
requirements imposed by both natural and human laws into a harmonious, whole 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times Magazine has chosen to concentrate on glossy surface effects, 
which is foolish enough; what is worse, you have done so to the point of 
holding up concern for the architect's responsibility to ridicule.

Josh Schweitzer's creative design of the Hollywood photographer's studio 
("Joshing Around," by Karen Stabiner) fails to incorporate certain elements 
required by building codes and safety considerations. His stairways are lovely 
design elements but are not suitable for use. 
</P>
<P>
Stairs with 18-inch risers provide challenging training for firefighters but 
are a real problem when a fire occurs. And "tall, spry" individuals aren't the 
only ones who might need to negotiate those stairs under ordinary 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the absence of railings and balusters on the stairs presents a very 
serious hazard to the owner's 4-year-old son and others. The kid is reported to 
be sort of sliding down the steps; if he slides off at the top he could be dead 
or paralyzed. And the owner is gambling that no adult will ever stumble on the 
high, unfamiliar stairsteps and need the railing for support. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the building codes require such components. I wonder why (or 
whether) the building department permitted this design. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that art and safety come into such conflict, but why can't 
artists take practical considerations into account in designs intended for 
practical use?

A designer who is unfamiliar with building codes or refuses to adhere to 
recognized minimum standards of life safety does a disservice to his or her 
client. A case in point is the "whitewashed temple of light" designed by 
Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
It may be a piece of sculpture, but it is in violation of many minimum 
building-code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Each stairway is approximately twice as steep as is allowed, neither has a 
handrail, and open sides require guardrails. The one guardrail shown is much 
too low to be in compliance with the code. 
</P>
<P>
This remodeling job (I assume) had to have been done without the benefit of 
plans being reviewed by the local building department or a permit being issued 
because these violations are so flagrant. These are the types of improvements 
that have to be listed as non-conforming when trying to sell a house and may 
have to be corrected. A client would be pretty distressed in later years to 
learn that he couldn't sell his house (or piece of art) as is. 
</P>
<P>
If a client brought this article to me and asked for something similar, I would 
have to tell him it couldn't be done. I don't know of any contractors that 
would jeopardize their licenses by building this space.

Schweitzer's casual disregard for the profession of architecture is glib and 
irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot be a professional until he or she has been recognized by the 
profession. I would suggest that the only rationalization for eschewing a 
license stems from fear and insecurity rather than from a holier-than-thou 
arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Stick to picking paint and wallpaper, Mr. Schweitzer, or see if you can pass 
the test.

All the articles dealing with home remodeling had a common message. For some 
reason, the "beautiful people" think that if they spend enough money on 
something, it won't be ugly. The photos in the magazine prove this notion to be 
false.

CRITIC'S PICK: 'BULL DURHAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sheila Benson

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this sweet and sexy comedy set around a rat-poor minor-league baseball team, 
the Durham Bulls, writer-director Ron Shelton is absolutely the diamond's best 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
He has packed his off-beat love story with a handful of resonant characters, 
all of whom, in one way or another, worship Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon, 
center). The veteran catcher on the team (Kevin Costner, left) has the task of 
smatrening up the blazing young pitcher (Tim Robbins). Fierce, funny and 
uninhibited, with the famous baseball clown Max Patkin (right) playing himself.

Re the Aug. 5 cover story "Anchored in L.A.": Obviously, KNBC's John Beard, 
Linda Alvarez, Kelly Lange and Keith Morrison haven't the foggiest idea, 
judging by their performances. 
</P>
<P>
John Beard is in dire need of speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot pronounce words properly. The words million, billion and trillion 
come out as miw-yun, biw-yun and triw-yun. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Alvarez has a grin constantly affixed to her face, even when reporting 
terrible tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Lange, after nearly 20 years of punctuating her reports with phrases like 
"Hey, all right!" never seems to know which camera to look at. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Morrison reports the news in a style which is, at best, irritating-at 
worst, very weird. His voice changes pitch so often during the newscast that 
one is reminded of Tiny Tim's rendition of "Tiptoe Through the Tulips." These 
four goofy, grinning stooges make the Channel 4 news a real hoot.

<TEXT>
<P>
On July 30 I had the choice of watching various programs, including "American 
Masters." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that KCET probably would repeat that program, I opted for ABC's "The 
Knife and Gun Club," starring Perry King and Dorian Harewood, and was 
pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
The show was gripping and factual and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just hope that 
it was not an unsold pilot and will never be seen again.

USC KICKS OFF IN GIANTS STADIUM; KCOP AIRS ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While Tennessee and Colorado receive the honor of opening the 1990 college 
football season, USC will be playing in the second game, facing Syracuse in 
Friday's Kickoff Classic at 5 p.m. on KCOP. Phil Stone and Dave Rowe will call 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
NBC sportscaster Don Criqui has been a member of the Kickoff Classic's 
committee since its inception in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"A team's season turns on that first big game," Criqui said. "Teams that have 
come out of the Kickoff Classic with a win have usually gone on to have 
terrific years. But the good team who loses tends to start off on a real down 
note. Either Tennessee or Colorado will be off to a pretty big start in the 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic and the same is true with USC or Syracuse in the 
Kickoff Classic." 
</P>
<P>
The game at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., is USC's first appearance 
in the greater New York City area since a 28-6 win over Army in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans will be getting nearly as much air time as Bart Simpson this 
season, with 11 of their 12 games set for live television. ABC will televise 
games against Penn State (Sept. 15), Ohio State (Sept. 29), Stanford (Oct. 13), 
Arizona State (Oct. 27), UCLA (Nov. 17) and Notre Dame (Nov. 24). Prime Ticket 
will carry games against Washington (Sept. 22), Arizona (Oct. 20) and Cal (Nov. 
3.) ESPN will broadcast the Oct. 6 Washington State game. Only the Nov. 10 game 
against Oregon State is not scheduled for a live broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
What about UCLA? The Bruins will have at least seven of their 11 games on live 
television, beginning with their Sept. 8 opener against Oklahoma. ABC will 
provide coverage beginning at 12:30 p.m. ABC also will carry the Sept. 22 
Michigan game and Nov. 17 USC game. Prime Ticket has scheduled UCLA's games 
against Stanford (Sept. 15), San Diego State (Oct. 13) and Oregon State (Oct. 
27), while ESPN will broadcast the Washington State game Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Other games could be added depending on their importance. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket will air tapes of all USC and UCLA games. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's lone television appearance will come on Sept. 29 when 
SportsChannel carries the Titans Big West Conference game at Fresno State.

TRYING TO CHANGE SOUTH AFRICA WITH POWER OF WRITTEN WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Kraft, Scott Kraft is The Times' bureau chief in Johannesburg. He 
interviewed the author in her home. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 40 years since the white Parliament passed the infamous laws 
creating "grand apartheid." During that same year, the New Yorker published a 
short story by an unknown 26-year-old South African. 
</P>
<P>
That story launched a writing career that has reached a vast international 
reading audience, angered successive white South African governments and earned 
the author regular mention as a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize for 
Literature. 
</P>
<P>
Through a body of work that includes such novels as "Burger's Daughter" and 
"July's People," and the short-story collection "Six Feet of the Country," 
Nadine Gordimer has painted a subtle, yet powerful portrait of the effect of 
apartheid on the people who live in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer, 66, still writes regularly on her manual Hermes typewriter, working 
in a study of the suburban Johannesburg home she shares with her husband, an 
art gallery owner. Her 17th book, a novel called "My Son's Story," is due out 
this fall. She spends more time these days encouraging young artists through 
the Congress of South African Writers, a mostly black organization of 5,000 
writers that she co-founded in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She is a small, gray-haired woman, only 5 foot 1 and 90 pounds, and a picture 
of solemn concentration as she talks about her work and her life, even as the 
family German pointer snores peacefully at her side. Playwright Athol Fugard 
calls her "fiercely uncompromising, uncomfortably uncompromising for a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Her country has changed radically in a matter of months this year and, for the 
first time, Gordimer says she has begun to feel more at home in this nation 
that has been her lifelong home. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress is legal again, after 30 years of waging a 
guerrilla war from exile. Nelson Mandela, the man Gordimer considers her 
political leader, is free and meets with President Frederik W. de Klerk. And 
hardly a week goes by that Gordimer doesn't greet an old friend who has 
returned from exile to rejoin the legal political process. 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer joined the ANC the other day with her usual sense of quiet purpose. 
She walked into a building near downtown Johannesburg, feeling a special warmth 
in the rooms where she and her friends once met secretly. Then she filled out a 
single-page form, pulled 12 rand (about $5) from her pocketbook and became a 
card-carrying member. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of simple scene that she might have used for one of her own 
characters: the life-affirming act of a novelist who sees the future of which 
she dreamed coming true. 
</P>
<P>
"I had waited a very long time. It was really quite moving," Gordimer said the 
next day. "I had been in and out of that office for years. It was such a nice, 
familiar place for this kind of commitment to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Question: Must a writer in South Africa today be politically active? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I'm not by nature a political person at all. In the early '60s, I 
couldn't even get up on a platform and express an opinion about literature . . 
. . I was petrified. And I think if I had lived in another country, I would 
have remained like that . . . . 
</P>
<P>
My whole lifetime here, there has been this enormous struggle coming toward the 
climax it reached in the past decade or so. And to stand aside from that and 
say, "No, I'm not going to pass an opinion on detentions. I'm not going to take 
part in any type of protest against what happens here. I'm not going to speak 
about anything." Whether this is out of reticence or out of fear of the danger, 
I don't think you can work here. I don't think you have a right to. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the burden of a white person, and particularly a white artist, in 
South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you're a writer, you really need to be left alone. So the burden is that 
you really can't be left alone. Whatever you do here, even if you just belong 
to a writers' organization, it's all intensely politicized because culture is 
intensely politicized . . . . It is a burden. I feel ashamed saying so, because 
then you look at other people who really sacrifice all kinds of personal 
fulfillment in order to bring about change. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is art itself a way to bring about change then? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a delicate matter. All literature is . . . trying to make sense of 
life . . . . And if there's any honesty in a writer at all, any self-searching 
in your society, it's going to be a (social) critique . . . . 
</P>
<P>
You get involved in your society. You cannot just be a writer. You have to be a 
citizen as well. But I think it's terribly important not to become a 
propagandist, even for the cause that you believe in most. If you're going to 
produce anything worthwhile, you must retain the freedom to write about that 
society, warts and all . . . . 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean you have to say you have . . . an "evenhanded" approach. I 
don't think, in a society like ours, if you're honest and have any moral sense 
at all or any decency, you can look at apartheid . . . in an evenhanded way. If 
there's anything I am absolutely sure about in my life, it is that racism is 
evil . . . . Nobody can defend it. It's pure evil. Therefore, how can you have 
an evenhanded view of people who practice racism against those who try to 
abolish it. So I think you keep your principles -- more than your principles, 
you keep your strong passionate convictions -- about what is wrong. But in your 
writing you must be free to show that even those who have passionate 
convictions have human faults. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have writers had any influence on South African society? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think South African fiction writers have had some influence . . . . But 
one must be modest about it. In how many countries do writers have any real 
influence? You now have this extraordinary happening in that (Vaclav) Havel is 
president of a country. But . . . it's very rare. In most countries, 
intellectuals have no influence whatever on governments . . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think we have helped in the struggle to the extent that we have been able to 
express the unspoken resentments, frustrations, fears, hates, loves of South 
Africans, who because of the kind of climate of intimidation here have feared 
to say these things openly . . . . 
</P>
<P>
And maybe some whites have been stirred by our writings to examine their own 
lives and have doubts about the way they've been acting. But . . . it's a small 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
But abroad, I think we have done quite a lot, because . . . in scenes of 
violence on a TV screen or in a newspaper report, people's lives are shown at 
that point. You don't know what happened before or what goes on afterward. 
Whereas in a novel, in stories, you have a deeper view of people's lives. You 
see what happened after the riot, what happened after they went home, what 
happened to the parents when the child fled the country, went to Swaziland and 
they didn't hear of their child for two or three years . . . . All these things 
are the result of apartheid and what it does to people here. But you can't see 
them in a newscast. 
</P>
<P>
So I think those of us who are read overseas have really had the opportunity to 
show the people more of a totality of what apartheid means in human terms. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's your feeling about the changes occurring inside South Africa today? 
What do they mean for blacks in South Africa and why are they, as many say, not 
enough? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course they're not enough. Now, one cannot say that the unbanning of the 
liberation movements is insignificant. It was an enormous thing. I heard about 
it . . . . I'll never forget the morning. . . . My two comrades in COSAW 
(Congress of South African Writers) and I had been out . . . in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
. . . . We went to the room where Raks Seakgwa (COSAW regional organizer) 
lives. He has an enormous TV, which I haven't got. So we sat in his room there 
and watched . . . the speech. It was extraordinary because Raks spent five 
years on Robben Island (prison). And the other young man, . . . as recently as 
1988, spent a year in solitary confinement in detention. And they're such 
extraordinary young men because they seemed to have no bitterness; they 
accepted it as their part in the struggle for freedom . . . . 
</P>
<P>
So . . . to hear the unbanning of the ANC . . . was for me extraordinary -- and 
very humbling. They were absolutely bowled over. They couldn't believe it. So 
you can't say that this is nothing. 
</P>
<P>
(But) now all the awful things are happening. You see (President Frederik W.) 
de Klerk maneuvering toward a new dispensation here with, from the point of 
view of many white people, the most extraordinary concessions to black majority 
rule. But I don't think they quite realized what this would bring about, 
because it's brought about the resurgence of white Afrikaner fanaticism, racist 
fanaticism . . . . (This is) something that dampens one's euphoria . . . . 
</P>
<P>
But to look on the good side, the level at which Nelson Mandela and his group 
have been received in the outside world is something that, of course, should 
have happened long, long ago. When you think how many years the ANC was totally 
ignored by the West, I think it's terribly important that the West should give 
full support to Mandela and the ANC . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: How has Mandela changed the attitudes of whites? 
</P>
<P>
A: There's something about the charisma of Mandela. Everybody fell in love with 
Mandela. (They said:) "If we have to have a black man, let it be Mandela." But 
what they have to realize is what he's said time and time again -- that he's 
not a savior standing alone. If you accept Mandela and respect Mandela, then 
you must accept the African National Congress . . . whether you like it or not. 
And I think that's a move that still has to be made among whites. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What were your feelings about joining the ANC? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's the first time in my life I've ever belonged to a political party. I 
think it's very important that whites who subscribe to the idea of a non-racial 
future for South Africa should become signed-up members of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think De Klerk is serious about reform? 
</P>
<P>
A: His record isn't very good. He was on the right wing of the Botha 
government. But I think he's a very intelligent man. He's proving that every 
day. You listen to his speeches and you see how he deals with things. He's 
highly intelligent, and he seems to be a worldly man. And God knows we haven't 
seen many worldly men among the Afrikaner presidents. 
</P>
<P>
I think he's just seen what I like to call the forces of history . . . . I 
think he's realized that this country cannot carry on the way it was. Of 
course, they will try desperately to hang onto (giving) whites . . . the final 
word in everything, and this is something we have to push against all the time 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the suggestion that there are political divisions among blacks in South 
Africa, and even within the ANC, worry you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why should the world expect there to be absolute unity in the black 
population? Where else is there? . . . . It will be the same as it is 
everywhere else in the world. There's no unity in the Labor Party in Britain, 
no real unity among the Republicans or among the Democrats in the United 
States. And obviously if you're going to have a multiparty democracy, you're 
going to have that here . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some artists worry that the ANC is not committed to freedom of expression. 
What will happen to artistic freedom under a black-ruled government in South 
Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: No one can guarantee anything. Are we going to have a ministry of culture? 
In one way, I want that, because it could encourage young artists. If you have 
a ministry of culture, then there's government money to spend on the arts. But 
one always fears if you have a ministry of culture then decisions about what is 
culture will be made at the ministerial level. 
</P>
<P>
The general feeling, in the ANC and elsewhere, is that we've had enough of 
censorship and want to have complete freedom in the arts and freedom to 
re-examine anything in our own lives and our own society -- anything at all . . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think the future holds for South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm inclined to be optimistic, based on a lifetime of knowledge of the 
character of blacks in South Africa . . . . But through all the terrible years 
of the struggle and the repression, so many terrible things have happened. 
</P>
<P>
I think it distorts people's character. It certainly brought about a tolerance 
of violence, and a feeling that violence is part of our ordinary lives. It's a 
danger . . . . There are these constant distortions of people's normal feelings 
and reactions . . . . There seems to be no end to the horrors that this policy 
can bring about. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are so many encouraging signs within this awful 
matrix. So many people -- black and white -- working together . . . . These 
things are happening, but they tend to be overshadowed by the horrors. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For you, how is life today different from a year ago or even 30 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . . I really feel -- and this is truly a novelty in my adult life -- 
that there is something I can openly identify with. I feel so grateful that I'm 
still here. That at least I've stayed to see the changes that have come about. 
</P>
<P>
I must keep reminding myself that in terms of the law, almost nothing has 
happened. But the fact is the liberation movements have been unbanned, the fact 
is that Mandela and the others are now people whose opinions matter a great 
deal in national life, at all levels . . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult for Americans to understand how you could live your whole life 
without belonging to a political structure, without saying I'm a Democrat or 
I'm a Republican. Truly, people like myself have always felt that there was 
nothing here we could officially belong to. You were always on the side of the 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How have the distortions brought on by apartheid been reflected in your art, 
and in the art of South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: It has provided a tremendous pressure, obviously. But it's in the nature of 
art to resist those pressures. This is true of everybody who practices in the 
arts in this country. It doesn't really matter whether they are black or white 
or what they are. The distortions are there (but) I think that art exposes 
them. If art doesn't expose them, if it just gives in to them, then it loses 
its validity as art.

ALTADENA'S LEGENDARY JIRAYR ZORTHIAN SCULPTS LIFE, LAND TO HIS OWN DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an instant, Jirayr Zorthian scampered up a narrow iron ladder on a retaining 
wall at his Altadena ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortcut," he explained as he toured his rambling, dust-covered spread in the 
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
From this vantage point, the painter-sculptor-craftsman-eccentric scanned a 
landscape heaped with junk: a full-sized telephone booth, heavy-equipment 
tires, river rocks, rusty metal slats and broken concrete -- all grist for the 
Zorthian artistic mill. 
</P>
<P>
To him, everything is a work in progress. "I have 40 more years of work," 
Zorthian said. "I'm 79 now. So 40 years from now. . . ." He paused for 
emphasis. "I'll be 119." Then, true to his feisty spirit, he said: "I don't 
have time to die." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the Zorthian art ranch makes clear that he has no intention of 
relinquishing any of his roles -- as rattlesnake handler, horse breeder, 
architect, painter, winemaker, hog butcher, lover of life and raconteur 
extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people my age have given up being curious or vital," he said the 
other day. "Can you imagine me in a retirement home playing shuffleboard?" 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-3 Zorthian's muscles are rock hard, although his sun-weathered, 
tawny skin sags. 
</P>
<P>
Shirtless and in shorts, he walked the ups and downs and sideways of his ranch, 
45 acres of chaparral perched 2,000 feet above sea level, with the rest of 
Altadena and Pasadena covered in smog below. 
</P>
<P>
This place -- rich in textures, shapes and smells -- has been his home since he 
left the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although by no means a famous artist, the Yale-educated painter has exhibited 
around the country and the world. As a teacher and mentor, he has inspired 
many. And in Pasadena art circles, his reputation for eccentricity has grown to 
mythic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to these boring, liberal parties and there he is having a great time, 
wearing a hand-tooled leather top hat and colorful vests," said Pasadena arts 
activist Dorothy Garcia. "He's like a half-man, half-horse, a centaur with Pan 
influences, dancing on tables. He's sort of a mountain Toulouse-Lautrec." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, during the sweltering heat of a party staged by the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, Zorthian complained that no one got up to dance with him and 
his wife, Dabney, 56, a tall woman with elegant bearing and a head of 
luxuriously long, graying hair. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter with these young people?" Zorthian said, cane in hand. "I've 
got a broken leg -- I fell off my horse -- and all these beautiful young people 
with strong legs aren't dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Zorthian the dancer gained fame in the best-selling book "Surely You're Joking, 
Mr. Feynman!" 
</P>
<P>
The author, the late Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at 
Caltech, recounted how Zorthian, taken by Feynman's bongo-drum playing at a 
party, ran into the bathroom and sprayed designs in shaving cream on his hairy 
chest. When he returned, Zorthian had cherries hanging from his ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally this crazy nut and I became good friends right away," Feynman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The physicist, who died in 1988, detailed how he and Zorthian exchanged lessons 
in physics and art, and also sketched the same Playboy models. 
</P>
<P>
Decades after the bongo-inspired dance, Zorthian is still exploring his own 
laws of physics and art. 
</P>
<P>
He is known for hosting exotic banquets with a robust blend of intellectuals, 
scientists, movie stars and artists in attendance. Pilgrims such as actor 
Burgess Meredith, futurist R. Buckminster Fuller, Bob Hope's wife, Dolores, and 
comedian Cheech Marin have journeyed up the dusty switchbacks to see the 
ranch's wonders. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who relishes Zorthian's feasts is Albert R. Hibbs, now retired 
after years of prominence as a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist. He said: 
"(Zorthian) is often a little bit crazy, but in such a pleasant way." 
</P>
<P>
He is a lavish yarn spinner. His tales can be ribald or shockingly painful, as 
in the case of stories from his Turkish Armenian boyhood, when he witnessed 
wholesale killings. 
</P>
<P>
Zorthian, twice married, is reluctant to speak of certain family tragedies. Two 
of his seven children died. 
</P>
<P>
But he thrives on explaining his bodily wounds. Every scar tells a story. 
</P>
<P>
One on his elbow involved 80 stitches and looks as if it came from a broken 
bottle in a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zorthian: "I developed a sport called boar riding. You get on a 400- to 
500-pound pig. You hold onto it behind the ears. If you stay on 75 feet, you're 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, he teetered near death from a rattlesnake bite. He had 
tried to catch the snake -- barehanded. Two years ago, he broke his leg 
training a horse. Recently he underwent a hip-replacement operation related to 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was successful, giving him new vitality. Now, he said, he can 
complete many languishing projects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, William Agee, then the director of the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art 
(later taken over by the Norton Simon Museum), said Zorthian's "entire ranch is 
a living work of art. . . . The distinction between architecture and art is 
difficult to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Proudly, Zorthian said: "This entire property has sort of been sculpted with a 
skip-loader." 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, part art and part function, takes various forms. The most famous 
are his walls, which curb erosion on the mountainside and embody his visions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a controlled artistic situation," Zorthian said, pointing to his 
favorite wall, taller than he is and sloping with the earth's contour. 
</P>
<P>
Encased amid the mortar and stone are a shovel, a piece of a tree that shaded 
Zorthian's studio with bright yellow flowers before it died, and a baby doll 
with a hair-loss problem (Lady Godiva, he explained) on a ceramic horse. 
</P>
<P>
Another totem contains a series of metal strips behind a rusted radiator. On 
each strip is inscribed Zorthian's version of the seven deadly sins: 
"Judgmental. Indulgence. Vanity. Anger. Anxiety. Procrastination. Gluttony." 
</P>
<P>
The last of these, Zorthian said, he conquered by losing 12 pounds. The others, 
he said, he is still working on. 
</P>
<P>
"This keeps me from going to the head-shrinker. I solve my own problems," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From somewhere came the wham-bang! of a dump truck unloading broken concrete -- 
bounty for more projects. A rooster crowed. The heat of the day heightened the 
barnyard smells. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend of the Zorthians, Kilbee Brittain of Los Angeles, said: "He's 
the only person I know who could build a wall with a skull of a pig, a 
telephone and toilet bowls -- all in perfect symmetry." 
</P>
<P>
Zorthian, explaining that friends bring gifts of junk, said: "Everybody knows 
what I need." 
</P>
<P>
He rang a hammer on an anvil and told how for $105 he got a slew of 
blacksmith's tools. Moving on, he pointed with pride to other treasures: a 
phone booth affixed with a "Find it fast in the yellow pages" sign, and enough 
red stop signs to control traffic in a small town. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Zorthian said, he hopes to finish his decades-in-production, three-story, 
creosote-colored barn/house made of telephone poles. Scores of bottle-glass 
electrical insulators stud the outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dabney live in a stone farmhouse, chockablock with artifacts and art, 
including the governor of Tennessee's 1987 declaration that Zorthian is a 
"Tennessee Colonel" because of the mural he painted in 1938 in the state 
capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the property, he leases out what he calls a "$600,000 rich man's 
house." There are many other structures, including an unfinished guest house 
with an elaborate doorway and a tepee erected by American Indian friends. 
</P>
<P>
There are terraces, kinetic art, horses, beehives and piles of tires. 
</P>
<P>
Automobiles and trucks, many of them faded and in disrepair, dot the landscape. 
A lime-green 1957 Cadillac with two flat tires has a vanity plate reading 
ZORTH. A boom truck is next to a milk truck he and Dabney used for 24 years for 
their Zorthians' Day Ranch for Children. 
</P>
<P>
There is a black-and-white, snub-nosed Los Angeles County police bus; a 
Volkswagen van; an MG sports car and an ample supply of small trailers and 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
One notable attraction is buried behind a wall of rusting items. It's an 
elephant Zorthian made for a 1959 exhibit at the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art, 
constructed from a fire hose, buckets, burlap and rope. Inside the animal's 
stomach is a papier-mache missionary's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this in 1959, long before Kienholtz and the others were doing this kind 
of art and selling it for a fortune," he said, referring to Edward Kienholtz, 
whose assemblage piece "Back Seat Dodge '38" is part of the Los Angeles County 
Museum's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
As Zorthian walked through his bunker-like slaughterhouse and its environs, he 
spoke of what is: "This is where we make our own ham. This is where we make our 
own sausages." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the slaughterhouse, under the shade of live oaks, he spoke of what will 
be: "There'll be a 150-by-50-foot lake with boats, swans, canoes." 
</P>
<P>
At another site, he said, "we'll have cages of wild animals, trained for the 
movie business. We'll have a bear, a wolf, a tiger." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the farmhouse over a lunch of lahmajoon (Armenian pizza topped with lamb 
paste), black olives, feta cheese and wine, he spoke of his Armenian childhood: 
"I saw people beheaded right in front of me. I saw people hanging from 
telephone poles. I saw terrible massacres." 
</P>
<P>
One day, Zorthian said, his father was led away to be executed. The family 
heard nothing more. Three years later, his father reappeared to tell of a 
miraculous escape. 
</P>
<P>
Zorthian ate an olive down to the pit. He threw the pit with a true aim. It 
sailed into the fireplace, between the screen and the smoke-stained mantel. 
</P>
<P>
He changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, he surveyed his domain of unfinished projects and quoted an old 
saying: " 'Art is long but life is short.' You can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Come back in 20 years and you'll really see something."

JUNK BONDS ARE NOW OUT, AND TED FORSTMANN IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occupying a prominent spot in Theodore Forstmann's office, right next to the 
picture of him with George Bush, is a joke gift that the corporate buyout 
specialist received recently at his 50th birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phony newspaper advertisement in a silver frame. Printed to look like 
the quarter-page "tombstone" ads that financial companies take out to trumpet 
completion of big deals, it says: 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to announce the acquisition of the remaining assets of Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., debtor in possession. $57,894. Forstmann, Little 
&amp; Co." 
</P>
<P>
The term "debtor in possession" denotes a company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the company that Forstmann 
regards as his archrival, isn't in bankruptcy, of course. Its assets are 
several orders of magnitude above $57,894. And it's likely that hell will 
freeze over before Forstmann Little acquires KKR. 
</P>
<P>
But the gag gift, and its place of honor in Forstmann's office, hints at a new 
sense of optimism and vindication -- if not vindictiveness -- at the buyout 
firm that he heads, Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann is the man who refused to use junk bonds. Although a pioneer of 
leveraged buyouts, in the late 1980s he lost out on deal after deal to KKR and 
other firms because he wouldn't resort to what he scornfully called "wampum" 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, while he railed publicly against Drexel Burnham Lambert; 
its junk bond king, Michael Milken, and KKR -- all integral parts of the junk 
bond mega-machine that time and again outbid him -- his firm didn't complete a 
single deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbarians at the Gate," the recent best-selling book about the battle for RJR 
Nabisco in 1988, portrayed Forstmann as an almost comical figure. While he 
fussed and fumed about the evils of junk bonds, others got the big deals done. 
</P>
<P>
Now Forstmann is having the last laugh. Since the first of the year, he has 
completed two buyouts. Just this week, he wrapped up the acquisition of General 
Instrument Corp., a maker of equipment for cable television, for $1.6 billion. 
In February, he acquired Gulfstream Aerospace, the corporate jet manufacturer, 
from Chrysler Corp. for $825 million. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing buyouts at a time when almost no one else is able to. 
</P>
<P>
And his consternation at the junk bond wizards, it now appears, wasn't just 
sour grapes. Milken awaits sentencing on felony securities fraud charges. 
Drexel has collapsed. Companies that were 1980s junk bond success stories have, 
under the weight of their debt, become 1990s disasters. Other leveraged buyout 
firms, such as Coniston Partners, have disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the carnage, Forstmann stands unscathed. He is again taken very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a very, very strong position relative to other financial buyers," 
Forstmann says in an interview. With most of the other big players of the 1980s 
on the sidelines or out of business, investment bankers are turning to 
Forstmann Little with a long list of proposed deals. 
</P>
<P>
Although his remaining war chest is only about $1.4 billion, he is expected to 
start raising money soon for a new fund of at least $2 billion. Constrained by 
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that prohibit announcement of 
new investment funds before disclosure documents are filed with the government, 
Forstmann refuses to discuss his fund-raising plans. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that Forstmann Little may soon make more acquisitions. 
"We're looking at other things" to follow the General Instruments deal, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann talks with a reporter in his corner office on the 44th floor of the 
General Motors building, overlooking much of Manhattan. As befits a leading 
Republican fund-raiser and head of a major financial enterprise, he is dressed 
conservatively in a gray suit and dark tie. But, at 50, he retains a boyish 
air, with hair a little longer than fashionable. His collar is unbuttoned, and 
he sits with one leg draped comfortably over the arm of an overstuffed 
upholstered chair. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann is pleased not only about the two buyouts announced this year but 
also about the hefty profit on the sale of assets acquired in previous buyouts. 
His firm last week completed the sale of Moen Group Inc., a faucet maker, to 
American Brands for $975 million. Forstmann Little had acquired Moen as part of 
Stanadyne Inc., a faucet, auto-products and instrument manufacturer it bought 
in 1988 for $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, combined with proceeds from sales of other Stanadyne assets, brings a 
profit of more than 600% for the equity investors in the Forstmann Little deal. 
"That's winning," Forstmann says. "That means you were right about everything. 
You didn't pay too much; you were right about the company." 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann is so pleased with the way things are going that he is giving more 
attention to the non-business side of his life. Long a denizen of a big 
apartment in Manhattan overlooking the East River, he recently bought a house 
at the top of Coldwater Canyon in Los Angeles. Beginning this winter, he plans 
to spend most of his time in Southern California, although the firm will remain 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
An exceptional tennis player who often beats young pros, Forstmann had a tennis 
court built on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"The New York life is hard for me," says Forstmann, whose net worth is 
estimated at several hundred million dollars. He says he prefers occupying his 
own house to living in an apartment. He believes that spending most of his time 
in Los Angeles will allow him more regularly to put in what he considers ideal 
working hours: "The perfect day would be to work until 3 or 4, play tennis, 
then have a barbecue. None of that you can do in New York." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the size of this year's Forstmann Little deals is modest next to 
the late-1980s mega-deals -- such as RJR, the biggest, which went to KKR for 
$25 billion. Forstmann, however, says purchasers paid absurd prices then, 
backed by the most suspect type of junk bonds, such as "payment-in-kind" 
securities that don't even pay cash interest until maturity. Acquisitions, he 
contends, can now be made at more realistic prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although Forstmann is in a buoyant mood these days, not quite everything is 
coming up roses. In March, he had to abandon plans for a new fund that would 
invest in and reorganize companies that had gotten into trouble from too much 
debt. His small stable of big investors balked, in part because they didn't 
want to be associated with troubled companies, in part because they noted that 
Forstmann still had a considerable amount of their money sitting idly in his 
other funds. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann declines to make a specific prediction about how the RJR Nabisco deal 
will turn out for KKR. But he says that at the steep price KKR paid, the 
potential return didn't seem to justify the amount of risk involved. The true 
test, he says, should be the size of the ultimate return -- not whether an 
acquired company merely manages to stave off bankruptcy. Forstmann's brother 
Nick, also a general partner in the firm, is more explicit. He notes that 
tobacco was one big part of RJR's business, and he says tobacco assets in 
general have declined steeply in value since the deal. "They overpaid for the 
whole bundle of assets, and one major part of that bundle is becoming less 
valuable in the marketplace," Nick says. 
</P>
<P>
A KKR spokesman says it's far too early to assess the ultimate success of the 
RJR deal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Forstmann Little's track record has been excellent, that firm is also 
feeling the effects of a general tightening of bank credit, sparked by high 
loan losses and intense pressure from regulators. Secured bank loans are an 
essential part of buyout financing. Although the firm got loans for its two 
deals this year, Forstmann's brother Nick, a general partner in the firm and 
the one who deals most with the banks, acknowledges that such money is harder 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
"In our specific situation, the banks are certainly more cautious," Nick 
Forstmann says. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Forstmann, the senior partner and most visible member of the firm, is 
renowned for his "spiel," his repetitive condemnation of junk bonds, excessive 
debt and excessive fees charged by rival buyout firms and investment banks. 
During the interview, parts of the spiel kept popping out: 
</P>
<P>
The explosion of junk bonds was "the Pandora's Box event. . . . Credit became 
-- and you can hardly call it credit -- but this wampum became so available, 
anybody could raise it for any reason at all, to take over anything. . . . What 
happened in this euphoric period of time was a good deal was a deal that didn't 
go bankrupt in a month." 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann has never wavered in the gist of this spiel. He has also lived by it, 
even in the lean times, giving the impression that he has nerves of steel. But 
he admits now that he was wracked by doubts. And, at the worst moments, at the 
height of the junk bond frenzy, he even thought of the unthinkable -- resorting 
to junk bonds himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some real internal personal battles with myself," he says, adding that 
at the worst moments he wondered: "Have I gotten blindsided somehow? Am I 
wrong?" He adds, bitterly, "Everyone seemed to be on this bandwagon -- the 
press included." 
</P>
<P>
With $2.7 billion in investors' money sitting idly in his fund, and fearful 
that investors and even his own partners might grow restive, Forstmann summoned 
his brother Nick and the four other Forstmann Little general partners to a 
dinner meeting. He asked if they thought that he was on the wrong track, 
whether Forstmann Little should relent and try to do junk-financed deals. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it up with these guys, and they were terrific, they were very 
supportive, and they said, 'You know, we think you're right. It's not easy, but 
we think you're right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann Little is a small firm. It has only six general partners and a staff 
of fewer than 20, not counting employees of the companies it acquires. By 
choice, it also has a small stable of investors. They include "16 to 20 
institutions," Forstmann says, and about 20 individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann says he prefers dealing with the same loyal group rather than 
drumming up new sources of money. In any event, his investors have deep 
pockets: In addition to state pension funds, they include corporate giants such 
as General Electric, IBM and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Carroll, president of the GTE Investment Management Corp., acknowledges 
that investors were beginning to lean on Forstmann to do something with the 
money. But, he says, it is clear now that many of the deals done then were 
grossly overpriced. Forstmann was right to hold back. "He didn't buckle under 
the pressure," Carroll says. 
</P>
<P>
And investors are pleased. "His track record speaks for itself," says John H. 
Myers, executive vice president of General Electric Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was formed in 1978, Forstmann Little has done 16 buyouts (counting 
General Instruments), for a total of nearly $10 billion. During the past 12 
years, the average annual return to equity investors has been a whopping 85%, 
while debt investors received a healthy 30%. Forstmann emphasizes that the 85% 
figure is after Forstmann Little's share of the profits is subtracted. 
</P>
<P>
The key difference in Forstmann Little's financing of buyouts, compared to most 
other buyout specialists in the 1980s, was the way it raised "mezzanine" 
financing -- the layer of subordinated debt sandwiched between the money put up 
to buy equity, and secured bank loans. KKR and others used junk bonds -- 
high-risk, high-yield securities -- to raise that middle layer of financing. 
But Forstmann raised his subordinated debt without bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he relied directly on his big investors. They invested in his 
Subordinated Debt and Equity Fund. In exchange for loaning money for the 
buyouts at a relatively modest interest rate, they got about one-third of the 
equity in the deals, bringing a big overall return. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other large deals that the firm carried out were the acquisition, and 
later sale, of Dr Pepper Co., Topps Chewing Gum and Lear Siegler Inc., a 
diversified manufacturer. The firm owns and manages Lear Siegler and other big 
companies, including Safelite. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann doesn't gloat about what happened to Milken and Drexel. But he 
contends that Drexel was a house of cards, and he is irate that the firm's 
pre-eminence was allowed to continue so long. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the junk bond market last year has left Forstmann virtually 
alone among financial companies doing buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Securities Data, leveraged buyouts in the first half of 1990 were 
off more than 95% from the same period in 1989, in terms of dollar value of 
deals. But Forstmann probably won't be alone for long. With stock prices 
tumbling, companies may again become inviting acquisition targets. Some big 
financiers already have announced plans to get back into the buyout business. 
</P>
<P>
William Simon, the former U.S. Treasury secretary who brought LBOs to the 
world's attention in the early 1980s, when he made a stunning profit on his 
buyout of Gibson Greeting Cards, says he's getting back into buyouts after 
sitting on the sidelines for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann is famous in particular for his enmity for KKR -- an attitude 
highlighted in the "Barbarians" book. KKR was the victor in the battle for RJR 
Nabisco, winning the company with a junk bond-backed bid of $25 billion, or 
$109 a share, a price Forstmann says was ridiculously high. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to getting RJR Nabisco, LBO leader KKR's numerous earlier buyouts 
included Beatrice Foods, the consumer-products company; Storer Communications, 
a big broadcaster, and Safeway. On the advice of a public relations consultant, 
Forstmann struggles now to tone down his criticism of KKR. Asked if he would 
care to make a prediction about what will become of that firm in the next few 
years, he declines. 
</P>
<P>
"Would I care to? Yes. Am I going to? No." He laughs. "I've learned." 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes later, he can't resist accusing KKR of inflating figures on 
returns to its investors. KKR's published figures are "fantasy returns," he 
asserts, because they don't first subtract the cut they keep for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that KKR is giving its equity investors a real return of only about 
20% or 25% per year, compared to Forstmann Little's 85%. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, KKR principals Henry Kravis and George Roberts declined to 
be interviewed for this article. But the spokesman, Tom Daly, confirmed that 
the published 38% annual rate of return on the recent sale of the Motel 6 chain 
and 50% annual return on the sale of Beatrice assets is before KKR's cut is 
taken. He declined to say how big that cut is, but industry sources say it's 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Daly maintained that KKR has given investors an excellent overall 
return on investments. And, without being specific, he challenged the accuracy 
of some of Forstmann's claimed profits. As to the health of KKR, he says, "The 
firm is doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Grant, editor of a Wall Street newsletter called Grant's Interest Rate 
Observer and a friend of Forstmann, says, "I would love to be washed up the way 
Henry Kravis is washed up." It was Grant, in fact, who gave the KKR joke ad to 
Forstmann. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Forstmann's own loyal investors also invest with KKR. Edward V. Regan, 
the New York State comptroller who is in charge of investing state pension fund 
money, has invested in both. In a telephone interview, Regan said he hasn't 
done a detailed comparison of returns. But "our experience has been (that) with 
all of the partnerships we're in . . . we've done very well." 
</P>
<P>
Brother Nick says the rivalry with KKR in part reflects Ted's competitive 
spirit. Always a highly competitive athlete, Ted Forstmann is an avid skier, 
golfer and, in his school days at Yale, an ice hockey goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Nick, 43, recalls his big brother playing in the 1961 Harvard-Yale hockey game: 
</P>
<P>
"Yale didn't have all that great a hockey team. Harvard did. He rose to the 
occasion, made 50 or 60 saves in the game, and they tied it. He rises to the 
occasion." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a musical side to Forstmann. He is an accomplished piano player 
and at his birthday party got to accompany one of his favorite groups, the 
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 
</P>
<P>
He is a strong supporter of Jack Kemp, the U.S. Secretary for Housing and Urban 
Development. When Kemp failed to show enough strength to win the 1988 
Republican presidential nomination, Forstmann helped bankroll the Bush-Quayle 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been involved in charitable activities, including a center for 
children with learning disabilities and education programs run by the Catholic 
Archdiocese of New York. He was a Big Brother for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Among his more exotic charitable activities was the financing a group of Afghan 
rebels in the 1980s. He says the idea was first brought up by a tablemate at a 
White House luncheon, and he soon received a visit from an Afghan rebel 
general. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to work something like the Save the Children program, only instead of 
adopting a Third World child Forstmann got to choose one of the rebel leaders 
and adopt his troop. He supplied money for basic necessities such as food and 
clothing. "I got letters from the guy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann is single and declines to reveal much about his steady girlfriend of 
five years. All he'll say is that she's from Louisiana, is athletic and is "the 
antithesis of a New York society lady." 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly pleased with the way things are turning out now, Forstmann is 
eager not to appear smug. Reflecting on the junk bond years, he says, "I am 
just sorry that so much damage was done." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, he says, his firm probably wouldn't even have been offered the 
General Instrument deal. He says the investment bank that introduced Forstmann 
Little to General Instrument probably wouldn't even have bothered a year or two 
ago, because any deal almost certainly would have been topped by another firm 
backed by junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann reflects, "It is frustrating if there's a company that you'd really 
like to own, and you can't even get into the auction, and you have all the 
money and none of the other guys have any (real) money at all."

<P>
Scenes from a disaster: 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, his dark eyes seemingly sunk deeper than usual, jumps into his 
brown four-wheel-drive vehicle and drives off into the night. He has lost his 
fifth U.S. Open final, this one in four sets -- two of them tiebreakers -- to 
Boris Becker. Lendl sheds little light on his misfortune. "It's quite 
unbelievable," he says. "I don't know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's been nearly a year since Lendl, tennis' most haunted, sent gravel flying 
on his hasty escape from the National Tennis Center. This brings us to one 
truth: About the only thing Lendl does faster than drive is conduct postmatch 
news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
This year at Wimbledon, where he failed to win for the 11th time, he opened one 
meeting with the media this way: "Start asking questions, you've got nine 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was just as well. Maybe, as at last year's U.S. Open, Lendl didn't 
quite know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
Look at what has happened to him in the year since. It's been like an Ivan the 
Terrible tour. He lost to Becker in the final at Stuttgart, West Germany; lost 
to Emilio Sanchez in the fourth round of the Lipton International Players 
Championship in Key Biscayne, Fla.; lost to Aaron Krickstein in the semifinals 
of the Japan Open. And a week after beating Becker in the final at Queens in 
London, he lost to Stefan Edberg in straight sets at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Edberg revealed the depth of his pity for Lendl. "I mean, I don't 
feel bad at all," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
After Wimbledon, Lendl pulled out of two tournaments, claiming a knee injury. 
He showed up at New Haven, Conn., promptly lost his first match to 83rd-ranked 
MaliVai Washington and dropped to No. 3 in the rankings, behind Edberg and 
Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always disappointing to lose, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Expecting something not quite so tepid? Lendl uses colorful language about as 
often as he comes to the net, which happens only the three weeks he is playing 
at Queens and Wimbledon. With remarkably few exceptions, Lendl's measured 
comments reflect the workmanlike nature of his game. He simply walks out there 
and slugs balls at opponents until their arms feel like sandbags. Nothing 
fancy, nothing extra. Simply hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It's always worked for him, until now. But these are unusual times for Lendl, 
who returns to the U.S. Open, beginning Monday at the National Tennis Center, 
struggling more than he has in nearly a decade. Lendl is third-seeded behind 
No. 1-ranked Edberg and No. 2 Becker. It's the lowest he has been seeded since 
1982, when he was third behind John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, 30, has won one tournament -- Queens -- since the indoor season last 
spring, and, although he did win the year's first Grand Slam event, he didn't 
have to finish the match to do it. Edberg suffered a pulled stomach muscle and 
retired in the third set in the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
So when Lendl walks onto the court to play the U.S. Open, he will be a question 
mark for the first time in years. His confidence isn't exactly shaken, but it 
is stirred. Even Lendl doesn't quite know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"As they always say, if I didn't think I could win, I wouldn't be playing," 
Lendl said. "It's going to be difficult, but I still think I have a chance, 
even though you think I'm an old . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In other professional sports, players are in their prime at 30. But in tennis? 
Consider that McEnroe dropped from No. 4 to No. 21 in the year it took him to 
go from 30 to 31. Edberg, who has won twice at Wimbledon, is only 24, and 
Becker, who has won there three times, is 22. Andre Agassi is 20 and Michael 
Chang is 18. 
</P>
<P>
But Lendl said he is past being concerned with his ranking or with how to win 
the affection of tennis fans who have been reluctant to embrace him. As for the 
U.S. Open, well, he has already won it three times, so what's the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to prove at the Open," Lendl said. "I've won it enough times. 
I've done well enough times. Of course, it would be nice to win it, (but) I 
wouldn't say I'm playing extra hard because of it. I don't think I can play any 
harder than before." 
</P>
<P>
Not harder, but maybe better. Against Becker in last year's final, Lendl forced 
a first-set tiebreaker only to throw away his chances by losing the first five 
points. He routed Becker in the second set, 6-1, but lost the third set. He 
broke Becker's serve but made a key double fault, losing his serve at love and 
blowing a chance to even the set. 
</P>
<P>
Becker and Lendl went into a fourth-set tiebreaker, and Becker took a 5-4 lead 
with the next two points on his serve. There was little Lendl could do. The 
first was an ace, Becker's 11th of the match, and the second -- on match point 
-- was a service winner down the middle that dribbled off Lendl's racket. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had his first Grand Slam title somewhere other than Wimbledon, and Lendl 
had his second consecutive loss in the final. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then. This is now: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Volvo International in New Haven, his first tournament since 
Wimbledon, Lendl isn't quite sure what to expect when he walks on the court to 
face 21-year-old Mal Washington, a pro for 11 months after leaving the 
University of Michigan as a sophomore. Lendl wins only five games and loses in 
straight sets. Washington says he was flustered at first because of playing 
Lendl: "It's a bit difficult during the introductions when they start out, 'On 
the chair's left, winner of 87 tournaments' and then they mention you won some 
college tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl refers to his defeat by Washington as "that bad day in New Haven." 
</P>
<P>
To get ready for the U.S. Open, he played singles in a special event at Forest 
Hills. And, to log some match play, Lendl even played doubles with Henri 
Leconte, which has to be one of the strangest doubles teams in modern times -- 
Lendl, straight as a ruler, teamed with Leconte, a lounge act in sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, stranger things have happened, although one of them is not Lendl 
winning Wimbledon. A year ago, he lost to Becker in the semifinals after going 
ahead by a set and a break, then packed his rackets and charged off the court 
without waiting for Becker or bowing to the Royal Box. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Lendl tried to avoid a similar result. He spent nearly three months 
refining his grass-court game with Coach Tony Roche. Playing on grass does not 
come naturally to Lendl, who hammers ground strokes from the base line. Grass 
court tennis consists of a big serve, a return and a volley. Usually, that's 
all there is to it. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Bellamy, former London Times tennis correspondent, referred to grass-court 
tennis this way: "It is much like a dachshund standing on its hind legs. At 
first it seems remarkable, then it becomes quite boring." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl worked harder than ever with Roche, an Australian grass-court expert. 
Besides the emphasis on volleying, ground strokes require a different 
technique, because the ball bounces so low on the closely cropped grass. Gene 
Scott, a former U.S. Davis Cup player, once described the Wimbledon grass as 
being cut "as close to death as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl even skipped the French Open, much to the relief of eventual champion 
Andres Gomez of Ecuador, who nearly didn't enter until he heard Lendl wouldn't 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I believe I have a chance," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl rejoined the IBM/ATP tour and made his grass-court debut at the Queen's 
Club in London, where he successfully defended his only title on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said he believed Lendl was at the top of his grass court game two weeks 
before with the victory at Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it, he played really well in Queens and maybe he peaked a 
little bit," Edberg said. "I thought, looking at the situations, he's going to 
lose the rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
His face flushed, Lendl bravely answered questions after losing to Edberg. 
Lendl was well aware that his only goal of 1990 -- to win Wimbledon -- would 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
When Edberg won at Cincinnati, Lendl fell to No. 2 in the rankings. When Lendl 
lost to Washington, Lendl fell to No. 3. But it is still Wimbledon, not 
necessarily his ranking, that consumes Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
"To be No. 1, it would be nice," he said. "I said what my priorities were for 
the year, and unfortunately they didn't happen. But right now, I would like to 
win the Open. I feel if you win two Grand Slams, you should be No. 1 -- if 
nobody does the same, anyhow. But I don't really worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
One player who will closely monitor Lendl's play at the Open is Edberg, who 
believes Lendl may be affected by losing Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's got to have an effect on him," Edberg said. "He put so much 
pressure on himself by making Wimbledon his only goal. Maybe he will be able to 
put it out of his mind. I don't know. If he does, it's not going to be easy for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Making money has been a breeze for Lendl. He has won $16.4 million, and that 
doesn't include his appearance fees, guarantees or money from exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
When Forbes magazine listed the top 30 earners in sports for 1990, Lendl 
checked in at $5.3 million. Forbes counted projected tournament winnings, 
appearance and promotional fees, but not income from investments. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl owns his own company, Spectrum Sports, in Greenwich, Conn., and has real 
estate in Florida, Paris and Prague, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He holds a green card that permits him to live in the United States, but hopes 
to be granted citizenship by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage in his life, there is change for Lendl that does not involve his 
career. Married to his longtime girlfriend, Samantha Frankel, he is the father 
of a 3-month-old daughter, Marika. The Lendls live in a 20-room Georgian 
mansion in Greenwich, a house made of stone behind a chain-link fence. It is a 
long way from Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, an only child, was born in the coal-mining city of Ostrava, in northern 
Czechoslovakia near the Polish border. Ostrava is sometimes called "the black 
city" because of all the coal soot from the smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's lawyer father, Jiri, was once ranked among the top 15 tennis players in 
the country. Olga Jenistova Lendlova, Lendl's mother, is a secretary and was 
once ranked No. 2 in Czechoslovakia in singles. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Lendl was 3, Olga began taking him along to her daily practice 
sessions. At 4, Lendl was hitting tennis balls against a wall with a wooden 
paddle. If he could not find someone to play, Lendl went back to the wall, 
which he didn't really like. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't beat the wall," Lendl once said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's parents quickly recognized their son's ability and signed him up at 
their local sports club. Lendl became part of the so-called "Czech tennis 
factory," which produced such stars as Jan Kodes, Martina Navratilova, Hana 
Mandlikova and Tomas Smid. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 13, Lendl could beat his father. At 14, he could beat his mother. 
At 18, Lendl was the best junior player in the world, winning the junior titles 
at Wimbledon, the French Open and the Italian Open. He played his first U.S. 
Open in 1978 at 18 and lost in the first round, but he has either won it or 
lost in the final every year since 1982. 
</P>

There are eight Grand Slam titles among Lendl's 87 tournament championships, 
even if Wimbledon's trophy remains elusive. Next year, Lendl said, he will 
probably prepare for Wimbledon in the same way he did this year. 
</P>
<P>
This week and next, he will see what happens at the U.S. Open. But first, a 
question: Has he gotten over Wimbledon yet? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, pretty much so," he said. "I knew (losing) was a possibility even when I 
decided making it my goal was what I wanted to do. And I . . . just didn't win. 
Stefan played well. He deserved to win and that's the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't brood over it. You have to forget it and go full speed ahead." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lendl still has the four-wheel-drive vehicle. Better watch out 
for the spray of gravel this year, too.

KIRSTIE ALLEY USED TO SEE SCRIPTS FOR ICE QUEENS AND ALIENS. THEN THE LAUGHS 
SHE GOT ON 'CHEERS' OPENED THE DOOR TO MOVIE COMEDY.

Racks of colorful dresses, business suits, pants, blouses and night gowns with 
tags from Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullocks, Nordstrom and Neiman-Marcus sit baking 
in the sun outside Kirstie Alley's trailer on the Warner Hollywood lot. Inside, 
between scenes of Carl Reiner's lastest film, "Sibling Rivalry," Alley jokes 
and fusses with her wardrobe people, there to outfit her for the sequel to last 
fall's blockbuster "Look Who's Talking," which will begin production just as 
she completes her work in Reiner's comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to start on "Look Who's Talking II" in Vancouver the day after 
I wrapped here," Alley says in her distinctively raspy voice. "I told them, 'No 
way.' So now I think I have one whole day off to fly up there." She pauses, 
setting up the joke as she's learned to do over the past three seasons as the 
neurotic and obsessively chaste bar manager on NBC's durable hit series, 
"Cheers." "I'm a really big star now, you know. I really do have that much 
power." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aphrodisiac for most actors, though, is not power, but feeling 
wanted. And Kirstie Alley, the 35-year-old star from Kansas whom Ted Danson 
describes as "a biker chick crossed with an earth mother," is a wanted woman. 
Alley may not have been able to finagle many days off this summer, but the 
directors of both "Sibling Rivalry" and "Look Who's Talking II" wanted her 
badly enough to shuffle their shooting schedules to accommodate her busy acting 
life. 
</P>
<P>
She shot Reiner's movie, which will open in October, during May and June. She 
shot the sequel to her one and only blockbuster, scheduled for a Christmas 
release, right after that. And with a break only long enough for an appearance 
in Maria Shriver's recent prime-time celebrity special, Alley has already 
returned for another eight months of "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a cocaine addiction that she kicked before coming to Hollywood 11 years 
ago, despite never having acted in a comedy before "Cheers" and despite the 
overwhelming failure of her last film, "Madhouse," Alley is, according to 
Reiner, about to burst into the elite ranks of comic actresses. Earlier this 
month, as if to prove his point, Alley received her first Emmy nomination as 
best actress in a comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
All this for a woman who could have ruined "Cheers" when she replaced Shelley 
Long in 1987 after forgettable roles as a sultry alien in the movie "Star Trek 
II," an antebellum beauty in the TV miniseries "North and South" and an uptight 
goody-two-shoes teacher in "Summer School." But the much-beloved sitcom 
survived, and even thrived, with Alley managing the bar. Last year, "Cheers" 
won the Emmy for best comedy series; this past season it ended up the third 
most popular program on TV behind only "Roseanne" and "The Cosby Show." Then, 
last fall, Alley teamed with John Travolta and director Amy Heckerling in one 
of the year's biggest and perhaps most surprising smashes, "Look Who's 
Talking," which earned nearly $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very graceful and ebullient and she's funny," said Reiner, taking a 
break from a newspaper crossword puzzle while waiting for his crew to light the 
next shot. "Off the set she cracks everybody up. She's a real cutup. She's 
always thinking funny, and with people like that, you can really use them and 
embellish upon their creativity. She has everything every comedian has had from 
Carole Lombard to Jean Arthur. I'm really going to miss her on my next picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this too much?" he asks, interrupting his foray into hyperbole. "It's not 
too much because it's the same thing I tell my wife. Just watch Kirstie for a 
few minutes. You'll see it." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, Kirstie Alley performs. First, with co-star Bill Pullman, she 
does several takes of a scene in which they argue over who is best equipped to 
remove a condom from a man who died in the throes of passion. As Reiner yells 
"Cut!" for the final time, Alley leaps onto the mannequin corpse as if jumping 
on a runaway horse and pretends to make raucous love to it. Most everyone on 
the set doubles over with laughter. Reiner rushes Alley to the playback monitor 
so she can witness her lusty shenanigans herself, and the entire set erupts in 
belly laughs again. 
</P>
<P>
"She's outrageous," Danson said. "She has this wonderful combination of being 
incredibly vulnerable and extremely outrageous. She knows no fear. Most of us 
walk around concerned about how people perceive us, but she is totally 
unconcerned about that. She's one of those people who is not afraid to do 
anything in life, and her acting, I think, is becoming more and more like her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Alley is afraid of photographers, actually -- so concerned about the way she'll 
look on camera or in stills that the "Sibling Rivalry" crew built a special 
horseshoe-shaped light, covered with blue plastic gel, that fits around the 
movie camera and casts her in soft, pretty hues. When a photographer arrived on 
the set to snap her picture for this story, she insisted that he use her 
special light. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it's odd that Alley, at this point in her career, would go to such 
extremes to manage her image. Of course, no actor, no matter how much they 
protest, is free from that deadly sin called vanity. They have to be at least a 
little vain to get up on stage in the first place. But it was Alley's looks -- 
that big brown hair, those catlike blue eyes, that hard biker-chick/ice-queen 
attitude -- that prevented any director from considering her for a comedy role 
before James Burrows took a chance on her in "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to do comedy films because those were the movies I loved 
growing up -- Doris Day and Rock Hudson and Tony Randall and movies like 
'Pillow Talk.' I loved those romantic comedies," Alley says. "But everyone 
thought I was so serious and such a tight-ass. My agent would say, 'Would you 
consider Kirstie for this role?' and they would go, 'Oh yeah, right, she's real 
(expletive) funny.' They don't believe you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, let's face it, we're not dealing with rocket scientists here. If 
someone has not seen you do it before, they assume that you can't do it. I 
think that they forget that actors are people that act. They want to see you 
only in one way, and I don't know if that's based on your looks or what, but 
it's like after I did 'Star Trek,' I was offered every alien part you could 
possibly fathom. I was the girl who played aliens. So that's why I've avoided 
anything even remotely connected to sci-fi." 
</P>
<P>
Alley admits that she took "Cheers," even though she was relishing a bunch of 
movie offers at the time like her girl-in-trouble part in "Shoot to Kill," 
hoping that it would launch her into the world of comedy films. "Don't most 
actors do that?" she asks. "I mean, the ideal scene is features. But 'Cheers' 
is the best learning experience I could have ever had. I always had an instinct 
for comedy because I knew I was funny in my life, but I had no idea about props 
or physical comedy or even how loud I should speak. Jimmy Burrows would give me 
little bits -- a little shtick here and there -- and that's how I learned." 
</P>
<P>
Burrows, "Cheers' " principal director and one of three executive producers, 
said that they made a conscious effort not to hire a "comedienne" to replace 
Long when she decided to jump full-time into features. He had seen Alley in a 
production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Mark Taper and was struck by her 
"hot and sultry" presence and her "great voice." And, Burrows said, the 
original idea for the character of Rebecca, the bar's new boss, was that of a 
tough, beautiful martinet. The humor would emanate from Sam's growing 
instability over her cool and unwavering rejection of his sexual advances. They 
didn't think they needed someone already facile in the fine art of sitcom 
humor, and Alley, even though the characterization perpetuated the image of her 
as the hard, sultry vixen, fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Burrows said that from her first show, Alley surprised them with her own 
scatterbrained neuroses. In that first episode, Burrows said, Alley was 
supposed to enter her office, but she had a terrible time just opening the 
door. "From that minute," Burrows recalled, "I realized that there was 
something to be tapped there. So we started to write to that neurosis, and she 
became funnier and funnier." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Alley a sought-after comic actress, Burrows said, "is that you don't 
see it coming. She's got that hair and that face, and you don't think a woman 
who looks like that should be funny. And yet she is. Comedy is surprise, and 
comedy coming from this sultry woman surprises you and makes you laugh that 
much harder." 
</P>
<P>
Danson admitted he was nervous about having to work with a new actress and 
learn a "new dance step" after his partnership with Long had proven so 
successful. But Alley, he said, plunged into the show with a reckless 
"chutzpah" and "really did breathe new life" into it. 
</P>
<P>
And, her calculated professional moves paying off big, she breathed life into 
her film career as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers" helped her get "Look Who's Talking" and myriad other offers, Alley 
said, and "Look Who's Talking," her first leading film role and a surprise 
bonanza for Tri-Star, raised her salary. But in the media hoopla over John 
Travolta's "comeback" and director Heckerling's return to the acclaim she 
enjoyed with 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," Alley was largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from the production office in Vancouver, British Columbia, 
where she was about to begin directing the sequel, Heckerling said that Alley 
appeals to audiences because "without being weak, she has a certain 
vulnerability. And without being gross, she can be funny. A lot of the time, 
women who are funny are not attractive or feminine. She has all of that and 
she's funny." 
</P>
<P>
But the director bristled at reminders of all the stories in the press last 
fall slighting Alley, focusing instead on the "comebacks" of Travolta and 
herself. "Where were we before this supposed comeback?" she asked, calling that 
kind of attention "something that just makes you angry." When pressed about 
Alley's role in the success of the film, Heckerling sarcastically replied: 
"Let's see, 3% was the script, 70% was Kirstie, 12% was John. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Alley is more composed when discussing the media's skepticism over her ability 
to bring in the masses. After all, there's no denying that with "Cheers" she 
stepped into television's equivalent of a souped-up Ferrari that had already 
roared its way into the Nielsen Top 5. On "Look Who's Talking," she was teamed 
with a man who once was one of the world's biggest movie stars, but the ad 
campaign focused on the film's gimmick: a talking fetus/baby with voice 
supplied by Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
With a not-so-stellar cast and a not-so-clever gimmick, "Madhouse" flopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with a quiet, quiet success," said Alley, who is married to 
former "Hardy Boys" star Parker Stevenson and is now pregnant with their first 
child. On "Cheers" this season, her condition will be written into the plot. 
"In the first place, my part in 'Look Who's Talking' isn't, like, this great 
acting feat. We're not talking 'Sophie's Choice' here. I think that the goal, 
especially if you're a woman, is to set yourself up with successes, however 
they come, so that you can get the kind of movie you want to do green-lighted 
and into production. It's much harder for a woman to get a movie into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics are that women's movies just don't make as much money as men's 
movies, and this is a business that is about making money, right? Even when a 
woman has a huge hit, she always seems to have a hard time getting any credit 
for the success. I notice that in all of those big Spielberg movies, none of 
those women were ever catapulted anywhere. Maybe if you could get a woman 
character that was Rambette, then you'd have something. But who wants to play 
Rambette? Men are silly. They'll play anything." 
</P>
<P>
What Alley really wants to play is a small-town Kansas trailer park queen. "I'm 
always playing someone who is from a higher income level than I knew growing 
up. A little more sophisticated, a little better educated than I am," said 
Alley, who, to quell deep-seated insecurities, developed a cocaine addiction 
while working as an interior decorator in her hometown of Wichita, Kan., in the 
late 1970s. She kicked her habit with the help of a cold-turkey rehab program 
before moving to Los Angeles to become an actress. She is now the national 
spokesperson for Narconon -- the program she credits with saving her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more of a handle on that kind of babe from Kansas than all these other 
women I'm always playing, and I do have a real desire to act that, to show that 
side of me." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, Alley was ready to show off that wild side Danson finds 
so charming. With the ease of a practiced movie star, she ushered her young 
personal assistant off to hire a car to take her to a private party for rock 
star David Bowie. "Make sure it's a town car, not a limousine," she called 
after him, suddenly remembering her high-profile celebrity-activist 
participation in environmental causes. "It doesn't look too good to preach all 
this concern for the environment and then show up in some superstretch limo." 
</P>
<P>
Then, turning to a female member of the "Sibling Rivalry" crew, she wistfully 
revealed her secret desires for the evening. "I hope Billy Idol is there. I 
just want to sit there and stare at him."

KID FROST RAPS TO LA RAZA; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS DENOUNCE THE GANG REFERENCES, BUT THE RAPPER SAYS HIS MUSIC IS A 
REFLECTION OF CHICANO CULTURE IN EAST L.A. 
</P>

<P>
Politics and the arts have always been intertwined in the Chicano movement -- 
El Movimiento. Cesar Chavez's efforts beginning in the mid-'60s in Central 
California to unionize farm workers were dramatized by Luis Valdez's Teatro 
Campesino -- a company that was founded in 1965 and inspired countless Chicano 
theater groups, which used the stage to explore other political issues, 
including the Vietnam War, job discrimination and immigration policies. The 
political awakening of La Raza -- "The Race" -- was also played out against the 
backdrop of murals in cities across America. But, since those fiery beginnings, 
social gains have led to increased assimilation and somewhat cooled the fervor 
of the Chicano spirit. In turn, the number of Chicano theater groups has 
diminished and Chicano art was homogenized when it entered the mainstream 
commercial art world. Here in Los Angeles, scene of early '70s protests and 
boycotts, an upcoming theater production and a retrospective exhibition recall 
the spirit of La Raza and help cast some perspective on the evolution of 
Chicano politics. (A contemporary manifestation of Chicano awareness is the rap 
music of Kid Frost. Despite his controversial use of gang imagery, the East 
L.A. rapper is stirring pride among the younger generation with his hit single 
"La Raza." Page 8.) 
</P>
<P>
Kid Frost, whose stark "La Raza" single is the first national expression of 
Latino rap social consciousness, didn't want to meet for an interview in a 
restaurant or a record company office. 
</P>
<P>
Frost -- a squat, muscular man with a tattoo of a pit bull on his right forearm 
and one of a panther on the left -- wanted to meet beneath the bridge at 4th 
and Lorena streets in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This is Chicano Gang Central, a graffiti-dominated concrete landscape that was 
used in the movie "Colors" as the site of violent clashes. Frost, 28, chose to 
meet here because he thought it would help shed light on the stark, sometimes 
brutal imagery in his raps. 
</P>
<P>
"All you see is WF, WF, WF," Frost said, pointing to the graffiti marking the 
territory as that of the White Fence, a gang that has been part of the Chicano 
community for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
"And see there . . . it says 'Blood Killer,' " he said, showing where a WF had 
been crossed out and superseded by marks associated with what he described as a 
black gang. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, whose real name is Arthur Molina Jr., is making his own mark on the 
heretofore largely black rap world with "La Raza," a defiant, bilingual 
statement of Chicano pride from his debut album, "Hispanic Causing Panic." The 
song's topic is his obsession, as manifested in his attire this hot summer 
afternoon: His black pants, bandanna and "L.A." cap eschewed affiliation to any 
specific gang, but identified him as a proud cholo. 
</P>
<P>
"I made 'La Raza' for the Mexicans," he said of the song whose title means "The 
Race." "That was my coming-out song . . . describing who I am and where I live. 
It was a rap version of 'Colors.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the song, Frost said, "It's me going into the mind of a cholo." It's a tense 
cruise around East L.A. with a young "Aztec warrior" who keeps his gun loaded 
and threatens to use his "Mafioso" connections against anyone who crosses him. 
Though brutal, the song makes it clear that the message is for, by and of 
Chicanos: 
</P>
<P>
I stand alone ese like Al Capone 
</P>
<P>
Ese controla todo so don't ever try to sweat me 
</P>
<P>
Some of you don't know what's happening que pasa 
</P>
<P>
It's not for you anyway, 'cause this is for the Raza. 
</P>
<P>
That the message has been taken to heart was demonstrated when two teen-age 
Chicanos walking by recognized Frost while he posed for photos. Excitedly, they 
spoke of him as a new hero and of "La Raza" as a long-awaited breakthrough for 
Chicano culture. 
</P>
<P>
"(The song is) about what Hispanic people are all about," said German Corda, 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Before Kid Frost, said his friend Everardo Stemplesca, 16, "Los Lobos was it" 
as far as East L.A.-identified pop music was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
But, while Corda and Stemplesca were eager to shake Frost's hand and tell him 
to keep on with his message, others in the community, such as Gerard Meraz, a 
20-year-old Los Angeles City College student, want to take him to task for it. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the video of "La Raza" on MTV, Meraz called The Times' bilingual 
Nuestro Tiempo publication asking that a story be written about what he 
believes to be negative stereotypes that are furthered by the song. Meraz is 
particularly concerned about the video, which consists of scenes in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"All they do is hang out and drive around," Meraz said of the people in the 
video. "People who probably haven't met a real Hispanic will think this must be 
true if one of their own people is presenting that like this." 
</P>
<P>
But, responded Frost, that's the point: It is true. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth hurts them bad," he said, snapping back at his critics. "Chicanos 
have been doing that (hanging out and cruising) since back in the days of the 
vatos in the '40s. (Meraz) is going to college and that's good, but what about 
the ones that don't and are stuck in the barrio? . . . What do you want them to 
be doing in the video? In the library?" 
</P>
<P>
If some within the Chicano community are uncomfortable with "La Raza," it goes 
without saying that some outside that world would be too. The violent imagery 
in "La Raza" met with enough resistance from radio programmers that, at Virgin 
Records' suggestion, Frost changed some of the lyrics for a "Gringo mix" 
version. 
</P>
<P>
"We encountered some negative comments about the track," said Virgin product 
manager Diana Freed. "People were not really understanding what Kid Frost is 
about. If you look at the actual lyrics, it's a very anti-violence song, but 
taken on a superficial level, people are shocked. His lyrics are going to be 
hard and confrontational. . . . It's a very Latin machismo stance that he's 
got, but that's who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Even some in the Chicano community who are uncomfortable with the images say it 
does speak of a part of the community that can be traced back to the pachucos 
of the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not like it and think it doesn't reflect on the entire community, and 
it does not," said Dr. Raul Ruiz, Chicano Studies professor at Cal State 
Northridge. "But there's no work and employment and educational opportunities 
(for many young Chicanos), so what do you do? 
</P>
<P>
"You hang out and sometimes that may not look like a positive activity. . . . 
Sometimes all (young Chicanos) have is their car and their friends, and 
inevitably sometimes this leads to problems." 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Delgado, a director, choreographer and actor who oversaw the recent 
Chicano Composers Music Awards Festival for La Plaza de la Raza, concurs. 
"There are certain things (Kid Frost) uses that in terms of mainstream Chicanos 
are offensive because we spent all our lives to become middle Americans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a sobering effect for people who understand what's going on. We've 
been censored and denied that we even founded this part of the country. . . . 
What he's saying is empowering himself. It's very reflective of how the 
minorities feel. You have to go back and say, 'Hey, power for la Raza.' " 
</P>
<P>
Frost says he neither endorses nor condones violence and has been active with 
anti-gang and anti-drug programs. In the song "Come Together," he addresses the 
issue: 
</P>
<P>
 Is that the way you want to go out? 
</P>
<P>
 For the name of a street, 
</P>
<P>
 Getting your damn brains blown out? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But he makes no apologies for the images he uses. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want us to hide our culture, but what about the thousands of 
kids not given a chance to go to college?" he said. " 'Hispanic Causing Panic' 
is for all kinds of Chicanos. Don't blame me for a problem that's been plaguing 
us since before 1950, before I was even born." 
</P>
<P>
Though he was born in Los Angeles, Kid Frost grew up outside of the East L.A. 
Chicano culture: His father was a career Army man and his family lived on and 
near bases around the United States, as well as in Guam and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
While he spent each summer with his grandmother in East L.A. ("My dad wanted to 
keep me in tune with Hispanic culture"), Frost says that he didn't see the dark 
side of that world until his late teens. 
</P>
<P>
"When my dad retired, I was 16 and suddenly put in this environment," he said. 
"My parents didn't clue me in on what was going down on the streets. So when I 
left the pad at 18 I unfortunately got caught up in the violence of the City of 
Angels -- there aren't too many angels. It's a city under siege now." 
</P>
<P>
Frost refused to comment specifically about what gang he was involved with or 
its activities, but said he grew uncomfortable as the violence grew more 
serious. "When it was just fists and boxing I liked it," he said, noting that 
he had boxed as a teen in the Police Athletic League. "But when it got crazy 
with guns, I got out." 
</P>
<P>
A turning point came for him when he first heard the seminal Sugarhill Gang rap 
single "Rapper's Delight." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always been doing poetry, but stuff that was crazy for girls," he said. He 
began adapting his talent to fit the rap format, and in 1982 was inspired by 
"The Message," the socially conscious rap breakthrough by New York's 
Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five. "That was my thing to get straight 
into rap," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Frost hooked up with the group DJ Tropical, performing in East L.A. and 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They let me do a show, and soon I started doing three or four house parties a 
night," he said.

Frost was heard by prominent L.A. rapper Ice-T, who made him part of his Rhyme 
Syndicate posse. Ice-T's influence is quite evident in Frost's even-toned, 
matter-of-fact delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard me rap and five minutes later he yanked me on stage," he said. "It 
was a USC frat party, all black. They gave me respect." 
</P>
<P>
With Ice-T's patronage, Frost began getting gigs at more L.A. clubs and became 
a regular on the "Saturday Night Party Mixes" show on KJLH-FM (102.3). As a 
rare Latino rapper, Frost also caught the attention of Low Rider magazine, 
which sent him on a tour performing at events and clubs around the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's using the status gained from being on a major record label to promote 
rap in the community through his Latin Alliance. The organization consists of 
10 rappers from places as diverse as Nicaragua, Spain and the Bronx as well as 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning to get all the dialects of Spanish on one album," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frost has already toured Mexico and Latino centers of the United States. Now 
he's ready to go places where his subject matter is less familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be going to England," he said. "Show them a culture they haven't 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
But his primary focus remains on East L.A., where he sees himself as the 
cutting edge of a musical tradition. "Los Lobos is pals with my uncle," he 
said. "Tierra, El Chicano, they all know Kid Frost. But rap music! It's the 
music of my streets."

"It wasn't even a step," Shirley MacLaine grimaces as she recalls the accident 
May 1 that could have ended her dance career. "Just the preparation for a step, 
and crrruuunnnch . . . it all tore open. I've never felt pain like that in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which tore the cartilage in her right knee, caused the 
postponement of the Los Angeles opening of her new musical revue, "Out There 
Tonight" (which opens a four-week engagement at the Pantages Theatre Tuesday), 
and caused serious concerns about her career. "The doctors said I might dance 
again," she recalls. "I thought it was a bad dream. I've never been injured in 
my life!" 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, it's 1 p.m. and 111 degrees in the shade. In the 
air-conditioned chill of her hotel suite, MacLaine, whose show opened to a 
sellout audience at Caesar's Palace the night before, has just awakened and is 
commencing her exercises. Bent vertically at the hips like a human paperclip, 
her curly red hair scratching the gray carpet, she grabs the phone and, peering 
backwards between her legs, begins chattering happily with a friend from 
Australia. The topics: her show, her upcoming engagement Down Under and her new 
films, "Postcards from the Edge" and "Waiting for the Light." 
</P>
<P>
"Postcards," the Mike Nichols film of Carrie Fisher's memoir, deals with 
Fisher's relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds. It opens in Los Angeles 
Sept. 14 and nationally a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Amid reminders of her accident -- her knee is still taped for performances, a 
protection she hopes to discard before the L.A. opening, and she works out with 
weights for hours daily to strengthen her leg -- MacLaine speaks about the 
injury, her new projects and a career that has endured longer than many 
Americans have lived. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been dancing for 53 years," she says, hanging up the phone and 
straightening up. "And I never had an accident before. I still don't know what 
really happened." 
</P>
<P>
The knee was actually injured twice. "The first time was March 20, after we had 
been on the road with the new show for three weeks and were in Seattle. About 
halfway through, I just went down. I wasn't in pain, but I knew I had 
dislocated my kneecap. The whole thing seized up and I couldn't turn. I 
finished the show -- it is genetically impossible for me to walk off a stage, 
I'd rather die -- and they carried me off." 
</P>
<P>
Final performances in Seattle were cancelled and the next opening postponed for 
a week while MacLaine treated the knee with therapy and iced it down the rest 
of the time. "Then, just before the Los Angeles opening, I was in the rehearsal 
hall and it happened," she recalls of the second, more serious accident. "It 
just gave way." She underwent arthroscopic surgery at UCLA Medical Center. 
"They filmed the whole thing," she laughs, "and the big joke around UCLA was 
that it was the best movie Shirley MacLaine had ever been in!" 
</P>
<P>
After five weeks of all-day every-day physical therapy, she opened to sold-out 
audiences and critical acclaim in Pittsburgh. The accident even provided a 
bonus. "Because of the shift in dates," she explains, "we were able to add 
Japan, where I open right after Los Angeles, Australia, London and Paris." 
</P>
<P>
Did she ever doubt that she could make it in time? "No," she snaps, "that's the 
way I am. Everything is a question of attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine started ballet lessons at 2 1/2 years old in Richmond, Va. 
"From the very first day, I was in love with it," she recalls. "I can still 
remember the girls at the barre and about five of the boys." When she was 12, 
her parents and younger brother Warren (Beatty) moved to Arlington. "The 
heavy-duty transition in my life," she says, "was my enrollment in the 
Washington School of Ballet," which she attended daily after cheerleader 
practice at Washington and Lee High School. 
</P>
<P>
Following graduation, MacLaine moved to New York and had a brief flirtation 
with American Ballet Theatre. She grew too tall too fast to be a ballerina, but 
the experience came in handy when she made "The Turning Point" 24 years later. 
</P>
<P>
"I did lots of summer stock," she says, "10 shows a summer, with acting and 
dance classes in the winter." Her big break came in 1954, when she was picked 
to be Carol Haney's understudy in "Pajama Game." The first night she went on 
for Haney, producer Hal Wallis was in the theater. He subsequently arranged a 
screen test. The next time she took the stage Alfred Hitchcock was in the 
theater. He cast her in "The Trouble With Harry," her first film. "You have to 
have a mystic streak after that," she smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Prince was the stage manager for "Pajama Game," she recalls, "and he told 
me I was making a huge mistake to leave the chorus and make films." Since then, 
she has made 40 movies, five television specials, a series of self-help videos, 
produced and toured in four one-woman shows, written six books, married and 
raised a daughter, Sachi, herself an actress. She and Steve Parker, her husband 
for 27 years, divorced in 1987. She claims she never hears from him and has no 
idea where he is. 
</P>
<P>
"Postcards From the Edge" stars Meryl Streep in the Carrie Fisher role and 
MacLaine as Debbie Reynolds (named Doris Mann in the film). The script was 
written by Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me how you liked it," MacLaine asks anyone who has been to a screening. 
"Waddya think of it?" 
</P>
<P>
The role includes a performance of Stephen Sondheim's "I'm Still Here," with 
new lyrics by Sondheim, that nearly stops the show -- the song has recently 
been added to MacLaine's revue. Her battery of visual ad-libs also brought 
howls of laughter to the preview audience. "Well," MacLaine laughs, "acting is 
ad-libbing. Let's put it this way. I got into the part! Not much plot," 
MacLaine says of "Postcards," which limns Fisher's battle with drugs and her 
domineering mother's response. "Just a slice of life." 
</P>
<P>
Any parallels to her relationship with Sachi? The question is raised by the 
presence, in a scene from "Postcards," of a framed, real-life Life magazine 
cover from 1959 of MacLaine and Sachi, representing Doris and daughter. "I 
don't think I would have the courage to act like Doris even if I felt like it. 
I think I would feel I had to be more motherly, more sensitive and more . . . 
democratic," she smiles. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if there were elements of "Mommie Dearest" in her portrayal -- after 
all, she's known all the dragon ladies of Hollywood -- she asserts, "No, no, 
the difference is that Doris Mann, who sees everything through her own point of 
view, also included her daughter in that point of view. The stereotypical 
Hollywood mothers didn't -- they would put their child on a lower priority 
level than what they were doing. Doris Mann wants to include her daughter, but 
she wants her to do it all her way." 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Reynolds wanted to play herself in the film and that 
MacLaine beat her out for the part. MacLaine admits, "I called her as soon as 
they approached me and asked what she thought. Debbie said, 'I think it would 
be great, because you're funny.' 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing is that everyone making the film really had a keen interest in 
portraying an accurate slice of life in female Hollywood. I have been through 
it. A female actor is discussed all the time in Hollywood -- weight gain, 
lines, aging, or who is the boyfriend who might be trouble here? Nobody does 
that with male actors, at least not as much," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, it seems a woman is considered out of her prime when she's past 40," 
MacLaine says. 
</P>
<P>
There is a scene in "Postcards" that may come as a shock to MacLaine fans, used 
to her usual glamorous appearance. Doris Mann is in the hospital, looking 
ancient: no makeup, balding and no eyebrows. Did MacLaine, halfway through her 
sixth decade and feeling as she does about Hollywood's attitude toward women's 
age, have any misgivings about being presented so unglamorously? "No," she says 
slowly, "I didn't think of it as taking a chance. That is what the character 
looked like, and I never thought of myself at all. But then, I never do." 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine will also be seen in October in "Waiting for the Light," co-starring 
with Teri Garr. She plays a circus performer who creates a trick that is taken 
to be a miracle. It's "a comedic examination of what happens to the values of a 
small town when a perceived miracle starts drawing money," she says, expression 
wry. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome UFOs and Crews" proclaim the welcome mats at MacLaine's five-bedroom 
apartment in a building she put up in Malibu 30 years ago. The otherworldly 
welcome acknowledges the controversy generated by the books about her path to 
self-realization, her interest in out-of-body experiences and reincarnation and 
the self-help seminars she led for a year or so. The latter, particularly, were 
frequently met with derision by the press. 
</P>
<P>
Did any of this bother her? "Not really," she says. The seminars, which drew 
upwards of 1,800 people paying $300 each, were three-day events. "I really 
enjoyed them, but the press was making a big deal about it as though I was 
starting a new religion. That bothered me, and it also bothered me when 
groupies started to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a guru and I don't want to be. I'm very uncomfortable with that role." 
In the past she has said that the money from the seminars would be used to 
build a spiritual center, and, she says, it will be. Two hundred acres of 
Colorado land have been purchased, and as soon as she and her architect 
determine the appropriate design and material (it will not be built of wood -- 
she is deeply involved in fighting the destruction of trees), it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Although MacLaine spends most of her free time at her home in Washington state, 
on the banks of the Puyallup River surrounded by the trees she loves, the 
Malibu homestead, which is furnished in an unostentatious, rather 1960s style, 
is full of pictures of a life in the limelight: with Fidel Castro, with Nikita 
Khrushchev, with Bella Abzug, Jimmy Carter, the Rat Pack, accepting her Oscar 
in 1984 for "Terms of Endearment." But closest to her heart are the photographs 
of her mother, father and brother and all that they represent to her life and 
career. Questioned why she thinks both children of a relatively obscure couple 
achieved such fame, the actress becomes serious. 
</P>
<P>
"The hidden agenda here," she observes, "is my mother and my dad. They devoted 
their lives to us. They had their problems, their frustrations and very 
definitely their sense of disappointment in not having expressed themselves 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
She often thinks about her father, Ira Beaty, who died three years ago. He was 
the principal of an elementary school that she attended in Virginia and later 
dealt in real estate when frustrated by the "peanut politics" of an education 
career. "Apparently he really suffered during the Depression," she explains. 
"Support of the family was very important to him, so whatever creative 
interests he had -- he taught me to play the violin -- were put aside. And 
Mother (Kathlynn, who splits her time between her son and daughter's homes) was 
desirous of being an actress all her life, read poetry and was a great painter. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a communicator." MacLaine adds. "I'm just using these 
different avenues, acting, singing, dancing, writing, to communicate . . . 
probably to communicate the dreams that my parents never realized. I recognized 
a long time ago that one's mother and father are the most important people in 
your life. They're the ones that mold and encourage and intimidate and cajole. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case there were things my parents wanted to do that they didn't and, in 
some ways, I'm doing it for them." 
</P>
<P>
The story of "Postcards From the Edge" surfaces again: "It deals with problems 
with parents and working them out in a way that is positive and contributive. 
Carrie was always concerned that it be done in a loving way, and I think we 
did. And I've had the experience with my mother wanting me to be something and 
had my own feelings of wanting my daughter to be something." 
</P>
<P>
This urge to please her parents, she believes, is as much a part of Beatty's 
success as her own. "Sure it is," she says. "Look at 'Dick Tracy.' It's his 
dissertation on his childhood. And that's why I think it was so brilliantly 
done." 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine's eyes well with tears. "I think both of us have a need, a deeply felt 
melancholy respect for the dreams unrealized by our parents, so we fulfill 
theirs, and ours." 
</P>
