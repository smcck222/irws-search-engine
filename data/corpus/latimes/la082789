A recent episode of "21 Jump Street" involved the issue of racism. It was so 
brilliantly written and performed that I simply don't believe it can be 
equaled. My reasons for giving this review are simple. Ever since I was old 
enough to understand topics such as prejudice or racism (which unfortunately 
for me was at a very young age), I have always tried to distance myself. To me, 
the hate was a disease. Catch the disease and you're hooked. I just couldn't 
understand how men could hate each other solely on the basis of looks and 
beliefs. Even now at the age of 16, I still have problems coping with it. I 
admit that I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but it helps to 
know that I am not alone. My compliments to the cast and crew of "21 Jump 
Street" and Fox Broadcasting for their efforts in bringing this issue to the 
public's attention.

The recent "Eye on L.A." program on Chile was a disgrace! Not only did it 
mispronounce half of the city's names, but it portrayed Chile as the "fashion 
capital of the world." Chile has always been known for its culture, not for its 
designers!

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: NO REGRETS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFINING THE ESSENCE OF A MAN BY THE THINGS HE'S CHOSEN NOT TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith

<TEXT>
<P>
CLAIRE WEINBERG,my travel agent, was reflecting the other day on things that 
she and her husband haven't done. She specified four things. They have never 
bought a lottery ticket; they have never been camping; they have never had room 
service, and they have never used an automatic teller. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't tell whether her attitude toward these lapses was one of regret, 
pride or, simply, wonder. At a certain age, one tends to review one's life and 
worry that one has been passed by by the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
If we have led decent lives and have clear consciences, we are more likely to 
regret the things we haven't done than those that we have. On the other hand, I 
have never used an automatic teller, and I don't regret it. I am rather 
intimidated by such machines. 
</P>
<P>
I did buy a lottery ticket that week when the payoff was up to $40 million or 
something close to that. It occurred to me that $40 million would actually 
change my life, though I wasn't sure that $1 million or even $10 million would. 
</P>
<P>
For a mere $1 million, I doubted that I would even quit my job, as most winners 
do. I was more interested in seeing what I would do with $40 million than with 
actually having it. I was curious about untapped urgings, about what changes in 
my character that great riches might work. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, I never found out. 
</P>
<P>
I have been camping and I have had room service. Given a choice, I'd take room 
service. I have never understood why anyone would deliberately resort to a 
Neanderthal life style for a weekend on the pretext of having fun. My idea of 
camping out is to order room service in the Santa Barbara Biltmore or some such 
retreat and lie in bed, watching while the waiter wheels a table into the room 
and lays out the white napery and the silver flatware, pours hot decaf, takes 
the lids off plates of scrambled eggs and bacon and then unfolds a copy of The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
If I were Mrs. Weinberg and her husband, I would certainly court an opportunity 
to have room service. Avoiding it is self-denial of the most Spartan sort. 
</P>
<P>
I can't think of many things I would like to do that I haven't done. I have 
never owned a Porsche, an Alfa Romeo, a Ferrari or a Rolls-Royce, and I am not 
especially eager to. I have been to most of the capitals of the Western world, 
but I have never been to Asia. I have seen the Parthenon but not the Pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
I have stood in battle; I have had a coronary bypass; I have fathered two 
children; I have published eight books; I have read half the works of 
Shakespeare; in my youth I was a 108-pound wrestling champion of the Whittier 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
I never graduated from college; I have never learned to fly; I have never 
finished Will and Ariel Durant's "Story of Civilization"; I have never been 
baptized; I have never made a parachute jump; I have never been divorced; I 
have never been invited to the White House by a President. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the things I haven't done I haven't done because I didn't want to 
(except being invited to the White House). There are a great many more things I 
don't want to do than things that I do. That is perhaps the only serious 
difference between my wife and me. She is an adventurer. She will try almost 
anything. If there are any unexplored regions left in the upper Amazon, she 
would love to explore them. Her appetite and her energy are boundless. Also, 
she is fearless. She simply does not believe that anything bad can happen to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, I am more timorous and contemplative. I'd rather sit in the 
comfort of my living room and see the Pyramids on TV than make that arduous 
trip to Cairo. I have no desire to ride a camel. I do not enjoy air travel. I 
do not want to see France from a balloon. I did enjoy our cruise up the Danube, 
but that was because there was nothing to do but lie in a deck chair and watch 
the castles go by. 
</P>
<P>
But this morning, I got a Diet Coke out of a machine at the car wash. Maybe I 
could learn to operate an automatic teller.

It is with an extreme sense of ironic incredulity that I view Abramson. She 
makes the statement about being "bathed in the backwash of the Holocaust," yet 
she defends those whose crimes are no less heinous than the vile, Nazi thugs 
she deplores. One wonders if she would have been so charitable at Nuremburg.

One portion of "The Defender" centered on the ethics/lack of ethics involved in 
The Times' running a specific story during the Bob's Big Boy murder trial 
several years ago. The D.A.'s office maintained that Abramson was using her 
husband's (Tim Rutten's) employment to further her own interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing the focus back to July, 1989, what could be more unethical than 
running Abramson's and Rutten's denials in the Los Angeles Times Magazine? 
Whether the charges were true or false, the question remains: Was "The 
Defender" an objective/impartial profile or a manipulative whitewash/defense of 
The Times?

When Abramson's client herds people into a freezer and shoots them to death, 
he's the one I can see wearing a swastika -- not the state who sentenced him. 
These "adorable," "sweet," "tragic" and "pathetic" guys she's defending are the 
inhumane, the unjust, the dehumanizers.

RECORD RACK: THE BEACH BOYS "STILL CRUISIN'." CAPITOL * 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED 
ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC) STARS.

Still cruisin'? Still coastin' is more like it. In reverse. And it's not just 
because seven of the 10 songs on the first "new" Beach Boys album in four years 
are recycled from film scores (and three of those are classics that have 
already each been on a zillion albums): Even the three all-new recordings, 
including Brian Wilson's "In My Car," only reaffirm the band's longstanding 
status as purveyors of empty nostalgia and pallid escapist fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, when they did a haunting remake of "California 
Dreamin'," these silver-haired surfers seemed to momentarily remember that the 
magic of their catalogue came not just from singing about escape, but also 
about what was being escaped from. 
</P>
<P>
Here it's as if last year's chart-topping success of the bubbly "Kokomo" (from 
"Cocktail" and included here) served not to inspire the band to seek new 
challenges, 
</P>
<P>
but rather to play it safe with virtual rewrites (the title song, from "Lethal 
Weapon 2," and the new "Island Girl"). Artistically speaking, surf's down.

RECORD RACK: L.A. GUNS "COCKED AND LOADED." VERTIGO/POLYGRAM ***: ALBUMS ARE

The sassy title of L.A. Guns' second album tells you exactly what you're going 
to get: a blast of hard rock, filled with broad references to girls, sex and 
over-the-edge night life. The L.A.-based quintet's blatant disregard for 
subtlety works, as long as you don't think too deeply. On songs like "Sleazy 
Come, Easy Go" and "Showdown (Riot on Sunset)," the band sports an enthusiasm 
for rock 'n' roll cliches that's either infectious or annoying, depending what 
side of the generation gap you inhabit. However, the band does take a few 
interesting turns -- "Magdalaine" burns with a '60s mysticism that hasn't been 
heard for a while, and "Give a Little" is a delicious blend of Aerosmith and 
Rose Tattoo. Although most of "Cocked and Loaded" is shallow and obvious 
entertainment, that's all you need to get your body moving and your fist 
pumping. JANISS GARZA

If this is therapy, Freud better stock up on malpractice insurance. Actually, 
anyone familiar with Wainwright's wacky history (this is the man who had a Top 
10 hit in 1973 singing about a dead skunk) will know that in his sketches on 
mental health, it's the "before" shot, not the "after," that matters. More and 
more in recent years, Wainwright has been zeroing in on the nuclear family 
(usually after detonation), so there are plenty of lonely ex's, single parents 
and distraught adult children all trying to cope -- mostly hilariously, 
sometimes poignantly -- with the traumas bequeathed them. Wainwright's knack 
for the brilliant turn of phrase and winsome melody is sharper than ever, and 
there's more of a country than folk feel to the music this time. Worried that 
it might be too dark or disturbing? Just lie down and go with that. RANDY LEWIS

A DICTIONARY CALLED JORJ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LET'S SAY, for reasons known best to your therapist, you decide to trade in 
your fat old tattered college dictionary for a sleek new dictionary on a disc. 
So you drop by your local weekend computer swap meet or you call your local 
shareware retailer and ask them to mail you JORJ. 
</P>
<P>
JORJ is a 58,000-word dictionary program with extremely concise definitions 
(pencil is defined in its entirety as a "writing instrument"; kite is a 
"lightweight airborne structure.") 
</P>
<P>
But most adults won't be using JORJ for the definitions anyway. Far more useful 
is its ability to guess what you're after from the phonetic spelling. Suppose 
it's 3 a.m. the night before your term paper is due and to show a little 
erudition you'd like to at least mention Rousseau. The only thing -- you never 
bought his book and the closest you can come to spelling his name is Ruesew. 
</P>
<P>
With JORJ, that's good enough. Up pops: "Rousseau, Jean Jacques, French 
philosopher (1712-1778)." 
</P>
<P>
On further investigation, you will discover that a phonetic "toemain" gets you 
ptomaine; "bulyabase" gets bouillabaisse and "sikiatry" gets you psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
Fun as the phonetic spelling, JORJ's most useful feature is its mini-database. 
Suppose you would like to look up some Indian tribes but can't remember the 
names, let alone spell them. In this case, just type Indian in JORJ's scan 
mode, and it will search the definitions of every word in the database for 
Indian. The result is some 110 Indian tribes or words with Indian in the 
definition, including: Choctaw, Kickapoo, Mohican, Nez Perce, Ojibway, Pequot, 
Pawnee and Shoshoni. 
</P>
<P>
The same experiment with dog gets you 84 words and definitions, including: 
Afghan, Airedale, Dandie dinmont and Lhasa apso (a small shaggy dog with long 
straight hair from Tibet). 
</P>
<P>
Entering president gets you a list of presidents, planet gets you a list of 
planets, and state gives you a list of all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial copy of JORJ is available for $6 (a two-disc set) from the Software 
Club; telephone (916) 725-4422. If you like the program and decide to use it, 
the registration fee (voluntary) is $30.

LESSONS FROM NATURE'S RHYTHMS;

<P>
'ORGANIC ABSTRACTIONS' EXHIBIT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING UNRAVEL ART'S MYSTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us have known people who would rather court failure by tackling a 
complex project than limit themselves to an easy task with few challenges. 
Happily, some of these people work at institutions that let them stretch their 
wings and risk a bumpy flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic Abstractions," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center (to Oct. 24), is an 
exhibit that shoots for the stars. Curator Dorrit Fitzgerald picked a theme 
that's notoriously hard to explain in ordinary language and plunged right in, 
combining a glorious group of paintings by Marc Pally of Los Angeles with work 
by two other California artists. She wrote essays for the accompanying 
brochure, which also contains brief historical remarks and a time line by 
Kathleen A. McCormick, and even dreamed up lists of words visitors could roll 
around on their tongues ("meditative," "cosmic space") to try to describe the 
indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are problems with this enterprise (we'll get to those shortly), 
it represents a genuine dedication to presenting unusual work and to helping 
unravel the mysteries of art for people who simply do not see what all the fuss 
is about. 
</P>
<P>
So what is organic abstraction, anyway? It's not a specific movement in art, 
but rather abstract work that takes its cue from the rhythmic forms of nature 
-- leaves and stems and roots and rocks. Imagery also comes from the facts and 
visual data about the universe that are revealed by astronomy, microbiology and 
physics. 
</P>
<P>
The most fruitful era for this type of work was the 1940s, when Abstract 
Expressionist painters explored so-called "biomorphic" imagery -- fluid shapes, 
loosely based on natural objects and sometimes wedded to fantastic mechanistic 
imagery grimly reminiscent of the horrors of World War II. In our era, organic 
abstraction has moved into new realms as diverse as Pattern Painting and 
conceptually based art. 
</P>
<P>
On first encounter, a single painting by Pally may seem to be a mishmash of 
ideas for several different works. It looks as though each element has a 
different scale and frame of reference, independent of the others. That's no 
accident. Pally's work is based on an analysis of the different kinds of 
pictorial "language" available to the artist, and the simple fact is that there 
is no way to reconcile all of them in a tidy package. 
</P>
<P>
So he feels free to doodle, paint, model, drip and even visibly scrub out marks 
he makes on the canvas in a range of media (including oil, graphite, charcoal, 
shellac and modeling paste). Forms can be tiny and compressed or large and 
sprawling; blindingly detailed passages bump up against loose washes of color. 
</P>
<P>
The imagery is a great stew of formal types borrowed from such fields as 
biology (bone shapes), botany (knobby vegetative forms) and chemistry (webs of 
lines that resemble atomic models). There is also a seemingly endless number of 
other kinds of shapes swiped from everyday life (a chair, a windmill blade), 
memories of landscapes and even memories of the organic abstraction in other 
artists' paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pally pays homage to the Abstract Expressionists' gestural freedom, 
his paintings also record the awareness of an artist in the late 20th Century 
that it is no longer possible to believe in the thundering romantic credos of 
an earlier era of modern art. This cynical age no longer believes in a single 
towering truth. Instead, the mind is obliged to make its own terms with the 
bewildering array of ideas that come its way. This self-conscious awareness of 
pluralism that cannot be reduced to any one idea is the key to the teeming flux 
of imagery that Pally teases into such a strange and compelling whole. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit brochure reprints a key remark Pally made several years ago ("I 
read in the newspaper that science is zeroing in on the centrality of 
uncertainty as the organizing principal of reality. That's what I always 
thought art was about.") 
</P>
<P>
But the brief text does not really discuss the reasons Pally paints the way he 
does. This is such difficult and important work that viewers really need all 
the help they can get. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its evident sincerity and flashes of keen commentary, the brochure is 
written in a clumsy way with sentences that often don't quite hang together. 
Complex ideas are compressed into very limited space, making the text hard to 
follow and sometimes factually misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Another facet of the exhibit -- lists of words posted in the gallery that 
supposedly relate to each artist's work -- is an experiment that needs to be 
developed more fully. Some of the words do not seem to be related to the art 
(how is Pally's work "theatrical"?) and others (such as "psycho-sexual") demand 
explanations of their own. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the lists seem to be putting the cart before the horse: Having an 
appropriate vocabulary at our fingertips may help the conversational flow, but 
first we have to have a clear, linear idea of what the works are about. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also falters in matters of emphasis and tone. While Pally can 
rightly be said to be a trailblazing painter, the accompanying work by Stephen 
Rubin and Stephanie Weber is more limited in scope. Yet the catalogue essays 
show no awareness of this distinction. 
</P>
<P>
We read, for example, that Rubin's forms "become metaphors for the infiniteness 
of human behavior as it is formed and re-formed by events of the outer world." 
That's just empty blather, certainly not much help in seeing what his work 
actually has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
In his brightly colored paintings, Rubin engineers combinations of curving 
shapes with firm contours. Tilting and twisting, these forms have a somewhat 
mechanistic quality, as though Rubin was trying to patent a new machine by 
adding such ingredients as cocked hats and hatching eggs to a superstructure of 
roots, bones and pipes. 
</P>
<P>
In "Hive Horn," a beehive-shaped form uncurls to become a horn, and an 
asymmetric cup shape turns upside down to drip out a strange blob that looks 
like cow udders. "Only Trust Your Heart" takes on the appearance of a desolate 
abstracted landscape, with roots and bones and hard ridges. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of these works depends on the freshness of the forms Rubin dreams 
up and the way they work rhythmically in space. Vivid color can only be icing 
on the cake, and sometimes Rubin seems to depend too much on its powers. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's work has undergone several metamorphoses during the last decade, but 
the constants seem to be her interest in layering imagery to evoke the floating 
depths of some primordial sea -- and a self-effacing, low-key quality that 
often seems more like a mumble than a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
In an uneven group of recent pieces, a triptych from her "Nysia Series" holds 
up best. On the central panel, white will-o'-the-wisps dance through a brownish 
background, like motes of light on a brackish lake. One of the panels on either 
side, which are painted with vertical or horizontal strokes of a wide brush, 
vaguely suggests a wooden pier submerged under water. The rigor inherent in the 
three-part composition and the simple geometry of the stripes offers a solid 
base for Weber's muted effects. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view, in the rear gallery, is the first of a yearlong series of small 
shows called "New Juice in Orange County," which replaces the former, 
larger-scale annual "New Juice" exhibit. Through Sept. 1, Miriam Smith is 
showing her black-and-white abstract pastels and a group of ceremonial objects 
from a trip she took up the Sepik River in Papua, New Guinea, in a dugout canoe 
-- a trip that supposedly inspired her work. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of that is hard to fathom. The small pastels are unreadably murky. One 
of three pieces from her dark "Bush Walking Series" offers an elongated flash 
of whiteness, like a mirage created by a fluke of light and water. A horizontal 
untitled drawing looks vaguely like a primeval landscape. Still another looks 
rather like the inside of a planetarium before the show begins. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, these pieces look like dry runs that haven't yet hit their stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organic Abstractions" continues through Oct. 24 at the Irvine Fine Arts 
Center. Also on view through Oct. 24 are abstract paintings by Marlon Dee Meyer 
and ethnic masks and folk art from the collection of Fullerton resident Mal 
Mealey. The current installment of "New Juice in Orange County" continues 
through Sept. 1. The center, at 14321 Yale Ave., is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Mondays through Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: SETTING PRIORITIES FOR BUDGET 
CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Murray Weidenbaum, MURRAY WEIDENBAUM is director of the Center for the Study 
of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis and the author of 
Rendezvous With Reality: The American Economy After Reagan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush seems sincerely determined to avoid a tax increase. But unless 
he leads a new effort to cut federal spending, the pressure to reduce the 
deficit via new tax proposals may overwhelm his resolve. 
</P>
<P>
There is an ambivalence -- likely quite unintentional -- in the Bush 
Administration's action to date on the two sides of the budget. When the 
subject of revenues comes up, the President is the solid conservative anxious 
to avoid increasing the proportion of the national income flowing through the 
federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
But when the spending side of the budget comes up, a much more liberal -- some 
would say "enlightened" -- George Bush comes to the fore. Of course, increases 
in federal appropriations for fighting acid rain, homelessness, illiteracy, 
savings and loan bankruptcies and nuclear waste are all worthy undertakings. 
</P>
<P>
But expanding such outlays increases the gap between federal revenues and 
expenditures. Identifying new priorities is only the first and easiest step in 
reordering budget priorities. The process is not complete, however, until the 
second and more difficult action is taken -- cutting back programs that are to 
be assigned lower priority. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all who have examined the details of the federal budget -- be they 
Republicans, Democrats or independents -- conclude that many things on which 
the federal government spends money are not worth the cost. These marginal 
items benefit individual localities, specific industries or particular interest 
groups. That is why they are in the budget. But, from the viewpoint of the 
nation as a whole, they are a poor investment. 
</P>
<P>
Budget cutting should be guided by two principles: fairness and effectiveness. 
To be fair, it should be very broadly based. An old Budget Bureau adage comes 
to mind: Good budgeting is the uniform distribution of dissatisfaction. No 
federal department or agency should be off limits to the budget cutter. 
</P>
<P>
The second principle is based on the fact that America competes in an 
increasingly global marketplace. Government spending is now dominated by 
outlays that promote consumption. Very small portions of the federal budget are 
devoted to investment. A new budget restraint effort should focus on cutting 
items that do not promote a stronger economy. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of these two principles, we can identify numerous candidates for 
budget cutting. Because conservatives are often criticized for beginning their 
search for budget cuts with Social Security, Medicare, and other 
"entitlements," let us save them for last. 
</P>
<P>
We can start by identifying low-priority subsidies to business. This notion 
will shock some conservatives who always assume that the term subsidies must be 
preceded by the word farm. The fact is that a variety of federal agencies award 
credit subsidies to a relatively few lucky enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Selective Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
Government credit is provided at interest rates below those that the Treasury 
pays for the money it borrows -- and often substantially lower than the 
interest rates charged to unsubsidized borrowers (the rest of us). Federal 
agencies providing these goodies include the Rural Electrification 
Administration (which has run out of farmers who do not have electricity), the 
Export-Import Bank (which subsidizes foreign companies competing against 
American firms), the Small Business Administration (which picks lucky smaller 
companies) and the Department of Commerce (which picks larger firms). 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural price supports, a multibillion-dollar annual drain on the 
Treasury, are justified by the plight of the family farm. However, most of the 
benefits of the Agriculture Department's largess go to the largest, wealthiest 
farmers. Supporting farm prices gives special advantage to the largest farms 
whose low costs arise from economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate for budget cutting is subsidies awarded by the Department of 
Labor, such as those provided by the Davis-Bacon Act. A vestige of the Great 
Depression, this law increases the cost of government construction projects by 
setting a floor under, rather than a ceiling over, costs. It requires the 
secretary of labor to determine the level of construction wage rates that 
"prevail" in the area of any government-financed project. The government can 
award contracts only to companies that pay those "prevailing" wages. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor has been known to use the Pittsburgh area's high wage 
levels to set the standard for rural Appalachia. Ditto for using Boston's high 
levels in rural Maine. Where the department does not have its own data, it has 
used union wage scales. 
</P>
<P>
No analysis of budget cutting would be complete without special attention to 
the Pentagon. The truly large examples of waste do not include the hammer 
purchased for $125 but are the multimillion-dollar weapons that Congress 
regularly adds to the military budget in order to favor the constituencies of a 
few powerful members. Paying retirement benefits to healthy 38-year-olds is an 
example of both fiscal and economic waste. So is the congressional requirement 
for the military to do the equivalent of "carrying coals to Newcastle." Our 
European bases are required to stockpile U.S.-mined coal even though the local 
product is much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
We have saved the biggest targets for budget cuts for last -- the entitlements. 
This category is supported by arguably the most politically powerful group in 
Washington -- the American Assn. of Retired People. Although howls of outrage 
are heard every time the point is made, public policy treats senior citizens 
better than "junior citizens." The average worker is not fully protected 
against inflation, but every Social Security recipient is. Adjusting benefits 
by less than the full cost of living -- a "diet" COLA (cost of living 
allowance) would save the Treasury billions. 
</P>
<P>
The typical Social Security recipient did not pay for the bulk of his or her 
monthly check (even when the employer contribution is included, plus interest). 
The largest part of the monthly benefit is a gift from the working generation. 
Like other gifts, it should be fully taxable. If it were, low-income Social 
Security recipients would not pay any federal income tax, but middle and upper 
income beneficiaries would. 
</P>
<P>
The potential budget cuts presented here are meant to whet the appetite for a 
tough-minded review of all federal spending. So long as the federal budget 
remains a mechanism for converting private investment into publicly sponsored 
consumption, tax increases are hardly the desirable response to our budget 
deficit woes.

ARCO'S QUICK PROFIT IN ITS SALE OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY IS BAD NEWS FOR THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must also echo Representative Elton Gallegly's sentiments ("Siemens Wins 
Bidding for Pioneering Arco Solar Unit") that the sale of Atlantic Richfield 
Company's Arco Solar Inc. to Siemens of West Germany is not "in the best 
interests of the country's economy or national defense." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, we are not only talking about U.S. technology that can positively 
build the U.S. competitive edge, provide reliable domestic energy, lower 
environmental degradation, strengthen national security, lessen Third World 
debt and aid the U.S. balance of trade. We are also talking about technology 
that John Q. Public has helped pay for via federal and state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on energy issues is increasing rapidly because of all its 
geopolitical, economic and environmental baggage: global warming, oil spills, 
our growing reliance on imported oil, the increasing cost of imported oil ($40 
billion to $50 billion er year), projected energy price increases and the 
battle over cleaning up urban air. We can't lose sight that photovoltaics (and 
solar energy technology in general) can help tremendously in providing 
solutions to these problems. 
</P>
<P>
Inefficient energy use wastes at least one-twelfth of the gross national 
product of the United States. If the United States were as energy-efficient as 
Western Europe, we could save $200 billion a year in energy costs. If we 
selected the best energy buys until the year 2000, we could save several 
trillion dollars -- enough, in principle, to pay off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Japan and Germany surpassed the United States in photovoltaic 
research. Exxon spent twice as much money (over $1 billion) cleaning up the 
Alaskan oil spill as the federal government has spent, in total, on 
photovoltaic research and development. 
</P>
<P>
While photovoltaics is not the only solution to our energy and environmental 
problems, it should be considered a major contender. Americans cannot afford to 
let their investments in photovoltaic development slip away.

WHEN THE WORLD WENT BACK TO WAR;

<P>
ONLY ONE MAN WANTED TO IGNITE WORLD WAR II

<P>
The war that broke out on Sept. 1, 1939, was a war almost no one wanted. In 
1914 cheering crowds had thronged the streets of every European capital as the 
mobilization posters went up and the reservists marched to the railroad 
stations garlanded with flowers. There were few flowers in 1939. Too many 
wreaths had been laid on too many soldiers' graves in the years since the 
Armistice for Europeans to accept the return of war with anything but dread and 
foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
Only one European really wanted war: Adolf Hitler. For him World War I had been 
"the supreme experience," as he wrote in "Mein Kampf," and his political life 
had been a struggle to win vengeance for the defeat Germany suffered in 1918. 
He knew exactly who the victims of his vengeance were to be: the Jews, of 
course, because their "international conspiracy" had been the cause of 
Germany's defeat. But their ultimate fate was reserved for the future. In 1939 
his immediate targets were the people of the East who had profited from 
Germany's defeat, to found states on territory that had belonged to the German 
or Austrian emperors -- the Poles and Czechs. He had finished the Czechs in 
March, when half the country had been made a German "protectorate" and the 
other half turned into a puppet state. By August he was determined to finish 
the Poles -- at the price of war if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Our enemies" -- he meant Britain and France -- "are small fry. I saw them at 
Munich," he told his service chiefs at Berchtesgaden on Aug. 22. Yet that did 
not mean he was prepared to risk invading Poland if the British and French 
could bring Soviet Russia into a war against him. The British and French even 
then had delegates in Moscow, seeking an anti-German alliance. Fortunately for 
him, Britain and France could offer Josef Stalin nothing he wanted -- no direct 
military aid, not even assurance that the Poles would let the Red Army into its 
territory to confront the Wehrmacht. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler, on the other hand, had much to offer the Russians -- a nonaggression 
pact and, as a direct bribe, an agreement to carve up Eastern Europe after 
Poland had been beaten. By the time he met his generals and admirals at 
Berchtesgaden he knew the nonaggression pact was in the bag. Even as he spoke 
in an atmosphere heavy with apprehension -- the German admirals were "deep in 
gloom" at the prospect of confronting the Royal Navy -- he was awaiting word 
from his foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, that the Russians were ready 
to become active allies. 
</P>
<P>
Von Ribbentrop had flown to Moscow on Aug. 23, was met at the airport by a band 
playing the German national anthem under a display of swastika flags -- 
borrowed from a film studio where an anti-Nazi film had just been made. He was 
then driven to a villa next to where British and French delegates were vainly 
trying to persuade the Russians they were worthwhile allies. Shortly afterward 
he found himself in Vyacheslav M. Molotov's office in the Kremlin. Stalin 
entered. Von Ribbentrop was the first minister of a foreign government he had 
ever met, and their talks were the first diplomatic negotiations he had ever 
conducted. He nevertheless dominated discussions from the first moment. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin struck out the effusive preamble to the treaty Von Ribbentrop had 
written. "After six years of shoveling mountains of cow dung over each other," 
Prof. Donald Watt records (he also records that Stalin's language was "much 
coarser" in the original), "they could not suddenly go public with this kind of 
profession of eternal friendship." That settled, Von Ribbentrop laid down the 
secret terms. Poland was to be cut in half, Germany to have the west, Russia 
the east. Stalin insisted on having Latvia as well as Estonia, and a free hand 
toward Finland (which he would invade the coming November). Finally, he 
announced that he wanted the Bessarabian province of Romania. Hitler, by 
telephone, agreed to everything. In the early morning, Aug. 24, the pact was 
signed, to come into effect immediately. Toasts were drunk -- by Von Ribbentrop 
to Stalin, by Stalin to the absent Hitler. The first shots of World War II were 
as good as fired. 
</P>
<P>
They were actually fired a week later -- not in battle but in an act of murder. 
Hitler had got his preconditions for war in Moscow. What he then needed was a 
pretext. Since the Poles were unlikely to attack him, he decided to manufacture 
one. At Gleiwitz in German Silesia, just across the border from Poland, the 
German post office operated a radio transmitter beaming anti-Polish broadcasts 
across the frontier. Hitler's SS had decided that a simulated Polish attack on 
the transmitter would persuade the world press that an act of aggression had 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 30, SS men arrested a local resident, Franz Honiok, 41, an 
agricultural-machinery salesman who had a record of sympathizing with Poland -- 
not uncommon in a border area where nationalities intermingled. On Aug. 31 an 
SS doctor gave him an anesthetic injection; he was then taken to the Gleiwitz 
transmitter and shot dead, his body left on the ground as evidence of a Polish 
raid. Two other corpses were dumped nearby. Never identified, they are believed 
to have been those of inmates of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, after news of the Gleiwitz incident had been made public, the 
Wehrmacht crossed the Polish frontier on three broad fronts of attack and 
headed for Warsaw. The Poles were ready, but no amount of preparation could 
equip them to stay the German advance. The Germans went to war with 60 
divisions of troops, 2,500 tanks, 2,000 aircraft. Poland's 500 obsolete 
aircraft were almost destroyed the first day, often on the ground. Its 30 
divisions of soldiers were old-fashioned marching infantry. Poland had almost 
no tanks at all. Though it is not true that it sent cavalry to charge tanks, 
its best troops were indeed cavalry and the Polish cavalry did charge to death 
against overwhelming German firepower. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles managed to make one stand outside Warsaw, on the little River Bzura 
on Sept. 10. By Sept. 17, when the Red Army appeared at their rear, the Polish 
army had been beaten. Its remnants went on fighting bravely until Oct. 6 -- 
almost as long as the British and French the following year in the Battle of 
France. Then they accepted surrender -- the prelude to five years of occupation 
that would leave one-sixth of the population dead. 
</P>
<P>
I visited Gleiwitz -- part of Poland now, as a result of the Yalta agreement -- 
last month. The radio transmitter is still there; so is the building where 
Honiok's body was dumped. I visited the banks of the Bzura, talked to villagers 
making hay in the water meadows and saw the overgrown graveyard where the 
German dead of battle are buried. And I visited the shrine of the Black Madonna 
at Czestochowa where, amid all the other symbols of Poland's national survival, 
they commemorate warriors who did not give up fighting in 1939 -- those who 
found a way to die as pilots in the Battle of Britain, as sailors in the Battle 
of the Atlantic, as tankers in Normandy, as paratroopers at Arnhem, above all 
as infantrymen on the slopes of Monte Cassino in Italy -- today almost as 
important a shrine to Poles as Czestochowa itself. 
</P>
<P>
I remember Poles in England from my wartime childhood, fighter pilots from a 
nearby air base. Clearly enough, too, I remember the outbreak of war in 1939. 
Like the Poles, we had been prepared. The previous year there had been the 
evacuation because of the Munich crisis, which for children meant being bundled 
up without warning and deposited with strangers in the countryside, safe from 
the bombing which was expected on London. In between there had been other 
excitements -- the raising of the barrage balloon at the bottom of our London 
garden, tests of air-raid sirens, a warbling for the approach of bombers, a 
level note for the "all clear" and the issue of gas masks. 
</P>
<P>
What my mother, with two infants and a baby in arms, can have thought as she 
fitted the rubber pig-snouts round those young faces defies imagination. We 
loved it. Gas masks were fun. Air-raid sirens were fun. Even barrage balloons, 
though they made my younger sister cry, I thought fun. Indeed I thought the 
whole war fun, from begining to end. I particularly enjoyed the begining. There 
was a real evacuation, not just the short-lived practice of Munich. We went to 
the West Country, far from London, to a new house, to new schools. We saw 
entirely new things, all of them entirely more interesting than anything that 
went on in our London streets. In the summer of 1939, when Poles and Germans 
were fighting each other in hayfields beside the Bzura, I was learning to help 
a farmer make hay in the meadow behind our new house, following a horse-drawn 
hayrack and looking forward to supper of farm-fresh eggs and clotted cream. 
Polish families had already begun to tighten belts, as a preliminary to a 
starvation winter. I remember no winter at all of 1939, or of any of the six 
years the war lasted. We were happy, well-fed and safe in our country refuge. 
That it could be different anywhere else I had no inkling. 
</P>
<P>
Today, of course, I know otherwise. My visit to Poland last month took me not 
only to Gleiwitz, Czestochowa and the Bzura but to Auschwitz. It took me to 
Warsaw, to the rebuilt Old City destroyed block by block by the Germans during 
the uprising of 1944, when a quarter-million Poles died among the ruins. It 
took me to East Berlin, to the remains of the Reichstag and Hitler's 
chancellery, where his will determined that Europe should undergo the agony of 
a Second World War. On Sept. 3, 1939, the day Britain honored its guarantee to 
Poland and declared war, British aircraft scattered 6 million leaflets over 
Germany; they read, "Your rulers have condemned you to the massacres, 
privations and miseries of a war they cannot win." 
</P>
<P>
Hitler must have sneered. How little can those who wrote the words have guessed 
how exactly they had predicted the consequences. By the time the war was over, 
7 million Germans would be dead, their country occupied and divided, their 
capital lost and every one of their great cities burnt out to the heart.

COLOMBIA UNDER SIEGE: FIGHTING NARCO TERRORISM

Colombia is set for a blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers have begun a merciless and brutal retaliation for the 
government's crackdown, and the country is braced for many more deaths 
following a week of mass arrests, potential extraditions and seizures of 
property belonging to the drug kingpins. In 48 hours, the narcos hit a judge, a 
senator who was also a leading presidential candidate and a state police chief. 
In those two days they struck at the heart of three of the country's most 
important institutions -- the judiciary, the Congress and the police. 
</P>
<P>
Under siege, the narcos now have good reason for violence. The theater has been 
forever altered. Its audience -- an entire country in pain -- holds its breath. 
Gone are the days when Pablo Escobar aspired to a seat in the country's 
Congress or Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha appeared on national television giving a 
tour on horseback of his fabulous mansion. Today, these men flee from one 
estate to another, surrounded by bodyguards who bristle with weaponry and 
walkie-talkies as they patrol a 25-mile perimeter around their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of kings of the world, they live a miserable life," said Colombia's 
leading news weekly, Semana. "The Joe Kennedy dream is finished for them. Their 
sons will never be able to clear their names with their millions. They are 
corralled. The only exit they see is to destabilize the system, create total 
chaos to force the government to abdicate and offer dialogue, legalization, 
amnesty, whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Is this the turning point? Will Colombia finally defeat the Mafia? Can 
Colombians maintain this renewed will to fight? These are the questions I have 
heard over and over since the Aug. 18 assassination of Liberal presidential 
candidate Luis Carlos Galan. 
</P>
<P>
There is no single answer. 
</P>
<P>
In Colombia there is widespread skepticism. Since the traffickers killed 
Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984, Colombians have been shocked by 
a series of horrifying murders: an attorney general, a leading newspaper 
editor, the head of the major leftist political party, a state governor, a 
Supreme Court justice. With each act, the public has grown more afraid and the 
government has recommitted itself to the war against narcotics trafficking. But 
nothing has really changed. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the killing of Galan nine days ago has triggered an 
unprecedented outpouring of public support for the government. "If they want to 
bring in U.S. Marines, we would say yes," said Enrique Santos, columnist for El 
Tiempo, the country's largest daily newspaper. "If they want to establish a 
death penalty, we would say yes. If they want to call for indiscriminate 
extradition, we would say yes. But the government has to act very quickly 
because this kind of timing doesn't last forever." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Colombia is in a state of war that affects each of its 31 million 
inhabitants. The number of deaths has surpassed 20,000 since 1986. Lists of 
victims marked for murder proliferate. Until last week, judges were on strike 
because they could not find protection from a campaign of terror directed 
against them. The criminal justice system is paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Sectors of the army and police have been penetrated by the narcos. The capacity 
for corruption by the traffickers and their infinite savagery have no 
geographical or ideological limits. Their endless wealth can buy anything or 
anybody: mercenaries -- believed to be Israeli and British -- to train their 
private armies; airplane refueling rights from Nicaragua's government; 
collaboration with Cuban officials; gracious support from the prime minister of 
the Bahamas; partnership with Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
That it is a war, there is no doubt. Neither is there doubt that it is an 
international war, or that it is an unconventional war. But there is a 
fundamental mistake in the way this war is defined. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian case shows clearly that it is not "a war against drug 
trafficking." Rather, it is a war of the drug traffickers against every 
institution, individual or group that dares to threaten or even attempts to 
threaten their interests. To be more precise -- and as incredible as it seems 
-- if we believe reports from Colombian officials, the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Agency, Interpol and others involved in the battle, this war is sustained by a 
force of two: Escobar and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
These men, who head the infamous Medellin Cartel, appear to be responsible for 
80% of the cocaine trade to the United States and nearly 100% of the recent 
assassinations in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, President Virgilio Barco and the entire country of Colombia 
have declared war against drugs. But I see it as a war by two brilliant thugs 
who, drunk with the power of money, have come to believe they are untouchable 
and omnipotent. "Poderoso caballero es Don Dinero," goes a Spanish proverb -- 
"A powerful gentleman is Mr. Money." 
</P>
<P>
Any action to stop them has triggered a simple and straightforward response: 
murder. Throughout a decade they watched their business soar. More ranches, 
more planes, more cars, more power. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists toured the homes seized from some of the narcos last week and 
"found themselves shaking their heads over the displays of wealth," according 
to one correspondent's report. But these men didn't build their own homes, nor 
do they maintain them, or pilot their own planes or drive their own cars. 
</P>
<P>
How many workers were hired to hang the silk that covers the walls of 
Rodriguez's house? How many maids had the pleasure of polishing real gold 
faucets in the servants' bathrooms? How many guests admired the naked women on 
Rodriguez's imported Italian toilet paper? 
</P>
<P>
Together they constitute the other aspect of Colombia's war: the "little 
people" who share in the business that has corrupted a nation. How extensive 
are their numbers? According to Ethan Nadelmann, a political scientist at 
Princeton University, behind every 300 Latin American cocaine exporters in 1986 
were 220,000 coca farmers, 74,000 processors, 7,400 transporters and 1,333 
refiners. 
</P>
<P>
By now, even as the numbers at the top of the pyramid remain the same, its base 
has grown as the cocaine traffic expands and the country's economy continues to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The kingpins once reveled in their image as Robin Hoods, building 
neighborhoods, funding hospitals, providing jobs, sponsoring soccer teams. 
True, that image has been tarnished as their brutality spreads. But make no 
mistake -- for thousands of Colombians who receive nothing from their 
government, these men continue to fulfill basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
There is a level of society in Colombia lower than most people in the United 
States could imagine. It is composed of young men and teen-agers virtually 
created by poverty. Misery is the only constant in their lives. They know 
nothing of a moral world, of ethics or values. Daily survival is their only 
creed. For them, the life of a political candidate, an attorney general or a 
journalist can mean $1,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Without such desperate people, the Escobars and the Rodriguezes would not have 
been able to terrorize a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Poor people and drug traffickers form an alliance that no campaign can break. 
Even if Escobar and Rodriguez are arrested and extradited -- a remote 
possibility at best -- the lucrative nature of narcotics and the lure of easy 
money will continue to enslave thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, the most that can be hoped for at this point is an end to the 
savagery and murder propagated by the dementia of the current kingpins. Nab 
them and perhaps fewer of the country's leaders will die. But the business will 
go on unchanged because there is nothing to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
Governments desperate to destroy the drug trade need to recognize they have 
been fighting on the wrong battlefield. An unconventional war calls for 
unconventional solutions. One way to start would be to help drug-producing 
nations turn their economies around.

WESTERN WORLD TILTS LEFT, LEAVING CONSERVATIVE CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Report and Business and Public Affairs Fortnightly.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for Americans who have been monitoring Britain, Japan and West 
Germany in the financial pages to start watching these countries' elections and 
opinion polls. Modern Western politics is arguably in its first megacycle; 
trends in London, Toronto and Tokyo -- places increasingly disenchanted with 
conservatism -- may also signal the political future of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising parallels have developed in recent years in the politics of the 
Group of Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Britain, Japan, West 
Germany, France, Canada and Italy. The result so far has been the West's first 
international political cycle: an unprecedented conservative coloration on the 
last 10 years of politics and policy-making in the world's principal economies. 
But the next cycle -- possibly already visible in 1989 elections and surveys -- 
could easily move more to the center-left as a reaction to the conservative 
excesses of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is intriguing. The fashion of the late 1980s has been to emphasize 
the growing international sway of market economics. Yet at the grass roots of 
G-7 nations a different politics is catching hold. From Canada to Japan, from 
Edinburgh, Scotland, to Edinburg, Texas, emerging economic and environmental 
issues tilt mildly left instead of right. 
</P>
<P>
The logic of yet another new political tide in the 1990s depends on what's 
still too little understood about the 1980s -- its unique success as the great 
conservative governmental and philosophic heyday of the late 20th Century. 
Other conservative periods of the postwar era were brief. The late-1950s 
convergence of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle in France, Konrad 
Adenauer in West Germany and Harold MacMillan in Britain -- a World War II 
memory lane -- was quickly overwhelmed by the youthful liberal thrust of the 
early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s, by contrast, were an ideological cavalry charge. Conservative 
governments held power in most G-7 countries. In contrast to the placid 
Eisenhower era, conservatism has been aggressive enough to exert ideological 
gravity even on nominally leftist regimes such as the French presidency of 
Francois Mitterand and the current Labor Party governments of Australia and New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the conservative political parties and governments 
dominating the G-7 has been unprecedented. In some cases, cross-fertilization 
of strategies and policies extended to assistance at election time. President 
George Bush's May visit to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the most recent 
example, but Ronald Reagan helped British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 
the 1982 Falklands crisis and did everything but campaign for the Canadian 
conservatives just before the 1988 election. The Japanese government provided 
important 1988 election-year help to the Bush campaign by supporting the 
dollar. Chicago economist David Hale even suggested, tongue in cheek, that the 
Bank of Japan should have had to register as a GOP political-action committee. 
Indeed, between 1985 and 1989, cooperative management of the world economy was 
what the G-7 became known for. 
</P>
<P>
Without the participants' common conservative politics, it probably wouldn't 
have worked. But leaders of G-7 countries shared similar national 
constituencies in business and finance, as well as commitments to tax reduction 
and deregulation. The wide success of this agenda, coupled with the longevity 
and sweep of conservative political control in most of the G-7, supports the 
thesis of the modern West's first political megacycle. 
</P>
<P>
But the fuller test of developing transnational political patterns may be 
whether the G-7 can dance a two-step -- first one way, then another. For the 
moment, at least, the evidence drifting in from 1989 elections and opinion 
surveys does suggest a countertrend: G-7 countries, having moved to the right 
together during the 1980s, are now moving together back to the center -- and 
possibly beyond. 
</P>
<P>
This reaction is most vivid in the nations with the world's leading stock 
markets -- the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan -- where rousing 
economic successes of the 1980s have concentrated benefits among a fifth or a 
tenth of the population and left others grumbling about declining "quality of 
life" measurements and rising tax burdens. While top income tax brackets have 
been reduced, regressive taxes have been imposed on the general public -- new 
national consumer taxes in Japan and Canada, Britain's resented "poll tax" (a 
new head tax to replace local property taxes) and rising U.S. Social Security 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
This is the dark side of conservative politics, and signs of a voter revolt 
have been multiplying. France swung back to the Socialists in 1988, who 
promptly reimposed a controversial wealth tax. Meanwhile, in spring, 1989, 
flashing electoral red lights appeared for Thatcher and her Conservative Party, 
largely as a result of public anger over such measures as the poll tax and 
proposed privatization of water and electricity, coupled with reforms that 
voters believed might cripple the popular National Health Service. In June, an 
increasingly revitalized Labor Party beat the Conservatives in Britain's 
European Parliament elections by a stunning 40.1% to 34.7%. Since then, summer 
polls have shown Labor leading the Tories by up to 15 points. Large majorities 
say the Conservatives favor the rich, and there's growing belief that Labor may 
just have a chance to win the next general election -- expected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1988, polls in Japan were also charting a potential revolution -- an 
increasing belief that middle-class society was coming unglued. In one 
government-sponsored poll, 74% called the system unfair while more than half 
complained of a widening income gap between ordinary people and those making 
huge profits in soaring stock and real estate markets. When the 
conservative-run Liberal Democratic Party government cut income tax brackets 
and imposed a 3% consumption tax, voters began rebelling. 
</P>
<P>
Scandals also diminished LDP popularity. In late July, just before the Japan 
Socialist Party won its stunning victory in elections for half the nation's 
upper legislative house, the weekly Economist described the Socialist policy as 
"pledged to scrap the 3% consumption tax, raising the cash instead by soaking 
the rich, probably through taxes on capital gains." Full legislative elections 
are expected this year, and LDP control of the government is likely to give way 
to a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
North of the border in Canada, Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is in 
trouble over plans to bolster revenue with a new 9% value-added tax. Polls show 
70% voter disapproval. Some Conservative members of Parliament threaten 
opposition, and the latest Canadian Gallup polls, released in mid-August, show 
the Liberal Party opening up a big 43%-to-27% lead over the Conservatives, with 
the left-tilting New Democratic Party pulling 27%. No new elections are 
required until 1993, however. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's governing Christian Democrats are also shaky, and if these 
various national trends don't reverse, some observers project that only two or 
three of the G-7 governments will still be in conservative hands by 1992. Of 
course, even many Americans who acknowledge the political shifts elsewhere 
doubt they have relevance for this country -- the other big question. 
Stipulating that the United States was the principal engine of the global 
conservative trend of the 1980s, can the process work in reverse? Can 
countertrends visible in Europe and Japan jump the oceans to Long Island and 
the San Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Bush's Administration is far more popular than the other conservative 
governments in the G-7, while the Democrats have so far been a less aggressive 
and articulate counterforce than some of the other opposition parties. However, 
even in the United States, Bush Administration high ratings come largely from 
success in international affairs, with the President drawing much lower ratings 
for handling the economy or domestic policy. Democratic House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley has just begun expressing concern about "the alienation and separation of 
economic classes in this country." As a new Democratic theme this would follow 
the emerging G-7 model for successful opposition parties in a world of 
increasing political interdependence.

'REAL BOOKS' FOR CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS: SCHOOLS ALSO NEED REAL-WORLD SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Marsden, Nancy Marsden has been an elementary teacher in Beverly Hills 
and Los Angeles for 14 years. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
We are in the midst of a revolution -- a quiet, intellectual revolution 
spinning out dramatic insights into how the brain works, how we acquire 
language and how we construct meaning in our lives . . . . -- The 1987 
California English Language Arts Framework 
</P>
<P>
The literature-based reading program being introduced in California schools 
this fall, reflecting a revolutionary trend in schools nationwide, will 
fundamentally alter the way children learn to read, write and spell. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, literature-based instruction heralds a renaissance of the 
love of reading. The colorful new readers are filled with classic literature 
instead of prose hacked out at publishing houses -- progress, by anyone's 
standard. After a six-year transition, all readers may become obsolete. 
Classrooms of the future will be filled with what youngsters call "real books." 
</P>
<P>
Parents may be surprised to find no spelling or grammar texts in their kids' 
backpacks. Phonics and skill instruction will once again take a back seat, 
along with paper-and-pencil drill, objective tests and detailed record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
California's new English Language Arts Framework, cornerstone of the program, 
is a broad philosophical document. In practice, interpretation will vary from 
district to district, teacher to teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the classroom of the future will be an active place where reading, 
speaking and writing are the main occupations. Traditional reading groups -- 
high, medium and low -- are on the way out. Children will read self-selected 
books, books chosen by the teacher to meet individual needs and "core 
literature," selected by district committees. They will respond to reading 
through a wealth of language-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
The new wisdom is that reading skills should be taught in context, only as 
needed; likewise for grammar and spelling, 50% of which will optimally be 
culled from readings and student writing. Any loss in continuity from year to 
year is deemed negligible next to the benefit of making skills relevant. 
According to the latest research, mastering spelling words in isolation has 
little relation to becoming a good speller; grammar is best absorbed through 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
These reforms represent a swing of the pendulum away from the hyper-rationalism 
of the '70s, when behavioral scientists tried to take the guesswork out of 
teaching by quantifying reading into hundreds of small, measurable skills, 
ushering in one of the most tedious and compulsive eras in schoolhouse history. 
Long-term results were disappointing -- and little wonder, since skills had 
become an end in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A pivotal 1985 national study, "On Becoming a Nation of Readers," revealed that 
70% of the reading period in elementary classrooms was being spent on rote 
"seatwork" -- filling in blanks and circling or underlining answers on 
mind-numbing skill sheets. 
</P>
<P>
The backlash now sweeping across the nation is founded on a radically different 
assumption: Given meaningful experiences in reading and writing, the majority 
of children will become fluent readers without intensive, skill-based 
instruction. Just as figure-eights and compulsories do not constitute ice 
skating, mastering a sequence of skills does not necessarily add up to fluent 
reading. Thus, the new framework states that while some phonics is necessary in 
the primary grades, children learn to read primarily by reading. 
</P>
<P>
As anyone who has marveled at a preschooler reading a favorite storybook will 
tell you, children who love books and hear stories frequently can acquire 
reading naturally, just as they acquire language. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many teachers are concerned that the pendulum may swing too far. 
They argue that skill-based instruction in phonics, reading comprehension, 
spelling and grammar are essential to a balanced language-arts program. Because 
children have more than one learning style, effective teachers include varied 
strategies in their bags of tricks. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the issue boils down to a conflict between two learning modalities of 
the human brain. The '70s were dominated by a linear, analytic style 
characteristic of the left brain. The current program leans toward a holistic, 
whole-word approach. Most teachers tend to be eclectics, recognizing that both 
modes of learning are native to human intelligence and thus have a place in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
One controversial feature of the program requires that all students be exposed 
to the core literature, whether they can decode it or not. For years, 
individualized instruction -- assigning books according to ability levels -- 
has been standard practice. Now, flying a banner called "equal access," 
proponents argue that all children need an opportunity to grapple with 
age-appropriate books and themes. Teachers and peers may read aloud to low 
students, who will learn by "following along." 
</P>
<P>
Interpretations vary on how much classroom time should be spent on whole-group 
reading. There is also debate on what innovative techniques teachers can use to 
meet individual needs of students without assigning workbooks and readers at 
their functional level. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain. Never has a program demanded more from teachers, who are 
gearing up to make literature-based instruction work. Extensive retraining 
would be desirable, but in some California districts, in part due to budget 
deficits, in-service training has been insufficient. California's new framework 
is idealistic in the best sense: It seeks to help students "unlock the doors of 
language and discover the best that human beings have thought, written and 
spoken." Since the benefits of producing "a nation of readers" are profound, in 
this age of TV, movies and video games, there is all the more reason to pause 
at the outset and take stock. 
</P>
<P>
A global reading program in a state as diverse as California is best 
incorporated with balance and moderation. A renaissance is needed, not a 
revolution. Educators can ensure its success by embracing innovative strategies 
while still maintaining a commitment to structure, defined skill objectives and 
academic continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should Sacramento delude the public that pedagogic reforms will solve the 
crisis in our schools. The mediocre results of even excellent state programs is 
proof that methodology isn't the issue. Broken families, poor discipline, 
poverty, transiency, apathy and lack of follow-through at home, a multilingual 
population, low funding for education and the resulting overcrowded classrooms 
and underpaid teachers are the real issues. 
</P>
<P>
These conditions undermine the best methods and the best teachers. In this 
context, new teaching methods and texts can have little effect without 
attention to real-world solutions: smaller classes, more help for 
limited-English speakers, clear-cut standards for grade-level promotion, home 
involvement, tougher use of review and dismissal procedures to remove weak 
teachers and administrators, better pay to attract top educators to California, 
a uniform statewide curriculum to meet the needs of a transient population and 
common-sense teaching strategies.

'MOTOR-VOTER' REGISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is written in response to the letter from Ruth Coffey (Aug. 8) 
regarding the proposed "motor-voter" bill (S-874). Her description of voting as 
"not only an honor but a sacred trust" is commendable and it is our goal to 
inspire that sense of duty and participation in all citizens. It is also our 
goal to ensure that the mechanics of registering and voting are designed to 
make the process as simple as possible without jeopardizing the integrity of 
the system. That is why the League of Women Voters is a sponsor of the 
"motor-voter" bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Coffey expressed a deep concern about the possibility of fraud in 
describing the legislation as "a plan to automatically register people to vote 
when they renew their driver's license." The facts are that "motor voter" does 
not automatically register people to vote; it automatically serves as an 
application to register to vote. Safeguards are included to ensure that only 
those eligible to vote will register to vote. The legislation also provides 
penalties for those who fraudulently register. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 39% of the population moves every two years and a large 
percentage of registered movers forget to re-register at their new addresses. 
In the process of establishing a new residence, movers are in touch with many 
agencies . . . utilities, the post office and the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
In addition to the DMV, the "motor-voter" bill permits expanded registration 
opportunities at other state, local, and federal agencies, including public 
high schools and colleges. The Los Angeles League of Women Voters is currently 
working with the Los Angeles Unified School District in a school-based program 
to register students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Voter participation is the necessary foundation for a healthy and sound 
democracy and yet of the world's major democratic systems, the United States is 
dead last in voter participation. 
</P>
<P>
Each state determines its own registration laws and procedures. As a result, 
access to voting varies widely from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration must not be a barrier to voting; voting is a right, not a 
privilege granted to those most tenacious in pursuing registration. The League 
of Women Voters believes that S-874 is an excellent first step in providing a 
national registration procedure that will help in getting voters back to the 
polls.

MALCOLM FORBES' BIRTHDAY BASH

I opened my Sunday paper and thought they had delivered a copy of USA Today by 
mistake. Since when does a wealthy man's extravagant birthday party deserve 
front-page coverage in The Times? I found your choice of a photo, showing 
Malcolm Forbes and Elizabeth Taylor fronting two black men dressed as Nubian 
guards (or slaves), in extremely poor taste. Maybe the picture helped you sell 
newspapers. Mine went immediately in the garbage where it belonged.

THOSE LONGER LOTTO ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as everyone expected, and feared, the California Lottery keeps escalating 
the hysteria level to get more and more people to play. The curious thing about 
the latest move of the California Lottery Commission, however, is that in order 
to get more people to spend more money on the lottery, the commission is making 
it harder to win. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, players in the Lotto game had to pick the correct six numbers 
from a field of 49 to win the big Saturday prize. Then the commission added a 
Wednesday drawing. Now it is increasing the field from 49 numbers to 53. It 
seems that a prize of $5 million or $10 million is just not sufficient to get 
jaded players to play enough. By increasing the odds, the commission lessens 
the chance of someone winning the Wednesday or Saturday drawing. Thus the prize 
will roll over from one lottery night to the next and build in size. This is 
necessary "to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game," a commission official 
says. Some logic. How big is big enough? Fifty million dollars? A hundred 
million? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to soften the criticism of making the long Lotto odds even longer, and 
ostensibly to give players all sorts of options, there will be new games that 
allow people to have a greater chance of winning smaller prizes. Even so, the 
odds of winning anything at all in the lottery will increase from 1 in 54 to 1 
in 67. The odds on catching the big Lotto prize will go from 1 in 14 million to 
1 in 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
The frantic lottery ads still tout the benefits to California education from 
playing the lottery. But Neal R. Peirce was correct when he wrote in the 
National Journal earlier this year that state lotteries have become "a massive, 
regressive debilitating tax -- especially on lower-income people." Peirce 
proposed a number of actions to bring lotteries under control that should be 
considered by the California Legislature. One is to ban lottery advertising. 
Another is to cap the size of jackpots. A third is to limit the proliferation 
of lottery outlets, such as the mini-lottery terminals established in some 
California supermarket checkout lines. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery is a sordid adjunct to public policy. Every time the state cranks 
up the hysteria to get more people to play, it becomes just that much more 
sordid.

MALCOLM FORBES' BIRTHDAY BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Malcolm Forbes article (Aug. 20) points up the area of taxation most in 
need of reform -- corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every doctor, every lawyer, everyone who can, incorporates. Why? 
Because it is infinitely more advantageous than being taxed as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
Time for Congress to start considering stepping on some corporate toes. A 
system that (would allow) Forbes to deduct his party expenses but doesn't allow 
an individual deduction for an IRA (let alone party expenses) is nowhere near 
being equitable.

THE ARMY IS A JUGGERNAUT, NOT A LIGHT BRIGADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY G. SUMMERS JR., Col. Harry Summers Jr. formerly held the Douglas 
MacArthur Chair at the Army War College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why an Army? What does the Army do better than anyone else? For Michael P. W. 
Stone, the new secretary of the Army, those are fundamental questions, for they 
will determine how the Army of the 1990s will be manned, organized, trained and 
equipped. 
</P>
<P>
The missions of the Navy and the Air Force are easily understood. The Navy 
sails and the Air Force flies. While they have their own internal squabbles -- 
among the surface Navy, the "Airedales" and the submariners, for example; or 
among the fighter pilots, the bomber pilots, the transport pilots and, 
increasingly, the silo sitters of our missile forces -- the question of "Why a 
Navy?" or "Why an Air Force?" seldoms arises. The answers are self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
And that's generally true for the Marine Corps as well, now that the drift 
toward "heavying-up" has been reversed and the Marines once again have 
committed themselves to being the nation's expeditionary force, a role for 
which they are particularly well suited. 
</P>
<P>
At one time the Army was the nation's senior service (as the Royal Navy is 
Great Britain's senior service), and everything else existed to bolster and 
support its mission: control of land. As the Navy War College put it in 1942, 
man does not live on the sea or in the air. He lives on land. Therefore control 
of land is war's ultimate aim. 
</P>
<P>
But with the beginning of the Atomic Age the need for armies seemingly 
vanished. Wars would henceforth be fought with nuclear weapons and would be 
over within minutes before armies could even be mobilized. The coup de grace 
was administered by none other than Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Army's greatest 
hero, when he announced his budget-driven strategy of "massive retaliation," in 
which almost total reliance for America's defenses was placed on nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent world events proved this strategy (and the follow-on nuclear-based 
flexible response strategy) nonsensical. The Arab-Israeli wars, the Vietnam 
War, the Sino-Vietnamese war, the Falklands War, the war between Iran and Iraq 
and all the others were fought with ground forces and with conventional, not 
nuclear, weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Given this record, you would think the Army would have regained its preeminent 
position, but that has not been the case. The Army has yet to regain its soul 
and still struggles to define its national defense role. The latest straw it 
has grasped is the light division concept, where combat power and 
sustainability have been sacrificed for rapid movement to world crisis areas. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not what the Army does best. The Marines, with units already afloat 
with the fleet, are much better trained, equipped and deployed for such 
contingencies. And they have the not inconsiderable added advantage of being 
seen by the American people and by potential adversaries as a temporary 
expedient. "Send in the Marines" carries an entirely different 
political-military message than does commitment of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
A clue to what the Army does best was laid out in "Dispatches," Michael Herr's 
outstanding book on the Vietnam War. Describing the Army's 1st Cavalry Division 
relief of the besieged Marines at Khe Sanh, he tells how the division moved 
forward. Slowly, ponderously, it advanced, emplacing its artillery and laying 
out fields of fire at each step. As one step followed the other, it was like 
the juggernaut: not very glamorous, not very exciting, but an absolutely 
inexorable force that could not be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of competing with the Marine Corps by forming light divisions, the Army 
ought to have put its attention and its resources into its heavy forces -- the 
mechanized and armored divisions that the Army alone possesses. The average 
armored or mechanized division's 300 Abrams tanks, 300 Bradley infantry 
fighting vehicles, and the self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzers and multiple 
launch rocket systems of its division artillery provide an awesome array of 
combat power capable of standing toe-to-toe and slugging it out with any enemy 
force in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're not useful in low-intensity conflict," critics complain. That may 
be, but do we really need more divisions for "low-intensity" conflict? When 
what that requires cannot be met by the Marines' three-division expeditionary 
force, or by the Army's Ranger Regiment, or its Special Forces units or 
super-secret anti-terrorist forces, it should be obvious that the conflict is 
no longer "low-intensity." 
</P>
<P>
And when that happens, when it gets too tough for everyone else to handle, 
that's the time to call on the juggernaut, otherwise known as the United States 
Army. Defeating the enemy's land forces in order to break his will to resist 
used to be what the U.S. Army was all about. It's time it once again 
concentrated its resources and attention on that fundamental task.

DEMOCRATS SEE PATH TO LEVERAGE ON TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KUTTNER, Robert Kuttner is economics correspondent of the New 
Republic. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The era of fiscal paralysis will either end next year or the federal budget 
will become a complete fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will soon put the final touches on the 1990 fiscal budget, which 
begins Oct. 1. The 1990 budget is likely to be the last one in which Congress 
and the Administration can meet budget targets of the Gramm-Rudman law through 
a combination of gimmicks, nickle-and-dime revenue raisers and relatively 
painless spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The next budget year -- 1991 -- is supposed to be within $100 billion of 
balance, according to the Gramm-Rudman law. But most experts project that the 
1991 deficit will be as much as $160 billion. And that's assuming no recession. 
</P>
<P>
A $60-billion gap is serious money, even in Washington. The Gramm-Rudman law 
provides that if the budget misses its targets, spending shall be automatically 
cut, half from military outlays and half from domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Reagan and Bush Administrations have played a very effective 
game of chicken with the Democratic Congress. In budget battles of recent 
years, Congress has always blinked first and gone along with something close to 
the Administration blueprint, rather than risk triggering automatic 
Gramm-Rudman cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Reagan and Bush have been forced to take smaller military outlays 
than they wanted, but they have been able to set spending priorities and keep 
the pledge of no new taxes. Democrats willing to risk triggering automatic cuts 
have been tactically isolated within their own party. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, this scenario changes -- for three reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First, a $60-billion gap is too big to make up through fudging. 
</P>
<P>
Second, President Bush, unlike President Reagan, wants to spend some money. 
There is broad public support for more spending on drug eradication, 
environmental cleanup, education, not to mention money that will be spent one 
way or another on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
And third, there is a growing sentiment in Democratic ranks that it's time to 
call the Administration's bluff. 
</P>
<P>
The present budget paralysis was created in 1981, when the original Reagan 
"supply-side" tax cut failed to generate the revenues it promised. Instead, it 
locked the government into a cycle of permanent deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics assumed that starving government was the real goal all along, and a 
number of Reagan's strategists have admitted as much. Whether or not it was 
Reagan's goal, the tactic has worked brilliantly. For almost a decade, 
Democrats have chafed under a steadily tightening fiscal noose. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Democrats in Congress have resisted playing serious chicken with the 
budget. They have not been able to agree on tactics. They have been intimidated 
by the Administration's threat to paint them as the tax-and-spend party. And 
they have assumed that letting the Gramm-Rudman formula substitute for hard 
legislative work would be seen as a congressional failure. 
</P>
<P>
But all of this is changing. It is beginning to occur to prominent Democrats 
that the threat of automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts of $30 billion from defense and 
$30 billion from domestic spending would force George Bush to rescind his 
no-new-taxes pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative is either to give up on issues that Bush really cares about, or 
to make recent budget subterfuges universal and simply place every new spending 
program off budget and take the government deeper into debt. 
</P>
<P>
That is what the Administration did with the savings-and-loan bailout, and that 
is what drug czar William J. Bennett hopes to do to finance his war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But two can play this game. If we can have plentiful off-budget spending to 
bail out banks, or to crack down on crack, then why not off-budget spending for 
housing, or child care, or universal health insurance? 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats would be far better advised to insist on real budget discipline 
by letting the Gramm-Rudman law do its work. They should offer their own set of 
taxing and spending priorities, with necessary new spending financed by 
restoring a progressive tax code. Raising the top tax rate to its 1987 level of 
38% would do most of the job, and it would not touch the pocketbooks of most 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush Administration failed to meet Congress halfway, then reducing 
defense spending by $30 billion and living with another $30 billion in domestic 
cuts would become George Bush's problem. Being an 
education-environment-drug-eradicator President would be out of the question. 
And the generals would suddenly become the Democrats' allies, lobbying for 
taxes rather than cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
The voters, I suspect, would like to see the budget paralysis end, even at the 
price of some new taxes. And they might enjoy seeing the Democrats get up off 
the mat.

POLISH COMMUNIST PARTY WAVES THE WHITE FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL PASSENT, Daniel Passent is deputy editor of Polityka, Poland's 
Communist newspaper. His commentary was supplied by The Guardian.

WARSAW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polish Communists are doing what no Communist Party in the world has ever done 
-- surrendering power, not willingly, but because they must. 
</P>
<P>
The red flag has been fluttering for years atop the Central Committee building 
in Warsaw. Several years ago it was joined by the red and white national flag. 
Now, a white flag of surrender may well be hung. 
</P>
<P>
History is not just. As former Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski has said, 
many Poles, himself included, would still be tending cattle without the party 
and socialism. But today the great majority of the country is not prepared for 
academic debate. They demand change instead. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Solidarity's birth in 1980, the party has been in retreat. The 
Communist manifesto has been shelved and nobody mentions the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. Party newspapers and politicians praise the private and market 
economy instead of the state one, and nobody is fighting the church, Pope or 
religion as "the opium for the masses." 
</P>
<P>
Party instruction books are outdated, especially the chapters on Socialist 
economy, democracy, history -- the Ribbentrop pact, Katyn, the establishment of 
communism in in Poland and the rigged post-war referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological erosion is accompanied by a feeling of political failure and 
frustration -- especially among the activists and full-time party apparatus. 
What the party banned yesterday is reality today. Free play of political 
forces, a nightmare dream of yesterday, is a fact, a reality without free space 
for a Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 members surrendered their party cards this year. Society uses 
the media to criticize what has been the substance of party policy -- the 
one-party system, the "dictatorship of the proletariat," the state economy and 
its tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The party is being associated with all this -- so how can it revive in such a 
situation? The young shun the party and embrace the opposition instead. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from several 30-year-olds given high positions recently, the party is 
getting old. Its average member's age is more than 40, the highest in the 
party's history. 
</P>
<P>
There are universities with thousands of students and only a handful of party 
members among them. In 1980 and 1981, deserting the party was a loud and 
ostentatious affair. Striking Solidarity workers were throwing their party 
cards into buckets. Now the party is disappearing without a whisper. Many party 
members feel they are already a minority. Many went over to Solidarity and the 
workers' party became an organization of directors, managers, officers. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the party is still about 2 million strong. Weak and spent as a 
political force, it is unable to govern without resorting to violence. 
Humiliated and ridiculed by the opposition, it has no energy to react. 
</P>
<P>
The party can no longer be sure of the police and the military. Members cannot 
wheel out any striking "anti-Socialistic element" from the factory. The 
activists -- used to ruling on all levels, from school, factory and county 
offices to government and parliament -- became lazy and frustrated. No wonder, 
when such notorious dissidents as Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron appear on 
television and in parliament instead of being locked in jail as usual and 
Solidarity's Andrzej Wajda presides on the jury of a film festival in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa removes Communists from the government and is packing for his trip 
to the Soviet Union. Soviet spokesmen, instead of protesting, say that the 
Polish government is an internal matter. 
</P>
<P>
What other dangers are there for the party? If it keeps only the defense and 
interior ministries, it may become Walesa's "fig leaf." 
</P>
<P>
Dominated by Solidarity in government, the party may find itself an ornament in 
the process of further dismantling socialism. Either it joins a facade 
coalition or it will have to withdraw from Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government. Too 
weak for an independent existence in opposition, the party is bound to go for 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Ministers, directors, professors, generals, ambassadors, prosecutors, judges, 
editors, members of parliament -- everywhere where decisions were taken, there 
used to be party people. 
</P>
<P>
Now thousands of full-time party apparatchiks must feel threatened, anxious 
about their fate, even their families' safety. Those most frightened fear the 
white terror and remember the crushing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Such an event is unlikely in Poland because Solidarity is a nonviolent 
movement. The Roman Catholic Church's influence is strong and Communist leaders 
here were more moderate then in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
When the leadership opened the doors to democracy, the mighty wind of history 
swept the party away. The latest resolution of the Warsaw party chapter says: 
"The Polish United Workers' Party (the Communists) is being pushed onto the 
margin of political life." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders will be trying to save the party by democratization and evolution 
toward social democracy. The dogmatists may attempt to build a left-wing 
opposition, creating in the process a rift in the party. But they cannot hope 
for any substantial following among the masses, and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski 
has been removing them systematically from the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The left in Poland will not perish completely. Socialism left durable traces in 
people's consciousness. The trend toward re-privatization -- the 
re-establishment of private schools, the rich villas and limousines of the new 
bourgeoisie, the church's great influence, the revival of right-wing 
nationalism and obscurantism, deeper and deeper poverty and the specter of 
unemployment in a market economy -- will create a climate for the left's 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
This will be a new left, smaller but more authentic than the traditional model 
of the party that is leaving the scene and whose leading role remains only 
words in the constitution.

TRUCKEE: SOLITUDE IN THE SIERRA;

THIS RUSTIC MOUNTAIN TOWN HAS SURVIVED THE CRAZY DAYS OF SHOOT-OUTS, BORDELLOS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crowds will invade this old frontier town next weekend in a Labor Day salute 
marking the melancholy end of summertime in the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Picnics will be spread on the banks of Donner Lake and vacationers will float 
down the Truckee River in a parade of rafts, past rocky coves and deep green 
forests where the voice of a blue jay can be as startling as thunder. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 14 miles downriver from Lake Tahoe, the little town of Truckee appears 
like a turn-of-the-century post card. Saloons still do business on Donner Pass 
Road and trains roll into town regularly, dropping off passengers at Truckee's 
old-fashioned depot. 
</P>
<P>
At Bud's Sporting Goods Store &amp; Soda Fountain, waitresses serve ice cream 
cones while the proprietor sells night crawlers to fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in khaki overalls and sporting a crew cut, Truckee-born Bud Owen 
exchanges small talk with customers as they spoon sundaes and string lures. 
Bud's ice cream-and-tackle shop features Bud's Secret Lure (a hot fudge sundae 
topped with cookies and whipped cream), along with fishing poles, flies, nets 
and creels. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors away, James Hacker turns out copper sculptures and glass blower 
Frank Rossbach huffs and puffs for a lineup of customers. 
</P>
<P>
Vacationers crowd El Toro Bravo, ordering burritos and tacos, while across the 
street, leather goods are displayed in a marvelous old barn of a building that 
once served as an ice house. 
</P>
<P>
Although Truckee still resembles a scene out of "High Noon," one scribe 
insisted the little town is catching on as the "Carmel of the Sierras." Not 
quite. 
</P>
<P>
Truckee, which has survived fires and blizzards, is a rustic mountain town 
where shoot-outs once occurred with amazing regularity, saloons roared round 
the clock and bordellos flourished during periods when it served as a stage 
stop, a lumber center, a railroad town and the site of ice harvesting for the 
West before the era of refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay on his visit to Truckee, Allan R. Rahn wrote: "I used to think that 
towns like this were only recorded in tinted daguerreotypes hanging above 
near-sighted historians' desks, or in black and white documentaries about the 
oldest living local resident -- but in Truckee I got the feeling I was part of 
everything and that this town was part of me." 
</P>
<P>
Stepping through the door at Richardson House, a Victorian B&amp;B overlooking 
Truckee, is like lifting the curtain on a 19th-Century stage play. During 
winter a wood-burning stove warms the 100-year-old inn as skiers descend on 
Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
Deep sofas are scattered through the Victorian parlor, and guests snooze in 
rooms that feature high board beds, marble-top tables and clawfoot tubs. The 
former home of a lumberman, Richardson House is as snug as the scene from an 
old Currier &amp; Ives print. 
</P>
<P>
At Bridge Street and Donner Pass Road, the Truckee Hotel has sheltered guests 
since 1873. Lace curtains flutter at the windows and carved oak beds recall an 
era when the hotel welcomed railroaders, lumbermen and travelers passing 
through Truckee on the trail of the ill-fated Donner party. 
</P>
<P>
For solitude in the Sierra, though, not another lodge matches the magic of the 
Blue House Inn. Facing the Truckee River at the base of a towering mountain, 
the Blue House Inn rates five stars with its immense stone fireplace and a 
skylight for glimpsing the forest and meadows where deer graze and other 
wildlife appear at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves of books line one wall and guests soak in a hot tub and meet for 
cocktails at a gazebo beside the river. Pine and aspen rise from a sweep of 
lawn that unfolds to the banks of the Truckee, with its soothing song that 
mesmerizes the most hopeless of insomniacs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cape Cod-style home, with its shingled sides and gabled roof, features 
goose-down comforters, four-posters, queen beds and wood stoves that glow with 
the warmth of a chilly evening. 
</P>
<P>
For honeymooners and others seeking complete privacy, the Hideaway Suite offers 
solace in a setting of forest and flowers, with a hand-painted bed and stacks 
of firewood. In other guest quarters, French doors swing open to the patio and 
the tuneful Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
With winter, skiers from Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows and other playgrounds set 
up housekeeping in a room with queen-size sleigh beds, while icicles drip from 
eaves outside the window. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietress Ruth Hutchings, an Orange County widow who traded crowded 
suburbia for the peacefulness of Truckee, is renowned for her gourmet 
breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sierra, says she, she's found her peace. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Truckee village next weekend, vacationers will queue up outside The 
Cookery for "Harry's homemade chili," Smart's Wagon Train Coffee Shop 
(lumberjack breakfasts and fresh fruit pies), the Squeeze Inn for a peanut 
butter-jelly-banana-and-honey sandwich and O.B.'s Pub &amp; Restaurant, which 
serves up sea scallops in a strawberry sauce, steaks and a specialty known as 
Pasta O'Brien, which is to say fettuccini with tomatoes, garlic and herbs 
soaked in red wine. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar of America occupies the old Bank of America building on Commercial 
Street, where pictures of old-time gangsters line its walls: John Dillinger, 
Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Willie Sutton, Bonnie Parker, Ma Barker and 
the Al Capone mob. 
</P>
<P>
And there's The Tourist Club, through whose doors guests swing 16 hours a day, 
10 a.m. till 2 a.m. The Tourist Club caters to both locals and vacationers, its 
walls displaying caribou, deer, antelope and mountain goat trophies. While 
swilling Bloody Marys and mugs of ale, patrons feed coins into a jukebox that 
blares out melodies that include "The Gunfighter's Song" and "There's A Tear In 
My Beer." 
</P>
<P>
No one ever accused Truckee of being cosmopolitan. Friendly? Of course. 
Sophisticated? Ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
Summer's vacationers cast for trout at Donner Lake and along the banks of the 
Truckee, and when snows fall, skiers crowd the slopes at nine resorts near this 
little mountain town. 
</P>
<P>
In the '20s macho types played football with a cuspidor on Truckee's main drag, 
and Charlie Chaplin competed in dog-sled races while filming silent flicks. He 
was followed by Clark Gable and Loretta Young on location in Truckee for "Call 
of the Wild." Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy filmed the old classic, "Rose 
Marie," a few miles outside town. 
</P>
<P>
While saloons continue to do a lively business in Truckee, doors to bordellos 
lining Jibbom Street slammed their doors years ago. Gunfights are history, and 
so the wild and woolly West is as tame as a litter of kittens. 
</P>
<P>
Wine barrels filled with flowers line Commercial Street. A deli serves 
chocolate truffles as well as corned beef sandwiches, and a French restaurant 
is crowded with visitors up from Tahoe. With all the hullabaloo, some fear that 
success will spoil the frontier style of Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the bite of tragedy is recalled on Emigrant Trail, along with memories 
of the Donner Party and the fateful winter of 1846-47. It was near present-day 
Truckee that the Donner party was trapped by blizzards blowing off the Sierra. 
Although a handful succeeded in crossing the summit to safety, 37 starved to 
death or perished in fierce snowstorms. Of 89 original members, only 47 
survived the ordeal. A park near Truckee marks the scene of their encampment. 
</P>
<P>
Truckee was born as a stage stop in 1863. After that it grew into a bawdy boom 
town as the railroad arrived and lumber mills thrived. The Truckee Tribune told 
how hotel guests "went to sleep at night listening to the sound of silver at 
Truckee's faro tables and the mellifluous strains of music pouring from the 
saloons." 
</P>
<P>
Gunslingers dueled in the streets, poker parties operated 24 hours a day and 
dance halls seldom closed. Baby Face Nelson did time in the local slammer, and 
before that the constable used his basement as a lockup. 
</P>
<P>
By 1868 there were 14 lumber mills grinding away around the clock in Truckee. 
During the 1870s ice was harvested from lakes surrounding town to refrigerate 
rail cars carrying produce across the nation. After the lumber mills geared 
down and electric refrigeration put the ice harvesters out of business, Truckee 
took a downhill turn. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract tourists, the town created an ice palace that featured 
a skating rink with an orchestra and toboggan rides. Still, Truckee took a dive 
in the 1960s when motorists rolled along the new Interstate 80, bypassing the 
little mountain town. 
</P>
<P>
A few die-hards hung on, renovating 1800s and turn-of-the-century buildings. 
Soon they housed shops and restaurants, and the tourist boom began again. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Owen's tackle shop and ice cream parlor is a veritable gold mine, but the 
71-year-old proprietor sees no silver lining. During the down days he had less, 
but life was casual and Bud Owen was content. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel I'm getting crowded out," he said, scooping up a handful of 
night crawlers while a waitress scooped ice cream into a cone. "Once I knew 
everybody -- and then business picked up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Downriver at the River Ranch Restaurant &amp; Lodge, Labor Day weekenders will 
study rafters as they complete the four-mile journey from Tahoe City to this 
pleasant inn on the Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
They'll sip drinks on a sunny deck that faces the river, aware that soon the 
bright days of summer will pass and guests will retire inside to the warmth of 
a wood fire while snowflakes fall and winter returns with a muffled roar.

PETER'S PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What right has Peter Greenberg to use his column for a diatribe against the 
young, enthusiastic and attractive female cabin attendants that once made 
flying a pleasure and less of the traumatic melodrama it has become (for which 
aging stewardesses are partly to blame)? 
</P>
<P>
After thousands of words of rhetoric, Greenberg finally makes his point that in 
an emergency he'll feel safe in the hands of an old, experienced stewardess (or 
steward?). But that is stretching a point, besides being his only one. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, an emergency situation exists less than a 10th of 1% of the 
time. Secondly, a stew with just a year's service will have made over 150 
flights and logged as many as a half-million miles. This surely is plenty of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, would Greenberg deny a youngster her first job because 1) she's 
attractive and eager and 2) another woman twice her age has held the job for 20 
years, isn't going to be promoted and won't give up her job? Finally, hasn't 
frequent-flier Greenberg yet observed that as cabin attendants age, they become 
complacent, bored, jaded, bossy, disinterested and totally reliant upon job 
security and union rules that prevent them from having been replaced a decade 
or so earlier?

I have been with (United) for over 30 years, some years as a flight attendant, 
now in customer service on the ground. I want to thank Peter Greenberg for his 
column (Savvy Traveler, Aug. 13). His statement "in fact there is a whole new 
breed of unruly passengers" is so true, I see this every day at work at the 
(Los Angeles International) airport. Tell Peter Greenberg I'd like to buy him a 
drink on his next (United) flight. However, Allen Neuharth may find his dish on 
his lap!

I want to thank Peter S. Greenberg for his open letter to Allen H. Neuharth, 
who had not flown here commercially for 19 years. It was an excellent response 
to Neuharth's antiquated, sexist attitude! 
</P>
<P>
Flight attendants for too long were seen as glamorized waitresses when the 
emphasis needed to be put on their ability to handle safety and emergency 
situations. Thank goodness that attitude changed, even though the airline 
companies are still behind the times in offering salaries that would compensate 
for the harsher conditions these service-oriented workers face today. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, when Neuharth wants to see scantily dressed women who exhibit 
"peppy playfulness," he should visit entertainment emporiums where "pretty, 
young females" are paid to perform these duties!

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: HOW TO DECODE THE ABCS OF YOUR AIRLINE TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago it used to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
There were two classes of airline travel: first-class and economy. And two 
kinds of flights: nonstop and flights that made stops en route to your 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
There were just a few major jet aircraft types -- a Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8 
or, in Europe, perhaps a De Havilland Comet. 
</P>
<P>
Those simple days are long gone. Today there are dozens of fares, fare 
designations and restrictions for each individual airline seat. 
</P>
<P>
There are still nonstop flights, but now you can add direct flights, connecting 
flights, interline flights and equipment-change flights to the descriptions. 
Perhaps the most confusing terminology is in the area of flight class and fare 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional "F" (first-class) and "Y" (economy) tickets remain. But there 
are also "C" or "J" (business class) tickets and the even more confusing "P" 
class tickets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Myriad Economy Fares 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem comes in trying to decipher the myriad economy fares that 
may be listed on your ticket. The codes begin with letters like B, H, M, Q and 
V. Learning some of the special codes listed on the part of the ticket marked 
"fare basis/ticket designator" can help you understand what restrictions may be 
on your ticket, when you can fly and when you can't, without incurring 
significant penalties or extra costs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a "QXE7P25" code on your economy ticket can be one of the most 
restrictive. "Q" means that you're flying at less than the full published coach 
fare. "XE" indicates that the fare you paid is only good on weekdays. The "7" 
means you had to buy your ticket at least seven days in advance. And any time 
you see a "P," beware: It indicates a penalty if you cancel or otherwise change 
your itinerary or dates. 
</P>
<P>
In this case the "P25" means a 25% penalty. Any time you see an "X" followed by 
a number, that usually means you can't use the ticket on a specific day. A 
ticket with an "X6" would mean you can't fly on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The codes have another useful purpose. They denote whether the ticket is fully 
or partially refundable, or nonrefundable. And they give a pecking order, a 
caste system to determine which passengers would be accommodated first should a 
flight be delayed or canceled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A False Assumption 
</P>
<P>
Many travelers make the false assumption that just because a ticket reads 
"nonrefundable" it has no value if it is not used. Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Often an unused, nonrefundable ticket can be used as partial or full payment 
toward the purchase of another ticket. How do you know? Look in the upper left 
or lower right corner of your ticket, where there is space reserved for 
"endorsements." If the fare-basis codes haven't thoroughly restricted you 
enough, the endorsements will. 
</P>
<P>
Check the area on your ticket marked "method of payment." It's in the lower 
right corner. At the time of ticket purchase the airline will note whether you 
paid cash for your ticket or paid by check or credit card, whether the ticket 
was bought by exchanging another ticket or whether the ticket was prepaid by 
someone else (and again, the method of payment). 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you bought your ticket with your credit card and later want to 
refund it, don't expect the airline to give you cash. The refund is made 
directly to your credit-card account. 
</P>
<P>
(Note: This process can take many weeks for the paper work to wend its way 
through the airline's accounting system. To avoid hassles with your credit-card 
company, photocopy the credit receipt the airline agent gives you at the time 
you ask for a refund, and enclose the copy with your next credit-card bill if 
the credit doesn't appear on your statement.) 
</P>
<P>
The same applies if someone else paid for your ticket. It's not like returning 
a gift to a department store for a credit in your name. Under airline 
accounting procedures, the credit will be issued to the account originally used 
to buy the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchange Over Refund 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if you don't want to use a ticket that was bought for you but also 
don't want to lose the credit, don't ask for a refund. Instead, exchange the 
ticket for another ticket of equal value. If the new ticket is more expensive, 
you will only have to pay the difference. 
</P>
<P>
One important caution: Each airline ticket has its own ticking clock; it is 
valid for only one year from the original date of issue. So if you're sitting 
on any unused tickets while reading this, check the date of issue. Once the 
year has expired, the airline will not reissue a new ticket against it. 
</P>
<P>
Some tickets might also read "non-endorsable." What this means is that the 
ticket can't be used on any other airline. And the most restricted endorsements 
are on some discount tickets where the fare paid is so low (usually sold by 
consolidators in the United States or by under-the-counter "bucket shops" 
overseas) that the ticket reads "nonendorseable, nonrefundable, nonnegotiable." 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, if you don't use this ticket on the date and for the 
flight listed on the ticket, you have no option but to frame the ticket as a 
small memento of your decision to change your schedule. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the front of the ticket. When was the last time you read the 
contract that appears on the back of every airline ticket, or is inserted in 
the ticket jacket that surrounds it? 
</P>
<P>
The airlines' "notice of conditions of contract" aren't written with your best 
interests at heart. Not surprisingly, the airlines do everything they can to 
limit their liability when it comes to flight schedules, times of arrival, 
baggage and even the destination of your plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Right to Overbook 
</P>
<P>
The notice even gives airlines the right to overbook and bump passengers. On 
domestic flights, where some state or federal laws can prevail, you are 
slightly more protected. But on international flights, passengers are often 
victimized by something called the Warsaw Convention that regulates airline 
travel around the world. 
</P>
<P>
On foreign flights it limits the airline's liability, in the event of a 
passenger's injury or death, to $75,000. (There's no limit on domestic 
flights.) It also limits an airline's liability if it loses your baggage on an 
international flight. 
</P>
<P>
But be careful -- your flight between San Diego and Los Angeles may seem 
domestic, but if the plane continues to London, it is considered international. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, there are some airline rules you won't find in the notice but need 
to know. Some airlines also have a policy that lost luggage be reported within 
four hours of arrival. 
</P>
<P>
But if your bags miss your flight and an airline representative tells you it 
should be on their next flight, be sure to check on when it's due to arrive. If 
it is scheduled to arrive more than four hours later, insist on filing a report 
immediately.

THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH; 
</P>
<P>
ZEN MASTER GUIDES STUDENTS ON ELUSIVE PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alot of searching goes on out there, Grasshopper. But truth can sneak up on you 
when you least expect it. 
</P>
<P>
Joshu Sasaki, the Mt. Baldy Zen Center's 82-year-old Roshi, or Zen Master, 
rarely talks to outsiders nowadays. Mostly, the venerable spiritual leader 
spends his days in his little wood-slat cabin in the mountain, meditating and 
teaching his students and acolytes according to the oblique methods of Zen 
Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no predicting the Roshi. His students, in the monastery-like 
compound over which Sasaki presides, a former Boy Scout camp on the shoulder of 
the San Gabriel Mountains' highest peak, are often baffled by the master. 
</P>
<P>
"He's difficult to understand sometimes," said one elderly monk during a rare 
idle moment at the Zen center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Roshi has agreed to meet an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
This makes administrative director Koyo, who reluctantly leads the visitor 
along a path past towering Douglas firs to the Roshi's cabin, a little 
apprehensive. "I don't know how much you've prepared for this," says Koyo, 42, 
formerly Charles Engennach of Trenton, N.J., "but he probably won't answer a 
lot of academic questions on the nature of Buddhism." 
</P>
<P>
Then Koyo shrugs. "But I don't want to predict what the Roshi will or will not 
say," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Academically speaking, Zen is a school of Buddhism dating back to the 12th 
Century, when Japanese masters adapted Indian and Chinese meditation techniques 
and moral discipline in the search for transcendental illumination. From the 
Zen perspective, true wisdom is rarely straightforward or capable of being 
expressed objectively. 
</P>
<P>
The serious student seeks to escape "the eternal donkey hitching post" of 
objective language, as one Zen saying puts it, to a transcendental truth which 
can only be expressed in poetry or paradoxical riddles called koans. (Probably 
the most often-repeated koan in the Western world: "What is the sound of one 
hand clapping?") 
</P>
<P>
Sasaki came from Japan to Mt. Baldy 27 years ago, at the beginning of a wave of 
American interest in Zen Buddhism. College students were studying Alan Watts' 
books on Zen, the "beat" writers were waxing freely about Dharma (the sum of 
Buddhist truth), zazen (the Zen form of meditation) and other exotic ideas, and 
the first Japanese teachers were arriving in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, it was come one, come all, and all of us hippies came 
bouncing through the door," said Koyo, a tall, angular man, with his head 
shaved and his body wrapped in a black robe. "There was revolution in the air, 
you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Not the sort of bedrock on which to build a movement. By the mid-1970s, despite 
the popularity of a television "Kung Fu" character, who spouted ageless 
Zen-like profundities in the American West, Zen was fading into a broad 
American panorama of cults, churches and pop philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Those early students, intrigued by Zen thought's challenge to rational thought, 
weren't known for their longevity in the discipline, said Koyo, who has been 
studying Zen since 1971. "Most people get involved for a couple of years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Zen tide of the 1960s left behind some lasting institutions dedicated 
to the promotion of Zen thought. One of these was Rinzai-Ji, a Los 
Angeles-based national organization, the parent body of the Mt. Baldy center. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain center's faded red, wooden buildings seem to have been sprinkled 
randomly in a hollow 6,000 feet up the mountain, high above the smog line. 
There's a large meditation hall, an eating hall, an office, several dormitories 
and, on a knoll overlooking the camp, the Roshi's cabin. 
</P>
<P>
With its tree-lined vistas and blue skies, the place produces a feeling of 
almost palpable tranquility, outsiders often note. "Walk through the compound 
and you wonder sometimes if anyone's there," said George Duffy, a Forest 
Service Officer from the Mt. Baldy district, who frequently patrols the road 
past the Zen center. "They do maintain a real peaceful setting there, with a 
sense of some kind of higher association with the world, like going to a 
convent or a religious shrine." 
</P>
<P>
But there is hard work going on there too, under a system of rigorous 
discipline. The Roshi's students -- there are 23 of them, including monks 
engaged in long-term studies and uninitiated novices who are here for the 
summer -- get up every morning at 3. Their day is filled with tasks (such as 
building a retaining wall, putting a new roof on the shower house or cooking), 
meditation, one-on-one brainstorming with their master and silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Banter, chatting, wondering what's going to happen tomorrow -- that's all 
considered a distraction from the reality that's being expressed," said Koyo. 
Bedtime is at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otherworldly Realms 
</P>
<P>
Koyo shows you the main meditation hall, a long unadorned room, with benches 
along the walls and cushions on which students perch in the cross-legged lotus 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In meditation it is easy to "drift into otherworldly kinds of realms," said 
Koyo. The meditation leader, a senior member of the group, sometimes polices 
the hall with a long, flat stick with which he brings dreamers and fidgeters 
back to the task at hand. Transgressions are met with stinging whacks with the 
stick, or keisaka, on the muscle of each shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Meditation, a way of heightening awareness, is central to Zen. "It's not 
thought," Koyo said. "In some ways, thought interferes with meditation. You 
need to direct it into its deeper expressions." Ideally, he adds, the awareness 
that comes from meditation carries over to other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, the center holds week-long sesshins, or retreats, when students 
spend hours at a time in meditation. The mid-year sesshin has recently ended. 
"Don't you notice my glow?" said Koyo. 
</P>
<P>
A monk knocks two wooden blocks together, summoning the students for a short 
pre-luncheon meditation. They meditate for 10 minutes, then walk single file, 
wordlessly, to the dining hall, where they eat a meal of mashed potatoes (with 
margarine) and lettuce-and-radish salad. 
</P>
<P>
After the meal, several have time to speak to the visitor. One introduces 
himself as Dogo, a former teamster and welterweight boxer from New York. What 
brought him to the Zen Center? "It's a big, long, sloppy story," said Dogo, 63, 
who was known in his earlier life as Pat Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
"After I quit boxing (in 1948), everything sort of went sour," said Dogo, a 
bespectacled man who squints in the sun like someone who has just awakened from 
a refreshing sleep. "I started using drugs, my wife got in trouble over me and 
she left me alone with the baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruitless Psychoanalysis 
</P>
<P>
After three years of fruitless psychoanalysis, Dogo read a book by the Zen 
interpreter Shunryu Suzuki and looked up "Zen" in the Manhattan telephone book. 
He wound up at the Zen Institute in New York in 1967. He has been at the Mt. 
Baldy center for three years, where Roshi Sasaki has brought him contentment, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a chance to earn $1 million in gold coins everyday," Dogo said with 
twinkling eyes. "But I'm talking too much about myself. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What koan is he meditating on now? Dogo hold his eyes shut tight, as if to make 
sure he gets it right. "How do I realize my family 2,700 miles away?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's meeting room is a small sitting area with a table and four 
mismatched chairs. Zen writers have referred to meetings with Zen masters as 
entering the lion's den, because of the vigorous exchanges they inspire with 
their students. But Roshi Sasaki, a small, sunny man who smiles hospitably, is 
far from leonine. 
</P>
<P>
He jokes good-naturedly about his age. "Eating is difficult," he says, speaking 
a thickly accented English. "Sometimes the fork falls down." He says he sleeps 
from three to seven hours a day. "But meditation is a good resting position," 
he said. His students, most of them white Americans, are very serious about 
their studies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Where does one begin to learn Zen? "Breathing," he said enigmatically. Pressed 
to talk about deeper issues, Sasaki speaks at length about the paradox of the 
duality of life. (A traditional saying puts it like this: "One moon shows in 
every pool; in every pool the one moon.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'True Love' 
</P>
<P>
"Real God is God nobody knows," said Sasaki. "Father not real father, mother 
not real mother. Real parent is one." He hold his two hands up, then clasps 
them in front of his face. "Father, mother completely become one. It is true 
love. Everything is my brother." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, he said, is "beyond subject and object, beyond knowing and 
expression." How does man transcend reality? "Practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Roshi's accent is impenetrable, with extra syllables rolling out, 
like stones falling from an overloaded truck. His voice rises and fades. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no objective human," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, an amused Koyo said the Roshi often intentionally mumbles and 
mispronounces. "There's a lot going on that he's interested in besides just the 
words," said Koyo. "The most poignant moments in our lives are often silent." 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's way of talking -- is it a strategy to inspire the student to think 
harder? 
</P>
<P>
Koyo smiles craftily. "What do you think?" he said.

IRWINDALE'S SMALL BUT BIG ON ISSUING GUN PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Newhall attorney Gary Symonds applied for a permit to carry a concealed 
weapon, he didn't rely on the local police but instead made the 45-mile drive 
from his home to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale Police Chief Julian Miranda had never met Symonds, but he granted the 
permit after a background search and interview, explaining: "I guess it was one 
of those days I was understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Retired businessman Anthony Rich Jagunich also made the trip to Irwindale when 
he wanted a concealed weapons permit. Even though Jagunich lives in Alhambra, 
he was granted a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even go shopping without it," Jagunich said, reciting a litany of 
urban horror stories: rape, robbery and assault, none of which has ever 
happened to him. "With this on my hip, at least I stand a chance." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to carry a weapon in their coat or car, Irwindale may be the 
place to go. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda granted 30 permits last year -- the third-highest number approved by 
any law-enforcement agency in Los Angeles County -- although Irwindale is one 
the smallest cities in the county with just 1,200 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The list of legally armed citizens includes Vice Mayor Pat Miranda (the police 
chief's older brother), Assistant City Manager Alfred F. Herrera, Chamber of 
Commerce Director Joseph Discianni and public relations consultant Xavier 
Hermosillo, architect of the city's efforts to woo the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the group of city officials, a number of out-of-towners have 
been granted permits, including a Los Angeles liquor store owner, a Glendora 
diamond merchant and a husband-wife team of gun dealers from West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
What they have all found in Irwindale is one of the county's most liberal 
interpretations of California's concealed weapons law. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows sheriffs and police chiefs to grant permits, valid throughout 
the state, as long as they believe the applicant is of "good moral character" 
and has a "good cause." 
</P>
<P>
The vagueness of those two terms has resulted in a baffling array of 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
In some jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, concealed weapons permits are 
virtually impossible to get. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Police Department has issued no permits in at least the last three 
years, despite applications from a member of the Board of Directors, a 
paraplegic and a domestic-law attorney whose life had been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has qualified," said Lt. Wes Rice, who is in charge of screening 
applicants. "I mean, a lot of people will say, 'Hey, I carry around a lot of 
cash so can I carry a gun.' Well, as far as we're concerned, hire a guard." 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale lies at the other end of the regulatory spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"You can talk to the chief of police in a small city," Symonds said in support 
of Irwindale and with a trace of disdain for departments that make it hard for 
citizens to legally carry a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Miranda has granted permits to a secretary, a truck driver, a corporate 
security officer and a general contractor -- none of whom, he agrees, are in 
any more danger than, say, the town custodian, who also has a concealed weapons 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I know the guy and he is going to use good judgment," Miranda said. 
"If the public doesn't want us to give permits, let them change the law." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda's attitude toward concealed weapons permits, although liberal compared 
to other cities in Los Angeles County, is actually on the conservative side in 
the overall scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
In some jurisdictions, concealed weapons permits are handed out not by the 
dozens, but by the hundreds or even thousands. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,860 permits were issued in Kern County last year, easily eclipsing 
the 362 granted in all of Los Angeles County, which has 17 times the 
population. Bakersfield alone issued 424 permits last year. 
</P>
<P>
In tiny Sierra County, with just 3,400 residents, 94 permits were issued last 
year, meaning that one out of every 35 residents could legally carry a 
concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, Irwindale's permit count is topped only by Culver City 
with 98 and Montebello with 36. 
</P>
<P>
Concealed weapons permits allow people to carry loaded handguns on their 
persons or in their cars. Keeping a weapon at home or in a place of business 
requires no special permit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most common recipients are judges and reserve police officers; in 
some cities, such as Alhambra and San Gabriel, they are the only ones who 
currently hold permits. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 permits approved by Miranda, one is held by a former municipal judge 
and four by active reserve officers. 
</P>
<P>
The rest are in the hands of a broad cross section of the community whose need 
for carrying a weapon is sometimes more perceptual than real, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Irwindale city custodian Floyd R. Reyes, who has had a 
permit for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said Reyes applied for a concealed weapons permit because he works 
alone early in the morning hours cleaning the buildings of the City Hall 
complex. As far as he knows, Reyes has never been in any danger while working, 
Miranda said. The Police Department is located next to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Perez, an Azusa dealer of weapons and police equipment, was granted a 
permit because he is well-known by the officers in Irwindale and considered a 
level-headed friend by the chief. "We buy a lot from him," said Miranda, adding 
he knew of no unusual threats against Perez. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 of the 30 permits were approved by Miranda's predecessor and have 
been renewed each year as a favor to the former chief, who left 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said even he is puzzled why some of those people have permits. Los 
Angeles liquor store owner Phillip Goldhammer was granted a permit 14 years ago 
and has had no problems renewing it every year. "Frankly, I don't know how he 
got one," Miranda said. "He's got a liquor store in a rough area, though." 
</P>
<P>
Goldhammer, as did several others interviewed for this story, refused to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
One of Miranda's top criteria in reviewing a permit is how well he knows the 
applicant. The vast majority of permit holders are longtime friends who 
probably would be rejected if they applied in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said he knows of only one case in which a permit holder abused his 
privilege by brandishing a gun during a barroom altercation. The man's permit 
was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria for getting a concealed weapons permit, especially in smaller 
cities, are often not much more substantial than Irwindale's. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia Police Chief William Tubbs has a printed list of criteria, including 
the requirement that applicants provide a statement describing what "clear and 
present danger" they face. 
</P>
<P>
But Tubbs said he mainly relies on his personal knowledge of applicants. He 
granted one permit to an out-of-town roofing contractor who had contributed 
money to the Police Department and helped the local YMCA, of which Tubbs is a 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
"The people gave me the power to grant a permit and I am going to be as 
judicious as I can," he said. "If I'm going to do it for anyone, why not him?" 
</P>
<P>
In El Monte, Police Chief Wayne C. Clayton gave a permit to a locksmith who 
felt he needed to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a judgment call," he said. "The desire and need for a permit has to be 
evaluated and a determination made. Somebody has to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Not all police chiefs are comfortable with residents carrying concealed 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne Police Chief W. J. Stearns said: "There are so many guns on the street 
I feel bad about adding to it. I'd prefer it if there were no permits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tacit Approval' of Use 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs said the thought of an amateur wielding a gun bothers him on occasion, 
even when he knows the permit holder well. 
</P>
<P>
"You give a permit and it's kind of a tacit approval for them to use the gun," 
he said. "That's a dangerous set of circumstances to be confronted with." 
</P>
<P>
But Tubbs and other police chiefs said the concerns about concealed weapons 
permits are minor compared to dealing with the tens of thousands of illegal 
concealed weapons in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda talks about his evidence room, which is filled with confiscated 
sawed-off shotguns, hunting rifles and semiautomatic pistols. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the weapons we have to worry about," Miranda said. "Come here on a 
Friday night. It sounds like World War II."

RULING UPHELD ON POMONA ELECTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
APPEALS COURT BACKS DECISION THAT SYSTEM DOESN'T DILUTE MINORITY VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court has upheld a district judge's ruling that Pomona's 
at-large election system doesn't discriminate against blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman's decision that the 
plaintiffs in the case failed to meet standards established in a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision as necessary to prove an at-large system dilutes the minority 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in 1985 by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund and San Antonio-based Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, 
alleged at-large elections for the city's five council seats prevented minority 
candidates from winning. A federal court judge ruled for the city in 1986, and 
the civil rights groups appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Ursua, who was elected to the council in March but lost a council 
election in 1985, was one of three unsuccessful candidates who sued. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the case said they were "shocked" and "surprised" by the ruling 
Thursday. They said they won't know what further action they will take until 
they see the court's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hernandez, president of the San Antonio group, said the ruling by the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is "ironic in light of the Watsonville case" 
and ignores "the fact that there is a history of discrimination and a polarized 
vote. Minorities have a difficult time at the local level." The Latino 
community in the city of Watsonville, Calif., recently won a case in which they 
alleged at-large elections shut them out of city government. 
</P>
<P>
But the court held that the Pomona plaintiffs had not demonstrated that 
minorities were politically cohesive and sufficiently concentrated so that 
minority districts could be drawn or that an Anglo voting bloc had consistently 
defeated minority candidates, criteria established by the 1986 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision in Thornburg vs. Gingles. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities constitute about half of Pomona's 120,000 population. In the city's 
101-year history, no blacks and only four Latinos have been elected to the City 
Council. Two of the Latinos, Ursua and Nell Soto, are on the council now. 
Neither was available for comment immediately after the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the two have said a large turnout by the city's black and Latino 
voters made their victories possible. But, said MALDEF attorney Richard Larson, 
the "occasional election of minorities in at-large elections does not detract 
from the fact that at-large violates a fair voting system." 
</P>
<P>
He added that if the city switched to district elections, there would be enough 
Latinos to fill two districts. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Deputy District Atty. Bill Curley lauded the court's decision, saying it 
proves that "at this point we can assume we've got a non-discriminatory 
system." But he conceded that with Pomona's large minority population, 
districts "certainly could be crafted to ensure minority representation," and 
that the City Council had discussed changing the elections process.

45 POSTAL JOBS SHIFTED OUT OF PASADENA

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service has cut 45 jobs in the Pasadena division as part of a 
nationwide effort to control costs and increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs in finance, human resources, marketing and operations support -- some 
of which are already vacant -- will shift to departments of the Van Nuys 
Division, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena changes, which are anticipated to save $1.5 million annually, will 
take effect Sept. 23, the beginning of the Postal Service's new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pasadena mail processing center is not closing down, and no postal 
employees are losing employment," said Jose L. Castellano, acting Pasadena 
Management Sectional Center manager/postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service stopped filling administrative vacancies three months ago, 
including those at regional and headquarters levels, in anticipation of the 
consolidation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All employees affected by the realignment will retain current grades and 
salaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for our customers to realize that the changes will have no 
adverse impact on their mail service," Castellano said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has been a Management Sectional Center of the Van Nuys Division since 
a Postal Service realignment in early 1986.

DEPARTING RIO HONDO PRESIDENT LOSES BATTLE OVER SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first it seemed like a simple request, one of the last official acts of a 
departing president. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Sussman, the leader of Rio Hondo Community College for seven years, 
wanted to create a scholarship in his name. 
</P>
<P>
But like many other efforts in the waning years of Sussman's controversial 
tenure -- the request caused turmoil. Sussman, whose contract was not renewed 
last fall, asked that the recipient of a scholarship bearing his name be 
announced at the annual commencement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members and college staff described Sussman's effort as one last act 
of defiance, an attempt to force his foes on the board to listen to his name 
being read when the scholarship is presented every year. Sussman denies the 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the board voted 4 to 1 to reject Sussman's scholarship 
proposal, which was being funded by donations largely from Rio Hondo faculty 
and staff. Trustee Isabelle Gonthier cast the only vote in favor of Sussman's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only One Is Presented 
</P>
<P>
About 40 scholarships are awarded every year at Rio Hondo Community College and 
only one, the valedictorian award, is presented at the ceremony. Sussman's 
scholarship, which would have been given to a graduating biology student, was 
not on a par with the valedictorian scholarship, according to the board members 
who voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern that a graduation ceremony would be lengthened 
considerably if all scholarship sponsors made the same request. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman questioned the board's priorities. "Let's talk about scholarships for 
students," Sussman said Wednesday night after the board meeting. "Let's not 
talk about shortcutting a commencement for 15 minutes. Let's talk about 
students." 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, college staff members tried to persuade Sussman, who will 
teach anatomy at the college in the fall, to compromise. Pamela Cox, the 
college's public information officer, said she offered to place a special 
insert in the graduation program to recognize Sussman's scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Announcement 
</P>
<P>
Sussman refused. "It's the announcement to the audience that's the critical 
thing," he said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is appropriate for (the name of) every student that graduates from 
this college and gets a scholarship . . . to be announced at commencement so 
that their parents and friends can hear," Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman said he had wanted Rio Hondo officials to place the donations, which so 
far have totaled $1,300, in an interest-earning account. At the end of each 
year, the interest would have been given to a student transferring to a 
four-year college or university, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman said he will give the money to another community college. "It will make 
students at another community college very happy," he said. Those who donated 
to the fund and disagree with his plans can have their money back, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motives Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Board member Ralph Pacheco accused Sussman of being selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"If he thought that strongly about announcing all scholarships during 
commencement, why didn't he implement that during his tenure as president?" 
Pacheco asked. "You have to question the motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are doing it out of generosity, you give without expecting 
recognition," he said. "The person with the humble and contrite heart would not 
be concerned if his name is mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco and board members Hilda Solis, Bill Hernandez and Marilee Morgan voted 
against Sussman's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism from 3 Trustees 
</P>
<P>
It has not been unusual for the three Latino trustees to spar with Sussman. The 
three have accused the departing president of not doing enough to hire minority 
staff members and of failing to recruit promising students in the heavily 
Latino communities that surround the campus just north of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the three trustees didn't like Sussman's personality, they said. 
Pacheco once called Sussman "brash, capricious and arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said: "The situation had broken down to the point where they could no 
longer work with him. It made for a very tense seven months." 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, the three Latino trustees approved an offer to buy out 
Sussman's contract, but the president asked for more money than the board 
members were willing to pay. Instead, Solis, Pacheco and Hernandez voted not to 
renew Sussman's contract for the 1989-90 school year, even though he had 
announced that he was retiring in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the contract dispute, Morgan and Gonthier supported the president 
and defended his leadership style. Morgan also organized a going-away party for 
Sussman and solicited funds for a scholarship in his name at the college. She 
said she did not invite the three Latino trustees at Sussman's request. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Morgan's decision to vote against Sussman's scholarship proposal 
Wednesday night caught some board members by surprise. After the meeting Morgan 
sat quietly, dabbing tears. She said she was sorry that the board could not 
reach a compromise with Sussman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad, very disappointed," Morgan said. "I did not think it (the 
scholarship proposal) was a legitimate request." She said there was "no way to 
accommodate his wish" because all scholarship sponsors would have wanted their 
awards announced as well. 
</P>
<P>
But, Gonthier, who voted in favor of Sussman's proposal, said she was willing 
to make the sacrifice, if it meant money for students. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the students to lose, no matter what the conditions are," 
Gonthier said. "I want us to find another way to work it out."

STAGE WEEK: 'OVER JORDAN': A STORY OF SALVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a California suburb get ready to welcome a predicted spacecraft 
landing in Mark McNease's "Over Jordan," a new play that just opened at Friends 
and Artists Theatre in the Hollywood district. "It's our first original 
production -- after 2 1/2 years of working out different styles and pulling a 
company together," said Friends and Artists artistic director Sal Romeo. The 
piece, written for the 40-member group by company member McNease, features 12 
actors: nine from the company and three from outside. "We always try to cast at 
least one-quarter from the outside, to keep us from getting stale and 
incestuous," Romeo explained. 
</P>
<P>
He describes the play as "a story of salvation: what it means to the characters 
in the play -- and, by extension, to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"It centers on a man who's dying and realizes in the eleventh hour that he's 
been escaping life. He reads in an Enquirer-type magazine about this woman in 
Jordan who's going to be channeling aliens from outer space and decides to go 
there. It's really a look at our modern culture, and who our saviors are now: 
Jesus? Stock portfolios? It asks, 'Can we ever be saved from the outside?' The 
answer is no. Redemption must come from within. It's got to come from you." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Delegall directs. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER FILE: Black fraternity life is the subject of Gerard Brown's "Jonin,' " 
opening Friday at the Harman Ave. Theatre. Stanley Bennett Clay directs 
Kristoff St. John, Craig Thomas, Dawn Comer, Donald Willis, Eugene Williams, 
Greg Travis, Ron Lawrence, Dwight Donaldson and Rugg Williams. . . . Rita 
Valencia's "Confessions in Total Darkness" -- described as "part reading, part 
happening, part environmental theater" -- opens Sept. 9 at downtown's Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. Tony Abatemarco directs. 
</P>
<P>
Casting has been set for Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Our Country's Good," opening 
Sept. 14 at the Mark Taper Forum. The players include Tony Amendola, Caitlin 
Clarke, Deborah Fallender, Gail Grate, Harris Laskawy, Valerie Mahaffey, John 
Cameron Mitchell, Michael Morgan, Mark Moses and James Walch. . . . Also Sept. 
14, Weba and the Wailing Turbans open at Cafe Largo in the new musical "Come to 
My Heaven," written by Weba Garretson and Steve Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of Ayn Rand's "Ideal" (set during the author's '30s 
experiences as a costumer in Hollywood) will be Oct. 13 at the Melrose Theatre; 
producing is Keller Enterprises. . . . Also premiering Oct. 13 is 
"Frankenstein" -- opening at Long Beach's International City Theatre -- adapted 
from the Mary Shelley novel by Elaine Gerdine, conceived and directed by John 
Julian, with a contemporary score by Denise Wilson and Susan Wickam. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Larry Shue's Czechoslovakia-set "Wenceslas Square" is 
playing at the Matrix Theatre. Lee Shallat directs Adam Arkin, Nancy Lenahan, 
Richard Murphy and James Sloyan. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Dan Sullivan: "What does it feel like to live in such a 
country? The thing that makes 'Wenceslas' so effective -- besides Shallat's 
superb cast -- is that it doesn't pretend to have any insider knowledge. It is 
content to convey the things a visitor might notice over a week's stay." 
</P>
<P>
In the Herald Examiner, Charles Marowitz faulted Shue for venturing into 
serious territory: " 'Wenceslas Square' feels a little like one of those Woody 
Allen pictures where you wish the artist would drop his pose of studied 
solemnity and begin to do what he does best." 
</P>
<P>
Noted Lawrence Enscoe in the Daily News: "This play, about the quenching of the 
artistic spirit . . . is as contemporary as the tanks rumbling through Tian An 
Men Square. There is also a veiled but powerful condemnation of theater in 
America -- a somnambulistic creature that seems to awaken only when there's 
money to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joel Martin Levy in the Reader: "Not a great deal actually happens in 
'Wenceslas,' nor is much new revealed about Eastern-Bloc repression. But we do 
develop an affection for these characters living in a society very different 
from our own, and we experience their profound frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
And from Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "The stories of jailed dissidents 
that pepper the news today are inherently heart-wrenching, yet Shue's attempt 
to capture it from an insider's view only amounts to one overwhelming emotion 
-- futility. Perhaps that is how it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Footnote: In the Aug. 13 Critical Crossfire, a quote from a review of "Boys' 
Life" was inadvertently misattributed to Drama Logue's Tom McCulloh. The author 
of the review was Susan Armine who writes for the Reader.

ON THE RECORD: RESURRECTING MOZART'S MUSICAL SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the emphasis nowadays on period-performance Mozart or sleek, 
small-orchestra Mozart on modern instruments, the sensibilities are easily 
rattled by an encounter with the composer the way he used to sound. 
</P>
<P>
An extreme example of Mozart past is found in a CD reissue of the "Jupiter" 
Symphony recorded by Sir Thomas Beecham and his Royal Philharmonic shortly 
before the venerated conductor's death in 1960 (EMI/Angel Studio 69811). 
</P>
<P>
What once (we are told, and may even dimly recall) sounded bright, energetic 
and stylish is bloated, coarse and ponderous today -- all the more so for 
Beecham's insistence on improving Mozart's finale by inserting an alien 
trombone part, an expanded timpani part and, ultimately, the most egregious 
ritardando not of the composer's invention in the history of recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
The companion piece, Beethoven's Second Symphony, responds well to the burly 
energy of Beecham &amp; Co. and is presented in a form the composer might 
readily have recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Beecham is stingy with "Jupiter" repeats, Riccardo Muti, who leads the 
Berlin Philharmonic (on EMI/Angel 47465), is generous indeed. Which is the 
extent of his involvement with Classical style in this thickly textured, 
spasmodic reading. 
</P>
<P>
As fillup, Muti and the far too numerous BPO strings inflate the little 
Divertimento in D, K. 136, with heavy attacks and gratuitous repeats. 
</P>
<P>
The Symphony No. 29 in A, K. 201, with its airborne melodies and delicate 
scoring, is an impressive vehicle for the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra under its 
music director, the ubiquitous Iona Brown (Omega 1004). 
</P>
<P>
Listeners familiar with Brown's work will find here the same expert string 
balances and buoyancy that mark the playing of the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra. Brown's program is, however, unlikely to win awards for originality. 
The prospect of yet another string divertimento (both K. 136 and K. 138 are 
included) and "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" does not make the pulse race. 
</P>
<P>
Period specialist John Eliot Gardiner and his English Baroque Soloists 
orchestra have lately added to their substantial discography trim, peppery 
traversals of the "Paris" Symphony, K. 297, with its two different minuets, and 
the glorious C-major Symphony, K. 334, with the minuet (K. 409) presumed to 
have been intended for what Mozart ultimately left a three-movement work 
(Philips 420 937). 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner and his orchestra also continue their now nearly complete recorded 
series of the Mozart piano concertos with the ever insightful, erudite and, 
most important, lively Malcolm Bilson at the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
The latest installment (Deutsche Grammophon Archiv 423 595) offers the intimate 
Concerto in A, K. 488, and the grand, endlessly surprising Concerto in E-flat, 
K. 482. In the latter, in spite of a performance that could hardly be bettered, 
one begins to sense that the light-toned 18th-Century piano is losing its 
struggle for primacy in the face of the composer's ever-increasing demands for 
orchestral sonority. 
</P>
<P>
The modern piano has no problems, of course, competing for sonic dominance with 
a modern orchestra -- again, Brown and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, 
performing with silken polish. But Swiss pianist Brigitte Meyer proves a 
dulcet-toned, miniaturizing cipher in K. 488 and in the deep, dark Concerto in 
E-flat, K. 271 (Omega 1003). 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of personality in Mozart's four Horn Concertos, with 
additional fragments, as presented by Lowell Greer, principal hornist of the 
Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, which joins him here under the jovially 
energetic direction of Nicholas McGegan (Harmonia Mundi 907012). 
</P>
<P>
Greer obtains a variety of tone and color from his valveless blunderbuss that 
might be the envy of many performers on the modern French horn. One feels not 
so much the arduousness of his task as his pleasure in conquering its 
exigencies.

JAZZ: NORMAN GRANZ AND THE PABLO JAZZ JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How and when can a single three-day festival yield 15 compact discs and 12 
hours of superior music? When the talent is supplied and the records are 
produced by Norman Granz. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Granz family of Pablo Records jazz giants was on hand during a 
weekend in Montreux, Switzerland, in July of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The CD versions include several additional tracks that were not on the original 
LPs. 
</P>
<P>
The joyous informality of the occasion led to many overlaps of personnel. Oscar 
Peterson is heard as leader or sideman on six records, Ray Brown on five, Niels 
Pedersen and Lockjaw Davis and Clark Terry on four, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was something in the mountain air, or just the mutual good vibes 
among mature and dedicated musicians; whatever the cause, the results varied 
from acceptable to exceptional -- more often the latter, as the ratings will 
reveal. 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR PETERSON AND THE BASSISTS Pablo Live OJCCD 383-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR PETERSON JAM OJCCD 378-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
PABLO ALL STARS JAM with OSCAR PETERSON, MILT JACKSON, CLARK TERRY et al OJCCD 
380-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
MILT JACKSON/RAY BROWN with CLARK TERRY et al JCCD 375-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's collaboration with the world's greatest bass players, Brown and 
Denmark's Pedersen, was a summit meeting without precedent. Except for brief 
passages on a blues, the bassists do not play together, but a play-by-play 
rundown makes identification easy. Peterson was doubly inspired; Brown and 
Pedersen, each in his own way, are formidable both as soloists and rhythm 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The Peterson Jam, with Gillespie and Terry on trumpet and Davis on tenor, rises 
above its program (the tunes are predictable) to provide inspired moments. 
Terry has the first solo on "Just in Time" and Gillespie on "Bye Bye Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The Pablo Jam is notable for the inclusion of a rarely heard soloist, tenor 
saxophonist Ronnie Scott (better known as owner of London's famous jazz club), 
who suggests early John Coltrane. Milt Jackson and Joe Pass are airborne 
throughout "Samba de Orfeu," as is Peterson in "Pennies From Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Monty Alexander replaces Peterson on the Jackson/Brown jam, notable for a 
stealthy minor Brown blues called "Slippery." Inconsequentially diverting is a 
blues vocal by Jackson and Terry. 
</P>
<P>
ELLA FITZGERALD with TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO OJCCD 376-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO OJCCD 372-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Ella cuts a swath from "My Man" (introduced by Mistinguett in 1920) to Paul 
Williams and Stevie Wonder. Her indigo finals to "I Ain't Got Nothing but the 
Blues" is reward enough in itself. Flanagan, the ideal accompanist, is also the 
soigne soloist, dealing elegantly with Gillespie, Parker, Ellington and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
COUNT BASIE BIG BAND OJCCD 377-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
MONTREUX JAM SESSIONS with BASIE, PETERSON, GILLESPIE, JACKSON, et al *** 
</P>
<P>
Just how much Basie's piano meant to his band is vividly displayed, along with 
a personnel only four of whose members are still in the orchestra (the maestro 
and five others have died). Originals by Sam Nestico, Neal Hefti and Quincy 
Jones are as timelessly compelling as big band jazz can be. "Basie Jam" has a 
few surprises: trumpeter Roy Eldridge using a Ben Webster "Cotton Tail" solo; 
he also sings the blues. Superb tenor by Zoot Sims. "Montreux Jam" is a pickup 
album of leftover tracks by groups heard on four of the other CDs. Three 
consecutive cuts (running over a half hour) are based on the blues. Un peu 
trop, n'est-ce pas? 
</P>
<P>
DIZZY GILLESPIE JAM OJCCD 381-2 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
ROY ELDRIDGE 4 OJCCD 373-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of trumpets are heard: Gillespie, 59, and Jon Faddis, 23, on 
the first; Eldridge, then 66, and the link between Armstrong and Gillespie. As 
in several of these CDs, Granz neglected to give solo credits where there are 
instrumental duplications, but it's probably Dizzy muted and Faddis open on 
"Girl of My Dreams." The ballad medley "Once in a While" sounds like Dizzy, but 
Faddis applies his youthful power to "Here's That Rainy Day." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement, unique raspy tone and incredible tension of Eldridge are so 
well represented that for those unfamiliar with his work (he stopped playing 
after a 1980 stroke, and died this year), this may be a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
BENNY CARTER 4 OJCCD 374-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
EDDIE (LOCKJAW) DAVIS 4 OJCCD 384-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
Carter's alto sax is a model of form and tonal beauty; as a bonus, he plays the 
first chorus of "Body and Soul" on trumpet with the same exquisite lyricism. 
Davis (1922-1986) had a tenor sax sound that was mordant, almost indignant; 
here he tears into some well-selected songs: "The Breeze and I," "I Wished on 
the Moon," "Angel Eyes." Flawless backup by Peterson, Brown and Jimmie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
JOE PASS OJCCD 382-2 ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
RAY BRYANT OJCCD 371-2 *** 
</P>
<P>
Pass must be judged by his own five-star standards. This was supposed to be an 
all-blues album, but after 20 minutes of blues, presumably bored, he switched 
to old songs. He has many solo sessions that came off far better. Ray Bryant, 
in a solo piano set, runs smoothly enough through standards, blues and the 
like, though his attempt at gospel ("If I Could Just Make It to Heaven") never 
reaches that Ray Charles plateau. (Note: Fantasy Records at 10th and Parker, 
Berkeley, CA 94710 is the distributor for Pablo, founded and formerly owned by 
Granz.)

POP EYE: POISON'S METAL HERO SHOWS HUMAN SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Projecting an image of toughness is important in the macho world of metal and 
hard rock. Metal heroes are supposed to be invincible, with no chinks in the 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Michaels, the lead singer of the popular metal band Poison, knows the 
rules of the game and has decided to scrap them. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels, 26, has agreed to appear on the cover of the September issue of 
American Diabetes Forecast, a monthly magazine published by the American 
Diabetes Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing about rock 'n' roll is to put on this fake macho image, but 
there's nothing wrong with having a human side," said Michaels, who has had 
insulin-dependent diabetes for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Poison's glam-metal look, Michaels told Pop Eye: "That image is 
part of me and speaking about diabetes is part of me. I don't separate the two. 
I would have done it whether I was in Poison or not." 
</P>
<P>
Though such celebrities as jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie have appeared on the 
cover of the 250,000-circulation Forecast, many pop and rock stars have been 
reluctant to go public with this and other health conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sherman Holvey, president of the American Diabetes Assn., said that this 
reluctance is rooted in fear of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had celebrities say that they preferred not to be identified for fear 
that they wouldn't get a job or insurance or that they would be looked at as 
being less capable as a result of having the condition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the feature interview, Michaels told writer Marcia Mazur that he tests his 
blood sugar anywhere from six to 10 times a day. "I have to know where my 
sugars are at all times because I have such a weird schedule," he said. "Some 
days I get up at nine, some days at one. But I do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
The story also quotes a doctor on the dangers to diabetics of tattoos -- of 
which Michaels, like many metal heroes, has several. "I may have tattoos, but 
I'm not telling anyone else to get them," Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
Holvey said that the main value of the piece is to young diabetics who may be 
fans of Poison, whose most recent album, "Open Up and Say . . . Ahh!," has sold 
nearly 5 million copies and has yielded five Top 20 singles. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows them to know that even people who keep erratic schedules and live in 
the tumult of the kind of life he leads can keep themselves in good diabetes 
regulation," Holvey said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Michaels recalled reading stories when he was growing up about 
how Ron Santo, third baseman for the Chicago Cubs in the '60s and early '70s, 
coped with his diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you kind of look up to these people, you listen to what they say," 
Michaels said. "And mostly, it's just knowing that somebody else out there has 
the same condition you do."

NOTEBOOK: ST. MARK'S: 'RESTAURANT FIRST AND A JAZZ CLUB AFTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The patron saint of Venice, Italy, is San Marco -- Saint Mark. Who knows who's 
the patron saint of L.A.'s Venice, but an extravagant restaurant and jazz club, 
scheduled to open here in mid-September, has borrowed the good saint's name. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mark's is the work of Francois Petit (former manager of Venice's West Beach 
Cafe and Rebecca's) and two partners, Mike Quinn and Warner Scharf. Architect 
Osvaldo Maiozzi (designer of Pazzia on La Cienega) has been hired to create a 
dramatic 200-seat interior done up with black granite, stainless steel and 
cobalt-blue suede booths. Roughly $300,000 has been spent on sound, video and 
lighting systems. And to cook? French chef Gil Saulnier (Le St. Germain's last 
chef before it closed) assisted by former Spago chef Lisa Stalvy. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is very important," Petit stresses. "This is a restaurant first and a 
jazz club after." The style of cooking, he says, will be part northern Italian, 
part southern French and part California nouvelle. "Pas de heavy sauce, pas de 
stuff like that," he says. "It will be tres light." Dinner will be served seven 
nights a week from 6 to 10 p.m. and supper nightly from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., with 
brunch on weekends but no weekday lunch. Petit estimates dinner prices at $6-12 
for appetizers, $16-$22 for main courses, $5-$8 for desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the acts already booked for St. Mark's are Spencer Davis, Billy Preston, 
Freddie Hubbard, Tito Puente, Joe Pass, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Jon 
Hendrix, Larry Coryell, and Kenny Rankin -- and, says Petit: "I am trying, 
trying, trying to get Ray Charles." Maybe he should pray to you-know-who. 
</P>
<P>
THE MEDITERRANEAN IS THE MESSAGE: Alberto Liano wants to make sure people 
understand him correctly. His corporation, which also owns Il Giardino in 
Beverly Hills and Pane Caldo in West Hollywood, has just purchased 1000 
Wilshire in Santa Monica, and renamed it 1000 Wilshire Ristorante. But the menu 
will not be exclusively Italian, he says. It will be based instead on the 
so-called Mediterranean Diet, lately acclaimed by nutritional experts for its 
various health-saving characteristics. But, he adds -- and this is what he 
wants to make sure that people understand -- "This is not a diet with diet 
food." It's a diet in the sense of a style of eating, common to peoples all 
over the Mediterranean region -- a style that concentrates on seafood, pasta, 
grains, fresh vegetables, olive oil, and wine, and goes easy on saturated fats 
and other dietary nasties. Sort of like, oh, Italian food, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
FRONTIERS IN FOOD SERVICE: Rod Gardiner, president of the Gardiner Group, which 
owns Hy's in Century City, the Kobe Japanese Steak House in Palm Springs, and a 
branch of each of the two in Hawaii, has opened a new place in Honolulu. Called 
Banditos Cantina Hawaii, it is said to feature "Hawaiian NuMex" cuisine. For 
instance? For instance, a tofu burrito and chicken satay with 
coconut-mint-chipotle chile peanut sauce. Banditos also offers "tequila-shot 
gals armed with shot-glass belts and tequila-holding holsters." 
</P>
<P>
A SPOT MORE PIZZA?: Imagine Spago with plenty of room, no waits for tables, and 
pizzas in the $4 to $6 range -- oh, and no celebrities. Sound impossible? Well, 
it isn't. It's just English. According to the latest issue of the 
Santa-Barbara-based Entree newsletter, there is a small but popular trattoria 
called Spago in London. The owner, Roman-born Angelo Felici, told Entree that 
he has never heard of Spago in Los Angeles and that he calls his place that 
"because we do spaghetti -- spago is short for spaghetti." (Well, actually, 
spago means string or cord and the word spaghetti, which means little strings 
or cords, is derived from it -- but never mind.) 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Puck, proprietor of L.A.'s own Spago, notes that he doesn't think 
there's much that he can do about the London restaurant -- and that, anyway, it 
sounds like a small place, probably not worth worrying about. "It's funny, 
though," he adds. "Somebody from London, not this same man, tried so hard to 
get me to open a Spago there a little while ago, and he bothered and bothered 
me about it. I said I didn't think the timing was right and that, anyway, I had 
too many restaurants in California already. Then he came over here to see me 
and to go to Spago for the first time, and he didn't like it. He walked out. He 
said it was too noisy, and he had to go someplace more quiet for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
STARS A LA CARTE: Pee-wee Herman and Adam Ant like Cafe Mambo. Shirley MacLaine 
gets soul food (for her well-traveled soul) at Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch. Tony 
Danza, Rob Lowe and Sean Penn hang out at Twenty/20. (Wow! Party time!) The 
casts of "General Hospital" and "Days of Our Lives" may frequently be seen at 
Ocean Avenue Seafood. . . . That's the kind of information, anyway, that we get 
from a new little pamphlet-sized restaurant guide called "Celebrity Hideaways." 
The guide lists about 50 restaurants and clubs around L.A. -- but instead of 
cataloguing dishes served, it tells us who (supposedly) eats where. It is a 
guide not for the hungry so much as for the star-crazed. New Yorkers, who 
generally believe that L.A. restaurant patrons care about seeing and being seen 
more than about what's on their plate, will probably love it. And they can get 
a copy, too, by sending $2 to Celebrity Hideaways, P.O. Box 241823, Los Angeles 
90024. 
</P>
<P>
ROLL-PLAYING: One of the more popular items served at sushi bars in the L.A. 
area is the so-called California Roll made with crabmeat and avocado -- two 
products for which California is well-known. So what do you suppose you might 
find if you sat down at a Japanese restaurant called Sakura, in Huntsville, 
Ala.? Why, Alabama Roll, of course. Made with catfish and pork cracklings? 
Peanuts? Corn? Nope. Made with those good old Alabama specialties: smoked 
salmon, caviar, and, er, avocado. 
</P>
<P>
ON TODAY'S MENU: Old West chow is on the fire at two Silverlake-Los Feliz area 
restaurants today. Broiled rattlesnake, cold cactus and pan-fried brook trout 
are just some of the "hip cowboy food" fixin's on L.A. Nicola's five-course 
dinner, which will be served with a tasting of seven beers ($40 per person). At 
Duplex, it's a Cinderblock Buster with barbecued beef and pork ribs, hot links 
and chicken, complete with cole slaw made from a recipe handed down to chef 
Mark Carter by his own Granny Cohen. . . . And Gilliland's in Santa Monica 
presents a "Pacific Flavors" dinner today from 6 p.m., pairing wines from the 
top Alsatian producer Hugel &amp; Fils with recipes from Asian food expert Hugh 
Carpenter. Sample combination: Thai fried dumplings with coconut milk and basil 
plus 1986 Gewurztraminer. 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Coffee expert Tim Castle will offer a one-day course at 
UCLA Extension, Sept. 16, called "Understanding, Tasting, and Appreciating 
Coffee" -- a course I would highly recommend, incidentally, to a great number 
of restaurateurs hereabouts. Call (213) 206-8120 for details. . . . Alice 
Waters of Chez Panisse and Cafe Fanny in Berkeley, who might genuinely be 
called the mother of contemporary American cooking (with Julia Child, I 
suppose, being the grandmother), teaches and prepares special meals Oct. 7-8 
for the Great Chefs at the Robert Mondavi Winery program. Cost is $595 per 
person, not including lodging or transportation. For further informationcall 
(707) 944-2866.

PICTURE OF A NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her article, "The Temptation of Political Theatre," Sylvie Drake discusses 
at length Vaclav Havel's "Temptation," currently playing at the Mark Taper 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever it is worth, at a recent performance a Czech journalist sought me 
out to say how accurate a picture the play drew of Czechoslovakia and how 
strongly he connected to it. Ms. Drake comments that "Temptation" "never gets 
specific." For us the play is very specific: a visceral portrait of life in 
Czechoslovakia right now. 
</P>
<P>
One also must take issue with Dan Sullivan's take on Mark Harelik as the "wrong 
actor" to play Foustka. As Harelik is creating a role not bound by definitive 
realizations of either the part or the play, it seems presumptuous to define 
the "type" of actor appropriate to it. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper has brought "Temptation" to Los Angeles because we feel that it is an 
important play for our time written by an important writer who continues to 
create art heroically out of the specific experience of life in Czechoslovakia 
and who cannot benefit from the normal collaborative process by which plays are 
brought to life. If the play leaves some audiences and critics unsatisfied and 
unresolved, that is a true and honest representation of the state of affairs 
under which this brave man and his countrymen now live.

CONSIDERING THE TRIBULATIONS OF 'PARENTHOOD'

<P>
Oh puh-leeze!! Since when is a film about family life necessarily intended for 
family viewing? Didn't any of these letter writers ever see "The Godfather," 
"Long Day's Journey Into Night?" or "Splendor in the Grass?" 
</P>

Regarding Calendar's Parental Film Guide (criticized by letter writer Baker), 
we think that the comment "adult themes but good for teens" means just what it 
says, and that any teen would get a lot out of the film. (Unlike Baker, we 
don't consider teens to be small children, and we're certain most teens would 
agree with us.)

MICHAEL'S MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Kiel, please do some research before you go shooting your mouth off about 
the alleged meaning of someone's song (Letters, Aug. 13). If you would really 
listen to George Michael's songs, you might realize he is trying to promote 
monogamous relationships, not portray "explicit sexual imagery" (that borders) 
on the pornographic."

The film's promoters probably alienated many by published remarks to the effect

The convoluted non-thinking of Kris Parker and Steve Hochman is amazing. 
Hochman's idea is that Parker's lyrics send "a powerful black pride message." 
</P>
<P>
Those lyrics are based on Parker's nonsensical notion that the Bible supports 
him. Hell, the Bible supports anything; it all depends on the interpreter. 
Remember, Hitler was a Christian, and so was Jim Jones.

CONSIDERING THE TRIBULATIONS OF 'PARENTHOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Marilyn Brown's Aug. 13 letter condemning the ad for the film "Parenthood" 
that depicts Steve Martin holding two children upside down by their ankles: Oh, 
thank the Lord! Yet another repressed individual with a pen and a stamp has 
done us a public service, demanding this ad be withdrawn because of the 
potential hazards of holding a child upside down. 
</P>
<P>
Let me finish the list: If Rhett really held Scarlett as he did in the "Gone 
With the Wind" poster, she would have developed scoliosis; if Robin Williams 
had been dropped as he was being carried in the ad for "Dead Poet's Society," 
he could have knocked out a tooth; if Dennis Quaid had fallen off the piano in 
"Great Balls of Fire" he could have suffered a brain aneurysm, causing him to 
dress like a giant bat and fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to stop dropping our mouths over rock lyrics, to stop writing 
complaints to "Married With Children," to stop being so uptight. As 
"Parenthood" suggests, roll with life; lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
I remember when my father used to hold me upside down -- and I smile.

2 SURVIVE CRASH OF VINTAGE PLANE IN LOT NEAR HAWTHORNE AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot who wanted to show spectators that his pre-World War II aircraft could 
still fly was cut and bruised Saturday when his two-passenger plane crashed 
into an empty parking lot a block from a Hawthorne air show, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Krattiger, 49, and his wife, Pat, 43, of Valencia were taken to Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center's trauma unit for treatment but neither was 
believed to be seriously hurt, said Battalion Chief Bruce Bradford of the 
Hawthorne Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Ryan PT-22 apparently experienced engine oil problems as it 
approached the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, said Leo Gay, the air show's 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Had the plane not veered off to the north of the runway when it was coming 
down, it very likely would have crashed into parking lots crowded with cars 
belonging to air show visitors on busy 120th Street or on Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, witnesses said, the pilot appeared to turn the aircraft north just 
before crashing. The plane hit an empty parking lot, tore a small bus stop 
shelter from its pilings and came to rest against a chain link fence, its 
yellow wings crumpled and its silver and yellow nose gear heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a very good decision," Gay said. "It was not a crash. It was a forced 
landing." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the Krattigers pulled themselves from the wreckage before help 
arrived. "They were very lucky," Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
No aerial acrobatics are performed at the annual Hawthorne Air Faire, but 
vintage and modern planes fly in and out. They are on exhibit while on the 
ground. Gay estimated that 7,000 people attended the show Saturday. It resumes 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Sgt. Henry Mashack said the pilot apparently wanted to show 
spectators that the plane could still fly and had circled the air field before 
the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Spectators said the prop (propeller) had stopped before the plane came down," 
said Robert Trimborn, Hawthorne airport manager. 
</P>
<P>
The air show was not interrupted by the incident.

'RELIEF' SPECIALISTS CLEAR SOUTHLAND FREEWAY TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15,000 feet above Los Angeles, Bill Ward and Mike Werner rush to get the 
city to work on time. 
</P>
<P>
Slipping through smoggy morning skies in their California Highway Patrol 
chopper, the two officers scan the snarls that paralyze stretches of the city's 
busiest freeways, their eyes hunting for the impediments that can transform the 
freeways into linear parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Three miles below and nearly 10 miles west, CHP Officer Tyrone Johnson launches 
a similar hunt -- his from the heart of the snarls. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a minor accident or one stalled car," said Johnson, his patrol 
car speeding along the shoulder of the northbound San Diego Freeway toward a 
disabled taxi. "If we don't hurry up and get to it, it can back up the freeway 
for miles. . . . That's why we can't take a break. If we do, there could be 
some serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
For three hours a day, Monday through Friday, these officers are in the 
vanguard of Operation CLEAR -- Clearing Lanes Efficiently and Rapidly -- the 
CHP's latest assault on Los Angeles traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Operation CLEAR is a six-month pilot program aimed at locating and removing 
traffic obstructions on targeted portions of the San Bernardino, Santa Ana and 
San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Its success hinges on the chopper, 16 to 18 patrol cars and motorcycles, a 
fleet of tow trucks and CHP officers such as Werner, Ward and Johnson, 
"congestion relief" specialists who do little else for three hours but pinpoint 
and remove traffic obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
During shifts that last from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 6 
p.m., the officers must ensure that streams of tens of thousands of cars, 
trucks and motorcycles flow smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response Time 
</P>
<P>
And when something disrupts that traffic flow, they want to find it within 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Response time is so important because every minute of response time translates 
into miles of back-up and millions of dollars in time wasted in the middle of 
traffic," said Mike Maas, a CHP spokesman. "That's why 10 minutes is our 
targeted maximum response time." 
</P>
<P>
According to CHP statistics for July, the Operation CLEAR ground units 
responded in an average of 6 minutes, 20 seconds to 791 impediments on the 
selected freeways. Officers ran across another 959 incidents without 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officials said the agency didn't gauge response time before Operation 
CLEAR, but admitted that it needed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"CLEAR has gone a long way in improving response time," said Dale Perron, a 
transportation engineer for the California Department of Transportation. 
"Before, it would take officers a lot longer than 10 minutes to get to a 
problem on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Although freeway traffic has yet to flow as smoothly as it did during the 1984 
Olympics, some believe this effort to accelerate response time has cut freeway 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Difference' 
</P>
<P>
"I have a noticed a big difference in clearing time," said Jim Thornton, a 
radio traffic reporter for the Metro Traffic Control news service. "(The CHP 
officers) are moving obstructions faster, and I see the tow trucks getting 
there faster." 
</P>
<P>
To better response time, pilots and ground units have developed distinct 
methods of locating traffic impediments. 
</P>
<P>
While Johnson undauntingly cruises the freeway shoulders and side streets that 
skirt his beat -- the stretch of the San Diego Freeway between Manchester 
Avenue and Imperial Highway, near Los Angeles International Airport -- the 
chopper pilots rely heavily on intuition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's instinctive," said Ward as he guided the helicopter over a congested 
strip of the Santa Monica freeway. "If you chase calls (from the dispatcher), 
you'll fall behind real quick. We try to do this in a pro-active mode, go to 
the areas where we anticipate problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots, who also monitor the Pasadena, Santa Monica, Harbor and Golden 
State freeways, said radio traffic reports are vital to their air search, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shared Information 
</P>
<P>
"We pass information back and forth with them (radio reporters)," Werner said. 
"It's beneficial for both of us and the radio stations. We'll check out 
something they may have heard about and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
Although he often discovers accidents and stalled cars by cruising the 
freeways, Johnson depends primarily on a central dispatch center located in the 
CHP's Hollywood office to alert him to obstructions on his beat. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me about something over (a CB in the patrol car), and if it's on my 
beat, I can go over the shoulders or take side streets to get there," he said. 
"Sometimes I just have to stick out traffic if I don't know where exactly the 
problem is." 
</P>
<P>
Ward noted that sometimes the dispatchers receive and mistakenly transmit false 
alarms, forcing ground units to squander several precious minutes searching for 
a nonexistent obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this, he said, the chopper pilots sometimes fly ahead of ground units 
and look for possible trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spot Check 
</P>
<P>
Zipping away from a spot where a pickup truck was falsely reported to have 
overturned, Ward estimated the amount of time that his spot check of the area 
had just saved a ground unit. 
</P>
<P>
"That was about 15 minutes saved," Ward said. "(CHP cruisers) would have come 
all the way out here and found nothing. Now, they can just stay on their beat 
and find a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic-stoppers can assume a myriad of forms, Johnson said, but none is as 
common as the "looky-loos," drivers who turn traffic accidents into a spectator 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The stalled cars really can hold up traffic," he said. "One reason is because 
they stop in the middle of the freeway, but another, big reason is because 
people like to stop and look at them." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said gawkers tend to cause most of the backups on freeways, so much so 
that he tries not give them anything to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he ran interference between traffic and a stranded motorcyclist walking 
his Harley-Davidson to the freeway shoulder, Johnson's disdain for looky-loos 
was evident. 
</P>
<P>
"Got any gas?" screamed the stranded biker, Frank Strock, to Johnson. "I need 
some gas!" 
</P>
<P>
"Just move to the side," urged Johnson, his voice drowning in the roar of 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gawker's Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
"All I need is some gas!" repeated Strock. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, move as far to the side as you can," shot back Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Then, turning to a passenger, the CHP officer said: "I don't want to give these 
people anything to look at. They will stare at anything." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cut down on such gawking, the highway patrol has encouraged 
drivers with cellular car phones to call in locations of obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has also promoted car-pooling to cut down on congestion, but Los 
Angeles drivers have been slow to respond to this suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just not into car-pooling out here," Johnson said. "If you could get 
people to do that, you could cut down on a lot of traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, said KNX radio traffic reporter Bill Keene, the impact of CLEAR is 
being felt. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to get reports of stalled cars and people would be out on the roads 
sometimes for 45 minutes," Keene said. "Now, it seems, they're moving much 
faster."

'I KNEW THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WOULD BE TO TEACH THEM TO TRUST EACH OTHER.' -- 
SALLY GORDON; 
</P>
<P>
GANG MEMBERS GET LESSONS IN LIVING IN CAMP ACTING CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As serene music wafted through the gymnasium, the teen-age actors began their 
improvisations as sea creatures and their blind offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Some scrambled along the floor clutching their colleagues, picking up imaginary 
food and feeding it to them. Others circled gracefully around the room like 
fish, holding tightly to partners to keep them from banging into walls or 
stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
That the young thespians are showing such creativity is exciting to Sally 
Gordon, who has taught drama for 20 years. But what continues to amaze her day 
after day is that they are willing to interact with each other at all. 
</P>
<P>
For it has been only recently that these kids were interacting in a 
terrifyingly different way -- going at each other with knives, guns and fists 
in the city's mean and deadly gang wars. But here in the Angeles Crest Forest 
at Camp Karl Holton, the county's highest security probation camp, the system's 
most difficult juvenile felons are learning to develop their sensitive and 
creative sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Program 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who created the pilot program for the probation camp's high school, 
says that sometimes while watching her students perform, she finds it almost 
unbelievable that they are here for a variety of juvenile court offenses -- 
drug sales, robberies, burglaries, drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very moved by them," said Gordon, who is director of Firebird 
Theater Company, which received a grant from the Los Angeles City Cultural 
Affairs Department to try the workshop this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 students were chosen for the class by camp officials after they 
volunteered that they were interested in the activity. But getting the former 
rivals to leave their gang affiliations behind "didn't happened overnight," 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
At the first class session, the juveniles slouched around the room, flashed 
sneers and gang signs at each other and were reluctant to participate. 
</P>
<P>
When Gordon brought out a large rack of clothes to be used for costumes, 
anything red and blue -- colors of Blood and Crips gangs -- went first. They 
tied scarfs around their heads and dangled them from their back pockets to 
signal gang affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Safe Place 
</P>
<P>
But Gordon and her two assistants, actresses Andrea Iaderosa and Violette 
Winge, kept emphasizing that the class was a safe place, a place where they 
could leave the gang-banging outside and not be laughed at or hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The class is monitored at all times by a probation officer, but there have been 
no reports of physical confrontations among the actors. "They are expected to 
act like gentlemen and scholars at all times on campus, the class is no 
exception," said Sue Thomsen, principal of the camp's high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the biggest challenge would be to teach them to trust each other," said 
Gordon, explaining why she could not start in with full-blown dramatic 
presentations. Instead, the students were flung into improvisational work in 
which they had to depend on each other. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, most dropped "their tough-guy roles" and pretended to be floating 
balloons, South American villagers, royalty living on the moon. They were 
encouraged to write poetry and draw pictures to illustrate their roles. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids never had childhoods, never played pretend. It was a whole 
new world to them," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crying Sea Creature 
</P>
<P>
After one ocean skit, 17-year-old Rubin, who was convicted of armed robbery and 
selling drugs, drew a picture of a crying sea creature. "His mermaid left him 
forever, he was very sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I felt dumb doing the stuff and the guys were making faces at each 
other. But now the home boys ignore the other gang-bangers. In here, I don't 
mess with them and they don't mess with me." 
</P>
<P>
The workshop ends this month, and Gordon has been searching unsuccessfully for 
additional grant money to keep the project going. While her two assistants have 
been paid, Gordon said, she has donated her own time to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon organized Firebird Theater Company 10 years ago to present innovative 
performances to children citywide. But recently she has focused on 
participatory workshops such as this one. She would also like to start a 
similar program for juveniles still on the streets if she can find donated 
space for classes. 
</P>
<P>
Thomsen said school officials have been pleased with the program. "It gives 
these kids the opportunity to finally let go of some of that gang influence." 
</P>
<P>
One of the workshop's students recently graduated from the camp high school and 
will attend a community college. "He told me he wanted to study acting because 
of what he had experienced here," Gordon said. "It was a real thrill to hear 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But all are not success stories. 
</P>
<P>
"When some of them have been touched profoundly, they back off," Gordon said. 
"Some are so afraid of their feelings, to change, to believe the good stuff 
about themselves, they fear they can't do it again." 
</P>
<P>
And she worries about what will happen after they are released from the 
probation camp. "Many of them don't have anywhere to go except back to the old 
neighborhood. I just hope they will take some of this with them." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, the students were playing out the various milestones that 
fathers and sons go through in a lifetime, making up dialogue as they saw fit. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner, William, a 16-year-old confessed burglar, was lying prostrate on 
the floor, pretending to be a father gasping his last breath. His "son" was 
played by Mario, a 16-year-old who in real life was arrested for assault and 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad, you look pale, I love you Dad," Mario cried convincingly. "Remember all 
those drug busts I didn't get busted for because you were there? Now, I'll get 
you flowers, and a preacher and the best church in town for your funeral." 
</P>
<P>
Then the classmates, still in character, wrote farewell letters. Mario's letter 
to William said, in part, "Dad, remember the fun we had. That is a part of 
loving and caring." William, in turn wrote to Mario, "My son, it is not easy to 
say goodby, it's not easy to let you go." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the juvenile offenders sat in a circle and discussed their skits. 
William shyly volunteered, "I thought it must take a lot of responsibility to 
be a father and take care of kids from beginning to end." Mario said that he 
liked the scene where he left home and he and William, his pretend dad, hugged. 
"I never done that before when I was home." 
</P>
<P>
He added that in another scene in which he was jailed and William became very 
distraught, it suddenly occured to him, "Is this what my parents went through 
when I was in jail?"

OFFICERS MOURN VETERAN POLICE DOG KILLED BY CAR THEFT SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers Saturday mourned the death of Marko, a German 
shepherd who helped collar 243 criminal suspects in his five years as a police 
dog before being stabbed in the neck last week by a car theft suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Marko was buried at a local pet cemetery Saturday morning, Officer Glen Schnoor 
said. He died about 9 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all pretty upset. It's like losing a member of the family," Schnoor

Officers had stood vigil inside a veterinary clinic, hoping for a miracle 
recovery for the 85-pound dog, which was on a life-support system late Friday.

"Marko is not a human being, but he is about as close as you can get," said 
Police Lt. Mike Hillmann. "You're talking about a relationship that is very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Marko's handler, Officer Sal Apodaca, had worked with the dog on hundreds of 
cases since Marko joined the force in 1984, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Marko was stabbed late Thursday after tracking a suspected car thief to a house 
in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officers used tear gas to flush Myra Wright, 27, from beneath the house, police 
said. Wright, whose address was not immediately known, was arrested for 
investigation of felony auto theft and harming a police dog, Hillmann said.

WHAT KILLED L.A.'S ONLY COMMERCIAL CLASSICAL STATION AND WHAT'S NEXT

<P>
The KFAC story has had more fake endings than a Beethoven symphony. 
</P>
<P>
After months of speculation and denials that the radio station, which began 
broadcasting classical music in 1931, was going the rock/pop route, it's now a 
certainty that it will. Los Angeles will soon be the only city in the United 
States with more that a million in population that does not have a commercial 
classical music station. 
</P>
<P>
No official announcement of the change has been made, but a recent visit to the 
station, in a former swank Hollywood restaurant, was all that is needed to 
confirm that the transition is surely afoot. 
</P>
<P>
Within sight of a large banner that reads, "What Have You Done For Your Station 
Today?" newly hired salespeople dressed in natty outfits and sporting stylish 
haircuts scurried about, popping into each other's offices and making 
urgent-sounding phone calls. In the midst of all this activity the more 
sedately attired on-air personalities greeted each other with the bemusement 
and resignation of lame ducks as they quietly went about their daily task of 
putting classical music on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Music director Bob Wennersten was packing up his papers to make way for someone 
new in his office when Robert Goldfarb, the current vice president for 
programming and operations, stopped by. With a smile, Wennersten handed him the 
September music schedule prepared for Ovation, the magazine that has been 
publishing KFAC's music lineup for several years. "Here's the last one," 
Wennersten said, pointing out to Goldfarb the last two days of the month. For 
those two days Wennersten had programmed, at the end of every disc jockey's 
shift, a rendition of Haydn's Symphony No. 45, better known as the "Farewell" 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad it won't ever happen," Goldfarb said, shaking his head. "Nobody here 
really believes we will get that far." 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb, who has been in classical music radio for 20 years, speculates the 
changeover will come sometime after Labor Day but before Sept. 21, when the 
fall radio ratings period begins. 
</P>
<P>
There are no outward signs at KFAC that the change is the result of the station 
falling on hard times. The station is carpeted, well-appointed and in seemingly 
good repair, and some of the offices could even be called plush. Indeed, one of 
the ironies of this situation is that KFAC has been making a respectable, 
steady profit for years. 
</P>
<P>
But in the age of deregulation, mega-mergers and leveraged buyouts, that is 
simply not enough. Big-city radio is shaping up as one of the modern, 
high-finance battlefields upon which there is little room for merely 
respectable profits. The casuality of the battle might well be all-classical 
commercial radio, just at a time when public radio is wandering further and 
further from its original commitment to classical. It's a prospect that has 
produced angry statements from local culture administrators and hundreds of 
letters from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is not entirely bleak. Commercial classical radio is doing fine in 
several smaller cities, including Bakersfield, and a new breed of programmers 
is confident that, properly marketed, commercial classical radio can still hold 
its own, even in the big cities. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry observers firmly believe that Los Angeles will not be without an 
all-classical station for long. 
</P>
<P>
From 1962 to 1989, the selling price of KFAC-AM and FM rose more than 3,187%. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is a measure of how much the business of radio in general, and 
classical music radio in particular, has changed. In 1962, KFAC was bought by 
Cleveland Broadcasting for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Classical music radio was not a wildly exciting business back then, but a 
well-run station could build a loyal following and provide its owners with a 
tidy, long-term profit. As radio entered the 1980s, the profits became more 
than tidy. 
</P>
<P>
"Classical radio stations are riding a prosperity wave," Billboard magazine 
reported in 1983, "racking up billing gains of 10% to 45% compared to a year 
ago." The magazine attributed much of the gain to listener interest in compact 
discs, which classical stations experimented with when the technology was 
relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the trade publication Television/Radio Age heralded the demographics 
of the classical radio audience -- generally thought to be a more affluent 
group than pop music listeners -- saying that the format was "a classic forged 
in marketing stone." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest developments in radio in the 1980s, however, came not from 
advertisers, who were increasingly turning to radio as TV ad time became 
astronomically expensive, but from the government. The Federal Communications 
Commission eliminated in 1982 its "three-year rule," which stipulated that the 
buyers of a radio station had to wait at least three years before reselling. 
</P>
<P>
"When the three-year rule was in effect, you had to be an operator, not just a 
banker out to make a quick killing on a resale," said Matthew Field, senior 
vice president and general manager of WNCN, one of two commercial classical 
stations in New York City. "The rule was based on the idea that radio licenses 
were given in the public interest and were not just a commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, radio stations became an attractive target to those playing the 
high-stakes financial game of the 1980s -- leveraged buyouts. Classical 
stations, with their modest profits, were judged to be particularly desirable 
to speculators looking for a relatively low-priced entry into radio ownership. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, TV/Radio Age was admitting that classical music radio was "facing some 
unsettling times" and warned that "many feel it is being threatened, by both 
outside and inside entrepreneurs whose ambition to turn a high profit is 
primary." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting for takeovers, some classical station owners, including ones 
in Houston, Phoenix and Boulder, Colo., changed format themselves and went in 
search of the pop/rock fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Classical music lovers feared that when KFAC changed owners in 1986 it would 
soon be given a new format. But the new owners, Louise Heifetz -- then a sales 
executive at rock station KIIS and daughter-in-law of violinist Jascha Heifetz 
-- and Edward Argow, who together bought the AM-FM station for $33.5 million, 
announced it would remain classical. 
</P>
<P>
They did sell the AM outlet for $8.75 million to a Spanish-language broadcaster 
in 1988, but the vast majority of KFAC's listeners were tuned to FM anyway. And 
after an initial rough period in which they replaced several beloved announcers 
who had been at the station for decades, the fortunes of KFAC seemed to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
Although its share ratings was in the "low 1s" at the time of the 1986 
takeover, Goldfarb said, they rose impressively to as high as 1.9. (The latest 
ratings survey by Birch/Scarborough Research showed KFAC with a 1.7 share, 
which means that about 1.7% of all listeners were tuned to the station when a 
15-minute sampling was taken. KUSC-FM, the non-commercial L.A. station that 
programs mostly classical music, had a 1.3 share.) 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb also said that the operating profit was holding steady at $2 million 
to $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, when the Heifetz administration was at KFAC, other L.A. stations 
were getting caught up in buyout mania. KRTH-AM and FM sold for $86 million, 
KROQ-FM for $83 million and KTWV-FM (the Wave) and KJOI-FM for about $75 
million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most significant sale involved KIQQ-FM, a soft-rock broadcaster 
sold in 1988 for $56 million to a company that clearly intended to change its 
format. 
</P>
<P>
"With that sale we basically set a new 'stick price' level for an L.A. FM," 
said Gary Stevens, one of the top radio station brokers in the country. Stick, 
in radio circles, is slang for antenna, and the "stick price" is the cost of 
acquiring the right to get a license and put up a stick, as it were. The buyers 
of KIQQ were not interested in its current programming. They were willing to 
pay those millions just to get an L.A. stick. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not an outrageous price," said Stevens, speaking from a hotel room in 
London, where he was on vacation. "These stations had been undervalued for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
The new owners transformed KIQQ into KQLZ and made a frontal assault on the 
rock market as "Pirate Radio." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The offer KFAC's owners could not refuse came in late 1988. On Jan. 18, 1989, 
they announced the station had been sold for $55 million, the highest price 
ever paid for a classical music station. 
</P>
<P>
"The station was not on the market," Heifetz said at the time, "but for such an 
incredible amount of money, we thought that it was an offer that deserved 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
As high as the price was, it was clearly a stick price, and although the new 
owners, the Dallas-based Evergreen Media Corp., said the station would remain 
classical, industry observers knew that would not last long. Goldfarb said the 
new owners did consider keeping the station classical, but the numbers just 
didn't add up. KFAC's operating profit of $2 million to $3 million a year was 
far below what was needed to service Evergreen's payments on the debt it took 
on when it bought the station. 
</P>
<P>
"We had enough advertisers," Goldfarb said. "During much of the year our quota 
of ads was virtually full. We just didn't have the audience in sheer numbers to 
justify charging the kind of advertising rate we needed. The bottom line for 
advertisers is their cost-per-thousand listeners." 
</P>
<P>
KFAC charges about $250 for a one-minute ad during the morning drive-time 
period. KPWR-FM, the highest-rated L.A. station, gets about $900 a minute 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee that the new KFAC format will succeed," said WNCN's 
Field. "Rock has gotten very competitive. But with that kind of debt to 
service, they have to risk it." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months ago, the management quietly circulated word among the staff 
that a change would be made away from classical. "So, it is no shock that it is 
finally happening," said Goldfarb, who is one of the employees facing 
joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
When word that KFAC planned a change leaked out to the community, the reaction 
from classical music organizations was sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hemmings, general director of Music Center Opera, noted that KFAC had 
made the public aware of his organization's productions: "They gave us a lot of 
free publicity, played our music, interviewed our people and mentioned our work 
a great deal. We also could advertise on the station and reach our exact target 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was 
angry. "What is at the bottom of this is the crazy leveraged buyout stuff that 
is going on throughout the radio business," he said. "People buy stations with 
no money and then get themselves into such enormous debt that in order to 
service that debt they have to go for the lowest-common-denominator listener." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann does not see KUSC-FM, the mostly classical public station, as a 
good substitute for KFAC. "KFAC has a much clearer, cleaner signal. The sound 
is so much more vivid and goes a lot further," he said. 
</P>
<P>
KFAC broadcasts with 43-kilowatts of power from Mt. Wilson, with an antenna 
whose top is 2,910 feet above sea level. KUSC is licensed to operate with 25 
kilowatts from Flint Peak in Glendale with an antenna height of 667 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann also took KUSC's programming to task. "KFAC was becoming more and 
more interesting. It had begun to treat its audience as rather more intelligent 
human beings, whereas KUSC was going the other way, towards a soft-core 
classical sound." 
</P>
<P>
KUSC officials, who say their station plays classical music 90% of the time, 
had said that they plan to introduce other types of music into their format. 
"It's not going to be radically different, but we have to recognize that there 
are music forms that are shaping the interests and ears of the classical 
audiences of the future," said Wallace Smith, KUSC general manager and 
president. "We have to do things to attract younger audiences to classical 
music. It used to be that they were introduced to it in the public schools, but 
that doesn't happen anymore." Smith said that the changes, which would be 
integrated into the programming gradually, would include playing jazz, film and 
theater music, lighter classics and even some New Age. 
</P>
<P>
KUSC will soon get a boost from KFAC. KFAC will be urging its listeners to tune 
in to KUSC, after donating some of its rarest records to the public radio 
station. KFAC general manager Jim de Castro said he will run $100,000 in 
advertising over the next month on both his station and KUSC to urge KFAC 
listeners to switch over. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be specially produced spots to get out listening audience to 
transfer over from our position on the radio dial to theirs," De Castro said. 
"The spots will say something like, 'You can go find terrific classical music 
that you love with such a passion at KUSC.' " 
</P>
<P>
KUSC's Smith said the chance to pick up some of KFAC's audience -- estimated at 
800,000 -- will be a boon for his station, which has an estimated 318,000 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
One local commercial station has announced that it intends, in the wake of the 
changes at KFAC, to play at least some classical music on a regular basis. The 
owner of KKGO-AM and FM, which have been all-jazz since 1960, said he will 
definitely be programming a jazz and classical mix, although he has backtracked 
from his original announcement that he might put jazz entirely on the AM, with 
the FM reserved for classical during the day and evening hours and jazz late at 
night. That plan whipped up a protest among KKGO's listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We always felt we had a larger audience than the ratings service gave us 
credit for," said Saul Levine, founder and general manager of L.A.'s only 
commercial all-jazz station. "The volume of letters we got proves that." Levine 
said that a mix can't help but upset some listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a little compromise on the part of both," he said. "It's 
like our children. They can't get candy all the time but they get their share 
of it. The overriding thing I am saying is that the city is now in a crisis 
situation, culturally, and that we are going to help relieve that by making 
time for both formats." 
</P>
<P>
It could also help boost his ratings, which have been consistently lower than 
KFAC's. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's plan to mix formats, however, is looked upon with great skepticism by 
industry observers. "No one has successfully mixed two entirely different 
formats in commercial radio, as far as I know," said Edith K. Whaley, a vice 
president at the International Communications Group, one of the major media 
buying services for advertisers on the West Coast. "People tune into a radio 
station for a certain sound. They want to know what they are getting. It's not 
like television, where they tune in for a specific program." 
</P>
<P>
Several consultants said they believe that if Levine does introduce classical 
music onto KKGO, he will eventually have to go with an all-classical format, at 
least on his FM outlet, to make the move commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
If Levine's plans falter, it's likely that another station will step in to give 
classical a try. "I can think of several stations out there that are either not 
profitable at all or marginally profitable," said broker Stevens. "The owners 
might try and take them classical. KUSC's level of profits might be just fine 
for a station that does not have to service a big debt." 
</P>
<P>
KFAC staffers had harbored hopes that a station might still take over their 
format at the last minute, offering them new jobs. But after the new management 
announced that it was giving away the station's library of recordings, it seems 
less likely that any station will step in to buy the format without getting the 
library in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, that even given the high prices, an outsider could buy a 
station here and take on the classical format. If anyone could do that, it is 
Howard Tanger, who is often referred to as the "King of Classical Radio" in 
trade publications. The Boston-based Tanger has bought stations in Detroit, 
Miami and Philadelphia and programmed them successfully with all-classical 
formats that are nothing like anything heard in Los Angeles. "It's a 
contemporary presentation," he said. "High promotion, high visibility, 
contests, promotions. It's like a high-energy rock station except that we play 
only classical music." 
</P>
<P>
WNCN's Field said that the New York station has gone a similar route and even 
has a comedy duo as disc jockeys in the morning. "The other day they did a 
satirical sketch about Jessie Helms passing judgment on 'Romeo and Juliet,' " 
he said. "The audience loves it." WNCN-FM is now doing better in the ratings 
than the FM service of New York's other commercial classical station, WQXR. 
</P>
<P>
Tanger said he would love to get his hands on a station in Los Angeles. "We 
tried to buy KIQQ a number of years ago but were not successful," he said. 
"Recently we were looking at another deal, but it's now on the back burner." He 
acknowledges that the prices here are high. "A company could manage it if it 
was very well capitalized, had a relatively low debt and a significantly high 
cash flow. And that is our company." 
</P>
<P>
Tanger said his goal is to have classical stations in Los Angeles, New York and 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California classical music fans can only wait, now, to see if there is 
a place for their favorite music in the hot -- some would say overheated -- 
commercial radio economy. In the meantime, smaller metropolises that are often 
considered provincial by the high arts crowd have thriving classical stations. 
</P>
<P>
"Those smaller cities might be the only place commercial classical radio can 
grow, right now," said Maurice Lowenthal, the general manager of a commercial 
classical station owned by the City of Dallas. "Anyone in a big city with a big 
signal is so vulnerable. I think that in a few years many of the big-city 
classical stations will be no more. But look at what is happening out your way. 
There is a new station in Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Duffy, in radio since 1945, put KIWI-FM on the air in Bakersfield in 
February, 1986, as a 24-hour, all-classical station. He had never owned or 
worked at a classical outlet. He didn't have a particular fondness for the 
music. "Country and Western is the big thing, and if you go up against the big 
station owned by Buck Owens up here, you are in for a dogfight," Duffy said. 
"When I went on the air with classical, I got no resistance from the other 
stations. I think they even touted us. 'Bakersfield is now such a big town it 
has a classical station,' they would say." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy found an economical way to operate. Except for a disc jockey who does a 
weeknight show, all of KIWI's music and announcements are taped by a service in 
San Francisco that also provides programming to stations in Anchorage and 
Albuquerque. "We don't run it like a radio station," Duffy said. "We don't have 
news, weather, sports or time checks. We just play the music." Commercials are 
inserted by an automated system. "We don't have any high-priced talent, big 
record collections or fancy furniture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy reluctantly admitted that KIWI , with its low costs, does a bit better 
than breaking even, but he wanted to stress that the station was not rolling in 
profits. "I think some people who love cultural things advertise with us 
because they like to help us out," he said. "They take community pride in the 
station." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the big city, Goldfarb was continuing his office rounds at KFAC. He 
pointed out a mural on the outside of the building that depicts KFAC announcers 
intermingling with composers of the ilk of Bach, Beethoven and Verdi. Goldfarb 
hoped the new administration would keep the mural. 
</P>
<P>
But the announcers in the mural are the ones from the post-1986 regime. They 
were the announcers Goldfarb fired. "When I came to KFAC, we did what we needed 
to do, and now the people here are doing what they need to do," he said with a 
smile. "There are people who say it is karmic. You introduce radical changes 
and so your karma in turn requires you to be the object of radical changes. 
Maybe there is something to that." 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb stepped into the studio to see announcer Mary Fain, who had just put 
on a recording of Handel's Concerto a due cori No. 2. They talked a bit about 
what they will do when the format changed. Goldfarb said he will likely do some 
consulting and keep his eye out for a station to buy outside of the major 
markets. He doesn't care if it is not classical. 
</P>
<P>
Fain, who came to KFAC from a classical station in Seattle, said she would like 
to relax a bit and do some writing. And she said she would like very much to 
stay in radio in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb took on the mock tones of an elocution teacher. "Can you say, 'Guns 
'n' Roses?,' " he asked. 
</P>
<P>
They both laughed, and Fain shooed him out of the control room as she prepared 
to introduce a Dvorak string quartet.

<P>
ROBIN HARRIS' DOWN HOME EDGE HAS LAUNCHED HIM FROM THE COMEDY ACT THEATRE TO 
'DO THE RIGHT THING' AND BEYOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entertainment industry -- particularly the comedy part -- is so rife with 
recycled product and self-cannibalism that a genuinely new talent presents an 
almost startling freshness and an instant prize. That has to be one of the 
reasons for the success of Roseanne Barr; it certainly underlies the eager rush 
to make the most of comedian Robin Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Before this summer, Harris, who emcees a lineup of comedians twice a week at a 
club called the Comedy Act Theatre, was one of the unheralded pleasures of the 
black community. A somewhat portly, tough-looking 35-year-old with angry 
bloodshot eyes, he makes none of the standard comedic efforts to ingratiate 
himself to his audience. Instead, he works like someone who genuinely doesn't 
give a damn, an unconscionable gossip pillorying anyone who catches his eye. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't only the black working-class young that dresses up to make the scene 
at the club. Black celebrities, heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and any number 
of professional athletes show up regularly at the Comedy Act to be verbally 
frisked by Harris and snared in his spotlight. Members of the Los Angeles 
Lakers often show up to cool out after a home game. Harris often greets Earvin 
Johnson with the line, "Come on down here to the colored section, Magic." 
Harris' put-upon, playing-the-dozens manner conceals an underlying affection, 
the kind of spirited kidding that goes on when you've come home after being 
away for some time. 
</P>
<P>
But the secret is out now as a different cognoscenti has gotten wind of Robin 
Harris, and things may never be the same as he begins to take on the glossy 
patina of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of '89, he's swinging into the fast lane in overdrive. Spike Lee 
cast him as Sweet Dick Willie, the center of the Greek chorus of street 
signifiers in "Do the Right Thing," and for as long as he was onscreen he 
commanded the movie with his characteristic mix of jive ("Mike Tyson ain't 
nothin'. If I fought Tyson I'd drop him like a bad habit.") and plaintive, 
sardonic wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
He had the forceful ease of the true natural, and everyone took notice. Lee 
immediately recast him in his new movie, "Love Supreme." Harris is wrapping up 
a major role in another feature film called "House Party," written and directed 
by Reggie Hudlin. He's about to cut a comedy album for Polygram Records. He 
showcased at The Roxy in July. And now the attendant TV heavies, mindful of 
what an adrenal rush a strong comedic personality can bring to prime time 
ratings have come courting. Harris' agent says he's met with NBC's Brandon 
Tartikoff, CBS's Barbara Corday, Fox's Lillah McCarthy, and Kim Fleary and Stu 
Bloomberg at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Instant, easy laughter erupts from Harris' club audience as he shocks it with 
self-recognition. His roughness is the expression of a deeper unspoken 
intimacy. He's family. He knows all about the black working class, and the 
struggle to keep body and soul together in the community, and the sexual 
flashpoints and stresses between men and women. He understands the 
pressure-cooker feel of inner-city life, and how quickly its expression can hit 
the sizzle of the media wire that feeds the culture at large. 
</P>
<P>
To enter the club late, or leave early, or stand up for any reason or -- worst 
of all -- to have to make one's way to the stage-right stairs leading to the 
bathroom, is to invite the scourge of Harris' scrutiny, accompanied by a sharp 
spotlight that pins his hapless subjects like deer caught in headlights. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that (expletive) hat, man. It black because she been wearin' it so 
long." 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell the woman who has a job by the way she walks. You can tell a 
virgin, too. Virgins walk like penguins." 
</P>
<P>
"You look good, honey. But that guy with you is ugly." 
</P>
<P>
"Like that suit, brother. It might come back in style." 
</P>
<P>
Harris' tone is so freighted with emphasis that it makes what he says sound 
more vituperative than it actually is. "Hey, you don't look a woman no way." 
"Y'all been to County Hospital? Get yourself some income! Get yourself 
somewhere!" 
</P>
<P>
Recently Spike Lee came to the Comedy Act with saxophonist Branford Marsalis 
and actress Olivia Brown of "Miami Vice," and stepped out in the street for a 
few minutes to talk about Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie Weems is my casting director. She said, 'Spike, you gotta see Robin 
Harris.' I did, and was amazed at his talent. I gave him a lot of latitude to 
make Sweet Dick funny -- I couldn't write that character as funny as Robin 
could. He has a sophisticated country wit. He was born in Chicago and raised in 
L.A., but he reaches way back to Mississippi. His humor is steeped in black 
humor, like Pigmeat Markham and Richard Pryor. He's folks." 
</P>
<P>
Lee had stepped out just after Harris had re-enacted a scene where a white cop 
stops him in a car late one night. "Cop say, 'You got a gun in the car?' 'No, 
it's home with the dope.' " Lee worked his way back to the table to hear Harris 
say: "Rich people are not moody. They always happy. Stocks up, niggahs down, 
great!" Then, to a young man man standing by the stairs: "Whaddayou think of 
Spike Lee?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Spike Lee." 
</P>
<P>
"Where?" 
</P>
<P>
"Right there," said Harris, pointing. 
</P>
<P>
"You jivin'." 
</P>
<P>
"Who you think that is, Mr. Magoo?" 
</P>
<P>
The crowd laughed. "How you doin' in your new movie?" Harris asked Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," Lee mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"Your voice is awful low," Harris said, challengingly. Lee was not comfortable 
with the attention and hunkered down. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' attention shifted to Atlanta Hawks star forward Dominique Wilkins, who 
had come to the club with teammate Spud Webb. Both were in town to play in an 
upcoming benefit basketball game at the Inglewood Forum hosted by Magic 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you at, Dominique?" Harris asked. "Smile, I'll find you." After the 
spotlight caught Wilkins, Harris said: "Michael Jordan be there? Who gonna 
guard him?" Pause. "Not you." The crowd laughed again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the time I played Dominique," Harris mused. "I was at the 
Clippers game. They were short some players. I had my sneakers. Coach called me 
outta the stands to play. I got 18 points, 15 rebounds, 12 assists. Coach said, 
'Can you come back next week?' 'Hell, no! I got somethin' to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on Harris have been such that the day after the show he flew to 
Chicago to be among family and found himself reluctant to return, which meant 
his schedule had become even more compressed when at last he did. By the 
following week's end, he was going on three hours of sleep a night. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of criticism for my act," he said over a prime rib dinner ("well 
done," he told the waiter when ordering. "Like me"). "They say, 'You gonna get 
your ass kicked.' But in all the time I been doin' this, I apologized maybe 
three times. I like to talk stuff people like to hear but are afraid to say." 
</P>
<P>
Harris is at an interesting point in his career at the moment, a seasoned 
performer on the verge of hitting it big but unaware as yet of the subtle traps 
of celebrity. He's cocky, anxious, unguarded, self-absorbed, restless and 
mindful that the changes in his life are becoming palpably swift and harder to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wanna get out of touch with my buddies," he said. "I see some change. 
They look at me different. Like a friend says, 'Can I have your autograph?' I 
think, 'He should not have it. He's known me all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Everybody's on my bandwagon now. People say to me, 'You gonna 
change?' 'Damn right I'm gonna change! I'm movin' from the ghetto to La Brea.' 
I just moved back home with my wife, Exetta. I had problems. Times I'd be 
studyin', I'd be fussin', know what I mean? I can be stronger now. I'm just 
like everybody else who has a family and has to drive 40 miles to work. I have 
to take everything in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's what Richard Pryor's lost. Once in a while I'll ride the bus 
just to get the feel, the craziness. Like the fancy lady who say, 'What's that 
scent I'm wearing? Black Knight. Fifteen dollars an ounce.' Lady sittin' next 
to her, not so fancy, passes some gas. 'Pinto beans,' she say. 'Fifteen cents a 
pound.' " Harris grinned, having lured his listener into the joke. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about his patched-up marriage, he says: "A lotta women come 'round to 
show biz people because they smell success. I told my wife, 'You better get 
your act together. You were with me when I had no money. If anybody deserves 
it, you do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harris was born in Chicago. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 8. "My 
father worked for the Ford Motor Co. and was gettin' laid off a lot. I have a 
younger brother, Michael, who's totally opposite from me. He's a medical 
administrator. We're a close family. I ask my mother for advice on show 
business. She may tell me something I don't want to hear, but when people were 
sayin' 'Don't give up that day job,' she said, 'Go ahead, give it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harris attended Manual Arts High School and then went to Ottawa University in 
Kansas on a track scholarship (he's 5'9" and now weighs more than 200 pounds, 
but at one point he was svelte enough to run a 4:18 mile). He graduated, but 
the culture shock was formidable and the unquiet image of a girl friend gave 
him no peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew what I wanted to do," he recalls. "Everybody had somethin'. Good 
jobs. Somethin'. I just had nothin'. I was so in love with my girl friend. I 
was ready to get married. I didn't know how to handle it. That's why I have the 
joke, 'You took the best years of my life.' 'That's right, I wanna make sure 
you have nothin' left.' I couldn't sleep. I kept hopin' we'd get together 
again. Know what? We did. By then she had a couple of kids." Harris shrugged. 
The thrill had gone, and in retrospect all that pain and misery seemed futile, 
particularly now that he's married to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can understand who says 'Forget it.' How can you forget somebody? I 
know what people go through who go out with a thousand women and still be 
messed up. But it made me stronger for this business." 
</P>
<P>
After Harris got out of school, he scuffled around. "Everything that happens is 
a learning experience. I wanted to prove Robin Harris was about somethin'. I 
was workin' penny ante jobs. I was playin' basketball in Poinsettia Park with a 
lot of guys who were in show business. I had a feelin' I could do somethin' in 
the entertainment field. But what?" 
</P>
<P>
He realized that what he had all along was the talent to make people laugh ("I 
may've had a two-bit job in the bank, but everybody wanted to sit with me at 
lunch"). He had one good night at the Comedy Store in 1980, and then lost his 
touch (a common occurence among comedians). He grew frustrated and was ready to 
quit. Then he met the ventriloquist Richard Sanfield, of Richard &amp; Willie. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me under his wing," Harris said. " 'Hold an attitude,' he told me. 'In 
order to be a good comedian you got to read the papers, make it interesting to 
the audience. You don't have to dream up crazy bits. You gotta do somethin' the 
other comics won't do. Build a foundation. Make 'em know who Robin is. They 
like you because you talk about 'em, so talk about 'em and make 'em mind. Keep 
it down home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harris credits the blues and rhythm 'n' blues as influences, as well as 
basketball. "Comedy is like bein' intimidating on the court. I don't get 
intimidated by anybody. I was playin' in a league and was scorin' 35 points one 
night when a big guy blocked my shot. 'Oooh,' everybody said. 'He blocked your 
shot.' 'Hey, he a big man, that's what he's supposed to do,' I said. I gotta 
have that competitive edge. Black comics think they can just lay back because 
Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx have made it. But I'm out there." 
</P>
<P>
Harris wasn't partial to the standard comedy club circuit. When a good comedian 
is cooking he works on an improvisational edge, and he wasn't feeling the right 
kind of heat in white clubs. Instead, for five years he played black venues 
such as the Page 4, the Parisian Room, and Mr. Woody's on Manchester Boulevard. 
Then, about four years ago, he met a young entrepreneur named Michael Williams, 
who was talking about starting a new club. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big void in black clubs in comedy," Williams said recently. "I'd 
go to the Comedy Store and feel that I wasn't getting my money's worth. I 
sensed the need for a place that had good black entertainment. I was introduced 
to Robin. I saw he was the talent I needed to help me get started." The result 
was the Comedy Act Theatre, which has been going strong since its opening. 
</P>
<P>
"He's grown tremendously," Williams said of Harris. "He's gone from being a 
pure stand-up to an overall entertainer. He creates a relationship with the 
audience, an atmosphere everyone wants to get into. He's not a cold type of 
performer. What he does is intimate." 
</P>
<P>
Williams recalled one night when Harris' fearlessness as an insult comic was 
put to the test: Mike Tyson was in the audience. "He's taken advantage of Mike 
Tyson so many times," Williams said, chuckling. "One night he was sayin' Tyson 
can't fight. Then he said: 'I told you about Robin Givens. I used to go with 
her. She and her mother tried to move into my apartment on Central Avenue.' 
Tyson was 20. He'd just won the fight that unified the heavyweight championship 
and had drunk a lot of champagne. He got up and approached the stage. Everyone 
watched. Nobody knew what he was gonna do, including Robin. But Tyson said, 'I 
just wanna hug you.' " (Tyson and Harris are now close friends.) 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'You ain't goin' anywhere doin' that black club in Crenshaw,' " 
Harris mused, before ticking off the projects he's done and the things he has 
upcoming. All the club has done is give him a place to find himself, and to 
keep his vantage point sharpened with skepticism. He senses the metamorphosis 
that success exerts on character. About Arsenio Hall he says, "I don't like the 
way he kisses up to everybody." And of Eddie Murphy he observes, "He was 
encouraging to me, but Eddie wants all his people to entertain him all the 
time, like court jesters." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be a man," Harris said. "It's hard to be what you never were 
before. One time I got fired from a job. I had tears in my eyes. But they dried 
up. I said: 'What'd you expect? You got to make the preparation.' The more I 
study, the more my phone rings. Comedy is my office, where I'm the boss. But I 
never want to be where my friends are afraid to come up and speak to me, to say 
'You ain't God. You just in show business.' "

THE BIRTH OF TWO RESTAURANTS: THE AGONY AND THE ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurie Ochoa

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a timeless statistic: Half of all new restaurants -- about a thousand 
every year in L.A. County -- will close within a year of opening. Thirty 
percent of the survivors won't last through the second year. Considerably fewer 
become, or even aspire to become, important restaurants -- the restaurants such 
as Spago and Citrus that impress critics and have a lasting effect on the way 
we eat. Some years, only one new restaurant makes it really big. This summer, 
there might be two. 
</P>
<P>
They are Campanile and Patina, the two most anticipated restaurants of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton are the husband-and-wife team behind Campanile 
(624 S. La Brea Ave.) and the restaurant's adjoining La Brea Bakery. (He cooks, 
she bakes and does dessert.) A couple of years ago the couple left Spago for a 
highly publicized stint at Maxwell's Plum in New York. Now they're back. 
</P>
<P>
Joachim and Christine Splichal have also returned to L.A. with Patina (5955 
Melrose Ave.). He's fed the rich and famous at Westwood's exclusive Regency 
Club. Critics loved Splichal's food at Max au Triangle in Beverly Hills. And he 
was a hit in Chicago at 21 East and at New York's QV. Now he wants another shot 
at the L.A. public. 
</P>
<P>
If ever two projects seemed destined to progress smoothly, it was Patina and 
Campanile. But as Calendar discovered, no restaurant ever opens easily. We 
spent a year tracking the progress and delays -- the waits, the second 
guessing, the final frantic moments before the first customer arrives. 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to glance toward the skylight at Campanile about 9 o'clock on 
the night it opened, you would have seen the restaurant's flood-lit bell tower, 
the moon . . . and a well-dressed man on all fours directly overhead, creeping 
across the edge of the glass like Spiderman -- if you can imagine Spiderman in 
Armani. 
</P>
<P>
The man lunged for something just beyond the line of sight, then peered 
goggle-eyed down at the crowd of diners some 40 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
The alpinist, Campanile's Austrian-born manager, Manfred Krankl, hadn't gone 
berserk from opening-night jitters -- he simply hadn't figured out a better way 
to adjust the air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say a thousand times to yourself, 'Yeah, yeah, it's going to be hard,' 
" Krankl said later that night. "But then you open up and, of course, something 
unexpected goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Joachim and Christine Splichal, who opened Patina on the site of the 
old Le St. Germain three weeks ago. It was a half-hour before the restaurant's 
first customers were to arrive and things were going smoothly . . . until the 
dinner rolls, fresh from the oven, were presented to Joachim. He took one into 
his hands and kneaded it as if it were unbaked dough. He grimaced. "This is 
hard as a rock!" he barked. Worse, it was salty. And there was no time to bake 
more. The brioche were no better. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with bread!" he said after inspecting a loaf. "You 
could kill three with this thing, it's so hard." But Splichal, a chef famous 
for his perfectionism, had no choice: The bread would be served anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you're one of those places," the voice on the phone accused. "I'm sorry," 
said the woman taking the call. "We really don't have any tables left at 8 
o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
Owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton thought their restaurant would be the kind 
of place people could drop into spontaneously, but though Campanile has been in 
business just two months, those tables at 8 were booked three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck's been to Campanile. Henry Winkler ate there during the 
restaurant's first week -- he's an investor. So is Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Don Rickles came in with Bob Newhart one night. Walked right up to Mark Peel, 
reached across the counter that separates the kitchen from the dining room and 
shook Peel's hand. "Hi ya, chef!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Swayze's been in -- he sat up in the balcony so he wouldn't be noticed. 
(He was.) Harry Shearer liked his table under the skylight with a view of the 
open kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler would have come in, with Disney chief Jeffrey Katzenberg. But when 
Midler's assistant called to confirm the reservation, she was told "Bette 
Midler doesn't have a reservation; she's on the waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
"The waiting list!" Krankl said as he told the story. "Aye, aye, aye, we don't 
have a waiting list -- she really had a reservation." 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday night Patina opened three weeks ago, Campanile served a crowd of 
280. Patina booked just 29 people . . . on purpose. "If you get too busy too 
fast, you lose control," Joachim Splichal says. "Maybe the fish goes out late 
to one table, or some woman doesn't get her water on time. You'd like to think 
that the customers who come to a place during the first few weeks of a 
restaurant's life would be very forgiving. But they're not. If a guy's out 200 
bucks for dinner, he doesn't care if it's your first week or your 20th. And 
every guy who leaves unhappy is going to tell at least 10 friends about his 
lousy experience. I don't need that." 
</P>
<P>
Splichal had no control over the opening date of his restaurant. No 
restaurateur really does. At the mercy of suppliers who deliver equipment late, 
construction delays, and confusing (and often conflicting) sets of city 
regulations, one can never accurately predict an opening date. Among the most 
notable Los Angeles restaurants to open recently -- including Checkers, Katsu 
3rd and the Carnegie Deli -- none opened on time. 
</P>
<P>
Campanile was supposed to have opened sometime during the fall last year -- 
that's what the prospectus told investors early in '88. Patina, said Joachim 
Splichal in an August '88 interview, was going to open at the end of the year 
-- last year. But as the Splichals, and Peel and Silverton at Campanile found, 
delays are as much a part of opening a restaurant as hiring waiters. 
</P>
<P>
The Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
THE PERFECT LOCATION: Larry Silverton was all set to do business with the 
Catwoman. "Julie Newmar, you know, from the 'Batman' series," says Silverton, a 
construction lawyer and father of Nancy Silverton. "She owns a building down by 
City restaurant, real nice. We'd entered into negotiations and everything." The 
only problem: no parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"So two days before I had to sign the papers for the building, Doris, that's my 
wife, and I got into my car to see if we could find a lot to rent for parking," 
Silverton says. "Pretty soon we're riding down South La Brea and Doris says, 
'What's that lot?' And I looked and there was this parking lot with a car 
rental agency on it. And next to it was this very old building. And can you 
believe it? It was available -- had been on the market for a year." 
</P>
<P>
It also had been condemned, despite its arches, tile fountain and sheet-metal 
bell tower. And despite its pedigree: The Roy Selden Price-designed building 
went to Lita Grey as part of her divorce settlement with Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
The gray brick structure needed earthquake reinforcement . . . and happier 
tenants. A rent strike was on against the building's absentee owner -- the 
tenants hadn't had heat for months -- and one of the tenants, an artist, 
refused to let prospective buyers see his space. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are you?" the voice from behind the door asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My name's Larry Silverton; I want to buy this building." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to tear it down like all the other guys want to?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I want to turn it into a restaurant. It's for my son-in-law, Mark Peel, 
and my daughter, Nancy Silverton." 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" said the voice. "I know who they are -- I sell flowers to Michael's 
in Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Larry Silverton tells the story of how he got the sullen artist to 
agree to leave the building, only if Silverton bought it. Similar agreements 
were reached with the other tenants -- a woman who ran a massage parlor (where 
their La Brea Bakery is now) and a Yamaha piano class studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally when you buy a building like this, you tell the seller you want all 
the tenants out before the papers are signed," Silverton says. "But since I had 
these agreements I went ahead and took the building, sort of 'as is.' So we 
signed the deal in July of '87 and escrow closed that October. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Silverton says, "Nancy was worried. She said, 'Dad, what if we 
don't get a restaurant?' " 
</P>
<P>
MONEY MATTERS: Often, when a young chef looks for investors, there's a certain 
amount of groveling to be done. Elaborate meals are cooked in homes, free of 
charge, and personal visits are made: Chefs are grilled by people (usually 
accomplished home cooks) who like to think they know more about food than the 
professionals do. Other investors just want to see the numbers; as every 
first-time restaurateur quickly finds out, good food is only a small part of 
what makes a restaurant successful. 
</P>
<P>
For the Splichals and the Silverton-Peel team, finding investors wasn't a 
problem. Both groups' offerings were oversubscribed within a few weeks of their 
mailings, on word of mouth alone. But a restaurant doesn't begin with 
investors. ("We ended up putting about $130,000 into the project before it ever 
went to an investor," Larry Silverton says.) Until a building is attained and 
the initial permits won, the "restaurant" is like an unfinished screenplay -- 
just a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some time to get the conditional use permit (which says a building can 
become a restaurant)," Silverton says. "One neighborhood lady objected because 
she thought if we served alcohol with dinner, there would be all sorts of 
sexual activity in the parking lot. But we were lucky at the hearing. When the 
judge addressed the complaint, he said: 'Now about the sex in the parking lot. 
My experience has been that if you have too much alcohol you have less sex.' 
And then he approved it. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it was a different matter with the ABC (Alcoholic Beverage 
Control). We applied in November and didn't get our license until May, just a 
month before we opened." 
</P>
<P>
LICENSE TO SERVE: It's mid-April and Joachim Splichal, fidgety and distracted, 
sits in a chair along a wall of the nearly empty Wilshire Boulevard office of 
the Alcoholic Beverage Control while Christine patiently waits at the service 
counter for a representative to return from lunch. He pulls a booklet 
containing menus out of a brown leather satchel and flips through it as as if 
it were a travel brochure promising sunny beaches and cool tropical drinks. In 
a way, the menus do offer escape; they describe the food he and several other 
chefs will prepare at the Masters of Food &amp; Wine event in Carmel later in 
the week. Three months before he can cook a meal at his restaurant, Carmel 
seems like the perfect chance to get away from construction meetings and into a 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a clerk arrives. Christine turns her head and winks at Joachim. Papers 
are checked, occupancy limits discussed. The Splichals hoped for a simple 
transfer of Le St. Germain's existing liquor license, but the ABC has other 
ideas. Though impressed with their organization -- "Boy, am I glad I have you 
guys," the clerk says, "most people come in with a mess" -- the license cannot 
be granted without what the ABC calls a posting of the neighborhood. "Send a 
notice to every one of your neighbors within 500 feet of the restaurant," the 
clerk instructs. They'll have 30 days to call and register a complaint -- and 
remember, it's a federal offense to put the notice directly in a mailbox 
yourself. Now, if you'll just sign these. . . ." One complaint could set the 
opening of Patina back weeks, but the clerk seems optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," the clerk says, now I need you to step to your right for the 
fingerprinting." 
</P>
<P>
No one ever told Joachim Splichal that owning a restaurant meant being 
fingerprinted like some first-time offender. "I should have worn black today," 
he tells Christine. "You see how little this restaurant stuff has to do with 
food?" 
</P>
<P>
The Method 
</P>
<P>
SECOND THOUGHTS: Mark, Nancy and Manfred stand silent in the empty space that 
is to be an upstairs eating area at Campanile. From this vantage they stare out 
to the other balcony and down to the main dining room, as if searching the 
freshly painted walls for the answer to some unspoken question. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy doesn't like the color," Mark finally says. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, it's just that there's so much of it," Nancy says. "It's all the same 
pinkish-brown. I think it needs some contrast. Like the color they had up 
before." 
</P>
<P>
"The primer?" Manfred asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Nancy says. She rests her chin in her palm and resumes staring. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Campanile's dining room was to have been paneled in teak. But as 
the project dragged on and funds shriveled, the wood, once a major element of 
the restaurant's design, was eliminated. (A few small teak pieces did make it 
into the bar, and a color closely resembling a grayish-taupe primer was used to 
lighten the mood of the upstairs rooms.) 
</P>
<P>
"You might have the blueprints, but you really don't have a concept of how 
things are going to look until it's all done," said Mark Peel recently. 
</P>
<P>
The Splichals were depressed for days when they drove by the Patina site on the 
way back from a weekend trip and saw that their long-awaited steel trellises 
had finally been erected. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a prison," Christine said again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait until you see it finished," interior architect Cheryl Brantner told 
them the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll believe it when I see it," Joachim said. 
</P>
<P>
CHALK TALK: "OK. Does anyone know what DOC means?" 
</P>
<P>
"Does it mean . . . God?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nooo," says Campanile's Krankl. He shoots a glance at maitre d' Thomas Gavlan 
and shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
It's late June, two days before Campanile's first dinner, and most of the 
restaurant's waiters, waitresses and bus staff sit gathered at one end of the 
restaurant's nearly finished main dining room. Each has been given a wine 
glass, which some place at their feet and others clench in a fist. One waiter 
keeps a thick organizer under his chair with a file stuck inside marked 
"Campanile," while head shots and a script protrude from another's bag. A few 
balance note pads in their laps. In a week, customers will be asking wine 
advice, so it's important that the wait staff has some knowledge of what's on 
the list . . . and that DOC is the designation Italian wine makers use to show 
that a product comes from government-approved grapes and regions. After letting 
them taste an Italian Erbaluce di Caluso and providing some background, Krankl 
asks for comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has almost a mossy quality, like a musty well?" says one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, musty's not very appealing." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it like a Meursault?" another offers. 
</P>
<P>
"Nooo, not really." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if not Meursault, then a Montrachet?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to use overly fancy terms," Krankl says. "They tend to get on my 
nerves. I want you to come up with descriptions that the customers are going to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Then Nancy Silverton appears with an armload of desserts and everyone in the 
room perks up. "Oh, look, guys, goodies," Gavlan says. 
</P>
<P>
This is the good part, like getting to watch a movie in class instead of taking 
a test. 
</P>
<P>
"All right. Now this is a kumquat semifreddo," she says, and then cuts into the 
frozen cheesecake-size disc. "It's not as cold as it's supposed to be, but this 
will give you an idea of what we're doing here." 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me, Nancy?" one waiter says. "How do you spell kumquat?" 
</P>
<P>
Plates and forks are passed around and the staff steps up to the table to 
gather samples. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get away from making cakes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
There's an unsweetened chocolate mousse ("A child would not enjoy this," Nancy 
warns), a brioche tart with raspberry sabayon, rice flan, a baked lemon tart 
with lemon curd on the side. ("This is a little different than some tarts you 
may have seen," she says. "So often lemon curd is all you get.") 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem," Nancy says, "is that Mark is afraid the desserts are too 
pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Mouths full, the staff can only shake their heads in disagreement and keep 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CHECK: No one notices the tan, handsome stranger in Reeboks when he 
walks into the bar. 
</P>
<P>
It's Friday, the first party is tonight, and the health inspector is due any 
minute. Tony Singaus, who helped the Splichals get the kitchen in order, is 
giving Christine some last-minute advice. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the room, Cheryl Brantner discusses the restaurant's 
exterior landscaping with her assistant. "We don't want it to look too sweet," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the stranger speaks up. "Hi, I'm the health inspector." 
</P>
<P>
Christine's and Tony's eyes go big. 
</P>
<P>
Aren't inspectors more official-looking? More intimidating? In his jeans and 
beach shirt, his longish hair and bushy mustache, this guy looks as if he'd 
rather buy you a beer in a bar than shut your bar down. 
</P>
<P>
"So what's the deal with the door?" the inspector begins. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?" Christine asks. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I don't ever want to see it open." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we aren't going to open it -- it's actually a window to us." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you better bolt it shut just in case," he says. "We've been having a lot 
of vermin trouble with this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
It's clear that Reeboks or not, this stranger means business. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, what about the space between these panels here?" He peers at the oak wood 
paneling behind the bar. "I want to see some clear silicone between these." 
</P>
<P>
"But that'll ruin the look," Tony says. "It's part of the design." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's vermin harborage to me," the inspector says. 
</P>
<P>
Tony and Christine follow the inspector through the restaurant, into the 
bathrooms and then the kitchen. He glances at a stainless steel cold box 
inherited from the old Le St. Germain. "Is this a self-contained unit?" he 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
Tony nods. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful!" he says. Less chance of vermin invasion. 
</P>
<P>
As they walk back into the bar, the inspection seems just about over. Then he 
sees a door ajar near the private dining room. 
</P>
<P>
"What's behind there?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Christine's smile grows tight. Everyone had been told to keep that door shut. 
"It's the storage room," she says. "Do you need to see it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I need to see it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The first place the inspector's eyes go is to the ice machine, which has just 
been hooked up. Then he looks at the molding where the floor and wall meet. 
"Vinyl," he says. "I hate vinyl. If you're going to have the ice machine in 
here, you're going to have to replace that." 
</P>
<P>
"But we've really cleaned it up from the way it was," Christine says. "You know 
it's a very old building, and we've done a lot that we haven't had to do, and 
we added the handicap bathrooms. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I didn't force you to buy this restaurant," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Starting to Cook 
</P>
<P>
BIRD TROUBLE: The chicken was dry. And too big. It was supposed to be crisp and 
moist and flat. (It's cooked under a brick, the way they do it in Tuscany.) It 
was supposed to be one of the best dishes in Peel's repertoire. People who had 
eaten the chicken at parties and small family meals had called it the best 
chicken dish they had ever eaten. Godhead chicken. But on the night of the 
first preview dinner with friends and investors (the idea is to try out your 
new food and new waiters on sympathetic appetites before paying customers 
arrive), they said it . . . "could be better." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to slightly pre-cook the chicken, which is a compromise," Peel said. 
"Otherwise, people would have to wait an hour to get their food." 
</P>
<P>
And so, on the day of Campanile's opening night, as everyone else worried about 
seating plans and silverware and how to place customer orders on the new 
computer system, Peel worried about chicken. 
</P>
<P>
He tried smaller birds. And to get the chicken to lie flatter on the plate, he 
removed several bones -- not too many, though, because bones are part of what 
gives chicken a lot of its flavor. A flock of fowl later, Peel got what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
SHIRTS FROM CLEVELAND: "OK," Joachim says. "Everyone in the kitchen. I want 
full power. Let's move." 
</P>
<P>
It's seven days before Patina officially opens, but just seven hours before the 
restaurant's first critic arrives. John Mariani is in town to research his 
annual "Best Restaurants in America" piece for Esquire, and Joachim Splichal 
hopes to feed him in time to qualify for a place in the article -- sort of like 
an Oscar-hungry producer who sneaks a movie into theaters a week before the 
year ends. Two private parties also have been scheduled; they were booked back 
when the restaurant was supposed to be finished by July 21. 
</P>
<P>
Current status of the restaurant: no windows in the doors, no mirrors in the 
restrooms, an unfinished bar, waiters' pants still to arrive from the tailor, 
and until five minutes ago, no chefs in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Brantner walks around with several packages of Hugo Boss shirts; she flew all 
the way to the manufacturer's Cleveland warehouse so the waiters would have 
something to wear in time. Several landscape workers adjust the plants in the 
restaurant's front trellises. A pair of window installers carefully (and 
slowly) measure and adjust a frosted-glass pane. Sydney, the upholsterer, is 
busy fitting the banquettes. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon," Joachim says to the window installers. "Let's move. Boom, boom, boom." 
</P>
<P>
"Boom, boom, boom," the installers mimic back in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"And what about you?" Christine asks. "Are we going to finally see a menu from 
you?" For three weeks, Christine has pestered Joachim about his menu; she's 
anxious to get it plugged into the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
"The food, I'm not worried about," Joachim says. "I once cooked in the Sahara 
for 60 -- so don't worry, the food will be good." 
</P>
<P>
ROLLING IN DOUGH: "They must be making a ton of money here," says an 
expensively dressed man to his date in her thigh-high Spandex-enriched dress as 
they wait for a table along with a roomful of hungry people. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Campanile has so far exceeded every projection it set for itself, both 
in dinner seatings and in bread sales at its La Brea Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
But the bakery and the restaurant have become almost too successful. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of lunch has been delayed, partly because management is trying 
to work out kinks in service and in the kitchen, and partly because the 
restaurant's bakery can't make enough bread for its own sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Silverton's bread has become so popular -- 25 restaurants order the bread 
wholesale -- that she's had to turn away new orders for the past two months. 
"We ran out of space," Silverton says. "There's just no room for any more 
bread." 
</P>
<P>
Expansion is already under way. But that costs money. And so does running a 
restaurant. The operation uses up $45,000 in payroll alone every two weeks and 
operating costs run way higher. Even if all goes as expected, it will take 
three years before investors make back what they initially put into the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
As for Peel and Silverton, they are far from wealthy. During much of the 
construction phase, they gave up their Fairfax-district apartment and moved in 
with Silverton's sister in the Valley to save money on rent. And until 
recently, the woman who watched the couple's two children made more money than 
Peel and Silverton combined. 
</P>
<P>
OPENING NIGHT: "I still haven't done any cooking," Joachim says. It's 5:05. Two 
more hours to go before the restaurant's first guests arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, oh, I forgot about music!" Christine says. "We only have one CD." 
</P>
<P>
In the entryway, contractor Tim LeFevre finds himself sweeping -- he did not 
anticipate this when he first took the job. "This close to the wire," he says, 
"you pitch in any way you can." 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, things are bustling. One chef stands slapping thin rounds of 
raw potato over shavings of black truffle as if he were dealing cards. "Don't 
waste any of that truffle," Splichal tells him. "That thing is like a diamond; 
it cost 120 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Another chef hands Joachim two haricots verts to sample; he gives his thumbs-up 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Christine walks in just as a couple of cabbage heads go flying in the air and 
asks, "Can we let two more people come for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
"No one else," Joachim says, "not even the Pope." Then he picks up a hunk of 
foie gras and begins slicing. "Hey, is someone checking the bathrooms?" he 
asks. "Do we have toilet paper?" 
</P>
<P>
Chef de cuisine Traci de Jardin tests a fingerful of lobster sauce and smiles 
wide. "Yeah, killer!" she says. "This sauce is great!" 
</P>
<P>
At 6:15 ("Fifty minutes to go," Joachim shouts), Patina is in chaos. "Where's 
the tailor?" Joachim asks. "Are my waiters going to work in underpants?" 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later the tailor arrives, just behind Tom Andre, who's brought the 
menu covers fresh from the printer. At 6:25 the mirrors for the bathrooms get 
delivered and the carpenter hustles to get them into place. The only major item 
missing is the glass for the front door. "I think it's sexy," Joachim jokes. 
But when the window installers are still measuring at 6:40 (20 minutes to go), 
Joachim begins muttering, "Never again, never again." 
</P>
<P>
HOT RESTAURANT: It's a little after 6 p.m. and Campanile's first customers of 
the evening have started to arrive. Mark Peel picks up a blowtorch. "Time to 
start a fire," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Roasted lamb shoulders fill a huge shallow pan; a heavy layer of thick rosemary 
branches, dried to a gray brittleness in the oven, blankets the meat. It looks 
like the floor of a forest in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Peel ignites the torch and blasts the lamb. Within seconds, the lamb is aflame. 
The rosemary crackles excitedly and then withers, turning first a hot ember-red 
and then a deathly white-gray. Wherever the flames recede, Peel retorches, 
setting off new flurries of heat and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried matches," he says, "but a blowtorch gives you more control." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as the mass of rosemary turns mostly black, Peel aims the blowtorch at 
one last branch and sets the fiery spear of herb in the middle of the pan. Then 
he turns off the torch and waits for the smoke to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Peel's lamb, which he jokes was called "the dish of the '90s" by a magazine 
nearly a year before Campanile opened, has become the most popular entree on 
the menu. "It outsells the chicken, and it outsells the salmon -- by 50%," Peel 
says. "We do twice as much as I thought we would. 
</P>
<P>
"But they didn't like the skate," he says. Some customers complained that it 
was too fishy and sent the dish back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an unusual fish," Peel says, "People didn't know what they were 
getting." It was 86'd from the menu just a few days after the restaurant's 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
Backups in the kitchen are what really irk Peel, however. Too often in the 
beginning, customers would wait an hour or more for their food, not because of 
bad service but because the kitchen couldn't get the food out. It's the curse 
of almost every new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Another part of the problem: Peel tried to do too much of the work. Like a 
stereotypical dad overly protective of his barbecue, Peel is the czar of the 
grill in a restaurant with a menu full of dishes in need of grilling. 
"Sometimes I would be working like a crazy person, completely in the weeds, 
while three people had nothing to do," Peel says. 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments have been made, but Peel doesn't anticipate ever having a 
completely smooth-running kitchen. "You always want to play it close to the 
edge," he says. "If it's too easy, you get sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
FINAL WORDS: With just 20 minutes to go, Joachim Splichal addresses his 
waiters: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever want to hear a no; that word doesn't exist here. Always seat the 
man under the track lighting -- women don't like the exposure and men love the 
spotlight. Never put the coffee on until the first course is out of the 
kitchen. Don't spill sauce on anybody, and don't overpour. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone asks you a question and you don't know the answer, don't tell them 
some kind of bull. Finally, be gracious, be nice, be humble and good luck." 
</P>

NIGHT HEAT: THE TALK-SHOW COMPETITION SIZZLES; 
</P>
<P>
AN EXPANSION OF AD REVENUES PROMISES TO ADD EVEN MORE PROGRAMS TO THE 
LATE-NIGHT TV AIRWAVES 
</P>

<P>
It's late. The streets are quiet. Doors are locked, teeth are brushed, the cat 
has been put outside for the night. Sleep beckons. 
</P>
<P>
But in millions of homes across the country, Americans are shunning sleep, 
shunning books and magazines, perhaps even shunning their sleeping partners. 
People in more than 25.5 million homes, the vast majority drawn from that 
upscale, young-adult, consuming-crazed demographic that advertisers prize, are 
spending the midnight hour basking in a blue, iridescent video glow. And the 
networks, programmers, syndicators and advertisers are waking up to this fact 
in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
As Arsenio Hall, one of the top guns in this war against sleep, might describe 
the blossoming late-night scene if it was a guest on his own show: "Johnny 
Carson is here tonight. Pat Sajak is here. Ted Koppel is here. David Letterman 
is here. Bob Costas is here. Arsenio Hall is here." Hall's energetic, 
MTV-generation, in-studio audience would then bark, "Rooof, rooof, rooof," and 
collectively crank their fists in the air as Hall chanted his monologue-ending 
trademark, now as familiar to some late-night addicts as Carson's golf swing: 
"So, let's . . . get . . . busy!" 
</P>
<P>
The late-night television galaxy is busy. Two new stars have joined the fray so 
far this year and, with advertising dollars pouring in, it's about to get even 
busier. ABC plans to launch its own midnight talk show by next summer, and next 
month, "After Hours," a late-night syndicated magazine program from the former 
producers of "Eye on L.A.," specifically designed as an alternative to the 
nightly talk shows, will premiere locally on KTTV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the A.C. Nielsen Co. show that the number of people watching 
television between 11:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. has remained relatively constant 
over the past two years -- at about 25.5 million homes each night. But with 
Sajak and Hall joining Carson, Letterman and Koppel in the battle for viewers 
and advertisers, most of that audience -- more than 18.5 million households a 
night -- is now watching the unending parade of celebrities and news makers who 
troop across the talk show sets. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers are happy because these programs are luring the young, 
free-spending viewers they want their commercials to reach. The networks and 
syndicators are happy because the advertisers are paying more for shows that 
are relatively inexpensive to produce. And once and future talk show hosts are 
happy because soaring ad revenues generate more talk shows (see accompanying 
story). 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, there was Johnny and only Johnny. For nearly 27 years, 
Carson's "Tonight Show" has been king of late night. Would-be challengers, 
including Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, Dick Cavett and Alan Thicke, have come and 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, ABC discovered that 
serious-minded viewers would stay up until midnight for some in-depth analysis 
of the day's top news event, and "Nightline" was born. 
</P>
<P>
Exploiting "The Tonight Show's" stranglehold on the late-night audience, NBC 
launched "Late Night With David Letterman" in 1982 and discovered that there 
was an audience that would stay up until 1:30 a.m. to watch wacky stunts, gags 
and insult-ridden celebrity interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Fox tried to break into the world of late night with three different shows, 
including one starring Joan Rivers. All three burned out like a wet match. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a way to solidify its late-night supremacy, NBC then debuted "Later 
With Bob Costas" (weeknights at 1:30 a.m.) last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Late night was a dormant area prior to two years ago," said Michael Brockman, 
president of daytime, children's and late-night entertainment at ABC. "It was 
taken for granted that NBC had a lock on the majority of the audience. ABC had 
been successful with 'Nightline' but that played to a whole different 
sensibility. CBS was floundering and decided that it had to do something to tap 
into the enormous potential that late night has." 
</P>
<P>
Brockman, who held a similar post at CBS before moving to ABC earlier this 
year, developed and launched "The Pat Sajak Show" on CBS last January. At the 
same time, Paramount retooled the one glowing element from Fox's late-night 
wreckage (Arsenio Hall had had modest success as the short term successor to 
Joan Rivers on Fox) and debuted "The Arsenio Hall Show" in syndication all over 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Carson, Letterman and Koppel have slipped a fraction from a year 
ago. Sajak is sputtering but surviving. And Hall has become a media superstar 
and perhaps the biggest reason why there is a new buzz of late night 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is difficult to compare ratings for these programs because none of 
them actually go head to head in the same time period all over the country, 
over the last seven months "The Tonight Show" has averaged a 5.5 rating, 
"Night-line" a 4.8 and "Letterman," "Sajak" and "Arsenio" have all registered a 
3.2 (each rating point represents 904,000 homes). But "Arsenio" has been 
building momentum, beating both Sajak and Letterman with an average nationwide 
rating of about 4 in recent months, and occasionally, in some markets on some 
nights, beating Carson head to head. 
</P>
<P>
But while there is some spirited competition to be the first to book certain 
guests, the shows claim not to be at war with one another. "Nobody is fighting 
anybody," says Robert Morton, producer of "Late Night With David Letterman." 
"There have always been several other shows on against us and I think they just 
bring more people to late night. It helps everybody out. There is no reason why 
you can't have two or three shoe stores on 5th Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Arsenio's Audience: Young, Ethnic and Hip 
</P>
<P>
"In syndication, you have to identify a specific viewer need and then go after 
that audience," said Steve Goldman, executive vice president of Paramount 
domestic television. "It's like marketing soap. You decide if there is a need 
for a specific product and then you try to fill that need. That's what we did 
with 'Arsenio.' We identified a specific audience that wasn't being served by 
the other late-night shows and went after it." 
</P>
<P>
Young, urban, ethnic and hip -- and apparently waiting for a decidedly def talk 
show host -- that audience is buying Paramount's latest box of syndicated 
"soap." 
</P>
<P>
"Arsenio" is the show where viewers learn the latest lingo from the world of 
rap music. It is the show where Sally Kirkland and Ana Alicia ogle and then 
jump into the lap of their debonair host. It is the show on which the host can 
get away with asking Brooke Shields if she is still a virgin and author Jackie 
Collins can get away with grilling the host about his own sexual history. It is 
the show where black celebrities such as Tone Loc, Kool Moe Dee and Dave 
Winfield can talk with their host as if they were two black men sharing 
confidences in the privacy of their own back yards. 
</P>
<P>
The show has caught on so fast that Paramount has already added a sixth night 
each week, a repeat, for stations to broadcast on the weekends. And in several 
markets, stations have upgraded the show to earlier time periods where it has 
pulled even bigger numbers. In New York, for example, WWOR recently moved the 
show from 12:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and it has beaten Carson several times. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Hall, whose show airs locally on KCOP Channel 13 at 11 p.m., thriving in 
a marketplace in which so many other would-be-Johnnys have failed? 
</P>
<P>
"Arsenio is the show," said Marla Kell Brown, the program's producer. "He is 
such a different talent that there was room for him in the late-night 
marketplace. His comedy is so different. It is more physical and has more of an 
edge to it. There wasn't much on television for the young audience, especially 
in late night. 
</P>
<P>
"Letterman has a young audience but not as young as ours. The only shows with 
this kind of youth appeal were on Friday or Saturday nights or MTV. Arsenio 
says that it's the kids of Johnny's viewers who are tuning in. In one room the 
parents are watching Carson and in another the kids are watching us. We're not 
really competing with Carson. It's just another audience." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the audience that goes to movies and buys (records, clothes and 
sneakers,)" Goldman said, "and our success in reaching that audience has 
finally been perceived by the advertising community. At first the advertisers 
were skeptical. They didn't believe we could do as well as Letterman and we had 
to scrounge around for sponsors. Now they are calling us. We are virtually sold 
out for next season, and I think it's clear that we have brought some 
advertisers into late night who weren't here before." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said that in this blockbuster summer movie season, the studios have 
been spending as much advertising money on "Arsenio" as on "The Tonight Show," 
even though Carson attracts at least 50% more viewers.

A Tradition-Minded Sajak Is Struggling 
</P>
<P>
The story of Pat Sajak's talk show is not so jolly, and certainly not so 
lucrative. Many television executives say that CBS was making more money with 
the hourlong action dramas it aired in the time slot before Sajak, the "Wheel 
of Fortune" nice guy, debuted in late night last January. Ratings for Sajak are 
significantly less than what the CBS dramas pulled a year ago in such markets 
as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sajak, for example, registered only a 2.3 
rating and a 10% share of the L.A. audience in last May's sweeps. The previous 
May, CBS' late-night dramas scored a 3.6 and a 15 share locally for the same 
time period. 
</P>
<P>
Even the optimistic Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, conceded 
that revenues for that time period are about the same. But he quickly added 
that, with Sajak, the network is in a potentially more profitable situation 
because the talk show is less expensive to produce than the action shows. 
</P>
<P>
"And it is a better situation all around for CBS because Sajak creates an 
identification for the network," LeMasters said. "NBC has had an advantage for 
a long time with Carson and Letterman, and ABC with Ted Koppel. Sajak can build 
that sort of identification for us." The question is: How long can CBS endure 
mediocre to bad ratings in late night while everyone around them prospers? 
</P>
<P>
"Sajak," the network's first foray into late-night talk since Merv Griffin 
tried a show in 1969, opened to good ratings as the curious and his many fans 
from "Wheel of Fortune" tuned in to see what the show was all about. But after 
a couple of weeks of Carson-like numbers, the audience has been slipping -- 
down to a recent plateau of a 3 rating each night. One week last month, the 
show slipped to a 2.8. Carson gets close to twice Sajak's audience; Hall and 
Letterman also outdraw him and have a far more desirable demographic makeup to 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS affiliates who carry the show are antsy. About half delay the program 
half an hour, rather than airing it at 11:30 p.m. when late-night audience 
levels are at their highest. And in some major markets, including Detroit, 
Cleveland and Atlanta (three of "Arsenio's" strongholds), the CBS stations have 
decided not to air "The Pat Sajak Show" at all. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, recently warned that 
Sajak could be pulled from the schedule by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
When talking with a reporter about the condition of his program, Sajak 
maintains the same "aw shucks" attitude he presents on screen. "Our goal was to 
put on the best show we could, find our core audience and build from there. I 
think we have done that," Sajak said. "For us to be a long success, we do have 
to demonstrate growth. The leveling out of our audience has happened and I 
don't know if it is at a level that CBS or the affiliates will stick with. But 
we're not going to make any radical changes. It's not like we touched a hot 
stove and we're backing off. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to put on the kind of talk show that I grew up watching, Jack Paar 
and Carson, fairly traditional. And anyway, there are only so many cosmetic 
things you can do: Do I have a couch or a few chairs? Do I sit behind a desk or 
not? (Carson, Letterman and Sajak do, Hall doesn't.) Most talk of doing 
something different deteriorates into a discussion of furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But Sajak's contention that you can't reinvent the talk show is why many 
industry observers believe his show is struggling. His program is just too much 
like Carson's. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a durable format for the show that would last, one with no tricks," 
CBS' LeMasters said. "We weren't going to start with barking elephants up 
front. But maybe we were going head-to-head too much with Carson and allowing 
the audience to graze through us to him. We cannot force Pat to go toe-to-toe 
with Carson in the monologue. It's an unfair burden we put on him. If he is 
forced to compete directly against Arsenio and Johnny, it requires a certain 
joke level and timing that probably is not his strength. Pat is warm, 
intelligent, a good interviewer, but his personality goes against those 
rim-shot jokes." 
</P>
<P>
So changes are in the works. Sajak has already scrapped his opening monologue, 
and after a brief "hello," he goes straight to his desk and brings out the 
guests. The show has also begun using taped pieces -- something Letterman has 
done with great success -- such as Sajak giving a wacky tour of the CBS studio 
to two silly tourists. And, LeMasters said, they are going to try a number of 
"theme" shows, such as taking the entire program to Washington, D.C., for two 
weeks in December, in an effort to force some attention Sajak's way. 
</P>
<P>
LeMasters insisted that despite Stringer's warnings and affiliate skittishness, 
Sajak is not going to get the same sort of quick hook that struggling 
prime-time shows inevitably receive. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we stay around a 3 (rating), we're OK," LeMasters said. "If we 
slipped down into the low 2s, then we would have to make radical adjustments in 
format. We're all neophytes when it comes to late night. And we are going to 
take our time and make sure that any changes we make have a long-term benefit 
for the show and the network." 
</P>
<P>
Carson and Letterman Leave NBC Smiling 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NBC, the long-reigning champion of late night, watches, worries a 
little, checks out its revenues and then, like Mike Tyson, proudly proclaims, 
"Bring 'em on, we'll beat all-comers." NBC pulled in more than $200 million in 
ad revenues for Letterman's and Carson's two hours of late-night talk in 1988, 
according to Arbitron's broadcast advertisers report, and even with the 
increased competition, NBC expects to do better this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our programs have held up," said Bob Niles, a research and marketing executive 
at NBC. "Arsenio's success doesn't cannibalize from us. His audience doesn't 
come out of our turf. In fact, I think Arsenio and Letterman actually help each 
other. They have a similar appeal and the fact that his show is on earlier in 
many markets (including Los Angeles and New York), might encourage viewers who 
would not have had the incentive to stay up until 12:30 a.m. to watch Arsenio 
and then stay up and watch Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
Niles said that Letterman's audience had slipped a bit last year, before 
"Arsenio" and "Sajak" hit the air. But the new competition has done nothing to 
accelerate that slippage, and this summer, Niles said, Letterman's audience has 
grown back to what it had been the past several years. And that young, yuppie 
audience is so prized by advertisers that even though Letterman garners just 
over half the total audience Carson does, individual spots on the show sell for 
only about 25% less. 
</P>
<P>
"We are basically doing what we've been doing for the last 7 1/2 years and 
paying little attention to the other shows," said Robert Morton, producer of 
"Letterman." He insists that while "Sajak" and "Arsenio" are talk shows, 
Letterman's is a comedy program that often features scripted comedy sketches. 
Letterman's is not the show where guests are pampered and their latest project 
is hawked. Letterman's TV living room is the place where Nastassia Kinski's 
funky hairdo is mercilessly ridiculed and where Shirley MacLaine and Cher are 
provoked into cussing out their admittedly obnoxious host. 
</P>
<P>
No one from "The Tonight Show" would agree to discuss the current state of the 
show or the competition. Fred de Cordova, the program's executive producer for 
nearly 20 years, merely typed out this statement: " 'The Tonight Show' 
continues to put on what we hope will continue to be the most interesting 
guests available; the major stars of motion pictures, television and the 
musical world. There have been no changes in this method in all the years I 
have been with the show and I see no reason why any change should be made in 
the future, because, after all, the prime asset of 'The Tonight Show' sits 
behind the host's desk and continues to happily keep a firm hold on the 
public's interest and its sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among those involved in late-night television is that no matter 
how hot Arsenio Hall gets, no matter how many stories are written about Hall, 
Sajak, Letterman or any new challenger, Johnny Carson will be king for as long 
as he continues to host his show. This October, Carson will celebrate 27 years 
behind "The Tonight Show" desk. There is nothing to suggest that he plans to 
give it up any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing Late Night Through a Crystal Ball 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of late-night talk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jay Leno, who hosts "The Tonight Show" one night a week, is ready to take over 
on the day Carson decides to retire. More immediately, ABC will roll out its 
own talk show, to follow "Nightline," sometime next year. ABC's Brockman said 
it will be a "personality-driven" program (read: it will have a host just like 
all the others) that will attempt to woo the prized young-adult audience. 
</P>
<P>
ABC had tested a late-night show called "Days End" for two months earlier this 
year on several of its stations, including KABC Channel 7 in Los Angeles. The 
show was designed as a companion to "Nightline" with both serious and 
lighthearted commentary and interviews about the day's current events. It 
flopped, and Brockman dumped the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"The young-adult audience is the most available and most salable at that time 
of night," Brockman said, "and the way to win them over is with a compelling, 
stimulating program that is driven by a compelling and exciting personality. 
The profile of the ABC network shows a healthy mix of that young-adult 
audience, so if we can find the right kind of personality for them, we will 
have the air time (in prime time) to promote the personality and a good chance 
of getting that audience to carry over into late night." 
</P>
<P>
He said that ABC will test several ideas over the next several months before 
finally settling on a host and a specific format around the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly have to come up with something that differentiates us from 
all the competition," Brockman said. "It will be a tough battle. ABC has tried 
valiantly and struggled in this time period for years. But I believe there is 
still a large, untapped audience out there that will enable several more shows 
to thrive." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how many shows can survive in the current late-night environment. 
Just a year ago, many would have said there was room for only Carson and 
Letterman. Now programmers and advertisers are singing a different tune. Just 
two weeks ago, Fox began distributing its late-night Saturday stand-up comedy 
show, "Comic Strip Live," to all of its affiliates nationwide. Dennis Wholey 
has his own "intimate" call-in talk show, "LateNight America," on 147 public 
television stations, including KCET Channel 28, Saturdays at midnight. Byron 
Allen, formerly the co-host of "Real People," will debut his own Saturday-night 
talk show in syndication next month. And KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman will get 
his own show next month too. Even with the odds stacked against them, everyone, 
it seems, wants in on the act. And why not? It's a great gig if you can get it. 
Just ask the beleaguered Pat Sajak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only television, and there is no firing squad standing by in case you 
fail," Sajak deadpanned. "And it sure beats loading trucks for a living. I get 
to come out and sit behind a desk and people I respect and admire come out and 
call me Pat. It's pretty neat. I recommend that everyone get their own talk 
show. And if things continue as they're going, soon everyone will."

LATE NIGHT'S GROWING AD CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the three major networks' prime-time audience levels eroding steadily for 
the past decade, television's late-night arena -- with its much lower costs per 
commercial and its young, movie-going and soft-drink-and-beer-swilling audience 
-- has become an increasingly tempting alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Late night is very attractive because you can reach the young viewer," said 
John Sisk, senior vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency 
in New York. "And we believe that at that time of night, the audience's 
receptivity to commercials is better. They have stayed up late and this is 
really what they want to watch and so they are attentive and responsive to what 
they see." 
</P>
<P>
The total amount of national advertising dollars spent in late night soared 
nearly 25% in 1988 over the previous year to more than $1.2 billion, despite 
little change in the quantity or quality of the programming available, 
according to the Television Bureau of Advertising. The bureau has yet to 
compile figures for the first seven months of 1989, but with the significant 
programming changes late night has seen this year, programmers and advertising 
executives said they expect the total to rise again. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased competition in late night is definitely bringing new viewers to 
(that time period)," said Bob Niles, a research and marketing executive at NBC. 
"And if you look at the advertisers that are buying into late night -- 10 years 
ago (when Carson was the only game in town) it was primarily the packaged goods 
companies; now you have import automobiles, movie studios, the soft-drink 
companies. There is clearly a change in the kind of advertisers and the amount 
of money being spent. Advertisers looking for an upscale audience are flocking 
to late-night (talk shows). 
</P>
<P>
"And the syndicators and network programmers see that happening -- they see the 
increase in the audience and the flood of advertising dollars and it makes 
sense to try to get in the game. With (Carson and Letterman's) success in 
drawing the upscale demographic, we've created our own monster that naturally 
breeds more competition." STEVE WEINSTEIN

GALLERY OWNER/AUCTIONEER BUILDS REPUTATION BY SHOWCASING LATINO ART FEATURING 
STRONG POLITICAL CONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHMALTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within the Los Angeles art community, Robert Berman may be best known as a 
gallery owner who specializes in Hispanic artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is also the first gallery owner to showcase hit-and-run guerrilla artist 
Robbie Conal. 
</P>
<P>
Some people in the art community first heard Berman's name when he brought the 
popular Keith Haring/Andy Warhol show, "Andy Mouse," to Santa Monica from New 
York three years ago, and they are anticipating Berman's upcoming fall show 
(Oct. 19-Nov. 15) with Haring, who this time collaborates with Beat-generation 
icon William Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Berman's career, including 10 years dealing in and displaying contemporary art 
in Los Angeles, could also be characterized by a series of incidents 
surrounding a single billboard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was part of the cultural landscape of L. A. for five months," said Berman, 
41, referring to a billboard designed by artist Daniel Martinez, which went up 
in November. "It was scheduled to be whitewashed." 
</P>
<P>
You may have seen it. Ferocious, barking dogs pictured with a brief caption, 
"Don't Bite the Hand That Feeds You." At 28 by 40 feet, it was hard to miss, 
especially because it was placed across the street from the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
To save the piece, Berman spent thousands of dollars to buy it from Patrick 
Media, the billboard company that originally commissioned the project. But what 
does the owner of a 375-square-foot art gallery do with a 28- by 40-foot 
billboard? 
</P>
<P>
"Either it travels, or I have a lot of firewood," Berman recalled saying to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Berman convinced a curator planning a European show featuring L. A. 
Hispanic art that the billboard would be an invaluable addition. He agreed, and 
though Berman had to incur the initial shipping costs (about $5,000), the 
potential washout is one of the hits of the show, called "Demon Angels," 
traveling through Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"He reached into his own pocket and saved the artwork," Martinez said. "Now 
it's going to travel to museums all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know what I'll do if it ever comes back," Berman said. Perhaps, 
he jokes, he'll have to auction it off piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
A veteran art auctioneer, Berman not only holds auctions for his own gallery 
but is sought by charities and art organizations to perform the money-raising 
events for them. He has helped put together auctions for the Graphic Arts 
Council (a support group at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), acted as 
auctioneer for an organization that aids Central American refugees and ran a 
benefit auction for Amnesty International on July 14, which he held at a space 
he is temporarily occupying down the street from his smaller B-1 Gallery, 
called B-1 Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his appetite for Latino art with strong political content, his 
relationship with Robbie Conal and his choice of charities, Berman is aware 
that some people might suspect that he is more interested in polemics than 
paintings. Not so, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of myself as an art dealer. I really don't involve my political 
concerns with my business, though it appears that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I love political art and the idea of art having different levels of 
involvement. It has immediate impact on people. You're hit in the face with it 
whether you like it or not. People might say I only show liberal art, but 
that's because the only good political art I find is liberal." 
</P>
<P>
Berman's reputation for showcasing strident political art was enhanced when he 
became the first gallery owner to offer Conal a show. Conal is famous for his 
irreverent black and white portraits of public figures plastered on buildings, 
walls and fences around Los Angeles and other metropolitan areas; his "Men With 
No Lips" poster caught Berman's eye during a visit to New York. When Berman 
found out that the controversial artist was a Santa Monica resident, the 
Westside art dealer sought him out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the liveliest dealers in Los Angeles," Conal said. "And he's very 
honest, which is rare among gallery slime." 
</P>
<P>
Although Conal believes that "the whole world is my gallery," he credits Berman 
with helping him become legitimized within the art community by showcasing his 
oil paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Berman says the Conal show, which opened in April, 1987, produced some tense 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to get a few threatening phone 
</P>
<P>
calls back then," Berman said. "But Robbie was the one really taking chances, 
and he was doing all the work." 
</P>
<P>
Conal said: "He was the first person to stick his neck out, but he has a 
history of digging up local art that the mainstream art establishment won't 
touch." 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles artist George Yepes is one of those who felt neglected by the 
local art scene until Berman showcased his paintings. Yepes, 33, began his 
career as a muralist but is best known for the cover illustration he did for 
rock group Los Lobos' recent album, "La Pistola y el Corazon." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a long, documented exclusion as an artist. I wasn't getting good 
representation," Yepes said. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed when Berman squeezed him into his busy gallery schedule for 
one week in January. That week turned into a successful three-week run where 
Berman sold eight original Yepes paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody selling my work like him," Yepes said. 
</P>
<P>
But just as important to the artist is Berman's willingness to exhibit his 
paintings that aren't for sale, specifically two pieces -- with graphic 
anti-war themes -- banned by an ad agency that was organizing a show of 
Hispanic art. 
</P>
<P>
"This ad agency said they couldn't expose their clients to this type of art," 
Yepes said. "Everybody uses Hispanic as a label for everything from Taco Bell 
to Palomo Picasso," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I'm proven otherwise, his is the only gallery persistently and actively 
promoting and displaying true Hispanic and Chicano art." 
</P>
<P>
Berman acknowledges his role in helping local Latino artists find a forum, but 
says he doesn't want to get pigeonholed as a promoter exclusively of Chicano 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't deal with Hispanic art or Chicano art. I deal in good art," he said. 
"But I like the sensitivity of the artists of Latin origin, mainly because I 
see the fire and the anger of it. It's not your American mainstream, elitist, 
white-collar art." 
</P>
<P>
The work of German-born Zara Kriegstein fits Berman's preference for 
figurative, colorful art that makes a statement, although she is neither Latino 
nor a Los Angeles resident. But Kriegstein's passionate, political pieces are 
reminiscent of some Mexican muralists, including Diego Rivera, whose influence 
is noticeable in Kriegstein's "Amnesty" mural, which is prominently displayed 
at the larger B-1 Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not well-known and have only been shown in a few galleries," said 
Kriegstein, who lives in Santa Fe, N. M. "Robert bought my work because he 
really likes it. He's willing to take risks." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-born Berman was educated as a painter and sculptor at the Art Institute 
of Chicago, but soon became more interested in the commerce of art. Calling it 
an important part of the creative process, Berman decided to make art dealing 
his mission in life when he was only 19. 
</P>
<P>
After spending four years in Paris dealing in art and other collectibles, 
Berman settled in Santa Monica in 1978. On Hill Street, he started a gallery 
that lasted four years until he moved to Main Street, where he opened B-1. 
</P>
<P>
The raw qualities of the Venice/Santa Monica community that first attracted 
Berman have diminished with the recent growth of Main Street and the 
surrounding area, but he still finds the atmosphere worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot rougher than it is now, like a run-down downtown area," he said. 
"It's become very yuppified, but there are strong checks and balances in Santa 
Monica." 
</P>
<P>
Berman has his eye on the burgeoning Pacific Rim as a prime art-dealing 
territory of the future, a situation that he believes could catapult Los 
Angeles to the top of the contemporary art world much like New York was in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time for art in L. A. The Japanese and even the Europeans are 
looking here," said Berman, who has organized shows in Tokyo and is a prime 
mover behind the "Demon Angels" show, which he plans to catch up with Nov. 15 
for its opening in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has a chance to be the next vestige of creativity and commerce." 
</P>
<P>
Give Berman his wish, though, and he's collecting, not dealing. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to be able to accumulate enough great art that when I die, it will 
all be in a museum where they'll say, 'That was Robert Berman's collection.' 
That is the ultimate contribution I can probably leave."

LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS BRAINSTORM -- AND THE RESULT IS 'BRAIN DEATH'

<P>
What do "Six Women With Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know"? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question -- and title -- of Mark Houston's enquiring musical, 
reopening this weekend at Studio One's Backlot Theatre in West Hollywood. 
Houston, who's reprising his February staging at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, describes the piece as "an irreverent look at contemporary life -- with 
a great sense of humor and Angst. It's not letting the world eat you alive." 
</P>
<P>
The main target of the pop musical -- a series of comic sketches devised by 
Houston and half a dozen actress friends hoping to generate work for themselves 
-- is the glut of media "infotainment" and the erosion of values. 
</P>
<P>
"We started looking at tabloids, saying, 'What does this all mean?' " said 
Houston, who is credited with the show's music and lyrics. "We'd begun reading 
them for a lark, but after a while, you realize it's not just tabloids. It's 
every medium out there -- trying to catch your attention, trying to sell you 
something. If we don't have that sensationalism, we get bored. People magazine, 
the Star. The line gets blurred. But the effect is the same." 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's title might imply otherwise, tabloids are not the show's 
central target. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not the problem," said Houston, 42. "They're the far-end symptom taken 
to the nth degree. We also have the demand for 'Entertainment Tonight' and USA 
Today -- you know, 'McNews.' Our show starts with a real premise, then takes it 
to an absurd end." Such as? "There's a Barbie and Ken event, a discussion of 
the doll as icon. Then we take Barbie and Ken to Motel Hell. They get down and 
funky, discovering they have no genitals. It's a bad honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Houston, who was born and grew up in Texas, believes that going to that extreme 
was necessary to send his message home. "We are media brats," he said. "We want 
it quick, we want it entertaining and we want it colorful. At least, that's 
what we're told we want. It's only another step to tabloid dementia, that 
demand for instant attention. Then it's right on to the next thing. And 
everything's disconnected." 
</P>
<P>
Houston, who also directed "Six Women" in its original 1985 Kansas City, Mo., 
staging (a separate production recently ended a 15-month run at San Diego Rep), 
feels that the constant barrage of information also serves to squash old belief 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Things you used to think were true turn out not to be," he said with a sigh. 
"Old beliefs about God, old beliefs about the values that came to you out of 
movies and television -- generating a sense of what America was like." 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said cheerfully, is brain death. The antidote? "You need a bit 
of a jaded eye, something to keep perspective. . . . It's not like I'm pointing 
the finger, saying, 'Ooh, you're a bad culture.' I yearn for things to believe 
in. I yearn to believe in political events -- or that what's being told me 
about the world is true." 
</P>
<P>
He defines his outlook as one of healthy skepticism. "I think you have a 
responsibility to assess those messages, to pick up the carpet and see what's 
underneath. Not just to say, 'Well, it's fine that Jimmy Swaggart was playing 
with a prostitute in a motel room, asking if he could take pictures of her 
little girl -- and now he's back on TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Today, Eldridge Cleaver is a Republican, Jane Fonda is into 
aerobics. All the old images are colliding with the current stuff. And the need 
for belief is a dangerous thing. It can turn you into a zealot. Then you put 
blinders on: 'I don't care what you're saying. Jimmy Swaggart is right, and I 
will send him my money, to the detriment of my family -- because if I let go of 
the core of that belief, I'm cut adrift in this culture.' " 
</P>
<P>
He offers no easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you ever solve these things," Houston said. "But I had an 
English teacher who'd say, 'You don't know what you think till you can write it 
down.' So I try to make that mishmash into something concrete. I think that's 
what every artist tries to do."

<P>
AT ITS BEST, IT'S DECADENTLY GOOD HEALTH FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health food chefs, listen up: 
</P>
<P>
First learn how to cook, OK? Then subtract whatever evil ingredients your 
theories tell you to. But not before you know what you're doing. The other way 
-- deciding on the OK ingredients and then throwing them together in different 
ways, is why health food restaurants serve such a stunted, disfigured sort of 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if you had to invent health food cooking from scratch. 
Vegetarianism, for instance, has been practiced for centuries by many Hindus 
and Buddhists. They made most of their gastronomic mistakes a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
Go then and learn from them. Go to the Fragrant Vegetable Chinese Vegetarian 
Restaurant in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Or go to the new Fragrant Vegetable on the Westside, which, like the original, 
has a color scheme of peaceful green but is more luxurious and restaurant-like. 
Instead of simple Buddhist devotional art, there are fine wooden sculptures of 
the Eight Drunken Immortals of Chinese folklore. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, behold what can be done with vegetables. Instead of slovenly soyburgers 
or nutburgers, the Fragrant Vegetable makes vegetarian "meats" from tofu or 
wheat gluten that match the consistency of meat almost perfectly. Often the 
flavor is fairly close, but even when it's not, it's at least pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
In the plate of cold appetizers, the lemon chicken is uncannily like chicken 
skin, the roast pork could almost be pork, and the spicy beef (heavy on the 
star anise) at least tastes good. 
</P>
<P>
Meat, and sometimes fish, is mimicked in even stranger ways. "Mashed taro fish" 
is taro mashed with some other pureed vegetables and arranged in the shape of a 
fish. Scales are drawn on; a pea represents the eye. The effect is a lot like 
deep-fried mashed potatoes with a less floury texture. And "Peking ribs" do 
not, in truth, taste or even look a whole lot like sweet and sour spareribs, 
but they are very good: pecans ("Peking" is a pun, see) in sweet and sour sauce 
with pineapple chunks. 
</P>
<P>
Even better than the mock meats are the mushroom dishes and wilder non-animal 
edibles. For instance, the centerpiece of Buddha's cushions, a dish that 
includes mushrooms and spinach, is made up of the cushions themselves: thin 
sheets of tofu wrapped around a substance called black moss. It has an 
unforgettable rich, loamy aroma, not blamelessly vegetable-like at all but like 
some strange, long-stewed meat. 
</P>
<P>
And for my money, the best dessert on the menu is white fungus and coconut 
soup, which the kitchen will prepare for four or more people. This is slightly 
sweet coconut milk -- actually a soup, served hot -- with a noble white fungus 
floating in the middle like a Spanish caravel. The stuff looks like a 
disembodied brain from outer space, but it has a pleasant, extremely delicate 
flavor and a wonderful texture, crunchy without being crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, dishes that could be served in any Chinese restaurant and 
be worthy of notice. I'm thinking of things like string beans in hot bean 
sauce, actually Sichuan beans, I'd say. Even apart from the entertaining idea 
of beans served in bean sauce, they're perfectly delicious; the black bean 
sauce is hot, sour and garlicky -- unless, of course, you ask that garlic be 
omitted. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the Fragrant Vegetable serves fixed-price lunches, not only the 
sort of dishes found on its regular menu but also vegetarian versions of 
conventional Chinese dishes like twice-cooked pork (better for texture than 
taste) and a variety of noodle dishes. I've tried the fried broad rice noodle 
Malaysian style and found it had a nice curry sauce, plus bell pepper, sprouts, 
green onion and vegetarian "pork" in it. 
</P>
<P>
It also had bits of egg, and so does the fried rice, because people expect egg 
in such dishes; those who don't eat eggs should ask that they be omitted. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: cold appetizers, $5.25; Buddha's cushions, $8.95; string 
beans with hot sauce, $6.95; white fungus and coconut soup, $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Fragrant Vegetable Restaurant, 11859 Wilshire Blvd., West Los Angeles. (213) 
312-1442. Open for lunch and dinner daily, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wine and beer. 
Validated parking at lot on Westgate Avenue. Major credit cards accepted.

Striking Ohio Bell telephone workers reached a tentative agreement on a 
contract, but picket lines will likely stay up until other strikes against 
Chicago-based Ameritech are settled, officials said. After a brief session at a 
Cleveland hotel, negotiators returned a few hours later and signed the 
agreement -- a three-year contract that covers about 10,100 workers. But the 
Communications Workers of America, which called for a strike against Ohio Bell 
just after midnight on Aug. 13, urged its Ohio Bell locals to stay off the job 
and on the picket lines until five other labor disputes in the Ameritech system 
are resolved. Ameritech includes Ohio Bell, Indiana Bell, Illinois Bell, 
Wisconsin Bell, Michigan Bell and the regional Ameritech Services Inc. Terms of 
the settlement were not revealed.

Polls in Boston showed that Rep. Barney Frank's constituents still strongly 
support him, despite revelations about the congressman's relationship with a 
male prostitute. A poll conducted for the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV showed that 
65.3% did not think Frank should resign, while 22.3% said he should. At the 
same time, a survey by the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV showed that 56% said Frank 
deserves to be reelected, while 29% called for his ouster. The state Republican 
Party has also called for the Massachusetts Democrat's resignation, charging 
that Frank, 49, showed a "profound lack of judgment." However, political 
observers predicted that the fifth-term congressman, who publicly acknowledged 
his homosexuality in 1987, would survive the scandal.

NEWSMAKERS: THEY CONTEMPLATE THE OCEAN WITH A SENSE OF WONDER

 -- You've heard of the seven seas and the Seven Wonders of the World, so why 
not the seven underwater wonders of the world. A panel of 14 marine scientists, 
conservationists and explorers named the sites to draw attention to the 
underwater environment and to urge a global effort to protect it. Former 
astronaut Scott Carpenter, now an environmental consultant, said: "We're 
killing the oceans . . . . The ocean is a very delicate entity and people don't 
realize that." Rick Sammon, president of CEDAM International, a nonprofit group 
of marine scientists and conservationists that sponsored the panel, said: "If a 
concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and preserve our underwater 
wonders, they -- like the classic Seven Wonders of the World -- could be lost 
forever through carelessness, negligence or deliberate mistreatment." The 
panel's list: Palau, an island group in Micronesia; the northern Red Sea; 
Australia's Great Barrier Reef; the waters of the Galapagos Islands off 
Ecuador; Siberia's Lake Baikal; the Belize Barrier Reef, and the deep ocean 
vents in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The panel gave an honorable mention 
to whales, as one of seas' great living wonders.

 -- A Miami couple who survived 66 days in a life raft in the Pacific returned 
home, each more than 50 pounds lighter. "We're going to rest -- and go away 
from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies," William Butler, 
59, said. Butler and his wife, Simone Butler, 56, said their boat was sunk by 
whales and they fended off sharks and subsisted on fish they caught and 
desalinated seawater. The couple was rescued by the Costa Rican Coast Guard. 
Waiting for them at the airport with other relatives and friends was Jessica 
Butler, the 2-month-old granddaughter born after they began their voyage.

 -- Japanese Emperer Akihito's second son, Prince Aya, 23, has received 
permission to marry Kiko Kawashima, 22, a graduate student he has been seeing 
for four years. Palace and government officials made no official announcement 
but nearly all large newspapers and television networks carried the news about 
the prince who is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Kawashima, who 
met the prince at Tokyo's Gakushuin University, sparked speculation about an 
engagement announcement when she visited the Akasaka Palace with her parents. 
The engagement must be approved by the Imperial Council, led by Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu. DAVE JOHNSON

Two Hungarians who took part in a Prague protest on the 21st anniversary of the 
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia were ordered by a district court in the 
capital to stand trial. The decision to try Tamas Deutsch and Gyorgy Kerenyi 
came after a prosecutor demanded that they be punished for violating public 
order. The two were among a group of Hungarian activists who on Monday unfurled 
a banner proclaiming "The Bolsheviks Came With Tanks, We Come With Flowers." 
Thousands of Czechoslovaks cheered their action before police charged the 
crowds and arrested 320 Czechs and 56 foreigners, including other Hungarians, 
Poles, Italians and Dutch.

Military and civilian aircraft backed by ground troops scanned remote areas of 
the Himalayas for a second day but found no trace of a Pakistani airliner 
missing with 54 people on board. Officials of the state-run Pakistan 
International Airlines in Islamabad said the search was suspended overnight for 
the PIA Fokker-27 that disappeared early Friday shortly after taking off from 
the resort city of Gilgit on a 190-mile flight to Islamabad. On board the 
missing plane were 49 passengers, including five infants, and five crew 
members. Among the passengers were two foreigners, American journalist Paul 
McGorrian and a woman identified on the passenger list only as Sibrys, 
nationality unknown.

A former Oakland School District payroll clerk is accused of using her Bible 
study group in a scheme to embezzle more than $24,000 from the district, police 
reported. Marie Louise Bell, 48, was arrested at her Richmond home on a warrant 
charging her with grand theft. Police said Bell masterminded a kickback scheme 
in which overtime and payroll records of some custodians were allegedly 
falsified. Officers said Bell apparently selected the custodians at random and 
on their paychecks would occasionally pay each of them a minimum of "several 
hundred dollars for unworked overtime." After the custodians received their 
first overtime payment, officer said Bell then contacted them and essentially 
said, "If you like what we're doing we can keep it up, but I get some."

A healthy Humphrey the whale is back in the San Francisco Bay Area but is 
showing no signs of returning to the Sacramento River, where he spent 25 days 
in 1985 while the world watched and countless efforts were made to send him 
back to sea. For each of the four years since then Humphrey, identified by 
unique markings on his dorsal fin and fluke, has returned to the waters off San 
Francisco. This year he was spotted by biologists swimming near the Farallon 
Islands. Not so lucky are two ailing beaked whales, nicknamed Nicholas and 
Alexander, which are being treated at Marine World/Africa USA in Vallejo. 
Veterinarian Laurie Gage said the condition of the young whales was somewhat 
better than when they were found on Ocean Beach, but they are not eating and 
their chances for survival are not good.

West Germany is preparing to charge a former U.S. Army sergeant with treason 
for his alleged role in a spy ring that sold North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
secrets to the Soviets, Der Spiegel magazine reported. The Hamburg-based 
publication said federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe are preparing to charge Clyde 
Lee Conrad, 42, a native of Sebring, Ohio, who was arrested in August, 1988. 
Der Spiegel said it would be the first time in West German history that a 
foreigner faced such charges. Authorities suspect that Conrad acted as 
ringleader of an international spy network that sold the Soviets information 
about NATO's nuclear missiles, bases and troop strengths.

OAKLAND CHEERS ITS FORMER TEAM IN 23-21 DEFEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
For a brief moment, the once-and-perhaps future Oakland Raiders rode again, 
almost as in days of yore. Steve Beuerlein rallied them in the fourth quarter 
the way George Blanda used to, and the local population threw a 
silver-and-black party for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
What Los Angeles, which will be their home for the rest of the season, got out 
of it, is something else. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Oilers chewed them up and spit them out in the first half when it 
was first string-on-first string, outgaining them, 203-9. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Oilers' second string that snatched the Raiders' first 
exhibition victory from their jaws, driving 47 yards in the closing seconds for 
the winning touchdown. Allen Pinkett went the last yard untouched and the 
Oilers won, 23-21, Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 50,642 in Oakland 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are 0-3. The crowd that cheered them, the Raiderettes, the replays 
and the fireworks obviously lifted them, but aside from looking more excited, 
they showed as many holes as they had playing before 31,000 in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they are still a team in transition. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Matt Millen, a starter since the team was playing here, was benched 
for Jackie Shipp. Millen told friends he has been informed by the coaching 
staff that he will be traded. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Haynes, fighting to hold his job, had his problems. Todd Christensen took 
a victory lap around the stadium during warmups and was cheered loudly, but was 
held out. James Lofton played sparingly. All are in trouble and some could even 
go in this week's cut to 60. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein entered the game midway through the fourth quarter and drove the 
Raiders 74 yards, 53 of it on a completion to the other exhibition sensation, 
Mike Alexander. Beuerlein then threw a seven-yard swing pass to fullback Steve 
Strachan, who ran over a Houston safety and put the Raiders ahead, 21-16, 
giving local football fans their best moment of the second half of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers then took over at the Raider 47 with 1:49 left and drove behind 
backup quarterback Cody Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
From the Raider two, Carlson threw into the end zone and was intercepted by 
Raider linebacker Thomas Benson, giving the locals their second-best moment. 
But the play was called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, with seven seconds left from the Raider one, Carlson started 
left, drew the Raider defense and pitched to Pinkett, who scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
The locals are hoping for better things next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The night started in the morning. The parking lot next to Oakland Coliseum was 
opened at 9 a.m. and filled by vans and barbecuers by 10. Some hard partying 
ensued. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd might be a little short," said Raider executive assistant Al 
LoCasale shortly before the 7 p.m. game time, smiling. "Some of these people 
will never make it in here." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd went batty all through warmups. The team was introduced only as "the 
Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Sentimentalists, the Raiders sent their only three players who had played here 
-- Millen, Christensen and Howie Long -- out to call the coin toss. Of the 
three, only Long is certain to make the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
They lost the toss. The game began. 
</P>
<P>
They went ahead, 7-0, when free agent cornerback Dan Land intercepted a pass by 
Warren Moon that receiver Leonard Harris had tipped. Land returned it 10 yards 
to the Houston 12. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Willie Gault shook Oiler cornerback Steve Brown off in the end 
zone, got open and caught Jay Schroeder's pass. Jeff Jaeger kicked the point. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Raider highlights in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder went three for 10 and was sacked twice. The Raider rushing game got 
seven yards in six carries. There were no more first downs. At halftime, the 
Oilers had outgained them, 203-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers settled for three field goals by Tony Zendejas, from 24, 26 and 
finally from 53 yards, the last with four seconds left, for a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tight end report: The first time both players were healthy, the Raiders started 
young Mike Dyal with the first unit. Todd Christensen wasn't brought on until 
late, suggesting that he is in trouble, and could even go in Monday's cut. . . 
. Cornerback wars (continued): Mike Haynes started, but he often came out in 
favor of Lionel Washington in passing situations. Haynes was also beaten three 
times on a single drive, on crossing patterns by Houston's Haywood Jeffires, 
for 28, 18 and 17 yards. The Raider coaches had said that Haynes is having 
trouble covering those patterns, so the veteran could be in trouble.

Trainer Charlie Whittingham proved before the race how confident he was in 
Lively One's chances to win Saturday's $212,800 Cabrillo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
He scratched You're No Bargain, who figured to battle Speedratic for the lead 
and set up the finish for Lively One. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't need him," Whittingham said before the race. "Besides, I don't want 
anyone saying my other horse needed something to soften up the pace for him." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens took Speedratic out to an easy lead, but Lively One ran him down 
with a final furlong in barely 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Favored at 2-5, Lively One finished 1 3/4 lengths in front of Speedratic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got outrun," said Stevens, who restrained Speedratic through an 
opening half-mile in :47 1/5. Under normal circumstances, such a slow pace 
would put most front-runners in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
But Lively One has shown new life this summer for Whittingham, adding the 1 
1/8-mile Cabrillo to his victory in the Aug. 5 San Diego Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, the son of Halo had gone for more than a year without winning a 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, Lively One outclassed his four Cabrillo rivals. But his jockey, 
Robbie Davis, was far from encouraged as the field entered the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was pumping turning for home," said Davis. "That other horse 
(Speedratic) was hanging in game. Around the turn, I thought he'd come back to 
me, but instead he opened up." 
</P>
<P>
Davis went to work on Lively One with a right-handed whip and got an immediate 
response. The 4-year-old colt kicked into another gear and passed Speedratic 
without a battle. 
</P>
<P>
Putting, a French turf horse making only his second start on the dirt, closed 
well along the inside to be third, 1 1/4 lengths behind Speedratic. Honor Medal 
was fourth and Rogue's Realm completed the field. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One was timed in 1:47 and paid $3.20, $2.20 and $2.10, causing a minus 
show pool that cost the track $2,311. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham was not sure what Lively One would be doing next, but another shot 
in the Breeders' Cup Classic later in the year is a definite possibility. The 
colt ran eighth in that race last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This might have been the best race he ever ran," Whittingham said. "And he's 
getting better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens fell twice Saturday, in the first race immediately after the start 
and in the second race, approaching the far turn, when a horse in front of him 
clipped heels and fell. "It had been awhile since I'd gone down," Stevens said. 
"I was trying to make up for it all at once." Depsite suffering a deep bruise 
on his right upper arm, Stevens bounced back to win the third race on Stormy 
But Valid and later took the ninth on Spirit Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Apprentice Tony Guymon, whose mount triggered the second race spill, suffered a 
broken collarbone in the incident. Fernando Valenzuela also went down in the 
second race, but was unhurt. . . . Darrel McHargue, the Eclipse Award-winning 
jockey of 1978, has his first assignment as a steward at Turf Paradise in 
Phoenix beginning Oct. 6. McHargue is a patrol judge at Del Mar. . . . San 
Clemente Handicap winner Darby's Daughter heads a field of nine 3-year-old 
fillies in today's Del Mar Oaks. The opposition includes Stylish Star, General 
Charge, Kelly, Bel Darling, Double Diplomat, Tapping Tudor and Black Stockings 
and the maiden Noble and Nice.

Winning Colors, the 1988 Kentucky Derby winner who underwent throat surgery 
three months ago, scored a 4 1/4-length victory in a six-furlong allowance for 
fillies and mares at Saratoga Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors, trained by Wayne Lukas and ridden by Pat Day, was timed in 1:10 
1/5 and earned $24,600 from the purse of $41,000 for her first victory since 
the Derby. Winning Colors returned $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas said that the only visible effect of her surgery had been that "she was a 
little louder after lengthy gallops." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, also ridden by Day, won the $234,000 Hopeful Stakes for 
2-year-olds later in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Storm Bird-Weekend Surprise remained undefeated in five career 
starts, the last four of which have been stakes, covering 6 1/2 furlongs in 
1:16 4/5. Summer Squall returned $3.80.

JOHNSON IS SHARP IN UCLA SCRIMMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Bret Johnson completed 13 of 17 passes for 166 yards 
Saturday in the Rose Bowl in UCLA's first full-scale scrimmage of fall 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' other would-be starting quarterback, sophomore Jim Bonds, completed 
10 of 15 passes for 96 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought both quarterbacks did some really nice things," said Coach Terry 
Donahue, who is not expected to name a starter until the week before UCLA opens 
its season Sept. 9 against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson led the only two scoring drives, moving the offense 50 yards and then 
55 yards to touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The first touchdown was scored on a 22-yard run by Ricky Davis, a freshman 
tailback from Germantown, Md., who carried 22 times for 125 yards, in the 
absence of Brian Brown and Shawn Wills, who sat out with minor injuries. Brown 
had a slight concussion Friday in practice and Wills sprained an ankle 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams, the Bruins' ballyhooed freshman tailback, carried 15 times for 
24 yards. JERRY CROWE

Danny Green and Chris Patton, both newcomers on the national amateur scene, 
each won twice Saturday, and will meet in the final of the 89th annual U.S. 
Amateur Golf Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Green, 32, of Jackson, Tenn., eliminated two-time champion Jay Sigel, 1-up, on 
the 19th hole in a morning quarterfinal. He returned to Merion Golf Club's 
6,523-yard, par-70 course in the afternoon, beating Jerry Courville, 30, of 
Norwalk, Conn., 2-up, to qualify for today's 36-hole final. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, 21, a Clemson senior from Fountain Inn., S.C., whose best this year was 
a fifth in the South Carolina State Amateur, defeated Michael Brannan, 33, a 
golf equipment salesman from Trumbull, Conn., 3 and 2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Patton eliminated Kevin Wentworth, an Oklahoma State senior from 
Manteca, Calif., 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who attended the University of Tennessee at Martin, blew a 2-up lead 
with two holes to play against Sigel. But Sigel struggled on 19, and wound up 
conceding a birdie putt and the match. 
</P>
<P>
Green, trailing Sigel by a hole at the turn in the morning round, evened the 
match with a birdie at the 10th. He edged ahead at 12 with a birdie, and 
boosted his lead to 2-up with another at 15. 
</P>
<P>
They halved the 16th, leaving Sigel two down with two holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Sigel, in his 23rd Amateur including titles in 1982 and '83, hung in with an 
18-foot birdie putt at 17. 
</P>
<P>
Sigel, 45, won 18 and deadlocked the match as Green three-putted. 
</P>
<P>
The two moved to a first extra hole with some 3,000 fans, mostly rooting for 
Sigel from nearby Berwyn, Pa., lining the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
Sigel's tee shot landed in a divot. He hit into a trap, blasted out 15 feet 
past the pin and missed the putt coming back. He conceded a six-foot birdie 
putt to Green, who was on in two.

ERRATIC STEWART GAINS SHARE OF SERIES LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PGA champion Payne Stewart overcame the potential disaster of a double bogey to 
move into a three-way tie for the third-round lead Saturday in the World Series 
of Golf at Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart had an erratic 68 -- six birdies, two bogeys, a double bogey -- on the 
Firestone Country Club course and finished 54 holes at 207, three under par. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied with Paul Azinger, who shot 67, and David Frost, who shot a 69, but 
quickly pointed out that "a lot of guys have a chance to win this; certainly 
everybody on the board there." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart gestured to a leaderboard that showed nine players under par, including 
Ben Crenshaw, Australia's Greg Norman and defending champion Mike Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, a winner last week in Castle Rock, Colo., Crenshaw, and Jones, the only 
three-time winner on the American tour this year, were a stroke off the lead at 
208, two under par. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had a 69, and Norman matched par with a 70. Crenshaw, who led through the 
first two rounds, had his second consecutive 72. 
</P>
<P>
Reid was tied at 209 with Corey Pavin and Larry Mize. Pavin had a third-round 
68; Reid and Mize shot 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was three under par after six holes and appeared ready to pull away 
from the pack until he bogeyed the seventh and chopped up the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
After driving into the rough on No. 8, he hit into a greenside bunker, overshot 
the green and made double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
That dropped him back to even for the day, and he had to make a 45-foot putt to 
save par on the ninth. He played the back nine in 33, making a 15-footer on the 
15th to regain a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mogg, boosted by an ace at the 201-yard seventh hole, turned in a 
seven-under-par 63 to become the leader in the clubhouse at 10 under par before 
lightning and rain suspended third-round play at the $500,000 Hamilton 
County-Chattanooga tournament at Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Mogg, who set a course record with a front nine of six-under-par 29, was one of 
36 golfers in the field of 83 to complete the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Schultz, the 36-hole leader at 11 under, parred his first two holes before 
play was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
PGA officials announced the third round will be picked up this morning with the 
final round of the 72-hole tournament to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King , a five-time winner this season, rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on 
the 17th hole to take a one-shot lead after the third round of the $265,000 
LPGA World Championship tournament at Buford, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
King shot a two-under par 70 for a 54-hole score of 207, nine shots under par 
on the hilly, 6,107-yard Pine Isle Resort course. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley and second-round leader Patty Sheehan are tied for second. Bradley 
made the big charge of the day, shooting a 68. Sheehan had a 72. 
</P>
<P>
Dottie Mochrie pitched in a 96-yard wedge shot for an eagle on the 14th hole en 
route to a five-under 67 and a share of the lead at 140 with Tina Barrett after 
two rounds of the LPGA Ocean State Open at Cranston, R.I. Barrett shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles, seeking his third consecutive victory in this event, shot a 
three-under-par 69 and held a one-stroke lead over Charles Coody and Jim Dent 
after two rounds of the Charley Pride Senior tournament at Albuquerque, N.M.. 
</P>
<P>
Charles has a 36-hole total of nine-under 135. Coody, who began the day tied 
with Charles for the lead after an opening 66, struggled to a 70 whereas Dent 
matched Charles' 69.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: A DEATH PIQUES INVESTORS' INTEREST IN HAWAIIAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a number of reasons why the stock of Honolulu-based Alexander &amp; 
Baldwin Inc. should have been rediscovered by Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The stock should be rediscovered because the takeover battle for Sea 
Containers, a British company, has refocused attention on the long-forgotten 
value of container shipping operations, such as the one owned by Alexander 
&amp; Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
And Alexander &amp; Baldwin shares should also be getting more attention 
because the company owns valuable real estate in California as well as almost 
96,000 acres of Hawaiian land. With Japanese investors having a seemingly 
insatiable appetite for land, especially in the Pacific, that could mean that 
Alexander &amp; Baldwin's assets are vastly undervalued by the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
But those weren't the reasons that Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock rose $4 a 
share, or more than 11%, in unusually heavy trading recently. Embarrassing as 
it is to admit, the real cause of the jump was the death of the wife of a guy 
who tried to take control of the company a number of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forgot About Company 
</P>
<P>
Let's take this one step at a time. Harry Weinberg, a Hawaiian businessman and 
investor, was a member of the Alexander &amp; Baldwin board until he turned 
rebel in 1985. At the time, Weinberg owned about 14% of Alexander &amp; 
Baldwin's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg, who is 82 or so, failed in his attempt to take control of Alexander 
&amp; Baldwin's board, and eventually he sold most of his stock back to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
But that still left him with a hunk of Alexander &amp; Baldwin stock still 
under his control. And analysts say Weinberg's estimated 5.6% holding has 
always made Alexander &amp; Baldwin vulnerable to another takeover try. And the 
most likely time for any such coup would be upon Weinberg's death. 
</P>
<P>
Harry is said to be ailing, but he's still around. And Wall Street eventually 
forgot about the takeover potential of Alexander &amp; Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts forgot about it, that is, until earlier this month, when Jeanette 
Weinberg, Harry's wife, passed away in Baltimore. Suddenly, Wall Street's 
ghoulish interest in Alexander &amp; Baldwin seemed to be rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Weinberg's obituary ran in the Hawaiian newspapers Aug. 14 and 15. On 
Aug. 14, Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock closed at $35.25 on volume of just 
37,650 shares in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Trading picked up Aug. 15, when volume jumped to 77,500 shares. But Alexander 
&amp; Baldwin's stock was still at $35.25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undervalued Stock 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 16, the day after the obit ran, Wall Street finally rediscovered 
Alexander &amp; Baldwin's stock. It jumped $2.50 that day on volume of 349,860 
shares and another $1.50 the following day on volume of 374,655 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the stock backtracked a bit as investors seemed to come to their 
senses. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander &amp; Baldwin is probably no more -- or no less -- a takeover 
candidate today than it was a month ago. But the death of Mrs. Weinberg, and 
the stock activity that it seemed to produce, has caused the few Wall Street 
analysts who follow the company to take a closer look at its assets. And what 
they see is a company whose stock price should be higher. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald B. Morrow, who tracks the company for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; 
Co., estimates that Alexander &amp; Baldwin could be worth between $50 and $55 
a share in a buyout. O. Lee Tawes of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. is a little more 
generous at $60. 
</P>
<P>
Tawes thinks that Alexander &amp; Baldwin's shipping business could be worth 
between $30 and $35 a share if taken private, and its real estate could be 
worth about $25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Alexander &amp; Baldwin's value, Tawes says, lies in its sugar 
business and the securities that it owns, including a big stake in Bank of 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
While Alexander &amp; Baldwin has taken some defensive measures against a 
takeover attempt, the company management doesn't own a lot of stock. So company 
insiders won't have a lot of say if push comes to shove in a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some drawbacks for anyone attempting to take over Alexander &amp; 
Baldwin. Sally Smith, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, and others say it 
is a well-run company. So criticism of Alexander &amp; Baldwin's management 
might not get a raider far. 
</P>
<P>
And most of that real estate, while developable, will have to be rezoned before 
anyone would be able to cut down the sugar cane and put up, say, a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander &amp; Baldwin's management might have some say in just how 
cooperative local authorities are with any raider. 
</P>
<P>
Two female sociologists will contend in a new book that many of the inroads 
that women have made in previous male-oriented occupations occured because men 
no longer wanted the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Roos, a sociologist at Rutgers University, and Barbara Reskin, 
professor of sociology at the University of Illinois, will make that and other 
disconcerting points in an upcoming book titled "Job Queues, Gender Queues" 
(Temple University Press). 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of the gains" for women in previously male-dominated jobs "have 
been exaggerated," says Reskin. "Women get in because the jobs have become less 
attractive to men." 
</P>
<P>
Reskin and Roos drew their conclusions after studying 14 occupations for two 
years each. Women have made progress, the researchers say, infiltrating the 
pharmacology profession as well as getting jobs as insurance adjusters, 
typesetters and bank managers. 
</P>
<P>
The two sociologists say women are still better off by taking these jobs. On 
average, they earn between 65% and 70% of what the men earned for the same 
position, which is better than they normally do. 
</P>
<P>
But the two scientists also found that even within the male bastions where 
women were admitted, there was segregation of the sexes. "In every single case 
within each occupation, men and women are segregated into different jobs." 
Women, for instance, generally get jobs selling residential real estate, while 
men still dominate commercial real estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
The two contend that women make out best when some outside force -- such as a 
government affirmative action program -- takes up their cause. 
</P>
<P>
The book is due out sometime next year. 
</P>

Wall Street is apparently justified in trying to keep track of Pennzoil's 
activities in the securities markets. According to a filing made recently by 
Pennzoil with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had $1.4 
billion invested in marketable securities at the end of June, compared to just 
$983 million last December. Sorry, folks, but Pennzoil wasn't specific as to 
where it was investing all of that loot. Wall Street has been waiting for 
Pennzoil to spend some of the billions that it won in a lawsuit against Texaco 
on an acquisition . . . 
</P>
<P>
The wise guys on Wall Street are calling last week's agreement to acquire 
Hawaiian Airlines a "takeunder," since the $22-a-share price that ex-baseball 
Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth is paying is well under what the stock of HAL 
Inc., the parent company, was selling for on the open market . . . 
</P>
<P>
Naughty, Naughty. That's what some honest traders were saying Thursday morning 
after Holiday Corp. announced that it was selling its hotel chain as part of a 
big restructuring. Holiday's stock had risen nearly $8 a share the day before, 
and even an investigator with a stuffy nose could smell inside trading. The New 
York Stock Exchange is already on the case, and the SEC shouldn't be far 
behind. Holiday Corp., incidentally, did something naughty too when it publicly 
announced Wednesday that it didn't know why its stock was moving higher. Could 
it be that its multibillion-dollar deal just happened overnight? . . . As 
analysts predicted here a few weeks ago, most hotel and casino stocks got hot 
right after Holiday's big announcement . . . 
</P>
<P>
Program trading helped push the stock market to record levels last week. Should 
investors be worried once again that the tail (program trading) is again 
wagging the dog (the market) as it seemed to do when the market crashed in 
1987? 
</P>
<P>
The father of the program trade, Jeffrey Tabak of Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; 
Co., says investors have nothing to worry about in 1989. Even though program 
trading activity is still very strong, the investment technique isn't likely to 
cause any great programs for the market, Tabak claims. 
</P>
<P>
Tabak, whose firm executed the first program trade in the early 1980s, argues 
that the real culprit in the '87 crash was portfolio insurance, an investment 
technique which essentially caused institutional investors to sell stocks en 
masse when the price of equities started to slide. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio insurance also used computers to trade bundles of stocks quickly, but 
it isn't true program trading, whose purpose is to trade -- or arbitrage -- 
stocks to make up any discrepancy between the stock and options markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Because portfolio insurance, the real villain, is now dead, people needn't be 
concerned with true program trading," Tabak says. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio insurance isn't used much anymore. When the technique didn't "insure" 
anybody against losses in the '87 crash -- and may, in fact, have contributed 
to losses -- most institutional investors just dropped the system and moved on 
to other things. 
</P>
<P>
But program trading -- the arbitrage kind -- hasn't gone away, and probably 
never will. In fact, the use of computers to execute large trades quickly has 
been prospering. 
</P>
<P>
According to the New York Stock Exchange, 9.4% of its average daily volume in 
July was executed through program trades. While the number has been 
fluctuating, many market experts think that program trades are still visible 
enough to scare small investors out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Program trading really only brings liquidity to the market, which helps 
everyone," Tabak says. Liquidity, for those who don't speak the language, means 
that you'll be able to get the hell out of the stock market quickly the next 
time that it's headed for a crash.

ON VIEW: ART MAVENS CONVERGE ON BEVERLY HILLS

Diane D. Brooks, Sotheby's president, doesn't mince words. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very small part of a large collection -- the most important 
collection that has ever come to auction in the world," she said, referring to 
a recently displayed sampling of works of art -- Old Masters, Impressionist, 
modern and 19th-Century European and American paintings, silver, Chinese 
porcelain and European ceramics -- assembled by the late John T. Dorrance Jr., 
former chairman of Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, including more than 200 paintings, is expected to fetch more 
than $100 million in what should be a dizzying New York sale and social 
occasion par excellence in October. 
</P>
<P>
But even the few works flashed recently in Beverly Hills -- 14 Impressionist 
paintings flown by Sotheby's for a Rodeo Drive showing and dinner hosted by 
Andrea Van de Kamp, the dealer's new West Coast vice president-managing 
director -- dazzled a spiffy coterie of assembled collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Who was that examining "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge, Assise de Profil," the 
Matisse expected to bring in $4 million to $6 million? Why, of course, it was 
Harold Williams, the Getty Museum chairman who is experienced at buying Renoirs 
for $17 million, and former Secretary of the Treasury William Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent Impressionist collectors taking in the scene were Frances Brody and 
William and Ginger Crowell of San Francisco. The contingent of contemporary 
collectors was awesome and included Marcia Weisman; Fred and Joan Nicholas; Bea 
and Philip Gersh; and Diane and Harold Keith. They all touched base with Museum 
of Contemporary Art director Richard Koshalek and his wife, Betty. The 
20th-Century collectors seen included Marion and Nathan Smooke and Jean Howard, 
whose book on Hollywood is due in mid-October from Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of Los Angeles' ascendence as a major art world center, Michael 
L. Ainslie, the handsome president of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., buzzed into town 
at the last minute when John Marion, Sotheby's American chairman, unexpectedly 
had to return to New York from Santa Fe to look at a painting. Marvin and 
Barbara Davis also canceled at the last minute; that's the way it is with these 
jet-setting pacesetters. 
</P>
<P>
The works garnering the most attention at the Beverly Hills gathering were Van 
Gogh's "L'Homme est en Mer," expected to bring $10 million to $15 million and 
the early Picasso "Au Moulin Rouge," expected to bring $6 million to $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Crowding about those works were: Eleanor Colt and Michael Morrison; Bronya and 
Andrew Galef; Roger and Joanne Kozberg; David McCallum; Peter and Casey McCoy; 
and Helen and Mace Neufeld. They all garnered art tidbits from Barbara 
Pallenberg, Sotheby's regional director of fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
For dinner, the lights were dimmed. But afterward, John Van de Kamp, the state 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate who sat next to Brooks at dinner, nudged his 
wife, Andrea, and urged: "Turn up the lights, so that everyone can see the 
paintings again!" 
</P>
<P>
DEBUT: Jeffrey Rusinow, newly named senior vice president and director of 
Bullock's 22 stores in the Southwest, has been rehearsing 10 months since 
winning the chance to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic as top auction 
bidder with co-bidder Jack McCarley at the Philharmonic Ball. He was on the 
podium at the Hollywood Bowl, striking the first beat of the Star Spangled 
Banner. There were cheers aplenty from: Persis McCarley; Fran Muir, who chaired 
the ball that raised $120,000 for the orchestra; next year's ball chairwoman 
Joan Riach; new Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic president Judy Bartholomew and 
her husband, Leon (they drove in from their new home in Montecito); Mary and 
James Hesburgh; Ginger and David Ludwick; Shauna Trabert and Carl Honeystein, 
and Susan and Rufus Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
SUMMER CHEERS: Maurice and Carol Inman joined the support team for West Coast 
University by hosting 47 Taiwanese senior executives at a reception in their 
Bel-Air home . . . Mary Crary served tea at her home to introduce new members 
of the Autumn Cotillion to the advisory board and ball committee. New members 
are Laurie Griff, Betsy Link, Amanda McIntyre and Carole Terry . . . And Donna 
Wolff chaired a rewarding volunteer job: for the fifth year, she organized hair 
stylists from Vidal Sassoon in Beverly Hills to spend a morning at Vista del 
Mar, styling the hair of 90 abused children. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To Phoebe Vaccaro, Nancy Call, Bette McLaughlin and Donna Gibbs,

DEBATE OVER RIGHTS OF TRAILER OCCUPANTS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY THREATENED WITH EVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
When Susan Britt and her children were accepted by the new homeless trailer 
program in West Los Angeles, she thought they were getting a roof over their 
heads for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Britt, her 17-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter moved in to the comfy, 
furnished two-bedroom trailer in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Within six weeks, however, Britt and the kids were on their way out. The 
Salvation Army, which runs the transitional housing program in partnership with 
Los Angeles and the federal government, had threatened to "evict" her. 
Ultimately, she was charged with 22 infractions, many of which she disputes. 
Britt, in turn, alleged harassment from officials who hovered over her trailer, 
constantly accusing her of breaking rules, and, in general, made her life 
miserable. "I was going to be out there for real on the streets," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
It was an unexpected turnabout. The college-educated secretary had been 
handpicked to be one of the first families in the Westside trailer enclave, 
which opened in February as part of a multi-agency citywide program championed 
by Mayor Tom Bradley to "bridge the gap between homelessness and mainstream 
society." 
</P>
<P>
She had also won an award from Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana for the 
progress she had made in her three months in a temporary shelter program in 
Venice. Before that, life had been a stream of cheap motels, and when there was 
no money or vouchers, the car was home. 
</P>
<P>
The West Los Angeles trailers, unlike some of the city's other 61 trailers 
placed within housing projects, is in a decidedly upscale environ. The 15 
trailers sit in the shadow of Westwood skyscrapers on a strip of federal land 
on Sepulveda Boulevard. Northbound drivers on the San Diego Freeway can spot 
the roofs of the trailers beyond the shrubbery at the Wilshire Boulevard 
off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The much-vaunted experimental program, a sort of halfway house for homeless 
families, seeks to offer stable housing and support for those with the 
potential, persistence and motivation to make a comeback. Six months is the 
maximum stay. 
</P>
<P>
Freed from the daily worry of where the kids are going to sleep that night, a 
parent can refocus energies on finding a job, obtaining training or counseling 
and, perhaps most important, squirreling away enough money for the first and 
last month's rent of permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
A list of rules, seemingly in no particular order, given to each resident 
forbids everything from drug use to knocking on the manager's door between 10 
a.m. and 4 p.m. Visitors must sign in for the three hours per weekday they are 
permitted on the grounds. (Weekend visiting hours are longer.) Guests are then 
subject to an impromptu background check by being asked who they are and what 
their business is, Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
Britt's worst infraction was that she was behind on her savings plan of setting 
aside $300 a month. Another complaint -- that she didn't sign in her visitors 
-- she blames on the unavailability of the sign-in sheet, which was locked up 
in the manager's trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Henderson, the Salvation Army executive in charge of the trailer program, 
denies that the on-site manager behaved inappropriately toward Britt. The 
"fairly strict" rules are essential for security and to ensure the program's 
success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army's Philosophy 
</P>
<P>
Gary Squier, director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority, said the Salvation 
Army's philosophy has succeeded in homeless shelters and alcohol abuse 
programs. "Frankly, I think the most rigid (programs) have a greater success 
rate in placements," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
For homeless people, Henderson said, "there is a frame of mind they need to 
reacquire -- a life style they have to reacquire. I think that would be better 
accomplished living within the rules of the program, just like they will have 
to do in society." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Britt is "creating her own war," said the on-site manager, Terri 
Murphy. Murphy described Britt as angry, confrontational and disruptive to the 
other families. "She hates people telling her what to do. She feels like she's 
an adult and can have visitors over whenever she wants." 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether Britt was behaving antagonistically and flouting the 
rules or whether the manager had been arbitrary and overly intrusive, or some 
combination of the two, is not easily answered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Program-Client' Relationship 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army contends that, because it has the same "program-client" 
relationship with trailer occupants as it has with overnight shelter users, it 
is entitled to unilaterally remove Britt, or any trailer occupant, if the 
residents break a rule they have agreed to follow. That position is shared by 
other agencies that run the decentralized trailer parks. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer resident was expected to go gently into that good night without 
benefit of legal proceedings or a hearing on the fairness of the eviction, said 
a Los Angeles housing official, adding that 34 occupants citywide have been 
"negatively terminated" from the program. 
</P>
<P>
Britt was not about to comply. She marshaled the same moxie that pulled her 
through cancer, diagnosed by her doctor as terminal in 1985. The illness 
triggered her family's declining circumstances, she said. Now she is in 
remission. 
</P>
<P>
She also refused to believe that being homeless meant she had forfeited her 
constitutional right to due process. "I told them I had worked hard to get this 
far. 'Don't do things to put me out on the curb,' " Britt, 39, said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid Foundation attorneys, who, since the inception of the program, have 
said trailer occupants are entitled to full tenants' rights, including an 
unlawful detainer hearing in court before being evicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Like Second Grade' 
</P>
<P>
Although generally enthusiastic about the trailer program, Legal Aid attorney 
Roderick Field said he found some on-site managers "pretty arbitrary and 
paternalistic. . . . It's like second grade. I've heard of jails that are a 
little looser." 
</P>
<P>
Some service organizations, said Legal Aid attorney Mary Lou Villar, have set 
up the trailer programs as a "dictatorship" that capitalizes on homeless 
people's fears, threatening them with being put back out on the streets at the 
slightest provocation. "They don't lose all their human rights they have as 
human beings to dignity," she claims. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the West Los Angeles program provides a plethora of amenities, 
including "a very nice trailer in a very nice part of town," counseling, child 
care, camp and trips to Disneyland for the children. "If you were homeless and 
in need of a place to live that badly, I don't think we ask anything 
unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
The program does not take advantage of the desperate straits of the homeless, 
who will likely agree to almost anything in exchange for six months of shelter, 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks a Middle Ground 
</P>
<P>
Susan Flores, director of human resources for Los Angeles' Community 
Development Department, said she seeks a middle ground for a program that has 
been, in large part, a success; 116 families have gone on to permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
She attributes the problems to the program's newness. For example, some 
providers used the same regulations they used in the much more communal 
atmosphere of temporary shelters, which require closer monitoring than might be 
needed in single-family dwellings, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said her department is studying the rules at all the trailer sites and 
intends to standardize guidelines within a month. "The questions are, first, 
are the rules appropriate? and, if they are appropriate, what happens if you 
break the rules?" she said. "We don't want people equating using drugs with 
knocking on the manager's door at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the program can be rigorous, without being overbearing, with the 
responsibility for success -- or failure -- resting with the individual, Flores 
said. Those who enter the trailer program must understand that their living 
quarters are a fringe benefit available only if they uphold their part of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Word 
</P>
<P>
Legislation may provide the last word as to whether the homeless have tenant 
rights if they live in trailers. Assistant City Atty. Julie Downey said the 
trailer parks are hybrids that don't fit into a clearly defined legal category. 
Somewhere between unceremonious ouster and interminable eviction hearings, 
there is a middle ground, she said. 
</P>
<P>
(Downey said she -- and others -- had hoped to tiptoe around the legal quandary 
while the trailer program was in its infancy.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Downey and Flores said that for now, trailer occupants will be 
afforded full tenant rights. The decision coincided with Britt's eviction flap, 
a situation that both women insist is not indicative of the program at large. 
</P>
<P>
However, Henderson said the Salvation Army has not conceded its legal position, 
nor will it accede to rules with which it does not agree. "The Salvation Army 
is going to want to have some say in how they run a program. It's their name 
and reputation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overlook the Matter' 
</P>
<P>
As for Britt, Henderson said they have decided "to overlook the matter and let 
her stay until the original length of her term." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said she tries to steer clear of Britt, who continues to break the rules 
by having overnight guests and refusing to register her visitors. "She's still 
here. She should be grateful," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus when Mayor Bradley honored those who had contributed time, money and 
energy to his pet project in a ceremony at the West Los Angeles trailer park 
Thursday, Britt still had a home.

DIRECTOR BLAKE EDWARDS DISPLAYS A BRONZE TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps best known as the creator of "Victor/Victoria" and the Pink Panther 
movies, film maker Blake Edwards is also a sculptor. Two of his larger bronzes 
-- "Reclining Figure" and "Interlocking" -- are now on display in the courtyard 
between the Century Plaza Towers, part of the Third Sculpture Walk produced by 
the Los Angeles Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 67, is the first to admit that his fame as a director has boosted his 
recent success as a sculptor. "I'm selling a lot," said Edwards, interviewed in 
his bungalow at Culver Studios, which, legend has it, was Vivien Leigh's 
dressing room during the shooting of "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not foolish enough to believe it's all because it's good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards knows there are some people who are interested in his work only because 
he is "Blake Edwards-the-director-turned-sculptor." But, Edwards said, he 
ultimately decided that that was no reason to stop sculpting or not to show his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is acutely aware, however, of how much easier he has it than poor, 
unknown artists. "I can afford to fail all over the place," he said, "and a lot 
of great talents can't." With its sometimes staggering foundry costs, metal 
sculpture is one of the dearest arts. "I don't know how poor, talented 
sculptors manage if they aren't discovered rather quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong painter ("I'm in the midst of a frantic watercolor thing"), Edwards 
did his first sculpture -- a small abstract form he still has -- 20 years ago. 
His wife, Julie Andrews, was one of his first fans. 
</P>
<P>
"She really thinks I'm talented. She likes what I do, and she thinks it should 
be shown," he said. "I have a wonderful cop-out. It's not me. It's my old lady 
who is doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his wife paints or sculpts, Edwards said, "No. She sings." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Edwards has painted in one of the bathrooms of his Malibu home 
(where the floor is impervious to art) and sculpted in the tool shed. He will 
soon move into a full-fledged art studio on the property. The new studio, built 
on a bluff, "looks almost like a wing in flight," he said. "It was expensive," 
he acknowledged, "but not crazy rich-man's expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Self-taught, Edwards said the single greatest influence on his sculpture was 
British artist Henry Moore. The director recalls shooting a TV special that 
used Moore's sculpture-strewn English estate as a backdrop and being fascinated 
by the scale and complexity of Moore's huge forms. "His work was 
three-dimensional, and film is not," Edwards said. "It excited me that it 
confounded me. It excited me that I couldn't get a handle on it." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards speculates that "if there is any connection between directing and 
sculpting, it would be angles." 
</P>
<P>
The film maker said he finds sculpting "very therapeutic." If the arts were 
drugs, he said, sculpting would be a tranquilizer. "I can get enormous relief 
emotionally from working with that clay." Painting, he said, "is joyful, but I 
can still get a tight gut from it." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Edwards' paintings and sculptures have been well received by critics. 
Should the critics turn, he said, his skin has been thickened by the scathing 
reviews some of his films have received. "I don't like it, but I can handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Century City exhibit, which continues through January, also includes 
sculptural works by Gilad Ben Artzi, Betty Gold, Baile Oakes and Charna Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said he "felt very honored" to be included. "I love that my stuff is 
outside, and people can walk around and see it," he said. But, he added, "the 
doing is what gives me the greatest pleasure."

CAT SLAYINGS ALARM W. HOLLYWOOD PET OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mildred Maiorino had just returned from a family outing last November when a 
neighbor came over with the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Her pet cat -- a 2-year-old, part-Siamese she had rescued from the streets of 
West Hollywood as a kitten and named Squeeky -- had been found dead on a 
neighbor's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Its body was cut neatly in half, as if sliced by a surgical knife," recalls 
Maiorino, her voice cracking with anger. "Only a fiend would do something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, authorities say, the carcasses of eight other pet felines have been 
found in roughly the same area of West Hollywood, between Fairfax and La Brea 
avenues on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cats were mutilated, and a few had their hearts and other organs 
removed, said Sgt. Finn Petersen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department.

After performing necropsies on two of the animals, a county veterinarian 
concluded that the deaths were probably the work of a coyote or other animal 
predator. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, by Dr. G. H. Ford, were apparently enough to convince sheriff's 
investigators -- who had explored the possibility that the killings might be 
related to a satanic cult -- that they were not dealing with a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've turned up no evidence to suggest that some crazed person is going around 
killing these cats," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 10 months since the killings began to attract public attention, 
alarmed pet owners and others in West Hollywood who suspect that the acts are 
the work of humans have not been convinced otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
After the City Council recently voted to offer a $2,500 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible, the debate 
appears to have intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Pet owners and animal rights advocates quickly praised the reward as holding 
out a possible breakthrough in solving the killings, saying it reaffirms their 
long-held suspicions that humans are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I never bought the idea of a coyote doing the killings for a minute," said 
Barbara Hameker, a magazine writer whose pet cat was found mutilated in a 
neighbor's yard in May. 
</P>
<P>
"The manner in which my cat died, the precision of the cuts beneath the neck 
and down the body, always told me that this wasn't the work of an animal, at 
least not the four-legged kind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Koretz sponsored a resolution in July declaring West Hollywood 
a "cruelty-free zone" for animals and suggested the reward. He said it 
"provides a chance to pry loose some information, if the killings are the work 
of humans and there is anyone out there who knows anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeps Open Mind 
</P>
<P>
Koretz described himself as having an open mind on the matter, but added, "I 
think you have to face the fact that, regardless of what the (Sheriff's 
Department) investigation has turned up, a lot of people believe that someone 
out there is killing these cats." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ford, the county veterinarian, criticized the reward as "an 
ill-advised idea" that "serves only to elicit paranoia on the part of cat 
owners and others when there is no evidence to suggest these are anything but 
predator-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"These things tend to get blown out of proportion," he said. "I've seen it 
happen in Montana when I worked there, and most recently, we've seen it happen 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread speculation that satanists were responsible for the deaths 
of 67 cats in Orange County during June and July -- 36 of them in the city of 
Tustin -- federal wildlife officials have concluded that the killings were the 
work of animal predators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood's Coyotes 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies say that it is not uncommon to spot coyotes in densely 
populated West Hollywood after dark. 
</P>
<P>
"They come down out of the hills looking for water and food. You see them 
roaming from time to time," said Rod Shanks, who investigated several of the 
West Hollywood incidents. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in each of the incidents, the cats appeared to have been killed 
during the night, and that their remains were usually found on yards and 
driveways. 
</P>
<P>
The first two deaths were reported last November, with the others occurring at 
irregular intervals since then, the latest in July, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any patterns," Shanks said. "We even consulted an expert in the 
occult to try and determine if the dates the cats were killed had any 
significance, but there was nothing."

ZEN MASTER GUIDES OTHERS ON ELUSIVE PATH TO TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of searching goes on out there, Grasshopper. But truth can sneak up on 
you when you least expect it. 
</P>
<P>
Joshu Sasaki, the Mt. Baldy Zen Center's 82-year-old Roshi, or Zen Master, 
rarely talks to outsiders nowadays. Mostly, the venerable spiritual leader 
spends his days in his little wood-slat cabin in the mountain, meditating and 
teaching his students and acolytes according to the oblique methods of Zen 
Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no predicting the Roshi. His students, in the monastery-like 
compound over which Sasaki presides, a former Boy Scout camp on the shoulder of 
the San Gabriel Mountains' highest peak, are often baffled by the master. 
</P>
<P>
"He's difficult to understand sometimes," said one elderly monk during a rare 
idle moment at the Zen center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Roshi has agreed to meet an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Apprehension 
</P>
<P>
This makes administrative director Koyo, who reluctantly leads the visitor 
along a path past towering Douglas firs to the Roshi's cabin, a little 
apprehensive. "I don't know how much you've prepared for this," says Koyo, 42, 
formerly Charles Engennach of Trenton, N.J., "but he probably won't answer a 
lot of academic questions on the nature of Buddhism." 
</P>
<P>
Then Koyo shrugs. "But I don't want to predict what the Roshi will or will not 
say," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Academically speaking, Zen is a school of Buddhism dating back to the 12th 
Century, when Japanese masters adapted Indian and Chinese meditation techniques 
and moral discipline in the search for transcendental illumination. From the 
Zen perspective, true wisdom is rarely straightforward or capable of being 
expressed objectively. 
</P>
<P>
The serious student seeks to escape "the eternal donkey hitching post" of 
objective language, as one Zen saying puts it, to a transcendental truth which 
can only be expressed in poetry or paradoxical riddles called koans. (Probably 
the most often-repeated koan in the Western world: "What is the sound of one 
hand clapping?") 
</P>
<P>
Sasaki came from Japan to Mt. Baldy 27 years ago, at the beginning of a wave of 
American interest in Zen Buddhism. College students were studying Alan Watts' 
books on Zen, the "beat" writers were waxing freely about Dharma (the sum of 
Buddhist truth), zazen (the Zen form of meditation) and other exotic ideas, and 
the first Japanese teachers were arriving in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, it was come one, come all, and all of us hippies came 
bouncing through the door," said Koyo, a tall, angular man, with his head 
shaved and his body wrapped in a black robe. "There was revolution in the air, 
you know?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fading by Mid-1970s 
</P>
<P>
Not the sort of bedrock on which to build a movement. By the mid-1970s, despite 
the popularity of a television "Kung Fu" character, who spouted ageless 
Zen-like profundities in the American West, Zen was fading into a broad 
American panorama of cults, churches and pop philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Those early students, intrigued by Zen thought's challenge to rational thought, 
weren't known for their longevity in the discipline, said Koyo, who has been 
studying Zen since 1971. "Most people get involved for a couple of years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Zen tide of the 1960s left behind some lasting institutions dedicated 
to the promotion of Zen thought. One of these was Rinzai-Ji, a Los 
Angeles-based national organization, the parent body of the Mt. Baldy center. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain center's faded red, wooden buildings seem to have been sprinkled 
randomly in a hollow 6,000 feet up the mountain, high above the smog line. 
There's a large meditation hall, an eating hall, an office, several dormitories 
and, on a knoll overlooking the camp, the Roshi's cabin. 
</P>
<P>
With its tree-lined vistas and blue skies, the place produces a feeling of 
almost palpable tranquility, outsiders often note. "Walk through the compound 
and you wonder sometimes if anyone's there," said George Duffy, a Forest 
Service Officer from the Mt. Baldy district, who frequently patrols the road 
past the Zen center. "They do maintain a real peaceful setting there, with a 
sense of some kind of higher association with the world, like going to a 
convent or a religious shrine." 
</P>
<P>
But there is hard work going on there, too, under a system of rigorous 
discipline. The Roshi's students -- there are 23 of them, including monks 
engaged in long-term studies and uninitiated novices who are here for the 
summer -- get up every morning at 3. Their day is filled with tasks (such as 
building a retaining wall, putting a new roof on the shower house or cooking), 
meditation, one-on-one brainstorming with their master and silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Banter, chatting, wondering what's going to happen tomorrow -- that's all 
considered a distraction from the reality that's being expressed," Koyo said. 
Bedtime is at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otherworldly Realms 
</P>
<P>
Koyo shows you the main meditation hall, a long unadorned room, with benches 
along the walls and cushions on which students perch in the cross-legged lotus 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In meditation it is easy to "drift into otherworldly kinds of realms," said 
Koyo. The meditation leader, a senior member of the group, sometimes polices 
the hall with a long, flat stick with which he brings dreamers and fidgeters 
back to the task at hand. Transgressions are met with stinging whacks with the 
stick, or keisaka, on the muscle of each shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Meditation, a way of heightening awareness, is central to Zen. "It's not 
thought," Koyo said. "In some ways, thought interferes with meditation. You 
need to direct it into its deeper expressions." Ideally, he adds, the awareness 
that comes from meditation carries over to other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, the center holds weeklong sesshins, or retreats, when students 
spend hours at a time in meditation. The mid-year sesshin has recently ended. 
"Don't you notice my glow?" Koyo said. 
</P>
<P>
A monk knocks two wooden blocks together, summoning the students for a short 
pre-luncheon meditation. They meditate for 10 minutes, then walk single file, 
wordlessly, to the dining hall, where they eat a meal of mashed potatoes (with 
margarine) and lettuce-and-radish salad. 
</P>
<P>
After the meal, several have time to speak to the visitor. One introduces 
himself as Dogo, a former teamster and welterweight boxer from New York. What 
brought him to the Zen Center? "It's a big, long, sloppy story," said Dogo, 63, 
who was known in his earlier life as Pat Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
"After I quit boxing (in 1948), everything sort of went sour," said Dogo, a 
bespectacled man who squints in the sun like someone who has just awakened from 
a refreshing sleep. "I started using drugs, my wife got in trouble over me and 
she left me alone with the baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruitless Psychoanalysis 
</P>
<P>
After three years of fruitless psychoanalysis, Dogo read a book by the Zen 
interpreter Shunryu Suzuki and looked up "Zen" in the Manhattan telephone book. 
He wound up at the Zen Institute in New York in 1967. He has been at the Mt. 
Baldy center for three years, where Roshi Sasaki has brought him contentment, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a chance to earn $1 million in gold coins every day," Dogo said 
with twinkling eyes. "But I'm talking too much about myself. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What koan is he meditating on now? Dogo hold his eyes shut tight, as if to make 
sure he gets it right. "How do I realize my family 2,700 miles away?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's meeting room is a small sitting area with a table and four 
mismatched chairs. Zen writers have referred to meetings with Zen masters as 
entering the lion's den, because of the vigorous exchanges they inspire with 
their students. But Roshi Sasaki, a small, sunny man who smiles hospitably, is 
far from leonine. 
</P>
<P>
He jokes good-naturedly about his age. "Eating is difficult," he says, speaking 
a thickly accented English. "Sometimes the fork falls down." He says he sleeps 
from three to seven hours a day. "But meditation is a good resting position," 
he said. His students, most of them white Americans, are very serious about 
their studies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Where does one begin to learn Zen? "Breathing," he said enigmatically. Pressed 
to talk about deeper issues, Sasaki speaks at length about the paradox of the 
duality of life. (A traditional saying puts it like this: "One moon shows in 
every pool; in every pool the one moon.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'True Love' 
</P>
<P>
"Real God is God nobody knows," Sasaki said. "Father not real father, mother 
not real mother. Real parent is one." He hold his two hands up, then clasps 
them in front of his face. "Father, mother completely become one. It is true 
love. Everything is my brother." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, he said, is "beyond subject and object, beyond knowing and 
expression." How do humans transcend reality? "Practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Roshi's accent is impenetrable, with extra syllables rolling out, 
like stones falling from an overloaded truck. His voice rises and fades. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no objective human," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, an amused Koyo said the Roshi often intentionally mumbles and 
mispronounces. "There's a lot going on that he's interested in besides just the 
words," said Koyo. "The most poignant moments in our lives are often silent." 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's way of talking -- is it a strategy to inspire the student to think 
harder? 
</P>
<P>
Koyo smiles craftily. "What do you think?" he said.

SUMMER COURSE BROADENS HORIZONS OF COLLEGE FRESHMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNELL ALEXANDER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This summer has shown Elizabeth Grounds that her hometown of Barstow, although 
only 120 miles from Los Angeles, seems as far away as a distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
The 20,600 or so inhabitants of her hometown are predominantly white and when 
Grounds, a 17-year-old college freshman, got A's all through Barstow High, she 
did it largely without thinking about people of other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
She had never known any black people. In fact, she had misgivings about even 
approaching them. 
</P>
<P>
Now while taking part in Occidental College's Multi-Cultural Summer Institute 
for incoming freshmen, she's not just approaching blacks, she's attending 
classes with them as well as with Latinos and Asians. She's surprised at what 
she's finding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we're the minority," she said. "It's a different feeling, and it's a 
good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Made up of under-represented minorities and whites from rural backgrounds, the 
summer institute combines writing and American culture courses with workshops 
and field trips for 36 students from around the country who have been accepted 
to the small private university. Students earn credit for the course work. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program, which was first proposed in the early 1980s by 
Occidental's minority caucus, is to acclimate students from diverse backgrounds 
to being on campus and in dorm rooms together. The first summer institute was 
conducted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen who come from rural Alaska and Arkansas and the inner cities of 
Baltimore and Philadelphia are spending five weeks together in classrooms and 
dorms, picking up information in class and out. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them have never even shared a room before, much less shared a room 
with someone who's different than them," said David Morgan, Occidental's 
associate director of admissions and co-director of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Behavioral scientist Ann Schell, an Occidental College faculty member, is 
studying the institute's effectiveness. In her study, she is comparing the 
college performances of past institute participants to those of Occidental 
students who were invited to take part in the institute but did not. 
</P>
<P>
Early and unofficial results indicate that the students who attended the summer 
institute are less likely to drop out of college than those who did not, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that the program may work is that it teaches students to balance 
work and play. The teen-agers are expected to participate in a full slate of 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, students arose early to ride to Tujunga and view its half-mile-long 
historical mural of California. Most of the sleepy students took with them a 
copy of a Flannery O'Connor short story to be discussed in an afternoon class, 
notes on an upcoming lecture or both. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard because it's academically intense, and you're supposed to be social 
at the same time," said Sonya Ramirez, a San Fernando High School graduate. 
</P>
<P>
It takes students time to adjust to the differences between high school and 
college academic work, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
"They hear that it's demanding and hard," said Manuel Pastor, one of three 
teachers of the culture course. "But they have no idea what that means." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important lessons the program has to offer are learned after 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before the chain-link fence separating the students from the mural's 
depiction of scientist Charles Drew in a lab, Kristie Robinson, a black student 
from Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, talked about race relations. 
While she spoke, Elizabeth Grounds, her new friend from Barstow, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were saying there were no blacks in their hometown," said 
Robinson, 18. "I could tell (that)." 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of change in myself," Grounds said, gesturing to Robinson. "Like 
Kristie. Kristie is one of my closest friends. And I never had any black 
friends before." 
</P>
<P>
Kristie rolled her eyes. "I'm a novelty," she said half in jest. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had preconceptions in the past," Grounds said. "And now I see them 
crumbling away."

OFFICIALS HEAP PRAISE ON 12-YEAR-OLD HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though he has been interviewed by television reporters, congratulated by 
friends and honored by Cudahy officials, 12-year-old James Lewis has not gotten 
used to being hailed as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird," said Lewis, who is more comfortable riding his bicycle or playing 
basketball with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrust into the limelight in May when he snuffed out flames that 
threatened the lives of two boys who had been set on fire accidentally. Another 
youth playing with gasoline in the parking lot of the Atlantis Motel, where all 
three lived, caused the fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standing Ovation 
</P>
<P>
The Cudahy City Council recently awarded Lewis a commendation. More than 150 
people gave him a standing ovation during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' commendation is believed to be the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy has "given awards to police officers, but this is probably the first 
citizen," City Clerk Ebbie Mouton said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Lewis also received an Heroic Action Award from officials in nearby 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was described as "an outstanding future leader" of Bell and Cudahy in the 
commendation presented to him by Bell city officials and Police Chief Manuel E. 
Ortega of the Bell-Cudahy Police Department, which provides police services to 
both cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Visited His School 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said two policemen who came to his school to tell him "You did a good 
deed," each gave him $5 and told him to buy "hamburger, fries and a Coke." 
</P>
<P>
The youth passed up the food and purchased a T-shirt and some shorts with the 
$10. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a student at Nimitz Junior High School in Huntington Park, lives at the 
low-rent Atlantis Motel with his parents, Helen Acuna and James Lewis Sr., and 
four other sisters and brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was in the motel's parking lot on May 15 when a 14-year-old youth lit a 
match near gasoline that he had poured onto the asphalt, police said. The 
flames leaped around the two children who were playing there. Lewis beat out 
the fire with his bare hands and threw Raul Silav, 10, to the ground, 
smothering the fire in the boy's clothing. He then pulled a burning jacket off 
Phil Kowal Jr., 6. Kowal received first- and second-degree burns on his face, 
neck and left arm. Silav and Kowal have since moved out of the motel. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old, who police declined to identify, was arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon but was later released. The 
fire was determined to be an accident, police Cmdr. Steve Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ortega said of Lewis: "His quick, courageous action certainly 
reduced the injury to the 6-year-old, and very likely saved the lives of both 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
And why did Lewis do it? 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to see anyone burned," said Lewis, who wants to be a 
professional basketball player like his hero Byron Scott of the Los Angeles 
Lakers.

American men finished 1-2 in three of the final five events and Janet Evans

THE LAST DETAIL;

<P>
END OF NAVY HITCH IS ON THE HORIZON FOR SAN ANTONIO SPURS' DAVID ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LE BATARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his head to his high tops, David Robinson is unique. 
</P>
<P>
Unique because the former All-American center at Navy will collect $26 million 
from the San Antonio Spurs over the next eight years, the third-highest salary 
in basketball history, but he nonetheless continues to make collect phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Unique because he spends his free time studying theology and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Unique because his most pressing concern today isn't whether he will develop a 
stronger post-up game but whether he will ever learn to improvise on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to spruce up the music, go from sharps to flats instinctively," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So, for all the uniqueness that Robinson packs into his 7-foot, 226-pound body, 
one figures he would be spoiled by the Navy while serving his two-year, 
postgraduation commitment. One figures he would be coddled by the Spurs while 
learning pro basketball at his own pace. 
</P>
<P>
One figures wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Very soon, David Robinson will get back to what he does best, if not most often 
-- playing basketball. And he says he will do it better than ever because of 
what he has endured over the last 23 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely got special treatment in the Navy, but not the way you are 
thinking," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They would really go out of their way to make things more difficult for me 
just so that people would know that I wasn't special, that everyone was equal. 
It really isn't fair, but fair isn't really a word they use much there." 
</P>
<P>
An example: Before his active-duty commitment began, Robinson submitted 15 
places where he would like to be stationed, places he said would have been most 
conducive to his basketball training. That wasn't at all unusual. In fact, most 
ensigns submit a similar list and the Navy usually tries to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the Navy didn't try all that hard in his case. 
</P>
<P>
He was eventually sent to St. Mary's, Ga., "a one-road town" where he spent 13 
of his 23 months. The 10 other months were spent either preparing for or 
playing in the All-Navy Games, the Pan American Games or the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never been to Georgia," Robinson said, adding that St. Mary's was 
neither on his list nor his mind. "I didn't even want to go." 
</P>
<P>
So much for preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson emphasizes that his hitch in the Navy was enjoyable, even though the 
locale forced him to work out alone. He said he learned a lot working nine-hour 
days as a civil engineer, and that working out by himself increased his stamina 
as well as his will. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best lessons I learned over the last two years is how to motivate 
myself," he said. "I couldn't train by myself before. I could train, but not by 
taking myself all the way to the next level, until I was numb." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's official title was assistant resident officer in charge of 
construction and among his duties was, perhaps fittingly, negotiating 
contracts. The main thrust of his work, though, included supervision of 
waterfront construction and electrical distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fun," Robinson said. "They put me to work. We went through giant mounds 
of paper work, making sure the bidders had safety plans, environmental plans, 
insurance plans. There were always papers to write and reports to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a challenge, but I love challenges, no matter what they are. 
I always want to expand my horizons and that's how I approach basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Now Robinson moves on to a greater challenge. His employer is no longer the 
U.S. government, but the Spurs. His commander now is Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, Coach Brown is always on me," Robinson said. "You can go out and score 40 
points and he'll be furious about 1,000 other things. A lot of people can't 
understand someone yelling at them all the time, but I need that. I don't need 
someone to pat me on the back." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Bob Bass, the Spurs' director of player personnel, will do the 
back-patting. After seeing Robinson at a Spur rookie camp and a summer league 
at at Loyola Marymount, Bass did nothing but rave about Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a guy with that speed and quickness at that size," Bass said. 
"I don't know who to compare him to because there is nobody like him. He's like 
a forward, but he blocks shots and rebounds so well that we can't move him too 
far away from the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was especially impressive in the pro league, which featured several 
NBA players. The Spurs left the league after five games because Robinson had 
already shown them everything they needed to see. He scored 36 points the night 
the Spurs decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he averaged 25.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.2 blocks, playing only 
about 25 minutes a game. His rebounding average was disappointing on paper, but 
Robinson isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebounding was a secondary thing," he said. "I already know I can do that, so 
I didn't focus on it. I concentrated on running the floor and posting up. I 
know when I concentrate on rebounding that I'll get 15 a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to bring my whole game around. I don't want to be just another 
rebounder because I have the potential to be much, much better than that. I'm a 
good player right now, but if I approach the game as if there is always 
something to learn, I can always keep climbing."

MICHIGAN RATED NO. 1 IN FIRST POLL OF SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan's football team is picking up where Michigan's basketball team left 
off -- No. 1 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Five months after winning the national basketball championship, the Wolverines 
are the nation's top college football team in the Associated Press' Top 25 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan received 23 first-place votes and 1,439 points to edge defending 
national champion Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish, who will play at Ann Arbor on 
Sept. 16, were ranked No. 1 on 20 ballots and received 1,378 points. 
</P>
<P>
The only other teams receiving first-place votes were Nebraska (10), Miami (4), 
USC (1) and Florida State (2). 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska is ranked third, followed by Miami, USC, Florida State, Louisiana 
State, Auburn, UCLA and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Michigan's top three quarterbacks were recently declared ineligible, but 
the Wolverines still have senior Michael Taylor, who started the first nine 
games last season before suffering a broken collarbone.

USC'S O'HARA SIDELINED FOR SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
MARINOVICH WILL START AT QUARTERBACK AGAINST ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
USC quarterback Pat O'Hara's season officially ended Saturday in an operating 
room at Pasadena's Huntington Memorial Hospital when doctors found extensive 
damage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Inadvertently hit by onrushing lineman J.P. Sullivan during a scrimmage Friday 
at UC Irvine, O'Hara not only wound up with two torn ligaments in the knee, but 
a broken shin as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Diehl, who performed the surgery, was optimistic that O'Hara, a 
junior, will be able to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
After spending three years as understudy to Rodney Peete, O'Hara appeared to 
have won his battle with freshman Todd Marinovich for the No. 1 job. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich will start the Sept. 4 season opener at the Coliseum against 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick to my stomach watching them take him off the field," Marinovich 
said. "I'm going to pray for him every night. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't change what happened. All I can do is seize the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Seven days earlier, starting nose guard Don Gibson suffered a knee injury that 
will sideline him for five to seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been really spoiled the last couple of years as far as injuries," 
defensive lineman Tim Ryan said. "We've now lost two key guys in fall camp. 
We're not used to that. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was a weird atmosphere at Friday's scrimmage, even before the 
injury. Everybody seemed lethargic. I wasn't surprised when it happened. There 
has been weird karma going around. It didn't feel good. 
</P>
<P>
"But when it happened, people didn't think, 'There goes our quarterback.' We 
thought about Pat, a guy who had worked so hard. It just hurts my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Said running back Aaron Emanuel: "It's almost like we're in the Twilight Zone. 
When I saw him (O'Hara) go down, everything felt real cold. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a guy lying there on the ground screaming, you're thinking, Lord, 
let it be just a bruise. When you hear how bad it is, it just tears you up. 
Here's a guy who was so patient, waited his turn and never complained. It 
really doesn't seem fair. I hurt for the guy."

ARIZONA STATE NEXT STOP FOR JUNIOR CHAMPION BRANDIE BURTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brandie Burton won all there was to win in national junior girls' golf this 
summer and very nearly did the same on the women's tour. Now she is turning her 
attention to college golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Rialto girl, the Junior World and United States Junior Girls' champion, 
will enroll Monday at Arizona State but she won't have to wait long before 
resuming her golfing career. The Sun Devils open the collegiate season Sept. 25 
in the University of Oregon Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, who won't be 18 until January, also reached the finals of the U.S. 
Women's Amateur and the Women's Trans-National tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"She came about as close to a grand slam as she could get without getting it," 
said her mother, Barbara. "Every year she seems to outdo herself." 
</P>
<P>
She certainly outdid not only herself but everyone else on the junior circuit 
when it came to driving the ball. In all of her matches Brandie, who stands 
5-feet-7 and weighs 165 pounds, out-drove her opponents by at least 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"When I really crank one, I hit it about 260 yards," she said. "I used to take 
distance seriously, but now I'm more concerned with hitting it in the fairway 
than I am with how far it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Her strength, Burton believes, comes from her early training as a swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I swam the breaststroke for seven years, from the time I was 4 until I was 11, 
and that really built up my legs and shoulders, and that's what you need to hit 
the ball a long way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An all-around athlete, Burton was a Junior Olympian in swimming, an all-star 
catcher in softball and turned down an opportunity to train for a career in 
tennis to concentrate on golf. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a natural in every sport she tried," her mother says. "She loved every 
one of them and the best thing about it is that she got good grades, too." 
</P>
<P>
Burton graduated from Eisenhower High with a 3.6 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
She started her final season of junior golf by winning a third Optimist Junior 
World title by seven strokes over Nicole Horner of Hawaii with a near-record 
291 over the 6,272-yard north course at Torrey Pines. She won the 13-14 age 
division in 1986 and the 15-17 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to go out on top," Brandie said after repeating as champion. 
</P>
<P>
Next was the U.S. Junior, where she became the first girl to win the medal 
three years in a row. Her 69-69 -- 138 at the Pine Needles course in Southern 
Pines, N.C., broke the tournament record by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Although she defeated Camie Hoshino of Hawaii, 1 up, in the final, Burton 
scored her big win in the semifinals when she defeated her longtime rival, 
Vickie Goetze of Hull, Ga., 1 up. The pair first met in the 1986 U.S. Junior, 
where Goetze won in a third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
Their match was so tense this year that Burton was three under par after five 
holes -- and was one down before asserting herself on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted that title so my name would be on the trophy with some of the 
players who had great careers later," Burton said, referring to champions such 
as Marlene Bauer Hagge, Mickey Wright, JoAnne Gunderson Carner, Hollis Stacy, 
Amy Alcott and Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Taylor, editor of Golf World magazine, called Burton "a combination of 
Gunderson and Lopez" after watching her in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Goetze got her revenge eight days later, however, when she turned the tables on 
Burton in the Amateur final at Pinehurst, N.C., winning, 4 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
The loss prevented Burton from becoming the first female to win the U.S. Junior 
and U.S. Amateur championships in the same year. Gunderson is the only one to 
have won them both and she accomplished it over two years. As did Burton, 
Gunderson also lost in the amateur final the year she won the junior title. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Trans-Nationals in Columbia, S.C., where Burton dominated play 
before losing to Karen Noble of Brookside, N.J., in the final, 5 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a pretty good month altogether," Brandie said. 
</P>
<P>
At Arizona State, she will move into the spot left by Pearl Sinn, who turned 
professional after four years of college. Sinn, who lives in Bellflower, won 
both the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Women's Public Links championships last year 
and repeated this year in the Public Links. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose Arizona State because it's a fabulous facility, it has a great 
tradition of golf and the team has a great coach in Linda Vollstedt," Burton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, her instructors have been her father, Roger, a Sunday golfer; Tim 
Miskell, professional at the Arrowhead Country Club in San Bernardino; and 
Cheryl Thomas, pro at the San Bernardino municipal course. 
</P>
<P>
She started playing while tagging along with her brother, Troy, when she was 8. 
Troy, 24, is an assistant pro at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
She was hitting balls at Walt Duda's driving range in Redlands when she caught 
the attention of Katie Castator, former golf writer for the San Bernardino Sun. 
When the Southern California Golf Assn. held a junior clinic at Fairmount Park 
in Riverside, Castator suggested that Burton, then 13, demonstrate how to hit 
the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I ever saw her and I was amazed," Miskell said. "It 
was obvious that she was oozing with talent. She was hitting it well over 200 
yards, remarkable for a little girl. I told her that if she needed any help, to 
call on me." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Finding it more and more difficult to get a starting time? The National Golf 
Foundation reports that the nation's golf population increased by 7.8% -- from 
21.7 to 23.4 million -- last year. The figures indicate that women are the 
biggest contributors to the increase. They make up about 22% of the golfers in 
the United States, yet 41% of all new golfers are women. . . . Women 
professionals of the LPGA will show their talents Sept. 21-24 at Los Coyotes CC 
in the $300,000 Nippon Travel-MBC (for Mainichi Broadcasting Systems) 
tournament. Openings are available for a women-only pro-am Sept. 18, and a 
celebrity pro-am Sept. 20. The charity events will help fund the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation and Childhelp U.S.A. Among the favorites will be Amy 
Alcott, who won a Lee Hamill Memorial junior tournament on the same course when 
she was 13. That was 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Two old favorites, Riviera and Los Angeles North, are included in Golf 
magazine's choice of the 100 best courses in the world. Riviera is ranked No. 
30 and L.A. North No. 35. In for the first time are two PGA West courses in La 
Quinta, the original Stadium monster, ranked No. 77, and the Jack Nicklaus 
private course, No. 90. As usual, two of the top four are the Monterey 
peninsula neighbors, Pebble Beach and Cypress Point. Pine Valley, N.J., is 
ranked No. 1. . . . The California Handicapped Skiers Foundation will be 
recipients of proceeds from the Arcadia Tournament of Roses celebrity 
tournament Monday at Santa Anita. Participants include Adrian Zmed, Jason 
Bateman, David Graf, Ellie Daniel and Judy Norton-Taylor. . . . Stan Funk 
defeated Dick Park, 1-up, for the championship of the Penmar men's club. . . . 
Leanne Ulmer of Shandin Hills shot 233 in winning the Southern California 
women's public links' 54-hole tournament at Rio Hondo. Dona Kogan of Knollwood 
finished second at 247. . . . Southland sectional qualifying for the U.S. 
Senior Amateur will be held Thursday at Horse Thief.

SMEARED PHOTO HELPS SCIENTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
ICY BOULDERS GIVE CLUE TO ODD NEPTUNE RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists studying photographs relayed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft have 
discovered huge icy boulders in a mysterious ring around Neptune, possibly 
providing a clue as to why the planet's outermost ring is so bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
The icy "moonlets" measure up to about 10 miles in diameter, far larger than 
the dust-like particles believed to make up the rest of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, they were found in an area that is much brighter and wider 
than the rest of the ring. Ground-based astronomers discovered that segment of 
the ring several years ago and concluded erroneously that they had found only 
partial rings, called ring arcs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clue in Photograph 
</P>
<P>
No one could explain then why any planet would have ring arcs because 
scientists could see no reason why ring particles would not be distributed 
fairly uniformly around the entire planet. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager scientists determined last week that Neptune's rings are complete, 
although the segments discovered by astronomers earlier were lumpy and highly 
irregular. That too has eluded explanation. 
</P>
<P>
That changed Saturday when scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
announced that a smeared photograph may provide the answer. For the Voyager, 
even when something goes wrong it seems to turn out right. 
</P>
<P>
A smeared photograph is the nemesis of any shutterbug, but one sent back by the 
intrepid 12-year-old robot caught the interest of the scientists, said Bradford 
Smith of the University of Arizona, leader of the Voyager's imaging team. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that when scientists looked at the image, they detected about six or 
eight bright spots that had been moving along the ring during the exposure and 
thus appeared as long lines. Camera movement, which smeared the image, also 
caused the lines to twist, resulting in what appeared to be a braided ring. 
</P>
<P>
The "braids" were in fact just bright spots that had to be clumps of matter 
large enough to show up as streaks, just like a distant star that also appeared 
in the image, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
That told the scientists that the ring contained "some embedded rocks," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The "rocks," which he said probably contain a lot of ice and might best be 
described as "moonlets," dominate the fatter segments of the ring. The narrow 
band of smaller particles extending the rest of the way around Neptune was 
discovered just before Voyager's closest approach last Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking to see if there's something that is different about this 
particular ring" that could explain why it is so inconsistent, Smith said. 
"This may be it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Two Rings 
</P>
<P>
Voyager data also revealed Saturday that Neptune is more than just a two-ring 
circus. Voyager images now show that the distant planet has up to five rings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the most recently discovered rings are so broad that their small 
particles are spread so thin they can just barely be seen, and all lie closer 
to the planet than the outermost ring that was confirmed last week. 
</P>
<P>
The broadest of the rings is many hundreds of miles in width and lies closest 
to Neptune, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the moonlets was only one of many developments Saturday at 
JPL, where scientists continue to revel in the immense amount of data that 
Voyager sent back to Earth in its grand finale as the unchallenged leader among 
planetary explorers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gravity Slows Voyager 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager is now nearly a million and a half miles beyond Neptune, speeding 
toward space at nearly 38,000 m.p.h. Its speed is less now because it is 
fighting Neptune's gravity instead of being pulled by it as it heads off toward 
its first encounter with another star. 
</P>
<P>
It is due to pass within about 25 trillion miles of Bernard's Star in the year 
8571. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, JPL scientists were entering the home stretch Saturday, comparing 
notes as they prepared to wrap up the "close phase" of the Neptune encounter 
this Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There are 11 scientific teams on the Voyager project, each concentrating on 
different disciplines ranging from the study of the "interplanetary medium" to 
the composition of Neptune's backward traveling moon, Triton. 
</P>
<P>
The planetary encounter provides a unique opportunity for experts in one field 
to compare their results with findings by colleagues in other disciplines. That 
cross-fertilization makes it possible for experts to engage in instant 
analysis, although not always with a great deal of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
For example, geologists on the imaging team were fascinated by features on the 
surface of Triton that appeared to have been shaped by winds, just as sand 
dunes in the desert are molded by the wind on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
For that to work, however, Triton would need a fairly dense atmosphere, and the 
geologists asked the project's atmospheric scientists if their data showed that 
Triton's atmosphere could be heavy enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We need (a dense atmosphere)," Smith said, "but they won't give it to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen in Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
So if some of the features on Triton's surface were in fact shaped by the wind, 
it must have been at some other time, in some other season, when the conditions 
on the moon's surface were different than they are today. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also determined that Triton's atmosphere has one of the 
components of Southern California's smog, nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery also required the assistance of a distant star. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sandel of the University of Arizona said it had not been possible for 
astronomers on Earth to determine all the constituents of Triton's atmosphere 
because they cannot separate the moon from its atmosphere when viewed from the 
Earth. So researchers have debated among themselves over the nature of Triton's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a controversy that has been with us for years," Sandel said. 
</P>
<P>
An ultraviolet spectrometer aboard the Voyager solved that problem by studying 
the light from a star as it was eclipsed by first the atmosphere and then the 
icy surface of Triton. Since different light frequencies are absorbed by 
different elements, the spectrometer could define the atmosphere's composition 
by detecting which frequencies were absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Data from that experiment shows that nitrogen dominates Triton's atmosphere, 
although there is some methane (natural gas) close to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also reported Saturday that Neptune's magnetic field is inclined at 
least 30 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation. On most planets, including 
Earth, the inclination is about 10 degrees, so Neptune's is odd but not as odd 
as Uranus', which is inclined 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Humble' Magnetosphere 
</P>
<P>
The magnetic field also creates an envelope around the planet, called the 
magnetosphere, which plays an important role in such things as the auroral 
activity that creates the northern and southern lights on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Tom Krimigis of Johns Hopkins University reported Saturday that 
"Neptune's magnetosphere is rather humble." 
</P>
<P>
That may be one reason Voyager scientists have not found conclusive evidence 
that the spacecraft detected northern lights when it passed within 3,000 miles 
of the clouds over Neptune's north pole.

NEW PANELS FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN REFORMS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bipartisan research group, charging Los Angeles area enforcement officials 
with neglect of campaign financing laws, has called for creation of independent 
commissions to clean up local politics in "a system drunk with cash." 
</P>
<P>
The California Commission on Campaign Financing proposed separate fair 
political practices commissions for Los Angeles County and for many of the 86 
cities within its boundaries. And, it said in a report made public today, the 
commissions should be given stronger contribution-regulation laws to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended limiting campaign contributions and 
expenditures and providing partial public financing of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Study in Extremes' 
</P>
<P>
In an overview, the study concluded, "Local elections in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area are a study in extremes. . . . A wide-ranging mixture of the 
exemplary and the excessive, the picture of money and politics in the Los 
Angeles area illustrates the best and the worst in local campaign financing." 
</P>
<P>
In some smaller cities, the commission said, candidates raise money from 
friends and neighbors, walk precincts, spend minimal amounts and personally 
meet many voters. 
</P>
<P>
"But in other Los Angeles area communities, candidates exhibit the worst 
excesses of a system drunk with cash," the report said. "They isolate 
themselves from the voters, rely on phalanxes of paid political advisers, raise 
contributions around the clock, accumulate huge war chests in non-election 
years, scare off challengers, solicit contributions from persons with financial 
interests pending before them, spend large sums on entertainment, fund raising 
and travel and communicate with the public through orchestrated media 
campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
The panel, composed mainly of business and legal leaders, compiled a 373-page 
report that says "enforcing campaign laws has not been a priority at any level 
of government." 
</P>
<P>
At present, local officials are in charge of implementing local laws. The 
state's political watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices Commission, 
moves against local officials only when they are suspected of violating state 
laws but is powerless to enforce local regulations. District attorneys, city 
attorneys and election officials -- those in charge of enforcing local campaign 
financing laws -- are reluctant to do so because mayors, city councils and the 
Board of Supervisors control their budgets and sometimes hire them, the study 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Same Elected Fraternity' 
</P>
<P>
And even when district and city attorneys are elected, and presumably 
independent, they are reluctant to enforce laws because they "are also 
politicians, subject to the same restrictions as council members or 
supervisors," the report said. "They all belong to the same elected 
fraternity." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the report criticized Los Angeles' elected city attorney, James 
K. Hahn, for being "reluctant" to enforce the city's campaign financing law, 
especially in the case of campaign finance law and conflict-of-interest 
violations by City Councilman Richard Alatorre. Hahn filed a civil suit against 
Alatorre only after the political watchdog group Common Cause threatened to go 
to court. Hahn's suit resulted in Alatorre paying the largest fine paid for 
such a violation in California history -- almost $150,000, which came from his 
campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he disagrees with the commission characterizing him as "reluctant." 
</P>
<P>
He said he first referred the Alatorre matter to Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner because 
he feared "a perception" of conflict, since the city attorney is legal adviser 
to the council. When Reiner did not take the case, Hahn said his office moved 
ahead with it. 
</P>
<P>
And the commission said Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez, appointed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley and confirmed by the City Council, delayed investigating 
allegations of violations against Councilman Robert Farrell and 
then-Councilwoman Pat Russell until the statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said his office was hampered in pursuing the two cases because of a 
shortage of auditors and because the statute of limitations for the offense was 
too short -- just one year. The commission recommended that the statute of 
limitations be extended for such offenses to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism of Hahn came as the city attorney is investigating 
conflict-of-interest allegations against the mayor. Some council members have 
questioned the intensity of Hahn's investigation of a man who has been an old 
political friend, although the city attorney has pledged a tough and impartial 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Criticized 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Los Angeles, the commission studied Agoura Hills, Gardena, 
Pasadena, Santa Monica, Signal Hill and West Covina, as well as Los Angeles 
County. It reserved some of its toughest words for the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere in California does campaign reform appear to be more necessary than in 
Los Angeles County. There is, however, little likelihood that the members of 
the board will change a campaign financing system that today gives them 
political power. Under the circumstances, a constituent-driven ballot 
initiative could be an alternative means of implementing campaign finance 
reform. Proponents of such an initiative would have to expect, however, that 
incumbent supervisors are likely to use their tremendous financial resources to 
oppose such reform." 
</P>
<P>
The commission said "one Los Angeles-based lobbyist who regularly appears 
before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles City 
Council told the commission 'if we did in the smaller cities what we do in the 
larger jurisdictions, the officials in the smaller cities would call it 
bribery.' " 
</P>
<P>
It added that "the flood of money from business interests to incumbent mayors, 
city council members and county supervisors has given many members of the 
public the impression that campaign contributions improperly influence votes. 
This perception is particularly prevalent concerning developer contributions 
and local land use decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County government was cited as an example of that sort of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The county has no laws governing campaign contributions, the report noted, 
although its officials are covered by state laws, including Proposition 73 -- 
which limits contributions and bans transferring funds from one candidate to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Dominance 
</P>
<P>
"Year-round fund raising and enormous campaign war chests have eliminated 
nearly all serious challenges to incumbents, resulting in incumbent dominance 
that protects supervisors from criticism and controversy," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Supervisors have the resources to spend tremendous sums of money during 
elections if necessary; when not challenged, they freely use those resources to 
build their political power bases, secure in the knowledge that their campaign 
coffers will be refilled when they next appear on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the commission criticized the big campaign treasury accumulated 
by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who has had no serious opposition. He uses the 
money to assist other campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In a reference to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), a master at 
raising money for candidates and causes favorable to him, the report said 
Schabarum, "seemingly playing the role of the Willie Brown of local 
politicians, has raised the practice of candidate transfers to highly 
sophisticated levels, using several political committees to redistribute 
thousands of dollars yearly to increase his political clout throughout the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum press aide Judy Hammond said the supervisor would not comment on the 
report until he had a chance to read it. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Kenneth Hahn, Deane Dana and Ed Edelman have also accumulated large 
sums of money despite little opposition, using it to help other candidates or 
to ward off challengers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich had to spend his sizable campaign funds in a 1988 
reelection campaign against challenger Baxter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Issue 
</P>
<P>
The report said that both supervisors and staff members insisted in interviews 
that the contributions -- most of them from business -- do not influence 
supervisorial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission said that contributors, insisting on anonymity, told the 
commission staff they fear that "they must make contributions if they want 
approval for ventures that may require clearance by the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
"Those involved in particularly lucrative projects look on their political 
contributions as an investment," the report said. "As one contributor 
explained, 'They (supervisors) can get you through the internal fiefdoms and 
infighting. This can save a developer an incredible amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
As examples of instances where campaign contributions helped, the report cited 
supervisorial approval of a huge proposed development started by the late 
Howard Hughes' Summa Corp. south of Marina del Rey and expansion of development 
in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In past news reports of those controversies, supervisors and their aides have 
denied contributor influence. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also blamed contributions to incumbents, and the one-sided 
politics produced by such a system, for low voter interest in no-contest races. 
</P>
<P>
"Fund raising and spending of this magnitude has suppressed electoral 
competition, enhanced the appearance of corruption and left many voters 
disinterested and apathetic," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loopholes in Law 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles city, the commission noted that voters had passed a strong 
campaign financing law, limiting contributions, in 1985, but "loopholes and 
other problems have compromised the law's effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the law has not prevented the influence of big 
business givers because of the practice known as "bundling." 
</P>
<P>
"Former large contributors can still solicit contributions from others and then 
convey them to the candidate in a 'bundle,' thereby retaining the appearance of 
special interest influence despite the new law," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that several employees of companies doing business with 
the city join in supporting a candidate, providing a bundle of money from a 
single company. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Clerk Martinez said he supports the recommendation to put 
enforcement of local laws into the hands of an independent commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for the city clerk to enforce these laws," he said. "The 
city clerks are put in a tough position when they have to fine council members. 
I fined a couple of council members and those kinds of things do not endear you 
to council members who determine your pay. It definitely impacted on me on my 
merit pay. . . . I would not miss being the enforcement officer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hahn Backs Idea 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Hahn also backed the idea of an independent commission. "The key is 
adequate staffing (for the commission)," Hahn said. "It is an expense. The 
taxpayers will not be thrilled. But it is an expense that has to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
The commission that completed the report was founded in 1984 to study and make 
recommendations on California's campaign financing system. This study was 
funded by the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's co-chairmen are Cornell Maier, retired chairman and chief executive 
officer of Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp.; Rocco Siciliano, retired 
chairman of Ticor, Los Angeles, and Francis Wheat, former commissioner of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The executive director is Tracy Westen and 
the co-director and general counsel is Robert M. Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members include former Rep. Clair W. Burgener, a member of the UC 
Board of Regents; former Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, chairman 
of the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers; Robert R. Dockson, 
chairman of California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn.; Walter B. Gerken, 
chairman of the executive committee of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.; 
former Caltech President Marvin L. Goldberger, director of the Institute for 
Advanced Study at Princeton University; Stafford R. Grady, retired chairman of 
Lloyds Bank of California; Neil E. Harlan, retired chairman of the McKesson 
Corp.; Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.; Aileen C. 
Hernandez, former member of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; 
Ivan J. Houston, chairman of Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Co.; Los 
Angeles attorney Michael Kantor; Stanford University President Donald Kennedy; 
Sunset magazine Publisher Melvin B. Lane; former Assembly Speaker Robert T. 
Monagan; Luis Nogales, former chairman of the Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund, Los Angeles; UCLA Law School dean Susan Westerberg 
Prager; retired California Supreme Court Justice Frank K. Richardson; William 
R. Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County 
Federation of Labor; Cal State Los Angeles President James M. Rosser; 
California Chamber of Commerce President Peter F. Scott; Jean R. Wente, 
chairman of Wente Bros. Winery, and former state Bar President Samuel L. 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes that Burgener, Hawley, Hernandez, Nogales, Richardson and 
Rosser joined the commission after the current study was substantially 
completed.

BALTIC LANDS GET SOVIET WARNING; 
</P>
<P>
PARTY LEADERS HINT AT CRACKDOWN OVER CAMPAIGNS FOR INDEPENDENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet leadership, in a warning that hinted at a crackdown in the Baltic 
republics, said Saturday that activists pressing for independence are leading 
the region into an abyss that could endanger its survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee declaration, read at the start of the main evening news 
broadcast on Soviet television, also lashed out at local party leadership in 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, saying that some officials had fostered links 
with extremists calling for a break from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
It was the clearest signal yet that the Communist Party leadership has decided 
to reverse its policy of permitting creeping freedoms in the Baltics and is now 
ready to set limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy of Tolerance 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's policy of tolerance toward the Baltic states, backed by President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, included allowing the region virtual economic 
independence and responding cautiously even in the face of declarations from 
the republics' parliaments that Soviet law is secondary to local law. 
</P>
<P>
The gambit, risky from the start, was intended to dissuade Balts from seeking 
to leave the union. 
</P>
<P>
But the tactic increasingly appears to be failing. Rhetoric has become more 
radical from the Baltic activists, who have called for an outright break with 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people in the Baltics have signed petitions demanding 
independence for their republics. 
</P>
<P>
The party declaration would not divert Baltic activists from the drive for 
independence, according to Ulo Kaevats of the Estonian People's Front. 
</P>
<P>
The message "won't have any particular effect because it doesn't include any 
concrete steps," the Associated Press quoted Kaevats as saying. "I see it as an 
expression of weakness and of a policy that is not very rational." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Russians living in the Baltics, complaining of discrimination, have 
responded to the independence drive with strikes and counter-movements. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have gone far. The fate of the Baltic peoples is in serious danger," 
the Central Committee said. "People should know into what abyss they are being 
pushed by their nationalist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The consequences could be disastrous for the people if the nationalists manage 
to attain their goals," the toughly worded statement continued. "The very 
viability of the Baltic nations could be called into question." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which called on all Balts "to realize the full extent and 
reality of the impending disaster," came just three days after up to 2 million 
people joined hands in a giant human chain across the Baltics. 
</P>
<P>
The joint demonstration was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of 
a Soviet-German nonaggression pact which led to the occupation of the 
then-independent Baltic states by Soviet Army troops. The republics were 
subsequently annexed by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet police did not interfere with the demonstrators, the Central 
Committee statement held out the possibility that in the future, protesters 
would meet a harsher response, particularly those seeking a break with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mass Street Clashes' 
</P>
<P>
It warned that a threat had arisen of "civil conflict and mass street clashes" 
that would "involve grave consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The statement clearly sought to isolate the nationalist leaders, saying: 
"Soviet people across the country watched and read with astonishment and 
bitterness about things that in no way agreed with what they knew of Latvian, 
Lithuanian and Estonian national traditions and would appear insulting to the 
national character of a people known for their honesty, sober-mindedness and 
respect for standards of civilized human relationship." 
</P>
<P>
It said the positions espoused by nationalist leaders have become "more and 
more openly extremist and separatist" and criticized "the anti-socialist, 
anti-Soviet nature of their schemes." 
</P>
<P>
The nationalist leaders, the declaration said, attempted on the anniversary of 
the Soviet-German pact to "fan emotions to a point of actual nationalist 
hysteria. Slogans foisted upon thousands of people were full of animosity 
toward the Soviet system, Russian people, the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union and the Soviet Army." 
</P>
<P>
Slogans on signs posted in the capitals of the Baltic republics last week 
included: "Down with Communism" and "Red Army Go Home." Nationalist groups sold 
buttons showing the Nazi swastika on the Soviet flag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Negative Tendencies' 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee statement also singled out Communist Party leaders in the 
republics, saying they had "failed to stem the negative tendencies, to redress 
the situation, to uphold principled positions. . . . Some even began to play up 
to nationalist sentiments." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party leadership in the Baltics, in fact, has become increasingly 
independent from Moscow. In Lithuania, for example, a party commission 
investigating the controversial Soviet-German pact of 1939 went further than a 
Soviet Parliament commission in denouncing the pact and argued that the 
situation in the Baltics should be returned to its 1939 conditions -- in other 
words, independence should be restored to the republics.

BOARDWALK RECALLS ERA WHEN LIFE WAS A BEACH

<P>
Santa Cruz's 85-year-old beach boardwalk is a time machine, a vintage warp. 
</P>
<P>
There are touches of another era like the three Marinis at the Beach candy 
shops. Owner Joe Marini Sr. has been making saltwater taffy for 68 years on the 
same taffy machine at the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad opened this candy shop in 1915. I came here five years later when I was 
10. Dad bought the taffy machine new in 1921. I've been using it ever since," 
explained the 79-year-old candy maker. 
</P>
<P>
Marini has been using the same cotton candy machine more than 50 years. His 
candy showcases are filled with old favorites like red dollars, cola bottles, 
hot lips, juji fruit and jelly beans. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is the oldest amusement park in California, 
described by its owners as the last of the West Coast's seaside amusement 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Its two oldest rides, the 1911 merry-go-round and the 1924 Giant Dipper wooden 
roller coaster are national and state historic landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laser and Penny Games 
</P>
<P>
Side by side with the latest laser video machines in the arcade are penny 
machines, some a century old, that still take only a penny to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic seaboard has nearly two dozen seaside amusement parks from Maine 
to Florida. Once there was a similar string of amusement parks along the 
Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
There was Belmont Park in San Diego, the Pike in Long Beach, Pacific Ocean Park 
in Santa Monica, Whitney's Playland in San Francisco and many more. One by one 
they disappeared, replaced by condos and developments, leaving only the 
boardwalk in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz became famous for its mile-long, wide-wide beach in 1865 when John 
Leibrandt built the first public beach bathhouse here and launched Santa Cruz 
as a seaside resort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destroyed by Fire 
</P>
<P>
In 1904, Fred Swanton opened the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, patterned after 
Coney Island. It was destroyed by fire two years later, rebuilt and reopened in 
1907. 
</P>
<P>
For 82 years the colorful Moorish-style Coconut Grove Ballroom with an array of 
domes, arches and flying flags has been a Santa Cruz landmark. It was renovated 
in 1981 at a cost of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The boardwalk's merry go-round is the work of famed Danish woodcarver Charles 
I. D. Looff, who carved 72 wooden horses and brought in a German-made, 342-pipe 
band organ in creating his Santa Cruz masterpiece. Looff also did the famous 
merry-go-round at Coney Island in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
Looff's horses with long, flowing manes, jewel-studded bridles, muscular legs 
and spirited expressions have been spinning in a circle ever since to the music 
of the antique organ. 
</P>
<P>
In 1924, Looff's son, Arthur, spent 47 days erecting the Giant Dipper at a cost 
of $50,000, one of 80 wooden roller coasters still running in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the park spent $145,000 for a pair of new trains for the Giant 
Dipper, rated as one of the 10 most exciting roller coasters in the country. 
More than 35 million riders have screamed in sheer bliss sailing down the 
70-foot drop at 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still a Thrill 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a thrill every time I ride the Giant Dipper," confessed Charles 
Canfield, 49, president of the Santa Cruz Seaside Co., whose family has 
controlling interest in the private corporation that owns and operates the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Canfield's father, Lawrence, joined the park's board of directors in 1928 and 
served as president from 1952 until his death at 79 in 1984. "I started working 
here running kiddie rides when I was 16," Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The boardwalk is open seven days a week from Memorial Day to Labor Day, 
weekends and holidays the rest of the year. It employs 1,300 during the summer, 
500 to 600 part-time the rest of the year and has an annual payroll of $5.5 
million, according to general manager Ed Hutton, 49. 
</P>
<P>
Each February there is a clam chowder cook-off with 90 booths featuring 90 
different clam chowder recipes. Each October there is a Brussels sprouts 
festival (90% of the nation's Brussels sprouts grow nearby) featuring such 
exotic dishes as Brussels sprout pizza and Brussels sprout ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, to mark the 85th anniversary of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, 
the Santa Cruz County Octagon Museum is featuring a special exhibit on the 
history of the boardwalk called "Never A Dull Moment." 
</P>
<P>
"For 85 years Santa Cruz has had a love affair with the boardwalk," said Miki 
Ryan who put the exhibit together with Nikki Silva. "The boardwalk is a very 
special place for our city."

STEALTH BOMBER ENDS SUCCESSFUL 3RD TEST FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The B-2 Stealth bomber ended the longest and most secretive of its three test 
flights over the Mojave Desert on Saturday with a safe landing here, an Air 
Force spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber, which resembles a bat, took off at 8:30 a.m. from Edwards Air Force 
Base and landed there four hours and 36 minutes later, Capt. Tess Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Richard M. Scofield, program director for B-2 System Program Office, 
called the bomber's third flight successful. "We are extremely pleased with 
today's mission," Scofield said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2's flight Saturday "was by far the longest, highest and fastest thus 
far," Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft flew at 25,000 feet and at speeds of up to 300 knots, or about 345 
m.p.h., she said. In the previous two flights, the bomber never exceeded a 
height of 10,000 feet, speed of 180 knots or two hours in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary mission was to check out the systems and see how it flies," she 
said. "That's what test flights are for, to go a little bit higher, fly a 
little bit faster." 
</P>
<P>
As in the July 17 and Aug. 16 flights, the bomber was piloted by Air Force Col. 
Richard S. Couch and Northrop chief test pilot Bruce Hinds, Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
She did not have any other details about the flight. 
</P>
<P>
The abbreviated second test flight of the radar-evading B-2 on Aug. 16 was 
scrubbed in mid-flight because of a tiny crack in a part provided by a defense 
contractor once fined for billing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive, which powers the 
$530-million jet's generators and controls, caused oil pressure to drop during 
the earlier test flight, Taft said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber's two-hour maiden flight was called a success. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous two test flights, the flight Saturday was not announced in 
advance by the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The government has spent about $22.4 billion on the B-2 program, which is 18 
months behind schedule. Congress has balked at paying more than $500 million 
apiece for 132 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers claim that the use of composite materials combined with its smooth 
leading edges give the bomber a tiny radar signature making it nearly 
impossible for Soviet systems to detect.

TRIPPED BY U.S. HURDLES, CHINESE REFUGEES LOOK ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the months after Chinese military forces crushed the pro-democracy movement 
in Beijing, some protest leaders wanted by Chinese authorities said they fled 
their country only to face difficulties seeking refuge in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After unsuccessful attempts to get U.S. visas or being discouraged from even 
trying after hearing of the difficulties in obtaining one, at least a dozen 
exiled protesters have found temporary sanctuary in countries such as West 
Germany, France and Canada, where the governments have been more open to their 
pleas for help, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," said Cai Chongguo, a scholar who was a leader in the protest 
movement in the city of Wuhan. "American support for the democracy movement was 
so widespread, yet when we need help on some small thing like this, it seems no 
one can help." 
</P>
<P>
Cai spoke in a telephone interview from Paris, where he and at least four 
others eventually obtained political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected More Flexibility 
</P>
<P>
Cai and other Chinese dissidents said that after the military crackdown in 
Beijing, they thought that the United States would be more flexible in granting 
visas, especially after President Bush pledged June 13 to assign more diplomats 
to process visas and do "whatever it takes" to help Chinese nationals fleeing 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
The promise was to give a yes or no answer promptly, but a State Department 
official said then that, in practice, a high percentage of the requests would 
be granted. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the Chinese dissidents who have managed to escape now say that the 
promise was not kept. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of one journalist on a government blacklist in Shenzhen, waiting 
for a U.S. visa in Hong Kong meant nearly three weeks of terror as she stayed 
in hiding for fear of being captured by Chinese agents, said Cao Changqing, 
editor of the Alhambra-based Press Freedom Herald. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Hiding Place 
</P>
<P>
"For 20 days, the U.S. Consulate did not respond," Cao said of his friend's 
visa application. He put the friend, Chen Anchi, in touch with supporters in 
Hong Kong. "She changed her hiding place four times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate for safe haven, Chen finally went to the French Consulate and was 
granted political asylum within one hour, Cao said. She just showed French 
officials evidence such as articles she had written that were critical of the 
Chinese government, he said. Another journalist at the top of the Shenzhen 
blacklist eventually decided to seek sanctuary in Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two more journalists wanted by Chinese authorities remain stranded in Hong 
Kong, Cao said. After being questioned and released by Hong Kong officials last 
week, they were told they have three months to find a country willing to grant 
them permanent refuge, Cao said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because none of the people we've tried to help have been able to get 
permission to come to the United States, these two are discouraged about their 
chances of finding refuge in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
See Lack of U.S. Welcome 
</P>
<P>
Cao said he and other pro-democracy supporters in the United States are getting 
the impression that "the U.S. government does not welcome (Chinese dissidents) 
because if they come, they will hurt Sino-U.S. relations." They said that the 
United States seems to have drawn the line after offering sanctuary to Chinese 
dissident Fang Lizhi at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware that our policy is any more stringent than France or Germany or 
any other country," said a State Department official who spoke on the condition 
that his name not be used. He said a person who has escaped China "is not in 
danger of his life outside of China." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department statement prepared Aug. 15 said that U.S. consular offices 
worldwide have been instructed to review visa applications from Chinese 
nationals "as compassionately as possible, but they must work within the 
framework of existing immigration law," said department spokesman Adam Shub. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the visa laws, there's a certain amount of discretion," said the State 
Department official who asked not to be identified, adding that visa examiners 
are all taking a more liberal view of when a visa applicant would return to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
He said that since the June crackdown in Beijing, U.S. officials have also 
granted refugee status to an unspecified number of Chinese nationals who were 
able to prove that they have a well-founded fear of government persecution. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that U.S. officials allowed top Chinese dissidents such as Wuer 
Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi to visit this country earlier this month to attend a 
pro-democracy conference in Chicago and to tour the country on a fund-raising 
campaign. Wuer, Yan and four others were visiting from France, where they fled 
after China began its manhunt. Wuer has been admitted by Harvard University as 
an undergraduate this fall. 
</P>
<P>
But for less famous exiled Chinese dissidents seeking visas to this country, 
the criteria being used by U.S. officials pose a "Catch-22" situation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, He Wei, a 26-year-old sought by Chinese authorities for his 
protest activities and publication of the Hunger Strike Express news bulletin 
in Beijing, said he fled to West Germany on a tourist visa and has been 
rejected twice by U.S. officials in his application for a student visa. 
</P>
<P>
Accepted as a student by Rutgers University in New Jersey, he said when he 
applied for a student visa, U.S. officials in Bonn told him he had to prove 
that he would return to China after his studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he is not going to return," said Anne Goldstein, legal director of 
the Washington-based International Human Rights Law Group, which is helping He 
and other Chinese dissidents apply for permission to stay in or come to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go back, there's danger," said He, who spoke under an alias instead of 
his real name. 
</P>
<P>
He, who helped coordinate communications between pro-democracy leaders and the 
public during the Beijing protests and has photographs proving his 
participation, said he is reluctant to apply for political asylum in the United 
States because that would affect his chances of ever going back to China to see 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
He said he prefers a student visa that would leave his options open. An 
attorney friend from Hong Kong has already deposited $10,000 with Rutgers to 
pay for his tuition, room and board. In Germany, unable to speak the language, 
he feels stranded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cai in Paris also faces a language problem. He wants to apply for admission to 
a U.S. university but was told he missed the application period for entrance 
this fall. So while he waits for another chance, he is studying English on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, English, not German," he said. "So you can see where I really want to 
go."

President Bush, concerned about developments in Lebanon, discussed the crisis 
with French President Francois Mitterrand by telephone Saturday, the White 
House announced. 
</P>
<P>
The spiritual leader of Lebanese pro-Iranian militants has warned that a French 
naval force off Lebanon will be attacked if it intervenes in the fighting, and 
the lives of some American hostages have been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush discussed his general concern about the general situation in 
Lebanon," the White House said in a statement issued in Maine, where Bush is 
spending a three-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents commented on the U.N. cease-fire in Lebanon and agreed to 
keep the U.N. spotlight on the problem," the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah has accused France, which has assembled a 
fleet of five ships in the eastern Mediterranean, of taking sides in the 
Lebanese conflict. 
</P>
<P>
France, however, insists that the ships, including the 24,000-ton carrier Foch, 
are there to provide aid and remain nearby in the event that an estimated 7,000 
French nationals have to be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he is satisfied that the presence of the French ships is a 
justified precaution, even though it has prompted threats against the lives of 
some American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
According to Muslim political sources, Algeria has dispatched a three-man 
diplomatic team to Beirut on the Lebanese crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had spoken with Algerian officials about Lebanon and the nine Americans 
being held hostage there. 
</P>
<P>
The Algerian team arrived in Beirut on Thursday and held talks with Muslim 
leaders, including acting Premier Salim Hoss, who heads a Syrian-backed 
Cabinet, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Algeria played a key role in defusing the recent crisis involving American 
hostages and has had a leading role in the Arab drive for peace in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the White House statement did not mention hostages specifically, it 
did mention that Bush "reiterated U.S. support for efforts by the Arab League" 
to resolve Lebanon's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Bush and Mitterrand discussed developments in Poland, 
where the first non-Communist government in more than 40 years has taken power. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was quoted as telling the French leader: "We want to help Poland in a 
coordinated way. They need an effective reform program that takes on the 
economic realities they face."

S. AFRICA RULING PARTY'S WHITE SUPPORT WAVERS AS VOTE NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White South Africa's problem, as voter Peter Gray sees it, is that the 
Conservative Party would create "economic disaster" by antagonizing the world, 
and the liberal Democratic Party would allow black revolutionaries to trample 
over the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
What the country needs is "something middle of the road but more 
liberal-minded" than in the past, the banker believes. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Gray, and many whites like him, will probably be voting, somewhat 
reluctantly, for the National Party in South Africa's Sept. 6 parliamentary 
elections, one of the most important in 41 years of apartheid and Nationalist 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I want South Africa to speed up (apartheid) reform," Gray said recently as he 
and his wife waited in a primary school gymnasium in Johannesburg's northern 
suburbs to hear President Frederik W. de Klerk address a political meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"But we South Africans are scared by what we've seen happen to whites in the 
rest of Africa," Gray added. "We're in a minority, and we would need 
protection. How they're going to do that is the question." 
</P>
<P>
In two weeks, 5.5 million whites, Indians and mixed-raced Coloreds will select 
racially segregated chambers of Parliament while the country's 26 million 
disfranchised blacks watch from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's National Party is all but guaranteed a majority in the controlling 
white chamber, despite stiff challenges from the Conservatives on the right and 
the Democrats on the left. But its margin of victory, and the enthusiasm of its 
support, may be at the lowest level in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Many white voters remain skeptical about the Nationalists' promises of "new 
action" and dialogue with black leaders. Even a few government supporters have 
complained that the campaign lacks the ideological fire of days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
In the ward represented by the retiring leader of liberal white politics, Helen 
Suzman, De Klerk was heckled relentlessly in one of his first outings since 
being sworn in as state president following this month's sudden, ignominious 
resignation of Pieter W. Botha, 73. 
</P>
<P>
Above the door to the Houghton Primary School, a National Party campaign poster 
read: "Reject Racism." But a cluster of hand-lettered signs near it suggested 
how difficult it is to change attitudes among white South Africans. Above the 
sign reading "Firearms must be handed in at the lobby" was another put up just 
for the event: "Right of admission reserved." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, an all-white audience had filled all 400 plastic chairs and standing 
space, spilling into the lobby, where a Democratic Party heckler and a De Klerk 
supporter almost came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
The battle in this ward is between the National Party's Dr. Shlomo Peer, a 
retired businessman and Jewish immigrant, and the Democratic Party's Tony Leon, 
a charismatic young Johannesburg City Council politician. Not surprisingly, the 
two men are getting competing signals from voters. 
</P>
<P>
"People are frightened of the left," Peer said in an interview. "They are 
telling me they want economic and political security." 
</P>
<P>
But Leon says he has tapped "a real and conspicuous feeling that the National 
Party just hasn't delivered." Leon notes, for example, that the economy has 
deteriorated sharply, with inflation running at more than 15%, home loan rates 
of 20% and a steady weakening in the value of the South African rand. 
</P>
<P>
For those and other reasons, white support for the National Party is softening 
for the first time in four decades, according to Steven Friedman of the South 
African Institute of Race Relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer an act of betrayal for many whites to vote against the ruling 
party," Friedman wrote recently. "The Nats are increasingly having to win white 
support rather than take it for granted." 
</P>
<P>
The National Party currently holds 120 of the 166 seats in the white chamber of 
Parliament, the Conservatives 22 seats and the Democrats 19. Opinion surveys 
last month indicated that the National Party is losing votes to both the left 
and right, and political analysts think the Conservatives could pick up as many 
as 20 seats and the Democrats could add a dozen or more. That would saddle the 
government with its largest white opposition in years. 
</P>
<P>
To lure undecided voters from opposite ends of the political spectrum, De Klerk 
has been widening his party's hold on the mainstream. The status quo in South 
Africa will have to change, he tells his audiences. But not too quickly, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party vows to maintain racially segregated residential areas, 
schools and hospitals, but it also says it wants to change the constitution to 
share political power with blacks and eventually rule the country by consensus, 
rather than one-person, one-vote. 
</P>
<P>
On the right, the Conservative Party platform calls for a return to 1960s-style 
apartheid and it advocates dividing South Africa into separate geographic 
regions by race. In the "white state," for example, blacks could work but their 
activities would be monitored, and whites would govern. 
</P>
<P>
National Party supporters say the Conservatives' policies would invite 
additional sanctions, ruin the country's economy and probably trigger 
widespread black unrest. 
</P>
<P>
But the Conservative Party, formed in 1982 from a National Party split, has 
grabbed many defecting Nationalists, especially among working-class whites, who 
don't want to compete for jobs or share their neighborhoods, schools, 
hospitals, beaches or parks with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
To the left of the government are the Democrats, a new party formed by a merger 
of the Progressive Federal Party and two smaller parties. The Democrats' power 
base is well-to-do white suburbanites, such as lawyers, academics and 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats advocate government negotiations with the outlawed liberation 
group, the African National Congress, an end to the three-year-old state of 
emergency and the release of all political prisoners. Only then, they say, will 
the country be able to prove to the black majority and to the world that it is 
serious about reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats want to change the constitution, too. They would institute a 
one-person, one-vote system modeled on the American federal system, dividing 
the country into geographic rather than racial groups and giving each region 
proportional representation. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which has refused to negotiate with the ANC unless it 
renounces violence, has tried to paint the Democrats as naive do-gooders who 
are too soft on security and too cozy with black revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
The government's recent crackdown on a campaign of anti-apartheid civil 
disobedience, using legions of policemen armed with whips to break up dozens of 
gatherings and detaining key leaders without trial, has been seen here as an 
attempt to show the electorate that the threat of violence from black 
organizations continues and that it will be dealt with firmly. 
</P>
<P>
While the Nationalists were attempting to hold the middle ground, though, they 
discovered an ideological split in their own ranks. The blowup that led to 
President Botha's Aug. 14 resignation stemmed from a disagreement over a 
meeting that De Klerk, the party leader and Botha's heir apparent, planned with 
Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
Although Botha's resignation was more the result of months of ill feeling 
toward his own party, his bitter farewell speech criticized De Klerk's 
willingness to meet Kaunda, an advocate of sanctions against South Africa and 
host to the ANC, the principal guerrilla group fighting Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
The Botha-De Klerk dispute was not expected to have a broad impact on the 
election, but the Conservative Party has taken the opportunity to suggest that 
the National Party might trade white rights in exchange for peace with the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Among many National Party stalwarts, however, Botha's departure was seen as an 
unseemly burial that was necessary to begin the program of "new action." 
Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha himself told a national TV audience 
that, "with great respect, I must say that (Botha's) memory is sometimes 
faulty." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it came to a head," said Neels Brits, a Johannesburg businessman and 
third-generation Nationalist. "We have compassion for the man (Botha). But the 
simple matter is, there's nothing wrong with the Kaunda visit."

'EQUALITY DAY' MARKED BY ABORTION RIGHTS FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fears that a recent Supreme Court decision could lead to restrictions on 
abortion in California has galvanized women's rights organizations in the area, 
according to many who gathered across Los Angeles County on Saturday to 
celebrate the 19th Amendment, which was ratified 69 years ago this month and 
gave women the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), addressing a conference in Los 
Angeles celebrating Women's Equality Day, said the right to abortion figures to 
be a key issue among voters in the 1990 state elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle over choice is coming to California and to the state Legislature," 
Waters said in a speech to about 200 people at the conference, sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Commission on the Status of Women. "I'm optimistic that we will 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The 19th Amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision in the Missouri abortion case, Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services, gives states new powers to regulate abortions. 
That decision now forces elected officials to make clear their positions on 
abortion, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials who have been vacillating now understand that women are serious 
about that issue," Waters said. "It's all right to be anti-choice, but it's not 
all right to be confused about the issue." 
</P>
<P>
The Webster decision, along with the court's promise to hear more abortion 
cases in the fall, has prompted hundreds of phone calls and new members, said 
Marge Forest, coordinator of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't run our own bodies, we can't run our lives," said Forest, who 
handed out leaflets at a women's conference at Pasadena City College on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Webster decision has made us a lot more aware that our rights are being 
threatened," said Clea Benson, of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. "The day 
after that decision our phones starting ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the California Abortion Rights Action League has doubled in the 
past few months, a rise that Jessica Smith, a member of the group, attributes 
to growing fears of abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But anti-abortion forces also were participants in Saturday's activities. Not 
far from where Forest was handing out material, members of the Right to Life 
League were also passing out literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Our group opposes abortion and we want to make it illegal," said Diane Savoy. 
"We believe it is murder." 
</P>
<P>
Although abortion rights was a hot topic, a variety of issues were advanced by 
a wide range of organizations participating in Saturday's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Unequal pay, expensive child care and cuts to state health care budgets were 
mentioned by several participants, who ranged from the Los Angeles Radical 
Women to the Junior League of Los Angeles to Soroptimists International to the 
Los Angeles Police Department.

MAN IN BANK SAVES DEPUTY FROM ATTACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bank customer in Palmdale became an instant hero Saturday when he jumped into 
a fistfight to save a sheriff's deputy who was being choked by a length of cord 
from his police radio, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The customer, Lee Bibbie of Altadena, enabled veteran Deputy Dennis Bernard to 
free himself from the grasp of a suspected check forger in a fight at a 
Security Pacific bank, Deputy Ronald Thomason of the Antelope Valley/Lancaster 
Sheriff's Department station said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Cedric A. Brown, 35, of Los Angeles, had pinned Bernard to the 
floor and had tightened the radio cord around his neck for about 30 seconds 
before Bibbie came to the deputy's aid, Thomason said. Brown, identified by 
police as a recent parolee on a drug conviction, was arrested moments later 
when more deputies arrived. He was booked on suspicion of forgery and attempted 
murder of a police officer, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bibbie intervening at that particular time perhaps saved Bernard's life," the 
sheriff's spokesman said. "The fight may have turned out quite differently if 
Bibbie had not intervened. Had (the suspect) been able to choke (the deputy) 
unconscious for just for a second, he would have had time to grab the gun out 
of the holster." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident began when Brown tried to deposit a suspicious check 
for $550 and a bank manager notified the sheriff's station. When Bernard, a 
14-year police veteran, entered the bank, Brown tried to flee, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard chased Brown and the two ran into a locked door. In the fight that 
followed, the 6-foot, 2-inch suspect allegedly struck the 5-foot, 10-inch 
deputy several times in the face and attempted to take the officer's 
9-millimeter handgun. At one point, Thomason said, the deputy threw the suspect 
onto a desk, but the officer's momentum carried him and the suspect over the 
desktop and onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect landed on top and was able to grab the microphone and cord from 
Bernard's portable police radio, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wrapped it around Bernard's throat and tried to choke him to death," the 
spokesman said. "Bernard had backup (officers) rolling. The backups were maybe 
two, three minutes away. But it only takes two or three seconds for something 
to go tragically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Bibbie, who helped to subdue the suspect in the crucial moments before backup 
officers arrived, was not injured. He was believed to be the only customer in 
the bank at the time, and was waiting to open an account because he is moving 
to Palmdale, police said. A manager and two tellers were on duty, Thomason 
said.

3 SHERIFF'S OFFICERS DIE IN APPARENT MURDER, SUICIDE 
</P>

PINON HILLS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty San Bernardino County sheriff's detective shot and killed his 
estranged wife and a sergeant with whom she had been romantically involved and 
then committed suicide, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Senior Deputy Gary Vest, 33, shot his estranged wife, 
Deputy Shirley Vest, 40, a booking officer, and Sgt. Richard Crocker, 42, with 
whom she apparently had been living, then turned the gun on himself, Sheriff's 
Deputy Bob Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Not Determined 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact time of the killings had not been determined, investigators 
said they believe that they occurred sometime Friday evening, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Vest and Crocker apparently were living together in the home in Pinon 
Hills where the shooting occurred, he said. Pinon Hills is on the northern side 
of Southern California's San Gabriel Mountains, about 45 miles northeast of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy from the Victor Valley sheriff's substation discovered the bodies at 
the Pinon Hills home about 2:30 a.m. Saturday, Morgan said. He had been sent to 
investigate after the sergeant and booking officer failed to show up for work 
at midnight Friday and numerous calls to the home went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the Vests were found in the front room, near a 9-millimeter 
pistol believed used in the killings, Morgan said. Crocker's body was in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The Vests had been married a little more than a year, but had been separated 
several months, Morgan said. It was not immediately known how long Mrs. Vest 
had been living with Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
Crocker was a 15-year veteran of the department and was divorced. Vest had been 
with the department five years and Mrs. Vest had worked for the department nine 
years.

THE TALK OF THE IRISH; 
</P>
<P>
HARP BY JOHN GREGORY DUNNE (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 235 PP.; 
0-671-68852-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Miles, Miles is The Times' book editor.

<TEXT>
<P>
Harp? Try knell. Though this Irish-American memoir includes a trip to Ireland, 
John Gregory Dunne has less unfinished business with the Emerald Isle than he 
does with the Grim Reaper. But then: Don't we all? And what of it? You can't 
talk of the Irish anyway without talking, soon enough, of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I call myself a harp," Dunne writes, "because I like the sound of the word -- 
it is short, sharp and abusive." I could call myself a harp too; but if I did, 
it would be because I find the word short, sharp and roughly affectionate. It's 
a good one-word title for Dunne's book, all right, but not if you hear it his 
way, only if you hear it mine. Harp Lager doesn't owe its name to an ethnic 
slur. 
</P>
<P>
"Harp" is rather like the life story of an Irish writer as you might hear it in 
a single long night in a bar, especially if you were Irish too, and the writer 
could take the corresponding liberties. In Irish company, it is never bad form 
to bring up your "people." In fact, if too much time passes and you have failed 
to do so, you may receive a gentle invitation. 
</P>
<P>
And when you accept, a certain disarming readiness in your companion -- a sense 
that for him, the family question is not an idle one -- will mix with the drink 
and loosen your tongue. And in short order you'll be telling about your poor 
younger brother, the sweetest, dearest one of the lot of you, and to end that 
way. And then there was your niece, her that was killed, and what you hope 
happens to her murderer there in prison when his fellow convicts get their 
hands on him. (I spare you the details, but in a bar I might not; and in 
"Harp," Dunne doesn't.) 
</P>
<P>
It's not against the rules to talk even of old nuns and elderly maiden aunts 
(not that these categories are mutually exclusive), though you'll most likely 
be doing that in connection with a story about the wake and funeral of one of 
them, and maybe the reading of a will. And then what does that kind of talk 
lead up to but the fate that awaits us all? And then invariably the talk gets 
warmer and better, and the company dearer, as Death -- banished but remembered 
-- waits outside in the dark lane, and the waning of the night is like the 
waning of life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Death is only the penultimate Irish topic, however. The ultimate topic is 
regret. Lost loves. Ruinous mistakes. Vanished youth. Squandered fortunes. 
Broken promises. And for these, you must remain through the last round. 
</P>
<P>
"Harp" declines the last round. It stands in the door with its cap in its hand, 
willing its eyes dry, holding its tongue, because that kind of talk, you know, 
with the tears and all, what good does it do you? Well, the Irish know what 
kind of good it does them; but since "Harp" has held up its end of the 
conversation so well for so long, no one will mind, much, if it leaves a little 
early. 
</P>
<P>
John Gregory Dunne was born in Hartford, Conn., the son of a physician wealthy 
enough to have servants and a six-car garage, the grandson -- on his mother's 
side -- of a banker, in fact, a bank-founder. His irritation with 
</P>
<P>
the Yankee establishment of the Northeast is not the kind felt by the 
</P>
<P>
Irish who didn't make it but the special kind felt by the Irish who did. For 
them, after the fading of the gross differences of wealth and education between 
the Irish and the English in America, what remained was a residual difference 
of style, a difference whose meaning to the Irish Dunne catches brilliantly as 
follows: 
</P>
<P>
"My parents' house . . . looked out on the house of that quintessential Yank 
Thomas Norval Hepburn, a urologist and pioneer in social medicine, but best 
known as the father of Katharine Hepburn; our summer house in Saybrook was only 
a hop, skip and jump from the Hepburns' house in Fenwick. I must confess here a 
certain lack of enthusiasm for the public and cinematic persona of Katharine 
Hepburn -- the feisty lady of quality, a tad feistier and with a tad more 
quality than anyone else within range. She has always seemed to me all 
cheekbones and opinions, and none of the opinions has ever struck me as 
terribly original or terribly interesting, dependent as they are on a rather 
parochial Hartford definition of quality, as reinterpreted by five decades' 
worth of Studio unit publicists. This obiter dictum is, I admit, not a majority 
view." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne's attitude toward Hepburn is, broadly, the attitude of the American Irish 
-- at least of his generation -- toward the Yankees. Yankee "quality" has 
always seemed to them to be a distinction without a difference, a glance 
downward from the Olympian flats. Books like Robert C. Christopher's recent 
"Crashing the Gates: The De-WASPing of America's Power Elite" (Simon &amp; 
Schuster) may be right to claim that the fire is mostly gone out of this old 
fight. The erstwhile aristocracy has become, at best, a "class act," like the 
Hepburn act; at worst, a set of mannerisms and commodities packaged -- as in 
Ralph Lauren's "Polo" line of costumery -- for anyone who, God save us, wants 
to look that way. And yet "Harp," running atavistically athwart such claims, 
isn't entirely wrong either. If John Dunne wears his slightly bruised Celtic 
heart on his sleeve, a similar bruise may be found darkening other, less 
prominently displayed hearts, not all of them, by any means, Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly bruised, I said, and I used the adverb advisedly. By the time Dunne 
had graduated from Princeton (yes, not B.C. or the Cross) and done his stint in 
the U.S. Army in Germany (a full chapter on that time), a difference had taken 
hold of him that would dwarf all merely ethnic differences; namely, the 
difference between the writer and the rest of mankind. There is in this book -- 
curiously, perhaps, though I can't say I much miss it -- nothing of the usual 
making-of-the-writer sort: no first jobs, mentors, breakthroughs, crucial 
lessons, etc. The writer in this book is the writer Dunne has become, not the 
writer he was at any point along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the suicide of his younger brother, Stephen, and ending with his 
own heart attack in Central Park, "Harp" is, en route, a mix of dead Dunne 
relatives (and one friend) remembered and the live novelist/journalist at work. 
The tone in the author-at-work sections wavers between oblique vaunt -- "This 
is what I do!" -- and equally oblique dread -- "Is this what I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Thus, early in the book, Dunne writes: "(Writing) is the only job I have. I do 
not teach, I rarely lecture. I occasionally do screenplays, but the operative 
word is 'do'; doing screenplays does for me what doing screenplays did for 
Faulkner: it buys time." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the book, however, after the heart attack, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
" 'I think I know how to end this book now,' I said to my wife on the walk home 
from (the doctor's). I knew I did not have to spell it out to her. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Terrific,' she said, the novelist in her taking precedence over the wife who 
knew her husband too well ever to express the concern she felt, the husband who 
was so volatile except in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
" 'It's a hell of an ending,' I said, and what I meant was that a writer's life 
is his only real capital, his and his alone to invest, and to imagine, and to 
reimagine, even unto this. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, hell, yes, it's what I do." 
</P>
<P>
What do you do? -- the great American question. And as the writer's life draws 
nearer its close, the great American follow-up question: What have I done? I 
find it utterly Irish of Dunne to manage his answer in asides during a long 
night of talk about death in the family. And for once the Irish way seems a 
reasonable way. The question What have I done? is a beast best taken from the 
flank. One senses that Dunne does indeed have a few regrets, or at least a few 
longstanding worries that may someday mature and blossom as regrets. But this 
is just a hunch, one reader's extrapolation. The writer himself says little. 
</P>
<P>
"Harp" is, I would note before closing, Irish in one other particular. When I 
come home from an evening out with my oldest Irish friend, my wife always asks 
about his wife. And I never have anything to report. I always feel a little 
sheepish saying, "Well, she didn't come up. I mean, she did, of course, several 
times, but we didn't talk about her." Joan Didion appears at several crucial 
moments in "Harp," including the one just noted (it is indeed a hell of an 
ending, by the way); she is not, however, among her husband's public subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
Winsome, accommodating beyond the usual measure, and unpredictably, 
truculently, cripplingly touchy: That's how the Irish seem to me. Dunne is 
Irish in all these ways: thin-skinned and easily aggrieved; engaging, 
invincibly gregarious; and, depending on your cause, combatively at your 
service as scarcely another writer of his prominence in the nation. "Harp" is 
just the kind of book that such a man would write, a book that welcomes you in, 
talks to you wonderfully for a while, takes you into its confidence, then backs 
off just a bit abruptly ("Was it something I said?" you wonder) and takes its 
leave. If you know someone like that, and if you find him, on balance, worth 
the trouble, then you may find "Harp" worth the trouble too.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: WHY KIDS LIE BY PAUL ECKMAN, PH.D. (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S 
SONS: $17.95; 206 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Children fabricate answers to discomfiting questions for the same reasons 
adults do: to avoid punishment, to acquire something they will otherwise be 
denied, to avoid confrontation, to cover shameful secrets. Everyone tells lies, 
even if it is only to thank someone for a disappointing present. 
</P>
<P>
In "Why Kids Lie," psychologist Paul Ekman asserts that children who develop 
the habit of lying are likely to get into more serious trouble eventually. He 
emphasizes that the ubiquitousness of lying makes it imperative that parents 
discuss with children what lying means, so they will not get into the habit of 
the "easy out." He also describes some of the ways in which parents unwittingly 
teach their children to lie through the adult exchanges that take place in the 
childrens' presence. 
</P>
<P>
The book offers a rough guide to what is "normal" development in the ability 
and tendency to lie, and what special circumstances -- divorce, for instance -- 
often cause children to begin lying suddenly. A final chapter, titled "Kids' 
Testimony in Court," concerns the delicate area of child abuse.

DESERT SCULPTURES

by Henry J. Morro 
</P>
<P>
We go back to the desert 
</P>
<P>
and I lay my head on my mother's stomach 
</P>
<P>
and listen to the place 
</P>
<P>
where I began, 
</P>
<P>
when she carried me on legs that opened 
</P>
<P>
and burned rocks in the desert, 
</P>
<P>
legs balanced on swollen feet 
</P>
<P>
across a cracked earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I listen to the water beneath those feet, 
</P>
<P>
the water lost by bareback mothers, 
</P>
<P>
the water slashed from yucca roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I split a cactus 
</P>
<P>
and pour the juice on my mother's feet. 
</P>
<P>
As she curls up in the sand, 
</P>
<P>
together 
</P>
<P>
we watch our skin perspire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We become darker, 
</P>
<P>
our bellies soft like lizards, 
</P>
<P>
our fingers digging into the sand, 
</P>
<P>
waiting for the sun to go down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We lie in pools of sweat, 
</P>
<P>
our water returning to the desert 
</P>
<P>
beginning the erosion of another canyon, 
</P>
<P>
our sweat 
</P>
<P>
carving the earth. 
</P>
<P>

Photo, In the 1830s, American essayist, philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo 
Emerson visited Italy with heavy burdens on his heart: grief over losing his 
young wife and doubt over his direction as a Unitarian minister. In his 
journals he wrote of "the wise man whom every where I seek." Among his stops 
was a pilgrimage to the home of the 14th-Century poet Petrarch, whose chair, 
photographed here, stands in the Arqua Petrarca. Emerson's journey is 
chronicled in "Emerson in Italy" (Henry Holt: $45), with text by Evelyn Barish 
and photographs by Evelyn Hofer.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: RUSSIA'S RULERS UNDER THE OLD REGIME BY DOMINIC LIEVEN 
(YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $35; 407 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This meticulously researched book describes the Russian ruling elite in the 
reign of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II. It seeks to answer the question: What 
kind of men governed Russia in the Empire's last years? Dominic Lieven focuses 
on the 215 men appointed to Nicholas' State Council, analyzing statistical 
data, their education and careers and their ideas about politics. 
</P>
<P>
Lieven discovers that one-third of the State Council members were "pure" 
Russian aristocracy, with noble ancestors reaching into the 16th Century. At 
the time of Peter the Great in the 17th Century, there was an influx of 
foreigners into the government. Lieven traces the German ancestry of certain 
members of the ruling elite by searching church records and discovering whose 
family was Protestant and whose Russian Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
Having "attempted with due statistical solemnity to pin-point the social status 
of all members of the State Council," Lieven recognizes the individual 
differences within his group, and etches these with great clarity. He gives 
personal anecdotes of State Council members: Semyonov once crawled on the 
ground in full-dress senatorial uniform "in order to look at a painting by a 
Dutch master from the best possible angle"; Andrei Saburov led a crusade to 
rescue prostitutes; "Gramophone" Kokostov was so named because he loved the 
sound of his own "loud, well-rounded phrases." 
</P>
<P>
Education rather than class in the strict sense defined the ruling elite, 
Lieven argues. The Romanovs founded both the Lycee and the School of Law 
(reputedly where idle youths were sent), and retained close ties with these 
schools, which produced many members of the ruling body. Young men were 
expected to become fluent in French and while in the Lycee, all wore an 
old-fashioned uniform with a tricorn hat and a sword symbolizing the 
aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
Although he does not directly address the question of the elite's role in the 
revolutionary period, Lieven offers a basis for understanding the men who were 
unseated in the fall of the old regime. "In a way that was genuinely tragic," 
Lieven writes, "the higher the ideals, the humanity and the level of culture of 
the members of the ruling elite, the further removed they were in many ways 
from the demagogic techniques which might have made the mobilization of mass 
support more feasible."

A CAPITOL KIND OF RIVALRY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE AND SENATE BY ROSS K. BAKER (W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 210 PP.; 0-393-02706-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John H. Taylor, Taylor is former President Nixon's chief aide.

<TEXT>
<P>
"House and Senate" is the closest thing to a readable political science text 
that you will find these days. As a narrowly drawn study of whether the two 
houses of the United States Congress are different or similar, it is typical in 
theme of a genre replete with narrowly drawn studies. Ross K. Baker finds that 
the House of Representatives and Senate are sometimes similar but mostly 
different, a conclusion so self-evident to the average reader of the 
Constitution and the daily newspapers that one must ask why getting there took 
him 210 pages. But he spices it up with enough insights, asides, and quips that 
political science undergraduates, destined to be his principal audience, will 
find it a revelation. Compared to the rest of the literature, it is positively 
Byronic. 
</P>
<P>
If to make these general criticisms of political science is to question the 
whole field's raison d'etre, then, as an undergraduate victim of the abysmal 
science, J'accuse. Many a student has plowed through complicated texts or 
journal articles only to discover finally what is axiomatic to old pros like 
John Sasso and Lyn Nofziger: "Most elections hinge on the state of the 
economy," or "Incumbents will eat their young to be re-elected." Even from the 
likes of Prof. Baker you can get a windy belaboring of the obvious in some 
passages, along with chapter titles that sound like rhymes from old Motown 
songs ("Convergence, Divergence, and Persistence"). 
</P>
<P>
Most political practitioners, proud of learning by doing, are as contemptuous 
of political scientists as composers are of music critics. On the other hand, 
if we were all instinctual geniuses, we wouldn't need our outstanding system of 
colleges and universities. And even if a veteran surgeon can point at an artery 
and say: "Just cut that one, piece of cake," baby docs must still log some book 
time before slicing and dicing. So too, I suppose, must tomorrow's political 
science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, expect to have your suspicions confirmed rather than your horizons 
expanded by "House and Senate." Twenty pages in, Baker quotes Champ Clark, 
speaker of the House from 1911 to 1919, as saying congressmen liked to become 
senators for these reasons: "First, the longer term; second, their votes are 
more important; third, patronage; fourth, participation in treaty-making; 
fifth, greater social recognition." And that, it turns out, is just about it 
even nowadays. We also learn that most reporters and editors prefer to cover 
senators; that senators generally must be lobbied one-on-one rather than in 
groups; that senators, being fewer, serve on more committees so still tend to 
specialize less than representatives. And we learn that the late Sen. Frank 
Church of Idaho was so contemptuous of the lower house that en route home each 
evening he went out of his way to avoid driving past the House office 
buildings, which when you think about it was carrying a thing a bit too far. 
</P>
<P>
The non-specialist should not and would not turn to "House and Senate." It is 
not a survey book on the Congress but a study of Baker's thesis that the 
difference built into the two houses by the Framers have managed to endure in 
spite of television and various other modern evils. In a brisk concluding 
chapter he shows, through an analysis of the 1986 and 1988 drug bills, how the 
House will respond quickly to the demands of the rabble while the Senate puffs 
its pipe and takes the ostensibly more responsible long view -- "long" as in 
roughly six election-free years. 
</P>
<P>
If the solons of the upper house indeed envision themselves as more 
statesmanlike than their House colleagues, an unnamed lobbyist tells Baker the 
real reason why: "More often than not (senators) don't know what the hell 
you're talking about. Yeah, you need to talk in concepts -- what's good for 
America -- but I don't think that's because they have any deeper feelings for 
America than the guys in the House. I think it's just because they don't know 
the details as well. You can't talk to them any other way." The extensive 
interviews that Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers, conducted 
with members, reporters, and lobbyists give "House and Senate" far more of 
these real-world touches than most comparable tomes. 
</P>
<P>
There is still too much jargon about "electoral environments," "the ecology of 
the House and Senate," and "the attentive elites." Baker also has the scholar's 
irritating proclivity for dropping a quotation from another writer into his 
text without attribution, leaving the reader to scurry to consult the footnote 
to learn who's talking. But then, every few pages, he takes a deep breath and 
produces some inspired writing. "The House leader," he writes, "ministers to a 
flock; the Senate leader more nearly resembles the chaplain in a medieval court 
whose ministrations were highly personalized and phrased with the delicacy and 
diplomacy that acknowledged the power and vanity of his communications." That 
kind of prose could get a man drummed out of the American Political Science 
Assn. if he is not careful. "Let's have less poetry next time, Baker," they 
will say, "and more charts and graphs." 
</P>
<P>
Again, this book is about the dynamics of bicameralism, not "Congress Today." 
But to appeal to a broader audience, which Baker and his publisher clearly 
hoped to do, I would have taken on some currently hot congressional issues. We 
learn that House members are more closely attuned to the wishes of their 
districts than senators are to those of their states, but we don't learn 
whether Baker believes it is entirely fitting that House members have managed 
to parlay their big staffs, gerrymandered districts, and extensive 
prerequisites into almost guaranteed reelection. Something on the growing 
influence of political action committees and their campaign contributions would 
have been germane. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, what about ethics, both financial and political? In an interview with 
Baker, former Sen. John Culver of Iowa argued that senators are more 
accommodating of one another's political needs than House members. "There's the 
feeling that if I get it through the Senate and write my press release," Culver 
said, "I'll drop it in (the) conference (between the House and Senate) because 
I've done my thing politically." The man was saying that a senator would gladly 
take the credit for some measure without ever intending to make the effort to 
enact it. The remark's blithe hypocrisy is unremarked upon by the author, but 
the reader catches a glimpse of the Congress he has come to know so well -- a 
place where the real political science is the perfection of the fine art of 
protecting every member's self-interest no matter what.

In reviewing my novel, "Blue Notes Under a Green Felt Hat" (Book Review, Aug. 
6), Leonard Feather compared my literary voice to Robin Leach's TV voice. 
Feather meant to be nasty, but I see it differently. Leach has a unique, 
recognizable and humorous commercial voice. That's what I'm aiming for. My 
novel is pop entertainment. Feather reviewed it as serious literature, 
criticizing it for something it was never meant to be.

BEFUDDLED BIOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molly Giles' review of "William Faulkner: American Writer" (Book Review, Aug. 
20) stands as the first, to my knowledge, to dig beneath the sheer massiveness 
of the volume to expose biographer Frederic R. Karl's destructive bone-picking 
of a great American novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Giles charitably refrained from pointing out that the biography is largely an 
appropriation of the published works of recognized Faulkner scholars and that 
his principal contribution is a warped, far-out psychoanalysis of Faulkner's 
personal life, cradle to grave. 
</P>
<P>
The definitive biography of Faulkner has been a work-in-progress for many years 
by Garvel Collings, who knows more about his subject than any other living 
American. Giles and the Book Review are to be commended for a brave critical 
CAT-scan of a grievously flawed biography.

SOVIET SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was glad to see your review of "Soviet Humor: The Best of Krokodil" (Book 
Review, Aug. 13), as I will be hosting a delegation of Soviet humorists (some 
of them writers for Krokodil) at UCLA in October. The event, which is jointly 
sponsored by Antioch University and UCLA Extension, will discuss similarities 
and differences between American and Russian humor, and will feature several 
well-know American humorists as well. Information: (213) 825-5362. 
</P>
<P>
A minor cavil: The cartoons in "Soviet Humor" are not all caricatures, as your 
reviewer suggests. They range from the whimsical to the philosophical and 
include many skillful, artistic, and thought-provoking drawings.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE FARM ON THE RIVER OF EMERALDS BY MORITZ THOMSEN

At age 53, Moritz Thomsen set out to establish a farm on the Esmeraldas River 
in the jungles of Ecuador. Working with a native partner, he battled weather, 
insects, floods, animals, hostile neighbors and the jungle itself. A 
potentially fascinating subject, but Thomsen's sentences are so chocked with 
adjectives, adverbs and inapt metaphors that the reader needs the syntactical 
equivalent of a machete to get through them. A description of the tropical 
wilderness: "It is so opulent, so rich, in the final analysis so basically 
vulgar -- like the over-orchestration of Richard Strauss -- that no one I can 
think of, except Rousseau, has ever succeeded in capturing its 
million-textured, chaotic quality and transforming it into art." Reading this 
prose makes clearing jungle land seem like a simple task.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PINHEAD'S PROGRESS BY BILL GRIFFITH (E.P. DUTTON: $8.95)

<TEXT>

Bill Griffith's better "Zippy the Pinhead" comic strips suggest "Candide" 
re-written by the staff of People Magazine. Griffith satirizes the triumph of 
packaging over content in contemporary America by celebrating it. The ultimate 
consumer of media hype, Zippy embraces every fad like a long-lost relative. His 
life is a banquet -- catered by Hostess Bakeries in Leona Helmsley's ballroom, 
with Tupperware dishes, music by K-Tell and Engelbert Humperdinck as emcee. 
Griffith's work falters only when it becomes self-conscious: His heavy-handed 
caricatures of Ronald Reagan and George Bush lack the originality of his often 
withering spoofs of Tammy Faye Bakker, Naugahyde, Ernie Bushmiller's "Nancy," 
Sonny Bono and Dunkin' Donuts.

George Torres writes about the U.S. Space Program and the shuttle program in 
particular with the relentless boosterism of a used-car salesman describing the 
bargains on his lot. He ignores the questions about overspecialization raised 
by critics of the shuttle, much as he ignores the enormous and, in the opinion 
of many experts, insurmountable problems of creating a functional SDI system. 
The illustrations help redeem the text, especially the photographs from the 
Apollo missions, which recall the excitement and hope that galvanized the 
nation only 20 years ago.

Anger hangs like a pall over this brooding story of interracial murder in a 
small Southern town during the '50s. The coldly amoral Paris Trout feels no 
remorse when he inadvertently shoots a black teen-ager and wounds her guardian, 
but his trial releases tensions hidden within the social fabric of Cotton 
Point, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
As his problems intensify, Trout darkens the lives of everyone unfortunate 
enough to come in contact with him: his abused, sensual wife, Hanna; his 
lawyer, Harry Seagraves, a prominent, civic-minded hypocrite, and Carl Bonner, 
an earnest young man, burdened with the fame he earned when he became the 
youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
As an evocation of the claustrophobic, racist society of the rural South before 
integration, Pete Dexter's National Book Award-winning novel is matched only by 
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird."

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Coughenour's breed is rarer than the Bachman sparrow, a tiny Ozarks 
songbird on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
Coughenour bands hummingbirds -- ruby-throated hummingbirds, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
Only 31 people are fully licensed by the federal government to put numbered 
metal bands on the legs of the tiny aerial acrobats. Coughenour is among a few 
who have limited permits to work under supervision of the "master" banders. 
</P>
<P>
"I've banded about 350 hummingbirds in the three years I've been licensed. I 
might end up banding 250 to 300 this year," said Coughenour, 41, who learned to 
band from his great-uncle, Jim Johnson, the only master in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 85, of Holister, Mo., has banded about 2,000 hummingbirds over the 
last 20 years, earning him the nickname "The Hummingbird Man." Coughenour's 
sister, Sarah Driver of Springfield, also bands under his direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quest for Information 
</P>
<P>
"There's millions of hummingbirds out there, and there's just not enough of us 
banding," said Coughenour. "The whole reason for banding is to get information 
about birds and their habits, particularly migration." 
</P>
<P>
Coughenour, a businessman who bands birds as a hobby, uses a homemade nylon net 
trap, with a feeder filled with sugar water as bait, to catch the "hummers" at 
his home in Nixa and at the Springfield Nature Center. 
</P>
<P>
He then carefully weighs the birds -- most weigh about 3 grams, the equivalent 
of three plastic sandwich bags -- and notes the sex, approximate age and 
general condition. The whole process takes just a few minutes.

Seventeen species of hummingbirds are found in the United States, but only the 
ruby-throated variety is common east of the Great Plains. 
</P>
<P>
Hummingbirds are attracted to almost any plant with red blossoms and are easily 
drawn to feeders filled with one part sugar to four parts water. Johnson said 
the ruby-throats, named for the male's brilliant red throat patch, consume up 
to a gallon of sugar water a day at 10 feeders around his home each summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Energy 
</P>
<P>
The long-billed birds have a voracious appetite for sweet nectar to fuel their 
supercharged metabolism. Hummingbirds' wings beat an astounding 50 to 70 times 
a second as they hover and feed, but speed up to 200 beats per second when they 
need to zip away at up to 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Hummingbirds migrate long distances, including a 600-mile trip non-stop across 
the Gulf of Mexico to spend the winter in South and Central America. The birds 
can live five to eight years and return each year to the same territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found them to be just such friendly little rascals. They are so 
curious," Johnson said. "They have some kind of personal reaction to humans. 
It's hard to describe, but once you get to fooling with them, you realize they 
are very responsive birds. You can really get to know them individually." 
</P>
<P>
Making friends with a hummingbird is "no trouble at all. All you need is sugar 
water to get their attention, he said." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a standing bet with people that if they have one to three hummingbirds 
at a feeder, I can have one perching on my finger in 20 minutes. If you get 
near the feeder and remain motionless, they'll perch right on your finger as 
they feed. It's the darndest thing." 
</P>
<P>
Coughenour, who gives talks and banding exhibitions each summer at the 
Springfield Nature Center, said, "Many of the older people remember a time when 
everyone had formal flower gardens and people would sit outside in the 
summertime and really enjoy the hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people my age have never seen a hummingbird. When they do, they're 
fascinated. It's a real joy, particularly with little kids, to see the delight 
in their eyes when showing them such a small, fragile creature. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very, very beautiful to look at."

GUITAR MAKER TAKES TIME TO CREATE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE WORKS OF ART

<P>
Danny Ransom spent the first six months of his career tediously making deformed 
electric guitars for $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of art, that sell 
for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that includes some of the world's 
best-known musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one guitar body and a 
dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a craftsman like Ransom spends 
several days, sometimes weeks, on a single instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, 'We build the most 
perfect machine in the world,' and most of their stuff is junk," Ransom said. 
"I've had to make sure every instrument is right." 
</P>
<P>
Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-making business 13 years. He has made 
guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and Alabama. Laurie Anderson 
and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer violins he made for a company called 
Zeta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understands Complexities 
</P>
<P>
Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's Stratocaster-style 
guitars last year from a friend. He said Ransom understands the complexities of 
the instrument and how the different parts interact. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most guitar makers," 
Kaiser said. "It's just a versatile, expressive instrument." 
</P>
<P>
An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-strewn studio adjacent 
to "Real Guitars," a collector's guitar store in the city's South of Market 
district. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Ransom was low man on the guitar-maker totem pole. He 
first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now defunct, initially 
making what he calls "the worst garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff workers had a habit of taking 
LSD on the job and "talking to the tools." 
</P>
<P>
"The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was brought in," 
Ransom recalled. "They stuck me in a room with a bunch of tools, handed me a 
guitar and said, 'Make these.' " 
</P>
<P>
His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping $10 each. They 
were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bursts Into Flames 
</P>
<P>
One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first time he had 
completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The final touches required 
a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided to show him how it was done. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals burning on it," 
Ransom said. "I said, 'Do you know what you're doing?' He said, 'Shut up, of 
course I do.' Then the glue line started to lift off and the thing burst into 
flames right in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. . . . This is like 
watching your child burn." 
</P>
<P>
Things started to pick up after other workers began teaching him. Ransom said 
the difference between a good guitar and a bad guitar lies in the details, such 
as the curves in the wood and placement of the finger board and joints. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail. The better you 
can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get at whatever you do in 
terms of craft. That's really what I got from some of the people who helped me 
early on." 
</P>
<P>
His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made mostly of 
alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards, armed with density and 
moisture meters, to find the right wood. Soft woods, such as mahogony, tend to 
give off more mid-range sound while harder woods, such as poplar, produce the 
higher, treble sounds. 
</P>
<P>
He has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash from 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, cuts them out on a 
bandsaw, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on a pin 
router. Finally, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows and bellys 
are cut by hand. 
</P>
<P>
As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s, Ransom had planned 
to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his experience working with wood was 
in making matchstick holders and other "goofy little things" when he was a Cub 
Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is an admitted "Deadhead" -- Grateful Dead fan -- Ransom is not 
much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset than a liability for a 
maker of electric guitars and violins. 
</P>
<P>
"The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but aren't players tend 
to be much more versatile in their building and are much more involved in the 
quality of their instrument, not just the sound or the playability, but the 
overall quality."

AIDS PROGRAM AIMS AT INDIGENT LATINOS

Juan Luis Merced takes his message about AIDS to park benches, gay bars, soup 
kitchens and crack houses. 
</P>
<P>
He goes door to door in mostly Latino neighborhoods handing out flyers about 
where to go for information and testing for El Sida -- AIDS in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
As the AIDS virus seeps into the nation's smaller cities, there is a growing 
need for people to take AIDS education to those who need it most: intravenous 
drug users, minorities, the homeless, the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are the ones who are missed through the more traditional modes of 
health education," said Imani Thompson, a health education specialist for the 
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. "It makes sense that people in 
smaller communities are trying to figure out methods to deal with this because 
this problem is everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The tests here are conducted at the Heartside Clinic, which began the AIDS 
program in May with state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is located in a tiny storefront in the heart of the city's Skid Row, 
which attracts a large percentage of the city's transient population, drug and 
substance abusers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Of those coming to the clinic, about 80% are considered at high risk of 
contracting AIDS. Of about 80 tests conducted since May, 14 people have tested 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
Outside God's Kitchen, the city's biggest soup kitchen, Merced greets many of 
the dozens of men and women who form a line halfway down the block for a free 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be a friend first and get their trust," said Merced, 29. "They know 
me as the AIDS man. And that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Testing 
</P>
<P>
Merced, a native of Puerto Rico, has been successful in getting indigent 
members of the city's Latino community into the clinic for free testing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been flooded since we got someone who can break the language barrier," 
project director Pat O'Connor said. "That's not easy to find in this part of 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
For those who test positive for the HIV virus, counselors construct a "life 
plan," arranging for medical care, housing and food. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a disenfranchised group of people, you can't tell them that 
they'll have to go to one place to fill out a form, go to another halfway 
across town to get their medical care and another to get food. . . . The next 
time you'll see them, they'll be in the emergency room," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, some people questioned whether such a program was needed in 
this conservative western Michigan city of 180,000, said Dr. David Baumgartner, 
medical director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Amount of Denial' 
</P>
<P>
"There was and continues to be a tremendous amount of denial in this community 
that HIV is a problem," Baumgartner said. "But it's like a ball rolling 
downhill, gaining momentum. As word gets out, we keep seeing more and more 
people coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the 
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
As of July 31, 1989, the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had 
recorded a cumulative total of 102,621 cases of AIDS in the United States, with 
59,391 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have already been 
infected with the AIDS virus, and of that total, 20% to 30% will develop AIDS 
by the end of 1991.

IMMIGRATION REFORM HASN'T DRIED UP POOL OF FARM LABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BIGHAM, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many California farmers feared they would have a hard time finding enough 
workers after tougher federal restrictions against using illegal aliens took 
effect last winter. 
</P>
<P>
As with many fears, this one has not materialized, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly farm labor report from the state Economic Development Department 
consistently lists labor surpluses in most agricultural areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Several counties along the coast and in the Sacramento Valley reported 
surpluses of between 100 and 200 workers, and some San Joaquin Valley counties 
showed surpluses of up to 400 workers. Areas in-between harvests reported even 
higher surpluses -- 1,000 in Monterey County, 2,500 or more in Imperial County 
and 5,000 to 7,000 in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"The picture we are seeing now is pretty much the picture we have been seeing 
all along," said Suzanne Schroeder, an Employment Department spokeswoman in 
Sacramento. "The immigration law has not made the impact that we've been able 
to document on any kind of major scale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Started 3 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
State employment officials began publishing the report three years ago to keep 
tabs on the labor situation during harvest months under the immigration law's 
tightened sanctions against hiring undocumented workers. Each employment office 
in agricultural areas reports surpluses or shortages each week. 
</P>
<P>
"We first started putting out the report because of publicity that we would 
have massive shortages in people to harvest California's various crops," 
Schroeder said. "We haven't seen any evidence of that materializing." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said she does not have an explanation for the continuing surpluses in 
the fields but noted that they favor growers while shortages would give 
employees better opportunities for jobs at better wages. 
</P>
<P>
"From the growers' perspective, they always like to see a surplus, always like 
to have as many workers as they need," she said. "From the farm workers' point 
of view, they want to be at a place where they can do some work and not have a 
time when their skills and services aren't needed." 
</P>
<P>
The state's findings are confirmed by a survey that California Farmer magazine 
conducted among about 500 farmers, ranchers and agricultural service companies. 
That poll indicated that immigration reform has not yet significantly affected 
employment, pay or crop production. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers who responded to the 46-page questionnaire said if immigration reform 
eventually does reduce the amount of seasonal help available, they probably 
will turn to farm labor contractors for more of their work force, letting the 
contractors absorb more of the paper work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Phase of Program 
</P>
<P>
Any future trend toward a shortage in field help may be eased by the second 
phase of the immigration reform program that starts in October. The first 
phase, special agricultural workers or SAW sign-ups, was conducted last year to 
legalize the status of aliens who had worked on U.S. farms long enough to make 
them eligible to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new program is dubbed RAW for replenishment agricultural workers. The 
number of such workers allowed to enter the United States will be based on 
estimates of need nationwide provided by the secretaries of labor and 
agriculture. They sent the Immigration and Naturalization Service a letter last 
month indicating up to 50,000 RAW workers will be needed in the next fiscal 
year, said Howard R. Rosenberg, an agricultural labor management specialist for 
UC Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the rules as tentatively laid out may indirectly encourage 
applicants to enter the United States illegally to avoid the more difficult 
task of applying from abroad by obtaining a registration card from a "qualified 
designated entity," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Odds Cited 
</P>
<P>
"What it all means for the RAW eligible in Mexico is that odds are going to be 
a lot better," Rosenberg said. "There's a lot more incentive to illegally cross 
now and be able to file that registration from within the United States than to 
try to follow the rules down there." 
</P>
<P>
He added that once people become eligible under that program to work on farms 
in the United States, they can work in California even if the state has a 
surplus of help. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the free-market system, they can go anywhere in the United States where 
they can get a job," Rosenberg said.

IT'S NO FUN BEING A GANGSTER, EXPERT SAYS: STRESS CAN DO THE WORK OF A HIT MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Mafia gangsters suffer worse stress than top businessmen and are as likely to 
die from that as from a bullet, according to a top Sicilian pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Francesco Aragona, who has spent 40 years examining their insides, says 
Mafiosi are likely to have thickened arteries, kidney failure, stomach ulcers, 
sterility and mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Their livers are yellowish, fatty and chronically short of glucose, says 
Aragona, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Messina. 
</P>
<P>
"The strains of a violent criminal life lead to internal conflict and the 
individual can become extremely disturbed, both physically and mentally," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They become incapable of responding to any stimulus and can die from heart 
attacks or strokes just as easily as a shotgun blast." 
</P>
<P>
Gang warfare in and around Reggio Calabria, Italy's most violent city just 
across the Straits of Messina, has provided a steady supply of corpses for his 
research and he and his team perform hundreds of autopsies each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the victims have been in a state of extreme agitation and alarm for a 
long time," Aragona said. As a result their bodies are constantly pumping out 
adrenaline, reducing blood sugar and increasing pressure on the heart. 
</P>
<P>
After a while all hormone-producing organs such as the thyroid, pituitary and 
adrenal glands are weakened, altering the whole metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
"Take this case of a 32-year-old man killed in his car in Reggio Calabria," 
said Aragona, of a victim of a sawed-off shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
"His organs show clear signs of stress." 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of his adrenal gland seen under a microscope show that instead of the 
normal black clump of hormone there are a few shrivelled, gray globules. 
</P>
<P>
"The production of (the hormone) cortisone is almost completely exhausted. If 
the process had gone on much longer he could have died anyway," Aragona said. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways the effects are similar to "executive stress," suffered by people 
in more conventional but nevertheless high-pressure jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is that these people show the classic symptoms of stress at a 
very young age. The heart attacks and strokes businessmen get aged 50 or 60, 
the Mafia get under 30," Aragona said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this slide. He was only 27 years old but has the brain of an old man." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone on the run either from the police or from Mafia hit men is likely to 
suffer from acute stress. Aragona said they were often pale, thin, ate 
irregularly and were invariably sterile. 
</P>
<P>
But such problems do not trouble many senior Mafia bosses, figures commanding 
huge respect, who usually remain above the killing and gang war for drugs and 
building rackets, leaving the fighting to their men. 
</P>
<P>
"They often live quietly at home, eat well and have lots of children," Aragona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the frequency and violence of Mafia "hits" it is easy to understand 
the anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
One man studied by Aragona had a screwdriver rammed into his skull. Reggio 
Calabria province, which regularly tops Italy's homicide league, had 165 
murders last year. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally murderers will leave ritual symbols, such as a cork in the mouth 
of an informer. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred murder method by gang members in Calabria, however, is by 
sawed-off shotgun, which leaves the skull practically unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that when gang members carry out the crime the damage is far 
worse. They try to make the body completely unrecognizable," Aragona said. 
"When it's a hired assassin, often one bullet will do."

WHEN STORMS THREATEN FARMS IN SWITZERLAND, WHO YA' GONNA CALL? HAIL-BUSTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
When storm clouds come boiling over Lake Zurich toward Ernst Spoehel's 
cornfields, the Swiss farmer knows just how to prevent a vicious hailstorm from 
devastating his crops. 
</P>
<P>
His sense of imminent danger honed by 20 years of experience, Spoehel rushes to 
his barn, loads a small plastic rocket with a packet of silver iodide, and 
fires it into the clouds a mile above him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the front coming, and when you have the feeling that danger is 
near, you start to shoot," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Spoehel and hundreds of other farmers are convinced that they immunize the 
clouds against hailstorms by peppering the skies with their rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and insurance companies are more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that hailstones form when masses of cool and warm air collide, 
causing small droplets of moisture in the air to condense around particles of 
dust and freeze. Strong winds can suck the particles to elevations up to five 
miles, allowing them to grow as they rise until they are so heavy they fall as 
hailstones. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, at least, the exploding silver iodide packets cause the moisture to 
crystallize into countless tiny bits of ice that melt into harmless raindrops 
as they fall. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers around the world live in fear of hailstones that can pound their crops 
into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"A heavy storm can produce stones as big as an egg," noted Hans Scharpf, 
spokesman for the Swiss Hail Insurers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hailstorms are especially prevalent around mountain ranges such as the Alps, 
which block moving air masses and force them to dump precipitation on whatever 
lies below. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the threat, Swiss farmers have been firing silver iodide into clouds 
since the 18th Century, said Spoehel, a board member of the Swiss Assn. to 
Combat Hail. 
</P>
<P>
About 190 communities in the German and French-speaking parts of Switzerland 
are members of the association, and many help finance the hail-busting rockets, 
which cost about $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
Spoehel said his rockets have protected him from hail except for one time, when 
a storm front moved into the area so quickly that the rockets had no time to 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
A barometer hangs on the kitchen wall, but he gleans most of his weather 
information from his cable television, which broadcasts satellite pictures of 
Europe and regular updates on humidity, wind speed and air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers get their rockets from Hans Hamberger AG, a fireworks manufacturer 
that is Switzerland's sole supplier of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing chief Kurt Abegglin said Hamberger sells between 2,000 and 3,000 
each year, almost all to Swiss customers, although some go to Sweden and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
However, Scharpf of the Hail Insurers Assn. thinks the rockets provide more 
psychological than actual relief. He said most proponents take out large 
hail-insurance policies as well. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are farmers, and sometimes they have to watch a storm destroy 
their crops in the space of 10 minutes," he said. "That is a whole year's work 
just wiped out. They have to try everything they can. Whether it works or not 
is another question, but they have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Swiss hail insurers, who pay about $28 million annually for crop damage, helped 
finance a seven-year study by the Federal Institute of Technology that used 
large Soviet rockets to seed clouds, Scharpf said. 
</P>
<P>
"According to that experience, it had no effect whatsoever," he reported. 
"There was just as much damage done by storms where rockets were fired as there 
was when no rockets were fired."

THOSE WERE THE DAYS WHEN FOREIGNERS 'NEED NEVER WORRY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS'; 
</P>
<P>
BLEEDING BEIRUT WAS ONCE A COSMOPOLITAN HAVEN OF TOLERANCE AND JOY

An old guidebook says: "One thing a foreigner in Beirut need never worry about 
is making friends." That was long ago, before a civil war devastated the city 
and nation, before the hostage-taking. Here is a report on what it was like, by 
an Associated Press correspondent who lived in Beirut in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when Beirut was the playground of the Middle East, a vibrant 
crossroad between the Orient and the West. The bright Mediterranean sun glinted 
from its high-rise buildings and its vaults were full of oil money. 
</P>
<P>
Beirut was a stimulating intellectual center then, and a vital contact point 
for businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is a shambles strewn with garbage, a city brought low by 14 years of 
vicious civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who lived there remember Beirut before the war as a place where 
100,000 foreigners mingled with Middle Eastern princes, high-rollers, emigres, 
adventurers and 17 Christian and Muslim sects. 
</P>
<P>
A veneer of Western culture was superimposed on the fragile sectarian structure 
created by the French when they granted Lebanon independence in 1943. A dormant 
volcano of hatreds seethed beneath the exuberance and sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pine-Covered Mountains 
</P>
<P>
Luxury hotels, apartments and office blocks gleamed between the blue 
Mediterranean and pine-covered mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Lebanese Arabs, constrained at home by puritanical Muslim rules or 
dictators, could kick up their heels with liquor, women or $300 roulette chips 
and voice their political opinions freely in the Arab world's only working 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Westerners came to tap the oil money that poured into Beirut, buying into 
several dozen Lebanese banks or opening their own offices. 
</P>
<P>
Citibank of New York decorated a full floor of its office annex at the Holiday 
Inn with imported carpets and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, we watched from the Associated Press office nearby as it 
was looted and destroyed by rival militias battling for strategic high-rise 
buildings along what became the line dividing Christian and Muslim sectors of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cosmopolitan Society 
</P>
<P>
Westerners found Beirut intriguing for its combination of modern amenities with 
the Oriental flavor of the old gold market, its cosmopolitan society, the 
Middle Eastern food at such restaurants such as Ajami's. 
</P>
<P>
I still have a dusty, English-language guidebook, the last published before the 
war. "Everywhere you will feel the warm eastern hospitality," it says. "One 
thing a foreigner in Beirut need never worry about is making friends." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later, scores of foreigners have been kidnaped, most of them by 
virulently anti-Western Muslim groups. Sixteen still are held, including Terry 
Anderson, an AP colleague. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 Lebanese, most of them civilians, have been killed in the war 
and 1 million have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
Burned-out hulks of the St. Georges, Palm Beach, Phoenicia and Holiday Inn 
hotels cluster in what once was Beirut's tourist center and now is a wasteland 
inhabited only by snipers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Skiing, Speed Boats 
</P>
<P>
I recall sitting in the St. Georges restaurant in the good old days, watching 
water skiers skim behind needle-nosed Italian speedboats. 
</P>
<P>
There also was the less-costly, though fastidious, Myrtoum House restaurant and 
pension run by Hans Matschek, an Austrian expatriate. Regulars said it was the 
only place in Lebanon's sunny climate to risk eating steak tartare. 
</P>
<P>
An attraction at night was the great Casino de Liban, north of the city in what 
is now Christian territory, where one could gamble or watch two imported floor 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Those with the right connections might attend functions dominated by the 
doyenne of high society, Isabelle Soursock. She was from an old-money Lebanese 
Christian family and became Lady Isabelle when she married Sir Desmond 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
A vivid memory is of a visit to the home of Henri Pharaon, a bachelor shipping 
millionaire who lived among priceless Islamic art treasures and pictures of 
horses he raced against those of Saudi princes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Race Track Now a Ruin 
</P>
<P>
The race track on the city's dividing line is a ruin now, a nightmare scene of 
bullet-splintered trees and shell holes. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual establishment, even for Beirut, was the Surprise. It was the size of 
a packing crate and had a bartender, four stools, one hefty prostitute and a 
remarkable number of customers bidding for her favors. 
</P>
<P>
The American University of Beirut and large numbers of Arab intellectuals who 
fled persecution in their own countries gave the city a more serious side. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arab emigres contributed to the city more than the Lebanese socialites," 
said Charles Snow, an oil economist who spent many years in Beirut and moved to 
Cyprus in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The American University and medical school once had 5,000 students and produced 
a great share of the professional, academic and political leaders in the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graduate Become Hijacker 
</P>
<P>
Among the graduates was Dr. George Habash, whose Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine carried out airline hijackings in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-month-old artillery war between Syrian and Christian soldiers has forced 
the university to close temporarily. Several of its officials have been 
kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
Adjoining the park-like university campus was the American Community School, 
where children of expatriate families studied and played Little League 
baseball. Some tried the pinball machines at Anwar's, where many British and 
American boys, including my two sons, learned Arabic insults from local 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Beirutis could ski at Faraya on Mt. Lebanon, play tennis or squash and race in 
motor rallies. 
</P>
<P>
An American journalist who played at the Golf Club of Lebanon, next to the 
now-closed airport, as late as 1983 wrote that the safest places on the course 
were the sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
The luxurious Delamiyeh Country Club, with a gorgeous sea view from a ridge 
south of the city, was abandoned after Palestinian guerrillas took it over 
early in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Will the old Beirut ever return? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows, but I remember Khaled Saab, owner of Summerland, a functioning 
hotel built during the war. A television reporter asked why he made the 
investment, and Saab replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Did you, as a child, ever kick over an anthill? Did you see how quickly the 
ants rebuilt? That's Lebanon."

John F. Kennedy Jr. has been acquitted on a charge of driving an uninsured 
vehicle, the state Department of Motor Vehicles announced. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's attorney on Friday took evidence to the DMV that his client's car was 
insured when police ticketed him, a department spokesman said. The charge was 
dismissed, although the DMV has six months to verify the Kennedy documents. 
</P>
<P>
A charge of driving an unregistered car was put off until Sept. 29, which also 
is the deadline for Kennedy to pay a $127 fine on his guilty pleas to speeding 
and driving an uninspected vehicle.

TACOMA CLEAN-NEEDLE PROGRAM IS BACKED BY ADDICTS, OPPOSED BY OTHERS

<P>
Dave Purchase spends most afternoons trading gossip with a slow parade of drug 
addicts on a gritty downtown sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
But Purchase, a cheerful, engaging man, has something else to trade with the 
drug users he calls "just folks" and counts among his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"How ya doin', Pumpkin?" he asked a woman with haunted eyes as he handed her a 
clean hypodermic needle for the used one she dropped into a little red box 
sitting on a folding table. "Not too bad," she said with a tired smile. 
</P>
<P>
"That's great," Purchase boomed. "That's great." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brings in Pair of Needles 
</P>
<P>
A woman with a headful of tiny black braids brought Purchase a pair of needles 
she had used to feed a heroin habit. She lingered in the feeble sunshine with 
fellow junkies to watch the action. Down the street, a squad car screeched to a 
stop and a policeman alighted to drag a fallen-down drunk to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"I shoot heroin . . . I'm a dope fiend," the woman with braids said to a 
visitor. "But I come down here most every day for clean needles. I like the 
high, man, but I don't want to die for it. I don't want no AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Stephanie, talked of enrolling 
in a treatment program to kick her 10-year habit. She pointed at Purchase. "The 
rig man there -- he cares what happens to us." 
</P>
<P>
In this neighborhood of half-abandoned buildings, sagging fences and 
weed-choked lots, Purchase and his crew of county health workers have built 
what is hailed as the nation's first successful program to reduce the number of 
dirty needles among drug addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cities Adopt Plan 
</P>
<P>
The program, which swaps 1,500 clean needles for dirty ones a week, is being 
studied or at least partly duplicated in places like Honolulu, Boulder, Colo., 
and San Francisco. Observers are impressed by an unexpected bonus: new access 
to elusive inner-city addicts and a chance to help break their habits. 
</P>
<P>
Critics include Bush Administration officials, who say backers of such programs 
have yet to show that they slow the spread of AIDS. State lawmakers and some 
treatment experts say Tacoma's program not only violates the state's drug 
paraphernalia law but that it tacitly sanctions illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"To put up a little table to exchange needles like Mr. Purchase does is like 
Alcoholics Anonymous' putting up a bar on the sidewalk and giving out free 
drinks while passing out pamphlets against drunk driving," said the Rev. Joe 
Ellis, whose Tacoma Rescue Mission is just up the street from where Purchase 
hands out needles every afternoon but Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase has little patience for critics like Ellis. "You know what these 
people are really saying? They are saying, 'Let 'em die.' Either that or they 
haven't seen the evidence that needle-sharing is spreading AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began as Personal War 
</P>
<P>
Purchase, 49, a former drug counselor, received local government funding and a 
staff in January after starting the program with his own money a year ago as a 
personal war on the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The $45,000 program's purpose is simple, he said. "If you want to slow the 
spread of AIDS, you have to slow the spread through dirty needles." Sharing of 
needles has surpassed homosexual contact as a cause of AIDS' spread. 
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug users account for 27% of all AIDS cases nationally; as of 
mid-July, 99,936 Americans had contracted the disease and 58,014 of those had 
died. In Washington state, 1,383 AIDS cases have been reported and 753 of them 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase's war on dirty needles has drawn applause in the sad underground of 
street addicts and among many health officials. But he is quick to note that he 
would be out of business if authorities decided to enforce a misdemeanor state 
law against delivering or possessing syringes without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permitted to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma officials have permitted the program to continue because "these people 
are not trying to commit criminal acts" but rather are waging a war on AIDS, 
Tom Felnagle, chief criminal deputy prosecutor for Pierce County, said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase, a drug counselor for 20 years, said he owes addicts a great deal, 
which is why he contracted with a medical supply house a year ago to distribute 
needles himself, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in the business since 1969. These people paid my mortgage, put food 
on my table; I mean I've been living off their misery for 20 years like any 
decent social worker. I decided to do something for them." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Al Allen, the county health director, is excited by the new bridge to this 
industrial port city's most elusive underclass -- longtime IV drug users. "You 
do have to go to people you might not feel comfortable with, on their terms, 
and be willing to wash their feet, so to speak, if you want to reach them." 
</P>
<P>
Working out of a van, Purchase and his crew hand out condoms also, as well as 
little bottles of bleach to clean needles -- and blueberry muffins. A health 
worker is always with them, ready to offer counseling and other help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needle-Sharing Declines 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they have found a "substantial decrease" in needle sharing 
as a result of the program and have referred more than 150 addicts to treatment 
programs after Purchase and his crew cultivated a relationship with them. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents like Ellis and state lawmaker Charles Wolfe, a Spokane physician who 
failed this year to obtain passage of legislation against needle exchanges, 
note that backers have not demonstrated that the program slows the spread of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Ellis asserts, the program is unnecessary because AIDS among local IV 
drug users is nowhere near as bad as in New York City and elsewhere. "They are 
using East Coast statistics to justify the idea here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He bristled at the suggestion that he would just as soon let AIDS victims die. 
"We spend over $2 million a year on drug and alcohol programs. Does that sound 
like somebody who wants to let them die?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proof May Take Years 
</P>
<P>
Another heath department spokesman, Terry Reid, said it is unfair to expect the 
program to demonstrate in less than several years that it slows the spread of 
AIDS. "How can you demonstrate success a year after the program starts when the 
incubation period for the disease is about seven years?" 
</P>
<P>
Purchase puts it another way: "If we're wrong, then we wasted a few cents a 
needle. If we're right, we saved a lot of lives." 
</P>
<P>
As a steady stream of addicts stopped at Purchase's table, Stephanie leaned 
against a wall and explained addicts' willingness to use the program: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to give our name. We don't have to do nothin' but bring the rig 
man a dirty needle for a clean one, and the cops don't bother us. It's easy, 
and I think it's workin'. Hey, dope fiends aren't sharin' their needles like 
they used to, 'cause they can get clean ones without a lot of problems."

PALOMAR COLLEGE IS UNFAZED, UPBEAT ABOUT COMPETITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You might expect Palomar Community College to be looking nervously over its 
shoulder these days, not sure what effect the opening of a state university in 
San Marcos will have on it. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar College, after all, has been the granddaddy of public higher education 
in North County, albeit primarily for college-level freshmen and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Cal State San Marcos is moving from paper to reality and is 
building a new campus just a couple of miles away, might Palomar be relegated 
to some lesser position, rejuvenating the old stigma of being a "junior 
college," a "high school with ashtrays"? 
</P>
<P>
Will North County's graduating high school seniors look to the new university 
with a gleam in their eyes? Sure, Palomar has been the convenient way station 
for lower-division students who looked to finish their studies elsewhere in the 
pursuit of a four-year degree. But now that there's the university opening in 
town, why not go directly to Cal State San Marcos for the entire scholastic 
stint? 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Palomar College sees no need to retrench. Here's a college where 
enrollment this fall -- classes start Monday -- is expected to exceed 24,000. 
Here's a college that has satellite centers from Camp Pendleton to Borrego 
Springs to Rancho Penasquitos, and is negotiating to open its largest satellite 
center yet, in a one-time catalogue showroom fewer than 10 miles away in 
Escondido, to better accommodate its exploding enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a college that, like some discount department store selling everything 
from toys to tires to televisions, offers a one-day session titled "Fabulous 
Freebies and Bargains in America's Finest City," a 13-week course on 
early-American rug hooking and a semester-long class on electron microscopy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full-Service Program 
</P>
<P>
Palomar's curriculum mirrors the mission statement for California's system of 
community colleges: Offer something for everyone, inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
By law, community colleges have to admit into their classrooms anyone who is 18 
years old. There are no entrance exams, no Scholastic Aptitude Tests. You don't 
even need a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
Community colleges are part of California's three-tiered system for public 
higher education. The University of California system has the strictest 
enrollment standards and offers doctorates as the pinnacle of academic 
achievement. The CSU campuses are the second tier, with more lenient 
</P>
<P>
qualifications for enrollment and offering bachelor's and master's degrees. 
Then there are the community colleges, which accept anyone and offer only 
certificates (for vocational trades) and associate in arts degrees for those 
who have completed the equivalent of lower-division college work. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, community colleges have a rap in some circles for catering to 
students who wouldn't cut the mustard at a four-year college and who saw the 
community college as a chance to learn, at least, how to work on an automotive 
engine or handle a wood lathe to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But then, figure this. A statistical survey by the CSU chancellor's 
office shows that Palomar College students who transferred to a state 
university earned a grade-point average of 2.74 out of a possible 4.0 in their 
junior year at the university. By comparison, students who enrolled as freshmen 
at the state universities had an overall grade-point average of 2.63 at the end 
of their junior year. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics suggest that Palomar does a better job of preparing students for 
upper-division work than do the state universities themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Couple that fact with the cost of going to a community college, and Palomar's 
staff and faculty think they have an appeal that can't be beat. A full-time 
student at a community college will pay $100 in fees for two semesters. The 
same student will pay $976 in fees to attend San Diego State University, and 
$1,767 to attend UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of parents out there -- yuppies who maybe are UC- or 
Stanford-educated -- who don't think Palomar is the place for their children," 
said Cynthia Poole, who heads Palomar's counseling office. "But when we go out 
to the high schools in the spring and talk to seniors and their parents, a lot 
of them are overjoyed by what they hear about Palomar -- the cost, and our 
achievements." 
</P>
<P>
That basic spiel is for graduating seniors to spend their first two years of 
college at Palomar, pay only $200 in fees, take the same core curriculum, 
general education courses that would be offered to lower-division students at a 
four-year college -- courses whose units are transferable to the university -- 
and then decide where to go for upper-division work. By that time, the student 
will be able to better select a university to fit his interests. 
</P>
<P>
"A student might start off at San Diego State for his first two years, pay the 
fees, and then decide he wants to go into forestry -- something that's not 
offered at San Diego State. He'll have to transfer anyway," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Palomar graduate wants to transfer to UCSD, he's got an inside track. 
Under an agreement between UCSD and Palomar, lower-division students who end up 
with at least a 2.4 grade-point average (roughly a C+) in a prescribed set of 
university-quality courses are guaranteed admission as juniors to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stacy, president of Cal State San Marcos, said a similar arrangement will 
be offered between the new university and Palomar, so the two campuses will be 
seen as cousins, not competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already got a lot of respect for Palomar," said Stacy, a one-time speech 
instructor who came from Southeast Missouri State University to be president of 
Cal State San Marcos two months ago. 
</P>

"I can remember being a debate coach and going to a competition at Pepperdine. 
Palomar was there, too, and they really beat up on some schools from the Big 
Ten. They've been darned good in intercollegiate debate, even against full, 
four-year universities." 
</P>
<P>
Palomar has received national notice, too, for its renowned nursing education 
program, Stacy said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a Cal State campus to be the best at what you do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy and his Palomar counterpart, George Boggs, said they expect in the years 
ahead to share students who will attend both schools concurrently, depending on 
how their class and work schedules mesh. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see students attend both places, rather than exclusively one or 
the other," said Boggs, as noteworthy for his soft-spoken ways as he is for his 
cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some work to do, to figure what courses we'll provide to feed into 
their majors," he said. "But I also expect they'll be sending students over 
here for courses that will be preparatory to their majors -- classes that maybe 
we can offer at more convenient times, with good instructors and at reasonable 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs conceded that he was concerned, when Cal State San Marcos was on the 
drawing boards, that the new university would drain students who otherwise 
would attend Palomar. For that reason, Boggs was one of those who recommended 
-- and state officials agreed -- that Cal State San Marcos not enroll freshmen 
and sophomores until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apprehension Relaxed 
</P>
<P>
But Boggs has since rethought his position, reflecting on his days as an 
instructor and administrator at Butte Community College, not far from Cal State 
Chico. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that Chico brought a lot of students into the region and that, once 
there, a lot of those students enrolled at Butte as well. There's a certain 
synergism that we expect to experience here, as well." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Palomar is continuing to grow rapidly, despite a slump in 
enrollment in the early 1980s, experienced throughout California's 106 
community colleges, brought on in part by an expiration of GI Bill benefits and 
the institution of fees, however modest. 
</P>
<P>
At Palomar, enrollment dipped from 20,000 to 15,000. By the end of the coming 
school year, Palomar might eclipse 25,000 students, Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
The average student at Palomar is 30 years old; there are more women than men 
on campus. Only about 16% of the students come directly to Palomar from high 
school; conversely, about 6% of the students are 65 or older -- drawn by such 
courses as "Be Alive as Long as You Live." 
</P>
<P>
Most students are returning to school after several years' absence from a 
classroom. Many are retired military personnel; many are women leaving the home 
front for the first time because they need to enter the work force. Others are 
simply in pursuit of personal enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
As many students take night courses as day courses. Two-thirds of the students 
attend part time; the typical student who gets his A.A. degree from Palomar has 
taken 5 1/2 years to finish work that could be accomplished full-time in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10% of Palomar's students already have bachelor's degrees and have 
returned to Palomar to further their education in different areas, or for 
specialized work. Last year, counselor Poole said, three students with doctoral 
degrees returned to Palomar so they could get their A.A. degrees, which, in 
their professions, meant pay bonuses because it was yet another academic degree 
to add to their scholastic pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
58 Degrees Available 
</P>
<P>
All told, Palomar offers 58 A.A. degrees, in subjects from accounting to 
welding technology. But campus boosters say Palomar's contribution to the 
community goes beyond the campus setting, which is filled to the brim and 
which, on weekday mid-mornings, finds every available classroom occupied. 
</P>
<P>
A full 30% of Palomar's students don't even go to the campus; they attend 
courses at the seven satellite centers, including 3,000 students who attend 
Palomar classes in the evening at Mt. Carmel High School in Rancho Penasquitos. 
One student recently earned her A.A. degree from Palomar without ever stepping 
foot on the main campus in San Marcos until graduation day. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a 2,500-square-mile service area," said Bill Flynn, dean of community 
education. "A lot of people can't get to us, so we try to get to them." 
</P>
<P>
Like other community colleges, Palomar is able to quickly put together 
special-interest courses to meet specific requests. When someone complained 
about trouble in mastering his home video camera, Palomar put together a 
special, one-day course on the subject, taught by the college's television 
production instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"We might get a call from a local industry saying they want a specific course 
for their management staff in, say, business communications," Flynn said. "So 
we'll tailor-make the package to meet the needs of that company, find an 
appropriate instructor, and offer it to them when they want it, where they want 
it and cost it out so it's competitive to the private marketplace. It may not 
be a college credit course, but it meets their specific needs." 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of logic that led Palomar to offer, for instance, three 
separate three-session courses on how to master the tricky computer 
word-processing software "WordPerfect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Just Campus Life 
</P>
<P>
Palomar's resources go beyond the classroom. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Its 44,000-square-foot, three-story library, housing a collection of nearly 
120,000 books and more than 900 periodicals and papers, making it the largest 
research library in North County. The library is open to the public, and about 
4,000 non-student residents hold library cards. 
</P>
<P>
* Its 47-acre hiking-trail system, featuring an 8-acre landscaped arboretum 
with more than 500 types of trees, shrubs, flowers and grasses. A separate 
cactus garden is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
* Its acclaimed Boehm Art Gallery, where the works of younger contemporary 
artists have won critical exposure that has landed them more prominent showings 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* Its planetarium, which offers free public shows and lectures on Wednesday 
nights, and is available for special shows and elementary school field trips so 
children can view a re-creation of the night sky projected onto its domed 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
* A Buckminster Fuller-inspired geodesic dome, built in 1958, which houses 
3,000 people for unbroken views of concerts, speakers, graduation ceremonies 
and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
* A 400-seat performing arts theater and discussion, in conjunction with the 
city of San Marcos, which has $700,000 burning a hole in its pocket -- for a 
community amphitheater in a hillside bowl on the campus' back side. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Palomar College was out on its own, doing as it pleased, ignoring 
the city and itself ignored by the city," said San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau. 
"The college seemed to complicate all our problems, especially with traffic." 
</P>
<P>
"But things have turned around in the past few years -- maybe the coming of the 
new university had something to do with that," Thibadeau said. "The 
amphitheater is an example of that. We've been looking for a site for years, 
but, quite frankly, we never looked to the college for help, and they never 
offered. But now they've come to us with a proposal: They'll offer the space, 
and we would pay to develop, maintain and operate it. There's a new spirit of 
cooperation between the two of us." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, who joined Palomar in 1985, is also credited with smoothing what had 
been a rocky relationship between the faculty and staff with the former 
administration. Boggs, a chemist by background, said his first marching orders 
from college trustees were to "heal wounds" between the administration and the 
college's employees, brought on by growing distrust between the two in earlier 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Palomar's faculty still is not represented by a collective bargaining 
unit, preferring instead to delegate faculty members to meet with the president 
in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If Boggs has been embroiled in any controversy, it may well have been his 
decision to give coaches a stipend for their work, over and above the pay they 
receive as instructors, even though some of their instructional time is 
reassigned to coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
A faculty and staff task force formed by Boggs recommended to him that the 
coaches not receive an additional stipend, but he nonetheless recommended the 
stipend to the college's trustees, and they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems at a Minimum 
</P>
<P>
"There's some concern on campus that George might have violated the 
collegiality that has worked pretty well since he came here," said one longtime 
faculty member. "But still, in my meetings with other community college faculty 
members around the state, it sounds like we've got the fewest problems of any 
in terms of working with our administration." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs deflects the criticism that he is less open to faculty and staff 
participation than he once was. 
</P>
<P>
"Collegiality means the administration and the board have an obligation to take 
seriously the recommendations of our task forces and committees," he said. "But 
that doesn't necessarily mean you don't still disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it appears that morale on campus is healthy, especially among the 
faculty, if not the students who will begin the daily scramble for parking 
spaces Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here because we want to teach, and we're allowed to teach," said Pat 
Schwerdtfeger, president of the faculty senate and an instructor of speech and 
religious studies. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty at (San Diego) State and UCSD generally have larger classes. Many 
of them are taught by graduate assistants, and the professors are often 
focusing on research and on getting published," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, I can teach. I've got 25 to 30 students in a class, and I can 
actually get to know them personally. They've got my full attention. It's fun 
for them, and it's fun for me."

BALLOT BACKSLIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The League of Women Voters was very disappointed with the San Diego City 
Council's refusal to place the recommendations of the Charter Review Commission 
before the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
While individual council members may not agree with the commission's proposed 
Charter amendments, the City Council did "declare(s) that all recommendations 
made by the commission shall be placed directly on the ballot without further 
council directive." Shouldn't council members feel obligated to honor that 
promise made in 1988? Perhaps that promise was foolishly given, but it was 
given, and the council should accept the responsibility for that action. 
</P>
<P>
The voters should decide if the city's charter should be changed in accordance 
with the commission's recommendations. The voters decided they wanted district 
elections. Perhaps a majority of voters also believes the time is past due to 
expand the number of districts from eight to 10. Perhaps the voters will decide 
that the nonpartisan nature of electing the mayor and council members will be 
protected by creating a redistricting commission to redraw council districts. 
The League of Women Voters trusts the electorate. We would like to see the City 
Council exhibit trust in the voters also. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council did vote to reconsider the 13 recommendations later this 
summer. Time grows short to meet that commitment.

GROWTH IS REAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big shoot-out over the issue of secondary treatment for San Diego sewage, 
between the Environmental Protection Agency and the group of present and former 
Scripps scientists put together by City Councilman Bruce Henderson has taken 
place at the OK Corral, and the outcome was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA had all the big guns, and Henderson's scientists were shooting blanks. 
No relevant facts were produced by them to justify not converting to secondary 
treatment as required by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they were polite in not admitting it, it was perfectly obvious 
that the representatives from the EPA had heard this same bellyaching a hundred 
times before from other pollution generators. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a scientist to know that the Earth is a finite environment. You 
can't continue to add more and more pollution to it without ultimately serious 
consequences, and you cannot continue to grow as San Diego has without 
generating more pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's group of scientists were able to come up with only one valid point 
in their arguments: Removal of more sludge from the sewage, if San Diego 
continues to grow at its present rate, will create problems of disposal. The 
key phrase here is continued growth. Is it too much to hope for that Mr. 
Henderson might now consider resigning his membership in the pro-growth 
majority bloc on the City Council? Yes, it probably is. 
</P>
<P>
The $2 billion or $3 billion that San Diego will have to pay to correct this 
sewage discharge problem is only a down payment on the debt which it has 
accumulated over the past years during its pro-growth frenzy. Other problems at 
least as large (and still awaiting a final price tag) are solid waste disposal, 
traffic congestion, water shortages, pollution of streams and wetlands, air 
pollution, crime, schools, and supplementation or replacement of capital 
facilities -- all problems caused by growth. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it is we, the citizens of San Diego, who will ultimately have to 
pay for the mistakes made by this and former city councils. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that San Diego, and every pollution-generating group, has the moral 
obligation to limit its polluting effluent to a fixed amount. The only way this 
can be done is to ensure that the increasing amount of sewage which you 
discharge is cleaner. The oceans are a big place to hide a pollution problem, 
but ultimately they are not that big. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that San Diego will live up to EPA's standards and not have to be 
dragged, kicking and screaming, into a hopefully environmentally cleaner 21st 
Century.

YAF OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why does The Times devote so much space to groups like Young Americans for 
Freedom, whose "tactics, beliefs teeter on the edge of respectability" (Aug. 
12)? Their "desire to make a difference" results in xenophobia and the 
systematic suppression of difference. Comparing YAFers to '60s civil rights 
activists and lauding their "passionate idealism" is certainly an attempt to 
boost their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Anthony Perry ("YAFers Put Song in Their Heart," Aug. 14), ever 
ready to print anti-gay sentiment in his column? AIDS is not a laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
Why does The Times neglect groups representing opposing viewpoints, such as 
YAF's self-proclaimed adversary, lesbian leftists? Or are we perceived as over 
the edge of respectability? If working to end poverty, homelessness, 
environmental destruction, nuclear proliferation, obscene levels of defense 
spending and discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, age, religion 
or sexual orientation is viewed as unacceptable, then count me in.

</P>
<P>
FIRING AFTER DISPUTED POLLUTION SERIES ADDS TO CONTROVERSY IN SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story had enough drama and intrigue to bring an investigative journalist's 
blood to a boil: illegally dumped toxic waste, four members of a family living 
nearby wiped out by unexplained cancers and what appeared to be a cover-up 
involving some of a boom town's most prominent citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Done well, the story would almost certainly result in prizes. And reporters at 
Santa Clarita's 44,000-circulation Newhall Signal -- young and inexperienced 
but encouraged by an editor who boasted nearly 90 awards during a long career 
of investigative reporting at metropolitan newspapers -- knew they were 
pursuing a big story. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Cook, the editor, said he admonished his young staff to go to any length 
to make the story accurate. Remember, he said he told them, those involved will 
try to blame the messenger. Don't give them any ammunition. Don't make 
mistakes. Don't back down. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the advice, the spotlight of public scrutiny shifted to the Signal and 
Cook after publication of a series of stories in June alleging that chemical 
wastes, dumped before 1984 by Space Ordnance Systems, a Sand Canyon defense 
contractor, caused the deaths of four members of the Robert Hercules family. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month later, Cook was fired. He blames leading citizens, who were 
among those criticized in the articles for not aggressively investigating 
health effects of the toxic wastes, for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was removed basically because five civic leaders went to the publisher and 
general manager of the paper and said that the stories . . . were not, in their 
opinion, good community journalism," Cook said in an appearance on a Los 
Angeles radio call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
The stories, and Cook's dismissal, ignited a many-sided debate that has 
continued in Santa Clarita all summer. Residents have argued over the stories' 
accuracy, the role of political leaders in the editor's departure and the 
nature of community journalism in a rapidly growing city with a population of 
150,000. Meanwhile, real estate agents and other community leaders have sought 
to calm residents' fears by convening panels of experts to discount health 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders Complained 
</P>
<P>
A coterie of leading Santa Clarita citizens -- including City Council member 
and past mayor Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, present Mayor Jan Heidt, Mayor Pro Tem 
Jo Anne Darcy, and Planning Commissioners Rita Garasi and Connie Worden -- 
acknowledged that they complained to the newspaper. They said that the series 
was sensational and that facts and events were stated out of context. 
</P>
<P>
"We were dismayed," Worden said of the six stories, 16 photos and several 
graphics that the Signal spread across four pages. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said she was shocked. "It made it look like we were hiding something, and 
we weren't," she said. "It made me very resentful, and I called the newspaper . 
. . and said it wasn't accurate." 
</P>
<P>
All said, however, that they did not ask the newspaper's management to fire 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Publisher Darell Phillips acknowledged that he was influenced by the 
community leaders' criticism. He stressed, however, that Cook's departure was 
caused mostly by "philosophical differences" related to the proper functioning 
of a community newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips wrote a lengthy column earlier this month explaining the episode. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were guilty . . . in certain cases, of not fairly presenting both 
sides of an issue," Phillips wrote. He said some of Cook's editorial decisions 
were "totally irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he wrote that the Signal, under Cook, had committed a sin of which 
big-city newspapers are frequently said to be guilty: "There was a general 
perception that we were much more ambitious with a negative story than a 
positive one." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Phillips said he was aware of Cook's long record of 
hard-hitting investigative reporting when he recruited him in September from 
the Arizona Republic in Phoenix. He said the Signal needed an editor who could 
keep the newspaper in the public eye, the way that colorful editor Scott 
Newhall had for 25 years until he left in 1988 in a stock dispute. 
</P>
<P>
With competing newspapers pursuing the rapidly growing area's rich advertising 
and circulation markets, the Signal's new owner, Morris Newspaper Corp., wanted 
it to remain distinct. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Phillips gave him the authority to go after serious stories, and 
investigative articles about unsafe school buses, improper handling of 911 
calls and unattended asbestos problems ensued. The paper's stories often were 
chased by competing newspapers and stirred controversy. Cook said he was never 
told to soften the tone of the newspaper's reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the day they asked me to leave, I was hearing nothing but 'atta-boys' 
and 'way to go,' " Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glowing Recommendation 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cook's severance report rates his performance as excellent in four of 
five categories and good in a fifth. Phillips also wrote Cook a glowing letter 
of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The Space Ordnance Systems stories were approved before publication by Signal 
General Manager Sammee Zeile. Even after they became controversial, Cook said, 
neither Zeile nor Phillips asked him or his staff to account for the 
conclusions in the articles. 
</P>
<P>
Cook acknowledges that the SOS stories stretched his seven-person reporting 
staff -- that he was attempting major league journalism with minor league 
reporters. But he said he felt compelled to do the story, which he continues to 
defend. 
</P>
<P>
"The story was well-done," he said. "My concern as an editor was that we handle 
this responsibly and not to go overboard, and to err on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
But the stories' critics said the newspaper was anything but cautious. While 
downplaying the nearly completed cleanup, the stories seized upon a 5-year-old 
dumping incident that involved highly diluted toxic chemicals. Even though 
state and county experts had found that the chemicals posed little health risk, 
the Signal reported allegations that they caused the deaths in the Hercules 
family, who lived in Sand Canyon from 1978 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also said the stories never suggested how the family could have been 
exposed to the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on an informal survey by a housewife, the newspaper said cancer rates 
in the Sand Canyon area were three to eight times national averages. But a 1988 
state study of the area found that, on the contrary, cancer rates were below 
state and county averages. 
</P>
<P>
The Signal's stories severely criticized members of a citizens committee who 
had recommended that the study not be done. But the stories failed to mention 
the results of the study, or even that it had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Opinions 
</P>
<P>
The series relied heavily on the Hercules family's opinions, as well as on 
those of other residents among the nine families suing SOS for allegedly 
causing them to become sick. 
</P>
<P>
The series also accused public officials of being allied with polluters, which 
galled the city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It came across like we had some small-town, big-time conspiracy going here," 
said McKeon, Santa Clarita's first mayor who, like Heidt and Garasi, lives in 
Sand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we . . . knew of some big health problem and were covering it up 
to protect our property values, which doesn't make sense because we all live 
there still. We drink the same water. We breathe the same air." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jan Heidt said she was stunned by the Signal's allegations that she and 
others -- who had volunteered to serve on committees to assess the hazards 
posed by the dumping and to monitor its cleanup -- acted irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always considered it to be one of the finest things . . . I was involved 
in," she said. "You assess . . . the situation, and you take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
Heidt said the same can-do attitude and willingness to volunteer helped build 
the city's hospital and a boys club and to win its 1987 incorporation effort. 
"Every community has its skeletons," she said of the dumping incident. 
</P>
<P>
When state and county health officials and Los Angeles sheriff's deputies 
raided the SOS plants in March, 1984, in Sand Canyon, near Canyon Country, and 
in Mint Canyon, near Agua Dulce, they discovered that the company sprayed toxic 
waste water into the air and dumped it into the ground. Tests found trace 
levels of benzene, trichloroethylene and other chemicals in nearby wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2.2-Million Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of citizens, the company agreed to a $2.2-million cleanup. A 
committee was formed to monitor its performance. 
</P>
<P>
Three SOS executives pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges and served brief 
jail terms in 1986. The company paid $300,000 in fines. Tons of contaminated 
soil were removed. Wells were installed to remove tainted ground water. And 
tests of ground and drinking water continue today. 
</P>
<P>
The Signal's stories hinged on allegations by Marilyn Hercules that SOS dumping 
was responsible for four deaths in the family. Robert Hercules, her husband, 
died in February of kidney cancer at 40; his twin stepdaughters from his first 
marriage died of leukemia, one in 1986 at 20 and the other in June at 23, and 
his stepson died in 1983 at 20, also of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The cluster of deaths remains a mystery. Some experts have suggested that 
Robert Hercules' first wife, Diane, who died in 1984 at the age of 38 of a 
lengthy immune system disorder, might have carried a virus that predisposed her 
three children to cancer. Neighbors said they remembered that Robert Hercules 
used various solvents in his car repair business. 
</P>
<P>
But experts, who were asked to respond to the Signal's stories by Santa Clarita 
city officials, said they were certain that the SOS wastes could not have 
caused the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the family had been exposed, concentration levels were too low to cause 
the cancers, said Dr. Paul Papanek, chief of the county Department of Health 
Services' toxic epidemiology program. He said exposure to secondhand cigarette 
smoke is at least 100 times as dangerous as drinking the most severely 
contaminated water at the SOS site. 
</P>
<P>
Since the stories' publication, state and county epidemiology experts have 
re-examined cancer cases in the area and reaffirmed earlier findings that 
cancer rates are average or below average. 
</P>
<P>
The experts said their methods were not foolproof but were the best available 
without conducting an expensive 20-year, house-to-house survey. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Garasi, also a member of the citizens monitoring committee, said the 
Signal's stories caused residents to again experience the anguish they felt in 
1984 when the toxic wastes were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to where we started in terms of the concerns . . . but not in terms 
of the pollution," she said. "You can clean up toxics, but I don't know how you 
clean up bad journalism." 
</P>
<P>
A former colleague described Chuck Cook -- 6-foot-5, 250 pounds and bearded -- 
as "a bear of a man and a bear of a worker." 
</P>
<P>
Some fellow journalists praised him as an inspired, extraordinarily committed 
journalist bursting with brilliant ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same journalists also said that in his zeal to produce 
award-winning, blockbuster stories, Cook, 44, has more than once unnerved 
colleagues with his news-gathering techniques. But several others praised his 
diligence and ability to dig up information. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a guy you loved or you hated," said Eric Miller, an investigative 
reporter at the Arizona Republic who also worked with Cook at the Dallas 
Morning News. "I don't think he tried to be mean. It's just that he was such a 
hard-charger." 
</P>
<P>
As a journalist, "Chuck is go for broke, let's get it done, get it in the 
paper," said Jim Carlton, a Los Angeles Times reporter whom Cook hired for his 
first journalism job in Port Arthur, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Although many journalists change jobs often, Cook has perhaps been more nomadic 
than most during his 24-year career, working for five newspapers during the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised by what happened in Newhall," said Carlton, who has been 
friends with Cook for 11 years. "It takes him only a few months to find the 
most sensitive nerve in town and expose it. That's why he has to move so 
often." 
</P>
<P>
An ex-colleague at the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, where Cook was a key figure 
in the newspaper's 1986 award-winning coverage of problems with the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District bus system, said Cook suggested several 
information-gathering gambits that resulted in breakthroughs in the newspaper's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories that resulted were criticized as misleading by the RTD. For 
example, the newspaper stated that one in eight, or 12.5%, of RTD drivers had 
outstanding traffic warrants, suspended or expired licenses or no license at 
all. A month later, the RTD responded that its own survey found that fewer than 
1% of its drivers had such problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he relied on state Department of Motor Vehicles records for the RTD 
story, which "performed a helluva important public service for Los Angeles 
transit riders." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is never reckless. "I go to great lengths to document a story," he 
said. "I realize that each story I print affects people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's reporting, which has twice made him a finalist for the coveted Pulitzer 
Prize, has occasionally put him in danger. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had a gun pulled on him by a drunken source in east Texas and has 
received numerous death threats. Newspapers where he has worked, including the 
Signal, have received bomb threats from callers demanding that he stop pursuing 
a story, he said. He has a suit pending against the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department, alleging that it hired an undercover agent to discredit him and his 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who's aggressive evokes different reactions," Cook said. He said one 
of his few regrets about his experience in Santa Clarita is that "dedicated 
young journalists" who looked up to him will be discouraged from being 
"aggressive and asking the extra question." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hercules took his story to the Signal in November. After he died in 
February, Marilyn Hercules called the Signal and the newspaper revived its 
investigation. Eventually, three reporters -- two of whom quit before the 
stories were published -- scoured monitoring committee records and county 
Department of Health Services documents. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the reporters interviewed all the parties involved and reviewed 
pending lawsuits. He said the Signal decided to publish the story even though 
prominent citizens urged it not to. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Hercules said the Signal "did a very fine job of presenting the facts." 
She said she found Cook's dismissal "absolutely appalling." 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis Ostrom, president of the Sand Canyon Homeowners Assn., disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main focus is to provide the real data to the recent arrivals . . . in the 
Sand Canyon area," he said. Residents who read the Signal's stories got "the 
impression that there continues to be a health threat." 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Connie Worden, chairwoman of the toxics monitoring 
committee, said the stories and their aftermath demonstrate that the 
responsibilities of a community newspaper are different from those of a 
metropolitan newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"A community newspaper . . . is looked on with far more significance in a 
small, insular community. . . ," she said. "It plays the role of leading the 
way, of providing leadership." She said Cook failed that test. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is looking for a job, disagrees. He said Santa Clarita's leading 
citizens want a small-town newspaper they can control, and he was beyond their 
reach.

BEVERLY SEEKS EXEMPTION TO CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bill carried by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) cleared its first 
legislative hurdle last week despite complaints from critics that it would 
undermine state conflict-of-interest regulations for public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under state Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, local officials 
automatically must disqualify themselves from voting on any development within 
300 feet of real estate they own, including their homes, because of the 
potential for a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sought by the city of Signal Hill, would exempt a public 
official's principal residence from conflict-of-interest requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Governmental Organization Committee approved the measure Tuesday on 
an 8-0 vote and sent it to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Fair Political Practices Commission opposed the legislation as 
too broadly drawn and said it could lead to other changes in the 
conflict-of-interest statutes. Lilly Spitz, a commission lawyer, described the 
potential impact of the bill as "like setting a toe into some quicksand." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly introduced the bill on Monday. With only four weeks remaining in the 
1989 legislative session, it is unclear whether Beverly will have the time to 
maneuver the measure through the legislative process. Because the bill would 
amend the state Political Reform Act and Beverly wants it to take effect 
immediately, all action will require a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, whose district covers Signal Hill, said he is pushing the proposal 
partly to spur the commission to reach a compromise with the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Add 1,300 Units to City 
</P>
<P>
He said that three of Signal Hill's five council members and two of its 
planning commissioners live near two proposed developments, which would add 
1,300 residential units to the city. 
</P>
<P>
These officials are prohibited from voting on any item affecting these 
developments because of regulations issued last year by the political watchdog 
agency, Beverly said. "Merely by virtue of your residence . . . you should not 
be guilty of a conflict of interest," Beverly told the committee. Because the 
two-square-mile hillside city lies in the middle of an oil field, much of its 
land is undeveloped. The housing developments would take up the bulk of the 
remaining vacant land in the city of 8,400. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Political Practices Commission Chairman John Larson told the committee 
that the commission has spelled out procedures for cities to handle such 
extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Signal Hill City Council may conduct a random drawing among the 
trio of council members who were disqualified. Along with the remaining two 
members, the person whose name is drawn would make up a quorum of the council 
to review the development projects, according to an analysis of the bill by the 
Governmental Organization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee analysis of the bill, Signal Hill officials say that 
other communities are also penalized by the regulations "because it is 
difficult for a locally elected official to avoid conflicts no matter where he 
resides in the city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had to Disqualify Selves 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the FPPC determined that three planning commissioners and two 
council members in Monterey Park had to disqualify themselves from major zoning 
changes because their homes fell within areas under review or in close 
proximity to them. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said he was in sympathy with Signal Hill's dilemma, but he maintained 
that the dispute could be resolved through changes in his commission's 
regulations or through a narrowly tailored bill to lift conflict-of-interest 
restrictions for officials in small cities like Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"The smaller cities do pose a problem," he acknowledged, noting that the Signal 
Hill situation was unique because a majority of the council faces a potential 
conflict.

BAHRAIN TRYING TO HALT DECIMATION OF PALM TREES

<P>
The government is trying to halt an alarming decline in palm trees on the 
Persian Gulf island state in recent decades, a government official says. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed bin Abdul-Wahab al Khalifa, director of research for the 
Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, said last week that in the last 30 to 40 
years the number of Bahrain's palm trees has dwindled from about 1 million to a 
little more than 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, a U.S.-educated prince in Bahrain's ruling family, blamed the decline 
on widespread urbanization, the increasing salinity of underground reservoirs 
and an agricultural trend toward more profitable vegetable growing.

PENINSULA CITIES URGED TO COOPERATE ON HEAVY TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes City Manager Dennis McDuffie has called for a regional 
approach to controlling trucks on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in an effort to 
resolve a squabble that erupted when two cities there initiated ordinances 
banning heavy trucks on some major streets. 
</P>
<P>
In letters presented last week at a meeting of staff members from the four 
peninsula cities, McDuffie suggested that heavy trucks be confined to 
designated truck routes and that Hawthorne Boulevard be declared a truck route 
serving the peninsula. He also proposed that the minimum weight limit in truck 
ban ordinances passed by Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates be 
increased from 6,000 pounds to at least 10,000 pounds. That would ensure that 
the ordinances apply to large trucks, not "standard contractors' work 
vehicles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates City Manager Ray Taylor said traffic engineers from the 
four cities will analyze McDuffie's suggestions from "a traffic safety and 
engineering point of view" and identify routes that could handle heavy trucks. 
The engineers will report Sept. 12 to the city staff group, which has met twice 
since the truck fracas erupted. Besides Rancho Palos Verdes and the two cities 
that have initiated truck bans, Rolling Hills and Los Angeles County are 
participating in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rancho Palos Verdes protested Palos Verdes Estates' ban on 
trucks exceeding 6,000 pounds, contending that motorists could be cited for 
operating vehicles such as pickup trucks, motor homes and limousines that 
exceed that weight. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates officials responded that the ban, which is already in 
effect, was aimed at large dirt-hauling trucks, not private vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Critical 
</P>
<P>
A similar ban, applying to portions of Palos Verdes Drive North and three other 
streets, was enacted later by Rolling Hills Estates and takes effect Sept. 5. 
In imposing the bans, both cities contended that heavy trucks posed safety 
hazards and could damage fragile streets. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert has criticized both truck bans because they will 
route more traffic onto Torrance streets. 
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions by McDuffie include: 
</P>
<P>
* Joint maintenance of Hawthorne Boulevard by the peninsula cities and the 
county if it is designated a truck route. 
</P>
<P>
* Requiring all large construction projects to specify and maintain a 
transportation route to and from building sites. 
</P>
<P>
* Permitting trucks to use Palos Verdes Drive North in Rolling Hills Estates 
for trips to and from Chandler's Palos Verdes Sand &amp; Gravel, which operates 
a dump and a ready-mix concrete plant on the east side of Rolling Hills 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the truck ban on Palos Verdes Drive North, McDuffie said Rolling 
Hills Estates failed to consider the difficulty trucks have in turning right 
onto Pacific Coast Highway from Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance because of the 
acute angle of the intersection. "This will make a trip from Rancho Palos 
Verdes to Chandler's very difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
(The Rolling Hills Estates truck ban exempts heavy trucks using Palos Verdes 
Drive North within the city, but only until June 30. The exemption was granted 
to permit Chandler to complete work pouring concrete for the new Peninsula 
Center Post Office. The company and the post office site are within the city.) 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie also said that within Palos Verdes Estates, Palos Verdes Drive West 
and Palos Verdes Drive North "can easily handle" truck traffic without a safety 
problem. Reacting to contentions of Palos Verdes Estates officials that much of 
their truck traffic comes from Rancho Palos Verdes, McDuffie said traffic 
counts by his staff have shown that truckers use Rancho Palos Verdes streets to 
get to the southeastern portion of Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Malcolm, Palos Verdes Estates' interim city manager, said he is not 
contesting McDuffie's statement. "Our concern is about safety in our community 
and constant damage that major heavy trucks make on the roads, wherever they 
come from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palos Verdes Drive West and North through Palos Verdes Estates and 
Rolling Hills Estates are major peninsula roads, both cities say they are 
essentially residential streets that were not built to withstand heavy loads. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to McDuffie's proposals, the peninsula cities staff group is 
considering several other suggestions made by Rolling Hills Estates. They 
include a program to alert the trucking industry about restricted routes, 
cooperative truck enforcement on the peninsula that would include standardized 
signs, and construction of truck escape routes to improve safety on the 
Crenshaw Boulevard hill.

TORRANCE AND THE MOBIL OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud the action by the city of Torrance in denying Mobil Oil Corp. a 
permit to hold a fair within its refinery (Times, Aug. 20). In the 
corporation's twisted thinking, this is supposed to convince us the refinery is 
safe? Goodness! What do they think we imagine is going on in there? A chemical 
cornucopia a la Apex Chemicals in "Batman"? Valves rusted off the pipes? Hot 
molten oil running down the streets? Hydrofluoric acid belching out of 
uncontained vats? 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Mobil is not what you might or might not see in a daylong fair 
when you know very well the place will be spiffed up and on its best behavior. 
But like any complex system, it's the little things that go wrong that can ruin 
your whole day. A staff error. Someone not watching the valves. A leak in a 
storage tank. Storage tanks polluting the underground water supply. An aging 
pipe bursting just when it's carrying explosive chemicals to a dangerous spot. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mobil is under investigation for safety and pollution violations, I 
think it's incredibly callous on the part of its management to invite 12,000 
people inside its gates. What if something goes wrong that day that isn't 
attributable to staff error? What then? A catastrophe could happen. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being tops for showing real concern for public safety 
-- a 10 for Torrance, a 0 for Mobil. Back to Civic Responsibility 101, Mobil.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: SALTING AWAY TIPS ON SEAWATER AQUARIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Adrianne Goodman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost every kid has had a freshwater aquarium, stocked with the usual goldfish 
and guppies. 
</P>
<P>
But for adults who have maintained an interest in fish as pets, the 
expectations and rewards from their hobby -- along with their tastes -- may 
have grown a bit more elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the saltwater aquarium, a high-tech version of the ordinary fish tank 
whose upkeep requires more skill, more money, a basic knowledge of 
sophisticated aquarium-keeping techniques and a little more patience to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
But the rewards too can be greater: the psychic satisfaction of mastering the 
mechanics of seawater aquariums, as well as the visual beauty of the rainbow 
variety of marine life they offer, including brightly hued tropical fish, sea 
anemones, starfish, crabs, and other aquatic plants and animals that normally 
subsist only in the briny deep. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cabrillo Marine Museum on Saturday, 13 amateur aquarists with a passion 
for tropical marine life gathered for a class led by Lloyd Ellis, the museum's 
chief aquarist, on how to set up, stock and maintain seawater aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
The class included some basic tips on the technical aspects of seawater 
aquariums, such as the use of hydrometers to measure salinity and 
dechlorinators to transform ordinary tap water into aquarium-ready freshwater. 
After the water is dechlorinated, a synthetic sea salt is added to bring the 
water to proper salinity. 
</P>
<P>
The six-hour class also included such practical tips as how to tell a sick fish 
from a healthy one (avoid fish that are sluggish or appear battered, Ellis 
advises). 
</P>
<P>
Art Bernstein, an attorney from West Los Angeles who has maintained a saltwater 
aquarium for three years, said he set it up by trial and error after reading 
several books on the subject -- and "lost a lot of fish in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was at Saturday's class "to pick up some pointers," he said. "I used 
to have a freshwater tank but these are much more fun. The fish are brighter 
and much more colorful." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont teacher Elaine de Wet, attended the course with her daughter, Kathy, 
an underwater photographer. De Wet said that the course had given her ideas to 
take back to her sixth-grade classroom to incorporate into her science 
curriculum and that the museum will be a destination for a class field trip 
next school year. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Maier, a physician, said that he has had a fish tank sitting empty in 
his house for three years and that maybe the class would give him the 
inspiration to set it up "pretty soon.". 
</P>
<P>
As a medical student in the Philippines, Maier said, he kept a saltwater 
aquarium with moray eels and other marine life in it, but the creatures died 
when his girlfriend put in a decorative seashell that seeped a poisonous dye 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea to find out the right way to do it," Maier said. "When you 
walk into a pet store there's so much equipment to choose from. . . . I have a 
B.A. in biology, but I don't know if it prepared me for this." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing amateur aquarists to confront the often bewildering array of 
equipment needed to set up saltwater aquariums is one aim of the class, 
instructor Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis provided students with a list of the basic equipment needed, from the 
tank itself to a synthetic seawater kit, special sand or marine gravel for the 
tank bottom, carbon filters, air pumps, tubing and special thermometers. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis discussed the science of seawater aquariums -- including the advantages 
of natural material such as sand and ground oyster shells for filtering 
bacteria, compared to dyed or synthetic materials. But the class focused mostly 
on practical maintenance tips. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a subtle thing like putting your hand in the tank, if you have on hand 
lotion, over a long period of time can affect the quality of the water," Ellis 
said. "If you're going to spend $10, $15 or $20 on a fish, you don't want them 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
Museum aquarist Jeff Landesman, assisted Ellis in teaching the class, setting 
up a saltwater aquarium to show the students how it is done. 
</P>
<P>
Students also toured the museum's own seawater tanks, which are now dismantled 
while a water refrigeration system for storing the seawater is replaced. The 
rest of the museum, including scientific exhibits and slide shows, remains 
open, a museum spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Many students said they came away with a renewed appreciation for marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lai, a Torrance engineering manager, said his 10-gallon seawater tank is a 
constant source of wonderment to his two children -- even though his youngest 
daughter is only 4 months old. Lai, who said he keeps sand crabs, scorpions and 
starfish in the aquarium, said he too is constantly amazed by the unending 
variety of sea life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm inclined toward nature," Lai said, "and to be able to observe sea animals 
in your home where you can watch their behavior over time, that to me is very 
satisfying." Adrianne Goodman

A VOICE AGAINST SUNDAY MULHOLLAND CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the Mulholland Sunday closure from Kanan Road to Seminole Hot Springs 
(Aug. 5): Is this an efficient and economical use of sheriff's and CHP 
personnel? 
</P>
<P>
If the object of the exercise is to end street racing, then identify the dozen 
or so young men who insist on misusing the public road and impound their 
vehicles and restrict their licenses. As it is now, the cops are used as hired 
thugs to harass the business and patrons at the Rockstore, which is being 
scapegoated as the cause of street racing. 
</P>
<P>
Developers would love Ed &amp; Vern Savko, the owners, to be forced out, to 
obtain their property for continued exploitation of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
Where is the Planning Commission? Who is in bed with the local supervisor? 
Should sheriff's and CHP units be parked all day Sunday when there are real law 
enforcement and traffic duties elsewhere on the coast and access roads? 
</P>
<P>
The Mulholland Highway Scenic Corridor, conceived as a recreational route for 
citizens of Southern California, has become a fat prize for greedy developers 
intent on paving the entire mountains for profit. And the cops have become 
their gunsels. 
</P>
<P>
What will be next "For Our Own Good?" PCH closed except for those who can 
afford to live on the coast?

HUD SCANDAL AND AREA HOUSING STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent articles in the Times Orange County Edition about the way the Orange 
County Housing and Community Development Agency has administered federal 
Housing and Urban Development funds for housing rehabilitation are, from my 
experience, completely in error or vastly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
While I realize that you were only reporting the conclusions of other 
bureaucrats and possibly bringing to your readers a local example of a national 
scandal, I feel you have done a real disservice to Orange County HCD and its 
housing rehabilitation staff. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, our family qualified for a low-income loan for housing improvement 
under the then-applicable HUD guidelines. Before we even began planning our 
improvement, we were reminded several times that the completed structure would 
have to meet all current Orange County building codes, including the 
preexisting part that was not to be remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
A thorough inspection was made by a member of the HCD staff to determine if any 
changes were required to the existing structure. Only after those changes were 
made or included in the scheduled improvement were we allowed to proceed. 
Inspections were made by HCD staff at several stages of construction and on 
completion to make sure these changes were made. The financial side of the 
project was carefully monitored during all phases. 
</P>
<P>
I also know of several other projects that were completed in Midway City using 
funds from HUD. In each case, the project was required to meet the building 
code in its entirety at completion. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is unfortunate that this fine program and the Orange County HCD 
housing rehabilitation staff are being maligned as being part of a problem at 
the national level.

TRABUCO CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re your lengthy treatise on the fate of Trabuco Canyon (Aug. 6): It's tragic 
enough to contemplate the addition of 4,833 homes and a major thoroughfare in 
one of the last bastions of sanity in Orange Canyon. But the prospect of 
Saddleback Community Church wanting to erect something even more intrusive than 
the Crystal Cathedral boggles my mind. I can't believe God would prefer that 
man should build a massive edifice in His name, such as is proposed, to the 
pacific, natural beauty that He created.

FRONT NOT ONLY TALKED OF HARMONY, BUT LIVED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Henri E. Front, who died Wednesday, was much more than just the spiritual 
head of Temple Beth David in Westminster. He was a champion of the underdog, 
guardian of human rights and community leader. His loss will be felt throughout 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Front, a former Navy chaplain, was, at his death, a member of the Orange County 
Human Relations Commission, where he put his caring and commitment into action. 
He loved people and recognized early the county's growing ethnic diversity. 
With a deep respect for human rights, Front not only emphasized the 
similarities between various ethnic and religious groups, but showed a keen 
understanding of and respect for their differences. He was, noted Rusty 
Kennedy, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, a bridge for 
bringing people together. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, before Arab rights leader Alex Odeh was killed by a bomb planted in 
his Santa Ana office, Front had been working with him, planning a conference to 
help promote more Arab-Jewish dialogue. At the same time, he was seeking out 
other Arab leaders in the county. Front received death threats because of his 
attempts to bring the two groups closer together. He ignored them and continued 
his unifying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
He also helped bring together Korean and Anglo-Christian clergymen to work out 
the problems being faced by the small Korean congregations. And he recently was 
active in promoting closer contact between the black and Jewish communities. 
</P>
<P>
Front did not just preach harmony and peace, justice and equality. He lived it. 
He did not just exhort others to help those less fortunate. He went into the 
community and put his beliefs into everyday practice. His example of 
warmhearted activism leaves a void in Orange County that will be difficult to 
fill.

BENEFITS OF GOLF COURSES VS. PARKS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council had much to say last Monday night concerning the new proposed 
golf course for Huntington Beach. Listening to those opposed to the idea had 
you believing the next "Skins Game" was going to be played here. 
</P>
<P>
The word "passive" was kicked around quite a bit. There is quite a bit of 
passive park within the city limits of Huntington Beach. There are 
approximately 60 parks within the city limits, including Central Park, with a 
grand total of over 650 acres. Now that is what I call "enough passive" parks 
and acreage for one city of this size. 
</P>
<P>
What we need now is a way to continue to keep these parks flourishing for those 
who want a passive park. Who said "golf course" as a money-maker? Great idea! 
Lots of green grass, trees, water, sand and on top of all that, it helps to pay 
for all those "passive parks" that don't earn a dime for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in this city should be behind this new venture because it lightens the 
tax load on all of us!

On Aug. 15 in the Orange County section, you published an article that said a 
female police recruit at the Orange County Sheriff's Academy was the first 
female recruit to graduate at the top of the class. 
</P>
<P>
This was incorrect. Myrna Caballerd of the class No. 85 graduated No. 1 in the 
class, several classes before the recruit from Newport Beach. 
</P>

We were proud of her achievement and feel she should get the recognition.

PROPOSALS TO HIKE GASOLINE AND SALES TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is no surprise that California's transportation system is failing to meet 
our needs. Like our life's blood, state highways transport our food, fuel and 
wastes. If our blood system fails, the body dies. California's economic 
lifeline may also be fatally stricken unless our state's transit system is 
resuscitated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
A cure for this potentially deadly illness is at hand. An increase in the gas 
tax proposed by the governor, legislators, consumer groups and businesses will 
be on the ballot in the June, 1990, election. Revenues from a "user fee" of 
five cents the first year and one additional cent per year over the next four 
years will provide an $18.5-billion shot in the arm for transportation. The 
money will be solely devoted to transportation needs, including construction, 
maintenance and mass transit such as light rail, ride sharing and additional 
freeway carpool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most ambitious points of the plan is the requirement of local 
governments to develop growth plans to address specific transportation issues. 
Further, the legislation decreases bureaucratic red tape to reduce delays and 
cost hikes, keeping projects on time and within budget. 
</P>
<P>
If voters pass the measure next June, specific construction plans are scheduled 
to begin immediately. In Orange County, Interstate 5 will be modified in 
several areas to ease the commuter gridlock. Traffic lanes will be expanded on 
portions of the Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Garden Grove freeways. Reconstruction 
will begin for the interchange at the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways and 
also for an interchange on the proposed extension of the Corona del Mar freeway 
at the I-5. In addition, future plans include a commitment to widen and 
complete the right of way on the Santa Ana Freeway near Santa Ana and acquire 
right of way for the widening and creation of an interchange on the Santa Ana 
Freeway near the Orange and Garden Grove freeways. An area of Highway 74 
(Ortega) will be expanded. Lanes will also be added to portions of the Laguna 
and Riverside freeways . 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 20 years, the state's population will jump to 36.3 million. The 
number of vehicles will rise to 31.1 million. That's 7.5 million more people 
and nearly 9 million more automobiles. Without immediate adoption of this 
comprehensive plan, our urgent transit needs will remain unmet and our 
already-clogged arteries will come to an abrupt halt.

REV. LOU SHELDON AND RIGHTS OF HOMOSEXUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheldon's Commentary that homosexuality should not have a minority status is 
fatally flawed because if the average homosexual is a walking "tropical island 
of exotic diseases," doomed to "a life of self-destructive perversion," then 
why would anyone care to become homosexual? 
</P>
<P>
People do not necessarily choose to become homosexual and face the terrible 
discrimination, injury, disease and death. Rather, they are most often born 
that way, having little or no control over the constant uphill battle they must 
face against misguided religious fanatics. Hitler tried the same tactics in 
Germany with minorities, finally murdering thousands of homosexuals, but 
right-thinking men and women in the long run righted the injustice. The same 
will prevail in this case and every case where blind bigotry rears its ugly 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon may have homosexuality denied a minority status today; however, one 
shining day, society will grant all of its citizens equal rights and protect 
them to grow to their full potential.

<P>
The required immunizations are four diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis or 
whooping cough (DPT) shots, three doses of oral polio vaccine and one combined 
vaccine shot for measles, mumps and rubella. 
</P>
<P>
Children entering school for the first time are required to have a Mantoux skin 
test to determine exposure to tuberculosis. First graders must have a physical 
examination. Influenza vaccine is required for children entering child-care 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Immunizations and tuberculosis skin tests are given free at all county-operated 
health centers. 
</P>
<P>

VICTORY BRIGHTENS DAY, BUT PADRES PONDER 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Siegle, the Padre general manager, grimaced, put his hands over his eyes 
and slowly shook his head in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Siegle had just been informed Saturday afternoon that outfielder Chris James' 
right hand had been slammed in a car door by teammate Don Schulze. A team 
doctor immediately was summoned for an examination and fortunately for the 
Padres, the news was good. The injury was later diagnosed as only a deep 
bruise, with no bones broken. James will likely miss the next couple of games, 
but is expected to return to the lineup possibly as early as Monday for the 
three-game series against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it hardly was enough to soothe Siegle's sagging spirits: "You know 
you're going bad when that type of stuff is happening to you. Good God." 
</P>
<P>
Who then would ever have thought that it would turn out to be a break at least 
temporarily in the Padres' favor? 
</P>
<P>
Marvell Wynne, the man who just so happened to replace James in the lineup, hit 
a three-run homer in the fifth inning and drove in a career-high-tying four 
runs, helping provide the Padres with a 9-4 victory over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 28,469 watched the Padres win their fifth game in the past six and 
improve to 65-64. 
</P>
<P>
But considering that the Padres have just 33 games remaining this season, and 
are still nine games behind the San Francisco Giants, who can blame them for 
thinking about something more encouraging these days: the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre hierarchy is not scheduled to sit down and formulate their plans for 
1990 until after the final game, but rarely does a day go by when the Padres do 
not discuss their ideas among one another. Who will they keep? Who will they 
let go? What trades might they make? What must they do to become a contender 
once again? 
</P>
<P>
The front office has unanimously concluded that the primary needs are a 
starting center fielder, starting shortstop and pitching help. The fastest 
route, and perhaps the most logical, is the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitchers Mark Langston of Montreal and Mark Gubicza of Kansas City 
each are expected to file for free agency, and each say that the Padres are 
among their top choices for employment. Giant reliever Craig Lefferts is 
eligible to be a free agent. Robin Yount of Milwaukee and Mookie Wilson of 
Toronto are the top center field candidates. The best shortstop available is 
Spike Owen of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The question that suddenly has emerged, however, is will the Padres enter the 
free-agent market again? 
</P>
<P>
Although money seemingly would be no problem considering that the Padres will 
earn $15 million for their 1990 national TV contract and another estimated $6.5 
million in local revenue before they even sell a seat, the Padres appear 
reluctant to enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one," Siegle said, "am not big on the free-agent system. I've never 
been a big proponent of free agency. I'm just not convinced that's the way to 
go. I'd just as soon go the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"There are reasons to believe that there are players in Las Vegas who could 
help this club, but who knows the timetable?" 
</P>
<P>
The Padres revealed earlier in the day just who they believe is most capable of 
helping at the big-league level by announcing the four players who will be 
called up Sept. 2 from their triple-A team in Las Vegas: catcher Sandy Alomar 
Jr. (.310, 13 homers, 100 RBIs), outfielder Jerald Clark (.317, 20 homers, 80 
RBIs), second baseman Joey Cora (.314, 37 RBIs), and pitcher Eric Nolte (6-8, 
5.11 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is that Alomar is the only player among those four who 
has any trade value. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at our whole team," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said, "and we don't 
have a whole lot to trade. We really don't." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will experiment with Cora, 24, and try him at shortstop during 
September, but realistically, he's considered in their future plans only as a 
utility player. Clark, 26, has hit just .182 (six for 33) in his 14 big-league 
games. Nolte, 25, is 2-6 with a 3.33 ERA in 14 big-league games. And Alomar, 
23, still is unproven in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win this thing right now," McKeon said. "I don't want to keep 
rebuilding and rebuilding." 
</P>
<P>
The first step for the Padres, McKeon and Siegle said, is to determine just who 
they want back in 1990. They have five potential free agents: bullpen stopper 
Mark Davis, shortstop Garry Templeton, outfielders Marvell Wynne and Carmelo 
Martinez and infielders Luis Salazar and Tim Flannery. Davis is the only player 
among the group, Siegle said, that the Padres definitely want to retain. The 
future of the others will be decided after the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"Our needs are obvious," Siegle said, "but we really won't know what we need 
until the dust settles. I think basically, though, we need to get two or three 
players to fill holes." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' best bargaining chip, of course, is their catching surplus with 
Benito Santiago and Alomar. McKeon said that he hasn't had a legitimate trade 
offer since May before Seattle traded Langston. And with the shortage of 
top-quality catchers in the majors today, he refuses to panic and trade 
Santiago or Alomar away without obtaining top value in return. 
</P>
<P>
And even then, Siegle said, he's leery about trading away one of the catchers, 
particularly Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite what they say about Santiago," Siegle said, "you look at the 
exhibition he puts on night after night throwing people out (including Juan 
Samuel in the seventh inning Saturday). You just don't find catchers like that. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, we have a marvelous nucleus. I don't think we have to go into a mode 
where we totally revamp our club. We're not going to change faces just to 
change faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe Jack Clark will have a better year next season. Hopefully, 
Eric Show will be OK from his back surgery. (Bruce) Hurst will be settled in. 
We'll have James for a whole year. And I think Pags (Mike Pagliarulo) will be 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, you'd like to have a good everyday player in every position, but it 
just isn't possible. Maybe that's where the Las Vegas guys fit in. I mean, look 
at Bip Roberts. My God, where would we have been without him?" 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "We've been very patient with a lot of these guys who have been 
here three, four, five years. Our patience has run out. How long can we keep 
waiting? 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to find consistency, and until we do, we're going to have a 
tough time winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen (7-9) won his third decision in his past four starts, allowing 
six hits and four runs in five innings. Greg Harris earned his fourth save, 
pitching two hitless innings. . . . Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst, who left his 
last start Wednesday with a strained left groin muscle, did not suffer a tear 
as feared. Instead, team doctors are saying he aggravated the muscle. He'll 
miss his scheduled start today against the Mets, and then is expected to start 
Saturday against the Phillies. Don Schulze (2-1) will take Hurst's start today 
against Bob Ojeda, meaning that the Mets faced three former Yankee starters 
this series: Ed Whitson (1985-1986), Rasmussen (1984-1987) and Schulze (1989).

CASE FORCES SPORTS MEDIA TO EXAMINE NEWS ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY TRECKER, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That the Pete Rose story was a Page 1 item in morning newspapers and the 
subject of news cut-ins by the major television networks when official word of 
suspension was announced Thursday morning reminds us of the strange 
relationship sport has with hard news in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Although Americans are said to be more interested in sport than politics, the 
news of our games is usually confined to the sports pages or tightly managed 
spots on newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
When sports hits Page 1 and makes headlines on the evening news it's usually a 
sign that something has gone wrong in the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the Rose case has forced sportswriters and commentators to closely 
examine their arena over these past six months. While the story of Rose's 
alleged gambling has been told and retold since March, sports commentators have 
often asked whether Rose should be elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The question of "the player" vs. "the man" will continue to be discussed 
because Americans, quite simply, don't like to have their sports stories move 
dramatically outside the white lines. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the way ESPN has been following the saga reveals just how much it 
means to sports and fans. Thursday, ESPN devoted nearly two hours to live 
morning coverage of the news conferences surrounding the day's events and 
lengthened its evening SportsCenters to one hour from the usual 30-minute 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ley, who anchored live coverage of the July hearings when Rose gained a 
temporary reprieve, was back in the studio Thursday as ESPN completed its long 
pursuit of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Steiner, one of the ESPN SportsCenter regulars, had no doubts as long 
as six weeks ago that the Rose coverage was revolutionary for American sports 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years from now our Pete Rose coverage may be a watershed in this 
industry," Steiner said in July during the legal parrying involving Rose and 
Major League Baseball. "We are the only network that could devote all the time 
to it. This is our domain." 
</P>
<P>
The other broadcasters were very much present, however, when the news of Rose's 
suspension became fact. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't make sports their 24-hour-a-day business, they certainly were 
aware that this particular event transcended the ordinary limits. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had three live morning reports and spokesman Tom Goodman said, "This was a 
story of overwhelming importance. We had reports in "CBS Morning News" and "CBS 
This Morning" and also went live to Cincinnati for the Rose press conference." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman recalled that CBS News had included such stories as the Ben Johnson 
drug scandal, the death of Len Bias and the NFL strike on similar news reports. 
</P>
<P>
At ABC, "World News Tonight" spokesman Scott Richardson recalled that his 
network had included the Johnson Olympic drug story and Dave Dravecky's recent 
comeback from cancer as news stories, but said that the Rose affair was 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"When the story broke it was quickly a news story," he recalled, "and the fact 
that it has gone on over such a long period of time added to that. Part of the 
story was the delay." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly scandal is no longer unusual in American sports. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, however, always seemed to be in a different category, perhaps because his 
style of play had been so universally lauded by the same sports reporters who 
had to deal with the less savory side of their beats. 
</P>
<P>
Rose seemed a throwback to the days before the big money came into the game. 
Although a millionaire because of his playing skills, Rose always looked as 
though he belonged to the Gas House Gang of the 1930s rather than the 
businessman's elite of the modern player-agent age. He was a comfortable kind 
of hero. 
</P>
<P>
Having helped to perpetuate some of the Rose myth, it is not particularly easy 
now to separate that personna and the man on an August day in 1989. That's why 
sportswriters and commentators might feel more comfortable wondering what this 
does to Rose's Cooperstown credentials. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is a question that seems to fit within the neater, sports-first 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Rose story led the evening news on major American networks Thursday 
night, proof that its dimensions far transcend such neat categorization. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically the program delayed by ESPN's expanded early-evening SportsCenter, 
was a Little League baseball semifinal.

ALL OF JAPAN FOCUSES ON PREP TOURNAMENT

<P>
Ah, August in Japan. It's hot, humid, washed by typhoons, a time of nostalgic 
hometown visits and a marathon of high school baseball that holds the country 
in a sweaty, emotional embrace for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The schoolboys' baseball tournament ended Tuesday in a national finale with 
Teikyo High School of Tokyo winning a 10-inning thriller 2-0 over Ikuei High of 
Sendai, a large city in northern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams lined up at home plate, doffed their caps and bowed deeply to 
each other, tears streaming down the faces of both victors and losers. 
</P>
<P>
The Teikyo team tearfully sang its school song, and it seemed that summer, as 
usual in this country sometimes wrongly thought to be full of stoics, was 
ending in a bath of teen-age ballplayers' emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy I cried," Teikyo captain Koichi Gamo said. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of both teams cheered madly throughout the game, with continuous blasting 
by pep bands, rhythmic chants and clapping led by squads of cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
It has been like this every day since Aug. 9, when 49 schools started the 
elimination tournament at 58,000-seat Koshien Stadium in Osaka, the country's 
biggest baseball stadium. It's Japan's summer festival, a celebration in which 
every corner of the country sends a team up for a moment of glory or despair in 
the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament coincides with another hometown fete, the mid-August Obon 
season, when many city-dwellers go home for family reunions and to pay respects 
at ancestors' graves, and they have time to relax in front of the television to 
watch baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 49 teams that competed in this 71st summer tourney were the winners of 
local contests that started with a record 3,990 schools, from Okinawa in the 
south to Hokkaido in the north. Fresh-faced young athletes only 17 or 18 may 
leap to high-paying professional baseball with a great tournament, and they 
certainly can enjoy the swoons of teen-age girls who crush to the fences to 
photograph their idols. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only a time for teen-agers. Adults, too, pay close attention to the 
long tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to the close-knit family," said Corky Alexander, a longtime 
American resident of Japan who edits the weekly Tokyo Weekender. "People are so 
enamored of their kids here that they love to see these games." 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, professional baseball is overshadowed by the youngsters' games. 
Tuesday's edition of the daily Nikkan Sports devoted its first four pages to 
the semifinals, and pro baseball was relegated to page five -- even the news 
that American player Warren Cromartie, batting .402 for the Yomiuri Giants, has 
enough at-bats to become Japan's first .400 hitter if he sits out the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball fever can virtually empty a town like Naruto, a farming town east of 
Tokyo that sent 6,000 of its 20,000 people to Osaka on Aug. 10 to cheer the 
local team. Naruto won, and a week later Naruto was deserted again as 6,000 
people boarded 106 chartered buses and several special trains to travel 300 
miles to Osaka, only to join in the agony of defeat for their boys. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret of the tournament's popularity is that it is conducted nationwide, 
on a prefectural (state) basis, so everyone has a local team to root for," said 
Toru Aoyama, an editor with Number, a leading sports magazine. "Japan's pro 
teams are all too tied up with their corporate owners, not the areas where they 
are based."

'TALKING TONY' MUSER SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his playing career, they used to call him "Talking Tony" Muser. He was 
non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser recently took 
three hours away from a pennant race to do something that always came naturally 
-- make people smile. But this was different. It wasn't a laughing matter, and 
nobody understood that better than Muser. 
</P>
<P>
He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key 
Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows 
about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly 
endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been 
there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place 
in burn units every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the 
Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 55 percent of his body. He was delirious for more than 
a week, incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly 
inscribed in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That he is a major-league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the 
hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hang in there," Muser repeated over and over again. "It takes a 
lot of hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. "We haven't seen him smile like 
that since he's been here," said physical therapist Linda French as Muser spoke 
with Mike Lorenzo, who is recovering from burns over 80 percent of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he 
knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he 
said. But, when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Muser, yeah," said Lewis. "You used to play first base for the Orioles." 
It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in an Orioles 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and was 
anxious to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where 
skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a 
one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact. 
</P>
<P>
He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom 
Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related 
crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist 
Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along 
with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center 
Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand," said Muser, "is that we're dealing with people 
who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going 
to understand. People who have been burned are a special union." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, "was the turning point of 
my mental turnaround. When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement 
every day, where one day is better than the one before. I thought I was a tough 
guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can be until 
you go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Muser recalled his impatience in the first weeks of his recovery, when he 
actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for 
my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," said 
Muser. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the 
hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs, 
get on the bike and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't 
know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan, 
which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began dominating his mental 
approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that 
when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was 
in deep depression," Muser said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what 
I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Muser hit a chord when he left little doubt that he credits his recovery to the 
therapists who treated him, and the unique relationship he developed with other 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we had a nurse named Judy, we called her 'Iron Brush' and I don't 
even know her last name," said Muser. "I don't have to know her last name -- 
but she saved my life. When we left we got a piece of plywood and nailed an 
iron brush and a washcloth to it and gave it to her as a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
"We have one here, too," said Marshall. "Her name is Theresa, and she knows how 
much we appreciate her." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups," 
said Muser. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same 
time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing ... I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a 
macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you 
find out how many friends you have. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a 
lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a 
reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I 
don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is 
driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," said Muser. "The same 
thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane 
crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental 
scars are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He 
met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people 
did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day, 
time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted. 
Now, he knows better.

GIAMATTI HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO BAN PETE ROSE FROM BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a monumental sentence for a monumental ballplayer: Pete Rose banned for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Giamatti made the decision and stood up and made his thinking clear enough 
for anyone who cared to understand. He was what the commissioner of baseball 
ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming weight of testimony and evidence says Rose broke the rule that 
cannot be broken, no matter how many monumental records Rose owned: He bet on 
baseball and he bet on his own team. From his first day in baseball every 
player knows he must not bet on baseball; it's posted on the wall in every 
clubhouse like one of the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, if Giamatti were going to be a genuine commissioner, he had little 
choice in how he concluded the most agonizing moment of baseball since the 
Black Sox Scandal. "Baseball," he said, "almost died in 1921" in the wake of 
the 1919 World Series the Chicago White Sox conspired to fix for the gamblers. 
Judge Landis created the gambling rule that evolved in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Forever is a long time. The fact that Rose can appeal after one year is only a 
matter of form, according to the baseball rules. Giamatti could not have 
defined the suspension with a pound of his gavel as irrevocable. He likened it 
to a life sentence with the right to appeal after one year. There is nothing 
that says this commissioner or his successors are obligated to accept the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
It was a strong action that resulted from an investigation that began in 
February when Peter Ueberroth was the commissioner. It was a just decision. 
However baseball is woven into the fabric of life, it is entertainment and an 
optional pastime. It is not milk and bread on the table for the kiddies. Once 
there is a question of its honesty, baseball may as well be professional 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
There is no accusation that Rose deliberately caused the Reds to lose or that 
he bet against them, but there's little distinction in the rule. "The wisdom of 
Landis' rule is that it does not make any difference whether you bet for or 
against," Giamatti said. "The act of betting on a game you are involved in ... 
is to place your desire for monetary gain ahead of the team." 
</P>
<P>
And it was a bravura performance by Giamatti Thursday on the stage of the 
Sutton Parlor of the New York Hilton Hotel. Rose used a baseball bat; Giamatti 
uses the English language. He was witty and expressive, as always, and 
enlightening and expansive. He showed more of all of those qualities than any 
commissioner since Happy Chandler, who suspended Leo Durocher for the 1947 
season for associating with known gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
This is a time when public gambling abounds in state lotteries and in the 
threatening wave of legal football betting cards. Giamatti does not accept 
baseball betting on the grounds that everybody else does it. "I will be told I 
am an idealist," his prepared statement said. "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Both Giamatti and his office come out of this episode stronger because of it. 
Baseball had this "stain," he called it, and he did not make an exception for 
Rose's stature. To the contrary, it was more agonizing because Rose had his 
public image as the unyielding competitor baseball liked as its example. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody thinks I wanted to start my time as commissioner of baseball by 
going through this with regard to one of the greatest players the game has ever 
seen, they're wrong," Giamatti said. "I am sure there was great agony for Pete 
Rose and his family. Of course there was considerable personal agony for me and 
my family. There is no pleasure in any of this." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Giamatti would have preferred to find evidence that Rose was innocent 
of the charges. But when his predicament demanded that he make his defense 
before the commissioner, Rose could only seek to delay the process. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Rose and his lawyers chose to sign the Agreement and Resolution 
accepting Giamatti's judgment. They knew what they were signing and chose to 
resolve the matter that has been ticking since February. Rose still would not 
defend himself at hearings before the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
He chose a path of no contest. The Agreement and Resolution he signed specifies 
that Rose neither admitted nor denied the charges that he bet on baseball and 
on his team, but he knew the penalties were grave. He did not plead no contest 
to some misdemeanor. One does not lightly plead no contest to a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot manage or have any part in the operation of a baseball team. He 
cannot take a job broadcasting games so long as baseball teams have the right 
of approval, which means any big-league team. He cannot play in an oldtimers 
game in a big-league ballpark. His status for election to the Hall of Fame is a 
separate matter, subject to the voting of the Baseball Writers Association of 
America, but what once was automatic is now heavily clouded. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that Rose, in his statement in Cincinnati, said, "My life is 
baseball." He said he made some "mistakes" and was being punished for them. "My 
only regret up to this time," he said, "is I will not have the opportunity to 
tell my side of the story." Giamatti, to the contrary, said Rose repeatedly had 
declined invitations to hearings. Thursday, in fact, he said he was prepared to 
be in Dayton for a hearing with Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rose and his attorneys chose on Wednesday to end the matter by 
accepting the judgment of the commissioner. Apparently, Rose's counsel could 
see no gain in further delaying it. Perhaps the matter would have been 
concluded earlier if Giamatti had not been advised by his investigator, John 
Dowd, to sign a letter commending a witness who was a convicted felon for the 
"truthful" nature of his testimony. Giamatti got bad advice and took it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Rose would have been wiser to have admitted betting on baseball back in 
the spring, before the issue became whether he had bet on the Reds. Perhaps 
Giamatti -- or Ueberroth -- would have ruled a one-year suspension. Rose's 
lawyers did ask earlier if the commissioner would be satisfied by public 
service or charitable work or a fine. Giamatti would make no deal. 
</P>
<P>
This was a bigger issue. Even Thursday Rose was denying all. Perhaps that is 
evidence of sickness in Rose, an addiction to gambling. "I am not practicing 
clinical psychology or psychiatry," Giamatti said. This was a willful crime 
against baseball, and neither Rose nor his lawyers would claim Rose needed 
help. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a matter of hours after signing the papers, Rose was blithely selling 
his autograph on bats and balls and stuff on a cable shopping program. The 
baseballs were going for $39.94. 
</P>
<P>
That from the player who said he would be the first singles hitter to be paid a 
million. And was.

HE PUT MARYLAND RACING BACK ON TRACK AND TOOK IT TO THE WINNER'S CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death, which waits on no man, since not the time nor the hour is printed on a 
schedule, took Frank De Francis away before the letter ever arrived. The 
message was written last Wednesday, mailed the next morning and he died the 
following afternoon in the Miami Heart Institute. Considering the distance 
involved, it's presumed he didn't live long enough for it to be processed and 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
It was a personal note, as anyone might write to an ill friend, an attempt to 
provide a lift, a smile but, mostly, to give him a moment away from the 
monotony of a hospital routine when a few lines might brighten an otherwise 
taxing day of looking at the same walls and an unending procession of doctors 
and nurses monitoring pulse and heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
De Francis didn't need a letter from a sportswriter in Baltimore to underline 
what he was able to achieve in putting Maryland racing on his back and carrying 
it to the winner's circle. This was a man of extraordinary intelligence, 
inspiration and imagination. No individual came close to accomplishing what he 
was able to do for the health and welfare of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore and Maryland have never known a promoter like him. He spent millions 
to improve the Pimlico and Laurel race courses. The tracks were put in 
first-rate physical condition and the facilities around them, where the public 
was to be received, had a clean, impeccable, inviting appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The fans and the horsemen received a respect that had never been provided by 
managements in the past. This, more than anything else, separated De Francis 
from the rest of the parade. He believed the customer deserved the best that 
he, as a host, could provide. "That's the least we can do," he once remarked. 
Yet he did much more. 
</P>
<P>
All sports are in need of people with ideas and leadership. De Francis was a 
throwback to some of the outstanding promoters, such as George Preston Marshall 
in football and Bill Veeck and Larry MacPhail in baseball. He went all-out in 
aggressive pursuit for whatever it was he wanted to accomplish, but he went in 
totally prepared and immersed in the subject of his discussion. 
</P>
<P>
De Francis conveyed a quality of sincerity and, when he began to talk, either 
to the governor, the state legislature, a horse owner or a hot-walker, there 
was little doubt his persuasive ability was going to find him securing the 
result he sought. Members of the General Assembly, on guard, would see De 
Francis scheduled for another appearance before a committee. 
</P>
<P>
They knew he wanted something and would brace for his arrival, telling each 
other they were not going to give in to whatever it was he was intending to 
request. But, once he started working with the magic of his words, offering 
logical reasons for supporting the action he proposed and building to an 
eloquent, effective conclusion, the members would capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
De Francis articulated with an ability that is rare. He convinced the lawmakers 
racing needed tax relief. Others had voiced the same protestation in the past, 
ad infinitum, but their cries were never heard. Yet with De Francis, it was 
different. After his presentation, he went away with a cut from 6 percent to 3 
percent in the state's betting take and then, only a year later, 1984, got it 
reduced again to 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
He awarded worthwhile gifts to fans attending the races, which was a change 
because public perception was the tracks were only in a habit of taking -- and 
weren't interested in giving. De Francis' booming oratory won friends and 
influenced legislators. He had been an international lawyer but also a 
racetrack enthusiast, owning horses and enjoying the fire and the action so he 
knew his subject intimately. 
</P>
<P>
King Leatherbury, Laurel's leading trainer, realizes what De Francis meant to 
the business. "He did things that could have been done before, but nobody did 
them," said Leatherbury with a tone of thankful respect. The bottom line is the 
health and growth of Maryland racing, under De Francis' charge, caught the 
attention of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
De Francis reveled in the success of the Preakness and believed the 1989 event 
was perhaps the greatest in history from a competitive standpoint as Sunday 
Silence won by a nose over Easy Goer in an all-out battle through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
As with any man who is strong-willed and has the courage of his convictions, De 
Francis' intensity and his demands created a share of detractors. But he paid 
them no mind, even moving some of them, including those with ability, out of 
the way. It was a show he originated, orchestrated and directed. 
</P>
<P>
Now back, briefly, to the letter he never received. It was another lesson that 
again demonstrates the danger in putting off would-be good intentions until 
it's too late, or after-the-fact. De Francis died at age 62 of heart failure 
and Tuesday some of his friends attended a private, by-invitation-only, 
memorial service in the chapel at Loyola College in Baltimore conducted by his 
good friend, the Rev. Joseph Sellinger. 
</P>
<P>
The De Francis era was exciting and took Maryland racing to heights it had 
never known. He, indeed, was an individual of exceptional talent, a man able to 
conceive of new ideas and implement them, regardless of cost or inherent 
problems the procrastinators or opponents placed in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
The final letter, the one he didn't live to read, is expected back at any time. 
It'll be marked, regrettably, with the poignant notation: Return To Sender.

NORTHRIDGE SOCCER TEAM GAINS CREDIBILITY IN LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
MATADORS PLAY DIVISION I POWER UCLA ON EVEN TERMS BEFORE SUCCUMBING LATE IN 
MATCH, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA versus Cal State Northridge cannot be considered a rivalry yet, but the 
Matadors took a big step Saturday night toward making it one. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before 2,491 fans at North Campus Stadium in their annual 
season-opening soccer exhibition, the Bruins edged the Matadors, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The score was in stark contrast to last year's match when UCLA walloped 
Northridge, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We made them look human tonight," Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad said of UCLA. 
"In the past they toyed with us. They used us as playthings. But tonight we 
gave them a game." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, runner-up in the last two NCAA Division II championships, took a 
1-0 lead on Keith Martin's direct free kick at the 78:47 mark, but UCLA 
answered with two goals in the next 10 minutes for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Ferguson, a junior forward from Stockton, accounted for both UCLA goals. 
</P>
<P>
The winning goal came at the 88:32 mark when the Matador defense appeared to 
have a brief letdown after being whistled for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Gallegos sensed the drop in Northridge's intensity and fed Ferguson with a 
crossing pass in front of the Northridge net that goalkeeper Mike Littman had 
little chance of saving. 
</P>
<P>
"They caught us on our heels for a brief second," Ass'ad said. "We've got to 
learn that we can't do that. We have to constantly be on our toes." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which tied Dominguez Hills, 1-1, in a exhibition match on Tuesday, tied 
the match at 1-1 less than two minutes after Martin's score when Ferguson 
scored on a rebound of an Eric Page shot. 
</P>
<P>
Littman had deflected Page's attempt directly in front of the goal, but 
Ferguson was there to follow with a shot that Littman again deflected, but not 
hard enough to prevent it from rolling into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," said team co-captain Martin. "We just seemed to 
have a letdown after we scored. It seemed like our goal pumped them up. They 
seemed to get energy from it and we seemed to be a little slow after that." 
</P>
<P>
Martin caught UCLA goalkeeper Anton Nisti cheating to score Northridge's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Decoying a crossing pass to teammate Matt Ziegler, Martin decided at the last 
second to fire away instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I had no intention of taking the shot," Martin said. "But as I 
approached the ball, I saw him starting to go to his right side. When I saw 
that, I just let it fly and I lucked out. It skipped off the grass and 
underneath him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Ass'ad came away pleased with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we're way ahead of last year," he said. "We played much more 
aggressively against them tonight than we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
Although the first half ended in a scoreless tie, UCLA outshot Northridge, 8-2, 
and had four excellent chances at scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The best opportunity came when Gallegos got loose down the right sideline and 
fed Chris Roosen with a crossing pass that Littman dove to block at the 
10-minute mark.

DELAHOYA CURED OF HOMESICKNESS BY PRESCRIPTION OF GOOD PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Javier Delahoya of North Hollywood didn't have any trouble finding home when he 
began pitching in the minor leagues. It was pitching away from home that he 
first found difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya was selected by the Dodgers in the fourth round of the amateur draft 
in June, shortly before he graduated from Grant High. The 19-year-old 
right-hander was assigned to the Dodgers' rookie team in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I was lonely and homesick," Delahoya said from Florida. 
"I would call my parents three to four times a day. I couldn't talk to my 
teammates because I didn't know them." 
</P>
<P>
The phone stopped ringing at his parents' residence after Delahoya made his 
first appearance against the Baseball City Royals. He struck out five of six 
batters in two innings and quickly made some friends. 
</P>
<P>
It was his first and last relief appearance of the season. He earned a place in 
the starting rotation and the respect of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya said he rarely calls home any more and spends his free time going to 
the movies with teammates. He has also has developed a close friendship with 
pitching coach and former Dodger great Johnny Podres. 
</P>
<P>
"I can talk to him about anything," Delahoya said. "He has helped me with my 
change-up and taught me how to keep hitters off balance. I can hit the corners 
any time I want with either my fastball or change-up." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya ranks second in the Gulf Coast League with an earned-run average of 
1.46 and third in strikeouts with 70. He has compiled a 4-3 record after losing 
two one-run games because of errors. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers (30-29) beat the Red Sox on Thursday to clinch at least a tie with 
the Plant City Reds in the Northern Division. Playoffs begin Monday and 
Delahoya is expected to pitch the second game of the best-of-three series. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for a chance: The New York Mets eliminated three relievers from their 
roster with two trades in July, but they still haven't found a place for former 
Saugus High standout Shawn Barton. 
</P>
<P>
Though left-handed stoppers are rare commodities in the major leagues, the Mets 
already have one of the best in Randy Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Barton is having a mediocre year pitching for Tidewater (Fla.), the 
Mets' triple-A affiliate. In 38 appearances, he is 0-3 with five saves and a 
4.28 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets created openings in their bullpens when they dealt Rick Aguilera and 
David West to the Minnesota Twins, and reliever Roger McDowell to the 
Philadelphia Phillies in separate multi-player deals. 
</P>
<P>
New York, however, filled its opening for a left-handed long reliever by 
acquiring former Ventura Gull Jeff Musselman from the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Barton has a chance to be promoted when major league rosters expand to 
40 players, according to a Tidewater official. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a job: Former Olympic pitcher Sid Akins appears to have run out of 
places to make a comeback after being cut by the Atlanta Braves' double-A 
affiliate in Greenville, N. C. 
</P>
<P>
Akins, who has been plagued by control problems, pitched only seven innings 
before being released by Greenville in June. He had a 1-0 record and a 7.71 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Akins, a right-handed pitcher who played at Cleveland High and USC, was a 
member of the 1984 U. S. Olympic baseball team that won the silver medal as a 
demonstration sport in Los Angeles. That team also included Mark McGwire, Will 
Clark, Cory Snyder, Barry Larkin, B. J. Surhoff and Oddibe McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
While his teammates found immediate success in the majors, Akins floundered 
after being drafted in the third round by the Texas Rangers in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He spent two seasons each in the Rangers and Braves organizations before being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN alum on the rise: Former Cal State Northridge standout Robert Wheatcroft 
has found success despite pitching in hitters' parks and consistently giving up 
an average of four or more runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft earned a promotion in August after posting a 4-3 record and 5.29 ERA 
with the Baltimore Orioles' rookie team in Bluefield, W. Va. The right-hander 
currently has a 2-2 record and 4.18 ERA with the Orioles' Class-A affiliate in 
Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was drafted, Wheatcroft led the Matadors in wins (11) and was second 
in strikeouts (82) despite an ERA of 4.11. 
</P>
<P>
Struggling for hits: The Montreal Expos organization thought a change of 
scenery would help catcher Tim Laker. 
</P>
<P>
The former Simi Valley High standout was transferred from one Class-A team to 
another, going from Rockford, Ill., to Jamestown, W. Va., because he wasn't 
getting enough at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
In 58 games, he has a .222 batting average with two home runs and 24 RBIs for 
Jamestown. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive start: St. Louis Cardinals catcher Todd Zeile is batting .333 after 
being called up to the majors for the first time last week. The former Hart 
High and UCLA standout has one home run.

COMEBACK RANKS WITH SERIES BESTS

Woodland Hills West's dramatic, 8-7, win over Gonzales, La., in a third-round 
game of the American Legion World Series ranks among the biggest comebacks in 
recent series play. West trailed, 7-5, entering the bottom of the ninth but 
scored three runs to pull it out, capping a comeback from a four-run deficit in 
a game that ended Saturday at 1:15 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest come-from-behind rally since Edina, Minn., scored five runs 
in the eighth and ninth innings against defending champion Boyertown, Penn., in 
the 1983 championship game. Edina won, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, no team has reversed a decision in the final innings by scoring 
three or more runs. West, which trailed, 6-2, in the bottom of the seventh, 
scored three runs on Bobby Kim's three-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of its win against Gonzales, West was assured a berth in today's 
championship round. The game will be taped by ESPN and aired Tuesday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
West's appearance in the title game will mark the 21st time a California entry 
has advanced to the final. In 20 previous games, California teams have won 14 
times, the most recent victory by Santa Monica in 1976. Santa Monica defeated 
Plaines, Ill., 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
West players continue to rank among the front-runners for individual honors. 
After three games, infielder Del Marine was leading the race for the Louisville 
Slugger Batting Award, which goes to the player with the highest batting 
average in regional and series play. Marine is 16 for 31 (.516). 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Carl McFadden, who tied Friday night's game with a two-run double in 
the bottom of the ninth and scored the winning run, leads all players in runs 
batted in with 11 in regional and series play. The leader receives the Irvin L. 
(Click) Cowger Award. 
</P>
<P>
Marine leads in total bases with 23 in regional and series play. The leader in 
this category receives the Rawlings Big Stick Award. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Gibson, expected to play in today's final, is second in the running for 
the Bob Feller Award, which goes to the pitcher with the most strikeouts. 
Gibson, who has 29 strikeouts, trails Jeff Thelen of Janesville, Wis., who has 
31.

AZTECS SHOW PROGRESS IN SCRIMMAGE;

MCGWIRE, TRAKAS MOST IMPRESSIVE AGAINST 'AIR FORCE'

<P>
The little things that help college teams win football games are beginning to 
come together for San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of them evident Saturday as the Aztecs played a simulated 
game against a scout team impersonating Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was quarterback Dan McGwire opting to tuck the ball away and run 
to the sidelines to avoid a loss or a possible interception. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill said the play was McGwire's best -- not just Saturday but of 
his Aztec career. It wasn't that it produced yardage; it was that it was not a 
negative action. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't do something to kill your team. Keep it alive," Luginbill tells his 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Doing what he does do best -- throwing the football -- McGwire completed nine 
of 13 passes for 143 yards. "Everything was clicking today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was freshman kicker Andy Trakas, who was most impressive on either: 
a) an extra-point attempt that sailed 40 to 50 yards past the end zone, over a 
fence and onto Montezuma Road; b) a 35-yard field goal that flew over the 
45-foot high, supposed-protective screen behind the goal posts on the south 
side of the field, or c) a touchdown-saving tackle on which he caught speedy 
Robert Claiborne on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets the ball up in the atmosphere," Luginbill said. "(One of his kicks) 
just might the leave stadium." 
</P>
<P>
And throughout, there was Merten Harris directing the Air Force "look" team. 
Harris, playing the part of Falcon quarterback Dee Dowis, gained 70 yards on 
seven carries, including a nifty 21-yard touchdown run, and completed eight of 
18 passes for 120 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown to Toby Weymiller. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a receiver, did not care to know his statistics but was told anyway. 
With an ever-present smile on his face, Harris said, "Really? I was all right, 
huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
What Harris provides -- elusiveness, quickness, knowledge of the option and a 
pretty good arm -- gives the Aztec defense a chance to practice against Air 
Force's wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
Said Luginbill, "(Harris) has what I call unconscious ability." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said there were other things that pleased him. Penalties were 
minimal. The Aztec offense committed no turnovers and forced three by the scout 
team (a fumble recovered by John Wesselman and interceptions by Marlon Andrews 
and Robert Giffith). 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line, restructured about a week ago, played well, enabling Ron 
Slack (10 carries for 118 yards and four touchdowns), Curtis Butts (seven for 
80, two TDs) and Darrin Wagner (six for 36, one TD) to run. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some lapses and inconsistencies, the defense also played well, although 
it was purposely tested by being placed in difficult situations on almost every 
play. 
</P>
<P>
If the final score was kept, it would have been 56-20. Of course, this was just 
the scout team. The real Air Force is waiting next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Just a few plays after making an interception and returning it about 40 yards, 
second-team nickel back Robert Griffith broke his left arm during a kickoff. It 
was one of those gruesome injuries that required little inquiry or diagnosis. 
Griffith was to have been operated on Saturday night by Dr. Peter Wile at Mercy 
Hospital. He will be out indefinitely. Another safety, Chris Johnson sprained 
his left ankle. Griffith, from Mt. Miguel High, and Johnson, from Crawford, are 
both walk-on freshmen. Griffith was redshirted last season. Johnson will likely 
be redshirted this year.

THE FAMILY THAT SURFS TOGETHER . . . ; 
</P>
<P>
THE 11 MEMBERS OF THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH THEIR LIVES ON 
A WAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
A family's love for the ocean began in 1933 on a small island 10 miles off the 
coast of Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Young Dorian Paskowitz was sick with pneumonia. He also had asthma and was 
suffering from chills and a high fever. His mother, Rose, was ready to take him 
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Then something happened that Dorian Paskowitz, now 67, remembers as clearly as 
if it were yesterday. He was handed a newspaper picture of three surfers riding 
a California wave. Surfing was his biggest love. Somehow, the picture poured 
energy into him. He jumped up and said to his mother: "If you take me to 
California, I'll get well tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he got better. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Dorian, his brother, sister, uncle and mother moved to San Diego. 
His father, Louis, stayed behind for nearly a year, working to make enough 
money to recover from the Depression, which had caused him to lose his "Ready 
to Wear" store and consequently stripped him of financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
The family was poor. But Dorian was never sick again. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is what prompts a man to devote his life to surfing, and to raise 
a family of nine surfers, educating them himself, teaching the powers, wonders, 
dangers and therapeutic qualities of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member Paskowitz family, most of whom reside in San Clemente, had a 
reunion this weekend at the Oceanside Longboard Surfing club contest at the 
Oceanside Pier. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't hard to spot, with their colorful surfboards scattered all around 
and their warm, supportive cheers for each other as they took to the surf. 
</P>
<P>
There was Dorian, wearing a hat to protect his sunburned lips, his wife, 
Juliette, proud mother of nine, and the kids, who aren't really kids at all 
anymore. Starting from the top there's David (30), Jonathan (28), Abraham (27), 
Israel (26), Moses (24), Adam (23), Salvador (22), Navah (20) and Joshua (14). 
</P>
<P>
Juliette was the only one not entered in this weekend's tournament; Adam had to 
leave early because of a business emergency. 
</P>
<P>
They hadn't been together at the same time in two years, but the beach is such 
an appropriate place for the Paskowitzes to reunite. Surfing has truly been a 
guiding light for this family. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Moses sums up the outlook best. "I call (surfing) a soul cleanser. It 
makes you forget all your worries." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Paskowitz never surfed and only saw Dorian surf once, but somehow he was 
aware of how important it was to his son. Sometimes on school days, Louis would 
give Dorian a quarter and say: "Go buy yourself a hamburger and go surfing." 
</P>
<P>
Dorian surfed through his days at Point Loma High School, his two years at San 
Diego State and then for a year at University of Hawaii, where he further 
developed his skills and grew to appreciate the Hawaiian life style. Never 
before had he seen such hospitality and friendliness. And never had he seen 
such skillful surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like you'd been singing in grammar school," Dorian says, "and 
suddenly someone took you to the Metropolitan Opera House." 
</P>
<P>
After a year in Hawaii, Paskowitz moved back to California and attended medical 
school for five years at Stanford. Years later, while examining war veterans, 
Paskowitz was able to tell if they were former surfers by the nobs on their 
knees and the sand in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
Paskowitz would say to a veteran: "You just been to Hawaii?" 
</P>
<P>
He would say: "Yeah, how did you know?" 
</P>
<P>
One time, though, he asked somebody if he had just been to California and was 
told, "No, I'm from Hawaii, never been to California." 
</P>
<P>
But the sand in his ear was unmistakably from California. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently," Paskowitz says, "he'd been to a beach where they import some 
California sand." 
</P>
<P>
Paskowitz lived for a year and a half in Israel, beginning in 1956. He says he 
was the first person to bring a surfboard into the country and brought with him 
the idealistic hope that if he introduced surfing to the Middle East, it might 
help bring peace. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I was very naive," he said. "I thought if the Arabs surfed 
together, they could live together." 
</P>
<P>
It was in Catalina, about a year later, that Dorian met Juliette, an opera 
singer of Mexican descent who grew up in Long Beach. When he asked her to marry 
him, he told her his plans didn't exactly conform with a typical American life 
style. Dorian wanted to travel and raise a family of children who experienced 
the world first hand, not from reading notes off a chalkboard. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted them to do was surf," he said. "I knew if they were good surfers, 
they'd be good human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Juliette's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"All I could see," she says, "were those blue eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Just once, Abraham Paskowitz would have liked a pair of clean socks or his own 
tennis shoes. Just once, he would have liked his own bed. 
</P>
<P>
The Paskowitzes learned to adapt to all kinds of living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing you could say about a Paskowitz is they could sleep anywhere," 
Moses says. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham, whose wife Ladeshia is expecting a baby in October, will offer his 
children a more permanent place to sleep. There will always be a home for his 
family to return to, though he plans to mix in some Paskowitz tradition. 
Surfing will be taught, and curiosity will be encouraged. Someday he plans to 
tell his kids: "The world is your playground, but this is your home." 
</P>
<P>
The Paskowitzes' home was usually a camper, and each morning the children would 
wake up not knowing where they were. They learned to make do, Dorian often 
seeking out spots where doctors were needed. Living quarters were sometimes 
cramped, but as Moses puts it, you always had a best friend. 
</P>
<P>
Because the children were so close, they were used to being around each other. 
Dorian once rented a 16-bedroom mansion in Rhode Island, and after each kid had 
run around and played in every inch of the house, they all returned to one room 
to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so used to sleeping together, we didn't want to be apart," Abraham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And so they traveled and learned. Dorian and Juliette were the teachers; the 
children went to regular schools on and off, but only David has a high school 
diploma (although others have earned its equivalent). Creativity was 
emphasized, and to this day it spills over into each of the Paskowitz's lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Artists 
</P>
<P>
Salvador and Joshua would wile away hours and hours drawing. Joshua, Salvador 
admits, has a good deal more raw talent. Joshua already has done logos and 
designs for surfboards and plans to start doing more pencil art, with an 
emphasis on surrealistic sketches. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador recently published 25,000 copies of his own comic book, called "Wave 
Warriors," and is flying to New Jersey next week to meet with publishers 
interested in a second issue. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador says he knows six computer languages to boot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Musicians 
</P>
<P>
Surfer by day, David becomes Johnny Monster at night. He's the lead singer of a 
rock band called Johnny Monster and the Nightmares, which has an "aggressive, 
powerful guitar-oriented sound." 
</P>
<P>
David's music career got its start seven years ago when he jumped the family 
ship -- actually, the Paskowitzes' 1972 brown two-door Chevy Impala -- and 
began singing with night club bands in New York City. Two years ago, he decided 
the New York life style was too fast for him and returned to San Clemente and 
his surfing roots. Now he can do both in an environment in which he is 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Adam is about to sign a record contract with his band, Mozart. According to 
David, he writes music for the intelligent man. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam is a real genius," David says. "He's a nice guy trapped in a smart Jewish 
man's body." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Girl 
</P>
<P>
You can guess that this hasn't been the easiest gig for Navah, who has no 
sisters and eight brothers. For the longest time, it seemed to her as if she 
wasn't much more than her mom's kitchen helper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just the most protected person there could be," she said. "It's harder 
for me to find boyfriends because my brothers are really critical." 
</P>
<P>
Navah said she didn't really have her own identity until she was 15, when she 
moved to New York to live with David. She tried to get into design school but 
was told she needed some formal education. She came back after three years with 
fluorescent red hair and a leather jacket. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, she plans to do some modeling in Australia. She is currently singing 
backup in Adam's band and still hopes to pursue a career in fashion design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Black Sheep 
</P>
<P>
If there is a rebel in the family, it is Jonathan. He spent eight years in 
Israel, which can change a person's outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the gunfire every night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned, he tested the night life. As owner of a night club in Los 
Gatos, he said he stayed up too late, drank too much and smoked too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a bad egg," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing turned his life around again. He entered a longboarding contest five 
years ago in Malibu and finished fourth. The feeling he got from being back on 
the ocean made him feel as if he would never want to return to his former life 
style. He now works as a public relations agent for a company that manufactures 
surf products, and he sometimes gets autograph requests from little kids at 
surf contests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Football Player 
</P>
<P>
Moses weighs 295 pounds and said he weighed more than 300 when he played 
football for University Nevada-Las Vegas and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a little bigger wave," he says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
He played two years at each school, starting all four. His inspiration in 
football came from his Pop Warner days, when his mom told him she'd buy him a 
chuck steak for every quarterback sack. 
</P>
<P>
Moses would eventually like to oversee the production of a Paskowitz surfing 
product. He's teaching surfing in the meantime, telling his students: "If Elvis 
surfed, I really feel he'd be alive today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Manager 
</P>
<P>
Abraham is the director of the Paskowitz Surfing Summer Camp, which has gained 
a world-wide reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few days ago, they wrapped up another successful 10-week session in San 
Clemente, where it has been based for 15 years. It attracted 135 surfers from 
places such as France, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham is a blend of creativity and business. "I create," he says, "for 
monetary value." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Surfer 
</P>
<P>
After Israel won the longboard world championships in Australia two years ago, 
he found it easier to cash checks. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't need an ID," he says. "Everybody knew me. I must have signed 
thousands of autographs." 
</P>
<P>
It was about then that the prize money and sponsorships started flooding in. 
Israel isn't sure he has always spent his money wisely. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot of money but you have to budget it," he said. "I have not 
inherited that wonderful Jewishness of saving money."

AT HOME: CHARACTER ON A BUDGET IN ATWATER VILLAGE;

NEAR DOWNTOWN L.A., HOMEOWNERS FEEL SAFE STROLLING TO SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Phil and Marie Meltzer began house hunting in 1987, they wanted an 
affordable neighborhood close to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Phil, a self-employed recruiter for data processing and software companies, and 
Marie, a fine arts saleswoman, missed the urban ambiance of Chicago, their 
former home. They wanted a house that was close-in and near freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, they wanted a house with character that would fit their modest 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Their search led them to Atwater Village, an older, blue-collar community that 
some realtors call "the poor man's Los Feliz," where for $120,000 they bought a 
two-bedroom 1920s Spanish-style house with cathedral ceilings, hardwood floors, 
red tile roof and large garden. 
</P>
<P>
They like the ethnic diversity of the area, and that they can walk to nearby 
stores and restaurants. "I try to recruit everyone I meet to the neighborhood," 
Marie Meltzer said. "Three of our friends have bought houses here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's a Sleeper 
</P>
<P>
"Atwater Village is a sleeper," said Joe Wilson, an associate broker at Fred 
Sands Los Feliz. "It's (one of) the last affordable districts that is close in. 
Because it's surrounded by Los Feliz, Silver Lake and Glendale, Atwater is an 
area that should continue to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Tree-lined streets, steepled churches and specialty businesses along Glendale 
and Los Feliz boulevards, the area's major arteries, give a first impression of 
small-town ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
But as you explore more deeply, you may also see mom-and-pop ethnic markets, 
pushcart vendors selling fresh-fruit Popsicles and an occasional 
graffiti-spattered wall. A carefully painted home with manicured garden may 
face an unkempt house or small apartment with cars parked on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Atwater Village is a neighborhood in flux. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like pioneers when we moved here," Jenny Smith-Moore, a children's 
book illustrator and artist, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House Was a Mess 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, when we bought the house, it was a total mess," said her 
husband, David, a fine-art photographer and instructor at The Otis Art 
Institute of Parsons School of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was dirty inside, and the yard needed to be cleaned up. There were 
chicken coops and weeds everywhere. The neighborhood didn't bother me too much 
because I had lived downtown in a loft before we were married. I like the 
ethnic diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The Moores bought their two-bedroom English cottage for $119,000 in a probate 
sale. They stripped wallpaper from the walls and varnish from the moldings, had 
the oak floors pickled, and tore out linoleum from the bathroom to reveal the 
original mosaic tile in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen they removed several layers of linoleum and painted the pine 
sub-flooring white to remind them of flooring in the loft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scrimping and Saving 
</P>
<P>
"When we bought our house in 1986, we felt a little at risk," said Steven 
Peterman, a writer-producer for television's "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
"We had been scrimping and saving for a house. We didn't have family who could 
give us a down payment, so we had to look for a place we could buy by 
ourselves. Atwater was one of a limited group of choices. It's gotten to be 
more chic, with young couples moving in and nice shops and restaurants opening. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the diversity of the neighborhood," said Siri Ludwig, a 
physician and associate professor at USC Medical School. Ludwig and her 
husband, Eric, a graduate student, allow their three children to play out 
front. They feel safe walking to shops and the library on Glendale Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast Division said 
Atwater has a relatively low crime rate. Residents do worry about several local 
gangs, and many band together to paint out graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry About Crime 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Scott, whose family moved to Atwater in 1922 when she was a baby, 
remembers a time when children could safely play outdoors at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about graffiti, crime, bars on the window and vandalism, but the 
neighborhood hasn't changed to a point where I'd want to move," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many Los Angeles neighborhoods, Atwater Village has clear boundaries -- 
Fletcher Drive on the south, the Los Angeles city line on the north, the Los 
Angeles River on the west and Glendale to the east. 
</P>
<P>
According to brokers, the area between Los Feliz and Glendale boulevards is 
considered the most desirable because there are fewer apartments. Houses -- 
English cottages, Spanish-style residences with tile roofs and craftsman 
bungalows -- are listed from $199,000 to over $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Vary Widely 
</P>
<P>
Between Fletcher Drive and Glendale Boulevard, small apartment buildings with 
two to eight units are found next to single-family houses or lots with two 
houses. House prices here range from $185,000 to $195,000. 
</P>
<P>
The area north of Los Feliz is the most diverse. Homes near the river that 
permit horses can run as high as $450,000. Closer to Chevy Chase, houses can be 
purchased for under $200,000. Properties near the industrial section of North 
Atwater are considered less desirable, as are those close to Fletcher Drive and 
the train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the district was part of Rancho Santa Eulalia, which extended from 
the Los Angeles River to south Glendale. The ranch was divided by the 
construction of the Southern Pacific railroad in the late 1800s. The area north 
of the tracks became known as Tropico, a community annexed to the city of 
Glendale in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
In 1912, developers began subdividing the area west of the tracks. The district 
was named Atwater to honor Harriet Atwater Paramore, a pioneer resident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Neighborhood Watchdog 
</P>
<P>
Ed Waite, president of the Atwater Village Homeowners' Assn., moved to the area 
in 1955 because he liked the central location and village atmosphere. 
Considered by many as the neighborhood watchdog, he has fought to keep 
undesirable businesses such as wrecking yards off Glendale Boulevard and he has 
been instrumental in down-zoning most of the area to R-1 (single-family 
residential). 
</P>
<P>
Waite, who lives in a miniature castle he describes as Aztec in design, heads 
an association of close to 400 residents that meets several times a year at 
Glenfeliz Elementary School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to keep the area a pleasant place to live so it will attract new 
residents with pride in their neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waite is concerned about the fate of the Franciscan Pottery plant on Los Feliz. 
The site has been purchased for a shopping center, and the owner is proceeding 
with a costly cleanup of industrial waste. The Los Angeles Unified School 
District is also looking at the site for possible construction of a new high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future of the Boulevard 
</P>
<P>
Residents and business owners also worry about the future of Glendale 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"What goes in at the site of Beach's Market will determine the destiny of 
Glendale Boulevard," Waite said. An Atwater landmark, Beach's, was razed 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a concern that the business area develop the village ambiance," said 
Chris Hershey, owner of a design studio and president of the Boulevard Business 
Assn. Several years ago the association, along with the homeowners' group, 
lobbied to change the district's name to Atwater Village. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale Boulevard is attracting design people and fine artists. There are two 
photographers and three design businesses here. We would like to see the 
neighborhood develop in that direction," Hershey said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were ecstatic when an upscale eatery, Osteria Nonni, opened earlier 
this year on Glendale Boulevard. Designed by the architect Angeli on Melrose 
Avenue, the restaurant, which features pigtailed waiters, high-tech decor and 
designer pizzas, has drawn capacity crowds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Library 
</P>
<P>
A new library and several antique shops have joined older boulevard businesses 
such as the Rolling Pin Bakery where locals gather to munch strudel and sip 
coffee, the Pueblo Gift Shoppe and Glenhurst Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
New residents are hopeful that the neighborhood will continue to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Meetings of the homeowners association are really uplifting," Smith-Moore 
said. "When I see an overflow crowd, I know there is concern for the 
community."

'FAD' ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for a provoking article ("Is Architecture Becoming the Latest 
Merchandising Fad?" by Sam Hall Kaplan, Aug. 6). As a graduate of SCI-ARC, I 
know well the elitist view noted by Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
It is refreshing and encouraging to see an alternative view of the "funky, 
punky structures" in such a widely read publication as The Times. Please know 
that there are many in the profession who agree with (architect John) Lautner. 
</P>
<P>
To question the validity of the trendy work so prevalent in the media these 
days is somewhat akin to the emperor himself pointing out that he has no 
clothes.

ASSESSMENT OF LYNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to comment on some of the claims made by Assessor 
John J. Lynch with respect to his explanation of the failure of his office to 
process Proposition 60 applications (Speaking Out, Aug. 6). 
</P>
<P>
In his carefully worded response to Jenny Erickson's complaint about the 
processing of Proposition 60 claims, Lynch attempts to portray himself as a 
champion of responsive taxpayer assistance. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of Lynch's response to Erickson is a good example of his real 
commitment to "quick action." Although she initiated the sequence of events in 
December, 1986, Lynch refuses to admit that his office failed to timely process 
the claim, lamely blaming Erickson and her adviser. As if this isn't 
objectionable enough, Lynch tells her to wait until December, 1989 for her 
refund, years after his department could have processed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
It is a shame that Lynch's best response to a senior citizen is to only promise 
that to resolve her problem will still require another six months.

SMALL INVESTORS: SHOULD FIVE OFFICE WORKERS POOL RESOURCES AND FORM 
CORPORATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I plan to invest with four other people from my office in a real 
estate investment group. We will buy two rental townhouses. Do you think we 
should form a corporation? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No. Corporate ownership of small real estate investments offers 
virtually no advantages but many disadvantages. Limited liability is the major 
advantage. However, you can limit your liability by carrying adequate liability 
insurance. But corporate disadvantages of real estate investments include 
possible double taxation of profits and limitations on pass-through of losses. 
</P>
<P>
A far better alternative is a limited partnership, which limits your liability 
but allows pass-through of tax benefits to the limited partner investors. A 
real estate attorney can prepare your limited partnership agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Types of Investments Beginners Should Seek 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you recommend as the best type of realty investment for a small 
investor just getting started? A business associate owns small apartment 
buildings but he is always complaining about his troublesome tenants. Are 
apartments good investments? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, apartments can be excellent investments. However, as a former apartment 
investor, I am prejudiced toward single-family rental houses. I find them much 
easier to manage. Also, houses rise in market value as neighborhood values 
appreciate. But the value of apartments depends on their net income. 
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, I recommend buying run-down "fixer houses" which you can 
upgrade to increase their market value. After you renovate, then you can either 
sell for an immediate profit or hold for long-term investment. Further details 
are in my special report "How to Earn Big Profits Fixing Up Houses" available 
for $3.50 from Newspaperbooks, 64 E. Concord St., Orlando, FL 32801. 
</P>
<P>
Making Tax-Deferred Trade for Apartments 
</P>
<P>
Q: If we sell our large old home our profit will be about $150,000. We would 
like to use our profit to buy an apartment building where we could live in the 
manager's apartment and run the building. Is there any way we can avoid paying 
tax on our home sale profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Move out of your home and rent it to tenants, thereby converting it to 
investment or business property. Then it is eligible for an Internal Revenue 
Code 1031 tax-deferred exchange of business or investment property such as 
apartments. Personal residences do not qualify for this preferred tax 
treatment. Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
How to Decide Whether to Rent Out or to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Q: About six months ago I bought a run-down house, which I have now fixed up 
into first-class condition. I paid $119,000, which was a bargain. After 
spending about $25,000 on fix-up, the house is now worth close to $200,000. 
However, the problem is it will only rent for about $1,100 per month. Do you 
think I should sell or keep this house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Congratulations on your successful and potentially very profitable purchase 
and fix-up of that house. You have a very pleasant dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Although you didn't give details of the financing, I presume you have 
substantial mortgage payments to consider. If the rent will not pay your 
monthly expenses, I strongly suggest you sell the house to avoid the negative 
cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
I often encounter the same situation you describe. I hate to sell property 
because it usually skyrockets in market value just after I sell, but I also 
dislike negative cash flow. Since you have a handsome profit and the low rent 
attainable does not justify keeping the house (unless it is appreciating nicely 
in market value), I vote for selling. 
</P>
<P>
Be Wary; Out-of-Area Investing May Be Risky 
</P>
<P>
Q: I hear from a very reliable source that the real estate market in Houston 
has bottomed and is starting to rise slowly. A real estate company there will 
buy and manage rental homes for me. They already have tenants for these houses. 
Do you think this is a good deal? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Please don't invest money you can't afford to lose. I do not advocate 
investing far from home because too many long-distance investors lose money 
since they cannot manage their out-of-town properties. 
</P>
<P>
For example, just a few days ago I heard from a reader who owns an Idaho rental 
house that has declined in value the last few years and is now worth $20,000 
less than the mortgage balance. If this lady lived in the community she could 
have observed local economic conditions and sold the house while she had a 
profit or her loss was small. Now she has a very costly problem. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I have heard the Houston real estate market is recovering. However, watch 
out because mortgage lenders are holding thousands of foreclosed properties off 
the market there in hopes of rising prices. If prices rise, don't be surprised 
when the lenders try to unload their foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
The grass is usually greener close to home within a half-hour to one hour 
maximum drive. As I've often said, you can see, feel and smell your investment 
property when it is nearby. That means you can easily manage nearby investment 
property to maximize its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Deducting a Loss on Home Brother Rented 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago we moved out of our home in Louisiana. We rented it to 
my brother and his family. However, he just lost his job and has decided to 
move away from Louisiana. Our problem is the house has declined in value about 
$25,000 from what we paid for it. Stupidly, we paid all cash when we bought the 
house, so the loss will come out of our pocket. My attorney told me a loss on 
the sale of a personal residence is not tax deductible. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Losses on the sale of your personal residence are not tax deductible. 
However, when your brother and his family moved into your former principal 
residence that converted it into business or investment property. Losses on the 
sale of business and investment property are tax deductible. Please consult 
your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>
<P>
Be Prepared for IRS Tax-Deferral Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Q: About a year ago we tried to sell our home but were unable to do so because 
of local economic conditions. So we rented the house. Now we want to sell as 
the market has improved considerably. Will we be able to defer the tax on our 
sale profit which we expect will be about $30,000? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably. As you surely know, Internal Revenue Code 1034 allows you to defer 
your home sale tax when selling your principal residence if you buy a 
replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 months 
before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
However, this law does not say if a temporary rental due to local economic 
conditions will disqualify the tax deferral. But a Tax Court decision (Clapham 
63 T.C. 505, 1975) allowed tax deferral in similar circumstances where the 
seller took three years to sell his former residence which he rented in the 
interim. If you claim tax deferral be prepared for an IRS challenge which you 
may successfully meet. Please consult your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>
<P>
He's Cash Poor, but Income Property Rich 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have never seen my problem discussed in your excellent column before and 
hope you can help. My wife and I own a small apartment building free and clear. 
But if we sell we will owe a huge tax. However, if we don't sell we will be 
facing repairs that we can't afford. What do you recommend? Should we sell? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are property rich and cash poor. This is a common situation among real 
estate tycoons, so don't feel bad. 
</P>
<P>
I never recommend selling sound, well-located real estate without a very good 
reason. Unless Congress reduces the capital gains tax rate to make selling your 
investment property a viable alternative, you might want to obtain a new 
mortgage to solve your cash crunch problem. Since you can surely afford the 
payments from the rental income, this is probably your best alternative.

STUDY SAYS PLASTIC PIPE SAFE TO USE FOR TRANSPORTING DRINKING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plastic pipe can be used to carry drinking water into new homes and apartments 
without threat to health or fire safety, a state report has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary environmental impact report (EIR) found "no unavoidable 
significant adverse effects" from substituting plastic for copper, cast iron or 
galvanized steel in hot and cold water lines in residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the use of plastic piping centers on possible threats to public 
health from chemicals used in the plastic, pipe-joining material, or in the 
surrounding soil, which may be contaminated, and on how it may affect plumbers 
using the material who are exposed to fire or smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The studies found that a few chemicals from plastic pipe and solvent cements 
leach into the drinking water, but to negligible degrees which are thought to 
pose no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, plastic pipe is not allowed to carry water inside dwellings, and 
only two types -- polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene -- are allowed for cold 
water outside a dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
Three other types are permitted for use as drain, waste and vent pipes in 
structures of two stories or less: polyvinyl chloride, 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plumbing Code Changes 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Housing and Community Development is considering 
allowing plastic pipe to conform with changes in the Uniform Plumbing Code, 
which permits plastic pipe substitution for copper or galvanized iron pipe used 
to carry hot and cold water in residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The EIR also found no significant adverse effects of plastic piping on housing 
prices, pipe manufacturing and plumbing employment, or on energy consumed in 
pipe manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is seeking public comment on the EIR for the next two months, at 
hearings in Los Angeles Sept. 26 and in Oakland on Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearings, a final EIR will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
In two studies commissioned by the housing department, UC Berkeley analyzed 
chemicals that might be released by plastic pipe into drinking water, and the 
California Department of Health Services studied plumbers' exposure to 
chemicals used to assemble plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plumbers Safe 
</P>
<P>
Plumbers installing the pipe would be safe unless they drank large quantities 
from an unwashed pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Safety aspects of using plastic pipe were unclear, since plastic pipe was 
thought to decrease injuries from lifting and burns, but cause more hurried 
work by less trained individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the effects of exposure to solvents and susceptibility to fire 
produced no conclusions indicating significant risk or danger. 
</P>
<P>
If the changes are adopted at the state level, local jurisdictions also likely 
would seek similar changes in their codes.

<P>
Corian is a solid, non-porous surfacing material often used for countertops, 
sinks, shower walls and wainscoting. Jost's design for a coffee table sculpted 
form Corian and accented with metal and glass was hailed as "exceptionally 
imaginative" by the judging committee. 
</P>

If you've ever eaten wild strawberries fresh from a mountain meadow, dripping 
with juice and sun-ripened, you'll never forget the exhilarating flavor. If you 
haven't, you can grow your own Alpine strawberries in garden or container and 
savor their unique taste. 
</P>
<P>
Alpine strawberries are quite different from standard strawberries in flavor, 
size and in growing requirements. Known in Europe as wild strawberries, they 
are a very expensive gourmet treat and are served in Europe's finest 
restaurants. They are much smaller than regular strawberries, and their flavor 
is closer to that of a raspberry than that of a typical strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their strawberry cousins, Alpine strawberries do not require an area of 
the garden that receives full sun. Four or five hours of sun per day is ample, 
and they do poorly in hot sections of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landscaping Tool 
</P>
<P>
Not only are Alpine strawberries a culinary delight, but they also are a most 
attractive landscaping item. Their foliage is a lighter shade of green than 
standard strawberries, and they form bushy 10-inch plants that are covered with 
pretty, white blossoms and deep-red or yellow fruit. 
</P>
<P>
When the berries form, they have a wild-fruit aroma that is absent in regular 
strawberries. They also differ from standard strawberries in that they don't 
form runners. They are beautiful plants to grow as borders in flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit of Alpine strawberries is slimmer, more pointed and only about a 
third the size of typical strawberries. Once established, Alpine strawberries 
will bear year round, with the heaviest crop in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Alpine strawberries can be grown from seeds or transplants. However, they are 
very expensive when sold as transplants. One mail-order seed firm offers 25 
plants for $26.95. If you use seeds, more varieties are available to you. 
</P>
<P>
You can sometimes locate seeds for Alpine strawberries in local nurseries. If 
not, Burpee Seeds, 300 Park Ave., Warminster, Pa. 18991, offers seeds for two 
superior Alpine strawberry varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandria produces a profusion of beautiful white blossoms and a bountiful 
crop of small, pointed red berries on bushy 10-inch plants. It is an old, 
reliable variety. Ruegen Improved is a newer variety with slightly larger 
berries, which are produced prolifically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Any Time of Year 
</P>
<P>
Alpine strawberries are perennials, but their production falters after the 
fourth year, when they should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
In our Southland climate, you can start seeds for Alpine strawberries at any 
time of the year. When you receive your seeds, plant them in pots indoors in a 
sunny window for subsequent transplanting into your garden. 
</P>
<P>
After the plants have grown to a height of 3 inches, they are ready to be 
planted outdoors. Before you transplant the plants, harden them by exposing 
them to the outdoors gradually -- a few hours each day for one week. 
</P>
<P>
Plants should be transplanted into a soil that has been enriched with organic 
material and a dressing of a general-purpose vegetable fertilizer. The plants 
should be spaced 6 inches apart and watered when transplanted. Then they should 
be irrigated on a weekly basis and given a side dressing of a fruit or 
vegetable fertilizer every four months. 
</P>
<P>
Alpine strawberries make a very attractive addition to a patio or balcony when 
they're grown in containers. If you go the container route, use a commercial 
potting-soil mix or make your own. 
</P>
<P>
Mix one-third builder's sand with one-third peat moss and one-third compost or 
well-aged manure. A time-released fertilizer should be added, and container 
strawberries should be fed a liquid fertilizer monthly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant in Containers 
</P>
<P>
You can plant one dozen Alpine strawberry plants in a large container such as a 
half whiskey barrel. Make certain that there are adequate drainage holes in the 
containers. Just about any type of container is suitable. 
</P>
<P>
A large container known as a strawberry pyramid can be purchased at some garden 
centers and from mail-order seed companies. It is circular and consists of 
three rings made of aluminum. The bottom ring is 6 feet in diameter, with two 
smaller rings stacked on top in pyramid fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Each band is 5 inches deep, and the pyramid contains a built-in sprayer that 
will connect to your garden hose. The pyramid will hold up to 50 plants. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit is ready for harvest when it has an intense wild-fruit fragrance. You 
won't have to bother about stems when you're picking, because the fruit 
separates from the calyx with very little effort when it is fully ripe. 
</P>
<P>
Forget about saving excess seeds from Alpine strawberries because they lose 
their germination potential very rapidly.

PUT SOME SPICE IN YOUR BACK YARD; 
</P>
<P>
FIVE PLANTS THAT CAN BE GROWN IN THIS CLIMATE AND LATER BE USED IN THE KITCHEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS, Sims is a free-lance writer living in Azalea, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back yards all over Southern California are sprouting basil and rosemary, 
lavender and thyme. But as popular as herb gardens are, many of us are 
overlooking spices. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, a spice is an herb, and vice versa; anything that enhances or 
"spices up" a dish is a spice. Over the centuries, people have tried to create 
finer distinctions; in England, a leaf is an herb, while a seed, stem or bark 
is a spice. 
</P>
<P>
The English blithely ignore the contradictions of coriander (the leaf, better 
known here as cilantro, is an herb by their definition, while the seed is a 
spice), dill, celery and mustard -- all leaf-and-seed double-duty edibles. 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle Ages, Europeans called anything a spice if it came from far away 
-- the Orient, the Indies. Pepper was such an expensive passion that Columbus 
sailed into the vast unknown just to find more (and maybe cheaper) pepper. 
</P>
<P>
In early American days, housewives hoarded their jars of precious powders, 
dragging them out only for holidays and very special occasions. While Colonial 
women (and men) grew herbs for medicine and taste, growing spices was 
unthinkable. Couldn't be done. 
</P>
<P>
But these days it can be done in Southern California -- or anywhere -- in a 
heated greenhouse. Here are five spices that can be easily accommodated in the 
warmest areas; one of which actually prefers a chill now and then: 
</P>
<P>
JUNIPER (Juniperus communis) is the hardiest spice on the list, native to 
Southern Europe, where it thrives in chalky soil. Plain old Juniperus communis 
is difficult to find in this country (almost all commercial berries are 
harvested in Italy and Yugoslavia), but there are several varieties that will 
grow here. 
</P>
<P>
'Hibernica' is a tall, straight, narrow column; 'Depressa' is a flat cushion. 
Variegated varieties are also available (most junipers come from wholesale-only 
nurseries in the Northwest; local nurseries can order them from Iseli Nursery, 
Boring, Ore., or Monrovia Nursery, Dayton, Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
Plant in the coolest part of the yard (if you live in the desert, don't even 
bother). Green berries will appear in the second year, but they will take at 
least two more years to ripen; when they finally turn blue, pick them and dry 
them in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
CINNAMON (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) trees can grow to about 35 feet. The spice is 
the bark of the tree, sold as rolled-up sticks, called quills, or ground. The 
bark is peeled from young shoots, about the size of a finger, using a 
lengthwise incision; as the bark dries, it curls up tightly. 
</P>
<P>
Logee's Greenhouse (141 North St., Danielson, Conn. 06239) sells cinnamon 
plants by mail -- $8 plus shipping for a small one. Cinnamon must be kept warm 
and wet. Logee's recommends using it only as a house plant, even in Southern 
California. The days are warm enough, but the nights are too cool. 
</P>
<P>
THE BRAZILIAN PEPPER TREE (Schinus terebinthifolius) is a popular street tree. 
Its fruit, pink peppercorns, are a comparatively recent food fad. It has a 
heavy, often twisted trunk and thick, dark green leaves that grow in leaflets. 
The peppercorns turn red in the winter, fading slightly as they are processed. 
</P>
<P>
They are not dried and ground like black pepper. Commercially, they are 
preserved in water or pickled, and are used most often in sauces for meats. 
Proceed with caution, however, some people are allergic to the peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
CARDAMOM (Elettaria cardamomum) is a tropical plant, originating in India, 
Ceylon and Malaysia and cultivated on India's Malabar coast and in Guatemala, 
where it gets up to 150 inches of rainfall a year. You might keep a plant or 
two in a sunny window or greenhouse. There are three kinds of cardamom seed -- 
large and green, small and black, tiny and dark brown. Cardamom is usually sold 
in pods. 
</P>
<P>
I have yet to find a commercial source for the seed, so I buy the pods in 
ethnic grocery stores (Indian, Jewish, Armenian, Asian). Break the pods open 
and plant the seeds that fall out. Keep the seeds warm and moist. Be patient. 
Germination is very haphazard. Cardamom trees can grow to 7 feet (less in a 
container), and they form a thick bulb-like root. Assuming the seeds do 
germinate, it will be a few years before the pods can be harvested. Once they 
do, you will have a continuous supply of this spice. 
</P>
<P>
SAFFRON (Crocus sativa), the world's most expensive spice, grows fairly well in 
Southern California and is generally available in catalogues and nurseries. The 
saffron strands are very difficult to extract from the plant (tweezers are a 
necessity), but considering what it costs to buy if you don't grow your own, a 
little kneeling and tweezing is not out of order.

DANDELION CAN MAKE A TONIC, TEA OR SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, myriad products have been deeloped to get rid of dandelions. 
But like most plants that are considered weeds, they keep coming back, not even 
needing to be pollinated to keep renewing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans brought the dandelion here because they knew its value. Dandelion 
leaf tea has long been popular and is considered a tonic. The roots can be used 
as a base for tea also, which was frequently used for heartburn. The leaves are 
edible and are loaded with vitamin A. The contain nearly four times as much 
Vitamin C as lettuce or most leafy vegetables. They even have more iron than 
spinach. 
</P>
<P>
Tea is hardly the end of uses for this yellow flower. Since the dandelion 
flowers from March until September, it is an excellent plant to use to help 
keep bees around so that they will pollinate all of our other flowers and 
fruiting plants. When the flowers are boiled, it is possible the get a yellow 
dye. The roots will produce a magenta dye when boiled. 
</P>
<P>
Wine can be made from the blossoms and a coffee-like drink can be made from 
dried, ground and roasted roots. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dandelions we see in our yards are edible and can fill all of 
these requirements and usages, commercially grown dandelions have larger and 
thicker leaves. 
</P>
<P>
If you purchase seeds and wish to grow your own, you will find they grow "just 
like a weed," as you suspected. However, you can tie the leaves together so 
that the leaves are rather bleached in appearance. This allows you to use them 
much like endive.

BUYING A HOME OR CONDO WITHIN FHA LOAN LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FHA loans are 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that are available to anyone with 
the income and credit needed to qualify. They are insured by the FHA and funded 
by approved banks, savings and loans, mortgage companies and other lending 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
To buy a home with an FHA loan, you must find a piece of property that is in 
the $101,250 range of the funding limit. It must qualify for FHA financing in 
terms of its condition and the relationship of the asking price to the 
appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
If you are considering buying a condominium or townhouse, you can check with 
your agent or the homeowners association to see if the property is in an 
FHA-approved complex. Title companies will provide lists of such properties. 
</P>
<P>
If you are seeking a single-family home, the property will have to be in 
suitable shape to pass the FHA inspection and be priced in line with the market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you have the cash needed to close the purchase. Together with the 
down payment and the closing costs, it will cost you anywhere from about $5,000 
to $8,000 in cash to buy a property close to the FHA limit. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've saved the amount for closing costs and located the property, find a 
bank or lending institution that offers FHA loans by consulting with your 
agent, checking with a loan broker or turning to the telephone directory and 
making some calls. 
</P>
<P>
With some FHA loans, depending on the type of property purchased, an up-front 
fee of as much as $4,000 will be charged for mortgage insurance, but that 
charge can be added to the amount of loan financed, as can the 1% origination 
fee charged for the loan. Both charges can be added on top of the maximum 
$101,250 loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
With most FHA condo loans, the mortgage insurance is charged as a monthly fee 
of about $40. 
</P>
<P>
Discount points may be charged by the lender and are paid by either the buyer 
or the seller in an FHA transaction. Usually, you'll have the option of taking 
a higher interest rate with no points or a lower rate with points. The length 
of time you plan to hold the property and the amount of cash available at 
closing usually determine which route is best for you. 
</P>
<P>
FHA loans require tax impounds, which add about $105 to the monthly payment. 
Together with $889 a month for principal and interest on a 10%, fixed-rate 
loan, and $40 for mortgage insurance, the total monthly payment comes to about 
$1,034 for an FHA loan of $101,250. WILLIAM MAHONEY

FHA financing -- An Aug. 27 article on buying with FHA financing stated that 
the 1% origination fee can be added to the loan. However, the fee can only be 
added if it does not exceed the FHA's loan limit of $101,250.

GARDENA LAW WINS PRAISE; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCING RULES AMONG BEST IN U.S., PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The city of Gardena's campaign finance ordinance was praised as one of the most 
innovative in the country in a report released today by the California 
Commission on Campaign Financing. 
</P>
<P>
A provision of the ordinance that prohibits city contractors from donating to 
political campaigns "has apparently helped to relieve elected officials from 
political pressures regarding contracts and has improved residents' perception 
of city government," the report found. "A law similar to Gardena's might be an 
appropriate addition in every city, regardless of size." 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere in the ordinance, the study said, Gardena needs to clarify one 
provision and close a loophole in another that threatens to undermine the 
effectiveness of the 1976 ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The 373-page report, the first in the country to examine campaign finance 
practices at the state and city level, is the result of a three-year study of 
campaign financing in Los Angeles County. The commission is a nonprofit, 
bipartisan political watchdog group that is not affiliated with state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities examined in the study include Los Angeles, Long Beach, Santa 
Monica, Pasadena, Signal Hill, Agoura Hills and West Covina. Los Angeles County 
was also studied. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-page chapter on Gardena covers the history of campaign finances in the 
city, from the political influence of the card clubs beginning in the 1930s, to 
the decline of the gambling industry and the adoption in 1976 of the current 
ground-breaking campaign finance ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidates Receive List 
</P>
<P>
The report lauded the provision of the ordinance that prohibits contributions 
from city contractors as the first of its kind in California. Only four other 
California cities -- Poway, South San Francisco, Belmont and Rancho Mirage -- 
have since adopted similar restrictions, the report found. Gardena broadly 
defines contractors to include all vendors whose contracts require City Council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
In enforcing the ordinance in Gardena, the city issues a list of contractors 
who are prohibited from making donations. "When we become candidates, we're 
given a list to know who not to accept funds from," said Mayor Donald Dear. 
</P>
<P>
But the report found that a loophole in the ordinance allows candidates to 
circumvent a $500 limit on individual contributions and receive loans far 
greater than that amount. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the study cited a $10,000 loan Councilman James Cragin received 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Cragin's campaign statements from the 1984 election show that he received a 
$10,000 loan from his campaign manager, Gardena businessman Tom Spears, and 
Carol Ann Howz, whose occupation is listed as housewife. He also loaned himself 
$1,800, campaign statements indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Cragin was unavailable for comment. Spears declined to comment, saying he had 
not seen the commission report. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials said loans to candidates have never been an issue in city 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a problem with it," said City Manager Kenneth Landau. 
Candidates' practice of borrowing campaign funds from themselves or other 
sources is "fairly common," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Michael Karger said it is "perfectly legal under our ordinance to 
give loans in excess of $500 because it's not a contribution if the loan is 
paid back." If a loan is not paid back, however, the amount of the loan 
exceeding $500 would be considered a contribution and would be illegal under 
the Gardena ordinance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Cragin had paid off both of the 1984 loans. 
</P>
<P>
Dear, who said he serves as his own campaign treasurer, acknowledged that there 
is "a loophole on the loans that I wasn't aware of." 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended that Gardena broaden its contribution limit to apply 
to such loans, although it did not specify what the limit on the loans should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found the ordinance ambiguous as to whether candidates must 
disclose contributions of $50 or more, or whether they need to disclose only 
contributions of $100 or more, as required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission urges that the ordinance be clarified," the report read. "The 
$50 limit is in tune with the city's existing contribution patterns." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance bans "individual anonymous contributions of $50 or more." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stern, a spokesman for the commission, said in an interview that the 
provision could be interpreted to allow a candidate to accept a donation larger 
than $50 and call it anonymous even if he knows who the donor is. 
</P>
<P>
However, Karger said the $50 disclosure limit is made clear to candidates in 
election-year seminars he leads along with City Clerk May Doi. Candidates are 
advised to disclose all contributions of more than $50 to the city and to 
disclose contributions greater than $100 to the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Karger said he would study the report's recommendations. "If it 
warrants a change, I'll bring it up before the council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attention on Fukai 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the report, Councilman Mas Fukai is a focus of attention. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites Fukai, chief deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn, for his "tremendous fund-raising resources" and his influence on Gardena 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Fukai "has gained a reputation as a consummate fund-raiser and 
supporter of local Asian political candidates. . . . Although his proteges have 
not yet been successful in Gardena, his fund-raising muscle appears to have 
threatened his peers on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai declined to be interviewed by the commission, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We called him many times and even talked to him once, and he said he'd get 
back to us but he never did," said commission spokesman Stern. 
</P>
<P>
But Fukai said he did not recall being contacted by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, why would I refuse?" Fukai asked. "I would be happy to talk to them 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai, who introduced Gardena's landmark campaign finance ordinance, 
acknowledged that he is a strong presence in Gardena politics and that he has 
campaigned for Asian-American and other candidates in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent council race, in 1986, Fukai raised more than $57,000. 
Incumbents in Gardena typically raise about half that amount. Fukai said 
substantial funding was necessary to fight off a strong challenge by Terry 
Kennedy, a community activist who won 18.7% of the vote that year, placing 
third in the race for two seats. Councilwoman Gwen Duffy was the biggest 
vote-getter with 31.1%, and Fukai was reelected with 28.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"I do question whether (my) fund raising is a threat" to other Gardena council 
members, Fukai said. "I think the council gets along so well in Gardena, 
including the mayor, that I don't think there's any threat." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai said he has met many of his political supporters through his work as 
Hahn's deputy. "Certainly being with Mr. Hahn has not hurt me when it comes to 
raising funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the report characterized the city of about 51,000 as a place where 
political campaigning is "low-tech, home-style, grass-roots." Incumbents are 
usually heavily favored, political newcomers must run repeatedly to win a seat 
and campaign expenditures "reflect the old-fashioned nature of local politics," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, individual political contributions make up 61% of all 
contributions in Gardena, compared to 45% for other small cities, the report 
found. Most of that money is spent on a mix of newspaper and outdoor 
advertising, with about 69% going toward literature such as political mailers. 
In other small cities, candidates spend about 85% of their funds on literature, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Changes Recommended 
</P>
<P>
The chapter concludes by recommending two changes to the Gardena ordinance: 
limiting the amount of loans candidates can receive, and clarifying the minimum 
disclosure amount for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, city officials said, the assessment of Gardena seemed fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased Gardena is put in a positive vein," Dear said. 
</P>
<P>
Landau said the city would study the report. "Obviously there are some areas 
(in the ordinance) we want to look at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city administrative staff "may be making some recommendations to the 
council in the future" based on the report, he said.

SCHEDULE PRESENTS FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE

<P>
Care to schedule a nonleague game against a team from the Golden League? How 
'bout it, all you Southern California high school football programs? Step right 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone want a shot at Antelope Valley? A crack at Canyon? A piece of Palmdale? 
</P>
<P>
The three teams were a combined 32-9 last season and comprised three of the 
final four in the Southern Section Division II playoffs. Antelope Valley, which 
finished second in the league, defeated league-champion Canyon, 28-22, for the 
Division II title. But only by whipping Palmdale, 23-13, in the semifinal did 
the Antelopes earn the opportunity to avenge their only league loss of the 
season to the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, it's just one of the strongest leagues in California," 
eighth-year Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. "Consistently, year after year. But 
people don't want to play us." 
</P>
<P>
Which can lead to difficulty when scheduling time rolls around. Welch 
admittedly would prefer to schedule a few "breathers," but can't seem to find 
any. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, surprisingly, can Quartz Hill Coach John Albee. The Rebels finished 
3-7 and last in the Golden League at 0-5 last season. But for some, a match-up 
with the league's last-place team hasn't exactly been deemed, well, a golden 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just aren't too many teams that want to play a Golden League team," 
said Albee who, in his 22nd season at Quartz Hill, is something of a Golden 
oldie. "We call them up and say we would like to play them. They say, 'We'll 
keep you in mind,' and then you never hear from them again." 
</P>
<P>
That's probably because they have heard of the Golden League: Antelope Valley, 
Burroughs (Ridgecrest), Canyon, Palmdale, Quartz Hill and Saugus. Through the 
past decade, the league has grown in strength, mirroring the growth of the 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, which continue to supply the area with 
talented players. 
</P>
<P>
Rooted firmly in fertile football ground, the Golden League has grown to become 
possibly the best of five Southern Section Division II leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley has won two conference championships in the 1980s -- four since 
1976 -- and has reached the final three times. The Antelopes have qualified for 
the playoffs every year since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which has virtually owned the league in Welch's seven-year tenure, is 
34-1 in league play and has won six league titles since 1982. Canyon posted 
consecutive conference titles from 1983-85, while reaching the semifinals in 
'86 and '87 and the final last season. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the Cowboys' famed 46-game winning streak from 1983-86, which 
tied a Southern Section record. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the final season of the decade, Antelope Valley (83-28-1 in the '80s) 
and Canyon (91-22) undoubtedly will remain conference powerhouses. Palmdale 
(9-4 last season), which lost only to Antelope Valley (twice), Canyon and 
Crespi, a Del Rey League power, should also emerge a legitimate conference 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our league can play against anybody," Antelope Valley Coach Brent 
Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell: "All we can do is prepare for our 
league schedule. They play some pretty tough football up here." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the bottom of the pack. Three different teams -- Quartz Hill, Burroughs 
and Saugus -- have finished last in the past three years. Albee, who last 
fashioned a league title in 1980, insists Quartz Hill will not break that 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been down the last couple years," he said. "But if everything goes 
right, we should be a playoff team." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it might be too early to discuss playoffs. Or even league titles. But 
nonleague schedules are a hot topic among league coaches. Exactly who do you 
play when your first choice is choosy? 
</P>
<P>
Teams that are, according to Welch, "too good." This season, every Golden 
League team will play a challenging nonleague schedule which collectively 
features some of the best teams in Southern and Central California. 
</P>
<P>
An overview of the six teams' nonleague lineups: 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley (12-2 last season) plays Foothill of Bakersfield, West 
Bakersfield, Redlands, Loyola and El Toro -- a combined 34-23 last season. 
Loyola, the defending Del Rey League champion, was 12-1 and reached the 
Division I semifinals. West Bakersfield (9-4) was the runner-up for the Central 
Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
Said Newcomb: "We don't duck anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Palmdale. The Falcons open against Muir, then play Chaminade, 
Hart, Alemany and Pasadena -- a combined 33-23 last season. Muir (8-4) and 
Pasadena (7-4) were Pacific League co-champions. Chaminade reached the Division 
VII quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The league's bottom three teams (by last year's records) also face difficult 
schedules, especially considering their performances last year. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill plays South Bakersfield, Burroughs (Burbank), Hesperia, Cajon and 
Hart -- a combined 27-26 last year. However, Cajon (8-4) is the defending San 
Andreas League champion and Burroughs (6-4) reached the Northwestern Conference 
final in 1987 before slipping to fourth in the competitive Foothill League last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Only Burroughs (Ridgecrest) plays a nonleague schedule consisting of teams with 
a combined losing record. Barstow, Bishop, North Bakersfield, Hesperia and 
Wasco of Central California were 21-27-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Saugus might be facing the most difficult nonleague lineup in Coach Dick 
Flaherty's three-year tenure. The Centurions, 1-8-1 last season and 5-24-1 the 
past three years, play South Pasadena, Alemany, Hawthorne, Hart and St. Francis 
-- a combined 27-27-1 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne (8-3-1) finished second in the Bay League and lost to Canyon, 29-14, 
in the quarterfinals. St. Francis (4-7) finished third in the Del Rey League 
behind Loyola and Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus, which has avoided a last-place finish under Flaherty, might enter 
league play somewhat battered. "And Harry talks about his schedule," Flaherty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears, however, that Welch and the Cowboys will lock horns with the 
toughest competition of all. After the traditional opener against Foothill 
League rival Hart, Canyon suits up against Bakersfield, Thousand Oaks, Notre 
Dame and Mission Viejo -- a combined 45-13-1 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, which defeated Canyon, 28-20, last season, finished 13-0 and 
defeated West Bakersfield for the Central Section championship. Mission Viejo 
(12-1) is the defending South Coast champion. Thousand Oaks (6-4-1), which 
finished second in the Marmonte League, was Coastal Conference champion in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (8-3) is the defending San Fernando Valley League champion. And 
Hart, which should rebound from a disappointing 6-5 season, has defeated Canyon 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Golden League teams, a combined 41-29-1 last season, will face 
nonleague opponents with a combined 161-112-3 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
But league coaches wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you get any better playing any lesser teams," Newcomb said. "You 
don't want to play people you can beat all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, in fact, insists that a difficult nonleague season leads to an easier 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
"If you play a good team in the playoffs -- if you get that far -- it's not 
that big an adjustment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on recent success, it is a good bet that three Golden League teams will 
make that adjustment this fall.

<P>
Two exhibitions at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art bring shadowed 
thoughts to the bright beachside town. One show is the 1989 edition of Awards 
in the Visual Arts, that regional U.S. survey that last year included a 
now-notorious photograph by Andres Serrano provocatively titled "Piss Christ." 
</P>
<P>
As every reader of culture columns now knows, that photograph, along with the 
elegant, sometimes kinky, oeuvre of the late Robert Mapplethorpe, is the 
centerpiece of a political controversy that threatens the independence -- if 
not the very existence -- of the National Endowment for the Arts. Lawmakers 
including the influential Sen. Jesse Helms (Rep.-N.C.) have proposed 
legislation to prevent the endowment from backing art they regard as offensive, 
thus rekindling all the usual fears of official censorship and all the familiar 
arguments about whether or not tax dollars ought to be used to foster art that 
most Americans neither like nor understand. 
</P>
<P>
If this ominous fuss were not under way, there would be no reason to look at 
the AVA exhibition or the accompanying installation by British conceptual 
artist Richard Long as anything other than the aesthetic events they in fact 
represent. (Both run to Oct. 15.) Neither Long nor any of the 10 artists 
selected by the AVA appear to be out to scandalize anyone, but in the present 
climate of touchy self-righteousness it is impossible to look at any of this 
work without imagining people who would find every bit of it an occasion for 
indignation. The worst thing about an atmosphere of official coercion is a 
created paranoia that distracts from one's own reality -- a kind of invasion of 
artistic privacy. The best thing it spawns are opportunities for rueful humor. 
</P>
<P>
Long, born in Bristol in 1945, is presently artist-in-residence at the museum. 
His work has long been familiar on the international circuit, where it shows up 
in summer extravaganzas from Kassel to Venice. This year he was one of the few 
bright, apt spots in the sprawling, disastrous "Magicians of the Earth" at 
Paris' Pompidou Center. It is no trouble to conjure up a host of folks to wax 
huffy at his art. Here it consists -- characteristically -- of two circles of 
massed stones about 12 feet across, two wall compositions painted with 
terra-cotta slip applied by hand (one doughnut circle, one long rectangle) and 
two compositions of listed words. Long's natural predators are, of course, 
those legions of citizens who know on sight that this sort of thing is not art. 
</P>
<P>
Of course they are right, except for one crucial caveat, which is that stone 
circles, mud smears and lists are not necessarily art. Neither, for that 
matter, are huge canvases bursting with cupids, naked goddesses and armored 
heroes. Artworks become art only when they transcend the simple facts of their 
existence, and they can do that only when they blend with the sensibility of 
the viewer. It's chemistry in the same way love is chemistry and just as 
fraught with anxiety over ambiguities of meaning and authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Long's wordworks paint an image of him as an aesthetic nomad seeking art in 
primitive nature. One uses arrows to diagram wind direction during 20 days when 
the artist walked 560 miles across Spain and Portugal; the other is called 
"Early Morning Senses" and consists of a list of words he associated with 
strolls on tropical Frigate Island in the Indian Ocean -- words like Sun / Damp 
Dust / Cock Crows / Guano / Coco Plum. The pieces seem to want to be poetry but 
they are too skeletal for me. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, his slip painting of a circle the size of a crane tire is 
magisterial. It appears to spin on account of splatters off its edges. Subtle 
handling of scrubby surface lends an illusion of dimensional solidity. Besides, 
it's sheerly beautiful with drawing as inevitable as Oriental ink splash 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Long's stone circles appear randomly arranged but he must have done something 
right because they transform themselves, evoking Stonehenge and Zen Gardens at 
once. One is made of buff-colored Utah sandstone marbled with pink which seems 
to change from a desert landscape to a sea of flower petals. The other -- in 
dark Baja La Cresta granite -- metamorphoses from a forbidding mountain range 
into a lake of molten bronze. The whole jells into an aesthetic that finds the 
magic of art in human reverence for nature. Corporations that pollute the 
environment should either flee from it like a vampire from a cross or patronize 
it to polish up their image. 
</P>
<P>
Long's work would surely set off the old it-looks-too-easy-I-could-do-it-myself 
reaction in his imagined detractors. In reality, of course, it's much tougher 
than it looks, apparent effortlessness being a mark of mastery. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, virtually all the AVA work is still struggling for Long's kind of 
seamless integration. Although one feels very protective of the AVA in its 
current travail, the truth is that its mandate -- scouring 10 regions of the 
country for worthy talent -- sometimes turns up art that has not quite as yet 
found itself or is possessed by the kind of cranky self-defeating individuality 
associated with provincialism. (In this regard it is probably significant to 
note that Serrano did not get in the soup over his murky image of a plastic 
crucifix in an ambiguous liquid but over its title, which was either 
questionably naive or an invitation to trouble.) 
</P>
<P>
None of which is grounds for shooting the messenger. Shows like AVA are 
artistic forums. Debate over their content is crucially appropriate because it 
vivifies the work -- but only as long as the wrangle remains in the realm of 
intellectual discussion where it belongs. Taking real legislative action 
against these fantasies is wacky. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing would be OK. 
</P>
<P>
At Germany's Documenta exhibition, citizens -- usually excluded artists -- 
often picket the survey in pious political accents: Why are these East German 
Commies included? Why Ignore the Good Old Boys for these International Fops? 
</P>
<P>
It makes a nice carnival atmosphere, shows the art is taken seriously and is 
completely harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the National Rifle Assn. should picket the AVA exhibition. James Drake 
from El Paso shows painted copies of Goya, Delacroix and Boucher mounted on 
steel plates and juxtaposed with model rifles associating sexual and religious 
repression with violence and violence with firearms, which are, of course, in 
reality only used for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace industry might demonstrate against the effrontery of Charles 
Wilson who hails from Evanston, Ill. He makes fragments of aircraft out of wire 
or plexiglass and puts them with neon signs -- like "Berlin Desire" -- which 
suggest that airplanes are used in nuclear war. My own placard will read, 
"Looks Too Much Like Bruce Nauman." 
</P>
<P>
The works of Paul Kos, Roy Fondaw and Patrick T. Dougherty were not fully 
installed during an exhibition preview. Fondaw appears politically neutral 
unless there is an Ant-Funk Society. Dougherty makes sculpture by 
</P>
<P>
wrapping live foliage. The work looks pro-environment so The Society for the 
Destruction of the Amazon Rain Forest should be on alert. One of Kos' pieces 
incorporates a bell and an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe so atheists can 
charge it with unfairly promoting religion. There must also be people who are 
incensed by virginity. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of religion, the drawings and sculpture of Anne McCoy deal with 
spiritual beliefs so old we call them myths. Huge drawings in colored pencil 
depict -- among other things -- a fish-headed god in a classical landscape 
where fetuses sleep in floating wombs. The meaning of this image is so superbly 
unclear that both pro-choice and anti-abortion forces could probably find 
reason to hate it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you get the idea. We live in an ambiance that appears to seek occasions 
for hostility, causing art to be perceived in ways that utterly miss the point. 
David Hammons shows scruffy fetish sculptures that employ cast-off black sheet 
rubber to bring together the traditions of African tribal art with urban 
American junk sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Fraga makes dingy, naive reliquary paintings desperately dreaming of sweet 
magic in Detroit. Jo Anne Callis is trying to turn black-and-white photography 
into a Post-Modernist stew of Expressionism and Neo-Classicism. Eric Levine's 
abstract sculpture is a particularly keen blend of geometry and organic 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
It's just art. What good is it if there is no reason to haul it into court?

BUILDING A NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT JOHNSON IS POSITIONING HIS CABLE COMPANY TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF BLACK 
MEDIA. 
</P>

A few years after founding Washington-based Black Entertainment Television in 
1980, owner Robert Johnson boasted that the nation's only black-owned cable 
network -- then barely breaking even with B-movies and music videos -- would be 
showing more costly dramatic series and soap operas "as early as 1986." 
</P>
<P>
But even though the low-cost programming had made BET profitable by 1986, the 
promise of original shows aimed at black audiences eluded BET's financial 
capabilities until this year when the network opened a $10-million studio and 
unveiled plans to air eight new shows, beginning Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
With most of the nation now wired for cable television reception, Black 
Entertainment Television stands poised to become one of the most influential 
black-oriented media at a time when companies are targeting ethnic markets to 
increase sales. Many marketers have recently begun to focus a larger share of 
their advertising efforts on the nation's more than 28 million black consumers, 
who control an estimated $240 billion in yearly income. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why BET cannot become the dominant place where blacks get 
their entertainment and also pull a significant crossover audience" of 
non-black viewers, Johnson said. For years, he added, "the industry undervalued 
the black consumer marketplace." Cable is now expanding in urban markets "where 
blacks are concentrated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Available in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
Considered a long-shot business venture when it began, BET has become a 
full-fledged 24-hour network. Its current lineup of videos, college sports 
coverage, movies, news and talk shows -- though sometimes criticized as 
uninspired -- is carried by about 1,300 of the nation's 9,300 cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
Many new systems with large channel capacity carry BET, including some in 
mostly white areas such as Orange County. However, the network is not offered 
full time by many older systems including, surprisingly, the 31-channel system 
that serves predominantly black Harlem, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have very high viewership," explained Robert G. Benya, vice 
president of marketing of Paragon Cable in Manhattan. "We haven't received 
anywhere near the number of calls for BET that we received for (cable networks) 
Lifetime or the Disney Channel." 
</P>
<P>
Still, BET reaches nearly 24 million households nationwide and has a prime time 
rating of 0.7. That means that between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., its shows, on 
average, are watched by more than 150,000 households, making BET's audience 
larger than that for video music channel Video Hits One (VH-1) or the Weather 
Channel, but far smaller than that for MTV and the entertainment and arts 
Discovery channel. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson expects BET's ratings to improve dramatically in the next few years as 
cable systems expand in urban areas such as South Central Los Angeles, New 
York's outer boroughs and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Rising 
</P>
<P>
Already, BET is commanding higher fees for its programs. Cable networks derive 
their income from the monthly fee that cable operators charge subscribers as 
well as from advertising. On Jan. 1, cable operators began paying BET 5 cents 
per household, twice the previous rate. And the rate will increase by a penny 
in each of the next five years, bringing BET about $75 million in revenue 
during the period. 
</P>
<P>
"We feature BET as part of our marketing strategy in our direct-mail campaign," 
said Perry Parks, district manager of Continental Cablevision of South Central 
Los Angeles, which is being wired for cable. "We did a viewer study and found 
that BET was one of the most highly watched and highly valued of the 
(52-channel) cable services we offer." 
</P>
<P>
For Johnson, who started BET with a $15,000 personal bank loan and a $500,000 
investment from cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., the formula for success 
has been a simple one: "What John Malone (president of Tele-Communications) 
told me when he first invested was 'keep your revenues up and your costs down,' 
" Johnson said. "The fact that we've been able to run BET in a cost-conscious 
fashion is just going to do wonders for us now that we have some dollars." 
</P>
<P>
BET's frugality, however, hasn't yet paid off for its three major investors -- 
Tele-Communications, Great American Broadcasting Co. and Time Warner Inc.'s pay 
cable unit, Home Box Office, which together have $10 million in the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not recovered all of the money from our investment," said Bob 
Thompson, a vice president of Tele-Communications. But he added that because 
Tele-Communications is a major cable operator, it receives "an indirect benefit 
from increases in (BET's cable) penetration due to its programming designed 
specifically for urban audiences." 
</P>
<P>
It remains an open question, however, whether BET's new program strategy will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The new $10-million studio and the creation of more original programming will 
mean higher operating costs. Most of the programs will be produced by BET's 
staff, including two new talk shows, "Our Voices" and "Teen Summit." Johnson 
insists that such "reality-based programming" will be the key to BET's future 
success. But some say the new shows mimic existing syndicated black-oriented 
talk shows such as "Tony Brown's Journal" and "Ebony Showcase." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, adds Merrill Brown, editor of Channels, a New York-based magazine 
covering the broadcasting industry, advertisers' appetite for original 
black-oriented programming is unproven. However, the network has attracted a 
surprisingly varied group of advertisers thus far, including Procter &amp; 
Gamble, General Motors and Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Brown said, BET probably will need to modify its format because "videos 
are no way to build audience loyalty today when you can watch them on MTV and 
network TV." 
</P>
<P>
Some independent black producers who might offer BET an alternative to its 
current programming say they have had no success getting BET to back their 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total Control 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dawson, a black producer in Los Angeles who helped develop several 
network television shows while an executive at Universal Television in the 
mid-1980s, said he has been rebuffed twice by BET after approaching them with 
project proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Black producers by and large don't have anything good to say about BET," 
Dawson said. "Bob has all kinds of excuses about why black producers don't get 
on BET. But what he wants is total control of everything that goes on the air 
from his own home base in Washington, D.C. There's nothing wrong with that. I 
just think he's limiting himself in terms of how successful he ultimately might 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Topper Carew, a black Hollywood film maker who produced the movie "D.C. Cab" as 
well as several television shows, including a recent comedy special for BET, is 
more circumspect. But he also feels that BET could improve its relationship 
with the black entertainment community. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a comedy special for them that was well received by the audience, but I 
have not heard from BET since the show was aired" this spring, Carew said. 
"There is a market for black (TV) products, and it's a fairly large market. I 
don't know why" there's a hesitancy to air the work of independent black 
producers, he added. "You have to ask them (BET) that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson readily admits a distaste for Hollywood and the West in general. Aware 
that he's speaking to a Los Angeles audience, he nonetheless declares that 
"black culture really resides . . . in New York, Atlanta, D.C., Philly -- the 
Eastern seaboard." Johnson also admits to having a greater interest in the 
business side of television than in programming. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself as a programming genius or get excited about sitting around 
with Hollywood types talking about programming," Johnson explained. "The middle 
name of (BET) is still entertainment and the programming is going to be 
entertaining. But it's not going to be car chases . . . nor is it going to be 
laugh track comedies, which is what you see in black programming" on network 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
Some agree with Johnson's emphasis on costs and revenue over art. 
</P>
<P>
"Black producers want Bob to go and do all the work; they only want to be 
involved in the creative process," said Ken Smikle, editor of Target Market 
News, a Chicago-based publication that covers the black consumer market. "That 
won't work in today's competitive environment. They have to learn to barter 
their programs and get sponsorship like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Though BET will not disclose figures, industry analyst Larry Gerbrandt of Paul 
Kagan Associates estimates that in 1989 the network will realize $4 million in 
operating cash flow on $23 million in revenue. (Operating cash flow is revenue 
less expenses, before interest, depreciation and taxes.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Launching New Magazine 
</P>
<P>
Such estimates pale beside those of bigger cable networks such as ESPN, which 
is expected to rake in $100 million this year. But, Gerbrandt said, for niche 
programming "they do OK." 
</P>
<P>
Doing OK is not enough for Johnson, however. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, he plans to begin publishing an upscale, black-oriented magazine, 
"Emerge," in a joint venture with Time Warner Inc. and Syndicated 
Communications Inc., a venture capital firm in Washington. He said he also 
wants to set up a production company one day. 
</P>
<P>
"What I see is positioning the company as a media company," Johnson explained. 
"I basically want BET to become the dominant black media company in the world."

There are likely to be more new cases of AIDS among drug addicts than among 
homosexual men in the next two years as the focus of the epidemic increasingly 
shifts to poor, drug-ridden urban neighborhoods, researchers predicted at a 
Washington meeting. Over 40% of reported AIDS cases have occurred in blacks and 
Latinos, although the two groups constitute only about 20% of the U.S. 
population, said Dr. Harold Jaffe of the federal Centers for Disease Control, 
adding that this is because the vast majority of drug addicts with AIDS are 
black or Latino and because infected addicts often transmit the virus to their 
sexual partners or unborn infants. A mathematical analysis suggests that about 
1.2 million people carry the AIDS virus, and nearly half of those infected are 
black or Latino, said Philip S. Rosenberg of the NCI.

The operator of Pennsylvania's Limerick 2 nuclear plant was granted a 
full-power license after agreeing to make nearly $2 million in modifications to 
bolster the plant's ability to withstand a severe accident. The $2.9-billion 
reactor had been in the planning and construction stages for 20 years. Before 
the 4-0 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Philadelphia Electric, the 
plant's operator, and the citizens' group Limerick Ecology Action reached 
agreement in a dispute that threatened to send the parties to court. LEA had 
been pressing for possible design changes to lessen the risk and environmental 
impact of a severe accident. Philadelphia Electric agreed to make two plant 
modifications, evaluate others and allow an LEA safety expert on a review team 
to study risk reduction efforts at Limerick. The modifications were not 
required by the NRC.

2 COUPLES DINE A LA OIL TANKER

The Martins and the Utechts arrived at the dock gate in a cream-colored Jaguar, 
ready to be whisked aboard the huge, multimillion-dollar ship for their $400 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
They had waited months for this. "I don't know of anyone else who's done it," 
Francis Utecht said. 
</P>
<P>
The menu for this intimate supper for four had been created just that morning. 
It featured chicken a la king, steak, pork chops, fried onions, salad with 
Wishbone dressing and chocolate chip ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room's major decorative motif was vinyl. The place mats were red 
plastic, which accented the red in the Del Monte ketchup bottle in the middle 
of the white table cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The waitress wore slacks, a pullover and a white jacket with frayed, cut-off 
sleeves. There was no maitre d' and no sommelier. 
</P>
<P>
But then, this was the Arco Alaska, and Dorothy and Al Martin and Grace and 
Francis Utecht, neighbors in Naples, one of Long Beach's posh addresses, were 
getting exactly what they had paid for: dinner on an oil tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The Utechts bid for the meal and a tour of the ship at a local Legal Aid 
Foundation fund-raising auction last spring, paying $400 for the dinner, which 
had been donated to Legal Aid by Arco Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Arco Alaska is no play ship and the visitors did not play. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker is all muscle, nearly a fifth of a mile long, with enough girth to 
haul more than a million gallons of crude oil down the Pacific Coast from 
Valdez, Alaska, to Long Beach's refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Activities before dinner included a 90-minute inspection of pumps, pipes, the 
decidedly unluxurious living quarters of the 25-member crew, and the bridge. 
After dinner, the guests descended to the heat and clamor of the boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
The meal lasted about 30 minutes. The captain had gone ashore to have dinner 
with his family before the ship's departure for Alaska in the middle of the 
night. There were not even any oil-spill jokes about the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you recommend?" Dorothy Martin inquired of the waitress, a former 
office manager from Seattle lured to the Arco Alaska by the 45 paid days off 
she gets after 75 days on board. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the steak looks good. Actually it all does," replied Michelle Campbell, 
the waitress, who said the fare on the Alaska "is as good as I eat at home." 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a pork chop in ages," Martin remarked. She later declared the 
food "delicious." For dessert she ordered cake with chocolate frosting. 
Everyone else had ice cream from a selection in the dining room freezer. 
</P>
<P>
As boat lovers, the couples were intrigued by the idea of seeing the inner 
workings of one of the huge tankers that dwarf their pleasure craft in Long 
Beach Harbor. The Martins have a 53-foot sailboat and the Utechts have several 
boats. Al Martin, an architect, had a further interest in the tanker. He has 
designed several buildings for Arco, including the company's downtown office 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth more than my money's worth," Utecht, a patent attorney, said of 
his three hours on the ship. "That's something the average person can't buy."

BILL, SOUTH GATE'S MELLOW POLICE DOG, RETIRES AFTER 5 YEARS OF HOT PURSUITS 
</P>

SOUTH GATE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he joined the South Gate Police Department five years ago, there was some 
doubt that Bill, the German shepherd, was suited for police work. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there were a few occasions when he showed no aggression, simply 
walking away from suspects. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the time the 85-pound dog was chased by a goose. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the administrators wanted to get rid of him," said Police Officer 
Frank LaVigne, the dog's handler. 
</P>
<P>
But that is all behind Bill now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Chases 
</P>
<P>
After extra hours of training by LaVigne, the dog proved his worth during more 
than five years of chasing criminals. In more than 100 searches for suspects, 
Bill was successful in 65 of them, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
So earlier this month, when the 9-year-old dog retired, he got his retirement 
party, just like all other Police Department retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Top police officials, including Police Chief Ron George, and LaVigne were there 
to help celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The dog, who is suffering from arthritic-type problems in his joints, received 
his share of presents. 
</P>
<P>
There was a 12-by-18-inch white cake. Bill had several pieces. And he was given 
a city fire hydrant. Bill rarely passed a hydrant he did not make use of during 
his career, LaVigne said. However, he did manage to resist the bright yellow 
fire hydrant during retirement ceremonies Thursday at the South Gate 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the five years he and Bill spent together on the streets, LaVigne 
said, "Bill was mellow until he needed to be aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Bill was smart and tough, LaVigne said. 
</P>
<P>
LaVigne remembered the time, about three years ago, when Bill found a car-theft 
suspect after other officers had given up the search. 
</P>
<P>
Bill kept barking and scratching at a garage that police had locked after 
searching it, LaVigne said. 
</P>
<P>
The garage was searched again and the suspect was found hiding in a cabinet, 
LaVigne said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect had somehow sneaked inside after the police made their initial 
search, LaVigne said. 
</P>
<P>
LaVigne also recalled the time, despite a cut paw, when Bill was able to hold 
onto a man trying to flee after beating up a woman. The man had cut Bill's paw 
with a large iron chain. Bill needed stitches to close the wound. 
</P>
<P>
"He was exceptional. He knew when to switch it on and when to switch it off," 
Sgt. Ralph Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
During his retirement party, Bill showed his friendly side by playing with the 
three small LaVigne children. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he demonstrated his aggressiveness when LaVigne commanded him to tackle 
a police officer who was pretending to be a fleeing criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Bill will spend his retirement years with the LaVigne family at their Moreno 
Valley home in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought in Riverside 
</P>
<P>
All of the dogs that serve in the department's K-9 program are bought from the 
Adlerhorst Police Dog Handler's School in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs and their handlers receive training at the kennel, which provides dogs 
for many police departments, according to Pip Reaver. Reaver and her husband, 
David, own and manage the dog school. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs, which are imported from Germany and Holland, are taught to use their 
noses in finding suspects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Russell Beecher, who is in charge of the South Gate police K-9 program, 
said the dogs are also taught only to attack a fleeing suspect or one that is 
threatening the officer or the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council recently budgeted $7,300 to pay for training Officer Ron Inman 
and Waldo, the dog who will replace Bill. 
</P>
<P>
Waldo joins two other dogs in the South Gate K-9 program, Cliff and Boris.

NEW CENTER AT HOSPITAL PROMISES FAST ACTION; CRITICS SAYS IT'S MERELY CLEVER 
MARKETING OF COMMON SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Miller was driving home from work on the San Diego Freeway when he first 
noticed the pain in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
It was a squeezing sensation that pressed sickeningly on the inside of his 
breast, scaring the wits out of the 33-year-old financial consultant. He took 
the next exit and drove to the emergency room of Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center, the nearest hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was met by a nurse who took him into a special room, assessed 
his condition and almost immediately began administering a drug that eventually 
alleviated the pain by easing the flow of blood to his heart. Four days later, 
after 72 hours in intensive care and numerous tests to determine the cause of 
the apparent temporary arterial blockage that had caused the pain, the young 
Long Beach resident was cheerfully preparing to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have had a big heart attack," said Dr. Myrvin Ellestad, medical 
director of the hospital's Heart Institute. "It's very likely now that he won't 
get into serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was treated at the Memorial Chest Pain Center, a new facility at the 
hospital. Depending on who is doing the talking, it is either a program that is 
one of the first of its kind in the country, or a smart marketing technique 
that essentially duplicates the services of other hospitals, but with much more 
hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a specially designated room of the hospital's emergency department, 
the chest pain center consists of four beds equipped with heart monitors. It is 
attended 24 hours a day by a team of specially trained nurses, with a group of 
cardiologists on call. Here, program administrators say, anyone complaining of 
chest pains will be seen within 10 minutes and tentatively diagnosed within 20. 
Treatment will be started, they promise, within 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Early attention is crucial, Ellestad said. More than a million Americans die of 
heart attacks each year, he said. Although many heart attacks are marked by 
chest pains, he said, the average heart attack victim waits three hours after 
the onset of the pain before seeking medical attention. And even when they 
finally make it to an emergency room, he said, patients complaining of chest 
pains are often given low priority compared to trauma patients with more 
visible bleeding wounds, such as those caused by gunshots or automobile 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, immediate treatment was not as critical, doctors say, because about 
all they could do was make their patients comfortable and hope for the best. 
But with the recent development of medications and surgical techniques that, 
when applied early, can dramatically reduce the blockages in arteries that 
cause heart attacks, Ellestad said, time is of the essence. If a heart attack 
has not yet occurred, he said, it can sometimes be prevented. And if the 
patient has already had a heart attack, he said, early treatment can minimize 
the permanent damage to the organ, which would make future attacks less likely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30 Patients a Week 
</P>
<P>
In the three weeks since the center opened, Ellestad said, its nurses and 
physicians have seen an average of 30 patients a week, about 30% of whom had 
actually had heart attacks. By increasing the rapidity of its service to such 
patients, he said, the hospital hopes to reduce its mortality rate for heart 
attack victims from the current 10% to about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sit at home (when you have chest pains) you're going back to 1960 
medicine," said Tammy Florio, a cardiac nurse and vice president of the 
hospital's heart institute. "It's like seeing someone drowning in a pool and 
not helping them." 
</P>
<P>
Getting that message out and delivering on it is costing the hospital money. 
According to Florio, Memorial has budgeted $240,000 the first year for extra 
nurses to staff the chest pain center at 2801 Atlantic Ave. In addition, she 
said, the hospital plans to spend $87,000 on an aggressive publicity campaign 
consisting of 85,000 mailers, 10 public billboards, a series of newspaper ads 
and a speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who use the center, she said, will be charged regular emergency room 
rates in addition to the charges for whatever specialized treatments they 
receive. Eventually, she said, administrators hope the new center will become 
profitable by generating a high patient volume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creative Marketing 
</P>
<P>
Detractors say that is the whole point. Like other area hospitals, Memorial has 
experienced a decline in patient admissions -- 8.7% in the last year. In the 
current atmosphere of increased competition for patients among area hospitals, 
critics say, this one has found a creative new way to market its emergency 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be willing to say that almost anybody could duplicate the time" 
promised by Memorial in diagnosing and treating patients complaining of chest 
pains, said John Senteno, nursing director in the emergency department at 
nearby St. Mary Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
At his own facility, Senteno said, patients are greeted in the waiting room by 
nurses who immediately assess the seriousness of the patients' conditions and, 
in the case of possible heart attack victims, send them without delay into the 
emergency unit for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine any emergency physician in this day and age allowing someone 
complaining of chest pain to sit unattended for any length of time," Senteno 
said. "It would be too risky not to heed that complaint." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's a Priority' 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Community Hospital, according to Annette Kashiwabara, public 
relations coordinator, patients complaining of chest pain are routinely seen in 
10 minutes or less. "As far as assessing chest pain," she said, "that's a 
priority at this hospital, too. It's just that we don't brand it. (What 
Memorial is doing) is a very smart marketing strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motivation for creating it, some patients who have been through 
the new center give it rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Reeves, a 78-year-old retired Methodist minister, began experiencing 
heavy chest pains about 11:30 p.m. Aug. 19 as he lay in bed next to his wife. 
After waiting "a little while to make sure that I wasn't having indigestion," 
Reeves said, he woke up his wife who drove him to Memorial Medical Center, 
where the pain was diagnosed as a heart attack and Reeves was scheduled for 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything would have happened much slower without the center," he said from 
his hospital bed. "The help guaranteed that I was given an extension of life."

BEACH CATS TO SWAP ROCKY LIFE STYLE FOR HIGH DESERT SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CHAWKINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An animal-welfare activist has set the first traps in his campaign to remove 
the cats that for decades have lived in the beachfront rocks along the 
promenade outside Ventura's Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Grillo, who runs a private cat shelter in the high desert near Acton, 
received an endorsement of the move from the state Parks and Recreation 
Department, which controls San Buenaventura State Beach. Grillo said the two 
dozen cats there -- remnants of a colony that at one time numbered about 100 -- 
are sick or dying. 
</P>
<P>
But both he and state officials believe the trapping will face severe 
opposition from several quarters. Animal lovers have long enjoyed watching the 
cats scamper along the rocks, and a small but devoted corps of volunteers has 
fed them daily. Previous attempts to interfere with what has become something 
of a Ventura institution have met with resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had reports of assaults on people trying to work out this problem," said 
Steve Treanor, Ventura district superintendent for the state Parks and 
Recreation Department, adding that an elderly woman once pelted him with cat 
food when she mistakenly thought he was trying to run down a cat on his 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce George, president of the Humane Society of Ventura County, cited "a very 
militant group" that has blocked trapping efforts. "We've had officers whose 
lives were threatened," she said. "There have been so many agencies involved. 
Nobody really wants to get into it with these people." 
</P>
<P>
Grillo said onlookers hurled rocks at him and sabotaged his traps when he tried 
to organize a similar rescue a few years ago. But what he described as the 
cats' deteriorating health makes the move necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation, 
agrees that the cats should go. She said her department, which is under 
contract with the city of Ventura, has not dealt extensively with the cats 
since city officials issued orders in 1981 to steer clear of them. However, she 
said, they constitute a public health menace in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, rabid bats are found at the nearby Ventura County fairgrounds and 
along the Ventura River, and "it's just a matter of time," she said, before the 
cat colony is infected. Many of the cats have upper-respiratory infections, she 
added, and a couple have died painfully after warming themselves on cold nights 
under the hoods of cars in a nearby parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
For such reasons, state parks officials provided Grillo with a letter that he 
had requested, approving the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good to have the cats out there," Treanor said. "Those cats have a 
very low quality of life. They spread diseases among themselves. And when they 
die, they die in the rocks, creating a health hazard. It's an artificially 
created situation, and we try to manage for the most natural conditions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Beachfront 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, cats have been abandoned on the beachfront rocks for as long 
as 25 years. Food and water would be set out for them by well-intentioned cat 
lovers, who inadvertently encouraged others to abandon cats in a place where 
they would receive some care, animal control officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the colony had grown so large that the city planned to trap the cats 
and turn them over to the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was scrapped in the wake of a public outcry. The Humane Society was 
allowed to trap some cats and spay or neuter them and return them to the rocks. 
Society officials say a few had to be killed. The city's policy since has been 
to let the cats alone, except when a health threat is apparent, said Carol 
Green, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Just how apparent it is now might be a subject for debate. 
</P>
<P>
"They ain't sick," said 90-year-old Florence Cardone, a stooped but feisty 
figure in a red hat who has hauled canned food to the cats on a metal cart 
almost every morning since 1976. "They live out their lives here pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Also skeptical is Ralph Weigel, one of the 1980 plan's most vocal opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm highly suspicious," said Weigel, who quit the Humane Society's board of 
directors to protest the 1980 trapping. "There must be so many cats closer to 
them that need attention. Why are they coming up here?" 
</P>
<P>
"The cats are there of their own free will," he added. "They're not tied, 
they're not fenced. They can live very safely in those rocks, as long as they 
have food and water." 
</P>
<P>
Weigel said he believes the cats are healthy. But he said he could support 
Grillo's plan if it is proven to him that the cats are ill. "The time is coming 
when, in spite of anything you do, they're going to get those cats out of 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Borghi, another leader in the fight to keep the cats, said the animals 
are no more sickly than any population of house cats would be. He said a 
veterinarian, whom he would not identify, has checked them out and found only 
minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why this crap comes up every few years," he said. "This guy has 
no business up here. Is he a vivisectionist or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Borghi warned that hundreds of cats would be deliberately abandoned on the 
beach if the trapping persists. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Grillo set out five traps baited with antibiotic-laced cat food but 
failed to catch any cats. He hopes to devise a system using traps and nets and 
to round up half a dozen Ventura volunteers. The volunteers would not only help 
in the trapping of the timid animals, which is expected to last a month, but 
would also monitor the rocks afterward for additional strays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offering an ideal solution," he said. "They will live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kills No Animals 
</P>
<P>
A former actor, Grillo runs three shelters for about 400 dogs and 200 cats 
under the auspices of DELTA (Dedication and Everlasting Love to Animals), a 
nonprofit group he founded in 1979. The animals are all pets that have been 
abandoned and have adapted to living on their own. Those that can't be given to 
families live out their lives in the shelters; Grillo kills no animals and even 
runs what amounts to a hospice for cats with terminal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo said the Ventura cats would occupy a room in a rural ranch house, 
complete with couches, air conditioning, fireplace, potbelly stove, studio and 
cathedral ceilings. The 150 cats in the shelter roam at will from room to room, 
lounging on cat furniture and romping with cat toys in the house and in the 
house's fenced 3,000-square-foot yard. Grillo said he eventually would like to 
build a wing for beach cats and have the sounds of surf piped in to comfort 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo and DELTA, whose $750,000 annual budget is raised strictly through 
private donations, have received high praise from Los Angeles County animal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spoiled Rotten' 
</P>
<P>
"His animals are spoiled rotten," said John Rozier, Castaic district supervisor 
for the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. "They're all 
fat and sassy. Food, water and litter boxes are plentiful. They're all his 
personal loves." 
</P>
<P>
"People ought to be thinking about which is a better life for those cats in 
Ventura," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grillo says much the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what the hell they're doing here if they've allowed the situation 
to degenerate this far," he said. "These so-called animal-lovers have really 
screwed things up." 
</P>
<P>
Cats have gotten sick from canned food, which is not nutritious enough in the 
first place, spoiling in the summer sun, he said. Medicine he has offered the 
feeders has gone unused, and the cats have gone unvaccinated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A beach walk with Grillo is a grim stroll through what he conveys as a feline 
emergency room. He pointed out glazed eyes and mite-infested ears and hematomas 
that he said will blossom into raging infections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flea Anemia' 
</P>
<P>
"See that tabby?," he said. "She's 6 months old, and she'll die from flea 
anemia. She probably has 19% or 20% red blood cells now, and it should be twice 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"See that black one on the end? He's too sick to even eat. He's probably got a 
kidney infection -- you can tell by the way he walks, and look at that rapid 
breathing; that's probably a temperature of 104.

SCHOOL TURNS WAREHOUSE INTO PLACE FOR ART AND MUSIC STUDENTS TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past, music students at Crossroads School sometimes had to practice 
their cellos under the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Although known for its emphasis on the arts and the quality of its arts 
programs, the Santa Monica private school lacked adequate facilities for its 
many courses in drama, music and the visual arts. "We had to deliberately 
retard development of our dance program," Crossroads headmaster Paul Cummins 
said. "We had no place to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But when the high school reopens this fall, students will find an elegant new 
arts center in which to play their violins, practice their dance steps, paint 
their canvases and splice their film. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shell of Warehouse 
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the new building, with principal architect Buzz Yudell, 
Cummins described the 15,000-square-foot facility as an artistic expression in 
its own right. "The building itself is a monument to the arts," he said. He 
noted that Crossroads has already expanded its dance program because of the new 
building, which cost about $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, the arts center doesn't look much different from the rest of 
the campus, a funky jumble of undistinguished buildings on 21st Street, next to 
the Santa Monica Freeway. The center was built in the 50-by-150-foot shell of a 
former warehouse. "This is a warehouse area," the architect said, "and we 
didn't want a pretentious building." From the outside the new building still 
looks like a warehouse, albeit an attractively painted one. "On the outside, we 
wanted it to be tough, but elegant and tough," said Yudell, who designed the 
building with John Ruble. 
</P>
<P>
Inside is another matter. "It looks like a temple," Cummins said. The interior, 
filled with light from high windows and skylights, houses dance and art 
studios, an art gallery, classrooms and practice rooms (some "big enough for a 
quartet, or even a quintet," Cummins noted) on two floors. None of the music 
rooms is a simple square or rectangle, because an asymmetrical space keeps 
sound from focusing, providing superior acoustics. Many of the rooms have 
windows, many with views of the interior, which allow students to look out and 
visitors to see what is happening inside. Yudell said he and his colleagues at 
Moore Ruble Yudell, tried to build a "mysterious" quality into the structure. 
On many of the interior surfaces, for example, "light washes from sources you 
don't see," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the building is an atrium that rises 40 feet to the building's 
gable. What the architect describes as an "interior street" runs from the front 
door on 21st Street to the back door on campus. As Yudell pointed out, the back 
door opens onto an alley where much of the out-of-classroom life of the school 
takes place. The views that students will see when they walk along the 
building's angled interior street -- of stairs, interior windows and doors, 
balconies, the arcade-like art gallery on the second floor -- bring to mind the 
complex back streets of a European town. Yudell said he hopes the atrium area 
will function as a piazza, a place where performances can be put on and people 
will spontaneously congregate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Place 
</P>
<P>
Cummins said he thinks the arts building will become a favorite meeting place 
for students. "I think kids are going to want to hang out here." 
</P>
<P>
All the school's students will have occasion to use the building. Crossroads, 
which enrolls 630 students in grades seven through 12, puts as much emphasis on 
the arts as on academics. All upper-level students are required to take two 
years of course work in the arts. In addition, students who audition 
successfully may major in drama, music or the visual arts, taking 10 to 15 
hours of work a week in these fields in addition to their regular academic 
work. The school's string orchestra program is especially well known, even 
attracting students from abroad. According to Cummins, more than half the 
members of last year's group already have soloed with symphony orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Cummins said the school's dance program has probably benefited the most from 
the new space. The dance faculty will increase from one to four members this 
fall and courses in modern dance and ballet have been added to the curriculum, 
in addition to existing offerings in jazz dance. In terms of facilities, dance 
"has gone from nothing to first cabin," said Cummins, who said he expects the 
program "to take off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honors Student's Memory 
</P>
<P>
The building has been named the Peter Boxenbaum Memorial Arts Education Centre, 
Cummins said. Boxenbaum was a Crossroads student who died last year after a 
long illness a month before he would have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Yudell said the building was his firm's first design for a secondary school, 
although the firm has done several other academic commissions. Cummins praised 
the architects' sensitivity to students' needs. "The building isn't just 
aesthetically gorgeous," he said. "It does what it's supposed to do 
educationally." 
</P>
<P>
Cummins said it took the school four years to raise the money for the building. 
"It's not a gold-plated building," said Yudell, who noted that the building 
cost about $110 per square foot. Concrete and other relatively inexpensive 
materials were used extensively. "We're not using marble and brass," Yudell 
said. "We're trying to get the richness out of the space and light. We're not 
trying to get it out of the richness of the materials." 
</P>
<P>
Cummins says the new building will do what lovely things always do -- enhance 
the quality of the lives that come in contact with it. "It's good for the 
spirit of the whole community to have one building as spectacular as this one 
is," he said.

Final adoption of the county's $2.9-billion budget for fiscal 1989-90 is 
expected at Wednesday's meeting of the County Board of Supervisors. As part of 
the budget, supervisors are expected to end a freeze on hiring and to drop 
limits on travel and buying new equipment. The five-member board also is 
expected to confirm an early decision to build a new 6,000-inmate jail in 
Gypsum Canyon by certifying an environmental impact report on the project. A 
public hearing on the jail issue is scheduled.

An 11-member citizens advisory group will meet at the Trabuco Canyon fire 
station Monday and Wednesday to consider a county proposal to allow 1,700 new 
homes and a new two-lane road to be built in the Foothill-Trabuco area. The 
controversial plan is aimed at regulating growth in a 6,500-acre swatch of 
backcountry northeast of Mission Viejo. The advisory group, made up of local 
residents and property owners, will either endorse or reject the plan before it 
goes to the county Planning Commission and ultimately the Board of Supervisors 
for a vote. The plan has already drawn fire from both environmentalists and 
developers.

11-MONTH-OLD BOY DROWNS IN POOL AT BUENA PARK HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-month-old Buena Park boy who had been playing in the back yard of his 
home wandered through a swimming pool security gate and drowned Saturday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Lorey was discovered by his father about 12:15 p.m. floating face down 
in the family's pool at 8319 Mars Drive and was rushed by paramedics to Humana 
Hospital-West Anaheim, where he was pronounced dead at 1:12 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, Michael Lorey, told authorities that Thomas had been playing 
in the back yard with his sister and wandered away. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if the gate to the pool was locked at the time of 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Lorey pulled the boy from the water and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
which was unsuccessfully continued by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
The family declined to discuss the accident Saturday.

DISTINCT DIFFERENCES 
</P>

<P>
It can be said that those living north and south of Orange County's Mason-Dixon 
Line (the Costa Mesa Freeway) live in different worlds. Besides the more 
obvious differences such as income (southerners are wealthier) and age 
(northerners are a little younger) and in population (there far fewer 
southerners), external factors also help shape an area's identity. After all, 
no place with Disneyland smack in the center of it can be quite like any other 
place on Earth. And where else do the swallows come home to roost? With this in 
mind, here is a potpourri of personality-shaping factors that have helped to 
make North County and South County unique places. 
</P>
<P>
Famous Animal 
</P>
<P>
North: Mickey Mouse, fictional rodent portrayed by short people in costumes at 
that Anaheim amusement park. At age 51, Mickey may be the most recognizable 
character in the world. He still can be found roaming Main Street between 
Fantasyland and Abraham Lincoln's statue. 
</P>
<P>
South: Bubbles the hippopotamus, a real-life plant-eating mammal of the type 
usually found frolicking in the mud of Africa rivers. But in 1978, this two-ton 
escapee from the since-closed Lion Country Safari hid out for three weeks in a 
swamp created by heavy rains near the park. Bubbles died when shot with 
tranquilizers by would-be rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
Higher Education (public) 
</P>
<P>
North: Cal State Fullerton, Fullerton; Coastline Community College, Fountain 
Valley; Cypress College, Cypress; Fullerton College, Fullerton; Golden West 
College, Huntington Beach; Orange Coast College, Costa Mesa; and Rancho 
Santiago College, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
South: UC Irvine, Irvine; Irvine Valley College, Irvine; and Saddleback 
College, Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Budget for Booze 
</P>
<P>
North: Orange County's highest expenditure for packaged liquor was in the North 
County, where Costa Mesans spent $40.33 per capita. 
</P>
<P>

Overlooked Historical Facts 
</P>
<P>
North: The first brickyard in Santa Ana was established in 1875 by James L. 
Garnsey, requiring a large excavation to remove clay deposits for the kilns. 
From this historic hole in the ground sprung a contemporary landmark. The hole 
served perfectly for locating Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
South: Norman St. Claire came to live in Laguna Beach in 1901, becoming the 
first artist to live in that seaside community and unwittingly paving the way 
for innumerable artists to follow, establishing a tradition from which sprang 
the Pageant of the Masters, the Laguna Beach Sawdust Festival and absolutely 
impossible parking situations. 
</P>
<P>
Mysterious Unsolved Crimes 
</P>
<P>
North: Burly Horace J. (Big Mac) McKenna, a former Highway Patrol officer, was 
gunned down gangland-style earlier this year in the early morning as he slept 
in the back of his limousine when his chauffeur pulled into McKenna's secluded 
Carbon Canyon estate. Authorities not only don't know who did it, they can't 
find millions of dollars they think McKenna skimmed from his secret ownership 
of nude and topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
South: In Orange County's most famous trial, Beulah Overell, an 18-year-old 
heiress, and her handsome fiance, Bud Gollum, were acquitted in 1947 of 
bludgeoning to death her parents then blowing up their cabin cruiser Mary E in 
Newport Beach. But whodunit remains a mystery to this day.

PARKS, BEACHES AND MOVIES ALL TAKE A BACK SEAT TO THIS MAGNET: MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tali Kaviani of Irvine goes to South Coast Plaza because her children love 
riding the carrousel and think the McDonald's there is the best in the chain. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Schnaible of Anaheim visits the Orange Mall for art and antique shows. 
</P>
<P>
Peg Gorman of Orange likes hopping a freeway and having her choice of several 
malls from Brea to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's major shopping centers, it seems, are many things to many 
people. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain, according to The Times Orange County Poll: The malls 
are popular. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents gave them resoundingly high marks, with more than 90% 
pleased with the county's shopping and stores -- higher satisfaction levels 
than those given for more traditional leisure pursuits such as movies, parks 
and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the weather, continued buying power and spacious malls, Orange County 
is a shopper's paradise. Enthusiasts come by tour bus to spend. 
</P>
<P>
And the malls' success feeds on itself, experts say. The public's demand lures 
retailers who, in turn, must provide quality products to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't surprising that residents like their malls, said Orange County 
developers and shopping industry observers. In recent years, they say, many 
regional malls have evolved from mere retail outlets into friendly outposts 
where families can spend hours of leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Stack, a retail analyst with the Los Angeles securities firm of Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc., said relatively suburban areas such as Orange 
County often have no focal point. "The mall is the center of town, so shopping 
and socializing take place in the same place," she said. "There is no Main 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, people go to malls to shop, eat, be entertained and meet other 
people, Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baldassare, whose firm conducted the Times Orange County Poll, said the 
survey found that residents prefer the malls to the beaches. That's noteworthy, 
Baldassare said, because Orange County is a place "that prides itself on being 
an outdoor, beach-oriented county." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of money, and we've built great shopping centers for all ages," 
Baldassare said. "When people are bored and have time on their hands, they go 
to South Coast Plaza, Fashion Island or Brea Mall and have the suburban 
experience there," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
Poll response varied slightly from north to south. Sixty-four percent of North 
County residents said they were very satisfied with shopping, compared to 57% 
in the south. In the north, malls and stores ranked No. 1, beating restaurants, 
movies, job opportunities, parks and beaches. South Coast Plaza, the nation's 
leading mall last year with $650 million in sales, was included in North County 
for polling purposes because it is north of the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In the south, however, residents rated parks and beaches above the malls. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County shoppers have a dozen major malls to choose from, but only three 
are in the south: Fashion Island in Newport Beach, Mission Viejo Mall and 
Laguna Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Orange County is recognized as a "hot market," according to Don 
Pendley, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Big regional centers here typify the mall evolution over the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the late '50s and early '60s, the idea was to make malls as stark as 
possible so you could get people in and out as quickly as possible to get more 
turnover in the parking lot," Pendley said. "Now the idea is to get people to 
spend as much time as possible. That has fueled the presence of entertainment 
and recreation functions to make it more than just a retail facility -- to make 
it a life-style facility, if such things exist. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come right down to it, and we don't have specific answers, my 
inevitable question is where, other than homes and places of work and schools, 
do people spend more time than in a shopping center? Nobody comes up with a 
decent answer." 
</P>
<P>
Pendley said his organization's national surveys have shown that 94% of adults 
go to a shopping center at least once a month and that the average person 
visits a mall about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henwood, general manager at South Coast Plaza, said county malls thrive 
partly because the economy and population base have grown. South Coast is 
planning a 12-store expansion for this fall, he added. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that people come to malls for many reasons, Henwood said South 
Coast's strength lies in its stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Shopping is a great pastime. People enjoy looking nice, and they like to go to 
nice stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are in Orange County because they enjoy a special place to live 
and have taste levels that go with this unique area. That extends to clothing. 
We think the customer is a very intelligent shopper. They know what they want. 
We're not trying to create an environment that moves us too far from what we 
are, which is a retail center." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Daley, a shopping center developer with the Costa Mesa firm of 
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, said economic stability and steady buying power are 
strong reasons for Orange County's appeal as a shoppers' haven. 
</P>
<P>
While some major malls, like Westminster Plaza and South Coast Plaza, are in 
the midst of expansion, new malls are an iffy proposition, Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting pretty close to the saturation point, if we're not already 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Stack agreed. "Malls are very popular, but you're going to see fewer built 
nationwide, because we've hit the saturation point in the country. California 
is one of the few places that holds out the possibility for further major mall 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Kaviani, a mother of two, said she hits the malls maybe once a week, "but not 
always for shopping." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said, she looks for malls that have a wide range of features for 
children. "We don't go as much to malls that don't have them, that have just 
straight shopping, because the kids get bored real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Guinther, a Costa Mesa real estate investor who was polled, believes the 
county is a trend setter: "You look around and you see lime-green or 
phosphorescent shorts, you've got to say we're starting something new. It's a 
really competitive area, so you can walk into Saks or Nordstrom's or any of 
those places and really have a pretty good selection."

<TEXT>
<P>
1776 Mission San Juan Capistrano is established by Father Junipero Serra. 
</P>
<P>
1835 Richard Henry Dana Jr. sails into the port of what is today Dana Point. He 
refers to it as "the only romantic spot in California" in his book "Two Years 
Before the Mast." 
</P>
<P>
1864 James Irvine and several partners purchase the Ranchos Lomas de Santiago 
and San Joaquin, as well as a portion of the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, and 
form the Irvine Ranch. Irvine will become sole owner of the property two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
1894 James Irvine incorporates his 108,000-acre ranch property as the Irvine 
Co., and the land begins a transformation from grazing to farming. 
</P>
<P>
1906 The Balboa Pavilion opens. 
</P>
<P>
1926 Coast Highway reaches Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
1929 San Clemente is founded by Ole Hanson, who wants to build a "Spanish 
Village by the Sea." 
</P>
<P>
1932 Laguna Beach holds its first Festival of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
1936 Newport Harbor is dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
1943 The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station opens on 4,000 acres of Irvine Ranch 
land. 
</P>
<P>
1960 With the completion of a 5.8-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between San Juan 
Capistrano and San Clemente, the southern tip of Orange County is linked to the 
north by modern highway. The stretch will become the major travel artery 
between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
1963 The Mission Viejo Co. buys 10,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo from the 
O'Neill family for residential, recreational and retail development. 
</P>
<P>
1964 The UC Irvine campus is dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills Leisure World opens. 
</P>
<P>
1965 Houses go on sale in University Park in Irvine, the first master-planned 
community in the county and the first of many in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
1971 Dana Point Harbor is dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
1988 The Orange County Board of Supervisors approves the Irvine Coast plan 
after more than two decades of wrangling. The plan for the 2.5-mile stretch of 
county land along Coast Highway between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach will 
leave 76% of the site's nearly 10,000 acres untouched.

THE CONCRETE DIVIDING LINE: IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it is indeed Orange County's Mason-Dixon line, the Costa Mesa Freeway is 
largely unimpressive. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it is lined primarily by industrial developments and 
concrete-block walls because the constant traffic and emissions -- not to 
mention the noise from grinding gears and rubber on asphalt -- do not make it 
an attractive neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, it can be a confusing line to separate the diagonally contoured 
county into north and south. 
</P>
<P>
The boundary gets off to a pretty start as Newport Boulevard in Newport Beach, 
beginning at 30th Street and passing by trendy restaurants, surf shops, 
boutiques, the rear of expensive homes, City Hall and even a fast-food joint or 
two as it heads north. 
</P>
<P>
And then comes its most picturesque moment. Look quickly, or you might miss the 
postcard-like scene as Newport Boulevard passes over a bridge crossing Lido 
Channel. It offers a glimpse of graceful boats bobbing in their docks while 
other vessels, from canoes to powerboats, slice lazily through the blue water 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The picturesque scene quickly fades into memory as Newport Boulevard passes 
into Costa Mesa, past newly prettified shops in the redevelopment area. And 
then it abruptly offers a less-than-scenic view -- "the pit," as some call the 
massive hole of raw dirt in the middle of the divided boulevard that will 
become an extension of the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway actually begins a few more stoplights after that. Industrial and 
office buildings whiz past as the thoroughfare touches on the edges of Irvine 
and Tustin on the right and Santa Ana on the left. 
</P>
<P>
As it nears and then passes through Orange, the freeway is lined on both sides 
with concrete-block walls and eucalyptus trees shielding the back of apartment 
complexes and houses. A few stores and restaurants appear before the freeway -- 
for virtually the first time -- abandons its straight-arrow course and ends 
with a curve that dumps the lanes into the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim.

FORD AGENCY HAS NEW NAME BUT FRAUD INQUIRY GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name has been changed from Wilson Ford to Friendly Ford and pitchman Ralph 
Williams has been replaced by a man named Tony in the television ads. 
</P>
<P>
But Friendly Ford in Huntington Beach is the same business that was raided in 
March by the state Department of Motor Vehicles and other law enforcement 
agencies as part of an investigation into its sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wilson still is president and principal shareholder of the dealership, 
Williams is still general manager, and senior DMV investigator Claire Paige 
says her agency is still in the midst of a complicated investigation into 
allegations of sales fraud by the dealership that date back to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
DMV investigators won't discuss what they have found in their investigation so 
far, but do say they continue receiving complaints about inflated prices from 
current Friendly customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony in Texas 
</P>
<P>
And in Texas, testimony in a disciplinary hearing against a dealer there 
alleges that Wilson Ford at one time taught sales personnel how to use a 
computer program to falsify interest rates and reap inflated profits. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson could not be reached for comment Friday, and Friendly Ford's deputy 
general manager, Gerry Schroff, declined comment on the investigation. Schroff 
said only that the DMV investigation had nothing to do with the dealership's 
name change or Williams' disappearance from the television ads. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall G. Mintz, the Century City attorney representing Friendly Ford, 
said the dealership decided to change its name and ads in part to remove the 
onus of bad publicity caused by the DMV raid and allegations against Wilson 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, in a telephone interview from his home in Dallas, said he stopped 
doing the television ads "because I don't need (the exposure) and I am tired of 
being a target while running the most honest and legitimate dealership, in my 
opinion, in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of DMV 
</P>
<P>
Williams lashed out at the DMV and complained that some of the law enforcement 
officers who conducted the March 12 raid had entered the dealership with guns 
drawn. He compared their conduct to "what happened in Nazi Germany. This is not 
America, that this can happen."

He said the DMV has not filed any charges in the case nearly six months after 
the raid because "they haven't got anything." 
</P>
<P>
In a 100-page affidavit filed in Orange County Superior Court to support the 
DMV's request for a warrant to search Wilson Ford and seize various documents 
and computer programs, the agency's investigators contended that Wilson Ford 
trained its sales personnel to deceive customers and inflate the purchase price 
of autos. The dealership was also accused of conspiring to defraud consumers 
through misleading television ads, featuring Williams, that promised cars at 
rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
A fixture of late-night television in Southern California for decades, Williams 
started as pitchman for his own dealership in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
As a car dealer, however, Williams ran afoul of the DMV -- which regulates 
California auto retailers -- on several occasions. He had his dealer's license 
revoked on two separate occasions. 
</P>
<P>
After joining Wilson Ford he was refused a salesman's license in 1983 on the 
grounds that he had made sales at the Beach Boulevard car lot without being 
licensed. That action was later overturned and Williams now has a valid car 
salesman's license in California. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also ran afoul of regulators in the state of Washington, where he once 
owned a dealership. He still owes consumers in that state millions of dollars 
awarded in a 1972 consumer fraud judgment against him and his company, 
Washington authorities said Friday. The charges against Williams, according to 
Washington Assistant Atty. Gen. Jay Uchida, included false and misleading 
advertising in television ads in which Williams was the star. 
</P>
<P>
While Williams lives in Dallas and once owned a dealership in Texas, an 
official of the Texas Motor Vehicle Commission said Friday that Williams is not 
now active in the auto business in that state. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Williams and Wilson Ford figured prominently in a recent administrative 
hearing into alleged misconduct by a Tyler, Tex., car dealership whose former 
owner also was a major investor in Wilson Ford until June. 
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, according to Henri ten Brink, assistant director of 
enforcement for the state Motor Vehicle Commission, the commission alleged that 
the dealership "engaged in various activities involving misleading sales 
techniques" and inflated pricing. 
</P>
<P>
One employee of the dealership, ten Brink said, "testified that they had one 
particular computer program, called 'Back to the Future,' that he learned to 
use when he was taken to California to the Wilson Ford lot. He testified that 
he was introduced to a Mr. Williams, who introduced him to someone else who 
showed him how the program was being done" at Wilson Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Brink said the program involved citing a highly inflated finance charge by 
programming a computer to start compiling interest as much as a year earlier 
than the actual effective date of the loan. The price would be adjusted so that 
the monthly payments were agreeable to the customer, but the amount included 
for finance charges would be hundreds, even thousands of dollars higher than 
would really be paid to the bank. The dealer would be able to pocket that extra 
money and would hide it in the final paper work by disguising it as fees for 
dealer protection plans and other add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz, the Wilson/Friendly Ford attorney, said Friday that he was aware of the 
Texas testimony but has been told by Friendly officials that the computer 
program the agency uses is not the one described.
