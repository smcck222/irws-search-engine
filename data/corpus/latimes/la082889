Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's UNITA rebels, met with South African 
President Frederik W. de Klerk to discuss a faltering peace accord with the 
Luanda government. In a rare public appearance after the meeting, Savimbi told 
a news conference in Pretoria: "I hope peace will get back on the rails." But 
Savimbi, who has fought Angola's Marxist government for 14 years, sharply 
attacked Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, accusing him of deliberately 
misrepresenting a peace pact signed in Gbadolite, Zaire. Each side in the 
Angolan conflict has accused the other of violating the cease-fire agreed upon 
in the June 22 accord.

The jury in the federal tax evasion trial of hotel queen Leona Helmsley 
deliberated for a second day without reaching a verdict. Two hours into 
deliberations, they sent out a note requesting documents relating to a 
Helmsley-controlled partnership that owned three of the Helmsley hotels in 
Manhattan. The partnership, Realesco Equities Corp., is named in two sets of 
charges -- aiding in the filing of false corporate tax returns and mail fraud 
-- against Helmsley and her two co-defendants, ex-aides Frank Turco and Joseph 
Licari. The jury also asked for a June, 1985, memo that Turco had forwarded to 
Licari and on which he had written: "Please deep six after reading." The 
document was a progress report on renovations at Helmsley's Connecticut estate. 
Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading $1.2 million in federal taxes by charging 
personal expenses to her businesses.

RANCHO SECO'S SALE WEIGHED

<TEXT>

Directors of Sacramento's citizen-owned utility district voted to slow the 
dismantling of the Rancho Seco nuclear power facility while they study offers 
by private investors to operate it. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
board closed the plant June 7, one day after voters ordered the utility to 
cease operating the 15-year-old facility. Since then, the five-member board has 
divided 3-2 over whether the vote mandated that Rancho Seco should be closed 
for good or whether the district has the legal right to sell it to a private 
company, which would reopen it. Opened in 1974, Rancho Seco was plagued with 
numerous shutdowns, and electricity bills of Sacramento residents almost 
doubled before the referendum June 6 in which 53% of the voters endorsed the 
closing.

POPE INVITED TO VISIT BEIRUT

The spiritual leader of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah group invited Pope John 
Paul II to visit war-ravaged Beirut and guaranteed his security in the city's 
Muslim western sector. The invitation by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, made 
in an interview with the Rome daily La Repubblica, came amid growing 
speculation in Italy that the pontiff could make a visit next month. The 
Vatican has confirmed it is trying to arrange a papal trip to Lebanon. An 
editorial in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said John Paul wants to 
go to Lebanon as a pilgrim to a martyred land. Fadlallah has criticized the 
Pope for championing the Christians in Beirut while accusing the Muslims of 
trying to destroy Christian areas of the city.

Police in Taiwan deported an American and a Canadian, both Taiwanese-born 
dissidents advocating the island's independence from China, after the two 
allegedly entered the country illegally. About 300 police surrounded Robert 
Tsai, of Houston, and Leo Yi Shih, of Toronto, as they were driving to speak at 
a seminar in Taipei organized by a private law foundation. Club-wielding police 
used tear gas to disperse their supporters and pulled Tsai and Leo out of their 
car. The two were taken directly to the airport and put aboard a departing 
flight. Taiwan has barred Tsai and Leo from returning, saying they advocated 
that Taiwan no longer claim to be part of China.

A fight involving inmates from the East and West coasts at Lompoc Federal 
Penitentiary apparently was triggered by two feuding prisoners who organized 
the groups against each other, officials said. The prison yard fight Friday 
night involved about 40 to 50 inmates and lasted less than a half hour before 
it was broken up by guards, said Paul Ortiz, executive assistant to the warden. 
A "lock-down," in which each inmate is confined to his cell, remained in 
effect. "What we have found so far is that one inmate from the East and one 
from the West couldn't settle their own differences and it escalated," Ortiz 
said. One inmate was stabbed in the abdomen and suffered a broken skull in the 
fight and another suffered a broken jaw.

ACTING TEACHER ROSE SCHULMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rose Schulman, a veteran of more than half a century as actress, director and 
teacher with the nation's oldest repertory theater, the Hedgerow Theater of 
Rose Valley, Pa., has died at the age of 79. 
</P>
<P>
She died after a heart attack July 30 in Hedgerow House, the theater's official 
residence, associates in Los Angeles said last week. Miss Schulman had 
continued to teach acting classes at the repertory company, founded in 1923 by 
Jasper Deeter, until shortly before her death. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, her students included Richard Basehart, Anne Baxter, Keir 
Dullea and Margo Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
Although she once described her three loves as "horses, poker and men," her 
greatest passion was the theater. She was a tough and demanding teacher. The 
goal, she repeatedly told her students, was to combine "the freedom of the bird 
and the precision of the watchmaker." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schulman is survived by a brother, Albert Schulman of Philadelphia, and 
sister, Dorothy Bordock of Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be conducted at noon Sept. 3 at Hedgerow Theater, and 
her ashes will be scattered in the theater garden.

MARY L. WALLACE; CALLED 1ST WOMAN TO SING ON RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Lewis Wallace, who in 1921 became the first female vocalist to sing over 
"wireless telephone" or radio, has died at the Casitas Care Center in Granada 
Hills. She was 92. 
</P>
<P>
She died last Monday from problems related to old age, said her daughter, 
Louisa Wallace Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Known professionally as Little Mary White and Mary Lewis, the lyric soprano was 
born in Bethany, Mo., Dec. 1, 1896. She began her singing career in the Midwest 
and toured the United States, becoming a headliner on the Sid Grauman theater 
circuit and in radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
She abandoned her career after marrying film director Richard Wallace, a 
founder of the Screen Directors Guild. After his death in 1951, she became an 
artists' booking agent in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Wallace is survived by her daughter and two grandsons. Jacobs asked that 
memorial contributions be made to the 28th Church of Christ, Scientist, 
Westwood Village.

The civilization of the ancient city of Carthage will be explored in "Carthage: 
A Mosaic of Ancient Tunisia," opening Sept. 9 at the Natural History Museum of 
Los Angeles County in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
Carthage came to glory under the Phoenicians, was destroyed and rebuilt by the 
Romans and transformed by the Christians. Its location on the North African 
coast made it an important trade and cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
Using more than 300 artifacts, including intricate mosaics and Etruscan 
bronzes, the exhibit illustrates the life of the city from 800 BC to AD 700. 
</P>
<P>
Many other events are planned to coincide with the exhibit, which runs through 
Jan. 7, 1990. A children's class on the animals of North Africa will be held at 
the museum on Sept. 9 from 1:30 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the only West Coast showing of the exhibit. Many of the items have 
never before been displayed in public. Call (213) 744-3466 for exhibit 
information, 744-3342 for class information.

Let us all be thankful that Stein is "Sealed Up, Walled In, (and) Locked Out." 
His ignorant and racist attitudes reveal a man who has purposely detached 
himself from the community, perhaps consumed by his own materialistic quest. I 
doubt he would regard white-collar crime as a form of "barbaric" behavior 
because it doesn't affect his Mercedes, CD, or his closed house. His closed 
environment echoes his provincial mind. In all likelihood, the only step he has 
taken to help his community is to join the empty Reagan legacy of "Just say 
no."

Poor Ben Stein, imprisoned by modern urban hostilities. Lawyer, writer, and 
economist; rich, successful, and probably envied, yet he can't find a safe and 
pleasant haven in this heedless and heartless world. The "new barbarians" are 
at his gate, and the "new Dark Ages" have begun. 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- are things really that terrible, all the time, for everyone? Take 
his examples. I can manage plastic wrap on medicine bottles without serious 
difficulty and with some feeling of security. It's not such a bad idea. My 
American sports car has a simple and workable alarm system. It doesn't go off 
by mistake, and I still have my radio and tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
My house in a modest middle-class neighborhood isn't sealed -- no burglar 
alarm, open windows -- yet nobody has broken in since we moved here 13 years 
ago. Maybe we don't own enough for anyone to want it, or maybe it's just too 
much trouble to cart things down our front steps. Sometimes someone nearby 
plays a loud radio, or a dog barks at midnight, and they're building a house 
down the hillside, but mostly it's peaceful. Yes, there's smog, but the dust 
here is kinder and gentler then the sticky black East Coast variety. 
</P>
<P>
Go away and hide, Ben. Wall yourself in. You're right -- it's a dangerous 
world, and trouble is everywhere, even in L.A. Some people have no homes. Some 
people are poor and sick. Some people -- "new barbarians," perhaps -- are 
desperate, or drugged, or crazed, or evil, or criminal, or some combination of 
those things. Our society isn't doing much to solve any of their problems or 
the problems they make for the rest of us. I don't deny it. Sometimes, though 
not often enough, I even try to do something about it. But right now I'm going 
to sit here on my patio and enjoy the summer afternoon.

PETE WILSON

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article about Sen. Pete Wilson buttressing his environmental image (Part I, 
Aug. 10) was typical political doublespeak and evasion. Wilson brags about his 
support of a Condor Range and Rivers proposal in the Sespe Mountains, but he 
omits the fact that the proposal is inadequate. If the condors are ever to be 
reintroduced to the wild, there must be sufficient wildlands out there for them 
to soar over. The Forest Service proposal provides too little, and Wilson is 
proud of his support of this absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important is his complete silence on the most important conservation 
issue in California: protection of desert areas. Wilson has blocked every 
attempt to create wilderness, national parklands, or any other viable 
protection of our besieged desert lands. Yet he continues to lay claim to being 
an environmentalist -- just like George Bush, our "staunchly environmental" 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Keep trying to fool us, Sen. Wilson. You've succeeded to up to now.

ALOMAR PICKS UP PADRES WITH BAT IN SWEEP OF METS

There are times in your life when, for whatever reason, something so good 
happens that you're not quite sure how to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
All that's left to do is scratch your head and mumble, "I don't know. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was one of those times for Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
He had a career-high five runs batted in as the Padres outlasted the New York 
Mets, 13-7, in front of 24,139 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to complete 
their first series sweep against the Mets since May 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grant pitched 3 2/3 innings to earn his first save as a Padre. The winner, 
Pat Clements (2-1), worked 3 1/3 innings, his longest outing since June 27. 
Mark Parent had two hits and four RBIs and Tony Gwynn, Bip Roberts and Jack 
Clark each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar did make an error -- his 25th of the season -- in the first inning, and 
it led to two runs. But he went three for six, including a two-run homer when 
he was attempting a hit-and-run. He finished the three-game series seven for 
14, with two doubles and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I'm swinging the bat pretty good. I was just trying 
to stay back and keep my body in, but on the home run, I saw the curve and just 
reacted." 
</P>
<P>
The homer came hitting right-handed, where Alomar has been having his troubles. 
He is hitting .220 right-handed and .309 left-handed this season. But three of 
his four homers are right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working hard and seeing (videotape) at home," Alomar said. "My power 
side is my right-hand side, but I've been struggling from that side. But I 
can't say I'm struggling. I have to go up there and say I'm going to beat this 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
From the right side Sunday, he doubled home Bip Roberts in the third and 
homered in the sixth, which also scored Roberts. From the left side, he singled 
home Roberts and catcher Mark Parent in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
All that came after the error, which put the Padres behind early, and it came 
at a time when starter Don Schulze was getting hit hard. Schulze lasted just 1 
1/3 innings, allowing four runs and six hits. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the first and runners on first and third, Darryl Strawberry hit 
what could have been a double-play grounder to Alomar's right, but the ball 
bounced out of Alomar's glove. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was in my glove, but when I went to throw it to Tempy (shortstop 
Garry Templeton), it was behind me," Alomar said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just a bad year for me defensively," said Alomar, who made only 16 
errors last season. "I know I'm having a tough time defensively, but this game 
is not only defense -- it's offense, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know. Maybe I'm having a bad year defensively this year and I'll 
have a good year next year. I just try to do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
For two innings Sunday, it looked as if it wouldn't be enough. The Mets took 
the lead, 4-0, before the Padres scored two runs in the second, two in the 
third, four in the fifth, two in the sixth and three more in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Great comeback," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "You've got to give the guys 
credit. Man, they could have folded their tents. We were down against a good 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ojeda started for the Mets, but left in the fourth with sprained ligaments 
in his left knee and a lousy statistical line: four runs and five hits allowed. 
He was examined after the game and is expected to miss a couple of starts. 
</P>
<P>
John Mitchell, Jeff Musselman, Jeff Innis, Don Aase and Randy Myers followed 
Ojeda, and Met pitchers combined to issue 10 walks -- the most allowed by a Met 
staff since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk 10 people, you should get slaughtered," Manager Davey Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Padres could have had more, leaving 10 men on base. Roberts had two 
hits and scored three runs, and Gwynn extended his hitting streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco lost to Montreal Sunday, so the third-place Padres (66-64), with 
their four-game winning streak, moved to eight games back and are two games 
over .500 for the first time since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a lot to (sweep), regardless of whether it's the Mets, Pirates or 
Braves," said Gwynn, who improved his league-leading average to .345. "I think 
we just wanted this series more than they did. When we needed a hit, we got it. 
When we needed a pitch, we got that, too." 
</P>
<P>
It seems odd that the Padres would be hungrier than the Mets, who were 2 1/2 
games behind first-place Chicago in the NL East Sunday morning. But at least 
one Met agreed with Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going out there like we're waiting to get beat," center fielder Juan 
Samuel said. "If we're going to make a move, we have to turn it on." 
</P>
<P>
It was Samuel who lost Parent's bases-loaded fly ball to shallow center in the 
sun during the Padres' four-run fifth inning. The ball dropped, and all three 
runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually hate day games," Parent said. "It's hot, bright, and you have to get 
out of bed and get going. But today, I love them." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
When the Padres last swept the Mets, the winning pitchers were Juan 
Eichelberger, Chris Welsh and Gary Lucas. . . . Don Schulze's 1 1/3 innings 
Sunday was the shortest outing by a Padre starter all season. . . . Mark 
Grant's save was the third of his career. His last save was April 10, 1987, 
when he was pitching for the Giants against the Dodgers. . . . Sunday's victory 
was the Padres' 35th come-from-behind victory this season. Last year, the 
Padres came from behind to win 34 times.

ANOTHER INCREDIBLE FINISH GIVES LEMOND TITLE

<P>
Just as he did in the recent Tour de France, Greg LeMond made a late burst and 
won the professional title in the weather-plagued World Cycling Championships 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who said he was ready to quit the race, decided to continue and went on 
to win his second world cycling title with a charge over the final 300 meters 
as rain pelted the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt terrible all the way until two laps to go," LeMond said. "I was ready 
to quit, but I figured a lot of things can happen in the last two laps." 
</P>
<P>
His victory added another chapter to a remarkable year as he returned from 
injuries and a shooting accident after his first Tour de France title in 1986. 
In this year's Tour de France, he trailed Laurent Fignon of France by 50 
seconds going into the final 15-kilometer sprint and won by eight seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a great year. I never would have believed it," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond's sprint Sunday enabled him to edge the Soviet Union's Dmitri Konychev 
and Ireland's Sean Kelly by less than a second after he caught the leaders at 
the top of the hill in the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do it on the descent, but I did it too early," LeMond said. "I 
caught them and I felt I could control the race until the finish." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond and the others went down the long downhill slope together, waiting for 
the last possible second to launch the final dash. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to be leading off the sprint or take it just coming around the 
corner since it was just a short straight," LeMond said. "I felt very good and 
just let it all out until the finish." 
</P>
<P>
He and others closed the lead that was once nearly five minutes on the 21 laps 
over the 7.67-mile circuit. LeMond's time was 6 hours 45 minutes 59 seconds for 
161.07 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The race started in dry weather. A group of nine broke away after eight laps. 
By 11 laps, the margin was 4:50 over the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Then the rain struck. Thomas Wegmueller of Switzerland, Konychev, Thierry 
Claveyrolat of France and Maarten Ducrot of the Netherlands broke away in the 
14th lap as the leaders began stretching out. 
</P>
<P>
Konychev and Claveyrolat held on until two laps were left, when Holland's 
Steven Rooks caught them as the pack gradually narrowed the margin. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the last lap 11 seconds behind, LeMond was part of a group that 
included Fignon. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon made his move first up the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"Fignon attacked but I waited," LeMond said. "I didn't want to go too long. And 
then he died out there." 
</P>
<P>
Fignon said he was surprised to see LeMond catch him on the final climb. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I tried to get away, Greg was there," he said. "He was too strong." 
</P>
<P>
Said LeMond: "I didn't run against Fignon, I ran to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
On the decline, LeMond, Fignon, Konychev, Claveyrolat and Rooks were suddenly 
joined by Kelly. All the leaders were waiting for the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the final turn, on the final long straight, LeMond made his move and 
held a slight advantage the rest of the way, waving an arm just before the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Konychev darted ahead of Kelly, who was looking over the wrong shoulder to 
check Rooks' position. The Dutchman finished fourth, with Claveyrolat fifth, 
edging Fignon. 
</P>
<P>
"When I couldn't break clear before the final straightaway, I had no chance 
because others are better sprinters," Fignon said. "Being first is the only 
thing that counts. Second or third in the world championship doesn't mean 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond previously won the world title in 1983. He was second in 1982 and 1985. 
He also won the world junior championship in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He joins four others who have won the Tour de France and the world professional 
title the same year. The others were Belgium's Eddy Merckx, Ireland's Stephen 
Roche, and Frenchmen Louison Bobet and Bernard Hinault.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE NEVER GOT TIRED OF GIVING ANYONE HIS SEVEN CENTS WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Luciano, author and entertainer, made his living as an umpire until one day 
some simple arithmetic convinced him he was in the wrong business. 
</P>
<P>
"Umpires are supposed to keep their place," he said. "If a player was making 
$20,000 a year, I would have minded my own business. But I figured out that Jim 
Rice was making $582 for every strike I called and I was making seven cents. 
Seven cents. There's no way I'm going to keep my place for seven cents." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: From Terry Boers of the Chicago Sun-Times, suggesting that Chicago Cub 
announcer Harry Caray call it a career after being inducted into the Hall of 
Fame: "Why? Because he has turned just about every Cub game into a comedy of 
bloopers that's lowlighted by repeated mispronunciations of visiting players' 
names, misidentification of Cub players (How many times early this season did 
he refer to Andre Dawson as Andre Rodgers?) and his incessant slobbering over 
the Cubs." 
</P>
<P>
Add Caray: His son, Skip, is the announcer for the Atlanta Braves and grandson 
Chip will do the play-by-play for the Orlando Magic of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think of it," Harry said. "Three generations of Carays broadcasting major 
league sports at the same time. It seems a mathematical impossibility. I must 
have been married when I was 5 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When Raider wide receiver Sam Graddy finished second to Carl Lewis 
in the 1984 Olympic 100 meters, who did he beat out for the silver medal? 
(Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Post-mortem: The subject was the 1986 American League playoffs, when the Angels 
came within one strike of beating the Boston Red Sox, and Hall of Fame umpire 
Al Barlick told the Philadelphia Inquirer: "I felt so sorry for Gene Mauch. 
Think of it, one pitch. One pitch. It wasn't supposed to be, was it? 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of respect for Gene. He'd come out to question you, and if you had 
an answer for him, he'd leave you alone. If you didn't, he'd eat you alive." 
</P>
<P>
Kinerism of the week: How bad are the Montreal Expos in base-stealing? New York 
Met broadcaster Ralph Kiner put it this way: "They have been thrown out only 
one less time than the last place team has been thrown out the most." 
</P>
<P>
Still the king: Royce Nielsen, regular caddy for Arnold Palmer, told the 
Seattle Times: "He's quite a guy. After the PGA, he stood out on the parking 
lot signing autographs for 35 people. Nick Faldo, who might be playing better 
than anyone in the world, walked by unnoticed. A little girl asked Curtis 
Strange for an autograph and he said no." 
</P>
<P>
Add autographs: Karolyn Rose, sitting with an Atlanta Journal reporter as they 
watched her son, Pete Jr., play for the Erie (Pa.) Orioles, said: "I know 
people change. I just hope Little Pete never does. Watch the way he signs 
autographs for the kids. He really cares. I hope he never charges somebody 15 
bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ben Johnson of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Whitey Herzog, manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, who have hit 59 
home runs: "We'll catch Maris, sure as hell."

RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
STYLISH STAR UPHOLDS ONE-FILLY, ONE-STAKE RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California turf fillies have been a bewildering bunch this season, with a 
new star emerging every time a stake has been run. 
</P>
<P>
Things were no different Sunday at Del Mar, when it was Stylish Star's turn in 
the spotlight after her 2 3/4-length upset in the $165,000 Del Mar Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, riding Stylish Star for the first time for trainer Dan 
Hendricks, kept the daughter of Our Native slightly off the pace of Tapping 
Tudor to the final turn, then accelerated clear and won without facing a 
serious challenge. It was that simple. 
</P>
<P>
"She was going comfortably all the way," said McCarron. "It certainly was a 
good feeling when she responded at the head of the lane." 
</P>
<P>
The favored entry of Darby's Daughter and General Charge finished second and 
third, respectively, in the field of nine 3-year-old fillies, while Claiborne 
Farm's Kelly put in her usual late run to be an unthreatening fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star was bred and is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Tom Cavanagh of Beverly 
Hills, who always appreciate a clear-cut victory. In 1981 their handicap horse 
Caterman won the Hollywood Gold Cup but was disqualified for interference. 
Caterman won the Cabrillo Handicap at Del Mar the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, one of two local trainers used by the Cavanaghs, is a native of 
nearby Rancho Santa Fe and former assistant to trainer Richard Mandella. The 
Oaks was his second Del Mar stakes victory and the first $100,000-plus triumph 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Really got to thinking this could be a nice filly at Hollywood Park in her 
third grass race there," said Hendricks, referring to a narrow defeat on July 
10. "At that point I thought she might peak down here and have a shot in this 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks bypassed the Aug. 13 San Clemente Handicap to run Stylish Star in an 
allowance race four days later. Darby's Daughter was an impressive winner of 
the San Clemente, while Stylish Star quietly defeated Noble and Nice, a maiden, 
in the lesser event. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's crowd of 46,818 -- 22,415 on-track and 24,403 off-track -- keyed their 
betting to the San Clemente, making the Frankel entry favored at 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
But the fans should have looked around for a filly who had not won a stake this 
season; six horses have now won major races in the division. 
</P>
<P>
A key race turned out to be the restricted Typecast Stakes on Hollywood Park's 
closing day, July 24, in which Stylish Star finished second to A Thrilling 
Moment. 
</P>
<P>
A Thrilling Moment won Saturday's San Jose Handicap at Bay Meadows, a result 
that encouraged Hendricks even further. McCarron took it from there. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan just told me that she would be close to the pace," said McCarron, who also 
won a $38,000 supporting feature Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in front early, but nobody was making me go faster than we wanted, 
which was nice." 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star now has three victories in 11 starts, dating to her debut at Del 
Mar last September. She covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star returned $33.80, $7.40 and $6. The entry returned $2.40 to place 
and $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park officials have proposed running their $1 million Hollywood 
Futurity on Christmas Eve. Reaction from owners and trainers has been tepid. . 
. . Charlie Whittingham will be on the cargo flight from Ontario National early 
Monday morning when he ships three horses to Chicago: Frankly Perfect and Nasr 
el Arab for the Sept. 3 Arlington Million and Claire Marine for the $500,000 
Beverly D. Stakes on Sept. 2. Also on board will be Million starters Pleasant 
Variety and Pay the Butler; Del Mar Derby winner Hawkster, who is going in the 
Sept. 4 Secretariat Stakes; and Swaps Stakes winner Prized, whose ultimate 
destination is Woodbine in Ontario, Canada for the $1 million Molson Challenge, 
Sept. 10. . . . Ron McAnally has decided to run Bayakoa, the country's top 
older mare, in the $150,000 Chula Vista Handicap next Saturday at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's seven-furlong Pat O'Brien Handicap has drawn On the Line, winner of 
the July 30 Bing Crosby Handicap; Sam Who, the troubled favorite in Crosby; and 
Oraibi, impressive sprint winner earlier in the meet. . . . With a daily 
average of $7.2 million, the Del Mar on and off-track handle is up 10% over 
last year's figures. Add a broken left ankle to the broken collarbone suffered 
by apprentice Tony Guymon in Saturday's second race. . . . Katoon and Premiere 
raced to the first win dead-heat of the meeting in Sunday's first race. 
Third-place Gypsy's Prophet came within a nose of making it Del Mar's first 
triple dead-heat. . . . Sunday's total Del Mar handle included $523,031 bet on 
the Longacres Mile in Seattle, won by Simply Majestic for the second straight 
year.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
FROST ADDS TO CRENSHAW'S ICY PLAYOFF RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't just the victory, it was the competition David Frost enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Frost scrambled for a par, making a three-foot putt on the second playoff hole 
Sunday to beat Ben Crenshaw and win the World Series of Golf at Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"The most thrilling thing is to beat Crenshaw, (Payne) Stewart and (Greg) 
Norman," Frost said of the shootout down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Norman barely missed joining Frost and Crenshaw in the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw made the playoff by one-putting the last four holes in regulation. But 
the results were the same for the Texan once he got there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm beginning to have a real, particular aversion to playoffs," Crenshaw said 
after his bogey on the second extra hole ran his career playoff record to 0-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what I did. I worked four times harder than anybody else out 
there. I can't remember working so hard." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw hit it all over the Firestone Country Club course for four days. He 
made double bogeys. He made sevens on birdie holes. He wandered around trees 
and into traps. He put himself in almost constant jeopardy. But, somehow, he 
stayed in or around the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw and Frost, a native of South Africa who lives in Dallas, completed 
regulation at 276, four under par. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw, who had to overcome still another double bogey, had a closing 68 and 
the steady Frost had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, Frost's third in the last two years on the American tour, was 
worth $180,000 from the total purse of $1 million and pushed his earnings for 
the year to $507,159. 
</P>
<P>
More important, it provided him with a 10-year exemption to PGA Tour events, 
enough to last him until age 39. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw won $108,000 and became only the fifth man to go over $4 million in 
career earnings. Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Kite and Curtis Strange are the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, newly crowned PGA champion, was tied for the lead and had a chance to 
join the playoff until he bogeyed the last two holes for a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, attempting to win a second title in as many weeks, once got to within a 
stroke of the lead, but finished at 278 after a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King survived a lapse in the middle of the final round and shot a 
four-under-par 68 to win the LPGA World Championship by three strokes at 
Buford, Ga., for her sixth victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
King, whose $83,500 first prize lifted her earnings to $609,457 this year, 
appeared on her way to running away to victory when she had an eagle and three 
birdies on the first seven holes. 
</P>
<P>
But she then bogeyed Nos. 9, 11 and 12 to fall into a tie with England's Laura 
Davies with six holes left. 
</P>
<P>
King regained the lead with a birdie on No. 13, a hole Davis bogeyed. King 
knocked in a 10-foot birdie putt on the 15th and coasted to her 20th career 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
She had a 13-under-par 275 total for 72 holes on the hilly, 6,107-yard PineIsle 
Resort course. 
</P>
<P>
Three strokes back were Pat Bradley and Patty Sheehan, both closing with 70-278 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, the 1987 U.S. Open winner, birdied No. 14 to get within a shot, but 
missed a short putt for a double bogey-5 on No. 17 and fell into a tie for 
fourth place with Beth Daniel at 69-279. 
</P>
<P>
Slump-ridden Sandy Lyle of Scotland was omitted from the European Ryder Cup 
team at his own request, he said at the World Series of Golf at Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, he said, was "based entirely on my performance over the last few 
months." 
</P>
<P>
"It was not up to standard. Better to give someone else a chance," Lyle said. 
</P>
<P>
In the World Series of Golf this weekend, the 1988 Masters champion had rounds 
of 74, 74, 77, 72 and finished 17-over par at 297. 
</P>
<P>
The biennial Ryder Cup matches, between leading professionals from the United 
States and Europe, will be played at the Belfry, Sutton-Coldfield, in the 
English midlands, Sept. 22-24.

Woodland Hills West infielder Del Marine remembers when he first noticed the 
aluminum bats that the team from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, was toting around in 
the American Legion World Series. Considering the thunder and lightning that 
visited the Mid-South area over the five days of the tournament, the bats must 
have looked like lighting rods. 
</P>
<P>
And after Guaynabo scored 37 runs in its first five games, it was clearly 
possible that the sparks might again fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on their team was using 33-inch bats that weighed 33 ounces," Marine 
said. "Ours are about 33 inches and weigh a lot less. Those guys swing some 
clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was Woodland Hills that battered the eight-team field to win the series 
title, scoring six runs in the sixth inning to rally past Guaynabo, 11-5, at 
Millington Legion Field on Sunday night. West (39-7) is the first California 
team since 1976 to win the title and the first ever from District 20. The game 
will be televised Tuesday on ESPN at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
For the umpteenth time in West's improbable championship drive, it was a 
combination of players who put the team over the top. One day it was Marine -- 
who was awarded three individual honors for his performance -- and another it 
was the likes of outfielders Jeff Marks or Jason Cohen or shortstop Ricky 
Banuelos, each of whom drove in two runs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his teammates, Cohen played through a variety of injuries, 
including taking 14 stitches in his left knee at the state tournament and 
enduring a strained muscle in his back. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't feel anything on a day like this," said Cohen, who was three for 
five. "Your body's feeling great, the adrenaline's flowing. . . . We were 
awesome, I don't know how we kept doing it. If one person's down, another 
always seems to pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Pat Treend, who defeated Guaynabo, 6-5, in a first-round game on 
Wednesday, provided the pickup Sunday. He entered the game in the fourth inning 
in relief of starter Lance Gibson. Guaynabo (41-10), having scored four runs in 
the fourth, was leading, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Treend retired 16 of 18 batters, struck out six, walked two and allowed one 
harmless single as West roared from behind in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the inning, Banuelos had a two-run double, Marks drove in a run with a 
bases-loaded single and Treend, of all people, kept the inning alive with a 
two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I don't give a . . . about the hitting," Treend said. "I just wanted to 
hold them down." 
</P>
<P>
That he did. Treend ended the West victory tour by striking out the side in the 
ninth and was ceremoniously mugged by his teammates on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
West players walked away with a number of individual awards. Marine received 
three, all based on regional and series play: the George Rulon National Player 
of the Year Award, which includes $2,000 in college scholarship money; the 
Louisville Slugger Award for batting average (17 for 37, .459); and the 
Rawlings Big Stick Award for total bases (24). All of which underscores Cohen's 
team theme, since Marine was only one for three in the final and two for 11 
over the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Carl McFadden, who had three home runs in regional and series play, 
won the Irvin L. (Click) Cowger Award for runs batted in (14).

Chris Patton looks as if he should be out on the football field for Coach Danny 
Ford, but the 300-pound Clemson senior proved he belongs on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Patton beat Danny Green of Jackson, Tenn., 3 and 1, Sunday in the 36-hole final 
of the U.S. Amateur championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty awesome," the 6-foot-1 Patton said after winning the championship 
at Merion Golf Club. "I played as good as I can play. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played as good this week as I've played in a long, long time. There were 
some real good matches. It was no cakewalk." 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Patton was two-over-par for his last 102 holes. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's first 18 holes, Patton took a three-hole lead over the 32-year-old 
Green, who said he helps in his father's optical shop but mostly plays golf. 
Patton increased his lead to 4-up with a three-foot birdie putt on the second 
hole of the final 18. Green lipped a 12-foot birdie attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Green won the fourth hole as Patton drove off the fairway and failed to get his 
second shot out of the deep rough. 
</P>
<P>
But Patton got that back at No. 6 with a 22-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had trouble with his putter most of the day, won the eighth hole 
with a par, while Patton drove into a trap, hit over the green, chipped back 
and two-putted for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Green won the 310-yard, par-four 10th with a 25-foot birdie putt, cutting 
Patton's lead to two. 
</P>
<P>
But the easy-swinging Patton won No. 11 as Green put his second shot in the 
water en route to a double bogey, and conceded a birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, with the consistency that marked his play all week, boosted his lead to 
four again at the 12th, laying his second shot close to the pin for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Green stayed in the match by winning the 14th hole with a par when Patton 
missed a 10-footer and settled for bogey. 
</P>
<P>
After halving 15, Green was three holes down with three holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
He staved off defeat by winning the 16th hole with a par while Patton drove 
into the rough again and two-putted from 18 feet for another bogey. 
</P>
<P>
But on the 222-yard 17th, Green's tee shot landed in a greenside trap snug 
against the lip. He had to take a penalty stroke for an unplayable lie. 
</P>
<P>
Then Green surrendered, giving Patton -- who was 18 inches from the pin in two 
-- the hole and championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the Amateur for the first time and I'm proud of myself," Green said. 
"I played real well." 
</P>
<P>
But he did fault his putting, normally a strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I putt well and don't strike the ball well," Green said. "It was the 
reverse this week. I struck the ball well and didn't putt well."

The Chargers cut strong safety Pat Miller Sunday, leaving 11 players to cut by 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller played one game at linebacker for the Chargers during the 1987 strike 
and was released. He returned to make the team as a safety last year, playing 
eight games before a knee injury ended his season. 
</P>

"He doesn't figure in the top eight guys right now," Charger Coach Dan Henning

ADAMSON REMEMBERED; 
</P>
<P>
'BORN FREE' MOVEMENT: THE WORK GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't as if George Adamson, Kenya's recently slain "Grand Old Man of the 
Bush," didn't know about the increasing dangers from poachers stalking 
wildlife. Adamson, whose success at returning rehabilitated lions to the wild 
inspired the film "Born Free," had been repeatedly urged to leave the Kora 
National Reserve where he was murdered last week, according to Kim Ellis, one 
of the prime encouragers. A Los Angeles native who was visiting her parents in 
Brentwood at the time of Adamson's death, Ellis has worked in Africa with 
Adamson and his colleague Tony Fitzjohn since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Packing to return to Africa as she talked, Ellis pointed out that attitudes 
toward conservationists in Kenya had become increasingly hostile. By 1980, the 
Kenya government, which once supported Adamson's work, "could no longer accept 
his lion rehabilitation program -- it was no longer a priority." 
</P>
<P>
But even so, Adamson, 83, steadfastly remained at Kora, monitoring the lions he 
had previously returned to the wild and working with three lions there in the 
last year. After his lion program officially ended, Adamson had helped to set 
up a nearby leopard rehabilitation project run by Tony Fitzjohn, his closest 
colleague for the last 18 years. But by 1986, the government had also "closed 
down" the leopard camp, Ellis lamented, and native herdsmen had begun moving 
into the reserve, burning acres of bush, bringing livestock into areas where 
lions and leopards freely roamed and poisoning those that got too close to 
their herds. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Adamson had urged Ellis and Fitzjohn to establish a new camp at a reserve 
on friendlier turf. And they did -- the Mkomazi Game Reserve in Northern 
Tanzania, where the government declared the rehabilitation of wildlife to be a 
"priority national project." 
</P>
<P>
Adamson had not yet seen the group's new, 1,300-square-mile reserve, said 
Ellis, but he had planned to move there with them when things at Kora became 
"intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
As for why he didn't leave, she speculated that he felt his work was still at 
Kora, where both his late brother and some of his favorite lions were buried. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the government stopped protecting the land (at Kora) is hard to say. 
It just stopped working," Ellis emphasized, adding that she's not sure what 
will become of the reserve now that its leader is gone. "I don't know if 
they'll close it up. It depends on what the government decides." 
</P>
<P>
For the last nine months, Ellis has been in Southern California raising funds 
for the TonyFitzjohn/George Adamson African Wildlife Preservation Trust. She 
headed back to Africa Friday to attend Adamson's funeral at Kora early this 
week and then to return to the camp in Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
On the bed in the elegant Brentwood home of her parents sat supplies that will 
allow her to continue to live and work in the bush. And, for company, there was 
a copy of Larry King's autobiography and Wolfgang Puck's "Modern French 
Cooking." 
</P>
<P>
While Adamson's murderers were presumed to be Somali robbers and poachers by 
those who witnessed the incident, Ellis claimed that there was little point in 
comparing his death to that of gorilla researcher Dian Fossey or others thought 
to have been killed by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
"George never did anything to antagonize people," she said. "I think 99.9% of 
the people in the area adored George. He was the St. Francis of the animals 
there." 
</P>
<P>
While some have wondered why Adamson would continue driving toward a pickup 
truck that was being robbed by armed men, Ellis reasoned that Adamson 
undoubtedly presumed that those in the truck were visitors en route to his 
camp. But, before Adamson could help them, he and two members of his staff were 
gunned down by men wielding automatic rifles. One member of Adamson's staff 
jumped out of the vehicle, survived and relayed the story to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he (Adamson) was foolhardy. There's only one road there and what 
was he going to do? He was very brave. Was he supposed to back up and race back 
to camp, leaving those people endangered? I'm not surprised he did it. I think 
he was very brave doing it," Ellis insisted. She noted that a standard 
procedure at Adamson's Kora National Reserve was to drive the four miles from 
their camp to the airstrip after hearing the sounds of an airplane arriving. 
</P>
<P>
In the four years that Ellis has spent with Adamson and Fitzjohn in the bush, 
the three had never directly encountered poachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, we would come across poached elephants," she recalled in a slight 
European accent, acquired from the time she spent studying in Europe and from 
living near Adamson, a native of India who grew up in England, and with 
Fitzjohn, who is from London. "But even when the nomadic herdsmen were there, 
George wouldn't go over and curse them out." 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing not to love (about Adamson)," remembered actress Ali 
MacGraw, who once stayed with Adamson and Fitzjohn at Kora and filmed a 
documentary about their work there. "George Adamson had a very powerful 
presence and commitment to the planet. . . . The way he and animals interacted 
spoke for itself. . . . My feeling about Tony and Kim is that they have 
enormous courage (to carry on Adamson's work)." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, MacGraw became chairman of the Mkomazi Project, an endeavor 
Ellis and Fitzjohn will undertake to rehabilitate African wild dogs, cheetahs 
and other endangered species in northern Tanzania. Among other things, MacGraw 
narrated a documentary for the cause. And, at a May fund-raiser at Morton's 
restaurant, she urged other celebrities and supporters of the project to donate 
funds.

MARRIAGE OF EX DOESN'T ALWAYS SPELL RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a mutual friend told Susan that her ex-husband was remarrying, she felt 
relieved. "It's a chapter closing," thought the successful businesswoman, who 
had asked for the divorce and since remarried. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the last chapter. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of her feelings of relief, Susan felt a more insidious emotion 
surface: jealousy. Her ex's second marriage was much more elaborate than their 
own simple ceremony. "He never did this for me," she remembers saying to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Careful not to discuss her feelings with her new husband, Susan worries that 
she shouldn't have gotten so upset about her ex's remarriage. But mental health 
experts say reacting to the marriage of an ex-spouse is natural, even 
psychologically healthy, if you don't take it to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people will feel something on the day of the (ex-spouse's) remarriage or 
the day they find out about it," says Constance Ahrons, USC professor of 
sociology and author of "Divorced Families" (W.W. Norton, 1989). "Even 
something as simple as thinking, 'He really did move on.' (Or) 'She really does 
love someone else.' " 
</P>
<P>
Strolls down the aisle by ex-spouses are becoming more common. Last year, 
nearly 1.5 million divorced people -- 738,000 women and 748,000 men -- 
remarried, says demographer Barbara Foley Wilson of the National Center for 
Health Statistics. That's a 6% increase in remarriages since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
While therapists can't pin down an exact pattern or sequence of reactions, they 
find relief is common, especially among ex-spouses who sought the divorce. One 
husband, on hearing about his ex's imminent remarriage, recalls thinking, 
"Maybe now she'll stop putting out third-party feelers about our getting back 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Other ex-spouses cite a feeling of sadness -- and surprise at that emotion. "I 
felt a sense of loss," says Linda, who split up with her husband after a decade 
of marriage and then found out, four years later, that he was remarrying. A 
legitimate reaction, says Tom Kennon, a UCLA psychotherapist: "Remarriage is 
the final nail in the coffin, signaling the end of the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"To experience a sadness is not necessarily unhealthy," says Dr. Thomas K. 
Ciesla, a psychiatrist at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, Santa Monica. 
"In fact, the healthy thing is to reminisce and grieve, at least for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Mental replays of the ex-spouses' wedding -- down to reception menus and bridal 
bouquets -- are also common, therapists say. "There is a tendency to 
re-experience the feelings surrounding the breakup of the relationship," says 
Ciesla. Perhaps, experts say, it's a last-ditch effort to make sense of the 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
Self-doubt also can occur when an ex-spouse moves on to another relationship. A 
typical question: "Why can this person get along with my ex and I can't?" 
Ex-spouses who haven't remarried may feel left behind. "The message is, 
'Someone else has replaced you,' " says Ahrons. Ex-spouses may face issues of 
aging when their ex remarries, especially if the remarrying ex chooses a much 
younger partner. 
</P>
<P>
Curiosity about how the ex-spouse acts with his new partner is normal too. Says 
Kennon: "If you made a major emotional investment in the marriage, it's common 
to wonder, 'Does he say the same things to her as he did to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inconsequential Details 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly inconsequential details can become sources of aggravation. "If an 
ex-wife didn't take back her maiden name, she often thinks, 'Someone else has 
that name now too,' " notes Ahrons. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the remarriage of an ex-spouse is more difficult to accept, experts 
say, if it occurs rapidly after the divorce; if an ex-spouse has reconciliation 
fantasies; if the original marriage was lengthy; and if the remarrying spouse 
sought the divorce against the partner's wishes. In that last case, says 
Kennon, the partner who didn't seek the divorce may be idealizing the former 
relationship, making the remarriage even tougher to accept. 
</P>
<P>
If the ex-spouses have children together, facing the new marriage is often more 
difficult for both, since it might necessitate such additional changes as 
rearranged visitation schedules or the introduction of step-siblings. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes the opposite is true. Since Linda's ex-husband remarried, she 
finds him more likely to follow the joint-custody schedule involving their 
daughter. "And his new wife has a sensitivity to our daughter's needs that's 
similar to my own," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Linda couldn't bring herself to accept her ex's invitation to the 
wedding. "I decided I wouldn't be comfortable," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that discomfort, she says, stemmed from her own absence of a dating 
partner at that time. "If I had been in a relationship, I probably would have 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Ex-spouses who have developed a civil, even friendly post-divorce relationship 
may have a harder time accepting a former partner's remarriage than those on 
door-slamming terms, says Ahrons. 
</P>
<P>
In her experience, ex-couples who get along -- those she categorizes as 
"perfect pals" and "cooperative colleagues" -- have a more difficult time 
facing the remarriage of an ex-spouse than those who have "angry associate" or 
"fiery foe" relationships. That's because remarriage may alter the friendly 
relationship, she says. Fear of upsetting the new relationship, for instance, 
may rule out such activities as ex-spouses dining together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flip-flopping Emotions 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the ex-spouses' relationship with each other, flip-flopping emotions 
around the time of the wedding are natural, Ahrons finds. She remembers one 
woman changing her mind several times about whether she wanted her children to 
be involved in her ex-husband's wedding. Finally, she gave the go-ahead. On the 
day of the wedding, she felt left out and abandoned. "But it's not that she 
wanted to be there," Ahrons adds. 
</P>
<P>
Handling an ex-spouse's remarriage is easier, say those who have been there, if 
ex-partners remain sensitive to each other's feelings. "My ex told me about his 
remarriage (soon after he decided) so I wouldn't hear about it first from 
mutual friends," says Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Also of help are understanding family members (those who resist the urge to say 
they always knew the original marriage wouldn't pan out). Good friends can ease 
the adjustment for ex-spouses too. "They can help by reassuring the ex-spouse 
of their desirability, especially if he or she is still single," Kennon says. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ahrons knows of one woman who went to her ex's wedding bearing good 
wishes, she acknowledges few people can do this. Ahrons advises ex-spouses: 
"Give in a little to the sad feelings. Sit and talk about them to a close 
friend." That's healthier, she believes, than escaping on a cruise or enjoying 
a shopping spree. Getting involved in a support group may help ex-spouses who 
have a difficult time coping too, Kennon says. 
</P>
<P>
There's no single "normal" way to react when an ex remarries, experts agree. A 
wide range of reactions is normal. But reactions that persist aren't, mental 
health experts warn. How long is too long? It depends on such factors as the 
duration of the original marriage and the time lapsed since the breakup. But 
Ahrons tells clients a week is long enough to wallow in hurt, humiliation or 
sadness. If the news of an ex's remarriage still stings enough to interfere 
significantly with work or social life after a week, professional help is in 
order, Ahrons says. But others say a week is arbitrary, that even if feelings 
persist after that, it's no cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ill Will or Revenge 
</P>
<P>
Another red flag: when fleeting feelings of ill will escalate to nasty revenge. 
Thinking such sarcastic thoughts as "I hope she enjoys round-the-clock 
television sports" are probably pretty normal, therapists say. But more serious 
thoughts of revenge -- 'I hope the hotel they're honeymooning in gets bombed" 
-- are not. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that ex-spouses react in any way to a former partner's remarriage, 
Ahrons speculates, may reflect a bittersweet truth: "Even though we've become a 
divorcing culture, we still consider marriage very final." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Your Ex Remarries 
</P>
<P>
What's Normal: 
</P>
<P>
* Reliving your own wedding. 
</P>
<P>
* Feeling: 
</P>
<P>
* angry. 
</P>
<P>
* sad. 
</P>
<P>
* surprised about feeling sad. 
</P>
<P>
* abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
* relieved, especially if you have already remarried or if you've filed for the 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
* left out, especially if your children are involved in the ex-spouse's 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's Not Normal: 
</P>
<P>
* Having long-term, elaborate wishes for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
* Feeling so sad or obsessed that it interferes with work or social life for 
more than one week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expect Greater Impact If: 
</P>
<P>
* You and your ex-spouse have developed a post-divorce "perfect pal" or 
"cooperative colleague" relationship. 
</P>
<P>
* You and ex-spouse had children together. 
</P>
<P>
* You find out about the wedding after it occurs.

<P>
TRACING A WILD RIVER, JOE KANE WADED INTO DEEP POOLS OF PERIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Admittedly, Joe Kane was no expert on the mysterious Amazon or the 
characteristics of its source tributary, the Apurimac. But there was no 
mistaking what the river had in mind when it bumped him from the raft. 
</P>
<P>
It was sucking him into the brutal and deadly Acomamba Abyss. And he could not 
struggle out. 
</P>
<P>
"In a moment of surprising peace and clarity, I understood that I was 
drowning," he recalled. "I grew angry. Then I quit. I knew that it was my time 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
How did this happen? How did a regular guy like Kane -- a consumer-affairs 
columnist and occasional magazine writer -- wind up on the bottom of one of the 
world's worst, man-eating stretches of white water? Why was he not back home, 
with his bright and beautiful girlfriend? Playing softball? Living the good 
life in San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing better to do at the time," he said, deadpanning a casual, 
self-mocking bravado while nursing a pint of ale at his neighborhood pub. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packing for Peru 
</P>
<P>
So, a few weeks after a casual introduction to a South African adventurer in 
search of a publicist to help him raise money, Kane packed off to Peru to 
chronicle the first expedition ever to travel the length of the world's longest 
river, 4,200 miles from source to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Like a good writer, he intended to make the trip in the safety and relative 
comfort of a borrowed Land Rover. He wanted to be a detached and objective 
4-wheel-drive observer. 
</P>
<P>
But soon, Kane ran out of road. And, to stay with the others, he boarded a 
four-person raft, an inexperienced and reluctant member of the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
He did not perish in the treacherous Acomamba Abyss -- or anywhere else for 
that matter, though not for lack of opportunity. As he recounts in his swiftly 
paced account of the expedition, "Running the Amazon" (Knopf, $19.95), the 
first successful Amazon expedition was chockablock with enough near misses, 
close calls and lucky breaks to shame Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Expedition members -- an unlikely collection of South Africans and Britons, 
Poles and Americans -- overcame obstacles as transient as altitude sickness at 
the Andes' crest and as relentless as miles of murderous river rapids, each one 
bigger, deeper and deadlier than the one before. 
</P>
<P>
Then trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
Merciless Maoist guerrillas intercepted them at one bend in the river; 
trigger-happy Peruvian soldiers at the next; armed and very anxious cocaine 
traffickers waited down river. 
</P>
<P>
All of it might not have been such a problem for a cohesive and disciplined 
team. But a third of the way down river, personal rivalries boiled into open 
mutiny and the 11-member party that descended from the icy, high-altitude 
headwaters dwindled to four before it reached the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Of those four, only two -- Kane and Piotr Chmielinski, a Polish expatriate -- 
traveled nearly all of the Amazon by boat, portaging their craft on foot when 
the river was totally unnavigable. The two others who completed the journey, 
British doctor Kate Durrant and Polish photographer Zbyszek Bzdak, negotiated 
much of the territory by land, bringing in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
A grueling challenge for veteran river runners -- a Swiss team abandoned its 
concurrent expedition when a rafter's leg was crushed in the Acomamba Abyss -- 
the Amazon was a punishing lesson for the novice Kane. His only previous 
river-running experience, he said, was "tubing," or slowly gliding in an inner 
tube, down the lazy Sacramento River near Chico. He spent several years in that 
quaint university town north of Sacramento writing for the respected 
alternative weekly, the Chico News &amp; Review. 
</P>
<P>
He had never sat in a kayak, though the bulk of his Amazon trip was in one, and 
had never been farther south than a vacation in Guatemala, much less set eyes 
on the Amazon or studied its history or ecology. What little Spanish he knew he 
had picked up while playing city-league soccer with migrant workers in Chico. 
He spoke no Portuguese at all for the Brazilian half of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Kane's lack of experience did have its advantages. It lets him leaven his tale 
with his own amusing blunders. He recalls, for example, arriving in Peru with 
ridiculously inappropriate Banana Republic clothing, then impressing his new 
colleagues by inadvertently irritating a pack animal -- and winding up with "a 
warm wad of llama goober" dribbling down his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after an especially grueling day, he crawled onshore and vomited out of 
sheer exhaustion. Five Peruvian peasant women passing by asked where he was 
going. "Brazil," he said proudly, convinced of the self-evident nobility of his 
adventure. The peasants were unimpressed by such folly; one of them simply 
advised: "You should fly." 
</P>
<P>
Kane also recalled the surreal ubiquity of satellite-aided Western culture. At 
one point, upon dragging himself into one remote settlement after weeks in the 
bush, he was stunned and more than a little disappointed to find the local 
children watching the Flintstones on television. 
</P>
<P>
As a novice and journalist, Kane was able to strip away the antiseptic National 
Geographic veneer in which so many classic adventure books wrap their subjects. 
He makes it clear that running the Amazon's length was, in many ways, precisely 
the kind of back-breaking, blister-popping, bug-infested nightmare that 
confirmed city dwellers fear it would be. Tarantulas turned up in his pack, 
venomous snakes outside his tent and disease-laden mosquitoes on every patch of 
exposed skin, regardless of the amount of repellent applied. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Kane said he still suffers a mild form of conjunctivitis that he 
apparently contracted from an insect, as well as burning tendinitis in his 
wrists from the endless hours of paddling. 
</P>
<P>
But those hardships are more than balanced, he said, by memories of the Andes' 
barren beauty and the jungle's splendor; the awe of discovering for himself the 
remarkable remnants of the once glorious Incan culture; and the sheer joy of 
meeting native Quechuan men and women who magically coax a living from the 
impossibly rugged landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in the high Andes, you get an incredible feel for history, a great 
history, because everything -- the people, their towns, the landscape -- still 
feels so ancient," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, modern life was all too evident: in the fetid river cities where 
irreplaceable resources are processed and transshipped; in the forests stripped 
to their stumps; in the highlands where dam-builders' chalked survey marks on 
sheer canyon walls read like a death sentence for the still-untamed river. 
</P>
<P>
"You never feel you are either completely in or out of civilization," he said. 
"You can come upon a city like Iquitos and 10 miles from the town, you are out 
in the middle of the bush again. You feel you are 100 miles from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The closer Kane and Chmielinski came to the river's mouth, the more often they 
saw the jungle's magnificent vegetation shaved off the land for a few hundred 
yards deep on both banks -- as far as the valuable hardwood trees could be 
economically dragged to the river for transport. 
</P>
<P>
That experience persuaded Kane, on returning to America, to volunteer at the 
Rainforest Action Network, a San Francisco environmental group working to save 
that vital resource around the world, from Brazil to Borneo. Besides his other 
work, Kane now edits the group's quarterly journal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Debt to the Rain Forest' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a debt to the rain forests now," he explained. "Having been down there, 
I know that it's going fast and it's going for all the wrong reasons -- simple 
greed." 
</P>
<P>
He rejects government arguments that harvesting the rain forest provides the 
money and clear land to help impoverished Brazilian peasants. Stopovers in the 
region's major riverfront logging towns taught him who benefits -- and who does 
not -- from jungle deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
"To say, 'Let's log the Amazon to help the Brazilian poor' is like saying, 
'Let's log Yosemite to help the South Bronx.' It's ridiculous," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Such observations were made each night in notebooks and microcassette tapes 
Kane carried in a waterproof briefcase. Each day's handwritten notes were read 
into the tape recorder as insurance against some disaster that might send the 
written recollections swirling down the river or blowing into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wise precaution. At one point, Kane said a tremendous blow in some 
rapids crushed the briefcase, bursting a can of insect repellent he had inside 
and letting it smear the ink on several pages. After that, Kane said he made 
sure to send out his recorded notes with every shipment of motion-picture and 
still film left at predetermined drop points along the river. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, writing and recording notes became a painful burden after the 
worst of the 12- and 14-hour days, when Kane said his swollen and bloody hands 
were frozen in crescents the diameter of the paddle he had been gripping. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it was just about the amount of dirt under my fingernails, I told 
myself I had to write every night," he said. Most of the work was done in the 
glow of a candle. "A thousand words a night was my goal -- not always met." 
</P>
<P>
He supplemented his own notes with the personal diaries of several other 
expedition members -- Durrant, Chmielinski, world-class South African kayakers 
Jerome Truran and Tim Biggs, and Wyoming businessman Jack Jourgenson, who ran 
some of the worst white water before returning to Casper to raise enough money 
to complete the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Even during the worst parts of the trip -- as when the money ran low, when he 
became separated from the rest of the team, and when Chmielinski replaced the 
original expedition leader, South African adventurer Francois Odendaal -- Kane 
said he never doubted that he would complete it. 
</P>
<P>
"When it began, I thought I would be with the truck; I thought I could get in 
and drive out whenever I wanted," he said. "Once we got into the abyss, I 
realized that was not true. We were miles and miles from the nearest road, and 
at the bottom of a sheer rock canyon. I could not get out. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we were out of the abyss, I could have left, I suppose. But at that 
point, there was a sense of investment. I realized that I had put so much into 
it at that point that I could not go without finishing it." 
</P>
<P>
He still, however, was not sure it was possible to finish. Plowing through the 
white water in the eastern Andes -- by far the hardest part of the journey, 
with the expedition making as little as 500 yards a day, despite long hours and 
perilous risks -- had taken far longer than anyone anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
After three months, when the adventurers had expected to be finishing their 
journey, they had, in fact, moved only 600 miles and were still deep in Peru. 
They still had to cover 1,600 miles just to reach Brazil; from there, they had 
to traverse another 2,000 miles to dip their paddles in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
36,000 Strokes a Day 
</P>
<P>
Kane said he and Chmielinski labored on anyway -- "50 strokes a minute, 36,000 
strokes a day" while dodging poisonous Bushmaster snakes and marveling at 
pink-and-gray fresh-water dolphins -- until a most unlikely epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
"We came around this one bend in the river and saw the Iquitos skyline," he 
said, recalling the isolated, "vaguely Mediterranean" river outpost deep in the 
Peruvian jungle. "I thought I was looking at San Francisco and Piotr thought he 
saw Krakow. At that point, somehow, we both knew that we could make it." 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, on Feb. 19, 1986, they did, indeed, make it, dipping 
calloused hands into the suddenly translucent green water, drawing it to their 
parched lips and tasting salt. 
</P>
<P>
Just as suddenly as the adventurers realized they had reached the sea, the 
expedition was whisked to the United States by a network morning news program 
they had reached by phone from Belem. 
</P>
<P>
"One day we were camping in mud at the mouth of the Amazon, and the next day we 
were in $300-a-night suites at the Plaza Athenee (hotel) in New York," Kane 
recalled, still sounding amazed by the alacrity of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sudden and unceremonious end to the expedition, Kane maintains 
contact with those who finished the trip. Chmielinski is an environmental 
consultant in Washington, D.C.; Bzdak is a photographer for the Casper, Wyo., 
Star-Tribune; Durrant runs a medical clinic for Bolivian peasants. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the trip, of course, marked only the beginning of Kane's writing 
process -- a challenge he said was nearly as daunting as the expedition itself. 
It took Kane two years and five complete drafts to find the right tone and set 
the right pace. 
</P>
<P>
What he discovered as he wrote was that the trip had somehow developed in him 
the sense to effectively allocate his energy, focus his thoughts and sort out 
whatever was extraneous to the immediate task at hand -- a revelation that also 
prompted him to propose to his girlfriend, lawyer Elyse Axell, who is now his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing was so much like paddling that raft on that big river: you have the 
whole enormous task ahead of you," he said. "You just have to do it one stroke 
at a time, one word at a time, one page at a time."

The scene: "Tommy" at the Universal Amphitheater Thursday, featuring The Who 
(Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle), plus guest stars Elton John, 
Billy Idol, Steve Winwood, Patti LaBelle and Phil Collins. This was undoubtedly 
the hottest ticket around; a publicist who couldn't come up with party passes 
for an elected official was threatened by the official's aide. Several 
charities benefited from the $1.4 million estimated net proceeds: The Gilbert 
W. Lindsay Children's Center, the United Friends of the Children and the 
Westside Children's Center will equally divide $1 million; the remainder will 
be split equally between the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and the 
Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Foundation. Following the sold-out performance 
was a party on the Universal Tour for what seemed like most of the audience. 
They ate, won stuffed animals on midway games, rode the merry-go-round and tore 
Who posters off the walls while the A-list partied it up nearby in a 
semi-secluded area. Security was tight as would-be gate-crashers came up with 
every reason known to mankind why they should be inside. 
</P>
<P>
The buzz: The Who's performance of "Tommy," followed by another set by the 
group, won rave after rave from the audience. It was pretty obvious that the 
crowd was ecstatically re-living the best years of their lives. Men and women 
approaching middle age showed no embarrassment while dancing in the aisles and 
playing air guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: Hanging out backstage during the performance were Sylvester 
Stallone, Fox's Barry Diller, Bianca Jagger, Elton John, Phil Collins, Atlantic 
Records chairman Ahmet Ertegun and wife Mica, Alana Stewart and Madonna. At the 
post-party were the Who, John's songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, Patti 
LaBelle, rock promoter Bill Graham, Lionel and Brenda Richie, Whoopi Goldberg, 
Billy Idol, Barbara and Timothy Leary, producer Douglas Cramer, Frank Stallone, 
former L.A. Clipper Norm Nixon, Irving and Shelli Azoff (he's chairman of MCA 
Music Entertainment Group, she was the benefit chairperson), James Brolin and 
Michael Landon. 
</P>
<P>
That was then, this is now: Then: Men with long hair and ponytails. Now: Men 
with long hair, ponytails and bald spots. Then: Smoking pot during the show. 
Now: Making business deals during the show. Then: Waving your fists in the air 
and singing along with the chorus. Now: Waving your fists in the air and 
singing along with the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Dress mode: Dress was split between leather minis or pants and shaghead 
hair-dos and the more upscale hip baggy business suit look. 
</P>
<P>
The food: Along Came Mary's extensive spread included pizzas, fajitas, mini 
hamburgers, a fruit stand, fish and chips and English bangers, fruit, popcorn, 
an ice cream sundae bar and enough cookies and brownies to cause instant sugar 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I was amazed at how hard that group worked," said Shelli Azoff, about 
the Who and the other performers. "They were here until midnight last night. 
And, you know, it wasn't a party. They were working. And they didn't even get 
paid for this performance." Patti LaBelle admitted to intense stage fright. "I 
thought I was going to forget the lyrics, I thought I was going to fall or 
something," said the singer, who appeared on stage in a 60-pound black and 
fuchsia dress. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of one to 10: "This party is so definite!" said one enthusiastic 
guest. JEANNINE STEIN

GLOBE'S 'SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL' GOES LIGHT ON THE VITRIOL 
</P>

<P>
How refreshing. Craig Noel's staging of "The School for Scandal" that opened 
over the weekend at the Old Globe, under the stars and under the path of 
airplanes headed for Lindbergh Field, doesn't go for the jugular. It goes for 
the glitter. Occasionally, it hits the gold. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from benefiting hugely from the large and unmatched presence of Paxton 
Whitehead, who as Sir Peter Teazle is given an impromptu prologue that sets the 
tone of the production ("It is with deep regret," he quips, "that the role 
usually played by Paxton Whitehead will be played by Paxton Whitehead"), this 
is as sunny a version as you're likely to come across of Richard Brinsley 
Sheridan's attack on the bad behavior of the 18th-Century upper crust. But 
alfresco, under an August moon, vitriol is easier to forget. 
</P>
<P>
What this "Scandal" is, is mostly what it's not: a benevolent, rather than 
malevolent, comedy. No gimmicks. No serious echoes of "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses." No lurid symbols of outrageous decadence. Only a deliberate 
cross-period connection with the National Enquirer, People magazine and 
Hogarth's "Marriage a la Mode" (in designer Steven Rubin's sumptuous, mirrored 
sets) and an inconsistent urge towards caricature with make-up and costume (the 
work of the excellent Robert Wojewodski). 
</P>
<P>
The cartooning is particularly emphatic when it comes to those fervent apostles 
of gossip and rumor: Snake (a weaselly Robert Phalen), Sir Benjamin Backbite 
(Nicholas Martin, all bows), his uncle Crabtree (Mitchell Edmonds, all 
furbelows) and the bloated Mrs. Candour (Linda Hoy, venomously understated in 
pink hair and chartreuse gown). 
</P>
<P>
A jolly "Scandal," then, and only mildly poisonous, in which the text is 
streamlined to contain mostly the juicy, farcical parts, and in which some 
scenes -- leave it to the impish Noel -- are cleverly transposed from the terra 
firma interior of rooms to the rocking interior of a moving coach. 
</P>
<P>
Its comedy runs on the customary two tracks: the war between the Teazles and 
temperamental differences of the Surface brothers and how they are tricked and 
uncovered by their newly-arrived uncle, Sir Oliver (Henry J. Jordan). William 
Anton is just enough of a dullard as Joseph Surface to be believably 
transparent in his hypocrisy, while Ray Chambers has sexy good looks (if not 
real pizazz) as the profligate Charles. Between them they deliver serviceable 
performances that never quite hit any peaks. The timing on the famous screen 
scene in Charles' quarters seemed laggard on opening night, with the laughs a 
beat or two behind the action. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of slight miscalculation suggests a need still for fine-tuning. 
Between the Teazles as well. Whitehead, of course, is splendid -- a big basset 
of a Sir Peter, with a voice like a bassoon, but Lynne Griffin, who has the 
motions in place as Lady Teazle lacks the vocal thunder to match. This 
undermines her imperiousness and weakens their scenes together. One brainstorm 
that steals the show is the cunning puppy dog Sir Peter takes for walks. Not a 
real one, but almost. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the cast ranges from excellent to bland. Navarre T. Perry is a 
solidly faithful friend as Rowley and Erica Rogers a perfectly-named Lady 
Sneerwell, her face perpetually contorted, but Karen Vesper's Maria is so 
colorless as to almost fade from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Such minor inconsistencies mar what is otherwise a spirited concoction for a 
summer night. And all is, after all, still fixable. . . .

MEYER OFFERS A STUDY OF LOVE IN 'THE GEOGRAPHY OF LUCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the struggle between good and evil . . . it's easier to dramatize evil. We 
saw that in Marlane Meyer's first two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish." 
</P>
<P>
"The Geography of Luck," which opened Saturday night at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center (after an earlier production at South Coast Repertory), is again set in 
a tawdry landscape: Las Vegas. And it ends with a story about a person eating a 
snake. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the snake doesn't have all the lines. Meyer's hero (Arliss 
Howard) and heroine (Deirdre O'Connell) make the breakthrough that we were 
hoping they'd make. Life isn't just a matter of eating or being eaten. 
</P>
<P>
A love story, then -- eventually. But one that demonstrates that the walls 
between two people don't come down easily. Meyer has an uncommon sympathy for 
the male point of view here. She sees that it's not a simple thing for a man to 
give in to the female in himself, a requisite if he's ever going to love a real 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it easy for a woman to relinquish her impulse to punish males, for 
reasons just as deeply-rooted in her history. Actors Howard and O'Connell show 
us two busted-up people achieving intimacy an inch at a time, with many a 
glance at the door. Who finally takes the bull by the horns? The woman. This is 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Geography of Luck" is not realistic in manner, though, and there are problems 
with that. Meyer finds a B-movie glamour in strippers, ex-cons, shady 
leased-car operations and rich women who have more than a few miles on them, 
and the play at times seems a goof on yesterday's stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Tyrrell ankles onto Howard's leased-car lot and works her way up to a 
"test drive" like Ida Lupino sizing up some teen-age gas jockey, circa 1948. 
The point may be that we are still trapped in yesterday's sex games, but so 
much love is lavished on this one stylistically (David Schweizer directed) that 
we almost seem to be envying the '40s. Mixed signals here. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's characters also have an unfortunate way of deserting hard, concrete 
speech (something she's very good at) for such generalizations as "a man is not 
a man without a language" and "we appease our appetite for diversity with 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Anybody is liable to come out with something like this, but especially Howard's 
old cellmate and true spiritual father, played by Tom Rosqui. Rosqui has a 
wonderful scene with O'Connell when she comes to see him in prison, but he's 
doesn't know what to do with the philosophizing, and you can't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
The play goes better, though, than it did at South Coast. Not that the cast is 
necessarily more acute, or that director Schweizer has a firmer grasp of it 
intellectually. But he understands its music better. 
</P>
<P>
It is a play of many small and rather cryptic scenes. Rather than ending each 
of them in a blackout, Schweizer and his designers (John Iacovelli, set; 
Douglas D. Smith, lights; Gregory Poe, costumes) give us something to watch 
between scenes -- a revolving light stanchion, maybe, to remind us that we're 
in glitzy Las Vegas; or perhaps just the sight of an actor going offstage. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting how effective that can be if the actor goes off in character. 
Rather than an evening of dots and dashes, the play finds connection. 
</P>
<P>
Schweizer has also taken some of the direness out of the older male characters. 
John Considine doesn't play Howard's father as a dead-eyed crook, but as a guy 
with some concern for his son -- not much but some. And Garrett Morris isn't 
necessarily up to the devil's business with his mojo, at least not from his 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The Geography of Luck" also plays nicely against LATC's "Boys' Life," another 
script about men trying to come to terms with the female principle. One could 
also relate it to LATC's third current play, "The Marriage of Bette and Boo," 
in which another young man confronts what his father and mother did to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, though, "The Geography of Luck" is worth seeing because it's a play 
by Marlane Meyer, a writer with a real gift for language -- when it's her 
language and not psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays at 514 S. Spring St. Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with Saturday and 
Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Closes Oct. 15. Tickets $22-$26. (213) 627-5599.

INTERPRETATION KEY TO HOT SUMMERFEST

SummerFest '89 continues to surprise its Sherwood Hall audiences -- and for all 
the right reasons. Some surprises have come from exotic repertory -- rare 
specimens such as the recent Mel Powell opus String Quartet and Edward Elgar's 
Piano Quintet. But even when the programming has not been that unusual, the 
interpretations have consistently offered new insights into familiar music. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's concert to a full house of about 500 listeners provided two such 
unexpected journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Ravel's F Minor String Quartet, a staple of the quartet circuit, usually 
receives a kid-glove approach that savors its translucent harmonies and hovers 
over its delicate textures. In the hands of, say, the Tokyo String Quartet, the 
piece borders on a precious parody of every flowery textbook definition of 
musical Impressionism. Friday's Ravel offering was quite another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an ensemble that has long worked together to produce a finely blended 
sound, the four SummerFest string players do not regularly work together. 
Violinists Masuko Ushioda and Julie Rosenfeld, and violist Toby Hoffman exhibit 
strong, individual musical personalities, which gave both a less refined 
texture and a far more energetic, vibrant interpretation of the piece. Bold, 
animated, even angular describe the three fast movements. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ravel piece's slow movement, Hoffman's luminous, sensual solo was 
nothing less than a revelation. Second violinist Rosenfeld (she is the Colorado 
String Quartet's first violin) played with equal bravura to Ushioda's 
forthright lead. Only the overly proper -- almost aloof -- cellist Peter Reijto 
failed to share this unusual but vigorous vision of the work. 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Cho-Liang Lin made Beethoven's E-flat Piano Trio, Op. 70, No. 2, soar 
with his simultaneously elegant and passionate playing. Lin's enthusiasm for 
the work riveted this listener's attention from the first phrase. He was 
well-partnered at the keyboard by David Golub, whose crisp, well-accented 
realization of the score exploited its asymmetrical phrases and structure with 
uncommon grace. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Ralph Kirshbaum shared this approach to the Beethoven composition, and 
his phrasing admirably mirrored Lin's. But in contrast to Lin's ever-smiling 
sonority, Kirshbaum rarely emerged from a labored grimace. 
</P>
<P>
Between the Beethoven Trio and the Ravel Quartet, five SummerFest wind players 
gave Hindemith's Kleine Kammermusik, Op. 24, No. 2, an emotionally restrained 
but engaging performance, one that refuted the work's reputation as a relic of 
well-crafted neoclassical carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
On most programs, this reading would have been exemplary, especially with 
bassoonist Dennis Michel's plaintive declamations and flutist Damian 
Bursill-Hall's deftly sculpted lines. (The other players were oboist Allan 
Vogel, clarinetist David Peck and Richard Todd, French horn.) 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, however, it was diminished by its stellar company.

OLD GLOBE'S 'SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL' GOES LIGHT ON THE VITRIOL 
</P>

<P>
How refreshing. Craig Noel's staging of "The School for Scandal" that opened 
over the weekend at the Old Globe, under the stars and under the path of 
airplanes headed for Lindbergh Field, doesn't go for the jugular. It goes for 
the glitter. Occasionally, it hits the gold. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from benefitting hugely from the large and unmatched presence of Paxton 
Whitehead, who as Sir Peter Teazle is given an impromptu prologue that sets the 
tone of the production ("It is with deep regret," he quips, "that the role 
usually played by Paxton Whitehead will be played by Paxton Whitehead"), this 
is as sunny a version as you're likely to come across of Richard Brinsley 
Sheridan's attack on the bad behavior of the 18th-Century upper crust. But 
alfresco, under an August moon, vitriol is easier to forget. 
</P>
<P>
What this "Scandal" is, is mostly what it's not: a benevolent, rather than 
malevolent, comedy. No gimmicks. No serious echoes of "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses." No lurid symbols of outrageous decadence. Only a deliberate 
cross-period connection with the National Enquirer, People magazine and 
Hogarth's "Marriage a la Mode" (in designer Steven Rubin's sumptuous, mirrored 
sets) and an inconsistent urge towards caricature with make-up and costume (the 
work of the excellent Robert Wojewodski). 
</P>
<P>
The cartooning is particularly emphatic when it comes to those fervent apostles 
of gossip and rumor: Snake (a weaselly Robert Phalen), Sir Benjamin Backbite 
(Nicholas Martin, all bows), his uncle Crabtree (Mitchell Edmonds, all 
furbelows) and the bloated Mrs. Candour (Linda Hoy, venomously understated in 
pink hair and chartreuse gown). 
</P>
<P>
A jolly "Scandal," then, and only mildly poisonous, in which the text is 
streamlined to contain mostly the juicy, farcical parts, and in which some 
scenes -- leave it to the impish Noel -- are cleverly transposed from the terra 
firma interior of rooms to the rocking interior of a moving coach. 
</P>
<P>
Its comedy runs on the customary two tracks: the war between the Teazles and 
temperamental differences of the Surface brothers and how they are tricked and 
uncovered by their newly arrived uncle, Sir Oliver (Henry J. Jordan). William 
Anton is just enough of a dullard as Joseph Surface to be believably 
transparent in his hypocrisy, while Ray Chambers has sexy good looks (if not 
real pizazz) as the profligate Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Between them they deliver serviceable performances that never quite hit any 
peaks. The timing on the famous screen scene in Charles' quarters seemed 
laggard on opening night, with the laughs a beat or two behind the action. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of slight miscalculation suggests a need still for fine-tuning. 
Between the Teazles as well. Whitehead, of course, is splendid -- a big basset 
of a Sir Peter, with a voice like a bassoon, but Lynne Griffin, who has the 
motions in place as Lady Teazle lacks the vocal thunder to match. This 
undermines her imperiousness and weakens their scenes together. One brainstorm 
that steals the show is the cunning puppy dog Sir Peter takes for walks. Not a 
real one, but almost. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the cast ranges from excellent to bland. Navarre T. Perry is a 
solidly faithful friend as Rowley and Erica Rogers a perfectly-named Lady 
Sneerwell, her face perpetually contorted, but Karen Vesper's Maria is so 
colorless as to almost fade from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Such minor inconsistencies mar what is otherwise a spirited concoction for a 
summer night. And all is, after all, still fixable. . . .

Sundays, 8 p.m., until Oct.11. Tickets: $14-$25; (619) 239-2255.

Said Mel Brooks, star and director of such film comedies as "Blazing Saddles," 
"High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs": "I don't mind being the Jerry Lewis clown; in 
fact, I rather enjoy it. But there are times when I would like to do things of 
a deeper, more philosophical nature." Still, he told the London newspaper, the 
Guardian, he is limited by his funny-man image. Most people in Hollywood, he 
said, are unaware that "Mel Brooks was probably the only 9-year-old Jew in 
Brooklyn who was reading Dostoevsky." Claudia Puig

Actor Martin Sheen took his crusade to help the homeless to the streets of 
Hollywood while accepting his star on the Walk of Fame. "The sidewalks of 
Hollywood are known all over the world as the Walk of Fame, but many sidewalks 
in America could be known as the 'Walk of Shame' because of the 4 million 
homeless people residing on them full-time," Sheen said Friday as he received 
the 1,897th Hollywood star. His 30-year career has included such movies as 
"Apocalypse Now" and "Wall Street." Sheen, 49, in his role as honorary mayor of 
Malibu, recently declared the upscale beach community a sanctuary for the 
homeless. The actor, flanked by his wife, Janet, and sons Emilio Estevez and 
Charlie Sheen, asked the crowd to pray with him for the 400,000 homeless 
children. Claudia Puig

Roseanne Barr, the hefty star of the hit TV series "Roseanne," was slapped with 
a lawsuit that claims she paid "thugs" $50 to beat a celebrity photographer as 
he took pictures of her. Ralph Dominguez claims in a Superior Court suit filed 
last week that he was photographing Barr in her car outside the trendy 
restaurant Spago on July 14 when the alleged beating took place. The suit, 
which seeks unspecified damages, said several men approached the car Barr was 
in and spoke with her. She allegedly paid them $50, after which they began to 
beat the photographer, according the suit. Claudia Puig

The wannabe "Mrs. David Letterman" is at it again. Margaret Ray, 37, was 
charged last week with trespassing on the grounds of Letterman's New Canaan, 
Conn., home, marking the fifth time she has been caught there. The talk-show 
host told police to send her away with a warning, but court officials later 
said Ray should be arrested and officers caught up with her at the New Canaan 
train station. She was jailed on $10,000 bail and could be in big trouble, 
since she was ordered to stay away from Letterman's home as part of her 
conviction for trespassing there in 1988. Ray's obsession with Letterman 
surfaced in 1988, when she was caught driving his Porsche to New Jersey. She 
had identified herself to a toll collector as Mrs. David Letterman and 
introduced her 3-year-old son as David Jr. Claudia Puig

KIROV BALLET PERFORMS 'PAQUITA' AND CONTEMPORARY MINIATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saturday Kirov program in Segerstrom Hall seemed like old times: the same 
mix of "Chopiniana," "Paquita" and contemporary miniatures that the company 
offered on the final night of its 1986 engagement in Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Paquita" remains one of the glories in the Kirov repertory: a suite drawn from 
a 19th-Century Petipa classic that tests, molds and displays the dancers 
technically but also allows each soloist to make a personal statement. 
</P>
<P>
Yulia Makhalina hasn't yet the consummate technical authority required for the 
prima ballerina role, but she danced stylishly, with gorgeous line, partnered 
by the conscientious but effortful Eldar Aliev. 
</P>
<P>
The trio found Irina Chistiakova technically uneven but Veronika Ivanova 
perfectly suited to the lacy network of beaten steps and small turns in her 
variation. In the solo that Mikhail Baryshnikov interpolated into his "Don 
Quixote," Andrei Garbuz looked very polished indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The five major women's variations juxtaposed dancers who have become familiar 
this season (Makhalina, Zhanna Ayupova) with others not prominently cast until 
Saturday (Elvira Krylova, Elena Martinson). Inevitably, though, they were 
dominated by Tatiana Terekhova, a senior Kirov luminary seen at her most 
majestic and serene. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Victor Fedotov adopted faster tempos than the dancers faced in 1986 
-- indeed, faster tempos than American Ballet Theatre or Dance Theatre of 
Harlem adopt in their "Paquita" productions -- and helped enhance the vibrant 
attacks and intricate footwork that give this ballet its distinctive 
neo-Spanish flavor. 
</P>
<P>
All of the modern pieces looked as if bravura stunts had been added to the 
choreographies at the last moment -- none more so than Boris Eifman's "Adagio" 
(to Albinoni), a study of group solidarity versus individual freedom. Here the 
intense Evgeny Neff would periodically stop his melodramatic flailing to 
execute an air-turn with a split-leap termination or something equally 
difficult and out of character. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the hyper-gymnastic adagio from Oleg Vinogradov's "Knight in a 
Tiger's Skin" (music by Alexei Machavariani) lost all sense of human 
relationships in its relentless pursuit of startling balances. And there were 
times when even Eldar Aliev and Tatiana Ariskina could not smoothly unsnarl 
themselves from one another's interlocking limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Two pieces by Dmitri Bryantsev proved engaging not so much for their obvious 
dramatic content as their formal movement values. Tracing a path from anguished 
oppression to a sense of hope, "The Conception" (music by Arvo Part) contrasted 
brief, galvanic pulsations with sustained gymnastic partnering gambits; limp 
sprawling with forceful linear statements. Vanda Lubkovskaya and Andrei Bosov 
danced everything powerfully. 
</P>
<P>
Blithely performed by Irina Chistiakova and Yuri Fateyev, Bryantsev's jokey 
character showpiece "Pas de Deux in the Style of the Thirties" (music by 
Shostakovich) played inventively with asymmetrical body-shapes and other 
surprising, anti-classical locutions.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A CANDID LOOK AT SOVIET LIFE AND SOME TREASURES FROM JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgi Gavrilov's "Confession: A Chronicle of Alienation" is the latest in a 
spate of documentaries from the Soviet Union that are breathtaking in their 
candor and in their bold, impressionistic style. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this film -- which the UCLA Film Archive is presenting Tuesday at 8 
p.m. in Melnitz Theater, with Gavrilov present -- is so bravura that it 
counteracts the bleakness one would expect from the chronicle of a young, 
hippie-esque drug addict. Gavrilov manages to make his subject's addiction, his 
anti-Marxist/Leninist views and his burgeoning spirituality a sharp critique of 
rigid, oppressive Soviet life without taking away the young man's 
responsibility for his condition. A remarkable film. 
</P>
<P>
The archive's "The Cutting Edge II" series continues Thursday at 8 p.m. in 
Melnitz Theater with Derek Jarman's apocalyptic, surreal "The Last of England" 
(1987), envisioning Britain after the fall of government, and Saturday at 8 
with longtime Godard associate Anne Marie Mieville's disappointing "My Favorite 
Story" (1988). Mieville's debut feature is an intricately textured and 
structured account of three generations of women and their longings that is 
surprisingly conventional and uninvolving in effect. Information: (213) 
206-8013, 206-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
"Horse" (1941) and "The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail" make up the first of 
three double-feature, weeklong engagements of Akira Kurosawa's earliest films, 
starting Friday at the Little Tokyo Cinema 2. "The Most Beautiful" (1944) and 
"One Wonderful Sunday" (1947) open Sept. 8, and the series concludes with 
"Sanshiro Sugata" (1943) and "Sanshiro Sugata, Part II," beginning Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Horse" was directed by Kurosawa's mentor, Kajiro Yamamoto, but he gave 
Kurosawa, as his assistant director, such latitude that Yamamoto himself has 
said that "he was much more than that; he was more like my other self." 
Kurosawa collaborated on the script as well as served as second-unit director, 
responsible for the rugged location sequences while Yamamoto handled the studio 
interiors. Although "Horse" is a seamless work, there are several instances 
when the film takes off with such dash and vigor that the signature of Kurosawa 
is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
The film is a beautiful and stirring drama of peasant life with a Renoir-like 
reverence for nature. It centers on a pretty, teen-age girl (Hideko Takamine, 
already a major star) whose love for her horse represents an escape from a 
harsh, impoverished existence exacerbated by a chronic clash of wills with her 
no-nonsense mother (Chieko Takahisa). The household also includes the girl's 
farmer father (Kamatari Fujiwara, who was to become a Kurosawa regular), four 
younger children and an elderly grandmother (Kaoru Futaba). 
</P>
<P>
If Yamamoto, a skilled director in his own right, gave Kurosawa considerable 
latitude and opportunity, Kurosawa has in turn spoken of his debt to his 
teacher. There is a strong humanist sentiment in "Horse" attributable to 
Yamamoto that has characterized Kurosawa's work ever since, but the 
foreshadowing of Kurosawa's own dynamic style occurs in a scene where the girl 
rides her horse, galloping alongside the train bearing her younger brother to 
Tokyo, that anticipates all the great Kurosawa tracking shots to come. Another 
perfectly sustained scene has the girl, returning home after a year's absence, 
trying to locate her horse's colt in a large herd. (The Kurosawa twist is to 
have the animal seek her out.) 
</P>
<P>
Completed toward the end of World War II under stringent conditions that 
demanded that Kurosawa make full use of the resources of the camera, "The Men 
Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail" parodies an old Kabuki drama: a famous general 
and his retainers must disguise themselves as monks to pass a checkpoint held 
by the forces of the enemy, who is the general's brother. This sly and 
garrulous 59-minute comedy of manners turns on whether or not the young 
official (Susumu Fujita) at the checkpoint recognizes the general. Kurosawa 
subtly managed to uphold humanist values in the midst of war, but the film 
ironically offended both the wartime militarists and the subsequent Occupation 
censor and was not released until 1953. Information: (213) 687-7077.

UNIONS TURN TO ORGANIZING WHITE-COLLAR PROFESSIONALS 
</P>

What do auto workers in Detroit and attorneys from the county Public Defenders 
Office have in common? Blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals are 
often labor adversaries, but the assembly-line worker in Michigan and public 
defender working in a San Diego County courtroom may soon be represented by the 
same union. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four months, the United Auto Workers quietly have been organizing 
about 160 attorneys and 60 investigators from the public defenders office into 
a union. The lawyers and investigators are part of a growing trend in 
California, where blue-collar unions are competing for the hearts and minds of 
the state's public-sector lawyers and other white-collar professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW and Teamsters have emerged as the most aggressive recruiters of deputy 
district attorneys, public defenders and legal aid lawyers in the state and 
nationally. The two unions have gone head-to-head in the battle for attorneys 
in a few California counties, but the UAW has a big edge in the recruiting war, 
which is being led by UAW District 65, based in New York.

UAW Gaining Membership 
</P>
<P>
District 65 vice president Dwight Loines said from New York that the union 
represents about 5,000 attorneys, paralegals and law clerks in 30 states, most 
of them independent employees of the federally funded legal services program. 
However, in New York City and Long Island, the UAW represents about 1,000 
community defenders who are categorized as private employees and contract with 
the city and Nassau County, Loines said. 
</P>
<P>
One labor expert called white-collar professionals in the public sector, 
including lawyers, a fertile field for traditional unions whose blue-collar 
membership in the private sector has been declining steadily for the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, workers in the public sector have seen a decline in 
government spending and are becoming increasingly concerned about working 
conditions, while demanding better pay and benefits. In California, many public 
employees are forsaking independent employee associations in favor of labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Massenburg, District 65's chief organizer in Northern California, said 
the union represents about 900 legal aid and California Rural Legal Assistance 
attorneys in the state, including San Diego County. The nonprofit legal aid 
offices are independent and funded by the Legal Services Corp., which was 
established by Congress in 1973. The union negotiates with a management team 
representing each office. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, District 65 recently organized about 210 employees at 
Bancroft-Whitney in San Francisco. The company is a major legal publisher in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If the UAW succeeds in organizing the public defenders in San Diego, it will 
mark the first time the union has organized county-employed attorneys in the 
state, said Terry Skotnes, District 65's chief Southern California organizer. 
However, the San Diego County Employees Assn., which currently represents the 
public defenders, is expected to challenge the UAW's petition to serve as the 
attorneys' bargaining unit and decertify the association at a hearing next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Felt Slighted 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Marsha Duggan, who has led the effort to unionize public defenders, 
said she and her colleagues felt they were not being adequately represented by 
the employees group. She complained that lawyers were lumped in with 
architects, health-care professionals and other white-collar workers in 
bargaining sessions with the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We were represented at the last session by an architect. Nobody in our office 
was aware that we had an opportunity to become part of the bargaining process. 
We weren't aware of who our representative was until our contract was 
negotiated. . . . The idea of an architect knowing what our needs are was 
appalling. We have interests and needs that are different. We need a bargaining 
unit more closely aligned to our needs," Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Warshawsky, a lawyer with the Public Defenders Office in Solano County, 
echoed Duggan's complaint. The Solano County public defenders and deputy 
district attorneys were organized into a single bargaining unit by the 
Teamsters last October. Warshawsky complained that the Solano County Employees 
Assn. frequently ignored the lawyers' interests during contract talks because 
they were a relatively small group. 
</P>
<P>
"There were too many cooks spoiling the soup. . . . When you try to make too 
many people happy, you're going to make some unhappy. We felt we were too small 
a group for the association to look out for our particular needs and 
interests," Warshawsky said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presentations Were Requested 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jacqueline Crowle, who also was involved in the organizing drive in 
San Diego County, said the lawyers contacted several unions, including the 
Teamsters and UAW, and invited them to make a presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We listened to several representatives and voted for the UAW," Crowle said. 
"District 65 is fairly well-known for the work it's done in the legal aid 
services. We felt it had the best track record." 
</P>
<P>
Crowle said the drive to affiliate with an international union began earlier in 
the year in a series of meetings involving public defenders from the downtown, 
Chula Vista, El Cajon and Juvenile Hall offices. 
</P>
<P>
"We had these meetings to see what interest there was among our colleagues, 
whether they wanted to stay with the CEA or look for a new bargaining unit. We 
had presentations from the SEIU (Service Employees International Union), AFSCME 
(the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) and others, 
but the overwhelming support was for the UAW," Crowle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Called Undecided 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bardsley, head of the public defenders office declined to comment on the 
drive by his staff to unionize. However, Richard Gates, a veteran defense 
attorney, said a large group of attorneys are still undecided about which union 
will represent them. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said, "If I were working with the UAW, I would be working harder to get 
more support. There's nothing that binds us right now to accept the UAW as our 
union, even if they are the central figure in decertifying the CEA. While there 
is a strong feeling in our office that we should be unionized and be 
represented by professional people, I can't say whether that feeling extends to 
the UAW specifically." 
</P>
<P>
If the UAW's organizing drive succeeds in San Diego County, local public 
defenders would form a unit that would be affiliated with UAW Local 635, the 
international union's and District 65's bargaining agent for its legal service 
members. 
</P>
<P>
District 65 was founded as the Distributive Workers of America, which was a 
textile union in the 1930s, and later was affiliated with the Hospital Workers 
Union in New York City. Its name is a leftover from the old Congress of 
Industrial Organization's practice of giving charter numbers to its member 
unions. District 65 was the 65th charter given by the congress. The union 
affiliated itself with the UAW in 1980 and has concentrated its efforts in 
organizing the legal services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition May Be Challenged 
</P>
<P>
The UAW's Skotnes said the public defenders may be able to sever their ties to 
the CEA by early next year. However, CEA sources, who requested anonymity, said 
the association was planning to challenge the UAW petition by arguing that it 
was filed in an untimely manner. If the CEA position is upheld by a hearing 
officer, the UAW would have to wait another year before it could petition 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The CEA is not an appropriate bargaining unit for them to be in," Skotnes 
said. "They have to sever into a smaller unit with a clearer community of 
interest where they could bargain appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
However, in some counties where the UAW and Teamsters have attempted to 
organize attorneys in the public sector, the unions' detractors have succeeded 
in keeping them out by arguing that lawyers and auto workers really do not have 
much in common. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case in Tulare County, where both the UAW and Teamsters lost out 
to the local county employees association. Tulare County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Bill Yoshimoto said that earlier this year prosecutors and public defenders 
debated whether to join the UAW as a single bargaining unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teamsters Court Attorneys 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Teamsters have been courting both groups since 1978, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, we are a small organization of about 45 lawyers," Yoshimoto said. 
"We've been concerned for years because we are such a small group represented 
by our association, and we kind of get lost in the shuffle during the 
bargaining talks. 
</P>
<P>
"But then the question was asked, 'What do we as lawyers have to do with the 
UAW? What do we have in common?' " Yoshimoto asked. "But the UAW has a number 
of different organizations under their umbrella. There is a point to be made 
about solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
Crowle, the San Diego organizer, and Warshawsky, the Solano County public 
defender, said they see nothing wrong with being represented by unions that are 
more closely identified with blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely their blue-collar concerns that made us interested in them. We 
feel that their concerns, combined with our professional concerns, are a 
legitimate representation of our clients' needs," Crowle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties With Truckers 
</P>
<P>
Warshawsky, noting that public defenders usually represent poor defendants, 
said lawyers in his office never worried about "being lumped in with truck 
drivers" when they signed with the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorneys in this office feel there is a blue-collar essence to this 
place. . . . We see ourselves as county workers," Warshawsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Solano County represents the Teamsters' only victory in California in the 
union's drive to organize public-sector attorneys. The Teamsters succeeded in 
organizing about 36 public defenders and 40 deputy district attorneys into a 
single bargaining unit, where the UAW failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Teamsters are the labor organization as far as I'm concerned," Warshawsky 
said. "They're established and have strength. . . . The thing we didn't want to 
do is to go with a union that when push came to shove would tell us, 'We did 
our best. We're sorry.' We felt that the Teamsters by virtue of their strength 
were in a position to push back and back us realistically." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unions Target Public Sector 
</P>
<P>
Dan Mitchell, director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations, said that 
unions are looking for new members among professionals in the public sector 
because "that is a more fertile field." He noted that the UAW lost an important 
election in July at the Nissan automotive plant in Tennessee, where auto 
workers voted to keep the union out. 
</P>
<P>
"Unions have been doing poorly in the private sector, but have been more than 
holding their own in the public sector," Mitchell said. "If you're a union 
official, you tend to look to the public sector. The climate is more receptive 
there." 
</P>
<P>
He said that public-sector employees such as lawyers are becoming more and more 
receptive to unions because they are becoming increasingly concerned about 
working conditions and reductions in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Most studies that have compared the impact of unions in the private and public 
sectors show that unions have had a much bigger impact in the private sector," 
Mitchell said. "Working conditions are better, and pay and benefits are much 
larger in the private sector where unions have organized workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This may explain why the public sector is no longer as resistant to 
unionization."

ARTISTS OFFER STUDENTS A BRUSH WITH CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's largest privately funded effort to involve artists in public 
schools has kicked into high gear in San Diego. More than 80 county artists 
have been hired to stimulate children in the city district's 110 elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Through the $3.75-million largess of philanthropist Muriel Gluck, artists 
already are teaching at schools from Torrey Pines to Paradise Hills, using a 
variety of creative approaches for children -- designing murals, making masks, 
sketching from observation and experience -- all while showing how art relates 
to mathematics, problem solving, history and other disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
And even as individual schools and faculties eagerly await their own 
artists-in-residence, administrators are already thinking about how to sustain 
the renewed interest in fine arts beyond the multi-year Gluck grant. Teachers 
are being encouraged both to participate with students in the resident artists' 
projects and to consider how they can continue an enhanced curriculum once the 
artists are gone. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the schools program could heighten the visibility of many of the 
hundreds of San Diego County artists who design and draw in relative obscurity 
while supporting themselves through other full-time work. With almost $1 
million in salaries being dispensed to artists -- an average of $16,800 
annually for 20 hours of weekly work -- the grant provides some with their 
first steady payments in their profession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director Envisions a 'Paris of the West' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to keep all these artistic people in San Diego," vows Kay Wagner, 
fine-arts education director for the San Diego Unified School District and who 
oversees the Gluck Young At Art program. "I'd like to see San Diego become the 
'Paris of the West,' and we can help through making these artists better known 
in the community. . . . Art has the potential to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
Already, several artists have garnered attention both for the school and 
community where they have worked with major murals and sculptures intended to 
boost neighborhood and student self-esteem as well as improve the aesthetics of 
the physical plant, which at most schools are admittedly undistinguished. 
</P>
<P>
"What amazes me is how well things have worked so far without my having set 
down a lot of rules," Wagner said. "I've tried to have as few rules from the 
top as possible, to instead let the schools and the artists decide together how 
they want to proceed." Wagner's only stipulation is that she wants the artists 
not to function merely as teachers but to serve as role models and build upon 
the existing arts curriculum, however sparse in most schools. 
</P>
<P>
"And I've been pleased at the willingness of schools to allow artists to come 
in and share on that basis, because I guess I had the stereotype of schools as 
not being flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner strongly backs the "studio" approach to arts instruction, which argues 
that students learn best about art and its concepts by producing it. In 
contrast, other educators, in particular the Getty Center for Education of the 
Arts in Los Angeles, prefer the so-called discipline-based method of 
instruction, which emphasizes art history, art criticism and the study of great 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
While Wagner says there is room for both approaches, she and her artists 
believe that students, particularly at the elementary level, need hands-on 
experiences. Gluck reserved $1 million under her grant for the San Diego Museum 
of Art, which includes museum visits and a special traveling art trailer that 
tend more toward the discipline-based approach. 
</P>
<P>
For the resident artists, each school is proving a different environment, but 
the teachers at all sites have certain wish lists they hope the artists can 
fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Cindy Zimmerman said, "The schools want us to help improve skills of 
(regular) teachers, give them logistical help in showing how to set up supplies 
and deal with the mess of materials, and to show how art can build student 
self-esteem, serve as a tool for social change, help with the human spirit, all 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
Along with colleague Darcy Alexander, Zimmerman visits all the schools to 
explain the program and find out what teachers would like an artist to 
emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you can't expect artists to solve all the problems of the world," 
Zimmerman said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Felix has already shared her talent at four city schools, all of which 
she said presented different challenges. Students at Vista Grande Elementary, 
where many of the students have had some exposure to art through their parents, 
worked with Felix on making large-scale quilts. At Jackson and Encanto 
elementaries, both of which are heavily non-white, Felix carried out a variety 
of projects in different areas of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, everywhere I try to show how art is part of my life and how it can 
really be integrated into other things," Felix said. "We talk about what the 
world would be like without art, how art can serve as a social message through 
posters, how art is decorative at times, and functional at times. . . . I bring 
in paintings, baskets, African art, things that the kids can touch since so 
many have never touched any kind of art." 
</P>
<P>
At Sherman Elementary near downtown, Pamela Kozminska is part of a contingent 
working with students on ceramic tile designs that will then be molded into 
chairs and benches for the campus. The students draw word pictures, designs and 
games after envisioning how they would look as part of street furniture to sit 
on or lean against. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we asked students if they would like to draw or write pictures to go 
on the (ceramic) wall," Kozminska said. "The natural drawers volunteered right 
away, and with others we had to ask them several times, or encourage them to go 
beyond simple geometric shapes to something more personal, and some got real 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of her colleagues, Kozminska wants the concept of art considered in 
the broadest strokes possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I stress the holistic aspect to art, that pattern is math, that jokes and puns 
and writing can be part of word games or a picture image, that art connects 
with environmental issues like clean water, which they are going to deal with 
as adults." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the artists have found teachers more than willing to partake 
of their lessons as well. 
</P>
<P>
David Beck Brown, a sculptor who specializes in public art, said most artists 
stress the need for teachers to participate with their students. Felix compiled 
all of her lesson plans from Encanto into a booklet for the teachers to use. 
</P>
<P>
"The artist-in-residence is here not only to give art experience to the student 
but the teacher as well," said Carson Elementary Principal John Sullivan, who 
hopes for a "dynamite art show" for parents and students in November as a 
result of student projects with the school's artist. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to videotape all the lessons," Sullivan said. "Our teachers get 
some art training in their teacher preparation, but they have nine other 
subjects a day to teach. And let's face it, art has been put on the back burner 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Zamorano Elementary, the 4-year-old arts magnet school in South Bay 
Terrace, say resident artists can be helpful even to those like themselves who 
have some specialized art training. 
</P>
<P>
"They share with us a lot and they are not set apart," Tony Dowling said. "In 
most ways, they become part of the faculty, . . . and no matter your expertise, 
the resident artists take some of the pressure off. And no matter how much 
background you have in art, you still can learn new things." 
</P>
<P>
Added Dowling's colleague, Pamela Stahlak: "Even someone with no experience and 
great fear of teaching art" can pick up basic skills from watching a half-dozen 
demonstrations by an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"As teachers, we're all in this business to learn as well as provide for our 
students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant schools Supt. Catherine Hopper, aware that the Gluck donation will 
not last forever, wants schools to begin thinking now of ways to continue a 
strengthened program long after the resident artists leave. The district's 
restructuring reforms, which allow individual schools to create their own 
curriculums and methodologies -- within limits -- provide that opportunity, 
Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
"An individual school can set up its own priorities if it believes art is 
important," Hopper said. "They can teach classes in different sizes and 
clusters." 
</P>
<P>
Already, one or two teachers at certain schools have agreed to become art 
specialists, taking students from two or more classes several times a week for 
art instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"All the answers aren't going to be addressed with more and more money," Hopper 
said. "The positive feedback so far from the resident-artists program has to be 
channeled or otherwise things will eventually die."

NEW LIGHT ON THE 'FREE RADICALS' THAT CAUSE AGING.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Prometheus stole the flame of eternal life, the enraged Gods banished him 
from Olympus. This robbed him of immortality and condemned humanity to death. 
Now scientists on the cutting edge of longevity research have discovered that 
the spiritual duality that inspired this Greek myth -- the sustaining life 
force is ultimately lethal -- is rooted in reality. When we breathe oxygen, it 
creates highly reactive free radical molecules that go on a deadly rampage 
throughout our bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate paradox: oxygen is essential for life yet it forms 
substances that may be killing us," says Paul Hochstein, director of the 
Institute for Toxicology at the USC School of Pharmacy. The Institute, which 
was founded in 1980, is one of the few centers in the world devoted solely to 
the study of free radicals. 
</P>
<P>
What scientists are learning here and at other research facilities about free 
radicals sheds new light on the understanding of the mechanisms of aging, and 
about many of the debilitating illnesses that accompany aging. This knowledge 
may eventually yield therapies to maximize lifespan and to maintain full mental 
and physical capabilities well into old age, according to some researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Free radical reactions contribute directly to the physical ravages of age. The 
oxidative damage caused by free radicals "rusts" cells in much the same way as 
oxygen erodes metal, and gradually wears down our bodily organs. These volatile 
molecules may even be the key agents in hastening aging because they break down 
or alter DNA, the master regulator of the cell. 
</P>
<P>
This also upsets the body's delicate chemical balance and weakens our immune 
system so that we are more susceptible to disease. Free radicals are believed 
to play a major role in causing or aggravating more than 60 of the afflictions 
associated with aging, including cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, 
rheumatoid arthritis, cataracts, glaucoma, emphysema, Parkinson's disease and 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Free radicals are a by-product of our normal metabolism, though some are 
created by radiation, ozone exposure, cancer-causing chemicals and other 
environmental toxins. These free radicals form briefly when oxygen courses 
through the body and has a chemical reaction with the cells. Free radicals 
cruise through our bodies searching for an electron mate, like heat-seeking 
missiles. When they link up with another molecule, that molecule suddenly has 
an extra electron. To restore its electrical balance, the molecule latches onto 
yet another molecule. This process triggers a toxic chain reaction that wreaks 
havoc at that site in the body. Cells are destroyed or severely damaged, and 
genes are chewed up or reprogrammed. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneering scientists are now looking for ways to delay, prevent or even 
reverse the physical deterioration that's triggered by these renegade 
molecules. For example, Kelvin Davies, an associate professor at USC and a 
member of the faculty at the Institute, believes that eventually we will be 
able to mobilize the body's natural defenses to halt the degeneration triggered 
by free radicals. 
</P>
<P>
The British-born biochemist has discovered a class of enzymes that are 
programmed to repair damage caused by free radical reactions. Davies postulated 
the existence of genes that coded for these enzymes based on his observation of 
oxidative damage to cell cultures bombarded with hydrogen peroxide (an unstable 
oxygen molecule). "We hit these cells with lethal doses of hydrogen peroxide 
but it didn't kill them off. So the cells must have some way of removing or 
repairing damage." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out they do. Some of the body's enzymes function as a repair system 
to fix the damage done by free radicals. Davies discovered one set of enzymes, 
macroxyprotheinase (MOP), salvages injured proteins. Another class of enzymes, 
phopholipases, performs a similar function with cell membranes, while yet a 
third group, nucleases and glycosylases, actually repair the DNA. Initially, 
cells are able to combat this bombardment. "But the cumulative effects of this 
damage over time may diminish the cell's ability to make these repairs," says 
Davies. "This may be what causes some of the physical degeneration of aging." 
In other words, our bodies are ground down from wear and tear, and all the 
debris that collects in our system. 
</P>
<P>
This discovery provides some intriguing clues into the aging process: it may be 
that the reason some people live to a vital old age is because their internal 
salvage system retains its vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also investigating the role free radicals play in disturbing 
the normal regulatory function of the DNA. Some researchers have found free 
radicals do damage to the DNA, which inhibits the production of the enzyme 
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). This enzyme provides fuel for cellular activity. 
The DNA damage also triggers the activation of an enzyme -- Poly-ADP Rebose 
Polymerase -- that might enhance the formation of malignant tumors in cells. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also uncovered a number of natural substances that counteract 
the damage spawned by free radical reactions. The food preservative BHT, and 
common nutrients like selenium, vitamins, A, C, and E, and beta-carotene, have 
been shown to be antioxidants; anti-oxidants disarm free radicals by 
scooping-up their extra electrons before renegade molecules can cause trouble. 
Our bodies also produce enzymes, like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, 
gluthathione peroxidase and DT diaphrorase, that neutralize free radicals by 
converting them to harmless chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Studies are now in progress to test the disease-fighting potential of these 
free radical inhibitors. The National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Disorders and Stroke, for instance, has funded a $10-million 
study to see if vitamin E and deprenyl, a drug that inhibits the formation of 
free radicals, can stem the loss of brain cells in 800 patients who are in the 
early stages of Parkinson's disease. "Based upon previous data," explains 
Gerald Cohen, a professor of neurology at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in 
New York and a member of the scientific advisory committee for the Parkinson's 
study, "these two agents used in combination hold out the promise of stopping 
the progression of this crippling disorder." 
</P>
<P>
Free radical research is also broadening scientists' comprehension of the link 
between cholesterol -- specifically, the "bad" cholesterol known as low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) -- and another major killer, atherosclerosis. "Studies show 
that if LDL is modified by free radicals -- forming a toxic substance called 
cholesterol epoxide -- this altered LDL is much more readily deposited in the 
cell walls," explains Alex Sevanian, an associate professor at USC and a member 
of the faculty at the Institute. "The accumulation of these fat-filled cells in 
the walls of the arteries is one of the hallmarks of the early stages of 
atherosclerosis."

In a recent experiment that Sevanian conducted in tandem with Judy Berliner, a 
biochemist at UCLA, LDL was deliberately enriched with cholesterol apoxide. 
Sure enough, the transformed LDL penetrated cell membranes like a knife slicing 
through warm butter. "The cause-effect relationship is very compelling," says 
Sevanian. "This free radical reaction may be pivotal in causing 
atherosclerosis, as well as increasing the risk of high blood pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Free radicals may also be the culprits behind much of the damage that 
accompanies heart attacks and strokes. Numerous studies reveal that when blood 
flow to the heart -- or to other vital organs like the brain, lungs and kidneys 
-- is temporarily stopped, the real destruction occurs after the blood flow has 
been resumed. That's because the rush of oxygen fuels the formation of free 
radicals. 
</P>
<P>
Hochstein and his colleagues have found that when oxygen flow is restored to 
the heart, the free radicals transform oxygen into hydrogen peroxide. Then the 
hydrogen peroxide converts myoglobin -- which normally transports oxygen to the 
muscles -- into a "toxic enzyme-like substance that damages the heart," 
explains Hochstein. "Not all the damage sustained during a heart attack can be 
attributed to free radical reactions. But they are a key element." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are monitoring the effectiveness of antioxidants such as 
beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E to combat cancer. "We found that smokers 
who eat leafy green vegetables" -- which are rich in vitamin A and C -- 
"develop lung cancer less often than those who don't," says William Pryor, a 
professor of biochemistry at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and a 
pioneer in the study of free radicals. "It's conceivable smokers could benefit 
from an antioxidant supplementation regimen." 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists are investigating the therapeutic possibilities of using 
vitamin C to reverse the damage by sunlight and oxygen that makes our eyes more 
vulnerable to the formation of cataracts. And still others are employing 
antiradical agents to halt the neurological damage triggered by oxygen radicals 
after strokes or injuries to the head and spinal cord, and to curb tissue 
damage in such diseases as emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a renaissance in free radical biology in the past decade," says 
Pryor. "Within the next 10 or so years, (we) will promote a modest extension in 
lifespan -- perhaps five to eight years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The " Free Radical " 
</P>
<P>
1. Oxygen molecules enter the body through eating or breathing. 
</P>
<P>
2. In normal metabolism, molecule becomes unstable by losing one of its 
electrons to another molecule. Unstable molecule known as "free radical." 
</P>
<P>
3. "Free radical" latches onto another molecule in the membrane of a cell. 
Molecule travels off and leaves cell with its own "free radical." 
</P>
<P>
4. After cell membrane has been broken by the chain of "free radical" 
exchanges, cell begins to disintegrate. This damages the genes and can destroy 
the cell.

An experimental drug narrowly outperforms aspirin in preventing strokes in 
high-risk patients, New York University researchers reported last week in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. The drug, ticlopidine, "was found to be 
somewhat more effective than aspirin in reducing the risk of death" in patients 
with early warning signs of stroke, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the drug was found to benefit women as well as men. Earlier 
research had documented aspirin's ability to prevent strokes in men but was 
inconclusive in women. The study, led by Dr. William K. Hass, looked at more 
than 3,000 patients with early warning signs of stroke over six years. Roughly 
half were given aspirin and half ticlopidine. In the group taking ticlopidine, 
there were 172 strokes and 306 deaths, compared to 212 strokes and 349 deaths 
in the group taking aspirin. Those taking ticlopidine experienced more side 
effects, however, including diarrhea, rash, elevated cholesterol levels and 
reduced white blood cell counts. 
</P>
<P>
Although ticlopidine's ability to prevent strokes is not clearly understood by 
scientists, aspirin works by thinning the blood, discouraging the formation of 
clots in arteries leading to the brain.

SMOG AND THE RISE IN ASTHMA

<P>
The incidence of asthma is rising dramatically in the United States and 
pollution is a major reason, researchers reported last week in a large 
nationwide study. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the number of office visits to physicians for asthma 
is increasing tremendously," said Claude Lenfant, director of the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. "We are faced with a tremendous health 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the study, the largest of its kind, nearly half of the pediatricians 
surveyed said they are treating more asthmatic children today than they were 
five or 10 years ago. Nearly 30% of these doctors said they are now treating 
more than 10 asthma patients per week. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution was cited as the major reason for the increase in asthma, and nearly 
half of the parents of asthmatic children felt their children suffered 
emotionally from the condition. Many of the parents also viewed their child's 
condition as life-threatening.

CAN ANYONE SPARE A DIME FOR THE FUTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN BROWN, Kathleen Brown is a public finance attorney and former 
Commissioner of Public Works for the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, a majority of Californians took greater personal responsibility for 
their wastes. Water came from a local well. Sewage went into a back-yard septic 
tank and trash was burned in an incinerator or hauled to a local dump at the 
edge of town. Today, a rapidly expanding population, economic growth and 
environmental concerns have made these essential operations a vital element of 
government services. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a growing number of California cities have failed to invest in 
their infrastructure needs. Without immediate attention, the consequences will 
profoundly affect our quality of life for generations. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the Governor's Task Force on Infrastructure projected a 10-year 
public works deficit of more than $50 billion. That gap has only grown in the 
ensuing years. Our Golden State has a huge bill coming due for the neglect of 
sewer systems and trash facilities. Roads, bridges, water-delivery systems and 
municipal facilities are similarly in need of attention. 
</P>
<P>
How big an issue is it? A few statistics from the city of Los Angeles 
illustrate the problems statewide. First, the sewers. By midnight tonight, more 
than 440 million gallons of waste water will have passed through about 6,000 
miles of Los Angeles' antiquated sewer system. Voters in the 1970s and early 
'80s routinely voted down sewer-bond measures. The relationship between an 
aging sewer system and the pollution of Santa Monica Bay was not grasped. With 
time and the tolerance of the bay running down, the city finally made a 
commitment to modernize its sewer system and, in so doing, to clean up the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The city has embarked on a $3.4-billion sewer improvement program that will 
result in a state-of-the-art waste-water facility. And, in November, 1987, Los 
Angeles stopped dumping sludge, the solid remains from sewage, into the bay 
waters off our coastline. Although the costs are enormous, Los Angeles is in 
fact playing an expensive and high-stakes game of catch-up for failing to 
support earlier efforts to upgrade its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
With its capital improvement program in place, Los Angeles is fundamentally on 
track with its sewer system. However, the city is in much poorer shape with 
respect to solid waste -- the stuff we put in garbage cans. We must address 
this issue today and not wait for a California version of the now-symbolic 
"Mobro" barge that cruised the East Coast in search of a site to unload its 
cargo of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Greater Los Angeles generates more than 14 million tons of trash every year 
that has to go somewhere both out of sight and environmentally safe. Meanwhile, 
we're running out of places to put it. In less than five years, the city-owned 
landfill will be filled to the top. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term solution to our trash problems requires a major commitment from 
the public and private sectors to reduce the amount of material going into the 
waste stream in order to relieve the pressure on our limited landfill reserves. 
Next, we must recover valuable natural resources by recycling. Market 
incentives are also needed for products using recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of public works investment is substantial, but so is the cost of 
underinvestment. Thus, while there are many needs and never enough money, 
public officials must inform the public shareholders in our municipal 
corporation of the depreciation of their infrastructure assets. Investment in 
these essential facilities is as much a state responsibility as a local concern 
because of their importance to our economic vitality and quality of life. 
Leadership in Sacramento is needed. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, we must initiate, at the state level, a comprehensive, 
multi-year capital outlay planning process for each infrastructure element to 
meet California needs. Next, innovative financing mechanisms to assist local 
governments in financing capital needs should be explored. For example, the 
state could aggressively pursue "bond pooling," in which the small bond issues 
of local governmental entities are assembled into larger issues. This strategy 
improves marketability and reduces costs for local issuers. 
</P>
<P>
Through appropriate legislation, the state could selectively insure public 
infrastructure debt through an independent insurance fund supported by premiums 
charged to participating entities. This would lower the interest cost to 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to ensure that state and local governments can finance vital projects 
like schools, roads, prisons and water facilities for their citizens at the 
lowest possible cost, tax-exempt bonds must be protected. Nationally, the 
Public Securities Assn. estimates that $27.5 billion in additional costs to 
local taxpayers would result if this exemption were lost. California should 
join the growing number of states that have endorsed an amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution to keep Congress from taxing these bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If California's basic transportation, water supply and waste disposal systems 
continue to deteriorate, the state's vibrant economy, as well as its heralded 
quality of life, will erode. We must maintain a continuing investment in our 
public infrastructure. Today's headlines that describe collapsing sewer pipes, 
gridlocked roads and trash with nowhere to go are a consequence of our failure 
to provide for California's future. It is up to our leaders to tell us the 
facts and the costs. Today's investment is tomorrow's quality of life.

TROUBLE IN AVALON; 
</P>

BUT PLANS AFOOT TO HELP WITH CROWDS, HOUSING

AVALON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By boat, the view approaching this tourist town presents a trio of vivid 
images, each rising from the morning mists like a post card come to life. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Hamilton Cove condominiums emerge on the horizon, tier upon tier of 
gleaming white buildings hewn into a hillside of the rugged Santa Catalina 
Island terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the landmark Casino Ballroom, a round, domed Art Deco-style structure, 
comes into view, perched on a showy vantage point of land jutting into the blue 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, rounding the curve into Avalon Bay, the town itself unfolds, exuding 
Old World charm and a Mediterranean-like ambiance. Picturesque houses with 
red-tiled roofs line the steep, winding streets, overlooking a white sand beach 
and a boat-filled harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Once ashore, Avalon lives up to its idyllic image. 
</P>
<P>
It is a town where many residents are on a first-name basis and where 
townspeople pick up their mail at the post office because there are too few 
addresses to justify the expense of home mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Crescent Avenue, a pedestrian mall of souvenir shops and restaurants with 
quaint names like Buoys and Gulls and the Busy Bee, retains a small-town 
flavor, though year-round residents tend to avoid it in summer months because 
of the throngs of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
But even in picture-perfect Avalon, there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
In surveys conducted over the last year by the Santa Catalina Island Co., 
residents and visitors alike identified a number of ways that life in Avalon 
could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the city of about 2,500 is bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon suffers from a shortage of housing for permanent residents, and would-be 
workers in the year-round tourist industry often have trouble finding a place 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion and a lack of parking spaces are critical issues. Even 
though many residents tool around the hilly streets in space-saving golf carts, 
and the city strictly limits the numbers of cars and other vehicles, summer 
traffic often collects in bottlenecks at downtown intersections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Overtown" Tourists 
</P>
<P>
For residents, tourism is both an economic boon and a hindrance of day-to-day 
life. As many as 15,000 tourists from "overtown," as the mainland is called, 
flood the 1.25-square-mile town daily, providing big profits for Avalon 
merchants but straining the town's already taxed fresh-water resources, streets 
and sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Twice weekly, the tourist tide swells when cruise ships are moored offshore and 
hundreds of vacationers are ferried to the Pleasure Pier for a few hurried 
hours of sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Avalon resident John W. R. Windle, who arrived on the island as a 
6-year-old in 1910, reveres Avalon's small-town charms but says the city's 
growth and its increasing popularity as a year-round tourist attraction cause 
headaches for permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things need fixing, there's no doubt about it," said Windle, 85. "And 
it's getting more commercial, it really is. Sometimes, I get to feel like a 
stranger in my own town." 
</P>
<P>
To ease the problems, officials at the Santa Catalina Island Co. have unveiled 
a sweeping, 15-year plan aimed at redeveloping much of Avalon in three-year 
phases. 
</P>
<P>
The plan -- still at a conceptual stage -- is intended to address some of the 
most pressing issues facing Avalon, including lack of year-round housing and a 
water supply so limited that saltwater is used to flush toilets and to douse 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes new moderate-cost apartments and homes for year-round 
residents, a new transportation center to consolidate ticket-buying and other 
travel functions now spread over the town, a desalination plant, three new 
hotels with a total of about 200 new rooms, and a general sprucing-up of 
Avalon's streets and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Island officials are uncertain how much it will cost to implement the plan and 
how any future development costs will be divided among the island company, the 
city and private developers. A desalination plant that purifies water will 
alone cost roughly $3 million, officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, while acknowledging that the changes are overdue, say they want 
to preserve Avalon's small-town quality. 
</P>
<P>
Therein, island company officials say, lies a major dilemma: how to upgrade 
Avalon without altering its charm. 
</P>
<P>
"Avalon's now 75 years old, and a lot of the things that were convenient and 
appropriate 75 years ago are no longer convenient and appropriate," said island 
company vice president Ron Doutt. "They are, as a matter of fact, contributing 
to these problems." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Catalina Island was purchased in 1919 by the family of chewing gum 
magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the island company. The company now owns 
about two-thirds of the land in Avalon and about 20% of the city's buildings. 
In 1975, the company deeded about 86% of the island to the nonprofit Catalina 
Conservancy, which maintains the pristine interior. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Avalon's buildings -- such as City Hall, a wood frame, stucco-covered 
structure built around 1917 into a steep hillside -- date from the early part 
of the century. Office space at City Hall, for example, is so limited that some 
city workers share desks in the council chambers, which holds a maximum of 36 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Space is at an even greater premium at the Avalon fire station, across from 
City Hall on Metropole Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's unbelievable," said Fire Chief Jack Goslin. "We don't even have a 
ramp to pull out the trucks and work on them." During daily maintenance checks, 
the trucks must be pulled out onto Metropole, partially blocking the 
thoroughfare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A new fire station -- proposed for a site on Avalon Canyon Road near the school 
and Avalon Municipal Hospital -- could provide training space for the 
department's 25 volunteer firefighters, Goslin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see it done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents have expressed dismay that the plans will take 15 years to 
complete. "It's not fast enough," one resident wrote on an island company 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith called the plan "workable and doable" and said he 
supports the island company's plan to proceed "a step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Island company officials say developing the project over 15 years will minimize 
disruption to Avalon's tourists and residents. The plans call for: 
</P>
<P>
* Building 50 units of housing a year over 15 years. The additional housing is 
planned for three locations: Las Casitas, the site of a former bungalow-style 
hotel where the Chicago Cubs held spring training until 1951, now used as 
housing for island company employees; Bird Park Canyon, the site of a former 
aviary, once the home of a private collection of exotic birds, and Quail 
Canyon, on the outskirts of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
* Building a civic center, including a new City Hall, fire station and day-care 
facilities, on part of the 7-acre Las Casitas site. 
</P>
<P>
* Building a desalination plant near the Southern California Edison power plant 
on Pebbly Beach Road to provide a source of fresh water for new homes and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
* Building three hotels, including a high-quality hotel and public-access beach 
at Descanso Bay, a 16-acre site between the Casino Ballroom and the Hamilton 
Cove condominium development. A second hotel would be built near a city park at 
the western end of Crescent Avenue, the town's main street. Also, the Atwater 
Hotel would be razed to make room for a new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
* Making land owned by the island company available for lease and eventual 
purchase by permanent residents to build single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishing a central commercial area for residents, to include a new 
15,000-square-foot grocery store and a new post office, providing a place for 
residents to shop and check their mail away from the onslaught of visitors on 
tourist-crammed Crescent Avenue. Nearby would be a "transportation hub," where 
tourists would validate cross-channel transportation tickets, check in baggage 
and purchase tickets for tours into the interior. Such arrangements are now 
done at various locations, including Cabrillo Mole on Pebbly Beach Road and the 
Island Plaza on Sumner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing traffic by relocating many service-oriented businesses away from 
tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Sprucing up the city's parks, possibly adding landscaping along Sumner and 
Metropole avenues, based on the same architectural theme as the pedestrian mall 
on Crescent Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Island company officials said it is difficult to estimate how much the new 
developments could bring the city in revenue from hotel and business taxes, but 
one official ventured a rough estimate of about $1.7 million annually. Avalon's 
current annual budget is about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of the plan have been in the works for at least 20 years, said 
lifelong Avalon resident Malcolm Renton, a retired vice president of the island 
company. 
</P>
<P>
For example, building a grand hotel at Descanso Beach has been the company's 
goal since the St. Catherine Hotel, an elegant structure where Clark Gable, 
Mary Pickford, Cecil B. De Mille and other Hollywood stars once stayed, was 
razed in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was always to keep that a choice hotel location," said Renton, 81, 
whose father also worked for the island company. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the island company presented conceptual plans to residents at a town 
meeting, and reaction was mostly favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Of 67 residents who responded to an island company survey after the 
presentation, 25 residents, or about 41%, unconditionally approved the overall 
concept. Only two residents didn't like the plan. More meetings are planned 
over the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, residents seem confident that the plan will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful set-up," said Lolo Saldana, owner of Lolo's Plaza Barber Shop 
on Sumner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely impressed with it," said Lita Mulvihill, an Avalon resident for 
17 years, who said the plan "is renovating and restoring and bringing things 
back to life that used to be, like the old St. Catherine." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber is unlikely to take a formal position on the island company plans. But 
Griffin said he approves of the plans and the island company's solicitation of 
response from the town. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was great," Griffin said. "They're being very up-front about what 
they're doing and asking people what they think. It's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Moore, director and curator of the Catalina Island Museum, said the 
timing couldn't be better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our town needs to take a good hard look at ourselves because we're 
outgrowing ourselves," she said. "I think we're due for an uplift."

COUNCIL TO VOTE ON THEFT-FIGHTING CAR DECALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot program to deter car thefts, in which police could stop any vehicle 
with a special decal on its windshield during early morning hours, will be 
tested in the Van Nuys area if approved by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is based on New York City's Combat Auto Theft, or CAT, program, in 
which car owners sign waivers allowing police to stop their vehicles if spotted 
on streets between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., a period when most auto thefts occur in 
that city. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the two-year, 
$12,000 program for the Van Nuys area, where nearly 400 cars are stolen each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
New York authorities have praised the 3-year-old program, and a Los Angeles 
Police Department study concludes that a similar project here could deter car 
thefts and improve relations between police and the community. But the program 
probably would not lead to the capture of many car thieves, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Most car thefts in Los Angeles occur between 3 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., the report 
says, so the program's chief impact probably would be as a deterrent. "It could 
cause a vehicle thief to bypass a vehicle with a CAT decal and move on to a 
vehicle without a CAT decal," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
"If it deters car thefts, or if we can snag some hot cars off the streets, then 
it is going to be a winner," said Sgt. Bob Shallenberger, who will coordinate 
the pilot project if it is approved. "That's why we want to test it." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the program would work as follows: 
</P>
<P>
A car owner who wishes to participate would go to the department's Van Nuys 
station and sign a consent form allowing police to stop the car if it is seen 
on the road between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. After signing the form, the owner would 
receive a reflective windshield decal with an identifying serial number. The 
decal would alert officers to stop the vehicle if it is seen on the road during 
program hours. 
</P>
<P>
A sample consent form in the Los Angeles proposal reads: "Should any 
law-enforcement officer observe my vehicle being operated between 1 a.m. and 5 
a.m., they should reasonably suspect that the person operating my vehicle is 
doing so without my permission, and I hereby request that they stop my vehicle 
for further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Police caution that car owners should only participate in the program if they 
do not normally drive their cars during the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not for everybody," said Officer Raymond Swieczkowski, program 
coordinator for the New York Police Department. "It is only for a certain 
segment of society." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police designed the pilot project after it was proposed last year 
by Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who learned of the New York program while 
listening to a radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernardi made the proposal, police expressed concerns about the legality 
of allowing car owners to waive what, in effect, is their protection against 
unreasonable search and seizure, as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the 
U. S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles city attorney's office said in a report on the program that 
no legal precedent was found prohibiting vehicle owners from granting police 
authorization to stop cars at specific times to determine if they are stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Swieczkowski said that the legality of the New York program never has been 
challenged, and that the decal gives police probable cause to stop a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Davidson, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in Los 
Angeles, said that because car owners voluntarily join the program, there is 
nothing unconstitutional about it. However, he said a challenge could arise if 
police stopped a car with a decal that was being lawfully driven by someone 
other than its owner. 
</P>
<P>
"One person does not have a right to waive another person's constitutional 
rights," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council approves the program, it will start within two months, 
after the decals are printed and a public information campaign is staged in the 
Van Nuys area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys Division was chosen as the test area because it was the only one 
of 18 police divisions that ranked in the top four in both of two studies: the 
number of cars stolen last year -- 4,659 -- and in the percentage increase of 
car thefts between 1987 and 1988 -- 25.2%. The division includes Van Nuys, 
Sherman Oaks, Panorama City and parts of Sepulveda and Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Swieczkowski said New York's program has been expanded from two Queens 
precincts in 1986 to 45 precincts -- more than half of the city. He said 31,838 
cars had been equipped with decals by June. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, 52 cars in the program have been stolen. Swieczkowski called that 
figure extremely low and said it supports his department's contention that the 
primary advantage of the system is to deter car thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is one car with one of these stickers and one without it, which one 
will a thief steal?" Swieczkowski asked.

QUESTIONS RAISED OVER GRANTING OF COMPUTER ACCESS TO BANE'S WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Tarzana Assemblyman Tom Bane has been granted a privilege 
ordinarily reserved for lawmakers and their staffs: her own terminal and file 
in the Assembly's taxpayer-financed computer system, according to the Assembly 
Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
With authority to use the state computer, Marlene Bane, a top Democratic 
fund-raiser not on the Assembly payroll, can correspond electronically with 
Assembly members, write memos and research legislation and constituent 
complaints as if she were an employee or lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly Rules Committee, 
said she was given the authority earlier this year at the request of her 
husband's office. He said she may be the only legislative spouse authorized to 
tap into the computer's data bank, although several other relatives of 
lawmakers could also have access to the system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Software Controversy 
</P>
<P>
"It really isn't that big a deal," Connelly said, adding that 15 to 20 unpaid 
volunteer staffers or Assembly interns also have computer accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a controversy erupted about Marlene Bane's interest in Data 
Plus Imagination of Van Nuys because her husband was urging the Assembly to 
purchase its software. She reported selling her stake in the firm to avoid a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Now, two Republican assemblymen have questioned her use of the computer. 
Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy of Monrovia, a critic of the Assembly's 
computer system, said: "I don't know why she would be privileged to have 
access" to the system, maintaining that the arrangement looks bad. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach said that if Marlene Bane is merely 
helping her husband respond to constituent problems, she probably is not acting 
improperly. Ferguson cautioned that to use the Assembly computer "for fund 
raising would be illegal, as well as plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Bane has emerged in recent years as a major fund-raiser for her 
husband, a veteran Democratic lawmaker, and for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco). With an aggressive team of solicitors, she has funneled 
millions of dollars to Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scoffed at Criticism 
</P>
<P>
But her husband, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, scoffed at the 
criticism of his wife, maintaining that she uses the computer only for 
legislative affairs. "What else would we use it for?" Bane asked in an 
interview. "If there was anything improper about it, we wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bane called the services performed by his wife, who has a cubbyhole office 
inside his Capitol office, a bargain for taxpayers. As an unpaid staffer, Bane 
said, his wife "takes better care of my constituents . . . than anyone else 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Bane declined to allow his wife to be interviewed, insisting that "her opinions 
and mine are the same." 
</P>
<P>
Further minimizing Marlene Bane's access to the computer, Connelly said "it's 
just a matter of time" before the public will also have access to some of the 
material in the Assembly computer. He stressed that Marlene Bane must abide by 
regulations that prohibit Assembly employees from using the system for 
political or personal business. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Bane first attracted attention as a political mover and shaker in 1986, 
when a dispute erupted over her ties to the firm that was marketing computer 
software which her husband was urging Assembly members to buy as a means of 
responding to constituent inquiries and mail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elaborate Index 
</P>
<P>
The software grew out of an elaborate card file index that Marlene Bane 
developed to track the reason each constituent contacted her husband's office. 
A former Bane staffer said the idea was to put letters bearing the 
assemblyman's name in constituents' mailboxes. "Even routine problems would 
generate five or six letters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Banes and Mike P. Shulem created Data Plus Imagination, which developed a 
computerized version of the card file system. In part to avoid conflict of 
interest, Marlene Bane sold her 25% stake in the firm for $1,700 to Shulem. Her 
husband has said he insisted on the $1,700 price tag "because I didn't want 
anybody questioning whether or not there was a profit made on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Later, another Shulem-controlled firm -- Monarch Constituent Services of Van 
Nuys -- was among half a dozen successful bidders for Assembly software 
contracts. Monarch has an increasingly large share of the Assembly software 
market -- more than half of the Assembly's 80 members. In the past two years, 
the Assembly has spent at least $1.3 million for computer software, including 
$567,000 paid to Monarch. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Marlene Bane has remained active as a consultant on computer 
issues, prompting some legislative sources to wonder whether she still has a 
stake, personal or financial, in the success of Shulem's software. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Her Out 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, in the past year, state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville) 
and the staff of state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) have sought out Marlene 
Bane to discuss how to use software to respond to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Mello said that from his perspective, "she was probably the most knowledgeable 
person" about software. "She really did me a favor. We talked for about two 
hours" about software and how it is put together, Mello said of his meeting 
with Marlene Bane. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two legislative sources familiar with the Assembly computer system 
say she participated last spring in at least two private meetings at which 
problems with Monarch's software were raised. 
</P>
<P>
Bane acknowledged that his wife took part in one session in which complaints 
about the computer system were discussed. He said Assembly computer users 
talked about problems at the meeting, which he believes Shulem also attended. 
"We had problems with 
</P>
<P>
our system, and she came in and explained the problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountjoy said he is unaware of any Republicans present at the meeting. "We're 
not invited to those. . . . We, as the minority party, are working in the 
dark." 
</P>
<P>
Mountjoy said Marlene Bane's access to the Assembly's computer underscores her 
role as one of the most influential legislative spouses. As one lobbyist put it 
two years ago, "She gets the power of an assemblyman without having to be 
elected." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, she has drawn attention to herself as chairwoman of a state 
health panel that awards state research grants on lupus, a debilitating and 
potentially fatal autoimmune disease. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, his wife and other members of the state lupus board are being sued by a 
coalition of lupus support groups which are charging that more than $1 million 
in state funds appropriated for research has been illegally diverted to 
non-lupus projects. At the same time, the state attorney general's office has 
been auditing allocations by the lupus board and by a nonprofit lupus 
foundation run by Bane.

NINE BANKS DYNAMITED IN COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG CARTEL BLAMED; MINISTER OF JUSTICE REPORTEDLY RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a campaign of terror by Colombian cocaine barons, bombs exploded Sunday at 
nine banks -- one of the blasts killing a university student -- and radio 
stations reported the resignation of a key Cabinet official in President 
Virgilio Barco Vargas' war against the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The reports that Justice Minister Monica de Greiff had quit her job appeared to 
signal weakness in the Cabinet at a time when Barco has called for national 
unity and determination to fight the powerful and violent drug bosses. 
</P>
<P>
A written statement from the president's office quoted Barco as saying: "I have 
not thought about, nor is there reason for, a crisis in the Cabinet. It is 
something I have not considered now nor for the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resignation Not Ruled Out 
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Barco "denied information related to the resignation of 
Justice Minister . . . De Greiff" but did not specifically rule out her 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Seven dynamite bombs exploded before dawn at Banco Cafetero branches in 
Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city and headquarters of the country's most 
notorious cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, bombs went off at two private bank branches in Medellin, the 
Todelar radio network reported. It said that Jairo Montoya, a 21-year-old 
student, was killed in the explosion at the Banco de Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the other bombings. All were regarded as a further 
attempt by the drug barons to intimidate the country's political and business 
power structure. 
</P>
<P>
The Banco Cafetero is a government bank that provides financial support for the 
coffee business, Colombia's top legal earner of export income. 
</P>
<P>
A group called "The Extraditables," known to include leaders of the Medellin 
drug cartel, announced in a manifesto last Thursday that it was declaring 
"total and absolute war" on the government, big businessmen and others who 
oppose the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Bombs set the same day the manifesto was issued destroyed Medellin offices of 
the country's two main political parties, and the country homes of two 
prominent politicians were burned. 
</P>
<P>
Those bombs and the manifesto came six days after President Barco announced 
decrees permitting the government to extradite accused drug traffickers to the 
United States for trial and to seize their properties in Colombia. Since then, 
the government has conducted more than a thousand anti-narcotics raids, 
detained thousands of people and seized hundreds of farms, ranches and urban 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombs, but drug traffickers are 
suspected, police said. Four bombs that did not explode were found at other 
Medellin branches of the Banco Cafetero, and another was found at a private 
bank. Two men were arrested with 88 pounds of dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Banco Cafetero said the bombs appeared to be a response by 
traffickers to the government drive against them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the war that Barco announced," said Sergio Soto, manager of 
one of the bombed branches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Foundation of Economy' 
</P>
<P>
"Coffee is the foundation of the Colombian economy, and there is a declared war 
against public and private interests," said Juan Maria Cock, the bank's 
regional president in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
The traffickers also have made death threats to numerous judges, officials and 
journalists in recent days. Justice Minister De Greiff was reported to have 
received telephone threats last week against herself and her family, and the 
news agency Colprensa said intelligence agents had discovered a plot against 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
She left Friday for Washington, where she was scheduled to hold talks with 
American officials on U.S. anti-narcotics aid. A Colombian official said the 
minister, who traveled with her husband and 3-year-old son, is not expected to 
return to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday afternoon, the Radio Todelar network reported that De Greiff had 
"resigned in a telephone call to President Barco in recent hours due to a 
series of threats against her life, and accepting the advice of politicians who 
recommended that in this moment there should be a person of more experience in 
this job." 
</P>
<P>
De Greiff, 32, previously had held no Cabinet position, although she had been 
vice minister of justice. She is the sixth justice minister appointed since 
Barco took office in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Attacks 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, assassins believed to be working for drug traffickers killed Justice 
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Enrique Parejo, a justice minister who resigned 
in 1986 and took an assignment as Colombia's ambassador in Hungary to escape 
death threats, was seriously wounded by gunmen who tracked him down in 
Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Carlos Hoyos was killed in January, 1988. In the latest 
assassinations attributed to drug traffickers, on Aug. 18, gunmen killed the 
Medellin commander of the national police as well as Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a 
leading candidate for presidential elections next March. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official confirmation of De Greiff's resignation, and some radio 
stations said that it would not be made official for 12 days, but the newspaper 
El Espectador said in its main headline Sunday: "Justice Minister Resigns." 
</P>
<P>
El Espectador quoted De Greiff as calling herself "a minister for times of 
peace." The newspaper also repeated unofficial reports that Barco has 
considered other Cabinet changes because some ministers had been reluctant to 
endorse his emergency decrees on extradition and seizure of properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allies in High Places 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Caballero, a columnist for El Espectador and an expert on drug 
trafficking, wrote in Sunday's paper that the drug Mafia has allies in high 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all politicians are like Luis Carlos Galan, and we know it too well: There 
are hundreds, some presidential hopefuls like him, who are friends of the 
narcos, their protectors and proteges," Caballero said. "It is not true, by 
far, that 'the whole country' is at war with the Mafia. On the contrary: Half 
of the country is its ally, its partner or its hireling." 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities have arrested several accused traffickers in the past 
week, including some wanted in the United States, none of the top leaders of 
the Medellin cartel or other big trafficking groups have been captured. 
Speculative reports said that Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Jorge 
Luis Ochoa and other big bosses might be in neighboring Brazil, Panama, Peru or 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Defense spokesman said that Colombian authorities are 
coordinating their search for the drug barons with Interpol, the international 
police coordinating organization. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper El Tiempo reported Sunday that three magistrates of a special 
tribunal revoked a Colombian arrest warrant against Escobar on Aug. 15. The 
same three magistrates had previously approved the warrant, but they revoked it 
after another judge in the case, Helena Diaz Perez, was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant charged Escobar with ordering massacres on two banana plantations 
in which about 30 workers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have linked the Medellin cartel to highly trained "paramilitary" 
death squads that have killed hundreds of leftists and others in rural 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party's Support Promised 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lleras Restrepo, a former Colombian president and a member of Barco's 
Liberal Party, said in an article published Sunday that the president's battle 
against the traffickers will have "the clear support of all sectors of the 
party." 
</P>
<P>
But Ernesto Samper, one of the Liberal Party's several presidential hopefuls, 
proposed a national referendum on whether "to stop the war against 
narco-trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not have sufficient means to go ahead with this 
struggle, it should not continue," Samper said. "But if the course taken is to 
maintain the repression, we have to be ready to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
DRUG LORDS ON RUN 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's top 12 traffickers are "marked men," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
said. Page 10

MEXICO CRACKS DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At daybreak, Mexican immigration agent Raymundo Palomec marched eight young men 
down to the bank of the Suchiate River, Mexico's southern border, piled them 
onto a makeshift raft and dispatched them to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
The eight -- illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic -- had been nabbed 
the night before in the town of Tapachula, the first stop on a clandestine 
journey north to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to return them at the bridge, but the Guatemalans wouldn't accept 
them. So I sent them back the way they came," Palomec explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's in Their Hands' 
</P>
<P>
The agent kept watch on the jungle river bank until he spotted the Dominicans 
marching single file behind a Guatemalan border guard. "That's it!" he shouted 
triumphantly. "Now it's in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
That deportation Friday was unorthodox at best, and quite possibly illegal, but 
it nonetheless illustrates the Mexican government's new, aggressive policy 
against illegal immigration by Central and South Americans and people from 
other countries who use Mexico as a trampoline to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, officials say they have deported 46,000 
illegal immigrants from Mexico, most of them Central Americans. While amounting 
to less than one-tenth of deportations made by the United States during a 
similar period, that figure is more than all of the deportations from Mexico 
during the previous three calendar years combined. 
</P>
<P>
For every illegal immigrant who is caught, however, countless others make their 
way north. Thus, Mexican officials say they are doing battle on both borders. 
Days before Palomec's maneuver in the south, Baja California state police 
carried out a pincer operation with the U.S. Border Patrol that netted nearly 
500 people attempting a dash across the Tijuana-San Ysidro border. 
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has come under attack 
at home for launching such pro-Yanqui police operations against the border 
crossers, a majority of whom are Mexican citizens. But Mexican officials say 
the raids will continue. They say that illegal immigration, particularly from 
Central America, has become a Mexican problem, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who don't make it to the United States stay in Mexico," a senior Mexican 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overjoyed by Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are overjoyed by the new, bilateral cooperation, and they also 
insist that the joint sweeps "are absolutely necessary," even though, one 
conceded, "they look terrible, like a binational roundup of human beings." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be identified, said the cooperation between U.S. 
and Mexican immigration officials has been developing since the outset of the 
Salinas administration. "Under this administration, the Mexicans are more 
receptive to intelligence that we pass on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the change, President Salinas met with Guatemalan President 
Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo at the Suchiate River earlier this month, and the two 
agreed that their governments would work together against illegal immigration. 
One immediate step they took was to make the western border area a free-trade 
zone. Mexican immigration official Baltazar Mejia said the move was meant in 
part "to try to compensate" local merchants who had been profiting from 
business with illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration is big business, particularly for the so-called coyotes, 
who can earn from $1,500 to $3,000 per person for a trip from San Salvador or 
Guatemala City to Los Angeles. Along the way, there is money to be made for 
truck drivers, hotel and boarding house owners and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities claim to be clamping down on the official corruption that 
has allowed so many immigrants to make their way into Mexico and north to the 
U.S. border. Mejia said that he laid off 10 of the 89 agents in the Tapachula 
sector last April because they allegedly took bribes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Detained 
</P>
<P>
Last week at the Talisman border crossing, Mexican agents reported to Mejia 
that they had tried to detain a Guatemalan immigration official whom they 
caught chauffeuring three Salvadorans into Mexico with false documents. 
</P>
<P>
According to their written report, the Guatemalan agent, Joel Mendez Pinto, 
threatened to punch out his Mexican colleagues before he fled on foot back to 
Guatemala. The Salvadorans were detained for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Several immigrants, however, said in interviews that either they or their 
fellow travelers had been touched for bribes by Mexican officials. A 
30-year-old Salvadoran woman from La Libertad province said that twice in her 
journey to Mexico City she saw Mexican immigration officials demand payment to 
let Guatemalan immigrants continue north. 
</P>
<P>
Once, she said, a Guatemalan woman paid $70 each for herself and her five 
children traveling illegally. And a bus driver asked for $100 to make an 
unscheduled stop before reaching the North Terminal in Mexico City, where 
immigration agents are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old Salvadoran from Usulutan province waiting in Guatemala to cross 
illegally with his wife, 5-year-old daughter and a friend said that he was 
caught by Mexican immigration agents a couple months ago and had to pay a bribe 
of about $80 just to be given food. Then he was deported. 
</P>
<P>
"The discourse at high levels is magnificent," said Bishop Luis Miguel Canton 
Marin, the Roman Catholic prelate of Tapachula, "but when you talk about 
reality, it gets very complicated. There are many interests." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Canton's diocese daily feeds illegal immigrants who show up hungry and 
attends to the spiritual needs of about half of the estimated 40,000 Central 
Americans who live illegally in Chiapas state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Difficult to Get Through 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the ongoing corruption, Canton and the immigrants themselves say 
it is now decidedly more difficult to get through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"They are definitely turning people back," said Candice de Arteaga, 38, one of 
a dozen immigrants waiting for deportation at the Manguito checkpoint, about 15 
miles north of Ciudad Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
De Arteaga, the mother of seven, worked for two years as a maid in Los Angeles 
before returning home for a visit last year. "The last time I did this, it was 
nothing. I was crazy to ever come back. . . . But I have my children in 
Guatemala," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the immigrants interviewed, Arteaga said that robbers stole her 
savings -- about $200 -- as she crossed the border. Juan Mendez, 31, said a 
fellow Salvadoran whom he teamed with in Guatemala City stole his stash of 
about $50 one night after he fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
There are other dangers too. A truck carrying more than 40 Salvadorans and 
Hondurans overturned on the road to Tonala last week, killing six and injuring 
30; five months ago, an unarmed Mexican agent was shot at a checkpoint when he 
tried to detain a Salvadoran; women immigrants sometimes report rapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Frontier 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, Mexico's southern border is a typical frontier, fraught with 
prostitutes, bandits, traffickers and too many unknown people passing through. 
On the Guatemalan side, not far from Ciudad Hidalgo, the town of Tecun Uman is 
called "the waiting station" or "Little Tijuana" and has grown from 8,000 to 
20,000 population in less than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rough-and-tumble town of dusty pensions and cheap restaurants, its 
central park teeming with young men carrying tell-tale flight bags full of the 
few belongings they hope to carry to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the river bank, scores of young men make their living by swimming the river 
with inner-tube rafts tied to their waists by rope. For about a quarter, they 
will illegally transport anyone who wants to go, including two journalists. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, immigration officials look the other way at the illegal river 
traffic. Each day, hundreds of shoppers and vendors cross the border that way, 
as do many of the approximately 50,000 Guatemalan seasonal workers who cross 
the river to pick coffee on Mexican plantations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural flow," said Bishop Canton. "This border is just a political 
division, nothing else."

MADE KEY CONCESSION; 
</P>
<P>
HAMMER PARDON TURNED ON THE ISSUE OF INNOCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks ago, in his first exercise of that most royal of all presidential 
prerogatives, George Bush conferred "full and unconditional" pardons on nine 
Americans with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
Eight were felons, convicted of everything from tax evasion and illegal 
possession of firearms to fraudulent land grabs and kickback schemes. They were 
more than happy to admit, and lavishly repent, their crimes in exchange for the 
restoration of their civil rights. One, for example, a security guard, won back 
his right to tote a gun. 
</P>
<P>
For these eight, the presidential pardons process had been relatively 
straightforward, inexpensive and benign. Most simply filled out a free, 
four-page Justice Department form, provided character references, then went 
home to wait it out while the FBI sifted through their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But for the ninth, Los Angeles industrialist and philanthropist Dr. Armand 
Hammer, the experience had been a long and frustrating ordeal. He was 91 years 
old and no felon. He had never lost his civil rights. Instead, he had been 
trying to rid his record of three 13-year-old misdemeanors. And he wasn't 
lavishly repenting anything. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, despite Hammer's protestations of innocence, his pardon read the 
same as all the others. And he wouldn't have gotten even that had he not made a 
key concession. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Hammer's pardon for making $54,000 in illegal contributions to 
Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign is a classic reminder that, when it comes to 
pardons, the system does not bend unless the President says so. The pardoning 
power, an utterly discretionary bit of imperial largess written into the 
Constitution amid the checks and balances, belongs to him alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Jimmy Carter -- who pardoned World War II traitor Iva (Tokyo Rose) 
Toguri and, posthumously, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, who treated President Abraham 
Lincoln's assassin -- are relatively generous with that largess. Others, like 
Ronald Reagan -- who awarded Hammer a National Medal for the Arts and made him 
chairman of the President's Cancer Panel but did not pardon him -- are less 
forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
In Hammer's case, say officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, the 
pardon was stalled not by presidential indifference but by the nature of the 
request itself -- and Hammer's refusal to change it. 
</P>
<P>
For what Hammer had been seeking -- but didn't get -- was not just a 
garden-variety presidential pardon but one based on a finding of innocence -- 
in effect, an executive decree that he was never guilty in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Virtually Unheard Of 
</P>
<P>
Such a pardon is virtually unheard of, so unprecedented that Hammer's own 
attorneys cite only two examples of it in the last 50 years and U.S. Pardons 
Atty. David C. Stephenson, a 20-year veteran of the office, says he can't 
recall details of either case. 
</P>
<P>
But, the officials say, it explains why George Bush acted when Ronald Reagan 
would not -- even though Reagan, in his last days in office, pardoned New York 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner on felony charges of making illegal 
contributions to the same Nixon campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Steinbrenner," notes a Bush White House legal official, "was willing to accept 
an ordinary pardon." 
</P>
<P>
Armand Hammer did not back down easily. He is a man, as one of his friends 
says, "who is unaccustomed to taking no for an answer" or, as a critic says, 
whose "chutzpah knows no bounds." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, Occidental Petroleum founder, art patron and self-styled emissary of 
East-West relations, has been protesting his innocence almost since the day he 
entered a guilty plea in 1975 and then again in 1976. His determination to 
"clear my name" has been so well publicized that, by now, it is as central to 
Hammer's image as his search for a cure for cancer and his 45-minute meeting 72 
years ago with V. I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charity Donations 
</P>
<P>
Associates say one reason for Hammer's obsession is that he has long been 
convinced that the misdemeanors account for his failure to win a Nobel prize, 
despite nominations. Over the years, he has contributed millions of dollars to 
medical research, to the arts, education and countless other worthy causes the 
world over. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Hammer is a totally selfless man, the kind of man who is too good for most 
people to believe," says his Philadelphia attorney, Bruce W. Kauffman. "He 
contributes at least 90% of his income to service of mankind. I'm just so 
grateful to President Bush, that he acted so responsibly, so humanely, so well, 
with such statesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman has been one of Hammer's leading attorneys since he plunged into the 
formal pardons process in 1984. Kauffman had once been appointed by Bush's 
attorney general, former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh, to fill a two-year 
vacancy on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, leading to speculation that the 
connection might have given Hammer's petition a new boost. 
</P>
<P>
But like any other supplicant, Hammer filed an application and letters of 
character reference -- along with a thick, slick legal brief arguing his case 
-- with Pardons Atty. Stephenson, a little-known public official who controls 
the first phase of the process. 
</P>
<P>
With around 300 requests annually, it is up to Stephenson to make the first 
cut. The only real rules are that you show remorse and demonstrate an exemplary 
life style for at least five years after the crime -- and then submit to a 
background investigation by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
This is, of course, expensive. And because it costs the government thousands of 
dollars to process each petition, misdemeanor offenses are almost routinely 
rejected as too trivial to bother with. Stephenson made an exception for 
Hammer, he says, "because of his outstanding record of service to mankind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Defense 
</P>
<P>
In his interviews with Stephenson, Hammer repeated a defense he has made in his 
autobiographies, through his lawyers and in interviews through the years. 
(Hammer would not comment for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he made the 1972 contribution in good faith, before a new 
campaign disclosure law went into effect. He blames his courier, former Montana 
Gov. Tim Babcock, who pleaded guilty to a related charge, for misdirecting the 
money and then lying about it. And he says the only reason he entered a guilty 
plea was because his lawyers pressured him into it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only days after admitting guilt in a plea bargain in U.S. District 
Court in Washington in 1975, Hammer lamented his innocence to his parole 
officer. When the presiding judge heard about it, he ordered Hammer back into 
court. Hammer fell ill, proceedings were moved to Los Angeles due to his health 
and, five months later, accompanied by an army of doctors, he was wheeled into 
court and pleaded guilty a second time. He was sentenced to a year's probation 
and fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has since insisted that he uncovered "new evidence" that exonerates him. 
He points in particular to a snatch of taped conversation with Nixon prior to 
the campaign deadline, in which Hammer mentions his contribution. Hammer also 
says $39,000 of his money was never even applied to the campaign, so it 
technically was not even a campaign contribution. And, finally, he contends he 
was a victim of a double standard applied by Watergate prosectors in 
interpreting the laws. 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson was persuaded. Although he will not publicly confirm it, his 
superiors say he recommended in favor of Hammer's extraordinary request. 
</P>
<P>
But Stephenson is only the first stop on the way to the White House. From his 
office, pardon petitions are reviewed by the associate attorney general (then 
Stephen S. Trott, now a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals) and 
sometimes by the attorney general himself (then Edwin Meese III) before being 
sent to White House counsel and finally to the President. 
</P>
<P>
Formally, Hammer's petition never made it past the second stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Incredible' 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible," recalls a former Justice Department official from the 
Reagan years. "We were ready to give him a pardon on regular grounds -- for 
showing remorse, leading an exemplary life, all that. We were unanimous in our 
opinion that he deserved that. 
</P>
<P>
"But Hammer said no, he didn't want that. He wanted the U.S. government to 
declare him innocent, and there was simply no evidence to support that . . . . 
He appealed it to Meese, to everybody under the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Another former top-level official in the Reagan Justice Department contends 
that, "in all fairness," Hammer never should have been convicted. "But we 
decided there really were no new grounds for an innocence pardon, no dramatic 
new evidence," he said. "Besides, you just can't resolve legal issues in a 
pardon. That isn't their purpose. They are statements of forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
(In fact, history is studded with examples of people who actually rejected a 
pardon rather than concede guilt.) 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1987. By then, Hammer's formal petition had been in the system for 
three years -- which is not unusual. It takes at least that long for ordinary 
applications, mainly because of the time-consuming background investigations. 
At present, Stephenson has a backlog of about 700 petitions. 
</P>
<P>
But Armand Hammer wasn't getting any younger. Traditional Christmas pardons 
were announced, random lists were released now and then, birthdays came and 
went. Armand Hammer called his attorneys constantly for news, one day from 
Moscow, from Afghanistan the next, from London, Beijing, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys made emotional pleas for the pardon based on his age. "We had so 
hoped," says Kauffman, "that Reagan would grant him the pardon in time for his 
90th birthday." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired Attorney 
</P>
<P>
In his increasing displeasure, Hammer fired his Washington attorney, a former 
Justice Department official himself, on grounds that he should have managed, 
with his firsthand knowledge of the process and the players, to produce better 
results. But Hammer's old friend Kauffman and his colleague, Paul S. Diamond, 
couldn't make it happen either. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in May, Hammer sent a three-paragraph letter to Deputy Associate Atty. 
Gen. Cary H. Copeland. "I am herewith changing my request for a pardon based on 
innocence to one seeking a conventional pardon," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Bush gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
To Hammer's attorneys, it remains a shame that such a distinguished man should 
have been subjected to the grinding pardons process in the first place. Earlier 
this year, for example, Justice Department security guards refused to admit 
Hammer into the building because he had no picture identification. 
</P>
<P>
"They made us sit in the lobby for 15 minutes until somebody came for us," 
recalls Diamond. "I mean, what did they think this 90-year-old man was going to 
do? But Dr. Hammer was good-natured about it." Diamond calls the pardons 
process "a great leveler." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, most presidents have used the pardon power sparingly, even in 
high-profile petitions. According to Stephenson, almost 90% of routine requests 
are rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon B. Johnson was the most generous President in the last 30 years, issuing 
1,241 in five years. Nixon doled out 863 in six years, Gerald R. Ford 382 in 
two (including his controversial preemptive pardon of Nixon). Excluding his 
blanket amnesty to Vietnam draft resisters, Carter gave out 543 in his one 
term. 
</P>
<P>
The stingiest was Ronald Reagan, who granted only 393 pardons during his eight 
years in office. (Not that Reagan was shy about using the pardon when his sense 
of injustice was aroused. He had barely unpacked at the White House before he 
issued unsolicited pardons to two FBI agents convicted of illegal break-ins 
during the early 1970s at the homes of families and friends of suspected 
members of the radical Weather Underground. Reagan said the agents had acted 
not with "criminal intent" but on "high principle" to fight terrorism.) 
</P>
<P>
But those involved in Hammer's original guilty plea say, if anything, he got 
better treatment that the average petitioner. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't have been treated any differently than thousands of other 
white-collar criminals," says former assistant Watergate prosecutor Thomas 
McBride, now at 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Law School. "There were no new, extenuating circumstances in his case. 
Even his (charitable) giving has always been tainted by self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
"He pleaded guilty, so I have to assume he was guilty," says former Watergate 
prosecutor Henry Ruth. "My view of the pardon process is that it should be 
given only in extraordinary circumstances, and I haven't heard of any in either 
Hammer's or Steinbrenner's cases. But they happen to be rich, powerful people, 
so I guess that's why they get them." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is standard procedure for prosecutors and judges to be consulted 
before pardons are granted, Ruth was not, nor was federal Judge Lawrence 
Lydick. Charles Ruff, the final prosecutor in Hammer's case and now a Tucson 
attorney, was consulted but, sources say, would neither oppose nor support any 
kind of pardon. 
</P>
<P>
The day of his pardon, Hammer issued a statement expressing his gratitude for 
"President Bush's action in clearing my name." Beyond that, he refused public 
comment. His attorneys are less restrained. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, an ordinary pardon requires that you admit guilt and show remorse," 
Kauffman said. "And Dr. Hammer has certainly never done that. He is innocent, 
and he has not admitted he did anything wrong. So this is a sort of hybrid 
pardon, somewhere in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
As for the May letter, Kauffman says: "We just decided not to get hung up on 
words, on the innocence thing. A pardon is a pardon." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman's partner, Diamond, was even more effusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, this is a singular event in U.S. pardon history," he crows. "You look 
at those applications. Everybody else pardoned has to admit guilt, say they're 
sorry in no uncertain terms. And we didn't. He didn't. Just look at that letter 
he wrote, he doesn't say he's sorry he violated any law. He says he's sorry 
that it was perceived as a violation of the law. This is a complete victory as 
far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
In his May letter, Hammer contended that he would not have pleaded guilty "but 
for a series of extenuating circumstances." He added: 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that in the eyes of the law I now stand convicted of three 
misdemeanor offenses. I have a profound respect for the law of the United 
States and have always scrupulously sought to conform my conduct to those laws 
in all respects. I sincerely regret that my record appears otherwise, even in 
some technical aspect." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush White House sees it otherwise. "The President has accepted Armand 
Hammer's acknowledgment of guilt, and his years of service to the community. 
And it was made very very clear to Dr. Hammer that he had to express remorse," 
says the White House legal official. "Oh, he tried to do it in an ambiguous 
way, of course, sort of cutesy. But he did it."

FIRE LOOKOUT LIVES IN SECLUDED '360-DEGREE WORLD' ATOP PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CONE PEAK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her name is Soaring Jenkins. She lives alone in a 13-by-13-foot glass house on 
top of this remote, mile-high mountain reached by a tortuous two-mile, 
almost-straight-up twisting trail. 
</P>
<P>
She has no electricity or indoor plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week the 115-pound, 5-foot, 7-inch Jenkins carries her food and supplies 
up the steep, rocky footpath except for extra-heavy items like 20-gallon 
cartons of water delivered by mules once a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Singing, Playing Harp 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, 37, spends several hours a day singing and playing Irish and Welsh 
songs on a harp as she sits on top of Cone Peak, said to be one of the sheerest 
mountains in the West. The mountain spills into the Pacific Ocean midway 
between Big Sur and San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
Between songs Jenkins scours the skies in all directions looking for puffs of 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Forest Service lookout on Cone Peak for five years, Jenkins is one of a 
vanishing breed. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s the Forest Service had 5,060 manned fire lookout towers 
across America, 3,470 of them erected by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 
1930s. Today there are fewer than 600, fewer than 100 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
Satellites, aerial surveillance, computerized maps of lightning strikes, 
commercial and private pilots flying over the mountains, people with civilian 
band radios driving on far more mountainous roads than in the past are all able 
to spot the fires as quick as the fire lookouts except in extremely isolated 
areas like Cone Peak. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in a 360-degree world. I see the curve in the sky. I feel the curve of 
the earth up here. I can see Mt. Whitney on a clear clear day, see 88 miles out 
to sea. I'm always the last one to see the sun set around here," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indian Prayer 
</P>
<P>
Her bed is four feet off the ground at window level so she can see at night. 
"If there are lightning strikes, I wake up with them. On a full moon I wake up 
squinting from the brightness," she added. She told how she says an Indian 
prayer when the sun awakens her each new day: 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty's before me. Beauty's behind me. Beauty's all around me. Beauty's above 
me. Beauty's below me. Beauty's inside me." 
</P>
<P>
Were you given the name Soaring at birth, she is asked. "Oh, no. I always hated 
my first name. I won't tell you what it was." 
</P>
<P>
She spots and reports whiffs of smoke, mostly from lightning strikes from time 
to time during the seven months she lives on the mountain each year. She also 
has a house in Big Sur. She directs firefighters by radio to fires. She has a 
CB and occasionally gets calls from people reporting a car over the cliff on 
California 1 or a fishing boat in distress will radio for help. She relays the 
calls to the Los Padres National Forest dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a baptism of fire my first month here in 1985. There was a huge fire 
all through these mountains. I relayed information over the radio to 
firefighting crews. I couldn't see as the fire approached for the dense smoke," 
she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"The lead plane of an air attack crew radioed that a helicopter better fly to 
Cone Peak right away or it would be too late to get me out. The fire was 
closing in. I was sitting on the floor operating the radios. I couldn't see out 
the window. I was on the floor where it was cooler. I was having a tough time 
breathing because of the smoke." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flown to Safety 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter flew her to safety. The forest on Cone Peak was charred. She later 
received a certificate of commendation for her heroic work during the fire and 
a $150 award. "They flew me back here five days later. Everything was black. 
Luckily my tower was not burned." 
</P>
<P>
She said she looks in every direction about every five to 10 minutes. "When I 
read a book, I turn a page and look. When I play the harp, I keep looking 
around. The first week on the job I was a nervous wreck. I looked every minute. 
You have to learn to pace yourself. You can't be too hyper about it." 
</P>
<P>
Although the trail leading to her peak is reached by a seldom-traveled 13-mile 
one-lane winding mountainous road, the last five miles dirt, a few hikers 
manage to find their way to the mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy from Italy was here yesterday. Being here is being both alone and being 
social. Being alone helps you sort out things deep inside," she related. 
</P>
<P>
"Being social means being friendly with strangers who hike up. Sometimes I go 
for days alone. Some weekends as many as a dozen people will hike up here, 
mostly men, 93% of them real nice, 6% jerks and 1% weirdos who can be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, the odds are better than in the city. The trail is a killer. Many who 
try are wiped out before they're halfway up. I have yet to see anyone arrive 
who is not dripping wet." 
</P>
<P>
It takes her an hour-and-a-half to walk up each week loaded down with a 
backpack full of necessities weighing at least 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
She is off the mountain two days a week. She is paid for a 40-hour week 
although she looks through her binoculars from sunup to sundown searching for 
smoke. Her pay is $6.75 an hour, "high in job satisfaction, low in wages," as 
she describes it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Room Home 
</P>
<P>
Her one-room home is combination kitchen, bedroom and living room. It has a 
propane refrigerator, stove, heater and lights. The propane is flown in once a 
year on a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a day she radios weather information. She sleeps with the radio going all 
night and is tuned in only to those calls that affect her. "I spent a year 
studying Zen meditation. Even when I'm sleeping I'm always present and know 
what's going on and respond immediately to calls for me." 
</P>
<P>
She is never really alone, of course. Swallowtail and monarch butterflies and 
hummingbirds share the top of the mountain. On the trail she encounters deer, 
quail, doves, chipmunks, squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
"One night I was sitting watching the sunset and felt something nibbling on my 
shoe. Eeekkk! It was a wood rat. What a horrible feeling. Once I killed a 
rattlesnake at the tower," said Jenkins, describing the local wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
She is a vegetarian, drinks juices, eats a lot of potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
salads and other vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins was a teacher before she became a Forest Service lookout. "Living here 
has made me a better person," she mused. "I've had the same boyfriend 10 years, 
a Forest Ranger. We're going to get married in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Come fall, it's time to go down the mountain to my home in Big Sur, and I'm 
ready to leave. By then it's cold and blustery up here. Every spring I can 
hardly wait to return. I plan to be on the lookout on Cone Peak until I'm at 
least 87."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fran Baron received an anxious telephone call some weeks ago from a woman 
living next to a wooded area of San Francisco's scenic Army post, the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Baron, there's a swarm of bees in the park and the SPCA told me to call 
you to see if you could remove it." 
</P>
<P>
No problem, replied Baron, who donned overalls, gloves and a straw hat with 
netting over it. Carrying a cardboard box with a piece of khaki cloth attached 
to one side, Baron, 67, approached the swarm buzzing under a bottlebrush tree 
and shook the limb above it, expertly guiding the 10,000 bees into his box. 
Then he covered the box with the cloth, carried the bees home and added them to 
his two hives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bee Phobia 
</P>
<P>
Snaring a swarm for a nervous citizen was a relatively simple act for the 
10-year beekeeper, who is used to people's fears about bees. These fears can 
sometimes cause people to want to deprive him of his hives, and even push for 
laws to ban beekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, however, it is Baron, along with the hundreds of other beekeepers 
in San Francisco, who might be called on some day to perform a major public 
service: helping the city shoo away swarms of Africanized bees. 
</P>
<P>
Africanized or "killer" bees -- introduced to Brazil from Africa in 1957 -- 
have been slowly working their way north through South and Central America. 
Experts expect them to enter the United States through Texas and possibly make 
their way to California in three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Though they rarely kill and are no more venomous than other bees, Africanized 
bees are more easily disturbed by people and animals than domestic, or 
European, bees, according to Howell Daly, an entomology professor at UC 
Berkeley. When threatened, Africanized bees have been known to attack in swarms 
and engage in a frenzy of stinging that can last up to 30 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Provocations 
</P>
<P>
It will be especially important to keep Africanized bees away from cities where 
they are most likely to be provoked, said Stanley Williams, a biology professor 
at San Francisco State University. Scientists say they are relying greatly in 
this effort on the urban beekeepers and their hives of domestic bees, because 
it will be harder for the invaders to take root where other bees already exist. 
</P>
<P>
"Urban colonies are the big hope," Williams said. "By having well-established 
communities with such gentle bees, it will greatly impair the establishment of 
the killer bees." 
</P>
<P>
Beekeepers also can help by artificially inseminating the queen bees in their 
hives, thus denying the opportunity of the invaders to breed with domestic 
bees, the experts say. Each hive has one queen that mates only once in her 
lifetime. By artificially inseminating the queen, beekeepers will eliminate the 
chance of her pairing with an Africanized bee. 
</P>
<P>
If beekeepers can keep Africanized bees out of their hives, chances are slimmer 
that the aggressive bees will establish colonies on their own, because there is 
only so much pollen to go around. Without pollen, which is used to feed young 
bees, the colonies cannot survive, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't reproduce, it will slow down the establishment of Africanized 
bees and they will move outside the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50-Million Industry 
</P>
<P>
In rural areas of the state, there no doubt will be invasions of Africanized 
bees into domestic colonies, particularly commercial colonies, bee experts say. 
Commercial bees are used to pollinate crops, produce honey and make queens, 
generating $50 million a year in agricultural income in California, according 
to Eric Musson, a bee expert at UC Davis. Musson and others say there should be 
no serious economic consequences by the introduction of the Africanized bees 
into these commercial colonies. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also say the specter of advancing swarms of Africanized bees should 
be no cause for panic. They point out that people in Central and South America 
have co-existed with Africanized bees for years. They "are not marauders," said 
Norman Gary, a UC Davis entomology professor. "They're not out to kill people 
and animals." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't stand to reason (to call them) killer bees," added Leonore Bravo, a 
13-year San Francisco beekeeper. "The population of Africa wouldn't be left." 
</P>
<P>
About 350 people have died from stings of Africanized bees in Central and South 
America over the past 30 years, Musson said. Although several stray colonies of 
Africanized bees, believed to have come from a truckload of imported cargo, 
were found near Bakersfield in 1985, no one in the United States is known to 
have died from the sting of Africanized bees. 
</P>
<P>
Although the experts say the urban beekeepers are the main hope of keeping 
Africanized bees out of cities, beekeepers have traditionally struggled with a 
public relations problem. They tend to "have difficulty," says Daly, with those 
who want to outlaw domestic bee hives in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
As beekeepers know, beehives are widely regarded as lairs of a harmful enemy 
rather than homes to friendly defenders. Because bees swarm and sting, people 
who fear them often do not want them nearby, particularly in the close quarters 
of urban living. 
</P>
<P>
As San Francisco has shown, it can take just one person's complaint to threaten 
continued beekeeping. In July, City Supervisor Jim Gonzales proposed an 
ordinance outlawing residential beekeeping after a constituent complained that 
she was afraid to go outside because of her neighbor's beehives. Blackberry 
bushes in her back yard went unattended, she said, because the bees frightened 
away gardeners she tried to hire. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ordinance failed, Gonzales said he plans to reintroduce it in 
September. If it passes, San Francisco will join Los Angeles and several other 
cities that impose restrictions on beekeeping. The Los Angeles law confines 
beekeeping to property that is widely separated from the nearest neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
An outright ban "because of one person's fear seems to be an overreaction," 
said Richard Avanzino, San Francisco SPCA president. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absurd," said Williams of San Francisco State. To ban bees "would be like 
passing an ordinance against flowers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 people a year in the United States die from bee stings, said Musson of 
UC Davis. The latest fatal attack in California took place last month in a 
Fresno County cantaloupe patch when Mary Gaxiola, 66, drove a truck into a 
group of hives and died from 136 bee stings. 
</P>
<P>
Local beekeepers said they occasionally get stung, adding that people can 
unwittingly provoke bees by operating power gardening tools too close to the 
hive or walking in a bee's flight path. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists and local apiculturists -- the formal name for beekeepers -- 
argue that bees have value that far outweighs their danger. Besides being able 
to ward off future swarms of Africanized bees, domestic bees produce honey and 
pollinate plants and fruit trees. A bee ban, says Williams, would significantly 
alter the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so precious, so important to humankind that we try to protect them as 
much as possible," said Louis Dubay, who holds the title of San Francisco's 
honorary beekeeper, bestowed by a mayor some years ago. Dubay, 81, famed for 
working with bees with his bare hands, isn't alone in his enthusiasm for bees. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, California boasts at least 10,000 hobby beekeepers and about 20 
beekeeping organizations, including the California State Beekeepers Assn., 
which has nearly 300 members, Musson said.

FOUNDATION TO DEMAND CRIB RECALL

A consumer group planned today to demand the recall of millions of baby cribs 
because they have protruding corner posts that can snag a child's clothing, 
necklace or pacifier cord and cause strangulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Danny Foundation (named for Danny Lineweaver, a California boy who suffered 
brain damage after his shirt got caught on a crib post) planned to file a 
petition with the Consumer Product Safety Commission asking it to ban 
protruding corner posts or knobs and recall cribs with such features. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Walsh, executive director of the foundation, said the proposed recall 
would apply to perhaps 10 million cribs. 
</P>
<P>
A voluntary industry standard adopted in 1986 allows crib posts or decorative 
knobs to protrude no more than 5/8 inch. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Pavlich of the safety agency said the commission's staff recommended in 
May that manufacturers consider revising that rule.

ISRAEL DEPORTS 5 PALESTINIANS; SHIITE STRONGHOLD BOMBED

<P>
Israel on Sunday deported a prominent Arab activist and four other Palestinians 
accused of leading the uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The deportations raised to 60 the number of Palestinians expelled from the 
occupied territories during the 20-month uprising against Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
Four Palestinians were deported to Lebanon. A fifth, physicist Taysir Aruri, 
whose cause has been championed by international human rights groups, was 
expelled to France after he appealed to Israel's Supreme Court, saying he could 
face death in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Guerrilla Killed 
</P>
<P>
The deportations came as Israeli warplanes bombed a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim 
stronghold in southeastern Lebanon, killing one guerrilla and wounding five 
others, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Aruri's wife brought their three young children to Ben-Gurion Airport to see 
their father off. But she was removed by police after she became the center of 
a scuffle involving pro-Palestinian demonstrators and angry Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Aruri did not speak to reporters when he arrived in Paris. There has been 
speculation he was headed for Tunis, Tunisia, headquarters of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. But late Sunday, PLO sources said he could be planning 
to go to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Aruri is welcome 
indefinitely in France. 
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said Sunday on Israel Army Radio that 
Israel will continue to deport Palestinians despite complaints by foreign 
governments, including the United States, and human rights groups that the 
action violates the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</P>
<P>
None of the five Palestinians expelled Sunday faced trial or formal charges. 
Appeals by four of the men were rejected by the Supreme Court on Thursday, and 
the fifth was turned down a month earlier. The court has never overturned an 
army deportation order. 
</P>
<P>
Aruri, 43, a physics professor at the West Bank's Birzeit University, was named 
a "prisoner of conscience" by Amnesty International. He was accused of being a 
member of the outlawed Palestinian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The army also said he was "involved in planning the uprising and a member of 
the uprising's unified command." The announcement of the four other 
deportations said the men "participated in leading and directing the uprising" 
in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
One deportee, Mohammed Matur, was accused by the army of being a leader of 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah 
faction. The others were said to be members of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, a leftist PLO group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Lebanon 
</P>
<P>
On arrival in southern Lebanon, the four asked to be taken to bases of the 
Democratic Front in the western Bekaa Valley, Lebanese police said. 
</P>
<P>
Aruri has held meetings with Israeli peace activists. In an article printed 
Friday in the English-language Jerusalem Post, he urged a peaceful solution to 
the Arab-Israeli conflict and the creation of a Palestinian state alongside 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, the crowd started shouting and pushing after five demonstrators 
showed up with signs saying "Don't Deport Palestinians. Talk Peace to Them." 
Television crews, photographers and reporters also were pushed around by angry 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's air raid into Lebanon was believed to be in retaliation for the Aug. 9 
suicide car bomb attack carried out by the Iranian-supported Hezbollah, 
believed to be the umbrella organization for a number of Shiite terrorist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has said it carried out the bombing to avenge 
Israel's kidnaping of a Shiite Muslim cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, one of 
its leaders. Israeli commandos seized Obeid in southern Lebanon on July 28.

DRUG 'HIT SQUAD' REPORTS SPUR ISRAELI PROBE

Police opened an inquiry Sunday into Israelis suspected of training death 
squads for Colombian drug barons, and a retired army officer named in the 
scandal said the probe could implicate other officers and a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
Yehoshua Caspi, head of the police investigations unit, said investigators 
would examine "all aspects of Israelis suspected of selling military services 
and know-how without Defense Ministry permission to unofficial groups in 
Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Defense Ministry had requested the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel Television that the allegations 
contained a "certain amount of exaggeration" and that the government had no 
part in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Lt. Col. Yair Klein, who has been named by Israeli media as a mercenary 
who worked in Colombia, said on Israel Radio that he called Caspi on Sunday and 
asked to meet with the investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he is prepared to name a member of Parliament involved in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to give any details about the legislator other than to say he is a 
former army officer. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Colombia said four Israelis, along with American, British and 
South African mercenaries, were involved in training assassins for drug 
smugglers in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, in his first comments on the mercenary scandal, said on Israel 
Television: "It is not pleasant to hear that there are Israelis dealing in ugly 
things, but there are Israelis in all different parts of the world involved in 
all sorts of things. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of Israel cannot be responsible for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Edy Kaufman, an Israeli expert on Latin America, said Israel turns a 
blind eye to such training programs and to illegal arms sales because the trade 
is lucrative and gives jobs to former high-ranking military officers. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who returned to Israel from Miami on Friday, denied reports in the 
Israeli media that he was a mercenary who trained death squads for drug 
traffickers. But he said that last year he helped train banana growers and 
ranchers in Colombia's countryside to fight guerrillas. He said he was paid 
$40,000 for two monthlong weapons training courses he conducted with three 
other retired Israeli officers and said all of his dealings in Colombia "were 
according to the law."

DRUG LORDS 'MARKED MEN,' THORNBURGH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been "sightings" outside of Colombia of some of that country's top 
12 drug kingpins sought by the United States for prosecution, and they "are 
marked men around the world," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be awhile" before any of the leaders are apprehended, Thornburgh said 
on the CBS interview program "Face the Nation." But he said that Colombia is 
expected to deliver to U.S. authorities this week Eduardo Martinez Romero, an 
alleged money launderer for the Medellin drug cartel. If the expectation 
becomes reality, he will be the first Colombian handed over for U.S. 
prosecution since Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas restored 
extradition under an emergency decree. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who unwittingly led federal undercover agents to a Los Angeles 
money-laundering operation last spring, is wanted for trial on related charges 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Thornburgh on the television show, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.), Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, called for the formation of 
international SWAT teams to apprehend drug cartel leaders when they travel 
outside Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many of Them Have Fled' 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, many of them -- if not all of them -- have fled Colombia now," 
Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law enforcement sources familiar with the Colombian situation said that 
they do not share Biden's certainty that the cartel leaders have fled their 
homeland, contending that the vast resources under the traffickers' control 
have enabled them to avoid capture inside Colombia in earlier crackdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you raise the profile" of the drug traffickers, as Barco's crackdown 
did, "you encourage snitches (informants) and ordinary citizens to provide 
information, and this is what's been happening," one source said. "Now this all 
has to be sifted through." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh and Biden agreed that extradition to the United States for 
prosecution is the action that the Colombian traffickers most fear. "They 
apparently will go to any length to avoid being brought to an American 
courtroom," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
Extraditing Martinez this week, as Thornburgh predicted, would mark a 
significant accomplishment, because conditions attached to Barco's extradition 
decree require the approval of more than six Colombian Cabinet ministers and 
give the subject of the order the opportunity to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Be Given Asylum 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that, if reports are true in Colombia that the beleaguered 
nation's new justice minister, Monica de Greiff, has resigned or plans to 
resign next month after returning from a trip to the United States, she would 
be given asylum here "as other refugees from terrorism and the kind of violence 
that affects Colombia have always been." 
</P>
<P>
After the TV show, Thornburgh said that he had not met with De Greiff, who took 
the post July 16 and who, according to news reports in Colombia, left for 
Washington on Friday. She was scheduled to meet with U.S. officials here this 
week to discuss extradition details and U.S. aid to help protect her country's 
judges, prosecutors and police from attack by the cartel forces. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach her Sunday through U.S. officials and Colombian diplomats in 
Washington were unsuccessful. An Administration official who spoke late Sunday 
to the Associated Press said that De Greiff is in the United States, but the 
official refused to say whether she had resigned her Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said earlier that De Greiff's resignation "would not be surprising . 
. . because of the tragic record of violence and intimidation that has almost 
effectively neutralized law enforcement" in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department issued a travel warning Saturday night, asking Americans 
to postpone trips to Colombia. It said that the crackdown on narcotics 
traffickers "could raise the level of violence in some areas, and American 
citizens -- even though not specifically targeted -- could find themselves 
caught up in random violence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Specifications 
</P>
<P>
Both Thornburgh and William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of 
Drug Control Policy, who appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," declined to 
specify how President Bush proposes to finance the stepped-up war on drugs that 
he will announce Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
But Biden called for enacting a "sin tax" on cigarettes, beer, wine and liquor 
to pay for the multibillion-dollar effort, rather than diverting funds from 
other government programs, as the Administration has indicated it will propose. 
</P>
<P>
Biden contended that upping the taxes by a nickel on a six-pack of beer, six 
cents on a bottle of wine, 40 cents on a gallon of liquor and two cents on a 
pack of cigarettes "would pay for the entire drug effort and the entire drug 
bill we didn't pay for last year." 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Biden, who has been conducting a series of Judiciary Committee 
hearings on the performance of the government's anti-narcotics program, 
indicate that Senate Democrats will seek to influence the shape of the 
government's expanded efforts, especially in the light of polls showing that 
drugs have become the leading domestic problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who submitted the proposals from which Bush shaped the drug package, 
said that it will call "for the redeployment and reapportioning of funds from 
different accounts and moving funds into this effort on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, other things may have to wait so that we can take this 
initiative," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on the question of raising taxes to meet the drug threat, despite 
Bush's campaign pledge of no tax increases, Bennett said that he would not be 
reluctant, noting that "crack is worse than taxes." But he added that he does 
not think it will be necessary to raise taxes because "there are things on the 
table that we're paying for that just don't have the priority" that drugs 
command.

MOURNERS LAUD NEWTON IN DAYLONG WAKE

Admirers of Huey P. Newton filed slowly though a mortuary Sunday and paid 
respects to the Black Panther leader slain in a drug-ridden neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"He instilled the blackness in black," said Norma Corman, 38, one of hundreds 
of people who waited quietly in a three-block line under sunny skies to attend 
the daylong public wake for Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Newton, who co-founded the Black Panther Party in 1966 and became one of the 
most articulate representatives of the black militancy movement, was shot to 
death Tuesday in a dispute over crack cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He made us have black pride. He was a good man destroyed by the badness of 
drugs," said Corman, who said she knew Newton for the last 10 years and waited 
about an hour to walk past the open casket. 
</P>
<P>
A quiet hour for friends and invited guests was planned Sunday night at Allen 
Temple Baptist Church, where Newton's body was moved after the wake. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, including some of Newton's fellow radicals from the '60s 
and '70s, were expected to attend a public funeral today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrible tragedy for blacks. He stood for black pride in the '60s 
and now he stands for the decimation of blacks by crack," said LeRoy Johnson, 
44, another man in the line of mourners. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a self-proclaimed prison gang member who police say admitted killing 
Newton faces arraignment today on a charge of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Tyrone Robinson, 25, told them he shot Newton in 
self-defense after the 47-year-old former activist, who battled drug and 
alcohol addictions, pulled a gun on him and demanded crack cocaine. But police 
discounted the ex-convict's account.

WELCH PITCHES ATHLETICS TO A NOT-SO-TRIVIAL WIN OVER KANSAS CITY, 6-0 
</P>

<P>
In due time Bob Welch will be the answer to the trivia question, "Who won the 
game in which Nolan Ryan recorded his 5,000th strikeout?" But for now, the 
former Dodger right-hander is the stopper on the star-studded Oakland Athletic 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics had lost three in a row, were in danger of losing their one-game 
lead in the American League West and were going up against the charging Royals 
and sizzling rookie Tom Gordon Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Welch restored order, just as he did last Tuesday when he beat Ryan, holding 
the Royals to six hits in eight innings as the A's snapped their losing streak 
with a 6-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (15-7) extended his scoreless streak to 24 innings by winning his fourth 
consecutive start. He outpitched Gordon, who gave up a three-run home run to 
Rickey Henderson. Gordon (16-5) had won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie right-hander gave up three runs in the second inning, then retired 
16 consecutive batters before giving up two walks and Henderson's 10th home 
run. It was the first homer for the Athletics with more than one runner on base 
since July 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, who had won 11 out of 12, slipped to 3 1/2 games behind the 
Athletics, but in winning two of three from the A's and Angels served notice it 
is a three-team race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a heck of a baseball race," Welch said. "It'll be a dogfight to the 
end. This was definitely a big win for us. It cut off a losing streak and came 
against a team that was playing excellent baseball. I'm just glad I could give 
them a big game." 
</P>
<P>
Welch drew the praise of Manager Tony La Russa. "He's on a roll," La Russa 
said. "He made a lot of quality pitches. We've been in this situation before 
when we needed a big game and he's given it to us." 
</P>
<P>
Manager John Wathan was not at all downhearted by the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the feeling in their minds that we'll have to be reckoned with," he 
said. "We showed Oakland and California we're going to be tough to beat down 
the stretch." Boston 7, Detroit 1 -- Ellis Burks hit a grand slam at Boston and 
the Red Sox won their sixth in a row, but the joy was tempered by an injury to 
Wes Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner suffered a possible cheekbone fracture when Mike Brumley hit him in the 
face with a line drive in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Although he walked off under his own power, he was taken to a hospital. When 
the swelling goes down X-rays will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth bases grand slam for Burks, who hasn't had three full seasons 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 8, New York 5 -- A couple of weeks ago the Orioles had a handful of 
challengers to worry about. Now they have one. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bob Melvin hit his first home run in more than a year and added a 
triple at New York as the Orioles completed the demise of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milacki (9-11) survived a rocky start to pitch the Orioles to their fourth 
victory in the five-game series and drop the Yankees, once a contender, 13 1/2 
games out of first place in the East. The Yankees, mired in sixth place, have 
only 30 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin, who tripled in a run in the seventh, wanted to talk about Milacki, who 
went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched a great game," he said. "He didn't deserve to give up five runs. It 
was my fault. I called for too many fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Milwaukee 4 -- The Blue Jays are the team the Orioles haven't been 
able to shake. With George Bell on a hitting binge, the Blue Jays are 1 1/2 
games out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, in extending his hitting streak to 18 games, hit a two-run triple to 
climax a five-run fifth inning at Toronto that gave the Blue Jays their sixth 
consecutive victory. By sweeping the three-game series, the Blue Jays have 
dropped the Brewers into fourth place, 6 1/2 games behind the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Brock's two-run home run climaxed a third inning rally that gave the 
Brewers a 3-0 lead. A bases-loaded infield hit by hot-hitting Mookie Wilson got 
the Blue Jays on the scoreboard in the fifth, then Kelly Gruber doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Robin Yount got to Bell's long high fly, but he couldn't hold it 
and the Blue Jays were in front, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the season Toronto fans have been booing Bell. Not anymore. They cheer 
his every move. 
</P>
<P>
"George is going real well right now and he's been a big part of our success 
lately," Gruber said. "Those are the things we expect of him." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, Cleveland 3 -- The White Sox swept the three-game series at 
Cleveland and probably ended any hopes the Indians had of winning the East. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Ron Karkovice hit a grand slam to cap a six-run third inning that 
turned the game into a rout and dropped the Indians 9 1/2 games out of first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Seattle 5 -- John Moses had two hits in a seven-run fifth inning 
rally at Minneapolis and the Twins handed the stumbling Mariners their 11th 
defeat in a row. The Twins won their fifth in a row and moved above .500. DAN

PETE ROSE IS OUT, BUT FOR HOW LONG?; 
</P>
<P>
 COMMENTARY 
</P>

<P>
We know where Pete Rose is now. Nowhere. (Unless he's snuck onto the Home 
Shoppers Network with special limited-edition collector's plates commemorating 
nostalgic highlights of his career, like his .44-game hitting streak, his 4,256 
hits and some of his favorite Pik Six winners.) He's out of baseball. And out 
of luck. 
</P>
<P>
That's now. 
</P>
<P>
But where will he be in time? 
</P>
<P>
The questions most often asked about Rose are: Will he ever get back into 
baseball? And, will he make the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Let's take the Hall of Fame question first, because it's a no-brainer. The 
"Character clause" in the voting was stuck in there for public relations value. 
If you cleared the Hall of Fame of drunks, reprobates, racists, tax dodgers and 
slobs, you could fit the remaining busts in a broom closet. For 22 seasons as a 
major league player Rose was the embodiment of all baseball holds most dear. He 
was its hearts, its grit and its hustle. We're not electing someone to the 
House of Representatives, we're confirming his ability to hit a baseball. If 
Pete Rose isn't in the Hall of Fame, they ought to burn it down. 
</P>
<P>
Now, will he return to baseball? And by "baseball" we are not talking about 
going to the proposed Ump de Trump Baseball League or to Japan. Will Pete Rose 
get back in major league baseball, A. Bartlett Giamatti's baseball league? 
</P>
<P>
Professor Giamatti, the Ivory Tower Executioner, has had his say. Yes, said 
Giamatti, I have concluded Mr. Rose bet on baseball. And yes, declared 
Giamatti, glaring out from forbidding racoon(CQ?), Rose is banned for life. Let 
him apply for readmittance until Great Birnan wood comes to high Dunsinane hill 
-- it will be unavailing, the professor scornfully implied. Giamatti was smug 
in his presentation, contemptuous not only of Rose but also of the media 
seeking to understand his ruling. There's an Italian word for this demeanor -- 
"superbo," which translates as great haughtiness. 
</P>
<P>
I'd rather not tie my wagon to Rose's character. I think he's more or less a 
slug. (Though I'm amused at the caravan of baseball writers who have been so 
quick to scrape him off their shoes after 20 years of unstinting praise.) There 
may be rougher times ahead for Rose, with the ongoing IRS investigation and the 
possibility of prison. But in this matter of Rose's lifetime ban from professor 
Giamatti's Chaucer and Chewing Tobacco Club, does the punishment fit the crime? 
</P>
<P>
Did Rose fix games? No. 
</P>
<P>
Did he kill someone? No. 
</P>
<P>
Is he part of a discernible conspiracy? No. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's rule to banish for life people who gambled on their own team was 
established almost 70 years ago. Baseball was drastically different then in the 
pre-Ruth, pre-West, pre-TV days. Hardly a national sport, the Black Sox scandal 
forced baseball to struggle with a true crisis of confidence. The commissioner, 
appointed in a panic to placate the public, was expected to be dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
But to those who claim Rose has undermined the game, I ask: How? Attendance is 
rock solid. This is no scandal. There's no crisis of confidence, no doubt of 
the game's veracity. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Rose hasn't been found to have a bet on his team. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't even been found to have bet on baseball at all. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by Rose and Giamatti is clear: " ... and the commissioner 
will not make any formal finding or determinations on any matter without 
limitation the allegation that Peter Edward Rose bet on any Major League 
Baseball game." Forget what Bart The Smart said. As in his letter to the judge 
canonizing Rose's chief accuser, pay attention to what he signed. 
</P>
<P>
When Rose applies for reinstatement, Giamatti can turn him down. And he can 
keep turning him down. But in the absence of a formal finding that Rose bet on 
the Reds, how long can this go on? Reading the agreement, it appears that Rose 
has been banished for life for illegal sports betting (as he admits doing), and 
for associating with known gamblers (as seems obvious) -- rule violations that 
in past administrations have elicited limited suspensions. How many rejections 
can Giamatti issue until it will seem that the only reason he keeps dismissing 
Rose is out of meanness? 
</P>
<P>
So, what can Rose do to hasten the swell of public opinion to his side? The way 
the agreement is written, even if Rose bet on baseball there's no reason to 
admit it. Most people. me included, believe he bet. But it's off the table. One 
savvy step Rose could take is to undergo counseling for gambling. I don't know 
if Rose is addicted to gambling. He says he's not. But Rose faces Catch-22. As 
soon as someone denies being an addict, 10,000 pop psychologists scream, "Aha! 
Denial! The sure sign of the addictive personality." (I resent the rush to 
medicalize all social problems; we're too enamored with the pitiful romance of 
addictions.) Even if he isn't, and he's just going through the motions for the 
PR benefit, but particularly if he's a pathological gambler, Rose would be wise 
to seek therapy; it's the welcome mat back for alcohol and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's supporters describe him as a compassionate man who has anguished 
over The Rose Affair. He has the chance to show this compassionate side. If he 
believes in rehabilitation (although Rose appears unreconstructed by denying he 
bet on baseball, he did demonstrate marginal remorse by admitting he "made some 
mistakes"), if Giamatti believes in the better side of man, he can hold out the 
olive branch to Rose. Show Rose the door is closed, but not locked. In three 
years -- providing Rose has been a model citizen -- Giamatti should let him 
back into baseball. He'd be a neat broadcaster. And the next season George 
Steinbrenner, who knows a thing or two about convictions and suspensions, will 
hire him to manage the Yankees.

MICHIGAN SEEKS FIRST TITLE FOR BIG TEN SINCE '68 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo is back and in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
Not Bo Jackson, the super athlete, but Bo Schembechler, the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler's 224 victories are the most among active Division 1-A football 
coaches. But his image has suffered because of Michigan's miserable bowl 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Until Michigan beat USC, 22-14, last January in the Rose Bowl, 
Schembechler-coached teams had won only four of 15 bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
National championships are often won, or higher rankings attained, in the major 
bowl games, and Bo's boys usually haven't been up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Big Ten Conference teams haven't finished No. 1 in the final 
Associated Press or United Press International rankings since Ohio State was 
acclaimed by both polls in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan came close, though, in 1988, losing to eventual champion Notre Dame 
and No. 2 Miami by a total of only three points. The Wolverines were fourth 
ranked in the final polls. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't even supposed to be their year," said Iowa Coach Hayden Fry of 
Michigan's 9-2-1 record. "This was supposed to be their year. But at the end of 
last season they were the best team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Schembechler's team is ranked No. 1 by Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The crusty coach, who is also the school's athletic director, says jokingly 
that there is internal pressure on him because Michigan won the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
"In one year I turned this into a basketball school," Schembechler said. "This 
is a difficult year for the football coach at a school predominately known for 
basketball, but we will try to live up to our basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Although Schembechler has never won a national championship, he says it's not 
his primary goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like Notre Dame or Penn State that have nothing to play for except 
the national championship," he said. "Our goal is the Big Ten championship. If 
there are any Big Ten teams that shoot for a national championship, they're 
damn fools." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler might redefine his goals, however, if Michigan beats Notre Dame 
and UCLA on successive Saturdays in September. 
</P>
<P>
National championships aren't necessarily won in September, but they can be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler's reasoning that independent teams are more focused on the 
national championship than teams with conference commitments has some merit. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the last seven national champions have come from the independent ranks, 
with Miami and Penn State each winning two titles. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a new coach, Dennis Erickson, and a new quarterback, Craig Erickson 
(no relation), the Hurricanes are a factor again. 
</P>
<P>
So are Notre Dame, Nebraska, Louisiana State, USC, UCLA, Florida State, and 
Auburn, according to preseason magazines and polls. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish will be trying to become the first school to win consecutive national 
championships since AP ranked Alabama No. 1 in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
However, Coach Lou Holtz will have to cope with the loss of two key players 
because of disciplinary action, and another who transferred to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The university's Office of Student Affairs, which operates independently of the 
athletic department, has suspended All-American linebacker Michael Stonebreaker 
for his senior year and refused to allow running back Tony Brooks to re-enter 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissals were prompted by separate traffic accidents last February in 
which Stonebreaker was charged with driving under the influence and Brooks with 
leaving the scene of an accident that involved no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the university's action, Holtz said: "Do I feel remorse? Yes. Am 
I bitter at the university? No. The university has done so many great things 
and turned around so many great people. I know they have a philosophy here in 
how they operate. I trust that philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Arnold Ale, the former Carson High School defensive end, became 
homesick. Tackle George Williams was ruled academically ineligible and fullback 
Braxton Banks probably is out for the season because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
These are setbacks, to be sure, along with a schedule that has the Irish on the 
road for five of its first six games. 
</P>
<P>
So much for negative aspects. On the positive side is the return of quarterback 
Tony Rice, whose passing skill might not be comparable to his running ability 
in Holtz's wishbone portion of the offense, but it's not a drawback, either. 
</P>
<P>
He has matured as a passer and has capable receivers in Raghib (Rocket) Ismael, 
who caught a 55-yarder from Rice against USC last year, and Derek Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Watters, the team's leading receiver last year, has been switched to 
tailback, a position he played in 1987. With Brooks' departure, Watters will be 
a key player while Anthony Johnson will be used more extensively at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz also has a veteran offensive line and defensive standouts such as nose 
tackle Chris Zorich and linebacker Ned Bolcar, along with an experienced, 
talented secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is amply stocked with proven players. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michigan has only one experienced quarterback, Michael Taylor. 
Demetrius Brown, who started the final three games last season after Taylor 
suffered a broken collarbone, has dropped out of school. Brown proved himself 
by completing 11 of 24 passes for 144 yards in the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler doesn't have the insurance of having two proven quarterbacks, but 
he has one of the nation's best running-back tandems in tailback Tony Boles and 
fullback Leroy Hoard. Hoard was the most valuable player of the Rose Bowl with 
142 yards rushing, including a 61-yard run on Michigan's game-clinching, final 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines also have a strong receiving corps, a huge offensive line and 
nine defensive starters returning, although Schembechler must replace 
All-American tackle Mark Messner. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other top teams: 
</P>
<P>
MIAMI 
</P>
<P>
A new coach, Dennis Erickson and a new quarterback, Craig Erickson, would 
usually indicate a team is rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Not at Miami, which has won two national championships in the past six seasons 
and will contend for another this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I call Miami 'Re-load U.,' " said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Erickson will implement a one-back offense with a short passing game that 
worked for him at Washington State last year when Timm Rosenbach led the nation 
in passing. 
</P>
<P>
NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
Talent aside, the most favorable aspect for the Cornhuskers is their schedule 
-- non-conference games against over-matched Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota 
and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Only Colorado and Oklahoma should challenge Nebraska in the the Big Eight and 
the Sooners, on NCAA probation, don't appear as formidable as they once were. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to be decent, but we won't be overwhelming," Nebraska Coach 
Tom Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne noted that Nebraska has lost 11 all-conference selections, including 
quarterback Steve Taylor and All-American linebacker Broderick Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Nebraska has its usual quota of talented players, most notably 
tailback Ken Clark and Doug Glaser, a 6-foot-7, 295-pound offensive tackle. The 
schedule should make up for any shortcomings Nebraska has in experience. 
</P>
<P>
LOUISIANA STATE 
</P>
<P>
In Tommy Hodson, the Tigers have, arguably, the nation's best quarterback. His 
statistics were down slightly last year, but he led LSU on late scoring drives 
to beat Auburn and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Archer has eight returning starters to support Hodson on offense, 
but there are some gaps to be filled on defense. 
</P>
<P>
LSU shared the Southeastern Conference championship with Auburn in 1988, its 
second co-championship in three years. 
</P>
<P>
AUBURN 
</P>
<P>
Even though Coach Pat Dye has lost eight starters from the nation's No. 1 
defense, it's difficult to dismiss the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn is the team of the 1980s in the SEC, with three appearances in the Sugar 
Bowl in the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Dye's defense needs some mending, but the offense is solid, featuring All-SEC 
quarterback Reggie Slack and running backs Stacy Danley and James Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn lost Outland Trophy winner Tracy Rocker, but his younger brother, David, 
will be trying to carry on the family tradition at defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles are in a rut with consecutive 11-1 seasons, losing only to rival 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Bowden has lost such outstanding players as running back Sammie 
Smith and cornerback Deion Sanders, he says his program has progressed to the 
point where he has capable backups for most of his departed players. 
</P>
<P>
For example, fifth-year senior Peter Tom Willis threw four touchdown passes 
against South Carolina in his only start last season while standing in for 
quarterback Chip Ferguson. Another backup last year, tailback Dexter Carter, 
gained 330 yards as a replacement for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule, as usual, is brutal. 
</P>
<P>
"We play eight teams that were in bowls last year," Bowden said, "and that 
might be too much for us." 
</P>
<P>
Some things remain the same. Joe Paterno returns for his 24th season at Penn 
State, but four other schools with big-time programs have new coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson went from Miami to the Dallas Cowboys with Erickson as his 
replacement. Oklahoma's Barry Switzer and Texas A&amp;M's Jackie Sherrill left 
schools after allegations of infractions, and Georgia's Vince Dooley retired 
after 25 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer, Sherrill and Dooley were each replaced by an assistant: Gary Gibbs at 
Oklahoma, R.C. Slocum at Texas A&amp;M and Ray Goff at Georgia. Slocum was an 
assistant at USC in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there are the inevitable rules changes. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed over the increase in scoring because of field goals, the NCAA Rules 
Committee banned the use of tees on field goals and point-after-touchdown 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In other rules changes, the ball will be blown dead if a player pretends to 
drop his knee near to the ground and then stands up running or throwing. 
</P>
<P>
Players who point fingers, arms, or hands at an opponent will be charged with 
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was clarified as to sticking out one's tongue.

<P>
College football's vagabond coach has turned up this season at Miami, 
inheriting a highly visible program that was left temporarily without a leader 
last spring when Jimmy Johnson departed to coach the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Erickson, formerly a Washington State coach who is starting over for 
the third time in four years, seems to have warmed to his latest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
At Miami, Erickson will have a legitimate chance to compete for the nation's 
most highly regarded recruits. His teams will be favored to win most of their 
games. They'll have a realistic shot at winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
From all indications, this is the situation Erickson laid out for a reporter 
last year when asked to describe his ideal job. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it," he said. "In college football, it's one of the best 
jobs in the country." 
</P>
<P>
In college football. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the Hurricanes have played a single game under their new coach, 
a national magazine has said Erickson is out of his element and that he belongs 
in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not my goal right now," Erickson said, "but nothing is etched in 
granite, either." 
</P>
<P>
With Erickson, it never is. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has never been fired, this is his fourth head-coaching job in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Only last spring, after leading Washington State to the first top 20 finish in 
its history, Erickson said of the coaching vacancy at Miami: "I am not 
interested in that job." 
</P>
<P>
Only two years before that, he left Wyoming without ever returning to campus to 
explain his decision to his players. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, he left a trail of hostility and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, 42, called himself a "young idiot" for the way he handled the jump 
from Wyoming to Washington State, but he finds it curious that anyone would 
question his latest move. 
</P>
<P>
"I had opportunities to leave Washington State, other than this, and didn't 
even think about them," he said. "I really liked Washington State, but when you 
have a chance to go to one of the top programs in the country . . . " 
</P>
<P>
His voice trailed off, but the message was clear: Wouldn't anybody have made 
the same jump? 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's road to Miami led through Pasadena, where last October Washington 
State overcame a 21-point third-quarter deficit to upset previously unbeaten 
and No. 1-ranked UCLA, 34-30. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the highlight of a 9-3 season during which Washington State, 
which hadn't won as many games since 1930, finished third in the nation in 
total offense and beat Houston, 24-22, in the Aloha Bowl for its first bowl 
victory in 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a lot to do with where I'm sitting right now," Erickson said of the 
nationally televised victory over UCLA. "All the things we were trying to build 
into that program came together in that game." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson was in demand. 
</P>
<P>
He had led Idaho to a 32-15 record in four seasons. Then, taking over a Wyoming 
team that was coming off a 3-8 season, he pulled the Cowboys to .500 in 1986. 
Washington State was only 3-7-1 in his first season, but last season the 
Cougars ranked near the top of the Pacific 10 Conference in several offensive 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Erickson even more popular is that he produces exciting, wide-open 
offensive teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney, who coached Erickson at Montana State and later 
hired him as an assistant coach at Fresno State, calls his former prodigy, 
"Flat out, the best young coach in the country." 
</P>
<P>
That opinion was shared by Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich, a former 
Washington State athletic director, who made an unpopular choice by wooing 
Erickson instead of giving the job to Gary Stevens, the Hurricanes' offensive 
coordinator under Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who is now the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins, adapted 
the pro-style attack that was described by Johnson as "the most exciting 
college offense in the country" and made millionaires of quarterbacks Jim 
Kelly, Bernie Kosar, Vinny Testaverde and Steve Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Walsh, who led Miami to a 23-1 record in the last two seasons, said 
that he would give up his final year of eligibility if Stevens didn't get the 
job, but Jankovich was undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted someone with head-coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this program is at the stage where it can take a chance of 
having someone learn at our expense, especially in a competitive marketplace," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, Jankovich said, "has a lot of the same characteristics, at the same 
stage, of a Jimmy Johnson -- great compatibility within the coaching staff and 
a (reputation as a) players' coach." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, in fact, is a personable, likable man, despite the reputation he made 
for himself with the ill-advised handling of his departure from Wyoming, which 
the coach himself described as a "goofy mess." 
</P>
<P>
When his Wyoming players left campus for Christmas break, Erickson assured them 
he would be there when they returned. But when they got back, he was gone. 
Hired by Washington State at a coaches convention in San Diego, Erickson did 
not return to Wyoming on the advice of his wife, Marilyn, who told him of death 
threats that had been made against him. She took several threatening phone 
calls, she said, and a rock was thrown through a window in the family's 
university-owned home two blocks from the Laramie campus. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, who never returned to collect his belongings, has since apologized 
for his handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wake up at night in a cold sweat, thinking about what I did," he said 
last spring. "I didn't leave the right way. I was a young idiot. I didn't do it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
His former players called him a traitor. And worse. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Washington State, the native of Everett, Wash., told 
reporters: "I was born and raised in the state. It's home and that's the No. 1 
thing. I've been a Cougar all my life. I love it here and this is where I want 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
After Erickson left two years later, Washington State Athletic Director Jim 
Livengood said in an interview with the Spokane Spokesman-Review that the 
former coach and his staff weren't as "focused" on academics as they should 
have been, revealing that the football team's cumulative grade-point average 
during the fall semester last year was 1.94. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way of saying this (and not have it) come off as sounding like the 
coaches didn't care, which is not the case," Livengood told the newspaper. 
"They did care. But it wasn't to the extent, at least, that I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said that his players, unprepared for the success enjoyed by the 
Cougars last season, lost sight of their academic objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"We got into a season that doesn't happen there very often and got caught up in 
winning and going to a bowl game," he said. "The players lost sight of what 
they had to do academically. I don't think you can put that all on my back." 
</P>
<P>
Pausing for a moment, he said: "But, obviously it's my fault because I was the 
head coach." 
</P>
<P>
At Miami, Erickson came in and scrapped the offense, raising suspicion among 
his new players, who also were concerned that Erickson might put an end to 
their showboating, let-us-intimidate-you style. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson apparently alleviated their fears last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh left for the National Football League midway through spring practice, but 
the more mobile Craig Erickson, who is not related to his new coach, may be 
better suited to Erickson's offense, which features motion and keeps the 
quarterback on the move. 
</P>
<P>
Said Craig Erickson, noting that Washington State's Timm Rosenbach led the 
nation last season in passing efficiency: "There's a lot of good opportunities 
in (the offense) for a quarterback, throwing in the seams. It features a 
strong-armed quarterback with quick feet, and I think I fit that role fairly 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson learned the basic components of his offense at San Jose State, where 
he was the offensive coordinator for three seasons under Coach Jack Elway. 
Elway had picked it up from Jack Neumeier, John Elway's coach at Granada Hills 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson refined it at Idaho and has used it since. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining its success, Erickson said: "When you spread people all over the 
field, (the other team) has to dictate what it's going to do to you 
defensively." 
</P>
<P>
What Miami will continue to do defensively is intimidate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more for that than any of us," wide receiver Dale Dawkins said of his new 
coach. "He wants to just go out and get the job done. It don't matter how we do 
it -- just get it done. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people said there's not going to be all that taunting and 
finger-pointing. (But) You can't take that away from us. That's just the way we 
play. That's what we're used to doing and we play better that way." 
</P>
<P>
That's not entirely true, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in taunting and pointing fingers," he said. "You won't see 
that at Miami. However, what you will see are guys having a lot of fun and if 
we make a great play, they're going to jump up and down. They're going to be 
excited about making a great hit because that's what football is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson isn't expected to rule with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came in, he said he wasn't here to stick us down with a 100-page rule 
book," said offensive tackle Mike Sullivan. "He said, 'All we want to do is 
keep winning.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miami, of course, expects to be in a bowl game, possibly playing for the 
national championship. Expectations are high. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, linebacker Bernard Clark told a Miami reporter: "We don't want to 
go through another season like last year. We don't want to lose ever again." 
</P>
<P>
Clark referred to a season during which the Hurricanes were 11-1, losing by 
only a point to Notre Dame, and wound up No. 2 in the polls after beating 
Nebraska, 23-3, in the Orange Bowl. In the last three seasons, Miami was 34-2, 
including 12-0 in 1987, when it won the national championship for the second 
time in five seasons. The Hurricanes, who have lost only four times in four 
seasons, have won 42 of their last 43 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, however, jokes that he is reminded almost every day that only three 
things are expected of him: 
</P>
<P>
1) Beat Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
2) Beat Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
3) Go undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the program to where it is has been a great achievement," Erickson 
said. "The next achievement will be to keep it at that level. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot of people watching to see where we go. There's pressure. 
(But) I knew what the expectations would be." 
</P>
<P>
In five seasons under Johnson, Miami was 52-9. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson might be as successful, but he will go about his business less 
flamboyantly than his predecessor. Describing himself as "very, very intense," 
Erickson said that he tends to internalize his feelings. While at Idaho he 
hyperventilated during a halftime speech and fainted in front of his players. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, I haven't got an ulcer," he said. "I've given my wife one, but I don't 
have one." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his wife brings Maalox to every game. She woke up on the morning of 
last season's Washington State-Arizona State game with an ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
If she gets that worked up for Arizona State, she might need extra medicine if 
Miami plays Notre Dame for the national championship Nov. 25 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve starters return, including six from a defense that ranked second in the 
nation last season. Johnson's last recruiting class was said to be his best and 
the schedule, before a showdown against Florida State Oct. 28 at Tallahassee, 
is favorable. The Hurricanes' first six opponents won only 22 of 68 games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds so good that Erickson might even stick around for a while. His 
five-year contract imposes stiff financial penalties if he tries to break it. 
Will he be around when it expires? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," he said. But he can't say for sure.

The National Football League has refused reinstatement this season for Mossy 
Cade, the former Green Bay Packers' defensive back who served 15 months in 
prison for second-degree sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's decision was made several months ago but not announced, the Milwaukee 
Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
Cade was paroled from prison Oct. 21, 1988. He tried unsuccessfully to play 
last year after his release. 
</P>
<P>
Cade's attorney, Randy Rueckert, said he and Cade had hoped a new commissioner 
would be in place by training camp this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my impression that as long as Pete Rozelle is commissioner he (Cade) is 
not going to be able to play in the NFL," Rueckert said.

Dave Johnson of the United States clinched the decathlon gold medal in the 
final event at the World University Games Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson trailed Mikhail Medved of the Soviet Union by 11 points before the 
1,500-meter race, the final event of the two-day competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the hardest I've ever worked in my life," said Johnson, of Montclair, 
Calif. "I was scared to death. I knew I had to run at my best or even better to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson posted a time of 4 minutes 32.72 seconds in the 1,500. That gave him 
727 points for a winning total of 8,216, 154 more than Medved. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet had a time of 4:59.60 in the race, worth 562 points, and ended up 
second with a total of 8,062. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson leads the world decathlon rankings this year with 8,549 points. "I 
always go out to give 100%, but the weather conditions stopped me from having a 
better score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Blockburger of the U.S. was third going into the last event. But he was 
overtaken by Dezso Szabo of Hungary and had to settle for fourth place at 
7,906. Szabo clinched the bronze with 8,031. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good going into the race, but my legs just gave out," said Blockburger, 
who had the slowest 1,500 time and earned only 569 points in the final event. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic steeplechase champion Julius Kariuki of Kenya, running the distance for 
the first time this year, won the men's 10,000-meter race, while the Romanian 
team earned six gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Romania's golds came in rowing and two in track and field, one of them 
from Olympic champion Paula Ivan, who set a meet record in winning the women's 
3,000-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Davis won the gold and Kevin Henderson took the bronze for the U.S. in 
the men's 400-meter intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, of Tallahassee, Fla., breezed home in the hurdles in 49.74 seconds. 
Vladimir Budko of the Soviet Union was a distant second in 50.30, with 
Henderson, of Auburn, Ala., third in 50.57. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some problems recently with disqualifications, but this time it was OK," 
Davis said. "I wanted this title and a meet record, but the weather spoiled my 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
Kariuki, who won the gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Games in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase, beat out Zeki Oeztuerk of Turkey to win the 10,000 in the slow 
time of 28:35.46. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran to win and didn't worry about the time," Kariuki said. "I'm in good 
condition and it's not a problem to run either the steeplechase or the 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan, the Olympic 1,500-meter champion and silver medalist at 3,000 meters, won 
the gold in the 3,000 in 8:44.09, bettering her meet record of 8:53.61 set in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Quirot of Cuba cruised to victory in the women's 400 meters in a slow 
50.73, ahead of Jearl Miles of the U.S. at 52.41. 
</P>
<P>
Quirot posted a meet record of 50.01 in Saturday's heats, fastest in the world 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Miles, of Jacksonville, Fla., said she tried to conserve her strength for the 
final 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to waste too much energy on the backstretch and concentrated on 
giving a big burst on the home stretch," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Jefferson of Cuba won the men's long jump at 26 feet, 2 1/4 inches. 
Vladimir Ratoushkov of the Soviet Union was second at 26-1 1/2, followed by 
Llewellyn Starks of the U.S. at 25-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Galina Astafei of Romania, the world junior champion, upset Silvia Costa of 
Cuba in the women's high jump. Both cleared 6-3 1/4 but Astafei won on fewer 
misses.

BEUERLEIN MIGHT START; CHRISTENSEN, LOFTON MIGHT BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are rumbles of a shakeup in silver and blackdom, where the 0-3 Raiders 
are preparing to cut their squad to 60 by Tuesday. They involve several of the 
team's biggest names, who could be benched or waived. 
</P>
<P>
Starting from the top: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders might start Steve Beuerlein in Saturday's exhibition finale 
against the Chicago Bears and bench Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein has completed 59.5% of his passes and has looked sharp and 
aggressive. Schroeder is at 43.4% and described by some team officials as 
"tentative." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Shanahan, Schroeder's leading supporter and wary of starting a 
quarterback controversy, was noncommittal Sunday, praising Beuerlein but 
expressing confidence in Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has had the burden of trying to establish the Marcus Allen-less 
running game, which has failed miserably. Beuerlein has had the advantage of 
coming in second, by which time he knows it isn't working and can go for broke. 
However, a growing number of Raider officials want to see what would happen if 
Beuerlein starts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Todd Christensen and James Lofton could go in this, the first cut. 
</P>
<P>
Neither played Saturday, although both were healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan used Mike Dyal, Trey Junkin, Ethan Horton and Charles Henry at tight 
end ahead of Christensen. Shanahan prefers bigger, blocker-type tight ends. 
Christensen is 33, makes $750,000 and probably won't be retained if he doesn't 
figure as a starter, which he doesn't. A five-time All-Pro, he is the team's 
all-time leader at the position in receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton is 33, has been running third string in camp, has one catch in 
exhibitions and has been eclipsed by second-year player Mike Alexander, a tall, 
rangy receiver like himself. The Raiders have already paid Lofton a $400,000 
reporting bonus, but remain on the hook for his $325,000 salary if he makes the 
club. He is a seven-time All-Pro and a Hall of Fame candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matt Millen is on his way out. 
</P>
<P>
It could be today or next week, but he wasn't benched Saturday merely because 
someone was curious about Jackie Shipp. 
</P>
<P>
Shipp was unimpressive (the Oilers rushed for 198 yards, so who wasn't?), but 
he was only a stand-in for the real candidate to take Millen's strong-side 
inside linebacker spot, Jerry Robinson. Robinson, previously the weak-side 
inside linebacker, has been sidelined because of a groin pull but is expected 
back this week. 
</P>
<P>
Millen has told friends that the coaches have already informed him that they 
are trying to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Haynes is still up to his neck in competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Washington has performed well in exhibitions and might start on the 
right side, with Mike Richardson or Terry McDaniel on the left side when the 
season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes has veteran's disease: he is 36 and would make $825,000 this season. If 
he doesn't start, the Raiders aren't likely to pay him that much to come off 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
And which of the younger players are in trouble? 
</P>
<P>
 -- All of the running backs. Vance Mueller, who wanted a chance to show what 
he could do, has failed. Last week's boomlets for Derrick Gaynor and Kerry 
Porter are over. 
</P>
<P>
The coaching staff desperately wants Allen to return. Allen has said he yearns 
to return. Until all this yearning is requited, the Raider running game (2.7 
yards per carry) exists in theory only.

Got a spare $1 million you want to spend for a used car? 
</P>
<P>
Today's your big chance to pick up a Mercedes-Benz 600 Presidential Landaulet 
-- one of only 59 made by Mercedes-Benz -- at an auction in Reseda. The car, 
which has 43,000 miles on it, is being sold by Car 88 Inc., an exporter and 
importer of specialty cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dealership paid about $800,000 for the car, the starting bid will 
be $1 million. And Car 88 executives expect to fetch up to $1.5 million for the 
champagne car, which was previously owned by a French race car driver. 
Identical versions of the car are owned by rock star David Bowie, the Prime 
Minister of Romania, Queen Elizabeth and even the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the car worth so much money? "For one thing," said Juergen Viek, 
vice president of Car 88, "it's the best limousine ever built." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alterations at Bullock's 
</P>
<P>
Change is a constant at Bullock's these days. 
</P>
<P>
R. H. Macy &amp; Co. is continuing "the gradual process of streamlining" 
operations at the Southern California department store chain that it bought 
last year, according to Kathleen A. Waugh, a spokeswoman for Macy's 
South/Bullock's in Atlanta. A handful of jobs were recently eliminated in 
personnel, security and operations because they duplicated functions performed 
in Atlanta. In addition, about 15 employees in such positions were assigned to 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
And another executive will soon head to the headquarters office in Atlanta, 
which has responsibility for Macy's stores in the Southeast and Texas as well. 
Duane V. Johnson, 39, who has been senior vice president of personnel for 
Bullock's, has been promoted to that post for all of Macy's South/Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Homes and P.R. 
</P>
<P>
Genshiro Kawamoto is the Japanese billionaire and real estate speculator who 
did not make many fans in Hawaii in 1987 and 1988 when he went on a home-buying 
binge all over Honolulu. In all, he bought 179 homes for use as rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Kawamoto says, he wants to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to build 2,000 rental and for-sale homes on the island of Oahu -- even 
though he expects to lose money on the project -- in an effort to alleviate the 
backlash against Japanese investors in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamoto said he is willing to lose money because it will be "very satisfying" 
to ease the island's housing shortage, adding that the project would also help 
reverse "the stereotyped image" that the Japanese have in the islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More in Store at Wal-Mart 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart Stores, which has grown huge by retailing to small-town America, has 
announced further sites for California stores. The big discounter, based in 
Bentonville, Ark., plans a summer, 1990, opening in Lancaster, to be followed 
in the fall by a debut in El Centro, near the Mexican border. Each store will 
create about 245 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 1,316-store chain said it would open stores next year in Stockton, 
Madera and Elk Grove. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to estimate how many 
locations the company eventually hopes to have in California. "We'll announce 
them as they come along," she said. But it's a good bet there will be plenty 
more of Wal-Mart's "Coming Soon" signs popping up.

U.S. LOOKS TO TALKS TO END 'SANCTIONED COLLUSION' IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Entrepreneur R. Terren Dunlap thought that he had an idea for a product that 
couldn't fail: a dual-deck videocassette recorder, one that would allow 
America's couch potatoes to tape two television programs at once or to dub 
their own movies. 
</P>
<P>
When Dunlap tried to convert his brainstorm into reality four years ago, 
however, he ran into an obstacle that he calls "the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap claims that Japan's VCR manufacturers, who dominate the United States 
and global markets and hold essential patents for home video devices, got 
together and decided that his dual-deck VCR would be bad for the industry. They 
shut him out in the process, he says, making it impossible for his Go-Video 
Inc., based in Scottsdale, Ariz., to obtain the technology necessary to start 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing collusion and injustice, Dunlap did what any indignant American might 
-- he sued. 
</P>
<P>
But where? Japan does have an anti-monopoly law that it inherited, reluctantly, 
from the U.S. occupation after World War II. But virtually no recourse exists 
for a private individual to petition for its enforcement. So Dunlap went to 
federal court in Phoenix, and there he sued a passel of Japanese electronics 
firms under U.S. antitrust law, alleging that they formed an illegal cartel 
that unfairly suppressed competition. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem a mere nuisance suit going after deep pockets and treble damages, 
but Dunlap's legal battle also underscores a serious gap in capitalist cultures 
that has lurked beneath the surface of more than a decade of U.S.-Japan trade 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
An ethos of harmony and cooperation -- and sometimes collusion -- permeates the 
Japanese philosophy of fair competition, harking back to the prewar days of the 
zaibatsu conglomerates. Even today, in distribution, construction and 
manufacturing, price fixing and bid rigging are tacitly condoned by regulatory 
authorities for the sake of avoiding "confusion" in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We operate under a free enterprise system," Dunlap said in a telephone 
interview from Scottsdale, "while they operate under a cartel system." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sanctioned Collusion' 
</P>
<P>
That view may be simplistic, but legal cartels have indeed been an important 
part of the government's phenomenally successful industrial policy for the past 
60 years, helping depressed industries such as steel and petrochemicals 
restructure and bounce back into international markets. 
</P>
<P>
Kozo Yamamura, an economist at the University of Washington, summed up the 
situation when he wrote that "many segments of Japanese export-oriented 
industries have been shielded from the vagaries of market forces by sanctioned 
collusion." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Japan has emerged as a fearful economic juggernaut, however, its 
propensity for collusion is starting to attract critical attention from trading 
partners, particularly Americans, who are concerned about the lack of a level 
playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Early next month, U.S. and Japanese officials will begin a new round of talks 
called the "Structural Impediment Initiative," aimed at resolving trade 
imbalances by looking at structural problems in the economies of each country. 
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda for the American side will be Japan's lax enforcement of its 
anti-monopoly law, with the view that cartels and exclusive business ties can 
block imports and foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure from abroad, Japan's moribund Fair Trade Commission, 
the agency charged with enforcing the Occupation-vintage anti-monopoly Law, has 
recently shown some inconclusive signs of stirring to life. In July, for 
example, it warned the Beef Importers Council to disband a cartel suspected of 
parceling out allocations of controlled beef imports without competitive 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the commission imposed penalties on a cartel of 70 construction 
companies found to have rigged bids on nearly $16 million in contracts at the 
U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, between 1984 and 1987. It is 
probing allegations that eight builders conspired to make illegal 
subcontracting arrangements for landfill work at the Kansai International 
Airport, a project that has become a symbol of the U.S. government's attempt to 
pry open the closed public works market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cartel Denied 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this month it was leaked to the Asahi newspaper that Fair Trade 
Commission investigators are gathering information on a suspected cartel of VCR 
manufacturers who allegedly agreed in secret to fix prices in the domestic 
market and coordinate a reduction in production volume. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics industry sources vehemently deny that any such arrangements have 
been made, just as they have denied Go-Video's unrelated cartel allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no truth to it," said Akira Nagano, a spokesman for 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Inc., the top producer of VCRs. "The situation 
now is that competition is so fierce that there's no way we could get together 
for such a discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with exports declining after the yen appreciated dramatically three 
years ago, the domestic market has been flooded. Last year it absorbed nearly 
50% more Japanese-made VCRs than in 1984, according to data released by the 
Electronic Industries Assn. of Japan. The average factory price per unit 
declined by 52% in yen terms during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
But it is precisely under such troublesome conditions that Japanese industries 
have repeatedly shored themselves up with informal agreements aimed at defusing 
"excess competition," critics say. Just as "confusion" in the domestic market 
is a euphemism for competitive pricing, the evil of "excess competition" 
implies that there will be winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Differences 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell companies that the whole concept of 'excess competition' is 
wrong," said Shogo Itoda, deputy secretary general of the Fair Trade 
Commission. "In a free economy, there's either competition or there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Itoda laments, however, that it is extremely difficult for his agency to gather 
evidence of collusion in price cartel cases. It lacks the subpoena powers used 
by investigators in the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division. It also 
must contend with the powerful economic bureaucracies, such as the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, which sponsor legal industrial cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a well-meaning bureaucracy that doesn't have much pull in the 
Japanese government," one knowledgeable foreign observer in Tokyo said of the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Most daunting, perhaps, the commission must deal with a cultural group dynamic 
that was not anticipated or fully understood by the American drafters of the 
1947 anti-monopoly law. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a Japanese style, a mood of tacit communication," Itoda said. "When 
two people of the same industry get together, the first thing they do is form 
an association, and they quickly become very intimate. But we think it's still 
possible to compete within that framework." 
</P>
<P>
The native instinct to form cartels during uncertain times was manifested when 
the government got ready to implement, at the beginning of April, a 3% 
consumption tax on all goods and services. The first thing that it did was take 
steps to avoid "confusion" in the marketplace by allowing small businessmen to 
form temporary cartels -- 4,533, at last count. 
</P>
<P>
The concern was that a lack of coordination among vendors might result in 
volatile prices, perhaps even cut-throat competition. As a sop to the outraged 
consumer, the Fair Trade Commission installed a "cartel hot line" to take 
reports of opportunistic price hikes. Makers of tofu, or bean curd, were 
admonished to clean up their acts under the agency's non-legally binding 
"administrative guidance" procedures. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Setsuo Umezawa, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, is a 
former career bureaucrat in the Finance Ministry's tax division who assumed the 
top trust-busting post in 1987, when the ministry was drafting the package of 
tax reforms containing the highly controversial consumption levy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctions Decline 
</P>
<P>
Umezawa took office declaring his commitment to more aggressive enforcement of 
the anti-monopoly law. But so far under his tenure, the agency has continued a 
trend toward less frequent activity. In fiscal 1988, which ended March 31 of 
this year, the commission initiated 178 investigations, compared to 329 in 
fiscal 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Formal and informal sanctions taken by the agency also steadily declined during 
the six years. Last year it issued six legally binding recommendations, similar 
to cease-and-desist orders, and settled 82 cases with informal warnings and 
cautions. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has filed only one criminal complaint in its 42-year history, 
against participants in a cartel found to have rigged gasoline prices after the 
first oil shock of the 1970s. In that case, the Supreme Court eventually upheld 
convictions and suspended sentences for 13 company executives. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the agency making full use of the enforcement teeth granted by a 
revision of the law in 1977. Although it has taken advantage of the power to 
levy surcharges on cartels, it has not once exercised its expanded authority to 
order the break up of monopoly enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2-Million Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Umezawa, in a speech last month, attributed the decline in anti-monopoly 
investigations over the past decade to more stable economic conditions, 
effective deterrence and better attitudes among companies, not lax enforcement. 
Asked if he is sympathetic to calls to toughen the law, he said "there's no 
need to strengthen it beyond this." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap of Go-Video, meanwhile, has found a way around the alleged VCR cartel 
while pursuing his antitrust lawsuit. He has settled out of court with several 
defendants for a total of about $2 million and has worked out an arrangement 
with Samsung, one of South Korea's zaibatsu-style conglomerates, to manufacture 
his dual-deck machine later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung was originally named in the suit for abiding by a Japanese "voluntary 
restraint" agreement not to make dual-head VCRs. Dunlap's lawyer, Joseph Alioto 
of San Francisco, contends that this was part of a "conspiracy" aimed at 
keeping American companies out of consumer electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game of the Japanese isn't market share, it's market control," 
Alioto said. "They want to have it all."

FACE LIFT AT FREDERICK'S; 
</P>
<P>
A SHIFT TO LESS KINKY AND MORE MAINSTREAM MERCHANDISE IS PAYING OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ooh-la-la. Things are really shaping up at Frederick's of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the bottom line of the legendary purveyor of naughty lingerie 
was sagging like an old fan dancer's fanny. 
</P>
<P>
The company -- famous for its passionately purple Art Deco flagship store on 
Hollywood Boulevard -- reported the first annual loss ($148,000) since its 1946 
founding. Without adequate computers, merchants were failing to follow changing 
tastes. Sales stagnated as the company's reputation for the raunchy kept 
mainstream business away; customers flocked instead to competitor Victoria's 
Secret and other stores deemed "more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Now, after several nips and tucks in its tattered strategy, Frederick's has 
bounced back -- with surging profits, remodeled stores, sophisticated 
merchandising and distribution, and a cleaned-up approach that is downright 
demure compared to the "missiles and snow cones" look of yore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now soft and sensual compared to harsh and sexual," said George Townson, 
a former Carter Hawley Hale Stores executive who was brought in four years ago 
to fix the problems. He succeeded founder Frederick Mellinger as chairman and 
chief executive and gets much of the credit for the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be associated with the old words -- sleazy, tawdry, tacky. 
They really offend us." 
</P>
<P>
All he has to do, he acknowledged in a recent interview in his basement office 
at the 54-year-old Hollywood Boulevard building, is convince everybody that 
Frederick's has changed. 
</P>
<P>
For shareholders, there has already been ample evidence that the new-found 
Frederick's beauty isn't only skin deep. In July, the company declared its 
second 3-for-2 stock split in six months. Frederick's stock, traded on the 
American Stock Exchange, has more than doubled in price this year, climbing 
steadily to a Friday close of $16.125. 
</P>
<P>
"Our shareholders are a bunch of happy campers," Townson quipped. (Founder 
Mellinger's family still owns about 60% of the stock.) 
</P>
<P>
Also last month, the company reported that profit for the third quarter tripled 
to $607,000 and that sales rose 29% to $20 million. For the nine months, sales 
increased 23% to $60.8 million, and earnings reached a record $2.3 million, 
topping the $1.7 million for all of fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
By one projection, Frederick's could surpass $3 million in earnings and $78 
million in sales for the year that ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Townson "has really taken the company to new heights," said David S. Leibowitz, 
an analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York who has followed the 
company for almost a decade. "Most observers would not have thought it possible 
looking at the company he inherited." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the face lift by Townson and his hand-picked management team -- 90% of 
whom came from outside -- permeate the company. Among the more obvious changes 
are better-quality merchandise, more tasteful store designs and fixtures, 
high-powered IBM computers to track sales and an updated logo with a stylized 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick's catalogues, which as recently as 1985 featured the theme "Dress for 
Sex-cess," no longer offer the whips, vibrators, X-rated videos, bondage 
get-ups, his-and-her Halloween devil costumes and nudity that had been 
mainstays. In place of line drawings and risque photos of models are glossy 
color pictures of wholesome looking women posing daintily, covering up any 
parts that might offend. 
</P>
<P>
Once a staple of the back pages of Hustler and Penthouse, Frederick's ads have 
shifted to Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
The idea may still be to get men's pulses racing, but the approach is less 
blatantly suggestive. 
</P>
<P>
In the stores, burgundy, brass and gold have given way to mauve, chrome and 
soft lighting. Backdrops inside the display windows that once hid shoppers from 
view have been taken down, replaced by inviting glass fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Harsh mannequins are gone, as are the sportswear, wigs and swimwear that once 
took up much of the selling floor. (Sportswear, dresses and swimwear are still 
sold through the catalogues.) Instead, Frederick's stores now sell a broader 
array of intimate apparel under the Frederick's label that is, in Townson's 
view, "a lot closer to middle of the road than four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Townson, 48, has spent much time on tour, touting the new image to 
investment analysts and trying to dispel the notion among mall developers that 
Frederick's stores should be relegated to out-of-the-way wings in shopping 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Expansion Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Developers are noticing. Steve Rausch, vice president of leasing for Macerich 
Co. in Los Angeles, said Frederick's remodeling and remerchandising of a store 
at Lakewood Center Mall have boosted sales by nearly 50% in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a place where women shopped for novelties -- the stylish, kinky, 
extraordinary," he said. "Now women are going there for everyday lingerie 
needs, too." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking charge, Townson has shut down about 30 older-generation stores (in 
some cases because developers refused to renew leases) while undergoing an 
aggressive expansion of stores with the new look. The company now operates 151 
Frederick's stores and eight upscale Private Moments stores in 35 states. It 
plans to open new Frederick's locations at the rate of 24 a year. 
</P>
<P>
While new stores are contributing to growth, sales gains at stores open at 
least a year have been running at a healthy 15%. Townson is particularly proud 
that the expansion and remodeling are being funded without borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mail-order sales have tripled since 1985 and account for 37% of 
sales. Within five years, Townson expects mail order to represent 45% of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The mail-order subsidiary alone posted a 41% sales increase during the third 
quarter, primarily because of an increase in mailings. Once shunned by other 
direct marketers with customer lists to sell, Frederick's now buys from Avon 
and Spiegel and even managed recently to crack Bloomingdale's, after a pitch by 
Townson impressed executives of the high-profile chain. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Frederick's will consolidate its mail-order activities -- now 
"bursting at the seams" in three scattered locations -- in a new 
72,000-square-foot warehouse in Compton that Townson said "will allow rapid 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Younger Clientele 
</P>
<P>
Within the next two months, a $300,000 remodeling will begin on the store in 
the lurid purple landmark building on Hollywood Boulevard. Although Townson 
declined to provide many details, a prominent feature, he said, will be a 
Lingerie Hall of Fame, a successor to the "bra museum" that Frederick's 
occasionally sets up. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Frederick's, Townson, a Boston native, was chief executive of 
Tinder Box, a chain of gift stores. Previously, he spent more than eight years 
with Sunset House, a mail-order division that Carter Hawley Hale sold. 
</P>
<P>
Townson acknowledges that he and other Frederick's executives have constantly 
reassessed their strategy in the past four years. Plans to expand the small 
Private Moments chain have been put on hold. Store designs have gone through 
several refinements. A prototype store in Westminster Mall with mirrored 
columns, for example, was immediately branded as "too glitzy" and had to be 
toned down, Townson said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has counted on research by Walter K. Levy, a New York retail 
consultant, and on Townson's instincts. The executive said he spent hours 
standing outside the company's store at Del Amo Fashion Center, observing 
customers. One thing he learned was that customers were younger than 
Frederick's had believed. 
</P>
<P>
Townson said he realizes that many developers and customers still regard the 
company as "the old Frederick's." 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot of missionary work to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One shift that Frederick's isn't likely to make is a name change, an idea that 
Townson had considered to help unload the old baggage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Frederick's name is better known around the country than other retailers' 
names," Townson said, adding that the name has a 92% recognition factor in the 
Los Angeles area and probably is known to 80% of customers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The name is really gold to us."

CHARLES KNAPP AGAIN THE CENTER OF CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
HIS MORTGAGE FIRM'S STATUS IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE AFTER CLOSURE OF WEST L.A. 
OFFICE 
</P>

Charles W. Knapp -- the controversial Los Angeles financier who once headed 
Financial Corp. of America, the nation's largest savings and loan -- had big 
plans in mind when he formed Trafalgar Mortgage a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Lawrence Taggart, a former top California banking 
regulator, Trafalgar Mortgage was supposed to become a nationwide mortgage 
lender within three years through the acquisition of up to 200 small companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie wants to be one of the most substantial lenders in the country," 
Taggart said in an interview in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Taggart is gone and, according to interviews with several former 
employees, Trafalgar Mortgage is in chaos. Three of its four offices, all in 
Southern California, have been closed, leaving only a small staff in the Santa 
Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Got Paid' 
</P>
<P>
The firm recently closed an office in West Los Angeles at Wilshire Boulevard 
and Bundy Drive. Employees said in interviews that the office was as much as 
$96,000 in arrears on its $26,000-a-month rent and that the staff had not been 
paid in several weeks. The office opened only three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing ever got paid," said one disgusted former employee. "It was a horrible 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Although Knapp would not comment directly on the troubles, his spokesmen 
sharply disputed contentions that Trafalgar Mortgage is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is doing great," said attorney Terry Christensen, who said the 
firm earned $1.2 million in the first six months of 1989 and should make $2.5 
million before the year is over. (Trafalgar Mortgage and two subsidiary 
companies had a net worth of $1.72 million as of Sept. 30, 1988, according to 
company financial statements.) 
</P>
<P>
Howard A. Siegel, acting head of Trafalgar Mortgage, said the West Los Angeles 
office was closed because the managers were out of control, hiring people and 
spending money without authorization. It was "a rogue operation," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Trafalgar Mortgage's woes have cropped up almost five years to the day after 
savings and loan regulators forced Knapp to resign as chief executive of 
Financial Corp. of America, which was a publicly traded financial institution 
that owned American Savings &amp; Loan in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, now 54, resigned amid a crisis of confidence that did not end until 
American Savings lost nearly $7 billion in deposits. FCA ultimately went 
bankrupt after American Savings failed because of heavy losses on real estate 
development loans made when Knapp was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
After a quiet period that lasted only a few months, Knapp returned to the 
limelight with the announcement that he was forming a company known as 
Trafalgar Holdings as a private investment banking firm. The company chose tony 
office digs in Westwood as its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Knapp has been dogged by controversial business deals, ranging 
from an unsuccessful effort to take over a Japanese ball-bearing company to a 
soured Texas real estate development deal that has been ensnarled in 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp has also been sharply criticized, privately and publicly, by former 
partners and associates who question his business methods. "Let's just say that 
I'm not sorry that I left the company," said Mark S. Dodge, former general 
counsel at Trafalgar and FCA, who parted ways with Knapp in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp's private life has been bumpy as well. Records in Los Angeles County 
Superior Court indicate that, as of last February, he was $187,500 behind in 
support payments to his ex-wife, Brooke Knapp, a well-known aviator who set a 
world speed record for business jets in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Plans 
</P>
<P>
Brooke Knapp declined to comment for this story, while Christensen, Knapp's 
attorney, said there is a continuing dispute over how large the payments should 
be. Knapp is now married to a movie actress named Lois Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Trafalgar Mortgage, operating as a subsidiary of Trafalgar Holdings, appears to 
have been ill-starred from the outset. Its grandiose plans have been undercut 
by a shortage of capital, unfavorable market conditions and turmoil in the 
ranks of management, former employees say. 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to fund mortgage loans, then sell the loans in the secondary 
market, where they would be packaged and sold to investors as mortgage-backed 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Taggart, an early effort to provide capital for Trafalgar Mortgage 
with a $15-million private placement of stock unraveled after the stock market 
crashed in October, 1987. "The timing just wasn't right," Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart also said Trafalgar Mortgage suffered from rising interest rates, which 
hurt business last year, and by the death of trouble-shooter Robert Ciani, a 
mortgage securities and banking expert hired early this year to help Taggart 
run the company. Ciani died recently after suffering from a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart quit in late April, having tired of the daily commutes that took him 
from his home in San Diego to Trafalgar offices in Santa Ana and West Los 
Angeles. "I was driving five to six hours a day," said Taggart, who was 
commissioner for the California Department of Savings and Loan in 1983 and 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In the mortgage lending operations at the Wilshire-Bundy office, employees were 
bitter because they said they were misled by false promises and were not paid 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they were an up-and-going operation," Steven Schleppey, who was 
office manager of the West Los Angeles operation, said in an interview last 
week. "I was told later they had not funded a loan in four months." 
</P>
<P>
One employee, loan underwriter David C. (Clay) Finley, complained to the state 
labor commissioner that he had not been paid for about six weeks starting in 
mid-June. According to his complaint, he was owed $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocky Start 
</P>
<P>
The West Los Angeles operation was originally supposed to be a partnership 
between Knapp, who would pay the expenses of the business, and John D. Richter, 
who used to work for Knapp at American Savings as a district sales manager. It 
was Richter's job to hire the sales staff and generate the business. 
</P>
<P>
The offices were housed in ample space on the 10th floor of the Wilshire-Bundy 
building that had been an office of Trafalgar Securities, which had cut back 
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schleppey, the Wilshire-Bundy operation went poorly from the 
start. Bills went unpaid, supplies were impossible to get and, sources told The 
Times, Richter and Knapp disagreed heatedly about how the operations should be 
funded and organized. Richter declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp reportedly told Richter and Schleppey that he did not want to make a 
major investment in Trafalgar Mortgage because he had sustained heavy losses at 
Trafalgar Securities. According to Schleppey, Knapp said he had lost $4 million 
on those operations. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, Knapp's attorney, characterized the Los Angeles operations of 
Trafalgar Mortgage as a "short-term experiment" that did not work out because 
Richter and his staff generated no new business. 
</P>
<P>
"These are guys that in three months never booked one loan," said Christensen, 
a partner in the Century City law firm of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink 
&amp; Jacobs. He added that all the salaried employees were eventually paid. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration climaxed in mid-August when the entire Los Angeles staff of 
Trafalgar Mortgage picked up and moved to new offices in Beverly Hills, where 
the employees are operating as an affiliate of a San Jose-based mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, meanwhile, closed the offices and had the locks changed. The space 
remains vacant, though the Trafalgar name remains on the door.

ICN Joins China Venture: ICN Pharmaceuticals said it has signed a letter of 
intent to enter into a joint venture with the China National Medical Corp. to 
build and operate a drug-manufacturing plant in Shanghai. The joint venture 
between ICN and the Chinese government-owned company is valued at up to $25 
million. Panic said the project has the blessing of Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
who met with him and the project's prospective bankers earlier this week. Under 
the tentative agreement, a factory designed by ICN and built by the Chinese 
will produce the ICN drug Ribavirin.

Lower Interest Rates Boost Home Sales: Declining mortgage rates boosted sales 
of existing homes in July for the first back-to-back monthly increases this 
year, a real estate trade group said in a report. The National Assn. of 
Realtors said existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 3.40 million units in July, a 1.2% increase over revised figures for 
June that showed a 4.7% increase to 3.36 million units annually. The June-July 
improvement followed consecutive sales declines in the first five months of the 
year.

<P>
American companies selling products in Japan and other Asian countries have 
long been aware that consumers across the Pacific have different values from 
people in this country. And a forthcoming book by University of Southern 
California professor Jagdish Sheth and two co-authors may help to answer the 
critical question of exactly how they are different. 
</P>
<P>
The new book, called "Why We Buy What We Buy: A Model of Consumption Values," 
provides a general theory of consumer desires by slicing up the motives, or 
values, behind all behavior into five categories. Functional values are 
associated with quality and price of a product or service; social values relate 
to the status or identity that can be gained from using a product; emotional 
values are those related to the pleasure or sensations produced by a product; 
epistemic values satisfy the sense of adventure and curiosity, and conditional 
values are those that derive from needs created by some other value. 
</P>
<P>
All buyers, the authors say, are motivated by some mix of these values, and 
that mix remains constant for an individual consumer no matter what the product 
or service. And while the value mix will vary across any population, national 
and cultural differences are even more important than the individual 
differences, Sheth said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese consumers, for example, will be more influenced by social and 
functional values than by epistemic and emotional values, Sheth said. An 
American cigarette vendor, for example, would therefore be wise to market a 
given brand as a social symbol. 
</P>
<P>
The next phase of Sheth's research will systematically study cross-cultural 
value differences using the five categories.

MARKETING THE LAND DOWN UNDER; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN CAIN, PREMIER OF VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA, IS MAKING THE ROUNDS TO SELL 
MELBOURNE AS THE GATEWAY TO THE PACIFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Honorable John Cain, premier of the state of Victoria, Australia, 
passed through town the other day, he made a pitch to Los Angeles' chief 
executives to come invest Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the place as vibrant but expensive," Cain said in an interview after 
lunching with 10 chief executives at the California Club. He was en route to 
Puerto Rico to sell Melbourne as the site for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The city is up against Manchester, England; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Atlanta; 
Athens, and Toronto. If Melbourne wins, the Games are expected to help channel 
tourism and investment into Australia -- specifically Victoria, which is on the 
southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Cain is selling Melbourne as a gateway to the Pacific with its 24-hour port, 
the largest in the Southern Hemisphere and the 10th-largest container port in 
the world. With Australia increasingly aligning itself with its Asia-Pacific 
neighbors, Cain said his state is part of the "most dynamic market at the 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversifying Exports 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Australia has attempted to interest other Asia-Pacific countries 
in uniting to promote regional economic cooperation through a so-called Pacific 
Rim Initiative. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Bob Hawke invited 11 
countries, including the United States, to an initial meeting in Canberra in 
November to discuss the international economic and trade environment. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Australia has been restructuring its economy to be 
less dependent on commodity exports by diversifying into export-oriented 
manufacturing businesses. As part of the change, Australia has cut its 
effective corporate tax rate to 39% from 49% and liberalized some of the work 
practices of unions. 
</P>
<P>
Australia has aggressively hit the road to lure foreign investors from abroad. 
The states of Victoria and Queensland have sent their own investment missions 
abroad, and each has a trade office in Los Angeles. The Victoria Investment 
Program, for example, is targeting the United States, United Kingdom, West 
Germany and Japan as primary sources of potential investment. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the target industries are biotechnology, tourism 
facilities, advanced manufacturing and materials, and medical and scientific 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking business that capitalizes on our strengths," such as cheap 
energy and tax advantages for research and development, Cain said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Major U.S. companies, he said, have discovered Australia as a strategic base 
for Asia-Pacific operations. They include Eastman Kodak Co., B. F. Goodrich 
Co., Campbell Soup Co., Control Data Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and Philip Morris Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Applications 
</P>
<P>
One-third of U.S. investment in Australia is concentrated in Melbourne, which 
is home for 34% of Australia's manufacturing industries and 26% of Australia's 
population. Victoria's rate of growth of non-farm gross domestic product 
averaged 4.6% during the past five years compared to 4.3% for all of Australia 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom was the biggest foreign investor in Australia at the end of 
1988, with investments totaling $32.1 billion, followed by the United States 
with $28.6 billion and Japan with $19.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board reported that in 1987-1988, 
applications for investment from U.S. companies totaled $1.5 billion, divided 
evenly among manufacturing, tourism, minerals and exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Australia is also nurturing business with its Asia-Pacific neighbors. The 
Portland Aluminum Smelter, the largest industrial project with China to date, 
is a partnership involving Alcoa, the state of Victoria, First National Trust 
and China International Trust and Investment Corp. The smelter's first 
production in 1987 brought $583.2 million in export income for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Australian firms last year completed a light rail system in Hong 
Kong for the Kowloon Canton Railway Corp. worth about $216.4 million.

Direct foreign investment in Taiwan's booming stock market is still years away, 
blocked by the fast pace of the island's financial success, according to a 
senior regulatory official. 
</P>
<P>
Lu Tung-ying, vice chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said 
regulation of the securities industry had to catch up with the rapid growth of 
the market before foreigners could be allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't quite dare to say it will be within three years," Lu said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently the only way foreigners can legally invest in Taiwan is to join one 
of four funds. Its stock market has been among the world's strongest in recent 
years. The main market index recently has flirted with the 10,000 level, 
compared to 5,199 at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lu said the government realized that a further opening of the market was needed 
before Taiwan could become an international financial center, something that 
senior government officials say is their goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We want very much to be an international market, and we are working very hard 
to set up systems so our reputation as a jungle market or as a bubble market is 
erased," Lu said.

Many American executives misunderstand the social dynamics of buyer-seller 
relationships in Japan and therefore undermine their chances of selling 
products there, according to USC marketing Prof. Wesley Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a negotiating simulation conducted at USC, academic literature and 
field observations, Johnston concluded that in Japan, sellers put themselves in 
a subservient position vis-a-vis the buyer rather than maintaining the rough 
social equality prevalent in most American business relations. 
</P>
<P>
By not recognizing this social norm, Johnston said, Americans trying to sell in 
Japan often try to be friendly with their Japanese counterparts, calling them 
by their first names, for example, without realizing that this is perceived as 
an insult. They thus torpedo their chances of making a sale. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, when buying from the Japanese, American purchasing managers 
do not take advantage of their perceived superior status by bargaining hard, 
Johnston added. They thus often fail to get as good a deal as they might.

BERNIE BIRNBAUM: A 'SECRET WEAPON' AT CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1962, Dan Rather, just up from Texas, was sitting in a CBS office, the new 
guy sweating out his big break. A short, rotund man with a cigar the size of a 
trench mortar happened by. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked in, looked at me, stuck out his hand and said, 'I'm Bernie 
Birnbaum,' " Rather recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did the man who would be anchor meet the man who would be his first 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Birnbaum. Native of Brooklyn. World War II combat cameraman. Rhodes 
Scholar. And a one-time photographer of Italian starlets who called him Mr. 
Pencil because he used a pencil, not his hands, to pose them. 
</P>
<P>
Described by Charles Kuralt as "one of the secret weapons of CBS," Birnbaum has 
worked for CBS News since 1950, first as a lighting director, then as a film 
editor, then as a writer and producer. 
</P>
<P>
His journalist's credo: "Give everybody an even break." His assessment of his 
work: "I'm the picture man . . . they learn from me how important the picture 
is." 
</P>
<P>
You never see him on TV, though. He's one of the behind-the-scenes guys, a 
sturdy CBS legend who has survived wars, hostile Southern sheriffs, management 
shoot-outs and even the March Massacre of 1987, when 215 CBS News staffers got 
axed in a budget-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was because of the threat of an even larger layoff that he 
joined CBS after his postwar days in Italy as a publicity photographer of 
starlets and actors in Italian and American epics. 
</P>
<P>
He was in Hollywood then, seeking employment at a studio. A director friend, 
Clarence Brown, told him he probably could land him a job, but that there soon 
would be perhaps 1,500 layoffs in the film business. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dead-end industry," director Brown told photographer Birnbaum. He 
urged him to cast his lot with television, whose increasing audiences were 
decreasing those for films and causing the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Birnbaum: "I said, 'Television? What's that?' " 
</P>
<P>
A friend pointed him to New York, where he hooked on with CBS as a lighting 
director of shows being broadcast -- on an experimental basis -- in the living 
color that TV viewers now take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Later he became a film editor in the news division, working with the likes of 
the late Charles Collingwood; Shad Northshield, an ex-newspaperman from Chicago 
who later would create and run what now is "CBS Sunday Morning"; and Kuralt, 
who anchors that broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum first worked with Rather in Texas on the story of the Billy Sol Estes 
soybean scandal, then the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 in 
Dallas, then the civil rights marches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
His first dealings with the man who became the "CBS Evening News" anchor were 
uneasy. The Texan from hardscrabble origins distrusted New York types, felt 
they tended to be Ivy Leaguers afflicted with superiority complexes. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it wasn't all that way," Birnbaum said. "I told him I didn't go to 
Harvard or Yale, that I went to City College (of New York) at night before the 
war and to New York University after it on the GI Bill." 
</P>
<P>
They got along fine after that. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie really took me under his wing," Rather said. "He gave me very good 
counsel and advice on any number of things." In addition to being "the ultimate 
professional," Rather said, Birnbaum "holds one record that ought to be in the 
Guinness book. He has saved and made more careers, and never breathed a word of 
it, than any man who has worked in television news. 
</P>
<P>
"A correspondent gets drunk and can't finish his script, no problem. Bernie 
does it. A tape editor's wife hits him with a frying pan and he can't show up 
for work. No problem. Bernie edits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen whole hours that were total disasters a half day before air. Bernie 
says, 'Listen, get me a writer, an editor, time in a room and we'll get this 
mother on the air.' And he does." 
</P>
<P>
Kuralt said that Birnbaum also has the ability to "gain the trust of anybody 
because he genuinely is interested" and is himself trustworthy. Kuralt first 
met Birnbaum in 1960 on a series called "Eyewitness." Kuralt was the anchor and 
Birnbaum was a field producer who always, as Kuralt recalls it, seemed in 
constant motion: 
</P>
<P>
"He thought nothing of going off to Laos for a day or two, then coming back and 
covering the New Orleans school integration story." 
</P>
<P>
As with Rather, theirs is a mutual admiration society. The Kurault-Birnbaum 
dossier includes Vietnam, four "On the Road" retrospectives that Birnbaum put 
together, the short-lived "American Parade" and "Crossroads" series and the 
producer's occasional work for "CBS Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
"Kuralt's a goddamn genius," Birnbaum submits. "He writes to pictures, which 
very few people do now." 
</P>
<P>
The producer will be 69 in October, but has slowed only slightly -- and then 
only on doctors' orders to take two months off this summer and take it easy at 
his home in suburban Larchmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has worked on CBS special reports. This year, he produced 
three one-hour videocassettes of CBS News material -- including one based on 
Kuralt's 1976 expedition to all 50 states -- that CBS will sell both to 
video-rental stores and via its mail-order videocassette business. 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum doesn't wonder what might have happened had he stuck it out in 
Hollywood instead of joining CBS in New York 39 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw, I think I've had more fun this way," he said. "And the important thing is 
that you keep in touch with people." 
</P>
<P>
He means people whose stories he helped report, people like former Army Sgt. 
William Floyd, who lost a leg to a booby trap in Vietnam when Birnbaum and 
Kuralt were there in 1965, filming a special on Christmas in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorable 20-years-later special, the two revisited Floyd in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"He still sends me Christmas cards," Birnbaum said. "Those things you never 
forget. And I had a chance to be close to some of the great moments of history. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud I always can say I could go back all the time, go to every story I 
ever did and be welcome. Because I gave everybody an even break."

SOME O.C. PLANNERS SEE FASTER TRAFFIC AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fed up with traffic? Ready to sell the house, pack the kids in the car and move 
to Iowa? Not so fast. Some transportation experts predict that traffic on South 
County roads, despite enormous growth ahead, will actually speed up. 
</P>
<P>
Three scenic, automated tollways may be operating by the year 2000. Commuter 
trains will deliver some residents from San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano and 
Mission Viejo to jobs in Irvine. Major thoroughfares will be widened and 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
But will the changes end the South County's nightmarish commute? 
</P>
<P>
When the region is built-out sometime after 2010, the South County population 
is expected to double to more than 1 million people, while county traffic 
planners say the network of major roads and freeways will grow by only about 
31%. Still, they are optimistic that average commuting speeds will improve -- 
from the current 28 m.p.h. to 32 -- through more efficient use of the road 
network. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the findings of The Times Orange County Poll, today's traffic 
planners won't want to hang around if their forecasts are wrong. Traffic 
congestion is the chief gripe of otherwise happy residents of coastal cities 
and the tile-roofed communities sprouting on the county's southern flank, 
according to the poll. Nearly three out of four said they are dissatisfied with 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also dispelled a common myth that most South County traffic problems 
are caused by residents commuting to job-rich North County: About 72% of South 
County respondents said they both live and work there. An even higher number -- 
75% -- said they stay south for shopping and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Which all means increasing difficulty driving in the South County. Stop-and-go 
traffic is now common on weekends. Weekday morning and evening traffic jams 
begin earlier and end later. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of commuter angst can be found in every lane. Kelly Doyle drives 50 miles 
from his home in San Clemente to his job in Corona as recreation and parks 
superintendent. He leaves at 5:45 a.m. to beat the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The commute has been worth it, Doyle said. He loves the coast too much to move 
inland, and his new job was too good to pass up. "If I leave here by quarter to 
6, I can make Corona in an hour," he said. "If I leave 10 or 15 minutes later, 
it takes me an hour and 15 minutes. And if I leave at 7 a.m., it'd take me 1 
1/2 to 2 hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ruined' a Friendship 
</P>
<P>
Amy Tucker, 32, a county social worker, spends nearly an hour fighting 23 miles 
of rush-hour congestion separating her Aliso Viejo condominium from her Santa 
Ana job. She finds she stays around home more on weekends to avoid the 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say the traffic controls my life, but it does make a difference," 
Tucker said one Friday while poking along Interstate 5 at 15 m.p.h. on the way 
home from work. "I think it ruined a really good friendship I had . . . because 
I wouldn't get on the freeway to go visit her. I pretty much stay in South 
County instead of venturing out on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
The South County traffic problems are caused by one simple fact: too many 
people trying to reach the same place at once. The Irvine area has most of the 
jobs. Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel have most of the commuters. The result is 
morning and evening traffic jams at the El Toro Y, the confluence of 
Interstates 5 and 405. 
</P>
<P>
"The split up there is where everything starts giving up," said Officer Ken 
Daily of the California Highway Patrol's South County office in San Juan 
Capistrano. "In the mornings, it backs up sometimes 9 miles down past Junipero 
Serra Road." 
</P>
<P>
However, some traffic experts, including Steve Hogan, transportation division 
manager at the county Environmental Management Agency overseeing county road 
improvements, see hope ahead. 
</P>
<P>
South county development will introduce new roads to relieve existing 
bottlenecks, and proposed widening projects on I-5 will provide more freeway 
capacity, they say. Wider acceptance of car pooling and staggered work hours 
also will help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Tollways 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can reduce any stop-and-go to a shorter period of the day, take 
some traffic off the arterials and turn those back over to their intended 
purpose of circulating people among neighborhoods," Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, traffic experts predict that construction during the 1990s 
of the three planned tollways will ease congestion on I-5 and 405. With an 
estimated $2-billion price tag to be financed almost entirely by tolls and 
developer fees, the innovative highways will add nearly 70 new miles of 
multilane pavement and give motorists an alternative to the two existing 
interstates as well as the Costa Mesa and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be the first to admit it isn't going to happen overnight, but by the time 
we reach build-out we should have a balanced community in place," Hogan said. 
"Admittedly, there's a lot of hope and optimism in what I'm saying. But people 
tend over a period of time to find their own level of comfort or convenience. 
They're going to try to minimize the hassles they face each day, and driving to 
work has become one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Another important factor in relieving traffic congestion could be a shift in 
South County traffic flow. The current flow is to the north in the morning and 
south at night. Some experts believe that new business parks in the South 
County in the coming decades will keep commuters there. 
</P>
<P>
However, others point out that the growth of business parks is a decades-long 
process, which wouldn't cause a substantial shift in commuter behavior for 
years beyond that. They say the Irvine area will remain the principal job 
magnet for the South County. And job growth will continue to outpace population 
gains -- meaning a continued daily influx of employees from Riverside and north 
San Diego county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Speed Changes Seen 
</P>
<P>
"All the business parks built in the south will help, but there's still going 
to be a dominant flow to the north each morning," said Dale Ratzlaff, a 
Caltrans deputy district director for planning in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And even if Interstate 5 is widened to 10 or 12 lanes and the tollways built, 
average freeway speeds will remain about the same as they are today, he 
predicted. Rush hour traffic jams, however, should shrink back to an hour in 
the morning and an hour at night. 
</P>
<P>
Most motorists would welcome any glimmer of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"You do not touch I-5 on weekends around here," said Dennis Morales of San 
Clemente, who enjoys a short five-mile commute to his job at the San Onofre 
nuclear power plant. "I find myself not doing things I used to. I love to go to 
Dodger Stadium. I was raised and bred on the Dodgers. But the only time I see 
them now is on TV." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for South County traffic woes are as puzzling as a freeway 
cloverleaf. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the crunch began in the early '70s when Newport Beach residents shot 
down plans for the Pacific Coast Freeway, a multilane highway that would have 
have sliced through scenic oceanfront land. Planners later stumbled repeatedly 
in the search for an alternative, while Orange County state and local lawmakers 
proved largely ineffective in securing state and federal funds for new roads. 
</P>
<P>
If alternatives had been found when the county's building boom started, no 
crisis would exist now, said Bruce Nestande, a former supervisor and current 
state Transportation Commission member. "In past years, people were just 
deferring (finding solutions) and saying the I-5 and 405 would carry every 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Today, county officials are working to get a bigger share of state 
transportation money. A new growth management plan is in effect to help ensure 
that roads and other public facilities keep pace with growth. And developers 
are cooperating more fully to make sure key connector roads are in place before 
subdivisions are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperative Effort 
</P>
<P>
A dozen large landowners east of Interstate 5, for example, have joined 
together in a cooperative effort dubbed the Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan 
to build or finance 133 miles of roadways and improvements to 40 existing 
intersections. More than a third of the roads will serve existing residents, 
with an overall goal of reducing traffic on I-5, said Al Hollinden, a 
transportation consultant working with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Some local lawmakers and traffic experts say many important road upgrades in 
the South County will be dashed or delayed dramatically unless additional 
funding is reaped from a proposed countywide half-cent sales tax measure headed 
for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The state isn't going to have the money to finance the number of road 
enhancements we need here in Orange County," said Nestande, who works for an 
Orange County development firm. "The next year is one of the most critical in 
the county's history. Without the tax, we won't be able to improve our road 
capacity. We'll have more smog. We'll have more congestion." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, contend that the proposed half-cent sales tax increase and 
roadway improvements that would spring from it are little more than a 
short-term fix. While a number of these critics support the tax, they suggest 
that its emphasis on road construction instead of alternative solutions like 
improved rail and bus systems is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the refrain of the dinosaur," said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who hopes to 
see a 15-mile monorail built during the next decade to link the city's business 
center with the airport and a planned train station. "It's just not possible 
for our road system to work effectively unless we have a more balanced 
transportation system that includes transit. We still have this misguided 
notion that roads themselves are a solution to our mobility problems." 
</P>
<P>
Agran predicted factors such as higher parking prices and heightened concern 
about air quality will force motorists to alternatives. Laguna Beach Mayor 
Robert F. Gentry agrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In a Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"We have not bitten the bullet of getting people out of their cars by any 
possible means," Gentry said. "We've got to . . . act like we're in a crisis, 
because we are in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Catalano, an Irvine resident and UC Berkeley professor who specializes in 
the health effects of urban planning decisions, suggests that South County 
residents and lawmakers need to carefully consider the consequences of an 
all-out road construction effort. New roads could improve traffic but also 
usher in unbridled development that would erode the quality of life in the 
region, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
"We can go on with the new sales tax and add more roads and more development -- 
we might even get a better balance of roads to development," Catalano said. 
"But the question remains: What kind of place will this be if we provide all 
that capacity for all that development? You may be able to get there 10 minutes 
faster, but do you want to be there when you get there?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South County's Worst Intersection 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Management Agency, which oversees the entire county road 
network, reports that, according to its ongoing vehicle counts, this 
intersection has the longest delay periods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates 
June 28 to July 1 in a telephone survey of 800 randomly selected Orange County 
adult residents on weekend days and weekday nights. Half were chosen from 
listed telephone prefixes north of the Costa Mesa Freeway and half from the 
south. Results were weighted to reflect the actual 1989 population distribution 
of North and South County. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of Orange County residents live in the north and 30% in the south. 
The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 3.5% for the total sample. 
For subgroups it is larger. For the north and south subsamples, the margin of 
error is plus or minus 5%. All interviews were confidential; however, some 
respondents who agreed were later re-interviewed for news stories.

COMMUTERS FIND WAYS TO RUN TO DAYLIGHT

Freeways clogged? Do what Kit Paradis does. Find an escape route. 
</P>
<P>
Paradis figures that he knows nearly every time-shaving shortcut between his 
home in Rancho Santa Margarita and his job at an electronics firm in Fountain 
Valley. He's rarely caught at a dead stop on an interstate. 
</P>
<P>
His list of alternatives: Residential streets, commercial thoroughfares, 
curving country lanes -- anything short of a back alley strewn with trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got dozens of them," said Paradis, who will often cruise down streets 
paralleling the freeway just long enough to skirt congestion, then find the 
nearest on-ramp back on. "I've lived in Southern California all my life, so 
I've grown up with these escape routes." 
</P>
<P>
Paradis is not alone. Thousands of South County motorists opt for a network of 
surface streets and byways as they dance their daily commuter rumba. 
</P>
<P>
California's top transportation official even endorses the principle. Last 
year, Caltrans director Robert Best issued a challenge to drivers up and down 
the state to shorten commuting times and more effectively utilize available 
roads by finding the best combination of freeways and streets. 
</P>
<P>
However, Keith Gilbert, the Automobile Club of Southern California's highway 
engineering manager, cautions that motorists diverting off freeways often end 
up as an oppressive parade of traffic through quiet neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"More traffic on surface streets puts more traffic in neighborhoods, and that 
degrades the quality of life," Gilbert said. "One of the original intents of 
the state freeway system was to get traffic out of the neighborhoods. We've 
really gotten away from that concept." 
</P>
<P>
But with South County freeways growing more crowded, drivers have no where else 
to turn. Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's San Juan 
Capistrano office said four streets in the area are relief valves: 
</P>
<P>
* From Dana Point and Laguna Niguel, motorists often skirt the freeway by 
heading up Street of the Golden Lantern to Moulton Parkway, then onto Irvine 
Center Drive and points north. 
</P>
<P>
* To bypass the El Toro Y, drivers travel twisting Laguna Canyon Road, entering 
from the coast or El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
* From inland communities from Mission Viejo to Coto de Caza, Trabuco Road and 
Irvine Boulevard are alternatives to the I-5. 
</P>
<P>
* From San Clemente to Laguna Beach, drivers take advantage of Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Other motorists have their own favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Heading south in the evening down the San Diego Freeway, James Hendron used to 
follow a maze-like path to save a few minutes. First he would turn north onto 
the Laguna Freeway for a few miles, then reverse back south on I-5 and get off 
at Alton Parkway. In following the roundabout route, Hendron was consistently 
able to save five or 10 minutes by avoiding the El Toro Y. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hendron's favorite escape route no longer exists. A few months 
back, Caltrans closed the little-used ramp connecting the northbound lanes of 
the Laguna Freeway to southbound I-5 to make way for a series of interchanges 
linked to nearby surface streets. But the path has a fond place in Hendron's 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Distance-wise, it was three times as far, but it still saved you time," 
Hendron said. "It was just a little loop that would let you bypass all the 
nonsense going on at the Y." 
</P>
<P>
Even on normal days, though, it's questionable whether the alternatives really 
save time. 
</P>
<P>
John Meyer, executive director of the agency planning three tollways in South 
County, drives Moulton Parkway north in the morning from Laguna Hills to reach 
the San Diego Freeway and head into his office in Costa Mesa. Most days, the 
13-mile trip takes an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any snag -- a major accident, an overturned truck -- it may take me 
1 1/2 hours," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although comparisons between travel time on crowded freeways and escape routes 
are difficult, the average speed on even the most congested freeways in 
Southern California is about 28 m.p.h., versus 21 m.p.h. on surface roads, 
according to the Auto Club's Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
"In pure numbers, staying on the freeway is not that bad an option," he said. 
"But I understand why people don't want to. As for me, I find it frustrating to 
sit in freeway traffic. It's less stressful to get onto the surface streets." 
</P>
<P>
James Hendron's wife, Laurie, avoids the freeways altogether these days, opting 
for a rural shortcut up Santiago Canyon Road. For a time it helped, but now the 
route is often as traffic-choked as the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"At one intersection traffic backs up so bad that I've got a book sitting next 
to me that I thumb through," Hendron said. "I figure if I have to sit more than 
a minute I might as well be reading something." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Grossman, a Laguna Beach resident and slow-growth activist who works at a 
Santa Ana aerospace firm, points out South County has fewer alternatives than 
the north, where a gridiron of streets is laid across flat terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no north-south routes, and that's part of the problem with South 
County," said Grossman, who likes to take the Coast Highway home because of the 
side streets he can use when traffic backs up in Corona del Mar or Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, meanwhile, has only one consistent escape. 
He takes Amtrak when he goes to Los Angeles for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't bother trying to find freeway alternatives. "There are none 
anymore," Gentry declared. "Everyone knows about them." 
</P>

South County: Alternative Routes 
</P>
<P>
The four most popular alternatives to near-gridlock freeway conditions in South 
County, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 From inland communities from Mission Viejo to Coto de Caza, Trabuco Road and 
Irvine Boulevard are the most popular ways to break free from the stop-and-go 
of I-5. 
</P>
<P>
2 Commuters use Laguna Canyon Road to bypass the El Toro Y, where I-5 and I-405 
come together. Motorists reach the twisting thoroughfare, used by more than 
36,000 cars each day, either from the coast of El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
3 From Dana Point and Laguna Niguel, motorists often skirt the freeway by 
heading up Street of the Golden Lantern to Moulton Parkway, then turning onto 
Irvine Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
4 Residents of seaside cities from San Clemente to Laguna Beach often use Coast 
Highway to reach points north.

Could it be that life in Orange County is more satisfying south of the Costa 
Mesa Freeway? Seventy-two percent of South County residents rate their 
community "very favorable," compared to 52% in the North County who feel the 
same way, according to The Times Orange County Poll. South County residents 
laud their communities' appearance, climate, parks and beaches. Those in the 
north highly rate their neighborhoods' convenience and shopping opportunities. 
South County residents, however, are more likely to say their communities are 
congested and boring, while more of those in the north believe that their area 
is not lacking anything. To find out how these feelings translated into 
everyday life, The Times selected six residents -- three each from North County 
and South County -- from among the 800 people polled to discuss their 
neighborhoods, life styles, likes and dislikes.

(four days ago) to see 'Peter Pan.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last dined out: Seven days ago. "We go out about twice a month, maybe a little

</P>
<P>
Life style: "I'm very satisfied. I'm close to work. I live on the east side of 
Costa Mesa. I'm in a rather rural setting. I'm a hop, skip and jump from South 
Coast Plaza. If I want to go to the beach, I'm not that far away. I think the 
northern part of Orange County is more established with single-family homes and 
more of an older tract with a little more space. You go farther south and it 
becomes real high, high density -- row after row after row of same-looking 
structures. . . . I couldn't live down there . . . too many people and too many 
cars."

<P>
Victim of crime? "Our cars have been broken into several times." 
</P>
<P>
Life style: "The city of Orange has got some charm and character that other 
cities don't; a centralized downtown. I like the fact it's close to the 
foothills. It's a central location, not that far from the beach. . . . It's not 
as smoggy as some parts of the county, like Yorba Linda. The biggest thing is 
-- it's got a small-town feel to it. The newer (South County) developments are 
pretty sterile. . . . The type of family there is very competitive, very 
yuppie-ish. I like the old parts, like San Clemente. . . . The new developments 
are real sterile, the clone homes."

END DATE OF AIRPORT WORK STILL AT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a year after construction began on John Wayne Airport's new 
$50-million passenger terminal, the prime contractor and county officials are 
still arguing over whether the project will be completed on time. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd., which is building the two-level, 
337,900-square-foot terminal, is now saying that the "substantial completion 
date" probably will be in mid- to late May, 1990, instead of March 19, 1990, as 
had been forecast earlier, according to an Aug. 7 letter from Taylor Woodrow to 
airport project managers. 
</P>
<P>
The building is scheduled to open for business on April 1, 1990, and county 
officials fear that too many delays could cause a loss in airport revenue 
needed to repay construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, however, said last week that they strongly disagree with 
Taylor Woodrow's estimated completion date. In a reply to Taylor Woodrow dated 
Aug. 23, Costa Mesa-based HPV -- the consulting firm hired by the county to 
manage the project -- said that "numerous opportunities exist to accelerate 
production and maintain or improve schedules, but these opportunities are being 
overlooked at the expense of maintaining a defensive posture in anticipation of 
failure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cushion' Exists 
</P>
<P>
Alan Murphy, a member of the county airport staff assigned to supervise the 
project, said he does not foresee any rescheduling of the April 1 terminal 
opening. If the new terminal does not open on that date, he said, a two- to 
three-month "cushion" exists before repayment of airport construction bonds 
becomes a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The airport project has been beset by controversy since last year, when Taylor 
Woodrow's low bid for the construction work came in at $59.7 million -- $19 
million higher than expected. At the same time, the project architect was fined 
for errors and delays. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, airport documents showed last week that a number of related 
contracts have escalated in cost by amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars 
to more than $1 million, mostly due to on-site construction problems. For 
example, Geofon Inc.'s contract for site preparation went up 203.2%, from 
$750,000 to $2,273,665: in the midst of pumping away some ground water, 
officials found that it was contaminated. The water had to be pumped through a 
special filtering system and removed. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, however, said that all such contract increases are within the airport's 
overall, $310-million expansion budget, which has a built-in allowance for 
contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
Airport documents also showed last week that HPV and Taylor Woodrow have been 
feuding over a number of issues in recent weeks, including bills to the county 
for speeding delivery of the terminal's steel superstructure, the buckling of 
several curved metal roof panels, and cracks and empty spaces found in the 
building's concrete floors. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that the bill for steel delivery will be negotiated downward, the 
buckling of roof panels is an "appearance" matter unrelated to safety, and the 
concrete flooring has been repaired to the satisfaction of county building 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal is part of a larger expansion program that also includes new 
parking garages, roadways, aprons and taxiways.

POSTSCRIPT: MOTHER ACQUITTED ON POSTPARTUM DEFENSE WILL REMARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months after her stunning acquittal on charges of murdering her newborn 
son with the family car, Sheryl Lynn Massip is making plans to remarry. 
</P>
<P>
But as hard as the 25-year-old woman tries to put her life back together, she 
is still confronted by painful reminders of her past. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, a production worker and then an administrative secretary for the last 
several months at an undisclosed Orange County printing firm, was laid off last 
week -- partly as a result, she contends, of her notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in La Palma with her mother, who also works at the printing firm, 
Massip said the reason management gave her for the layoff -- budget cutbacks -- 
appears to have had some foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But she also believes that the timing of the move, just days after word spread 
around the office about her identity as the woman who ran over her child and 
was acquitted of murder based on a defense of postpartum psychosis, may have 
been more than coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, now using her maiden name, had worked for several months in relative 
anonymity at the printing firm. That was until she became the subject of 
sometimes-scathing office talk after an unknown co-worker tacked a news 
photograph of her on an office bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
A friend told her that word of the photograph and the story it accompanied were 
circulating at the office and that people were saying "awful things" about her, 
Massip said. She did not want to know details. 
</P>
<P>
"Word had got around, and a lot of people just were not understanding. It 
caused a bit of a commotion for a few days," Massip said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing upset me terribly," she added. "I lost a lot of sleep, and 
I've had to visit my therapy sessions more often since then." 
</P>
<P>
Because Massip and those close to her would not disclose the name of her 
previous employer, management there could not be contacted to comment on the 
incident as she related it. 
</P>
<P>
Massip, when contacted by The Times, was also hesitant to discuss her upcoming 
marriage and would not provide details. Her fiancee is a Brea chaplain who 
works in area hospitals and convalescent homes, but she did not wish his name 
disclosed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning on children at this time," she said. "Right now, I'm not 
in any frame of mind to even consider it, and (her killing of her son in 
September, 1987) certainly has a lot to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot of pain and a lot of scars from what happened 2 1/2 years 
ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the marriage, she said: "It is a happy event. I am getting married. I just 
hope that the public and the court understand that I'm doing the best I can to 
get on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
Her concern about public understanding underlined the intense and emotional 
scrutiny drawn in the fall of 1988 to her murder trial -- a trial that featured 
tearful testimony against Massip by her ex-husband. Alfredo Massip, the father 
of the dead child, divorced Massip after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County jury, confronted with a defense that was the first of its kind 
in the state, found Massip guilty of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
It rejected Massip's claim that she was haunted by delusions caused by 
postpartum psychosis at the time she tried to throw her colicky, 6-week-old son 
into oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head with a blunt instrument, and 
finally ran over him with the family car. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, in a shocking reversal that 
legal observers said was virtually unprecedented in a murder case, threw out 
the jury's verdict and found her not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
He said she was clearly suffering at the time of the killing from postpartum 
psychosis, a disorder thought to cause severe anxiety, psychotic delusions and 
even violence in about three of every 1,000 new mothers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fitzgerald abandoned traditional procedure that would have 
resulted in Massip's incarceration for six months in a state psychiatric 
facility. Instead, he allowed her to remain free while undergoing court-ordered 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Attending group and private therapy sessions twice a week and taking hormone 
medication, Massip still suffers bouts with depression and anxiety, she and her 
family say. 
</P>
<P>
Her engagement has raised her spirits. But as evidenced by her problems at the 
printing company, Massip said she is not sure she will ever fully overcome her 
past. "I'm coping, that's all I can say."

NEWPORT BEACH TAKES A FIRST STEP TOWARD CONSIDERING CFC BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach City Council will discuss forming an ad hoc committee tonight 
to study banning the use of chemicals and compounds that erode Earth's ozone 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say it is unlikely, however, that they would adopt an ordinance 
as comprehensive as the one Irvine approved last week, restricting the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), among other substances. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach council will also consider adopting a resolution urging 
state, national and international leaders to work toward a ban on CFCs, which 
are used in cleaning solvents, aerosol cans and refrigerator and 
air-conditioning coolants. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have said that CFCs and other chlorinated solvents are destroying 
the earth's ozone layer, which protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation, 
which can cause skin cancer and other diseases. The compounds are also 
associated with an effect called global warming, which scientists predict could 
eventually cause catastrophic changes in Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Newport Beach Environmental Quality Affairs Citizens Advisory 
Committee recommended a ban on plastic foam food packaging made with CFCs. It 
also asked the city to create a task force to study going further and, as 
Irvine did, regulating all CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's ordinance affects a wide range of products and services, including air 
conditioning repair firms and companies that make computer components, building 
insulation and fast-food packaging. The ordinance bans the use of several 
compounds altogether and requires recycling of certain compounds used in air 
conditioning and refrigeration. It allows exemptions when no alternative 
compound is available or, in the case of small emissions, when recycling or 
replacement would be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not real likely that we will take as strong a step," Newport Beach 
Councilwoman Jean Watt said, but "hopefully, this will be at least a step 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Mayor Donald A. Strauss said that most council members want to 
learn more about the such a ban would have before taking action. An ad hoc 
committee could take several months to study the issue and make 
recommendations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a big problem," Strauss said. "I wouldn't want to just go away and 
say, 'Someone else will solve it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The council is divided over whether Newport Beach could have any significant 
influence in solving the problem. Some say a local ban would have a minute 
effect and that therefore the issue should be left to regional, state or 
national officials so that many cities would be operating under a uniform law. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of problem that needs to be addressed on a regional basis," 
said Councilman Clarence J. Turner. "The proper way may be an all-encompassing 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"For the city of Newport Beach to pass some sort of ordinance, the ultimate 
effect of the problem might be like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon." 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said that his city, which has a heavy 
concentration of high-tech industries, makes a relatively substantial 
contribution to the emission problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is, in the case of Irvine, we are a very 
disproportionate part of a national problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Agran said that in the absence of state and federal legislation, local 
governments have had to take the lead. Irvine's ordinance has attracted the 
attention of several major cities, including Newark, Minneapolis and 
Albuquerque, that are considering similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's suitable for replication in city after city across the country," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, outside of Newport Beach, San Clemente is the only Orange County city 
to have asked Irvine officials about their ordinance, said Jim Jenal, an Irvine 
council aide. He has also, Jenal said, received inquiries from San Diego, San 
Jose, Santa Monica, Berkley and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Some Newport Beach council members also fear that a ban would either be 
unenforceable or so stringent that it would prompt some industries to leave 
town. "I want to know, if we are going to pass a law, can we enforce it?" said 
Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest of 3 Firms 
</P>
<P>
Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, said 
that three manufacturing companies that have divisions in Newport -- Rockwell 
International Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co. and Ford Aerospace Corp. -- have been 
most concerned about any such action on the part of the council. 
</P>
<P>
"They're kind of upset about the Irvine ordinance," Luehrs said. "They'd rather 
have a lot of discussion (with the council) first . . . and then pass an 
ordinance accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Luehrs said that the chamber, as do some council members, favors leaving it to 
state and federal authorities to legislate such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
"Local ordinances would vary from community to community, and we don't think 
that makes a lot of sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Bond, a spokesman for the Rockwell Semiconductor Products Division in 
Newport Beach, said a ban would have little impact on the company beit only 
uses CFCs in very small amounts for degreasing. Most often, the company uses 
water soluble fluxes in product production, such as in the cleaning of circuit 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it would be a negligible problem," he said.

SOUZA WINS BIATHLON TO KEEP STREAK GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Souza, never one to peer over his shoulder during a race, continued his 
unbeaten streak Sunday at the Coors Light Biathlon Series at the Brea 
Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Souza, who splits his training between San Diego and Boulder, Colo., held off 
late charges by Brent Steiner of Tempe, Ariz., and Joel Thompson of Encinitas, 
to win his 16th consecutive race on the Coors series since it began last year. 
Liz Downing, of Portland, Ore., won the women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Souza finished the three-segment race -- a five-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, a 
30-kilometer (18.6-mile) bike ride and another five-kilometer run -- in a 
course-record 1 hour 10 minutes 18 seconds. The record for the Brea course was 
1:16:54 set last year by Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Souza, 24, led the entire race and had a 70-second lead after the bike ride. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner finished second in 1:11:15 and Thompson third at 1:12:09. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the closest so far this year," Souza said. "I knew I had a good lead. I 
just wanted to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a course where you're able to ride fast on. There are more turns and 
areas where riders who aren't as strong can do well." 
</P>
<P>
Souza said he wasn't aware he was on a record pace. In fact, he rarely keeps 
track of times. 
</P>
<P>
"Each course varies," he said. "Some are longer and some are shorter in 
different areas. It's not a sport where you can judge your times, like track 
and field, where you have set distances like the 400 (meters) and the mile." 
</P>
<P>
Souza entered the race with a 40-point lead over Thompson in the season 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bonus pool at the end of the year for the series champion," Souza 
said. "This is what I do for a living, just like a pro golfer or tennis player. 
This is my circuit and I travel around and do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
Downing made sure there were no surprises in the women's race. 
</P>
<P>
She held off early challenges from Kristi Kidwell of Anaheim and defending 
champion Sue Griesbach of Fullerton to win in 1:19:27. Downing, who leads the 
women's point standings, broke Griesbach's course record by 6:25. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm pretty happy with my time," said Downing, who has won six of the seven 
races she's entered this year. "But you never know, the course could have been 
short. It's definitely the most technical course I've been on." 
</P>
<P>
Kidwell, who finished second in 1:22:27, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
She encountered some unexpected obstacles on the cycling course -- runners. The 
races were started in several different flights, with runners and cyclists 
meeting at certain points on the course. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Kidwell found herself weaving on her bike like a Grand Prix racer. 
</P>
<P>
"The runners are supposed to stick to the right side," she said. "But when 
people got tired, they were spread all over the road. There were a couple near 
misses." 
</P>
<P>
Souza said he noticed some slick spots on the cycling course. Sprinklers had 
been left on during the race. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few spots," he said. "But it wasn't bad." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Shorter, winner of the 1972 Olympic marathon, finished seventh in 
1:17:08.

DICK DALE'S DEL-TONES SAVOR THE SURGE OF '60S PROPULSIVE SURF ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The essence of surf music has been obscured by all the lightweight imagery that 
went with it back when the Southern California dream was being retailed to an 
eager nation: Frankie and Annette, beach blanket bingo, fun fun fun in the 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
All those trappings may have helped sell surf music back in its early-'60s 
heyday, but it is the core musical notion behind the style that makes it worth 
listening to now. The idea was to infuse a rock instrumental with the feeling 
of being caught up in a wild, elemental surge. 
</P>
<P>
As the prime inventor of surf-guitar music, Dick Dale is not likely to neglect 
that essence. It has been more than 30 years since he created the style in the 
long-vanished dance halls of Balboa and Huntington Beach. But playing Friday 
night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano with his current bunch of 
backing Del-Tones, Dale showed that he still knows how to take his guitar on a 
wild, dramatic ride. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's two 50-minute sets covered the lighthearted, beach party aspect of his 
genre with honking, horn-driven R&amp;B numbers, '50s rock classics and a few 
of his own more chirpy oldies. But the real thrills came when Dale, 51, set the 
bouncier stuff aside and got down to blazing dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
After quickie renditions of a couple of his lighter signature tunes, "Let's Go 
Trippin' " and "Mr. Peppermint Man," Dale began to play definitive surf rock 
that featured fast, staccato picking, reverb-soaked tone and careening slides 
down the neck of his old, gold-spangled Fender Stratocaster. It all came 
together on a propulsive "Surf Beat," then continued as Dale changed the mood 
to flamenco-style grandeur during a fine, shifting number that alternated 
between flurrying riffing and slow, stately Spanish motifs. 
</P>
<P>
The segment closed at a gallop, featuring the Del-Tones' punchy young 
three-piece horn section. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the early set, Dale and rhythm guitarist Ron Eglit got into some 
fiery dueling as they replayed the "Pipeline" guitar duet that won Dale and 
Stevie Ray Vaughan a 1987 Grammy nomination (the Vaughan-Dale guitar shoot-out 
is the closing track on a new, 18-song Rhino Records CD release, "King of the 
Surf Guitar: The Best of Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones"). 
</P>
<P>
The ideal way to see Dale in concert might be in one of those old-time rock 'n' 
roll revues of the early to mid-'60s, where each act got to display its best 
stuff for 15 minutes or half an hour. Then the set could be one driving wave, 
with maybe a couple of jaunty numbers like "Let's Go Trippin' " thrown in for 
relief between surges. 
</P>
<P>
But Dale and the Del-Tones also had a good-time, dance-band function to 
fulfill. They did a capable job of it, judging from the lively dance-floor 
traffic through most of the show (when the "Peter Gunn" theme turned out to be 
a crowd favorite, Dale took his band through three different renditions of it). 
</P>
<P>
Dale, looking like a craggy-faced John Wayne under his black cowboy hat, played 
most of the show off the cuff, singing a snippet of one song, then launching 
abruptly into another. A round-the-world routine in which Dale played just 
about every instrument on the band stand, including trumpet, keyboards and 
drums, had more shtick value than musical appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's audience ranged from old-time fans to fashionable, scrubbed-looking kids 
who would not have looked out of place at a Depeche Mode show. Being a local 
hero probably helps his continuing appeal, but Dale's playing remains a strong 
attraction on its merits, and a must-see for guitar aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
The surf-guitar style may be historic, but the wild rides Dale takes with it 
are by no means history.

STATE PANEL SENDS SOME O.C. GROUPS OFF WITH NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Historical and Cultural Foundation of Orange County and the Garden Grove 
Symphony, each considered for 1989-90 state grants for their organizations, 
were awarded nothing last week when the California Arts Council spiked a 
proposal to support more arts groups than usual. The changes were made after 
the council learned that the proportional funding formula for small and 
mid-size groups statewide specified a smaller percentage this year. 
</P>
<P>
The council action, taken at a two-day meeting in Sacramento last week, also 
resulted in lower-than-expected grants to Relampago del Cielo, the Laguna Poets 
and Orange Coast College Community Services. These organizations each received 
$1,000 instead of $1,500 as suggested under the rejected proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Council grants are determined by formulas based on the budgets of the groups 
submitting proposals and by evaluations of their artistic merit, managerial 
competence and efforts to reach the community. A ranking system for groups with 
budgets of less than $1 million assigns each group a rating from 1, the lowest, 
to 4. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, only groups rated 3-minus and above have been given council 
grants. But because the council had $1million more in its budget this year, for 
a total of $16.6 million, its members suggested giving $1,000 grants to groups 
rated 2-plus, which would have included the Historical and Cultural Foundation 
and the Garden Grove Symphony, and a minimum of $1,500 to smaller groups 
scoring higher (Relampago del Cielo, the Laguna Poets and Orange Coast College 
Community Services). 
</P>
<P>
A study to consider the impact of this grant-expansion proposal showed that 
statewide, both the number of eligible applicants and their quality ratings 
increased this year. As a result, under previous funding formulas -- even with 
the extra $1 million -- 560 small and medium-size groups eligible for grants 
would receive proportionately less than they would have with the same ratings 
last year, said Tere Romo, the council's organizational grants program manager. 
</P>
<P>
Top ranked groups -- those receiving 4s -- would receive 65% of the funding 
they qualified for, rather than the 68% they got in 1988-89, according to Romo. 
Giving money to a greater number of groups, she said, would have meant 
decreasing the sizes of all grants awarded another 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the council voted last week to stick with its previous 
grant-awarding methods. 
</P>
<P>
The proportional decrease caused concern among many attending the council 
meeting. Last year, proportional funding fell by 10% for all groups of every 
size statewide. (The council was funding its top-ranked applicants at 100% a 
few years ago, but it has since changed its methods out of a desire to give 
money to a greater number of groups.) 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how debilitating it is to get a phone call from the 
(California Arts Council) telling you that your rank has gone up and your 
funding has gone down," said Thomas R. Hall, managing director of the Old Globe 
Theatre in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 Orange County arts groups were awarded $321,950 in organizational 
grants this year.

They say we use up one-third of our lives sleeping, but when you think of all 
the hours a typical Southern Californian spends creeping along the freeway in a 
wheeled metal box, driving looks like the real time-gobbler. Yet for most 
people, American car culture still invokes the thrills of potential danger, 
sexual dalliance and delicious escapism. 
</P>
<P>
There must be hundreds of pop songs, from the Soul Survivors' "Expressway to 
Your Heart" to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car," that use behind-the-wheel metaphors 
to make their point. A whole genre of novels, beginning in 1957 with Jack 
Kerouac's "On the Road," have detailed the lives of restless young people who 
crisscross the country in search of new kicks, old loves or self-knowledge. 
And, of course, movies wouldn't be same without romantic drives, screaming car 
chases and the long-distance auto travel of unlikely couples ("Rain Man," "When 
Harry Met Sally").

In visual art, the famous abstract crumpled car-body sculptures of John 
Chamberlain come to mind, as well as Edward Kienholz's once-scandalous "Back 
Seat Dodge" (a real car body with figures copulating on the back seat). But in 
general, cars don't seem to matter much in contemporary art -- perhaps because 
the center of the contemporary-art scene is New York, where many people don't 
own a car or even a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing daunted, the Muckenthaler Cultural Center has come up with an exhibit 
(through Sept. 3) called "The Traveling Show: Art Influenced by 
Transportation." The title encompasses other types of vehicles besides cars and 
the show itself wanders farther afield to deal -- too vaguely, alas -- with 
pathways and the general idea of movement. But cars and the basic on-the-road 
experience are the main event here. 
</P>
<P>
There is one fine Chamberlain, "Etruscan Romance" from 1984, a bulwark of 
lustrous, compressed metal components in deep red, rose, green and blue aligned 
in vertical slabs. And there is also a strong and wildly varied group of other 
works that deal specifically with the mystique of the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Almaraz's painting "Flip Over" exults in the brilliant colors of a 
terrible freeway fire and the wild, ghastly freedom of a car somersaulting in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
A mixed-media work by Mel Rubin, "Rampant Miasma," replays the view from behind 
a steering wheel, with the rear-view mirror wryly reflecting a sweetened image 
of the Home Sweet Home the driver left behind. In one of his atmospheric 
watercolors, George James captures the blurred beauty of reflections of 
taillights in a delicatessen parking lot ("Subs Made Now"). 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lapin's mixed-media painting "Karen" is a tongue-in-cheek treatment of 
the sex-and-freedom side of car culture. The image is of a woman lounging by a 
back-yard pool with a Cadillac half-submerged in it. "Her skirt ripped the 
engine roared the car leapt . . . " reads the text incorporated in the work. 
But Karen moved away after this tumultuous encounter, and the narrator decided 
he was "through with love." 
</P>
<P>
Dustin Shuler, known in these parts for his long-term interest in car imagery, 
is represented by several works. The most successful of these is the slyly 
sexual "Ships That Pass in the Night." Recreated on a giant scale with bamboo 
and rice paper, a full-blown breastlike '50s taillight and a baroque tail fin 
share a patch of wall space. 
</P>
<P>
At first somewhat mystifying, Richard Sigmund's gray painting, "Century Park E. 
and Pico, LA, CA, USA," proves to be a dryly minimal image of a swatch of the 
asphalt at that Los Angeles intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Stecyk's installation "Fish Tale" is an array of hubcaps organized with 
the ponderous symmetry typical of a zealous amateur collector. Deadpan 
text-and-photo documentation explains that the collector (shown in typical 
proud-fisherman pose with his catch) "worshiped the big fish." But, realizing 
that "destiny now favored another voyager," he began stalking nocturnal streets 
and parking lots looking for Plymouth Barracudas and Packards. 
</P>
<P>
Other topical work on view includes Michael Hart's painting "On the Road" (a 
flashy guy in a car that absurdly straddles two square mountains), Tom Jenkins' 
fanciful painting of freeway disaster, "Alternate Route Advised," Roger Kuntz's 
vintage painting "Signs" (an impressionistic view of a cluster of signs above a 
moody underpass), and Robin Palanker's pastel "I-5," a soft, gray curve under a 
bleached-out sky. 
</P>
<P>
With so much zesty art based on the car-and-road theme, it is unclear why the 
show veers into other areas. Such works as Karl Matson's "Wagon for Guatemala" 
(superficially about transportation, but clearly begging questions of a 
political nature) and Michael McMillen's painstaking construction "The 
Observatory" seem radically misplaced in this show. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than roam all over the map, stretching the "transportation" theme to the 
breaking point, it would have been better to try to analyze just what artists 
are saying about the impact of travel on our lives. All viewers have to go on 
is a brief wall-text essay by Bonnie L. Grad, an associate professor of art 
history at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. It's much too short to do 
justice to the subject and wallows in generalities instead of making clear-cut, 
concrete points. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Muckenthaler curator Norman Lloyd says his institution is unable 
to fund even no-frills, Xeroxed brochures for the exhibitions, and he has only 
a tiny budget for guest wall-text essays like Grad's. This is most unfortunate. 
If nothing else, community art centers should be information centers, places 
where people can absorb basic information about how to look at art and how it 
relates to real-life issues. 
</P>
<P>
Assembling good art and hanging it in logical ways are important ingredients of 
a successful exhibit. But even the snappiest exhibit title can't replace a 
thoughtful essay that places the art in a meaningful context and illuminates 
the reason someone went to the considerable trouble of pulling all the pieces 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Traveling Show: Art Influenced by Transportation" remains through 
Saturday at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave. in 
Fullerton. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m. 
Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 738-6595.

State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, blaming a back injury, did not 
appear today at a state hearing to answer questions about whether she is biased 
toward insurers in her implementation of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not pleased at her absence," said state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), 
chairman of the Senate Committee on Insurance, Claims and Corporations, which 
held the hearing in downtown Los Angeles. He said Gillespie's office had 
notified him of the injury Friday afternoon and asked for a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Gillespie intensified last week after she said three of the 
state's biggest auto insurers will not be required to roll back rates because 
they lost too much money in 1988.

VOYAGER BEAMS BACK PROOF OF NEPTUNE, TRITON AURORAS

Voyager 2 data confirm the existence of flickering auroral displays in the 
atmospheres of the ringed planet Neptune and its baffling volcanic moon Triton 
-- the coldest world ever studied, scientists announced today. 
</P>
<P>
University of Arizona researcher Roger Yelle told a news conference that 
analysis of data beamed back earlier in the Voyager 2 Neptune encounter 
indicates the temperature of Triton's lower atmosphere is 400 degrees below 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature of the atmosphere is 37 degrees (above absolute zero), which 
is equivalent to 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero," he said. "Simply put, 
Triton appears to be the coldest object in the solar system that we've visited 
so far." 
</P>
<P>
He said both Triton and Neptune have auroras -- the flickering displays 
produced by the interaction of electrically charged particles and a planet's 
magnetic field -- although the phenomenon on Neptune is complex and difficult 
to understand. 
</P>
<P>
The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor revealed auroras 
-- somewhat like Earth's northern and southern lights -- in several places in 
Neptune's skies and over much of the day side of Triton, Yelle said. 
</P>
<P>
The auroras occur at odd places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, 
which is a steep 50 degrees from the planet's rotation axis, Yelle said. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 2 is now cruising away from the solar system on an endless space 
odyssey. Scientists are discussing the possibility of using the spacecraft's 
cameras to take a wide-angle shot of the whole solar system at some point in a 
first-of-a-kind portrait of humanity's home in the cosmos.

MAN KILLED IN BURBANK PARTY FIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and two others were seriously wounded in a triple stabbing 
during a fight at a birthday party in Burbank, police said today. Two men were 
arrested after the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Don Goldberg said a fight broke out about 8:15 p.m. at an apartment 
complex in the 2300 block of North Ontario Avenue. About 30 people were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
During the melee, three residents of the neighborhood who attended the party -- 
David Robles, 25, Audiel Gonzalez, 21, and Mario Jovin, 23 -- were stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
Robles was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where he died about 
an hour after the attack. Gonzalez and Jovin were taken to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, where they were listed in serious but stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Ramon Ambriz, 35, and Santiago Ponce, 21, on suspicion of 
murder shortly after the stabbing. Both men, who live at the complex, were 
being held without bail at the Burbank Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said investigators have not determined the cause of the fight. The 
incident was not believed to have been gang-related.

South African police tear-gassed hundreds of black pupils today after a protest 
march against racially segregated schools, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
They said pupils and teachers marched toward a prestigious whites-only school 
in Queenstown, near the Indian Ocean city of East London, as part of a 
nationwide defiance campaign against Pretoria's race laws. Police stopped the 
march but allowed a small delegation into the school. Tear gas was fired as 
marchers dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, blacks trying to board whites-only buses today were foiled when 
drivers closed automatic doors or refused to stop. Organizers said only two 
non-white passengers, both ethnic Indians, managed to board. Witnesses said 
police arrested three blacks who attempted to board a whites-only bus in the 
center of Pretoria.

EX-REP. SWINDALL GETS A YEAR IN JAIL;

GEORGIA REPUBLICAN FINED $30,000 FOR LYING TO GRAND JURY

<P>
Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall was sentenced to one year in prison today for 
lying to a federal grand jury about a loan he negotiated with an undercover 
agent posing as a drug-money launderer. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman also imposed a $30,000 fine plus a $450 
fee against Swindall, who was convicted on nine counts of perjury in June. 
</P>
<P>
The prison term was 12 months on each count to run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Swindall, a two-term Republican from Atlanta's eastern suburbs, spoke to the 
judge for about half an hour in rambling remarks that frequently touched on 
issues in the trial. But Freeman told him several times that this was not the 
place to retry his case. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand before you in all humility," he told the judge at one point. Freeman 
interrupted him, saying, "You don't know the meaning of humility, Mr. Swindall. 
I thought you were beginning to learn it, but I'm afraid you're not." 
</P>
<P>
After the judge imposed the sentence, Swindall smiled and shook hands with his 
attorneys. The judge said the former representative will remain free on his own 
recognizance pending an appeal of the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Swindall later told reporters he thought the sentence was proper for someone 
guilty of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no complaints whatsoever. The problem I have is not the length of the 
sentence, but whether it should have been imposed at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. Atty. Robert Barr was asked if the government was satisfied with the 
relatively light sentence, he replied, "It's not really up to us to be 
satisfied. We thought a more lengthy sentence was called for." 
</P>
<P>
The judge recommended that Swindall serve his sentence at a minimum-security 
federal prison camp in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence in his trial showed that Swindall repeatedly talked with the 
undercover agent and a political associate as he was seeking $850,000 to finish 
his luxurious Stone Mountain home, even after a time when he told the grand 
jury he had "walked away" from the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
Swindall lost a bid for reelection last year to Democrat Ben Jones while under 
the cloud of his perjury indictment.

"Miss Taylor has in fact completed a manuscript which chronicles her life but 
there are no immediate plans for its release," according to a statement from 
Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam &amp; Associates.

The statement was issued in the wake of the disclosure by C. David Heymann,

JIM BAKKER 'LOVED THINGS AND USED PEOPLE,' JURORS TOLD AS TRIAL OPENS

A federal prosecutor today outlined the government's fraud and conspiracy case 
against PTL founder Jim Bakker, saying the evangelist became a man "who loved 
things and used people." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Jerry Miller, in his opening remarks to the jury, said, "This case 
is about cheating people, about taking their money, about tricking people out 
of their money by misrepresenting a Christian theme park." 
</P>
<P>
Bakker, 49, could face 120 years in prison if convicted on 24 fraud and 
conspiracy counts stemming from the way he raised and spent money at PTL. The 
central issue is the sale of "lifetime partnerships," which promised three 
nights' free lodging each year for life to anyone who gave PTL $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer George T. Davis called Bakker a creative, religious genius and 
said there is no evidence that he sold anything or had any criminal intent to 
defraud people. 
</P>
<P>
"We will prove that there was not a sale of one single membership or lifetime 
partnership," Davis said. "What happened was gifts or donations. This was a 
church. This was an outreach program."

CHINESE STUDENT SENTENCED TO 9 YEARS FOR PROTEST ROLE

A student charged with spreading rumors to the Voice of America during spring 
pro-democracy protests has been given a nine-year prison term, a state 
newspaper reported today. It was the first announced sentencing of a student 
participant since the government's June crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The China Youth News said Zhang Weiping, 25, was sentenced Saturday by the 
Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court for spreading counterrevolutionary 
propaganda and instigating criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a fourth-year student at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in the eastern 
city of Hangzhou, admitted some of the charges against him but would not 
acknowledge that his acts were counterrevolutionary, the daily said. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that on June 6, two days after the bloody military crackdown of 
the student movement in Beijing, Zhang called the U.S.-funded Voice of America 
and falsely reported that students in Hangzhou forced local authorities to fly 
the Chinese flag at half-staff to mourn victims of the Beijing massacre. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad Political Influence' 
</P>
<P>
It said that Zhang sent a tape of the VOA broadcast of his report to his 
university and that "it created a very bad political influence." 
</P>
<P>
The court also accused Zhang of drawing eight cartoons vilifying Communist 
Party and government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not say when Zhang was convicted, but conviction and 
sentencing often happen at the same time. It also did not say under what clause 
of the criminal code he was tried or what the maximum sentence was. 
</P>
<P>
One clause covering counterrevolutionaries who incite the masses says those 
found guilty of serious cases shall not serve terms of less than five years. A 
counterrevolutionary can get a life term if the offense is deemed serious 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese police have arrested thousands of workers and students who took part in 
the pro-democracy movement and have publicly sentenced dozens of workers to 
long prison terms for rioting and causing social disturbances.

Kermit and many of the other Muppets will be joining ranks with Mickey Mouse 
and his friends in a business agreement announced today by Walt Disney World 
and Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
Henson and Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney Co., 
have signed an agreement in principle for Disney to acquire Henson Associates 
Inc., including its film and television library, Disney said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
It did not mention a price. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes agreements for Henson to do long-term consulting and 
production. The announcement said he will produce motion pictures, network and 
off-network TV shows, Disney Channel specials and series, and made-for-home 
video programming. 
</P>
<P>
Also included are special Muppet attractions and rides for Disney theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
Work is already under way for the first such project, a Muppet film attraction 
using 3-D technology. The attraction, to open next spring at the Disney-MGM 
Studios Theme Park here, will be a collaboration between Henson and Walt Disney 
Imagineering. 
</P>
<P>
In the release, Eisner hailed the proposal as "a business association made in 
family entertainment heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, winner of several Emmy awards, introduced Kermit the Frog and other 
Muppets to TV in the 1950s. His library includes the TV shows "The Muppet 
Show," "Fraggle Rock," and "Muppet Babies" and the films "The Muppet Movie," 
"The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Dark Crystal." 
</P>
<P>
Henson's puppet segments and characters created for "Sesame Street," including 
Big Bird, aren't included in the agreement, the release said.

Debt-ridden Resorts International Inc. and its subsidiaries have stopped paying 
interest to its bondholders, company officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that Resorts is a much bigger challenge than we 
anticipated," said company owner and Chairman Merv Griffin in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter to bondholders dated today, the entertainer explained that 
cash flow has been less than originally anticipated, "in part because we 
underestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take to turn around 
the company's operations to generate increased profits." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, who purchased the company from developer Donald Trump in November, 
wrote that it has taken Resorts longer than expected to sell "non-operating 
real estate assets." 
</P>
<P>
Resorts, based in Atlantic City, faced payments of more than $130 million in 
interest and principle this year, but its operations will not likely generate 
enough money to cover that. In 1988, the company's cash flow was $60.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium will be in place indefinitely, pending an agreement with the 
company's bondholders on a recapitalization of the company, according to a 
statement issued by the company.

TRADE DEFICIT AT 4-YEAR LOW IN SPRING QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $27.72 billion from April through June, the 
smallest quarterly imbalance in four years, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and U.S. exports showed a 
2.3% improvement from the first three months of the year, when the trade 
deficit totaled $28.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement stemmed from a 3.4% increase in exports, which climbed to a 
record $90.87 billion. This more than offset a 2% rise in imports, which also 
hit a record of $118.58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The April-June trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, was 
at the lowest since a $25.7-billion deficit in the first quarter of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of the year, the deficit was running at an annual rate 
of $112.2 billion, down 11.7% from the $127.2 billion deficit registered in all 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, many economists are predicting the deficit will begin rising in the 
last half of this year. They are worried that the rising value of the dollar 
will make U.S. goods less competitive on overseas markets at the same time that 
Americans' appetite for imports remains undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance-of-payments 
basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the Commerce Department's 
monthly merchandise trade reports. 
</P>
<P>
The totals are slightly different because the new report excludes military 
sales by the U.S. government to foreign governments and makes other minor 
adjustments in the monthly figures. 
</P>
<P>
In the April-June quarter, non-farm exports increased $2 billion to a record 
$80.1 billion. The largest increases were in industrial supplies and materials, 
capital goods and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. agricultural exports were virtually unchanged at $10.7 billion in the 
April-June quarter. Wheat shipments dropped $500 million, reflecting a drop in 
exports to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in imports reflected a jump in petroleum imports, which rose 24% 
to $13.4 billion, with most of the increase coming from higher prices rather 
than volume. Non-oil imports declined by $300 million to $105.2 billion, with 
the largest decrease coming from a $1.7-billion drop in foreign car shipments.

<P>
Robson da Silva of Brazil, the Olympic bronze medalist, won the gold medal in 
the men's 200-meter dash at the World University Games today. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva, who posted a time of 19.96 seconds at a Grand Prix meet in Brussels 
on Friday, clocked a relatively slow 20.33. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva, the fastest man in the world this year over the distance, trailed 
Felix Stevens of Cuba going into the homestretch. But Da Silva's long stride 
and powerful acceleration enabled him to charge past Stevens in the final 50 
meters. Da Silva slowed in the final 10 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens finished second in 20.58 and Kevin Braunskill of the United States was 
third in 20.62. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Backley of Britain won the men's javelin with a meet-record throw of 280 
feet, 10 inches, the third longest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Galina Malchougina of the Soviet Union easily won the women's 200 in 22.70. 
Liliana Allen of Cuba edged Esther Jones of the United States for the silver. 
Allen was timed in 23.00, with Jones close behind in 23.02. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most exciting duels was in the women's 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles, with Margarita Khromonova of the Soviet Union battling Rosey Edeh of 
Canada for the gold throughout the race.

3 GRIDDERS END CONTRACT HOLDOUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Wide receiver Mike Quick today signed three one-year contracts with the 
Philadelphia Eagles, ending a holdout just in time for one game of preseason 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed at a press conference this morning. He 
previously had a three-year contract worth $700,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, a five-time Pro Bowl selection who missed the first four preseason 
games, will be among the highest-paid wide receivers in the NFL, Eagles 
President Harry Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Al Toon, the leading pass-catcher in the NFL last season, has 
ended his holdout and signed a series of three one-year contracts with the New 
York Jets, the club announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Toon, the Jets' leading receiver each of the last three years, topped the NFL 
in receptions in 1988 with 93, for 1,067 yards and five touchdowns. He also was 
voted to the Pro Bowl for the third straight time. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Carter, the Minnesota Vikings' Pro Bowl receiver, arrived in training 
camp this morning, ending a 28-day holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has said he wants to extend his contract to include a big raise from the 
$400,000 he is to earn this year. He wants about $1 million annually, but 
General Manager Mike Lynn has steadfastly said he would not negotiate with 
Carter or any other signed player who was not in camp.

RAIDERS RELEASE LOFTON, 9 OTHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Wide receiver James Lofton, the seventh leading pass catcher in NFL history, 
was released today by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton, 33, was one of 10 players cut by the Raiders, who must trim seven more 
players to meet Tuesday's roster limit of 60. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton, who went to seven Pro Bowls while with Green Bay, was acquired by the 
Raiders before the 1987 season. He caught 41 passes for 880 yards and five 
touchdowns in 1987. In 1988, his production fell to 28 catches for 549 yards. 
For the first time in 11 NFL seasons, he did not score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Also released today by the Raiders was 34-year-old tight end Jimmie Giles, a 
veteran of 12 seasons who joined the Raiders as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Linden King, 34, was another casualty. He was the starting left 
outside linebacker the last two seasons but was demoted to reserve status this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also cut by the Raiders were linebacker Ron Brown, defensive back David 
Greenwood, defensive lineman Clyde Glover, offensive lineman Larry Lee, running 
back Anthony Mosley, wide receiver Stephen Starring and punter Mike Gillette.

Defending singles champions Steffi Graf and Mats Wilander made short work of 
their opening-round opponents today to launch the 1989 U.S. Open tennis 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the world's No. 1 and winner of six of the last seven grand slam events, 
overwhelmed Etsuko Inoue of Japan 6-3, 6-1 in the tournament's opening match at 
the Louis Armstrong Stadium's center court. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not totally happy with how I played," the 20-year-old West German said 
after her 56-minute victory. "In the first set I was rushing too much. I wasn't 
being patient enough to wait for the right shot." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, men's defending champion, mired in a slump all year, shrugged off 
what could have been a tough challenge with a confident 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory 
over Austrian Horst Skoff, ranked 29th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's victory under overcast skies opened what promised to be a busy day at 
the noisy National Tennis Center with 64 opening-round matches scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Other stars due to take to the courts included four-time champion John McEnroe 
and Wimbledon champion Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's compatriot, Claudia Kohde-Kilsch, fell 6-4, 6-0 to Nathalie Herreman of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union escaped the dubious distinction of being 
the first seed to fall when she pulled out a 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 win over Pascale 
Paradis of France. 
</P>
<P>
Other women winners included Americans Camille Benjamin and Ann Grossman and 
France's Nathalie Tauziat. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin beat Brazilian Andrea Vieira 6-2, 6-2, and Grossman eliminated Dinky 
van Rensberg of South Africa 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Tauziat defeated American Andrea Farley 6-1, 6-3.
