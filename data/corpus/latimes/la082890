SAN MARCOS CAMPUS OPENS WITH FANFARE

<TEXT>
<P>
The classrooms were unlocked, the power was on, the books were on the shelves 
and the faculty was in place at the newest university in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Cal State San Marcos, the first new public university in the state 
in 20 years, couldn't be more pleased with the way things went on the first day 
of class Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impression is that it went off very well," university President Bill 
W. Stacy said after a ribbon-cutting ceremony, complete with balloons, a 
marching band and larger-than-life scissors -- borrowed from the Chamber of 
Commerce -- that failed to cut the ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
The university, in the planning for more than five years, started life in an 
industrial park with 482 students. University officials hope to move into a 
permanent facility by 1992. The 300-acre campus will be completed over the next 
20 years at a cost of $650 million, and is expected to serve 25,000 students 
per semester. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the usual symptoms that traditionally accompany the first day of 
school, such as lost students and jitters, opening day went off with relatively 
few hitches. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty alike shared in the giddiness of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel excited, and I feel that this is where I'm supposed to be," said 
Anthony DiAngelis, one of four men enrolled in the 50-student teacher 
credential program, the fledgling university's only post-baccalaureate program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're starting a new university, there's an energy. There's a lot of 
disorganization here, but that's fine. . . . It's part of the spirit of the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the disorganization came from students and, in some cases, staff 
members trying to find where everything is. A directory of the campus, which 
was to have been installed by Monday, had been delayed and was not in place. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confused. . . . Let's just start walking somewhere," said one female 
student, feeling her way around the industrial park, trying to find her world 
geography class. 
</P>
<P>
In the faculty rooms, too, there was nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way of not being a little nervous, but I don't feel it too much," 
said Cliff Summers, who teaches a biology course about stress. "You've got to 
stand in front of a lot of people, and you're not sure what stupid thing you're 
going to say. 
</P>
<P>
"If I make a fool of myself, I guess I just do." 
</P>
<P>
Some students compared their first-day experiences with those at other 
universities they have attended. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day at San Diego State University is spent just finding parking," 
said Ted Saulino, who attended SDSU for three years before transferring to Cal 
State San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The smallness of the young university is something for students to take 
advantage of while they can, faculty members said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the advantages of a small class is that it can be very personal," said 
Margaret Roark, a biology professor whose first class had only four students, 
two of whom had not yet signed up for it. 
</P>
<P>
"This class will be very special because it will give them a chance to be 
intimate with their professor. That's why I encourage them to take their 
biology classes now, because it's an advantageous situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Roark does not expect the small-school atmosphere to remain long; university 
officials project that enrollment will increase 260% by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Many Cal State San Marcos students, whose average age is 30, are returning to 
complete degrees -- not for professional advancement, but purely for 
self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps you going and active, and it's challenging," said Julie Bose, who is 
in her 60s and returning for her history degree after a 45-year absence from 
academia. 
</P>
<P>
"I could stay at home and stagnate, but the world's too exciting to just stand 
by," Bose said. 
</P>
<P>
As classes opened, faculty members were still settling into their cubicles. The 
complex of work spaces, set up just recently, bore a strong resemblance to a 
maze. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find your way through, you get a piece of cheese at the end," Roark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyday I walk in here and there's a new cubicle, there's a new desk or I'm 
introduced to someone new," said Len Jessup, assistant professor of business. 
"The standard operating procedure is that there isn't one, and you just do your 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Bell, who set up but did not design the cubicle arrangement, said the 
logistics of operating the university are going about as smoothly as expected. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be too organized when people are still coming in and aren't sure 
what they want," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the relatively smooth sailing of the first day of classes resulted from 
weeks of planning by staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week everyone was literally running like crazy, and I told them the 
reward came Monday when we see the students," said Patricia Farris, business 
services director who arrived at work an hour early to make second and third 
checks of the classrooms. "And, in a minute, I'm going to go reward myself."

CENSUS PUTS STATE NEAR 30 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
With mushrooming growth in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Valley and 
major cities, California gained 5.6 million residents in the last decade and 
reinforced its standing as the country's most populous, ethnically diverse and 
politically powerful state, according to preliminary U.S. Census figures 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
California grew by 24%, bringing its total population to just under 30 million, 
the census figures showed. Officials said the figures are subject to adjustment 
and will not become final until early 1991, 
</P>
<P>
but California's population gain is expected to be the largest among the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the growth, California stands to gain seven congressional seats, 
which would make it the first to have more than 50 elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 congressional elections, California will probably choose 12% of the 
435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. That would be the largest 
percentage chosen by any state since 1860, when New York elected 13% of the 
House. California's increased influence in Congress would also be felt in the 
presidential elections. The state would cast 54 electoral votes, more than 
one-fifth of the 270 needed to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Although the population explosion could benefit the state through increased 
federal funding and political power, experts said it also will aggravate a 
number of the state's problems, including crowded schools, an inadequate 
transportation network and deteriorating air and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"California is changing more than any society in this nation," said Alan 
Heslop, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College and an authority on 
population trends. 
</P>
<P>
About one in nine U.S. residents now live in California, giving the state more 
people than Canada or Australia and all but 28 of the world's countries. In the 
last decade alone, one-fourth of the U.S. population growth has occurred in 
California, according to a study released earlier this year by the Palo 
Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the state's growth in the 1980s was the result of immigration 
from foreign countries and other states, and about half was because births in 
the state exceeded deaths, the study said. The state's combined population of 
Latinos, Asians and African-Americans is expected to make up 40% of its 
population in the final 1990 census and nearly 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Though San Diego County's population growth over the past decade -- an increase 
of 604,000 residents, or 32% -- was the second highest in the state in sheer 
numbers, that growth is unlikely to have a major economic impact on local 
governments, city and county administrators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that most state and federal funds received by the city of San Diego are 
not based on population, City Manager John Lockwood said the census figures 
"probably won't make a significant difference at all," either in city's 
revenues or services. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, it means about $25 a head per year," Lockwood said. "But most of 
our expense and revenue numbers are fixed. Regardless of the growth, we're 
still going to have the same number of parks and libraries, the same number of 
police officers. It's not a big thing for us." 
</P>
<P>
Although more county funds stem from population-based programs, the growth's 
effect on those finances will also be minimal, county officials said. Because 
existing allocations are based on the state's annual population estimates, the 
only additional money that might be forthcoming to the county would stem from 
the incremental difference between the estimated and actual population. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get a small adjustment, but it won't be like getting 32% more all at 
once -- unfortunately," said June Komar, a deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Leon Williams also stressed that, if anything, the growth 
could worsen the county's already serious fiscal constraints, with additional 
service demands outpacing whatever extra funds become available. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the additional money never meets the rising expectations," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the region's dramatic growth, it is unclear whether San Diego County 
will gain any of the state's new congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the county's existing four districts -- Rep. Ron Packard's 43rd District 
and Rep. Duncan Hunter's 45th District -- cross county lines, into Orange and 
Imperial counties, respectively. In addition, Rep. Jim Bates' 44th District has 
grown beyond the national average and will need to be reduced in population, 
creating a surplus that might be shifted into other existing local districts -- 
complicating the potential addition of a seat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility, but it's far from guaranteed," said Bates (D-San Diego). 
"A lot depends on who's elected governor." Although the Legislature will 
redesign the congressional districts to reflect the population growth, the 
governor can play a key role in helping to decide where those new seats are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary census does not break down the population by ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among the state's growth leaders is Riverside County, which grew 72% in the 
decade, with its population jumping from 663,000 to 1.1 million. Riverside 
County and San Bernardino County, which grew by 56%, made the Inland Empire the 
fastest-growing major metropolitan area in the nation, according to census 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County officials have long anticipated that about 1.4 million 
residents would be counted in the 1990 census, Assistant County Administrator 
Lynn Kirkhofer said. "There are a whole slug of state and federal programs that 
are census-based, from job-training to special welfare programs to economic 
development money to road money. That's why this validation is so very 
important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Supervisor Norton Younglove said: "Quite frankly, it's an 
honor I'd just as soon have done without. (Growth) has come too fast." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the state's most spectacular growth also occurred in the Sierra Nevada 
foothills. Placer County grew fastest, with an increase of about 54,000 people 
or 46%. To the south, Tuolumne County grew by just over 14,000 people, or 42%. 
In Central California, Stanislaus County grew by about 101,000 people, or 38%. 
</P>
<P>
This growth is causing changes that are not always welcome, as evident in 
Tuolumne County, where a boom in new construction is accompanied by traffic 
jams. "We have a lot of people coming in from urban areas," said Bev Shane, the 
county's assistant director of planning. "They love open spaces but they also 
want shopping centers and other types of growth." 
</P>
<P>
By sheer numbers of people, Los Angeles County experienced the greatest influx, 
with an increase of 1,242,000, followed by San Diego County's growth by 604,000 
people. Among the slowest-growing areas in the state are San Francisco, with a 
5% growth rate, and Marin County, with 2%. One Marin city, Sausalito, actually 
lost 7% of its 1980 population, declining from 7,338 to 6,857, although Mayor 
Annette Rose said the drop was probably due to miscounting the several hundred 
residents living on houseboats or in obscure rural areas. She said census 
takers made a similar error in 1980 and the city's population had to be revised 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County grew by 33%, Sacramento County by 31%, Fresno County by 28%, 
Orange County by 24%, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties by 23% and Contra 
Costa County by 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fastest-growing cities in the state was Palmdale, where a 330% growth 
rate took the city from a paltry 15,197 to 65,357, making it one of many desert 
communities north and east of Los Angeles that are attracting former city 
dwellers in search of affordable housing. Fresno was second among larger 
cities, with a population increase of 61%, followed by Stockton with 36%, 
Sacramento 32%, San Jose with 22%, Los Angeles with 15% and Oakland with 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The census count in 41 of the 46 states that received their preliminary figures 
has been about 1.6% below the Census Bureau's own projections, with California 
a notable exception, said Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a 
political consulting firm that specializes in the census. California's figure 
is estimated to be one-tenth of 1% below the census projections, Brace said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz said she believes that 
minorities and the homeless are still being undercounted in Los Angeles. For 
example, she said, 70,000 census mailings initially went undelivered in 
South-Central Los Angeles alone, while 31% of the area's census data was 
gathered second-hand from neighbors rather than directly from residents. 
"That's darn bad," she said.

TWO SAN DIEGANS FLEE IRAQ -- HOW REMAINS UNCLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Nasir Hirmiz, 28, was supposed to be back at work Monday for an irrigation 
parts manufacturer in El Cajon after having taken a few weeks off to visit his 
parents in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that he didn't show up was the least of the thoughts of his 
co-workers. The big news was that, earlier that day, he had escaped from Iraq 
with another San Diegan, Lee Jacob, who was visiting his parents in Baghdad as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We were worried about Jim (as Hirmiz is known to his friends) because we 
hadn't heard from him. We hadn't even gotten a post card," said Donna Aiken, 
the personnel director at Hardie Irrigation in El Cajon, where Hirmiz has 
worked for the past three years. "We've missed him! We want him back! He's a 
character. He's a lot of fun to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Both Hirmiz and Jacob, who are Iraqi-born Americans, drove into the dusty 
Jordanian border post of Ruweished from Iraq on Monday, leading a contingent of 
30 or more Americans who were fleeing Iraq, a U.S. diplomat told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The details of their escape -- and the circumstances that allowed them to cross 
the border while tens of thousands of other Westerners remained trapped within 
Iraq -- remained unclear Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had spent several weeks at their parents' Baghdad apartments, 
hiding out for fear they would be detained by Iraqi authorities if found. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terrified," Hirmiz told Reuters after crossing the border into Jordan. 
"We were staying at our parents' homes when the U.S. Embassy called, saying we 
could leave within the next two weeks. We left the first day we could because 
we thought the Iraqis might change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Jacob, a computer programmer, told Reuters: "We just want to go home, very, 
very bad. I couldn't believe how unlucky I was to go to Iraq for a holiday at 
such a time. It frightened me the way they (Iraqis) were going on against the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just innocent civilians," he said. "But I must say no one came to 
bother me, perhaps because I was at home all the time. I lost 15 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Jacob said the U.S. consul in Baghdad had told him to stay off the streets 
because on two occasions Arab-looking American passport holders had been picked 
up and forcibly conscripted. 
</P>
<P>
He said he went Sunday to an Iraqi government office to receive his exit permit 
-- and saw about 500 other Americans there trying to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the two Americans had safely arrived in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers of Hirmiz said they did not know Lee Jacob, and said they assumed 
that the two men probably didn't even know each other until their paths crossed 
in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Gaffney, Hirmiz's boss at Hardie Irrigation, said Hirmiz last visited Iraq 
about nine years ago -- just about a year after Hirmiz left his parents as an 
18-year-old and came to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmiz planned to spend four weeks or so with his parents in Baghdad and left 
in late July, Gaffney said. "He left before anything back there had happened. 
There wasn't a hint of any problems yet. He went back for a leisurely visit." 
</P>
<P>
But, after Iraq invaded Kuwait earlier this month, co-workers grew concerned 
for Hirmiz's safety, but, at the same time, were confident that he had enough 
charm and skill to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We were taking bets on when he would escape," Gaffney said. "He's a pretty 
smooth guy." 
</P>
<P>
The last information anyone had of Hirmiz's whereabouts and safety was about 10 
days ago, when Hirmiz's roommate reported to his co-workers that he was safe at 
the home of his parents, who didn't want him to leave for fear he would be 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they'd be upset if he tried to get out, but he's the kind of guy who 
thinks for himself," Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Aiken: "He doesn't like to be pushed around or told what to do. After 
all, he's a (production) supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmiz's co-workers said they still haven't talked to him and don't know when 
he is expected to return to San Diego.

2 HURT AS LIGHT PLANE CRASHES ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A World War II-vintage airplane crashed onto California 163 Monday, injuring 
the plane's two occupants and forcing authorities to close northbound lanes of 
the freeway for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a single-engine, four-seat Navion once used for training military 
pilots, crashed shortly after taking off from Montgomery Field about 1 p.m., 
said Miguel Duenas, an operations assistant at the city-owned airfield. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Lawrence David Smith, 51, and his passenger, Wayne Gibson, 60, both 
of San Diego, were taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital. Both were listed in 
serious but stable condition with back injuries, said Gwen Barnett, a 
spokeswoman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane began to surge and appeared to lose power soon after 
it became airborne, said Joe Garrison, a field operations officer for the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"The tower saw them take a dive," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane touched down less than a mile from the airport, skidding across the 
four northbound lanes of California 163 south of the Balboa Avenue exit before 
striking the concrete center divider. 
</P>
<P>
When the crash occurred, the plane was probably going about 35 m.p.h., Garrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters reached the scene "within two minutes," said Capt. Al Macdonald of 
the San Diego Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The plane did not hit any cars on the freeway, and there was no fire. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a fire, we would have had two deceased people on our hands," 
Macdonald said. "No cars were hit, which is a miracle in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Because Smith and Gibson were trapped, rescuers were forced to remove the 
plane's canopy to pull them from the cockpit, Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers moved quickly to divert traffic off the northbound lanes of the 
freeway at its interchange with Interstate 805. Firefighters doused the crash 
area with a fire-retardant chemical as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 40 firefighters and 15 CHP officers responded to the accident, 
along with an unknown number of San Diego police officers. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 p.m., workers loaded the plane onto a flatbed truck and hauled it back 
to Montgomery Field for inspection by federal aircraft crash investigators. 
Minutes later, CHP officers reopened the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reynolds, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, said the cause of 
the accident was not known. The plane's destination also was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Duenas said the plane was regularly stored at Montgomery Field, and Smith was a 
co-owner of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the damage to its nose cone, the plane appeared to have been in very 
good condition externally, Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Navion planes were used to train military pilots during World War II, and 
production of Navion models continued into the late 1940s, Macdonald said, 
adding, "They're like Cadillacs, they're built real strong." 
</P>
<P>
After emergency personnel and reporters gathered near the scene, an altercation 
apparently broke out between a police officer and a television news cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
While Channel 8 reporter Gina Lew was reporting on the crash live from nearby 
Kearny Villa Road, an officer climbed on top of the station's van, covered the 
TV camera's lens with his hand, and pushed it away from the scene, Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
Lew said the officer told the camera crew that its van was obstructing traffic 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of surprised," Lew said. "We think (the officer) overreacted."

COUNTY TO GIVE CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS; 
</P>
<P>
AID: THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAM, BEING HAILED AS A NATIONAL MODEL, IS DESIGNED TO 
SAVE MONEY AND BOOST SELF-ESTEEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an innovative program designed to save money and increase the self-esteem of 
food stamp recipients, San Diego County will begin distributing cash instead of 
coupons Sept. 1, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Called a "full cash-out implementation," the program is being hailed by county, 
state and federal officials as a model for national welfare reform, said 
officials familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams and other officials said that 
giving food stamp clients cash instead of coupons will reduce program costs 
while increasing the recipients' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
They said they expect no more fraud than under the current food stamp program, 
which has spawned a black market in which the coupons trade for less than their 
face value. Under the new system, recipients will need proper identification to 
cash the checks issued by the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county Department of Social Services, 46,000 households and 
about 139,000 people receive food stamp assistance in San Diego County, the 
fifth most populous in the United States. The county proposed the ambitious 
plan to state and federal officials last year and initiated a pilot program 
involving 20% of the county's food stamp clients in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program was a huge success, Williams said, and the county received 
the federal government's approval to expand the program to include all food 
stamp households. 
</P>
<P>
An official announcement is expected today by federal, state and county 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
County officials familiar with the plan say it will save $600,000 in 
administrative costs at the state, county and federal levels between September 
and next July, when the new fiscal year begins. The cost of the food stamp 
program in the county, now about $67 million a year, is funded entirely by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
By mailing food stamp clients a monthly check instead of coupons, the county 
saves thousands of dollars in postage for the 590,000 food stamp packets it 
mails each year. In addition, the county will be able to close its food stamp 
issuance center and will no longer have to pay an armored transport company to 
handle the coupons. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot program was such an overwhelming success last year. We projected a 
savings of $86,000 but saved $150,000 instead," said a county official who 
asked not to be named before the announcement planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
This source and others predicted that the new cash-out program will become a 
model for the rest of the country, much like the workfare program, which also 
originated in San Diego County in the 1970s. Under workfare, adults able to 
work are required to perform some sort of public service in order to receive 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Workfare was a pioneer program that was eventually adopted by the state and 
federal governments. A lot of people predict the cash-out program will 
eventually go the same way as workfare," the county official said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Williams and other officials said that giving food stamp clients 
cash instead of coupons will reduce cost while increasing the recipients' 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Food stamps put a person at a disadvantage. It's a put-down and a humiliating 
thing to have food stamps in a grocery line," Williams, who championed the 
cash-out program, said in a telephone interview. " . . . You have to take away 
factors that diminish a person. You have to give a person back his or her 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics within the Social Services Department have warned that giving food 
stamp recipients cash instead of coupons might lead to more abuse of the 
program and eventually increase its cost. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, food stamp coupons can be used only to purchase food, not liquor, 
cigarettes or other non-food items. A cash-only program will make it impossible 
to monitor how the money is being used, said one Social Services employee, who 
did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
However, Williams and other county sources said they are confident that the 
cash-out program will not be abused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see where giving them food stamps instead of cash is any protection to 
society," Williams said. "Anybody can abuse their resources. . . . Some people 
were (so) humiliated at having to use stamps that they would sell them for 50 
cents on the dollar to get cash to buy groceries." 
</P>
<P>
"There have always been abuses," said another county source. " . . . Now there 
are no strings attached. But we're confident that most people, the overwhelming 
majority, will use the cash honorably. Just like they used the food stamp 
coupons honorably. We have confidence in them."

LANDOWNERS WORRY ABOUT REZONE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some Ojai landowners are worried their property values will plummet if the city 
adopts a new zoning plan to drastically cut the commercial development allowed 
on the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say controls are needed to limit traffic, preserve open space 
and curtail creeping commercialism along Maricopa Highway. 
</P>
<P>
After three years and several public workshops, the Ojai Planning Department 
has released a comprehensive document called the Maricopa Specific Plan that 
would cover 383 parcels, including 1,100 acres of private and public land 
surrounding Maricopa Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is proposed for incorporation into the city's General Plan early next 
year, but would require rezoning some areas of Meiners Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Davis of Ventura, who owns vacant property along El Roblar Drive in 
Meiners Oaks said he has been watching with some concern as the plan developed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they downgrade, it could cause a hardship on me," Davis said. "That's OK to 
have Ojai stay downtown, but they should leave Meiners Oaks alone." 
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the stricter zoning would cut the amount of commercial building 
space allowed within the 1,100-acre area, from 35-million square feet under the 
current General Plan to about 2-million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
And the 285,490 daily vehicle trips expected on Ojai roads by 2010 under the 
current scenario could be slashed to 21,852 under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Planning Director William Prince said the plan will allow landowners some 
trade-offs, such as clustering residences to preserve open space. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it should be a surprise that any new plan would result in 
downzoning," Prince said. "We've had 10 years of accumulated development and 
environmental impacts that have taken place since the General Plan was adopted 
in 1979." 
</P>
<P>
Half the acreage in the planning area is on four parcels owned by Ojai Valley 
Inn and Country Club, Villanova Preparatory School, Krotona Institute of 
Theosophy and the Krishnamurti Foundation of America. Those lands would all be 
rezoned to 40-acre minimum lots that must include 75% open space. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-day public review for the document will end Oct. 26. The Ojai Planning 
Commission is expected to hold the first public hearing on the draft plan and 
its environmental impact report in early November. THIA BELL

FAIR ATTENDANCE ON PAR WITH '89 FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Fair's general manager said Monday that overall attendance 
at this year's 12-day event was "about even" with that at last year's, even 
though previously stated figures for 1989 were substantially higher than those 
announced for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to compare this year's overall figures with those that were 
reported in the past," said Michael Paluszak, who replaced former General 
Manager Jeremy Ferris in December. 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak said last year's overall attendance figure of 306,040 was "a bit 
inflated." That figure was included in the fair's official 1990 press brochure. 
</P>
<P>
This year's total attendance was 273,525, said Teri Raley, a spokeswoman for 
the fair. That figure is 32,515 less than last year's announced total. 
</P>
<P>
This year's paid attendance was reported as 182,027 -- 1,568, or slightly less 
than 1%, more than last year's 180,459. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost have to have the same people reporting overall attendance numbers 
every year if the comparison is to be meaningful," Paluszak said, explaining 
why he contends that overall attendance was not down this year. 
</P>
<P>
"You can accurately track paid attendance by the turnstile clicks, but you can 
only estimate how many people get in with passes, and it's impossible to know 
what method was used to make the estimates in previous years." 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak's assistant manager, Arthur Amelio, agreed that overall attendance 
estimates "may have been on the optimistic side" in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue totals for the fair were not available Monday, but Paluszak estimated 
that the event's four major money-generating activities -- ticket sales, 
carnival rides, concessions and parking -- all showed improvement this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Amelio said this year's revenues were expected to exceed 
$2.3 million, compared to last year's $2 million. Still, the fair, which lost 
$500,000 in 1989, was not expected to show a profit this year. 
</P>
<P>
The fair's closing night Sunday was marred by a power outage across about a 
third of the grounds at 8:30 p.m. The mishap occurred when a cluster of 
metallic balloons broke loose and became entangled in overhead lines. 
</P>
<P>
Several exhibition halls were without lights until about 10 p.m., two hours 
before closing time, because of the resulting short circuit, Amelio said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt, and the fair's carnival rides, which were powered by 
independent generators, were not affected, Amelio added. 
</P>
<P>
This year's biggest fair crowd was 32,456 -- 25,135 of it paid attendance -- on 
Aug. 18. JACK SEARLES

COURT UPHOLDS CONVICTION OF KILLER HIGH ON COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

A Spring Valley man, Francisco Urias Uriarte, was appropriately convicted of 
two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder in the 1987 shootings 
of four people, a state appellate court in San Diego ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte was high on cocaine and crazy in the common sense of that term but not 
legally insane when he killed two people and wounded two others Oct. 15, 1987, 
the 4th District Court of Appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
The case pointed up the difficulty the legal system can encounter in criminal 
cases involving a defense based on a diminished mental state, said Justice 
Howard Wiener, who wrote the opinion. He said the case "appears to fall into a 
legal crack." 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte was convicted in March, 1989, of murdering Jeff Constantino, 37, and 
his wife, Nancy, 36, who were visiting a friend and neighbor of Uriarte's at a 
Spring Valley apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte went to the apartment of John Alva looking for his wife, who he 
believed was being held captive there. She actually was in a Tijuana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After being told she was not there, Uriarte, who was under the influence of 
cocaine, left, but returned to Alva's apartment with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
He opened fire on Jeff and Nancy Constantino, killing them both. He then shot 
and wounded Alva, who was trying to flee. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the complex, Uriarte shot and wounded another man in the 
neighborhood, Tom Eberwein. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Bernard Revak sentenced Uriarte in April, 1989, 
to the maximum possible term, 38 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
According to psychiatrists who testified at his trial, Uriarte's mental state 
at the time of the killings was marked by delusions and was a "temporary 
cocaine psychosis" that would generally last as long as the cocaine did. Any 
insanity dissipated as the cocaine itself dissipated, the psychiatrists said. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte claimed that he honestly -- if unreasonably -- believed the killings 
were necessary to prevent harm to his wife. But, Wiener said, even if Uriarte 
thought his wife was in danger, that did not justify the use of lethal force, 
because it was not clear that Uriarte believed the harm to his wife was 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
And though Uriarte may have been delusional, that did not amount to legal 
insanity, so his conviction could not be reversed, Wiener said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Uriarte was "concedely 'crazy' " in the ordinary sense of that word, he 
was without a legal defense, Wiener said, and the case fell into a "legal 
crack." 
</P>
<P>
Under a "more enlightened" legal definition of insanity, Uriarte might be 
"legally as well as colloquially insane," Wiener said. But courts, he said, are 
bound to work "within the present system with its present limitations." 
</P>
<P>
Justices Don R. Work and Charles W. Froehlich Jr. concurred in the opinion.

<P>
Students working toward master's degrees through UC Santa Barbara's off-campus 
studies department will no longer go to the Point Mugu Navy base for classes 
but will use the school's Ventura Center beginning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate programs have been offered at Point Magu in computer science and 
electrical and computer engineering. Space became available in the Ventura 
Center at 3585 Maple St. about two years ago, when classes from Cal State 
Northridge were moved to their own facility. 
</P>
<P>
The graduate program could not move earlier because it had a yearlong contract 
with the Navy, student affairs officer Judy Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is geared toward re-entry students with an average age of about 35, 
Cotton said. LAURA PITTER

<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has approved paying the county Sheriff's 
Department up to $2,800 to add off-road motorcycle patrols on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is about 60% of the cost of the program; the remainder has been 
allocated by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The off-road program was added because of an increase in illegal off-road use 
and dumping, officials said.

300 TREES GIVEN TO STRAPPED SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley Unified School District officials said Monday that they have 
received a donation of 300 trees for the district's 26 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very appreciated," said Mary Beth Wolford, assistant superintendent for 
business and property management. 
</P>
<P>
Wolford said the whole community will benefit from the trees, which cost their 
donor about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Glen N. Gessford, president and part owner of the Big Sky Movie Ranch, said he 
decided to donate the trees to the district when he learned it had little money 
for landscaping after installing water-saving irrigation systems at several 
campuses. Gessford also supplied four workers to plant the trees, which are 
being distributed this week to schools according to need, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gessford said he thought the trees would make the schools more attractive while 
providing a more comfortable environment for students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives a place color," Gessford said of the trees. "It gives it a certain 
feel. This is California." 
</P>
<P>
Wolford said workers began digging holes for the trees last week and were 
planting them Monday. Wolford said white alder, silk oak, sycamore, black pine 
and California pepper are among the types of trees that were donated. 
</P>
<P>
Gessford said the trees are 3 to 5 years old and average about 15 feet in 
height, with most expected to grow to 30 to 50 feet when they reach maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," said Leslie Frank, principal of Simi School, the first school 
to have new trees. The elementary school got two white alders and three 
acacias. Frank said she hoped the donation would show parents and students how 
the community can work together to improve conditions at the schools, which 
have been hit hard by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Wolford said the trees should all be planted before school starts Sept. 5.

FIREFIGHTERS PICKET OUTSIDE CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated over 14 months of unsuccessful contract negotiations with the city, 
Oxnard firefighters began picketing in front of City Hall on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gallaher, president of the firefighters union, said that, while the 
picketing will continue at least through today, he was not sure how long the 
demonstration will go on after that. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations broke off two weeks ago and have not resumed. Both sides 
said no further negotiations are scheduled. While the City Council met inside 
City Hall on Monday to consider a new general plan, four firefighters wearing 
street clothes and carrying picket signs paced up and down outside. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations broke off when the council rejected a contract proposal Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gallaher, both sides have agreed on a salary package similar to a 
two-year contract approved in July by another city employees union. That 
contract called for a 9.3% salary increase over two years, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gallaher said, negotiations deadlocked because firefighters want the 
city to increase their pay when they temporarily fill in for an ill or 
vacationing fire engineer or captain. 
</P>
<P>
The city has offered to include such a clause but only if firefighters 
eliminate a clause that allows firefighters with the most seniority to bid for 
vacant slots within the department, an exchange firefighters say is 
unacceptable. HUGO MARTIN

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS ISSUE VOTE ON JUNGLELAND PROJECT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $63-million project would convert the Jungleland site into a civic 
centerpiece in Thousand Oaks. The city has approved Civic Center plans, but a 
disagreement over the 
</P>
<P>
price of the land and an attempt to place the matter before voters persist. 
Proponents and opponents of the project both claim that a 1986 ballot measure 
backed their views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dick Booker Activist 
</P>
<P>
My answer is definitely yes. The public should be allowed to vote on a project 
of that magnitude. It is my understanding the cost will be far greater than $63 
million, because that figure does not include the cost of the land. That could, 
I am told, run as high as $25 million. When you include the debt service for 
the bonds the city sold to finance Jungleland the total cost to the public 
could be in excess of $100 million. I do know that a lot of people in the 
community have been offended by Jungleland. The proposed project was turned 
down twice. In 1984 and in 1986 the voters rejected it. They were advisory 
issues so the city was able to ignore them. Certainly the people have expressed 
their views on this project. This is a private/public joint venture and they 
propose to build a hotel, office building and retail businesses on the site and 
they intend to subsidize them with public money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alex Fiore Thousand Oaks mayor 
</P>
<P>
I think it's an unfair question. If the issue were simple enough to require a 
yes or no answer, then it would be put on the ballot. In fact, it was on the 
ballot and it was passed. Measure B, three or four years ago and it passed -- a 
60/40 margin. But the question is more complicated now. It's the location, the 
size, the traffic. You see the committee is not asking one question on this 
whole complex, they're asking many questions and that's the only way to get a 
consensus and the only way to satisfy everyone. It's like a cafeteria type of 
proposition. Do you want a 200-room hotel? A 1,400-seat auditorium? A 30-room 
hotel? How much office space do you want? It is very complicated. You could put 
thousands of questions on the ballot. We've had citizen input committees giving 
us opinions on what we're doing and what they wanted. We had a Jungleland 
committee composed of 21 citizens. Seven gave us input on the park, seven on 
the auditorium and seven on the conference center they are thinking about. 
We've taken all that input and we're putting it on the project. We've had 
literally dozens of meetings. The opposition is strictly political, and people 
are having a difficult time seeing through that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larry Horner Thousand Oaks city councilman 
</P>
<P>
Over the last couple of years when I was mayor, I had highly recommended that. 
Because of the magnitude of the project and because of the uncertainty of the 
lawsuit that's pending on the land issue and because of the overall relative 
cost, the residents should have an opportunity to vote on it. . . . There were 
two petitions passed around a little over a year ago where 10,000 resident 
voters said they would like to have the issue placed on the ballot and 10,000 
people from various and sundry places, not necessarily residents, said they did 
not want the issue on the ballot. Because of a technicality, the City Council 
chose not to put the issue on. . . . Another consideration is the fact that the 
developers of the hotel, the Lowe Corp., have asked the city to advance them on 
a loan basis $2 million start-up money. I voted against that. . . . I am 
favorably supportive of a civic auditorium that we can afford, and I'm working 
to help achieve that. My feeling is we better stop now, take the loss, regroup 
and then come back in with something more acceptable to the vast majority of 
the people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steve Rubenstein Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce president 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the entire plan has presented itself, the electorate has enough 
information to make an intelligent decision. The various items could be 
presented on a ballot. For example, the public portion of the project versus 
the private portion of it. Or there could be a question on the visual impact. 
The chamber does support the public portion of the Jungleland project. We're 
not in support of the current plan where the city would subsidize the private 
portion because that's government taxpayer money supporting competition in the 
private sector. . . . This is taxpayer money. The free enterprise system says 
you're free to go out, take money and take a risk. And in this particular 
instance there is no risk. It would be guaranteed to succeed because it would 
be a public entity that is competing with the private sector. . . . If a group 
of investors got together to build the hotel, and they were not going to get 
special consideration, we would have no problem with it whatsoever. A properly 
worded ballot initiative would allow citizens to vote on all or part of the 
project. I don't know why they're pushing so hard. And I'm wondering if the 
hotel is the right thing to be there for a well-rounded project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Madge L. Schaefer Ventura County supervisor 
</P>
<P>
The issue was put on the ballot twice before, and the council ignored the 
result, based on a technicality, and I think that's really regrettable. They 
ignored the result because they didn't get the answer they wanted. I don't 
think it is too late to stop the project. The ground hasn't been broken, and 
the price hasn't even been established on the property. My concern has been the 
size of it and I would have been supportive of having, for instance, smaller 
auditoriums, one built at the high school and perhaps a larger civic 
auditorium. But this has become a very grand scheme, a very expensive project. 
I've become involved with the Alliance for the Arts because it looks like the 
majority of the council is determined that they're going ahead with this 
regardless of the consequences, and so the Alliance for the Arts would provide 
subsidies that would allow local groups to use the facility. The plans for the 
auditorium are so large, local groups would be precluded from using it just 
because of cost. And so in essence what you're doing is using public tax 
dollars to subsidize production companies, and I just don't see that as an 
appropriate role for government. This kind of facility should not be heavily 
subsidized.

<P>
The general in charge of transporting U.S. troops and materiel to the Persian 
Gulf will be the main speaker at the Sept. 8 dedication of the Channel Islands 
Air National Guard base at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Gen. Hansford Johnson, commander in chief of the U.S. Transport 
Command and Military Airlift Command, heads a long list of military and 
political leaders expected for the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. David L. Corrick, a base spokesman, said Johnson is expected to discuss the 
importance of the Air National Guard in the Persian Gulf mobilization. Air 
National Guard reservists are expected to make up nearly a third of the 49,703 
military reserves authorized for active duty last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands base, home of the 146th Tactical Airlift Command, already 
has been tapped for 45 volunteer reservists for medical evacuation duty. Col. 
Daniel H. Pemberton, air commander at the base, has put other reservists based 
there on a "heightened state of awareness" because of the possibility of 
further call-ups. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 full-time Air National Guard personnel are attached to the Channel 
Islands base, as well as 1,100 part-time reservists. About half of the 
personnel live in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The $80-million, 260-acre Channel Islands base opened in April, replacing a 
crowded, 40-acre facility at Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The base is just north of the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, and its 16 C-130 
Hercules cargo planes use the naval station's runway. GARY GORMAN

<P>
The Simi Valley PTA Council has been honored by the California State PTA as the 
most outstanding in the state for the 1989-90 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Council President Janice DiFatta said she and the council's 20 board members 
were "beside themselves" after learning they had been selected from about 200 
councils statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an honor to have been considered for the award and then to receive 
it," DiFatta said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has about 10,000 members in 24 units. DiFatta said her organization 
caught the attention of the judges with a wide menu of policies and programs. 
The council created a program to educate parents about substance abuse, work 
habits, teen-age pregnancy and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The council also devised an incentive scheme where points are awarded to PTA 
units based on the number of activities and projects undertaken, reports put 
out, and attendance at Simi Valley Council and district meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley PTA Council was also the state's most outstanding in 1983.

COMPUTER-AIDED TEACHING PRAISED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hueneme Elementary School District's program of delivering computer-aided 
instruction to students in various disciplines was given high praise Monday by 
an outside evaluation prepared during the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of the district's Model Technology School Program focused on the 
three science classrooms, which use everything from computers to video laser 
disks to satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation was conducted through USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Hueneme has one of the most advanced technological programs I have ever seen," 
said Patrick Rooney, who directed the evaluation. "It's an overwhelming benefit 
to the students. Everyone involved should be congratulated for their 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is a retired superintendent of Ventura schools and current professor of 
education at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The report evaluated the program's computer hardware, its teachers, its budget 
management and 12 areas ranging from class environment to the program's 
applicability at the national and international levels. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,100 people, 30 of them from other countries, have visited the program 
since it began seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that student interest in science has jumped dramatically since 
1983 and the technological instruction helped improve attendance of last year's 
139 eighth-graders by 15% over the previous year, Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found a gradual improvement in California Assessment Program 
achievement test scores since the early 1980s to be a result of the "smart" 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said the program has helped students' problem-solving abilities and has 
reduced the number of disciplinary actions by teachers. SCOTT LAWRENCE

DEVELOPER FENCES OFF FRYMAN CANYON TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public access to a popular hiking trail through rustic Fryman Canyon in Studio 
City has been blocked or sharply curtailed by the developer battling 
environmentalists over his plan to build homes there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Betty B. Dearing Trail is out of business," Benjamin M. Reznik, lawyer for 
developer Fred Sahadi, said Monday. A fence, a "no trespassing" sign and an 
armed guard were posted this weekend at the southern entrance to the trail to 
block access, Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's plan to build 26 luxury homes in the 63-acre canyon is opposed by many 
elected officials and a band of environmentalists. Last week, foes gathered 
repeatedly at the site to monitor and sometimes heckle and harass Sahadi's 
crews, which began minor work to prepare for construction in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said the trail was closed to prevent the project's opponents from 
creating problems. Reznik declined to specify what problems he envisioned. "I 
don't want to give them any ideas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was believed the Dearing trail and 32 acres of Fryman Canyon 
land around it had been deeded to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a 
state parks agency, for public open space. 
</P>
<P>
But it was discovered that Sahadi never transferred the title to the 
conservancy. Sahadi's 26-home project is set to be built on the remaining 
acreage. The conservancy is now requesting the state attorney general to sue in 
order to gain the property at a time when the conservancy also is seeking to 
buy the entire Fryman Canyon site from Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports Monday on whether the trail was totally closed. 
</P>
<P>
Fausto Campobianco, an aide to Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said he 
visited the trail Monday morning after receiving complaints from constituents 
and was told by the guard there that his job was to prevent suspicious persons 
from using the trail. "He invited me to go on ahead," the legislative aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, said he checked out similar complaints Saturday and was greeted by 
a guard on the trail who tried -- but failed -- to serve him with a restraining 
order against trespassing. "It's gross intimidation," Edmiston said.

FANCIFUL TO BELIEVE THE U.N. MIGHT HELP?; 
</P>
<P>
IN THIS VERY RISKY ATMOSPHERE, ANYTHING IS WORTH TRYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is easy to underestimate the United Nations, and until very recently it was 
quite safe to do so. More often than not, this underperforming world 
bureaucracy has been a source of infuriation rather than inspiration. If the UN 
has achieved a level of esteem in the eyes of many Americans not much higher 
than, say, a failed savings and loan, it has done so through virtue of its own 
ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
Few problems could pass through its portals without coming out the other side 
virtually unchanged and unimproved. Even the Office of U.N. secretary general, 
which in the hands of a courageous man like Dag Hammarskjold had been shown to 
have considerable potential, lost its luster under the administrations of 
smaller-than-life figures like U Thant and Kurt Waldheim -- who reminded the 
world anew of his limitations when he surfaced this weekend in the Iraq crisis. 
Predictably, Waldheim cut a deal for Austrian hostages with Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
But the winds of change may be sweeping over the U.N., too, what with the 
waning of 45 years of polarization between Moscow and Washington. The world 
body has been on a bit of a roll lately -- with the Security Council voting to 
approve the use of minimum force to back up U.N.-approved sanctions against 
Iraq and with the Middle East peace mission planned for later this week by 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
THE MISSION: Even if its odds of success are at best 1,000-to-1, this is a 
mission that deserves to have been launched -- and which, if there is any 
justice, needs desperately to succeed. For the risks of escalation in an armed 
clash between the forces in the Persian Gulf are great. That many innocent 
Iraqis, Kuwaitis and Western hostages -- not to mention soldiers -- would be 
killed is a given. What's uncertain is where a conflagration would stop: the 
region, sometimes ferociously anti-American, not to mention anti-Israel, is a 
powder keg. 
</P>
<P>
The support of the American people for the defense of Saudi Arabia is 
impressive. So is the world consensus against Hussein. President Bush on Monday 
was right to say that "there is no flexibility on Iraq getting out of Kuwait." 
But that goal is best achieved through world pressure -- diplomatic and 
economic -- as well as the multinational military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
THE SETTLEMENT: The contours of a negotiated settlement aren't that hard to 
envision. While it was appropriate for President Bush at this stage to insist 
that "there is no room for compromise or negotiation" on an Iraqi withdrawal, 
the timetable for, and the modalities of, a retreat by Hussein's army to Iraqi 
territory are appropriate issues for diplomacy. So is the future shape of the 
government of Kuwait. And it is not inconceivable that an end to the embargo 
and security guarantees might be given Baghdad in return for disarmament of its 
chemical-weapons arsenal and other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the military buildup on both sides continues, power shifts -- as 
inevitable as sand falling through an hourglass -- to the warriors. And it's 
possible that Saddam Hussein, caught in the eerie psychosis of the tyrant who 
has gone too far out on the limb of ambition and ego, is incapable of 
recognizing what is best for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
THE HOPE: The world has needed a more active peacekeeping role from the 
heretofore low-profile secretary general, and now there's a chance it will get 
one. Better late than never. But as Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told the 
Egyptian foreign minister Monday, "The countdown is quickening." Is Saddam 
Hussein beyond talking to? Maybe. But it is just possible that a man who almost 
overnight upended an eight-year-war with Iran may also be a man who can quickly 
fold his hand in a crisis but 26 days old. Perez de Cuellar should stay in the 
Middle East as long as it takes to find out if Saddam will listen to reason.

REOPENING WOUNDS, REVISING HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
REWRITING THE TRUTH OF THE INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS DURING THE WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) wants to rewrite some World War II 
history according to his own quirky vision. Worse yet, he wants his inaccurate 
and dangerous version of what happened to Japanese-Americans in those dark days 
included in textbooks used by California schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution that could be voted on today by the Assembly, Ferguson claims 
that national security and military necessity were the reasons that 120,000 
Japanese-Americans were swept away from their homes on the West Coast and 
shipped to internment camps. The resolution also incorrectly states that "it is 
simply untrue that Japanese-Americans were interned in concentration camps 
during World War II . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's attempt to revise history doesn't alter historical fact. Congress in 
1988 voted for reparations in acknowledgement that Japanese-Americans had been 
locked up because anti-Japan sentiment in this country reached a fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The vote for reparations followed a 1982 report by the Commission on Wartime 
Relocation and Internment of Civilians. It concluded that internment "was not 
justified by military necessity and the decisions which followed from it -- 
detention, ending detention and ending exclusion -- were not driven by analysis 
of military conditions. The broad historical causes which shaped these 
decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria and failure of political 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, the Assembly passed a resolution that called for instructional 
materials used in California schools to give "accurate and objective versions 
of the Japanese-American internment experience." 
</P>
<P>
Setting the record straight in educational materials used in California is no 
small matter because these textbooks provide the national standards used by 
textbook publishers and educators throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
California and Texas are the only two states that have an extensive 
textbook-review policy, so they are the models for educational materials. Thus, 
Ferguson's attempt to rewrite history is not only a foolish effort, but a 
potentially harmful one.

PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL AND MIDEAST CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helena Cobban argues that Israel is "irrelevant to the American campaign in the 
gulf, and, at worst, seriously detrimental to it" ("Strategic Ally, Strategic 
Myth," Commentary, Aug. 16). Moreover, she questions the overall value of the 
U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation which has been developed over the past 
decade. She is wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
If Arab readiness to join with the U.S. to counter Iraqi aggression is 
"directly undercut by Iraq's ability to point to the United States as closely 
tied to Israel," then what explains the Administration's ability to garner 
support from virtually every Arab state? Even Yemen and Libya, long-time foes 
of the U.S., appear to have edged closer to the U.S. position. The exceptions? 
Jordan, which continues to attempt to play all sides against the middle in King 
Hussein's never-ending juggling act of survival, and the PLO, which has once 
again exposed its extremism by embracing Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cobban claims that "Arab allies old and new have far more of value to 
offer than Israel," the facts are otherwise. Does anyone seriously believe that 
our current joint efforts with such countries as Libya, Syria or Yemen 
represent anything other than a momentary convergence of strategic interests? 
Or that the U.S. can ever claim shared values with feudal monarchies? 
</P>
<P>
This is not to deny the importance of the collective efforts or the ongoing 
need to encourage the forces of moderation in the region. But they cannot serve 
as a substitute for the breadth and depth of the relations between the U.S. and 
Israel. Whatever its flaws, Israel is the only democratic nation in the region. 
It remains in the U.S. interest to support Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, Cobban attempts to make short 
shrift of it. In doing so, however, she overlooks the incalculable value of 
this cooperation to both sides. Intelligence-sharing, pre-positioning of 
material, access to Israeli ports, assessment of Soviet weapons capabilities, 
joint research and development on new weapons systems, joint combat exercises 
in Israel are part of the link. As U.S. troops amass in Saudi Arabia, preparing 
to face off against an Iraqi army largely equipped with Soviet weapons, the 
benefits of the U.S.-Israel link are considerable. 
</P>
<P>
A tragic aspect of the current crisis may be the realization yet again that the 
old adage -- "my enemy's enemy is my friend" -- simply doesn't apply when it 
comes to Israel. Were it not for their blind hatred of Israel, the more modern 
Arab states might realize that they may have more in common with Israel than 
with expansionist Iraq and its supporters.

PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL AND MIDEAST CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud your editorial "U.S. Should Never Fear to Negotiate" (Aug. 22). A 
peaceful solution is the only solution this country should pursue now that we 
have the military power in place to negotiate from a position of strength. 
</P>
<P>
But we (including the United Nations) should use this window of opportunity to 
put into motion the resolution of whatever problems may have created this 
crisis, or could cause it to simmer and threaten recurrence in another deadly 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, there is the matter of a peaceful resolution of the 
Arab-Israeli-Palestinian problem, i.e., recognition of Israel's right to exist, 
coupled with self-determination for the Palestinians. A militarized Middle East 
bodes ill for the security of the area, so a plan for ultimate disarmament of 
all nations in the area is essential. To insure the peace, at least during the 
transition, a significant U.N. military presence would be essential. And to 
address a major potential for future violence, the monarchies and dictatorships 
should be encouraged to establish a timetable for the phase-in of democratic 
governments.

HENRY J. GREENWALD; RETIRED INSURANCE SALESMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry J. Greenwald, a longtime insurance salesman, has died at his Toluca Lake 
home. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
He died Friday of a heart attack, his son, S. Michael Greenwald, said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Cleveland, Greenwald served in the Army Air Corps during World War 
II. After the war, he moved to California and eventually settled in Toluca 
Lake, where he lived for the past 35 years. He sold workers' compensation 
insurance for most of his life, most recently for Republic Indemnity Co. of 
America in Encino. He retired in 1981. He enjoyed playing the organ and 
belonged to a social group of organists. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald is survived by his son, who lives in Granada Hills; a daughter, 
Kathryn Davis of Woodland Hills; a sister, Ruth Renner of Aurora, Ohio; and 
three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be private. J.T. Oswald Mortuary in North Hollywood is handling 
the arrangements. Donations may be made in Greenwald's name to the Granada 
Hills Hospital Foundation or the American Cancer Society, San Fernando Valley 
unit.

CHERYL KROTT; GLENDALE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale judge, whose dedication to the bench kept her working months after 
surgery for a terminal brain tumor, has died, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Municipal Judge Cheryl Krott died Saturday at her Glendale home, 
presiding Judge Charles Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
She was 48. 
</P>
<P>
Horan and other court officials said Krott was reserved and private, a tough 
but fair judge respected by attorneys for her commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Her brain tumor was diagnosed last August and she underwent surgery in 
September. Yet she returned to work about two weeks later, scheduling painful 
treatment sessions on Fridays so she could rest on weekends to avoid disrupting 
the court's calendar, colleagues said. Krott's tumor eventually returned and 
she left the bench June 22, vowing she would be back. 
</P>
<P>
"She never gave up hope," Karla Olson, the court's administrator, said. "She'd 
come in on Mondays, and you could tell that her treatment had ravaged her. She 
was in pain just putting on her robe. But she'd always stay late on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Krott, born in New York, graduated from Glendale College of Law in 1974. She 
was a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney and deputy public defender 
before becoming a Glendale municipal court commissioner in 1982 and a judge in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her father, Robert Krott, and a sister and a brother, all 
living in New York. Services will be Thursday at 1 p.m. at Forest Lawn 
Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills. Donations on her behalf can be sent to 
the Brain Tumor Research Fund at the UCLA Medical Center, Olson said.

LIMITS ON TV ADS AIMED AT KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found it difficult to read your editorial without snickering. Are you 
kidding? Have you seen what's available on television these days? I suppose by 
limiting advertisements to 12 minutes per hour children will wallow in the 
educational benefits from the remaining 48 minutes of quality programming like 
"Muppet Babies." 
</P>
<P>
Parents aren't going to save their children from "brain death" until they 
finally pull them away from the tube. I think it's time people stop asking 
Congress to solve their own problems and start taking responsibility for their 
parental obligations.

Added to his earlier virulent anti-homosexual statements, we now have his 
racist stance with regard to Japanese Americans who were interned at various

Is Ferguson from the Dark Ages? He obviously has no sensitivity. I cannot

SANTA ANA CIVIC CENTER DISORDER IS A 'BROKEN WINDOW' THAT INVITES MORE 
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR IF NOT FIXED BY POLICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The issue the community of Santa Ana is facing is one of crime and disorder. 
Recently, attention has been focused on events occurring in our Civic Center, 
the seat of Orange County's government. Thousands of people from all walks of 
life frequent the area daily. Workers, schoolchildren, the elderly and 
individuals of all ages are conducting business or enjoying a visit. 
</P>
<P>
When disorderly behavior in the Civic Center or anywhere else goes unchallenged 
the message is clear that no one cares. If allowed to persist, disorder 
escalates and serious crime soon follows. 
</P>
<P>
Urinating in public, drunkenness, aggressive panhandling, rude and sexually 
offensive remarks and vandalism are some of the many disorders witnessed daily 
by people in the heart of our city. The stench of human waste is repugnant; the 
possibility of being accosted is frightening, and an extreme atmosphere of 
disarray is prevalent. The purpose of our enforcement efforts has consistently 
been to reinstate the public order that has noticeably evaporated. We are 
repairing the "broken windows." 
</P>
<P>
Two well-recognized figures in the field of policing, James Q. Wilson and 
George L. Kelling, first documented the "broken windows" phenomenon in an 
article published in 1982. When the first window is broken in a building and it 
is not repaired, the people will conclude that no one cares about the building 
and more windows will be broken. Eventually the building will have no windows 
and the condition will be compounded by more serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when disorderly behavior is allowed to flourish it becomes the 
"broken window." 
</P>
<P>
The level of disorder in the Civic Center is rising. Serious crime, assaults, 
thefts, rapes and robberies are also increasing. Coincident with these 
documented increases in unruly behavior and major wrongdoings has been an 
increase in fear. 
</P>
<P>
Pressing personal concerns have been conveyed to me by the community. Wilson 
and Kelling cite research results which confirm what working police officers 
already know: Even though many people are frightened by crime, especially crime 
involving a sudden, violent attack by a stranger, we cannot overlook or forget 
that a source of substantial, real fear is the dread of being accosted by 
disorderly people, by people who are inebriated, throw trash on the ground, 
openly urinate and defecate in public places, or who aggressively beg. 
</P>
<P>
This fear not only has been related to me as a police chief but also has been 
described in many recent media reports. It is more than mere disapproval of 
offensive behavior. Sociologist Nathan Glazer, describing subway graffiti, 
portrayed its existence as an inescapable knowledge that the environment that 
must be endured has become "uncontrolled and uncontrollable, and that anyone 
can invade it to do whatever damage and mischief the mind suggests." 
</P>
<P>
This fear is based on a visceral intuition, all too frequently confirmed by 
subsequent reality, that when we allow unruly conduct to flourish severe crime 
problems quickly ensue. The reality of serious crime is with the Police 
Department every day. This fuels our fundamental duty to safeguard lives and 
property. 
</P>
<P>
My reaffirmation of the public's control of their space is an emphasis on crime 
prevention. By seeking to decrease the visible signs of disorder, I am striving 
to prevent the Civic Center from becoming a haven for those who are looking for 
easy targets of prey. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, whenever people have lived together they have found it 
necessary to develop rules of conduct. Contemporary American laws, based on 
English common law, may be traced back more than 3,600 years ago to the ancient 
times of Hammurabi. In our democratic society we are governed by the 
Constitution of the United States. Federal, state and local laws are designed 
to maintain order, discourage violence and to safeguard lives and property. 
Police are ethically bound to uphold the laws of the land. 
</P>
<P>
I am not pursuing a campaign to drive any specific group from the Civic Center 
area. My intent and purpose is to reestablish the rules of conduct, which all 
people expect in a civil society. 
</P>
<P>
The standards of behavior I am rebuilding are not ones that have been created 
by the police. We are enforcing norms that have been established by our 
community through their elected representatives, which have been codified in 
ordinances and laws. Observance of these regulations indicates to everyone that 
this space is safe and secure. If anyone doubts that these norms have been 
increasingly unobserved, they need only to ask the many who recently viewed an 
amorous couple mating in full daylight view. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Center was not designed as a campground. It is unfortunate that a 
segment of our society has been driven to seek shelter here. But the police 
must insist that the area is safe for those who are observing our community 
standards of behavior. Continually increasing disorder in the area, left 
unchecked, will not only lead to more serious crime but also certainly 
contribute to the belief that democratic government has become totally futile. 
</P>
<P>
If the very seat of government is characterized by unruliness, how can we be 
expected to police our neighborhoods, or confront the many other problems that 
by consensus we have been asked by our community to address? Our responsibility 
is to maintain order and to prevent future problems by fixing those "broken 
windows" wherever we find them.

JOE MORRIS EXPECTED TO BE AMONG 11 GIANT CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A source within the New York Giants organization said that running back Joe 
Morris will be among the 11 players the team will release today to reach the 
60-man roster limit. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to cut Joe Tuesday," said the source, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no official confirmation from the Giants, Bill Parcells 
indicated Sunday that he was close to making a decision about his running 
backs. "I want to talk to my coaches first," he said. Morris could not be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, 29, is the club's all-time leading rusher with 5,296 yards and 48 
touchdowns. But he missed all of last season with a broken foot and hasn't had 
an impressive camp. He has rushed 20 times for 47 yards, an average of just 2.3 
yards a carry. Many of his rushes have been behind the second-team offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells said that his decision at running back is not just a matter of whom 
he'll keep but also how he'll use them. "Do I have one starter and use him the 
majority of the time? Or do I have enough talent now that I'm going to use two 
or three guys (at halfback)? Right now it looks like we might use more than one 
on a weekly basis. Some of those kids have a lot of ability." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether Ottis Anderson will survive the cut. He has rushed for 31 
yards on 14 carries, a 2.2 average. Youngsters Rodney Hampton (15-141) and 
Lewis Tillman (15-67) have been more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful seventh-round pick Aaron Emanuel will make the club. His injured 
shoulder is a condition that has plagued him since college. Parcells is 
apprehensive about playing Emanuel. "I don't know what I'm going to do with 
him," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Giants beat the Jets, 17-7, Saturday night, Parcells was so 
troubled by the early performance of his offensive line that he summoned the 
unit to Giants Stadium Sunday to "get this straightened out one way or 
another." 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the team had a day off, Parcells had his linemen watch 
videotapes of their performance, which included four sacks allowed, holding 
penalties on Jumbo Elliott, William Roberts and Bart Oates, and two false 
starts. Parcells said his line's play was "not only disturbing, it's a little 
bit alarming." 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't ready to go. They weren't alert," he said. "The Jets ran by them 
early in the game. And penalties ... penalties are the players' fault. I don't 
take the blame for any penalties except for delay of game. They know what the 
rules are. They know they're not supposed to hold." 
</P>
<P>
To get his point across, Parcells did something he hasn't done in six years -- 
call a particular group of players in on their day off. His reasoning: "They're 
not going to like to sit in there and watch the film with the rest of the 
offense, so we'll do it quietly and try to get everything resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Two Giants who excelled Saturday night were defensive back Reyna Thompson and 
linebacker Pepper Johnson. Thompson made two tackles on punt coverage and 
showed some grit by getting into two scuffles with Jets safety Erik McMillan. 
"He's a one-man gang," Parcells said. "He's absolutely the best special-teams 
player I've ever had. They made him mad (Saturday) night. He's the wrong guy to 
make mad." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was annoyed with himself, because dueling with McMillan cost him a 
chance to make another tackle on punt coverage. "I played stupid," Thompson 
said. "I'm trying to get physical and play rough and tough with him and show 
him what Reyna's all about, and I didn't make the play. From now on, I'll go 
down there and make the play, then show him what Reyna's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, meanwhile, likes the new scheme in which he rushes the quarterback. He 
collected two sacks against the Jets and thinks he can get plenty more during 
the season. "If they keep me out there rushing like that, I think I can sneak 
into double digits this year," said Johnson, who has eight sacks in four 
seasons with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Banks on the Giants' defense, which has allowed just 23 points in three 
preseason victories: "It's promising as long as we continue to execute. We're 
not a gambling type of defense, so we have to rely on consistency and hard 
work. If we do that, we'll have a good defense."

Rosa Mota of Portugal won a record third consecutive women's marathon, and 
Salvatore Antibo of Italy dominated the men's 10,000 meters Monday at the 
European Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Mota, 32, the world and Olympic champion, has not lost a major marathon in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared close to defeat after two hours of running. 
</P>
<P>
After building a two-minute margin at 12.4 miles, she was slowed by heat and 
stomach pains. In the next 6.2 miles, Valentina Yegorova of the Soviet Union 
moved within 39 seconds of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Yegorova caught the leader, but Mota stayed with her for just a few strides 
before taking the lead for good and winning by 30 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I started too fast and then I started perspiring heavily because of the heat 
and stomach pains," Mota said. "I realized Yegorova was catching up, so I 
waited for her, thinking I could run better with somebody. But I soon saw she 
was tired and I went into the lead again." 
</P>
<P>
At the end, just five seconds separated the two runners, with Mota finishing in 
2 hours 31 minutes 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Antibo took the lead from the outset and quickly extending it to more than 200 
meters in the 10,000. He came down the homestretch blowing kisses and waving 
happily to the cheering crowd, winning in 27:41.27. In a sprint for second 
place, Are Nakkim of Norway beat Stefano Mei, the defending champion from 
Italy, 28:04.04 to 28:04.46. 
</P>
<P>
In a major upset, Astrid Kumbernuss, 20, of East Germany, competing in her 
first big event, beat Olympic champion and world record-holder Natalya 
Lisovskaya of the Soviet Union in the women's shotput. 
</P>
<P>
Kumbernuss put the shot 66 feet 10 1/2 inches. Lisovskaya was second at 65-9 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Kathrin Neimke of East Germany finished third at 65-6.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the threat of a fighting war in the Persian Gulf temporarily moderating, 
the stock market reversed its downward trend and rallied strongly the past two 
trading sessions, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San 
Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Whether stock prices continue to go up still depends on the depth of recession, 
whether the budget deficit increases and in which direction interest rates go, 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks remained lackluster except for companies that announced stock 
buy-backs. Price Co., which last week fell to a 1990 low of $30.25, closed 
Monday at $34.125 after announcing that its board authorized a purchase of an 
additional $50 million worth of its stock. Under a prior authorization, the 
company had already acquired 1.5 million shares at an average price of $35.92 
</P>
<P>
Cubic Corp. said it was continuing to buy back its own stock with an 
authorization to buy up to 500,000 more shares. This is in addition to the 1 
million shares Cubic purchased over the past five years. Cubic stock gained 
$1.375 after the announcement and, at its current price, is selling at only 4.5 
times its trailing 12-month earnings of $3.66 and at a 20% discount to its book 
value of $20.93 as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The major casualty of the week was Magma Power, which fell $7.25 to close at 
$27.75. This geothermal energy stock is now selling at 25.4 times its trailing 
12-month earnings. The stock, which recently hit an all-time high of $37, 
apparently attracted profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Bancorp has been dropped from the stock listings because its merger 
with Security Pacific Bank has been made final. 
</P>
<P>
Annual meetings this week include GTI today and Intermark and Computer &amp; 
Communications Technology Corp. Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
A conference on life science stocks will be held Sept. 12 at the La Jolla 
Marriott from 4 to 7 p.m. The following San Diego companies will make 
presentations: Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Biomagnetic Technologies, Marrow-Tech 
and Synbiotics. For reservations, call Keith Diffenderffer at 236-0460.

NEW NAME DOESN'T HAMPER FIRM'S CLIMB; 
</P>
<P>
OUTDOOR GEAR: IGNORING ADVICE TO GIVE UP, EMPLOYEES OF TROUBLED CHOUINARD 
EQUIPMENT POOLED RESOURCES AND STARTED OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of outdoor-equipment stores were decidedly pessimistic in the spring of 
1989, when Chouinard Equipment, a Ventura-based maker of rock-climbing gear, 
floated a plan for a new company with a new name that would sell the same line 
of crampons, carabiners, ropes and ice axes Chouinard had sold. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical response was, 'Give up now, don't even try,' " said Peter Metcalf, 
who was Chouinard's general manager at the time. After all, many of the 75 
store owners pointed out, Chouinard's prestige was heavily dependent on its 
founder and owner, climbing guru Yvon Chouinard. A new name and a new company 
might not have the same appeal to climbers. 
</P>
<P>
But with their company in bankruptcy court because of a spate of liability 
lawsuits, Metcalf and some other Chouinard employees -- not including Chouinard 
himself -- decided to go ahead and buy Chouinard's assets last December in a 
leveraged buyout, in which the group borrowed most of the money for the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
And Metcalf claims today that the newly formed company, Black Diamond Equipment 
Ltd., hasn't suffered from the loss of its old prestigious name -- an 
assessment even a competitor agrees on. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, they will pull through and they've done a great job at it," 
said Helmut Lenes, owner of Climb High, a distributor of rock-climbing gear in 
Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
The first public sign that Chouinard was in trouble came in April, 1989, when 
it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, claiming 
that its hand was forced by five lawsuits blaming the company for deaths and 
injuries related to the use of its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard denied the charges, but Lost Arrow, Chouinard's parent company -- 
which owns the well-known Patagonia Inc. clothing company -- believed putting 
Chouinard into bankruptcy reorganization was the only way to protect itself 
from the suits. 
</P>
<P>
At least two of the lawsuits involved the deaths of climbers who were using a 
Chouinard-made harness -- a beltlike device for attaching a climber to the rope 
-- according to a filing by Daniel M. Blumenfeld, a Palo Alto attorney who 
represents plaintiffs in two of the cases in Chouinard's ongoing bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
One of the climbers, Arthur Calkins, a 48-year-old Northern California man, 
died in an accident at Pinnacles National Monument in California in February, 
1989, according to the filing. After Calkins fell more than 100 feet, his 
harness "was found open, hanging near the top of the climb from where he had 
fallen," the filing says. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard has denied responsibility for Calkins' death, but Chouinard's 
attorney in the case did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
As a new company that merely owns Chouinard's former assets, Black Diamond has 
nothing to do with the lawsuits now -- they are the problem of Chouinard 
itself, no longer a going concern, but only a corporation in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
About 42 former Chouinard employees used their retirement accounts for the 
acquisition and now own about 51% of Black Diamond, according to Metcalf, the 
new company's chief executive. The rest is owned by investors and several 
business partners of the company, such as the owner of a French company that 
makes ropes. The group borrowed about 75% of the approximately $2.7 million 
needed to by Chouinard's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf admits that it wasn't easy to borrow the money. But despite an interest 
rate of about 15% on the loan, he said Black Diamond has been paying it off and 
still remaining profitable. 
</P>
<P>
In its final year of operations, Chouinard had sales of about $7 million, and 
Black Diamond's sales for the year ending Aug. 30 will be about 10% higher than 
that, according to Metcalf. 
</P>
<P>
Metcalf said the company has cut costs, such as liability insurance premiums. 
Black Diamond found a Seattle company that specializes in insuring ski resorts 
and other companies involved in high-risk sports that is charging Black Diamond 
only about a third of the $340,000-a-year Chouinard had to pay for nearly as 
much insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Black Diamond has also improved how it documents its quality control 
procedures. And the company now includes elaborate pictorial instructions with 
its products -- if possible, sewn or imprinted right on the equipment. Black 
Diamond also includes explicit warnings with equipment and in its catalogue 
about the dangers of climbing. 
</P>
<P>
To convey to customers the idea of a link between Chouinard and Black Diamond, 
the new company incorporated Chouinard's logo -- a letter "C" framed in a 
diamond -- in its insignia. 
</P>
<P>
So far, climbers seem to have caught on to the Black Diamond name. Climb High's 
Lenes said he did not think his company had taken any of Chouinard's share of 
climbing equipment market. 
</P>
<P>
Lenes isn't exactly sure why. But Metcalf said part of the reason is that Black 
Diamond geared its public explanation of the reorganization to appeal to 
climbers. Black Diamond has tried to reassure climbers that although it is a 
new company, "our collective experience in manufacturing great gear spans 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
Black Diamond also made a pitch to endear climbers to Black Diamond's cause. A 
letter in its recent catalogue begins with the self-deprecating question: "What 
do a bunch of climbers know about leveraged buyouts?"

POST OFFICE ALTERNATIVE CHANGES ITS ROUTE; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCHISING: MAIL BOXES COAST TO COAST HAS HAD A HARD TIME MAKING A PROFIT, BUT 
SELLING ITS LONG ISLAND NETWORK HAS HELPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mail Boxes Coast to Coast Inc. in Encino is the largest franchiser for Mail 
Boxes Etc., the San Diego-based company that has gained attention with its 
nationwide network of post office alternative stores and steady earnings gains. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded in 1980, Mail Boxes Etc. has grown to $25.7 million a year 
in revenues and about $1.5 million in net income. Mail Boxes Etc. stores 
provide the usual postal services, such as letter mailing and private box 
rentals, plus other office and shipping services. 
</P>
<P>
With its 1,300 stores nationwide, Mail Boxes Etc. has practically cornered the 
market on private retail postal services. Its biggest competitor, Pak Mail 
Centers of America in Denver, has 250 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a move that analysts say enhances Mail Boxes Etc.'s credibility, 
United Parcel Service purchased an option to buy at least 17% of Mail Boxes 
Etc. "We clearly see their success and that's what we're investing in," UPS 
spokesman Alan Caminiti said. 
</P>
<P>
But although Mail Boxes Etc. has an impressive track record, Mail Boxes Coast 
to Coast, a separate company that is sort of a smaller clone of Mail Boxes 
Etc., has had a hard time making a profit. Since Coast to Coast was founded in 
1984, it has lost about $1.4 million and has never had a profit for a full 
year, which probably accounts for why its stock closed Monday at 37.5 cents a 
share. Mail Boxes Coast to Coast has the exclusive right to set up franchise 
Mail Boxes Etc. stores in Los Angeles County and Manhattan and now has 105 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
In return for training and help with marketing, advertising and setting up the 
stores, new franchise owners pay Mail Boxes Coast to Coast a onetime $7,800 fee 
and a maximum of $2,000 for overseeing site selection and construction, plus 
ongoing royalty payments of 2.5% of their gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months that ended June 30, Mail Boxes Coast to Coast posted a profit 
of $63,432 on revenues of $377,975. But that profit was due to the sale of its 
Long Island, N.Y., franchise network, which netted the company $251,255. 
Without that onetime gain, Mail Boxes Coast to Coast would have reported a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The figures haven't looked good for a while. After reaching $1.33 million in 
revenues in 1986, Coast to Coast's revenues have declined every year, hitting 
$891,815 in 1989. The company blamed the drop on its decision to sell its three 
company-owned stores to concentrate on building its franchise network. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem was that Mail Boxes Coast to Coast had three big franchise 
areas to sell: Los Angeles, Manhattan and Long Island, and it was one too many. 
The company let its overhead costs and debt get ahead of its ability to cash in 
on a growing stream of royalties. 
</P>
<P>
That's because a large share of a franchiser's costs come when it sells 
franchises to prospective owners, oversees construction or leases and helps the 
owner set up shop. An average Mail Boxes Etc. store takes about six months to 
get its sales up to full speed, meaning Coast to Coast's royalty payments in 
the beginning are often just a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
Now Coast to Coast has opted for a change in strategy. Though it still plans to 
nearly triple the number of franchises in Los Angeles and Manhattan within 
about three years, it is also cutting back. The sale of its 10-store Long 
Island network to Mail Boxes Etc. in June was the first step. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Island wasn't developed as rapidly as we would have liked," said A.W. 
(Tony) DeSio, president and chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc. "I think they 
had too much area and weren't able to effectively develop it all 
simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
The sale helped Coast to Coast cut marketing costs and reduce its long-term 
debt from about $350,000 to less than $40,000. Company executives said they are 
planning more cutbacks that will reduce overhead by $150,000 a year, but they 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The trick now is for Coast to Coast to grow as quickly as possible by selling 
more franchises in Los Angeles and Manhattan -- both high-density areas where 
stores typically do a higher volume of business -- while continuing to keep a 
lid on costs. That way, it can afford to wait out the time it takes for the 
royalties to start rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams, Coast to Coast's president, said the company will turn the 
profit corner as early as next year. "Wherever there's a post office, we'll 
have a store," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, some striking differences between the U.S. Postal Service 
and Mail Boxes Etc. stores. For one thing, the stores don't deliver mail. 
</P>
<P>
But Mail Boxes stores do provide a host of services that post offices don't. 
They are outlets for Ticketron and pickup points for private carriers such as 
Western Union, Federal Express and DHL Airways. They also offer notary 
services, fingerprinting and faxes, make keys, print invitations, wrap packages 
and take passport photos. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes stores look different too. Instead of "Most Wanted" signs, the 
stores have brightly printed posters advertising Christmas card printing and 
stand-up displays with greeting cards and packaging materials. Shelves are 
stuffed with office supplies such as pens, pencils, glue and tape. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the 7-Eleven of business and postal services," said Rick Young, owner of 
the 1,080-square-foot Mail Boxes Etc. in Canoga Park, one of the most 
successful stores in Coast to Coast's network. Young said he caters to 600 to 
800 customers a day and grosses about $27,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary from store to store, but the average markup on postal services is 
10% to 20%. At the Canoga Park store, for instance, Young charges 28 cents for 
a 25-cent first-class stamp. Box rentals, one of the most popular services, run 
anywhere from $12 to $20 a month, depending on the store and the box size. The 
most common size of post office box costs $14 for six months. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike post office boxes, Mail Boxes Etc.'s boxes are accessible 24 hours a 
day and mail can be checked and even read over the phone with the proper 
authorization. Another advantage Mail Boxes Etc. touts is that instead of 
having a "P.O. Box" address, the address is listed as a street and suite number 
-- lending some credibility to small business owners who work out of their 
homes and account for at least half of Mail Boxes Etc.'s business. 
</P>
<P>
For private freight services such as UPS and DHL, Mail Boxes stores charge the 
regular published rates. A DHL letter sent overnight to anywhere in the world, 
for instance, costs $14. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 39, was a musician in 1981 when he read an ad for Mail Boxes Etc. 
Seeking a steadier line of work, he decided to look into becoming a franchiser. 
Using his savings and some backing from Mail Boxes Etc., Williams started a 
franchise network in Phoenix that became so successful that the company asked 
him to sell the Phoenix network and start selling franchises in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Herbert Goffstein, 62, one of Mail Boxes Etc.'s founders and its 
onetime chairman, decided to leave the corporate suite for a more 
entrepreneurial role and in 1984 he and Williams joined forces to sell 
franchises in Los Angeles County. Goffstein is now Coast to Coast's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Williams and Goffstein started the Manhattan and Long Island networks. 
In 1987, they took the company public in an offering of units made up of stock 
and warrants to purchase more stock. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Goffstein together own about 50% of Coast to Coast's stock. 
Williams said he believes that investment will finally start to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to turn the corner," he said.

GRILLS PUT COMPANY BACK IN BLACK; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION: ONCE-AILING AMERICAN RESTAURANTS IS TURNING A PROFIT AFTER BUYING 
HUDSON'S CHAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a Hudson's Grill restaurant, a hamburger costs about $4. The same $4 can buy 
two shares of stock in American Restaurants Corp., which owns the Hudson's 
Grill chain. And that speaks volumes about the problems ARC is trying to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
ARC, based in Ventura, was on its back two years ago. At that time it mainly 
operated 35 Wendy's fast-food franchises, but some sat on expensive real estate 
leases that ate up profits and others lacked strong management. As a result, 
ARC lost $7 million from 1985 through 1988 on sales of roughly $20 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1988, the company hired Charles L. Boppell as president and chief 
executive. A veteran of the fast-food wars, Boppell was a former executive of 
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Godfather's Pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Once he arrived at American Restaurants, Boppell directed the sale of 
two-thirds of its Wendy's restaurants to eliminate the struggling ones. He also 
arranged the purchase of a company that owned several Hudson's Grills, a 
Southern California restaurant chain with a mild 1950s diner theme, sit-down 
service and moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson's appealed to Boppell because it gave him an opportunity to run his own 
business, rather than heading a division or a franchise, and for ARC itself to 
expand the Hudson's concept. 
</P>
<P>
And after shuffling the lineup, Boppell has ARC making money again, its balance 
sheet is healthier and he has big expansion plans. The company -- which owns 12 
Hudson's, 11 Wendy's and four specialty restaurants such as the State &amp; A, 
a sandwiches/bar restaurant in Santa Barbara -- earned $442,000 on sales of $23 
million in the 48 weeks ended Dec. 31. (ARC changed its fiscal year-end to Dec. 
31 from Jan. 31 last year.) In this year's first quarter, it had a $93,616 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it a phoenix company, rising out of the ashes," said Roy J. Millender 
Jr., an ARC director and its biggest stockholder with a 40% stake. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old company also has decided its future is Hudson's, which it owns 
outright, and not in being a Wendy's franchisee, even though its remaining 
Wendy's are profitable. (Among other things, ARC must pay Wendy's 4% of its 
gross sales for extending ARC the franchise.) ARC expects to open 25 more 
Hudson's over the next three years, and it has begun to market franchises. 
</P>
<P>
ARC executives bristle at the suggestion that Hudson's Grills are 1950s diners, 
preferring to say the restaurants "flirt with the 1950s." Why be so 
persnickety? Because ARC does not want to be pigeonholed as a '50s diner. 
Instead, it plans to regularly and subtly change its identity as the years go 
by to stay fresh. 
</P>
<P>
But change or not, Hudson's market is chock-full of competitors anxious to curb 
its growth. They include Chili's, Fuddrucker's, Marie Callender's, Coco's and 
Red Robin, to name just a few rival mid-priced restaurant chains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Red Robin doesn't even keep close track of Hudson's Grill because 
"they're too small," said Madison Jobe, vice president of Irvine-based Red 
Robin, which has 61 outlets in 11 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the prospect of an economic recession, which could crimp ARC's 
growth plans if consumers eat at home more often to save money. Boppell isn't 
worried. "We're going to benefit from people coming down from the expensive" 
restaurants when they choose to dine out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's also likely that ARC will soon need a cash infusion to help pay for its 
growth plans, considering a typical Hudson's costs $400,000 to build and 
$275,000 to furnish. The company had $539,000 in cash reserves as of July 1, 
but Boppell conceded ARC "could use some more money." 
</P>
<P>
He's mulling whether to get another bank loan, sell additional shares of stock 
or otherwise raise funds. But Boppell probably will have to wait until he can 
show a longer string of profits before lenders or investors will provide more 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a crisis, so we're not out beating the bushes" for funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, those potentially negative factors have investors wary. Despite 
ARC's improvement, its stock is trading at $1.50 a share, the same price it 
fetched 18 months ago. Then again, only about 10% of ARC's stock is owned by 
the general public, so it's a thinly traded "pink sheet" issue. Boppell, 
Millender and other insiders own most of it. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether Hudson's Grills can keep generating steady profits. "By 
saying we flirt with the '50s, we think we can attract people that like that, 
but not be in that niche when it overheats," Boppell said. "The authentic '50s 
cafe, I think, may be doomed to what happened to the fern bars, that is, they 
get overbuilt and people get tired of them. We're going to move 15-20% a year 
in our concept." 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying the '50s flavor at a Hudson's Grill, however. The chain's 
name is a play on the front grille of the Hudson automobile, which was built 
from 1909 until 1957 when, after merging with Nash to form American Motors 
Corp., it was discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurants feature thick hamburgers and thicker milkshakes on the menu, a 
jukebox on the floor and other '50s paraphernalia on the walls including an 
actual Hudson car's front grille that appears to be smashing through the wall 
above -- what else -- the restaurant's cooking grill. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurants also feature chicken dishes, fajitas, appetizers and other 
'90s dishes. Waitresses don't wear poodle skirts, they wear polo shirts, and 
none are on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
This "moving concept" strategy was devised by Boppell, 48, a Santa Cruz native 
who before joining ARC had already retired because he received stock and other 
severance pay from PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell unit and Godfather's that "allowed 
me the financial flexibility not to have to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he left those companies mainly because he didn't enjoy being head of 
someone else's division. As a "retiree" between 1985 and 1988, he bought 
Ventura Toyota, a car dealership of which he still owns 51%, and dabbled in 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Millender and other ARC directors asked him to help divest the 
company's loss-ridden Wendy's outlets. He also arranged ARC's purchase of 
International Eateries Corp., which owned the Hudson's Grills, from Travis L. 
Bryant for $4.8 million and warrants that give him the right to purchase 1.7 
million shares, or about 24% of ARC, at a certain price within a specified 
period. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the purchase, Boppell came with it to head ARC. "I was antsy to get 
back into business," he said. He also got about 6% of ARC's stock, a holding he 
has since raised to about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
It's people in Boppell's age group, 35-55, who are making Hudson's market 
potentially lucrative, he said. Those people have by and large "moved past the 
fast-food experience" and want sit-down service, but "don't want to make a 
large commitment of time or funds," he said. The company's future will depend 
on how many move past Hudson's Grill on their way.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: INJUNCTION SETTLES SEC SUIT OVER LATE FILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel M. Barry, chairman of Agoura-based Electronic Clearing House Inc., agreed 
Aug. 21 to an injunction barring him from making late filings concerning stock 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission had charged that Barry violated 
securities laws by repeatedly being late in filing disclosures about his 
holdings of stock in the company, which provides check and credit card clearing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Barry did not admit or deny the charges in agreeing to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC suit also charged Anaheim-based Basics Financial Planning and 
Investments Inc. with making late filings concerning its holdings in Electronic 
Clearing House. Barry owns a 36% stake in Basics and is its president. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Barry and Basics filed about 30 various disclosures later 
than they were due. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction bars Barry and Basics from further violations like the ones 
alleged.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: UNIHEALTH MIGHT PURCHASE MORE PACIFICARE SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UniHealth America, a Burbank-based nonprofit concern that owns hospitals and 
other health care organizations, said it might purchase up to 500,000 
additional shares of PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a Cypress-based health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase would raise UniHealth's stake in PacifiCare from 58% to 62% of the 
total shares outstanding. However, that percentage could be affected by 
PacifiCare's announcement last week that it might repurchase up to 500,000 
shares of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth said the stock purchase would be coordinated with PacifiCare's, and 
would be made "when business conditions are favorable."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DATRON SYSTEMS ADOPTS ANTI-TAKEOVER RIGHTS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Datron Systems Inc., a Simi Valley producer of satellite-receiving dishes and 
other communications products, adopted a common anti-takeover tactic known as a 
shareholders' rights plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan's key feature says that if an unwelcome party acquires at least 20% of 
Datron's stock, the remaining shareholders have rights to buy additional Datron 
shares for half price. The idea is to increase the number of shares outstanding 
and make a hostile takeover of the company prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Datron said the rights would cover its shares outstanding on Sept. 5. The 
rights also can be redeemed by management in the event Datron's directors 
accept a merger offer.

A Horse Is a Horse: About 200 people milled around Sunday under a wild cherry 
tree in Tahlequah, Okla., where Mr. Ed, the 1960s television star, is said to 
be buried. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no record of his death because Mr. Ed was a horse, of course. A 
5-foot granite monument, with a picture of the "talking horse" sticking his 
head out over a barn door, was unveiled on the farm of Danny and Darlene 
Snodgrass. In another version of Mr. Ed's demise, a person associated with the 
show said the horse died in 1973 and was cremated, and his ashes strewn over 
Hollywood. BETH KLEID

In what was believed to be a record free-fall, crude oil prices plummeted 13% 
Monday as tensions eased in the Persian Gulf and prospects increased for a 
diplomatic resolution of the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for unleaded gasoline for later delivery fell 16.3%. The sharp decreases 
continued a sell-off that began Friday and ends for now the meteoric climb that 
brought prices to record levels last week on fears of war. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the price of crude oil for October delivery dived $4 to close at 
$26.91 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At one point, 
crude oil contracts traded as low as $4.86 a barrel below Friday's closing 
price. By comparison, crude oil futures traded as high as $32.25 a barrel last 
week, equal to the record high reached on Aug. 2, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mercantile exchange keeps no precise records on daily declines, a 
spokeswoman for the exchange said that "to the best of anyone's recollection . 
. . there hasn't been a drop this large since the contract started trading" on 
the exchange in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, September contracts for unleaded gasoline saw a record one-day drop, 
closing down 17.10 cents to 87.56 cents a gallon. Last week, gasoline closed as 
high as $1.0855 a gallon. Prices also fell on the spot market, where crude oil 
and oil products are traded for immediate delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"People obviously held back selling (on Friday), waiting to see if there was 
any confrontation" over the weekend, said Randall Rothenberg, a broker with 
Dean Witter International Energy Futures Group in New York. "Now that they've 
seen a lack of confrontation in the Gulf . . . people are taking it as a (sign) 
of some sort of resolution of this conflict." 
</P>
<P>
But few analysts believe gasoline pump prices will fall as quickly as they rose 
when prices for future contracts shot up immediately after the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think that oil companies intend to increase gas prices a few cents per 
gallon, claiming that we haven't passed the costs through yet, so it will be a 
while before consumers see decreases at the pump," said Edwin Rothschild, 
energy policy director for the consumer group Citizen Action in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the rapid declines to news that indicated a softening of 
Iraq's position: word that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar would 
meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and news that Iraq had ordered its 
tankers not to run a Western blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Fears had run high going into the weekend that the Persian Gulf standoff could 
erupt over Iraq's demand that foreign embassy staffs leave Kuwait. But no 
confrontation developed. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was also influenced by prospects that members of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to increase oil production quotas to 
offset production lost by the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil. After the 
close of trading, 10 of 11 OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna reportedly agreed 
to boost quotas, though further talks were scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Now, most traders doubt that prices will again reach $32 a barrel -- that is, 
unless a shooting war breaks out. "There's still a political standoff, and one 
incident could trade us right back up again," said Tom Bentz, director of 
trading at United Energy Inc. in New York. "It's still a touch-and-go 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, motorists fuming at the sharp run-up in pump prices should not 
expect any relief soon. On Monday, none of the major oil companies that sell 
gasoline in Los Angeles announced price cuts; some had increased wholesale 
dealer prices as late as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
When gasoline pump prices skyrocketed almost immediately after the invasion, 
oil company executives blamed the undue influence of spot and futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
"If a significant change in the gasoline futures market occurs, its effects 
will appear within a few days at gasoline stations all over the nation," the 
American Petroleum Institute said in a publication explaining the price 
run-ups. 
</P>
<P>
But that apparently holds only when prices go up. In July, when crude oil 
prices fell as much as 20% from January, gasoline pump prices remained firm and 
even increased in some cases. At the time, refiners and oil companies blamed 
high demand and tight refining capacity. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, oil companies are saying that they haven't yet recovered 
their increased costs from the hike in crude prices that resulted from the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The market hasn't equalized yet," said James Huccaby, manager of pricing and 
supply with Chevron U.S.A. in San Francisco. "Over time, however, if the market 
does decline . . . you can be assured we will be pricing our products 
competitively." 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said not to expect retail prices to fall for at least three or 
four weeks -- presuming oil prices remain stable, which is hardly likely. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts defended the industry. "Once you commit to a lower price, 
then you're stuck with that commitment for a period of time," said Scott Jones, 
president of AUS Consultants in West Conshohocken, Pa., and a former economist 
with Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
"If oil prices turn around and go back up for a few days, you're stuck with 
that decision," he said. "And the last thing you want to leave with consumers 
is prices that go up and down . . . price volatility is something the consumer 
doesn't want to see." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, said price analyst Trilby Lundberg: "The direct impact of the 
futures and spot gasoline market is less powerful at the tail end of the peak 
summer driving season (now) . . . than at its absolute height in July and 
August" because of falling demand. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, don't blame your local gasoline station. The retail dealer has not 
passed on all of the wholesale price increases he has had to pay since the 
invasion, said Lundberg, publisher of the widely read Lundberg Survey of 
national gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices rose an average of 9.43 cents a gallon nationally between Aug. 
10 and Aug. 24, according to the latest Lundberg Survey of 13,000 dealers. At 
the same time, the retail price increased only 5.2 cents a gallon to $1.3316, 
the survey reported.

36 OF IRAQ'S 55 EMBASSY STAFFERS EXPELLED BY U.S. 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration on Monday expelled two-thirds of the Iraqi diplomatic 
staff in Washington and encouraged 34 other nations with embassies in Kuwait to 
take similar steps against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait and Iraq, meanwhile, Iraqi military authorities intensified efforts 
to round up foreigners. State Department officials said that over the weekend, 
seven more private American citizens were taken into Iraqi custody. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city is now operating only with its own water and 
food supplies, which State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said are 
sufficient for U.S. diplomats to hold out "at least several days" against the 
siege by Iraqi troops. The embassy has been operating with its own electricity 
generator since troops cut off its supplies, water and power from outside. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush told a news conference in Maine that the United States is 
requiring Iraqi diplomats to leave the country by Thursday, and he contrasted 
that order with Iraq's policy of preventing American diplomats from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will be held against their will," Bush said of the Iraqi diplomats. 
"They're all free to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department spokeswoman said the expulsions were in response to Iraq's 
recent violations of international law, including its efforts to annex Kuwait 
and, "in particular, the illegal order to close our embassy in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Iraq has been allowed to maintain 55 of its nationals -- including 
both diplomats and non-diplomatic staff members -- at its embassy in 
Washington. The order Monday requires Iraq to cut its embassy back to 19 
people. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials acknowledged they chose the figure of 19 because it matches the 
total number of American diplomats still working in Iraq and Kuwait. About 55 
other American diplomats who had been working out of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait 
left that nation with the intention of leaving the region but were barred by 
Iraqi officials from leaving Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials hinted broadly that if more American diplomats are forced out of 
the U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Iraq, more Iraqis will be expelled from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The President told reporters that the United States is "trying to keep a 
reasonable parallel in terms of numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to Washington, told reporters that the 
U.S. decision to expel most of his staff was "uncalled for, unfair and unjust. 
We feel we have been victimized once more." Mashat said the U.S. action will 
reduce the effectiveness of Iraqi diplomats in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. order requires seven diplomats and 29 non-diplomatic staff members at 
Iraq's embassy to pack up and leave the United States within 72 hours -- or by 
4:30 p.m. Thursday. Included in the order is the embassy's entire commercial 
section, which is responsible for promoting Iraq's trade with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel there's much need for the Iraqis to be here trying to buy at 
this particular time," Tutwiler told a State Department briefing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Department imposed a series of new restrictions on the 
remaining Iraqi personnel at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
They will be prohibited from traveling more than 25 miles from Washington, and 
they and their families will be given only single-entry visas to the United 
States instead of the customary multiple-entry visas that allow them to enter 
and leave the country virtually at will. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tutwiler said, use of Iraqi Embassy funds for Iraqi students and 
for other humanitarian needs will be "closely controlled." She did not explain 
what this last restriction will mean. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions do not apply to Iraq's United Nations mission in New York, 
which will be allowed to continue operating at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Mack called in 
representatives of the 34 countries to tell them about the new U.S. move 
against Iraqi diplomats. Those nations have refused to close their embassies in 
Kuwait despite threats from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is urging other governments, particularly those whose 
embassies have been affected by Iraqi actions in Kuwait, to consider taking 
similar actions against Iraq's official and non-official presence in their 
countries," Tutwiler explained. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger summoned Mashat, the Iraqi 
ambassador, to the State Department at 9 a.m. Monday to inform him of the 
expulsion order. Mashat himself was not covered by the order and will be 
permitted to remain here. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised when I was informed of this action," Mashat said later. " . . 
. We will try to be cooperative with the United States, because we have nothing 
against the American people." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said Monday that over the weekend, two private 
Americans in Kuwait were taken from their apartments by Iraqi soldiers. "Once 
again, the Iraqis knocked on the door, and when the two answered they were 
taken to the Regency Hotel in Kuwait city," said Tutwiler. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Americans also were picked up in Kuwait on Saturday and brought to 
the same hotel, where they and the others were held by Iraqi authorities. State 
Department officials said they did not know how the four had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one private American in Iraq was taken away from his place of 
work. U.S. officials did not know where this American was taken. 
</P>
<P>
In all, State Department officials say, Iraqi authorities have rounded up 42 
Americans inside Iraq and another 21 in Kuwait. They are the only Americans 
under direct Iraqi detention or control, out of the total of about 3,000 
Americans who were barred from leaving Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"In Kuwait, food availability appears adequate, although stocks of some items, 
especially fruits and vegetables, are not plentiful," Tutwiler said Monday. "In 
Iraq, we know that internal food prices are going through the roof for certain 
commodities like rice and sugar, and we know that there are bread lines in 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

NATURE MAY SUFFER MOST IN STATE'S LONG DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE FOUR-YEAR DRY SPELL HAS EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON FORESTS, 
RIVERS AND WILDLIFE.

<TEXT>
<P>
California's drought has taken a massive environmental toll in dead trees and 
wildfires, in devastated salmon and striped bass runs, and in deer lost to a 
bacterial disease that thrives in shrinking watering holes, state officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While cities have gotten by through conservation efforts and farmers are making 
do by pumping ground water, officials have been surprised by the drought's toll 
in forests and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just beginning to see the most dramatic impacts of the drought," said 
Dick Daniel, assistant chief of the state Department of Fish and Game's 
environmental services division. 
</P>
<P>
The damage to fisheries is a result of the reduction of flow from mountain 
reservoirs into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the huge estuary where 
the state and U.S. governments divvy up water for their aqueducts. The delta is 
inland from San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
When too little water is released from the dams, the river water becomes too 
warm for salmon to spawn. Under a special arrangement, cold deep water will be 
released from Shasta Dam in an effort to save 484 salmon known to have survived 
the winter run up the Sacramento River -- the last of what once was a historic 
spawning run. But there is no cold water available for other rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"On the American River this year we are expecting near-total loss of the 
fall-run Chinook salmon," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
When the water temperature reached an extreme high of 78 degrees in a hatchery 
on the American River last week, more than 3,000 pounds of trout were lost and 
a like amount released into the river in an effort to save them, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt will be made to rescue some fish from the American, San Joaquin and 
Stanislaus rivers later this summer. If they survive the tricky procedure of 
being trapped, transported to a hatchery and artificially spawned, their eggs 
will be replanted in the river when the water temperature drops in fall. 
</P>
<P>
Striped bass, popular game fish that breed in the delta, are more plentiful 
than salmon, but officials are alarmed because the stripers are being found in 
their lowest numbers ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the striped bass will recover," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Deer are dying from the spread of blue tongue disease, which is caused by 
bacteria that build up in shrinking watering holes. Exact numbers for the deer 
loss are not known, he said, but hunters are finding carcasses and a scarcity 
of deer in the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Deer also have suffered from a loss of acorns, a favorite food. The poor health 
of does has led to fewer fawns surviving this year, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcity of food in the wilds also has brought a rash of mountain lion reports 
in settled areas -- a lion believed to have traveled from Fresno County was 
trapped in a yard last week in Rancho Cordova, a Sacramento suburb -- and led 
to dozens of clashes between bears and humans. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of incidents with bears has gone way up," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Drought is nothing new to California wildlife, officials stress. If a species 
evolved here, it did so through periodic cycles of dry weather -- the last 
comparable one lasting six years from 1929 to 1934. But this drought is 
different because the state now has about 29 million residents who have a claim 
on the available water. Many also live in suburbs and towns built on what were 
recently wildlands where deer and mountain lions ranged, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
With more people living in the hills, the fire danger to homes has also 
increased since previous droughts. 
</P>
<P>
The fire toll for the year stands at 304,900 acres burned and 873 structures 
destroyed. Three firefighters have died. It has been the state's worst fire 
year since 1987 -- the worst in history -- when 11 firefighters were killed and 
740,000 acres scorched. 
</P>
<P>
Foresters estimate that the trees -- mostly firs and pines -- killed by the 
bark beetles that thrive in drought hold the equivalent of 12 billion board 
feet of lumber. That is more wood than California normally uses for 
construction in a year, said Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of trees are affected. Brown trees are especially visible at lower 
elevations in the southern half of the Sierra Nevada, where the climate has 
been driest, and in the Tahoe National Forest. "It's almost 50-50 (between live 
and dead trees) in parts of that forest," Terrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical storms in May and June removed 1990 from the list of epic dry years. 
Nonetheless, this will be the 12th-driest year this century for California's 
milestone water basin -- the Sacramento River Basin -- and an even more 
historic dry period in areas such as Santa Barbara, where one of two municipal 
reservoirs has gone dry. 
</P>
<P>
Even as state officials were tallying the ravages of the four-year drought, 
they also were turning to historical records to predict that the dry spell will 
probably not continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The historical odds are 9 in 10 that there will be more runoff next year," 
said Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist for the state Department of Water 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually the same odds were held for last winter when, nonetheless, the 
state's rain and snowfall were below normal for the fourth year, the longest 
dry stretch since the 1930s.

CENSUS PUTS STATE NEAR 30 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES and FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With mushrooming growth in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Valley and 
major cities, California gained 5.6 million residents in the last decade and 
reinforced its standing as the country's most populous, ethnically diverse and 
politically powerful state, according to preliminary U.S. Census figures 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
California grew by 24%, bringing its total population to just under 30 million 
people, the census figures showed. Officials said the figures are subject to 
adjustment and will not become final until early 1991, but California's 
population gain is expected to be the largest among the states. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the growth, California stands to gain seven congressional seats, 
which would make it the first to have more than 50 elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 congressional elections, California will probably choose 12% of the 
435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. That would be the largest 
percentage chosen by any state since 1860, when New York elected 13% of the 
House. California's increased influence in Congress would also be felt in the 
presidential elections. The state would cast 54 electoral votes, more than 
one-fifth of the 270 needed to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
While the population explosion could benefit the state through increased 
federal funding and political power, experts said it also will aggravate a 
number of the state's problems, including overcrowded schools, an inadequate 
transportation network and deteriorating air and water quality.

"California is changing more than any society in this nation," said Alan 
Heslop, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College and an authority on 
population trends. 
</P>
<P>
About one in nine U.S. residents now live in California, giving the state more 
people than Canada or Australia and all but 28 of the world's countries. In the 
last decade alone, one-fourth of the U.S. population growth has occurred in 
California, according to a study released earlier this year by the Palo 
Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the state's growth in the 1980s was the result of immigration 
from foreign countries and other states, and about half was because births in 
the state exceeded deaths, the study said. The state's combined population of 
Latinos, Asians and African-Americans is expected to make up 40% of its 
population in the final 1990 census and nearly 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary census does not break down the population by ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among the state's growth leaders is Riverside County, which grew 72% in the 
decade, with its population jumping from 663,000 to 1.1 million. Riverside 
County and San Bernardino County, which grew by 56%, made the Inland Empire the 
fastest-growing major metropolitan area in the nation, according to census 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County officials have long anticipated that about 1.4 million 
residents would be counted in the 1990 census, Assistant County Administrator 
Lynn Kirkhofer said. "There are a whole slug of state and federal programs that 
are census-based, from job-training to special welfare programs to economic 
development money to road money. That's why this validation is so very 
important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Supervisor Norton Younglove said: "Quite frankly, it's an 
honor I'd just as soon have done without. (Growth) has come too fast." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the state's most spectacular growth also occurred in the Sierra Nevada 
foothills. Placer County grew fastest, with an increase of about 54,000 people 
or 46%. To the south, Tuolumne County grew by just over 14,000 people, or 42%. 
In Central California, Stanislaus County grew by about 101,000 people, or 38%. 
</P>
<P>
This growth is causing changes that are not always welcome, as evident in 
Tuolumne County, where a boom in new construction is accompanied by traffic 
jams. "We have a lot of people coming in from urban areas," said Bev Shane, the 
county's assistant director of planning. "They love open spaces but they also 
want shopping centers and other types of growth." 
</P>
<P>
By sheer numbers of people, Los Angeles County experienced the greatest influx, 
with an increase of 1,242,000 people, or 17%. San Diego County was second, 
growing by 604,000 people. Among the slowest-growing areas in the state are San 
Francisco, with a 5% growth rate, and Marin County, with 2%. One Marin city, 
Sausalito, actually lost 7% of its 1980 population, declining from 7,338 to 
6,857, although Mayor Annette Rose said the drop was probably due to 
miscounting the several hundred residents living on houseboats or in obscure 
rural areas. She said census takers made a similar error in 1980 and the city's 
population had to be revised later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County grew by 33%, Sacramento County by 31%, Fresno County by 28%, 
Orange County by 24%, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties by 23% and Contra 
Costa County by 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fastest-growing cities in the state was Palmdale, where a 330% growth 
rate took the city from a paltry 15,197 to 65,357, making it one of many desert 
communities north and east of Los Angeles that are attracting former city 
dwellers in search of affordable housing. Fresno was second among larger 
cities, with a population increase of 61%, followed by Stockton with 36%, 
Sacramento 32%, San Jose with 22%, Los Angeles with 15% and Oakland with 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The census count in 41 of the 46 states that received their preliminary figures 
has been about 1.6% below the Census Bureau's own projections, with California 
a notable exception, said Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a 
political consulting firm that specializes in the census. California's figure 
is estimated to be one-tenth of 1% below the census projections, Brace said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz said she believes that 
minorities and the homeless are still being undercounted in Los Angeles. For 
example, she said, 70,000 census mailings initially went undelivered in 
South-Central Los Angeles alone, while 31% of the area's census data was 
gathered second-hand from neighbors rather than directly from residents. 
"That's darn bad," she said.

SEN. KEENE SUPPORTS CARPENTER'S 'REVERSE STING' CLAIM; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: MAJORITY LEADER TELLS JURY OF A 1986 CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE FORMER 
LEGISLATOR SAID HE WOULD 'HAVE SOME FUN' WITH UNDERCOVER AGENT'S OFFER OF 
$20,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter confided four years ago that he believed he 
was the target of a sting investigation and said he was "going to have some fun 
with it," Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Keene (D-Benicia) told a federal court jury that he dismissed Carpenter's 
statement because the senator had many "idiosyncrasies" and was known to do "a 
certain amount of fantasizing." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter is on trial on four charges of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy 
as a result of a long-running FBI sting investigation into corruption in the 
state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Central to his defense is the contention that he knew all along he was the 
target of a sting, knowingly took $20,000 from an undercover FBI agent and then 
laughed at him. In recent months, Carpenter has maintained that he was 
conducting his own "reverse sting" of federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the case against Carpenter revolves around a 1986 bill planted in the 
Legislature by the FBI that would have given a $1-million tax break to a dummy 
Alabama shrimp-importing firm seeking to open a processing plant near 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Keene was among 10 witnesses called as the defense began presenting its case. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his conversation with Carpenter, Keene said, the Legislature was 
rife with rumors of a possible undercover investigation because of earlier 
charges of corruption involving state legislators. Senators would joke among 
themselves, he said, patting each other down in a supposed search for hidden 
tape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Keene said Carpenter's comment about a possible sting came just before a vote 
was scheduled in a Senate committee on the shrimp bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a bit too lighthearted to be taken seriously," Keene told the 
federal court jury. "I didn't pay any attention to it. It didn't direct my 
action at all." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gerard Hinckley suggested that his client was a "Walter Mitty" 
sort who sometimes imagined himself to be something other than what he was. 
</P>
<P>
Keene agreed, saying, "Paul had very many creative ideas that were good ideas 
and many creative ideas that didn't stand up well." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Nuechterlein, Keene 
testified that Carpenter said nothing about calling authorities about the 
$20,000 payment offered to him in connection with the shrimp bill. Instead, 
Keene said, "He told me he was going to have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
According to evidence presented by federal prosecutors, Carpenter accepted the 
money and promised in several tape-recorded conversations to take action to 
help the shrimp bill win passage in the Senate. He did not vote for the measure 
when it was on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Also called to testify were Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) and Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), who said they could not recall 
Carpenter ever approaching them for help in winning approval of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
In one taped conversation, Carpenter told undercover agent John E. Brennan that 
he had pushed Greene to take the measure off the inactive file in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene told the jury, "I don't recall any conversation with Sen. Carpenter 
at any time regarding that bill." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Carpenter aide John Shahabian said at one point that Carpenter would 
go to Roberti to arrange to have the bill heard in a more favorable committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I have such an absence of recollection on that bill, I feel pretty confident 
that Sen. Carpenter never talked to me about that bill," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to shake the testimony of Shahabian -- who is now cooperating 
with the government -- the defense called Doris Morrow, a former aide to the 
senator who testified she has lived with Carpenter since before the 
investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
She told the jury that she overheard a key meeting in Carpenter's office in 
which Shahabian told the senator about the $20,000 contribution and requested a 
cut for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow testified that Carpenter suggested it could be a setup but Shahabian 
insisted it was legitimate. Her statements contradicted Shahabian, who said 
that Carpenter never raised the question of a sting. Shahabian had testified 
that he did not recall Morrow being present when he met with Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution sought to undermine Morrow's testimony by pointing out her 
close ties with Carpenter, noting that she began dating the senator nearly a 
decade ago, before he hired her and at a time when he was married.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO TRY CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS

<P>
In an innovative program designed to save money and increase the self-esteem of 
food stamp recipients, San Diego County will begin paying cash instead of 
coupons on Sept. 1, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Called a "full cash-out implementation," the unique program is being hailed by 
county, state and federal officials as a model for national welfare reform, 
said county officials familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams and other officials said that 
giving food stamp clients cash instead of coupons will reduce program costs 
while increasing the recipients' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics within the county Social Services Department have warned, however, 
that giving food stamp recipients cash instead of coupons might lead to more 
abuse and ultimately increase the cost of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, food stamp coupons can be used only to purchase food and cannot be 
used to buy liquor, cigarettes or other non-food items. A cash-only program 
will carry with it none of those restrictions, making it impossible to monitor 
how the money is being used, said one social services employee, who did not 
want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
County officials countered that they expect no more fraud than under the 
current food stamp program, which has spawned a black market in which the 
coupons trade for less than their face value. Under the new system, recipients 
will need proper identification to cash the county-issued checks. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Social Services Department, an estimated 46,000 households and 
139,000 people receive food stamp assistance in San Diego County. The county, 
the fifth largest in population in the United States, proposed the ambitious 
plan to state and federal officials last year and initiated a pilot program 
involving 20% of the county's food stamp clients in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The county has received federal approval to expand the program to include all 
food stamp households. 
</P>
<P>
An official announcement is expected today by federal, state and county county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
County officials familiar with the plan say it will save $600,000 in 
administrative costs at the state, county and federal levels between September, 
1990, and July, 1991. The cost of the food stamp program in the county, 
currently about $67 million, is funded entirely by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
By mailing food stamp clients a monthly check instead of coupons, the county 
saves thousands of dollars in postage fees for the 590,000 food stamp packets 
it mails. In addition, the county will be able to close its food stamp issuance 
center and will no longer have to pay an armored transport company to handle 
the coupons. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot program was such an overwhelming success last year. We projected a 
savings of $86,000 but saved $150,000 instead," said a county official who 
asked not to be named before today's planned announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams and other officials said that 
besides reducing costs, giving food stamp clients cash instead will increase 
the recipients' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Food stamps put a person at a disadvantage. It's a put-down and a humiliating 
thing to have food stamps in a grocery line," Williams said in a telephone 
interview. " . . . You have to take away factors that diminish a person. You 
have to give a person back his or her dignity."

FEINSTEIN'S HUSBAND LISTS CLIENTS, THREATENS TO SUE WILSON OVER 'LIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investment banker Richard C. Blum, the husband of Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Dianne Feinstein, released a full list of his business clients on 
Monday and publicly threatened to sue Pete Wilson if the Republican continues 
his barrage of criticism against him. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the list -- which had been sought during the Democratic primary 
by Feinstein competitor John K. Van de Kamp and in recent weeks by Wilson -- 
yielded the names of 56 individuals and trusts, including some extremely 
wealthy clients such as investor Robert M. Bass and composer Gordon Getty, son 
of the late financier J. Paul Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Also included were individuals who represent a cross-section of American 
finance: Robert S. Salomon Jr. of New York firm Salomon Bros., venture 
capitalist Arthur Rock of San Francisco and investment banker F. Warren Hellman 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, who earlier in the campaign had adamantly refused to name individual 
clients, said he hoped that his change of heart would "dispel any notion that 
there are any hidden agendas here." 
</P>
<P>
The banker also said his attorney has sent Wilson, vying for the governorship 
against Feinstein, a "cease and desist" letter requesting an end to the 
questions Wilson's campaign has raised about Blum. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's going to say anything about me -- and if I'm fair game, so be it -- do 
it with some degree of integrity," Blum told reporters at a Los Angeles press 
conference, where he repeated remarks made earlier in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been put on notice that what he's doing is injurious to our business. . . 
. I don't think we're fair game when someone maliciously lies about our 
activities and he has done that rather consistently," Blum added. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Wilson's campaign director, Otto Bos, said Wilson had made every 
effort to be truthful in characterizing Blum's financial dealings. "We believe 
the campaign should be fought on the stump, not in the courts," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, who has been married to Feinstein for a decade, released his records in 
the face of Wilson advertisements that said the couple "own" an Oregon savings 
and loan. The Wilson commercial itself was a response to a Feinstein ad that 
suggested Wilson had voted for the thrift industry as a U.S. senator because he 
had received more than $243,000 in campaign contributions from industry 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates have been battling to see who can muddy up the other in the 
minds of voters, who they believe are highly concerned about government ethics 
and the spiraling savings-and-loan bailout now facing the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Times Poll released Saturday, Feinstein and Wilson are running 
dead even just days before the campaign's traditional Labor Day kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's release of Blum's individual clients complements his disclosures 
nearly six months ago of his corporate clients, which include Bankamerica 
Corp., Executive Life Insurance Co., Northwest Airlines, Sumitomo Bank of 
California and others. Overall, Blum said he controls about $400 million in 
marketable and private securities. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to reporters, Blum echoed previous comments by Feinstein that the 
couple keep their finances separate. He said his firm, Richard C. Blum &amp; 
Associates, through which he makes investments, was founded before their 
marriage and is not community property. According to state law, however, all 
income gained from the investments is community property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Feinstein does not have a share in the firm, she does not have any 
personal holdings in Jackson County Savings &amp; Loan, which the Wilson 
commercial says the couple own, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Blum said that he does not "own" the institution either. He said his 
firm owns 24.9% of the Oregon firm, a percentage deliberately chosen because it 
is just under the 25% mark that would constitute a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's campaign countered that other Blum clients have holdings in the 
savings and loan that -- combined with Blum's -- constitute ownership. But Blum 
said he neither controls those investments nor votes their shares. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he said, he personally owns one quarter of 1% of the thrift, which he 
said has yet to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
That holding is his only current investment in a savings and loan, Blum said. 
He previously bought, and has since sold, shares in a second thrift, and a 
trust set up for his adult children owns shares in American Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Besides hitting Blum on the Oregon holdings, the Wilson camp has criticized him 
for an investment he has in National Education Corp., whose subsidiary does 
business with South Africa. As the Wilson camp has pointed out, that runs 
counter to Blum's statements that he will not do business with any firm that 
has South African connections. 
</P>
<P>
Blum described the subsidiary's connection as short-term. He said he learned of 
the corporation's South African dealings when it attempted to merge two years 
ago with a company in which he had an interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it very clear that we had no interest in pursuing the merger if they 
were going to continue to do business with South Africa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
National Educational Corp. sold off one South African subsidiary upon his 
request, Blum said. Another subsidiary has a licensing agreement with South 
Africa that it cannot legally abridge, he said, adding that the firm will not 
renew the contract. 
</P>
<P>
If his wife is elected, Blum said, he will forward listings of his holdings to 
the attorney general for a legal opinion as to whether they would constitute a 
conflict of interest with Feinstein's duties. To his knowledge, he said, only 
one of the firms in which he has invested now does business with the state. 
</P>
<P>
Blum and Feinstein supplemented her fund raising with about $3 million of their 
own money during the primary, but he expressed hopes Monday that they could in 
the future depend on outside sources for backing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fund-raising efforts today are very encouraging . . . and hopefully that 
will suffice," he said with a wry smile.

NAVY WIVES ON THE FRONT LINES AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference room at the Long Beach Naval Station was sweltering, so hot that 
the Navy wives wondered for a moment what it must be like in the Persian Gulf. 
"If they can stand the heat," Pat Keys said dryly, "then so can we." 
</P>
<P>
Keys and two dozen other wives were assembled at the Long Beach base one night 
last week because they are at the front lines of a struggle being waged far 
from the Middle East. It is a battle for calm. A quest for answers. A fight to 
keep their lives, and the lives of other Navy families, as normal as possible 
amid the turmoil of the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The 80 women of the Long Beach Naval Station's Ombudsmen's Council are the 
primary link between local families and the 1,800 sailors in or around the gulf 
in four warships: the Antietam, the Prairie, the Vandegrift and the Daniel R. 
Ray. The women are also the communication and support network for hundreds of 
other Navy personnel and local reserves who may be dispatched to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Like ombudsmen councils at Navy bases nationwide, the Long Beach 
troubleshooters have been around for decades. But not since the Vietnam War 
have the councils faced the sort of challenge and stress now present with U.S. 
warships massing in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks, these Navy wives, many of them with husbands already deployed, 
have been serving as surrogate family to other Navy wives. They have been 
taking calls at home from spouses and then placing calls to the naval command. 
They have been holding public meetings on some days and trying in private on 
others to resolve family problems without alarming a military spouse. In short, 
they have been trying every way they can to fill the gaps left when a military 
family is temporarily split up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't chauffeur. I don't baby-sit. And I'm not a bank. But I'll help out, 
like the others, just about any other way I can," said Debbie Stiles-Lusk, an 
ombudsman for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, that means taking calls from a distraught spouse, like the young 
Navy wife who has been calling Stiles-Lusk since the crisis began. Six months 
pregnant, her husband sent to the gulf, the young woman is scared and lonely 
enough to make Stiles-Lusk forget, for a time, that her own husband, Paul, is 
also there aboard a ship. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to put aside your own feelings sometimes. You have to have some heart 
in dealing with other people," said Stiles-Lusk, 37, of San Pedro. "If they 
need an ear, they need an ear." 
</P>
<P>
Other times, the ombudsmen's council coordinates visits to Navy wives whose 
husbands, even under normal deployments, are gone six months a year. The visits 
help bring the Navy wives out of their shells and often out of their homes, 
where some hide themselves for days at a time. That has been particularly true 
recently as families sit glued to their television sets for some word, any 
word, on their spouse's ship or the next deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"I know wives who are watching television 10 to 14 hours a day. Sleeping on 
their couch and then waking up in the middle of the night to turn on the set 
and see if anything's happened," said Stiles-Lusk. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of existence, she and other ombudsmen said, is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Concern is one thing. But allowing fears to paralyze is destructive," she 
said. "So I tell the wives it's important to evaluate what they're doing to 
themselves when they watch that much television," said Stiles-Lusk, who has 
limited her own television watching to three hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the ombudsmen say, they have learned through experience how to 
help others through the loneliness and fears and struggle of life as a Navy 
spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when you're having a real lousy day, getting yourself out of that 
feeling to help another wife is one of the hardest things we need to do," said 
ombudsman Sharon Hamilton, 41, of Long Beach. "But we do it." 
</P>
<P>
As Keys, president of the council, explained: "Don't get the impression that 
we're not human because we act stronger. We have the same emotions as anyone 
else. But I think the majority of us are strong, independent people and you 
have to be independent when you spend half of your life alone." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even Keys and the others have never been through the sort of anxiety now 
arising from the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way, everybody is spending more time in church," Keys said. 
</P>
<P>
They also are spending more time together, such as at the meeting last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There, they talked over strategies that might help families. The advice ranged 
from dealing with children to protecting themselves from taking on the anxiety 
of other wives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to remember," Keys later told the group, "that you as ombudsmen 
are taking a big part of the stress. So take care of yourself first." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the advice is often hard to follow, especially when the wives are 
fielding calls all day and night from other Navy spouses who want information 
on military actions or deployments. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be frustrating," Keys said, "because you do feel for the people who 
call. Sometimes, it seems like we should have the answers and we don't. And 
it's hard to say 'I don't know.' " 
</P>
<P>
Often, that is all Keys and the others can say, either because they have not 
been given the information or are not at liberty to talk. 
</P>
<P>
They may not like the restrictions, but the ombudsmen abide by them just as 
they hold to the belief that Navy wives will get through the gulf crisis by 
doing what they have done during other deployments. They will talk. They will 
meet. They will live life as normally as they can.

SHOOTING

<P>
One man was killed and two youths were wounded early Monday as they left a 
South Los Angeles home in what police believe was a gang-related shooting, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said all three victims -- who are believed to be gang members -- were 
leaving a house in the 8700 block of Fir Avenue at 4:30 a.m. when a rival gang 
member opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old was shot twice in the chest and died at the scene. His name had 
not been released late Monday, pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The other two victims, both juveniles, were also shot in the chest. They were 
taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where one was in critical 
condition and the other in stable condition Monday afternoon.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN 'COTTON CLUB' 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection began Monday in the trial of four people accused of killing 
producer Roy Radin in a dispute over financing for the movie "The Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
Karen De Layne Greenberger, 43, is accused of hiring William Mentzer, 40; 
Robert Ulmer Lowe, 43; and Alex Marti, 30, to kill Radin, a New York theatrical 
producer, in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last four to nine months. Jury selection before Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Curtis Rappe is expected to take several days. 
Each defendant has pleaded not guilty. The four are being held without bail and 
could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities charge that, in exchange for introducing Radin to Hollywood 
producer Robert Evans, Greenberger, a reputed cocaine dealer, demanded 50% of 
the profits from the production company that the two men intended to form to 
finance the movie. But Radin only offered Greenberger a 5% finder's fee and 
that led to his slaying, authorities said.

<P>
A Times poll of Southern California drivers last year found that 38% had made 
indecent gestures toward other motorists, 11% had become embroiled in a dispute 
(1% physical) on the roadway in the previous 12 months, and 5% admitted 
carrying a gun in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacred Heart Auto League recommends a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Drive with peace -- use your driving time to show Christ's love," says one of 
a series of TV ads that the group has begun running on Southern California 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers who phone an 800 number receive information about the league -- a 
Catholic organization run by the Sacred Heart Priests order of Walls, Miss. -- 
as well as a statuette of Jesus to place on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mark Ratay said that one reason that L.A. was chosen for a test run 
of the TV ads was that "in Southern California, you have a lot of bad traffic 
situations. If you are cut off, you can either shake your fist and swear at the 
person or take the Christian attitude and make up for the rudeness of others by 
not being rude back." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, remember that Someone Up There is watching -- and we don't 
meant the CHP officer on the freeway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Fluent of Glendale figures that "there's never a line of people waiting 
to brush their teeth" at the house featured in the accompanying ad, which he 
found in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Only the other day, we identified the source of the New Freeway Chickens on the 
Hollywood Freeway -- a nearby resident whose birds fled when he acquired a pit 
bull. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a shocking disclosure about the Old Freeway Chickens, believed to be 
the purported survivors of a 1969 poultry truck crash. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and her twin sister kept the secret to themselves for years," said 
Jeff Stein of Granada Hills. "Then, one day, someone mentioned the poultry 
truck story at her sister's house and my wife said, 'That's not how the 
chickens got there. We put them there."' 
</P>
<P>
Janet Stein related how in 1968, when the girls were 12, they learned that a 
nearby school that raised animals was closing and that its resident chickens 
would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
The twins scooped them up and succeeded in hiding them at home until a rooster 
awoke everyone at 5 a.m. The chickens couldn't stay. 
</P>
<P>
"So there were these two little girls," said Jeff Stein, "hiking through a 
field to an open area near the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
How many chickens did they dump? 
</P>
<P>
"How many can you fit into two pillowcases?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody out there loves L.A. We may take our knocks from Seattle, San 
Francisco and, well, you know the list. But not from Kecskemet, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Barnabas Paroczai , a 17-year-old Kecskemet student, wrote to Air L.A., a local 
commuter airline, for "pictures and photos and all kind of colour print of 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
In slightly uncertain English, he explained that he was "a fan for the U.S.A." 
and that "I like, I very-very like Los Angeles . . . I want to know all about 
that beautiful town." 
</P>
<P>
This week's Dueling Sign Winner (see photo), on Lankershim Boulevard near the 
Hollywood Freeway, seems to indicate that all roads lead south. 
</P>
<P>
Grandchildren were popping up all over the place for Joe and Loretta Ross the 
other day. Four hours after their daughter, Victoria Schloss, had triplets in 
Van Nuys, their son's wife, Debbie Ross, gave birth to a boy in Santa Monica. 
It was also Debbie's birthday. "We'll have to rent a hall for the birthdays 
next year," said Grandpa.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 COLOMBIANS CHARGED IN SEIZURE OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Colombians were charged Monday with conspiracy and narcotics possession 
in the seizure of more than 600 pounds of cocaine valued at $106 million found 
buried beneath laundry soap in barrels being unloaded from a truck, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Ospina, 27; Diego Ocampo Lopez, 33, and Horacio Aceves, 35, were charged 
by the district attorney's office with one count each of conspiracy, possession 
of cocaine for sale and transportation of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they would seek bail of $5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were arrested Aug. 23 after Los Angeles and South Gate police, 
who had two of the suspects under surveillance, watched them meet the third 
defendant at an apartment on Alvarado Street, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lonnie Felker 
said. The defendants got into a truck and tried to outrun the police, then 
began unloading drums outside an auto repair shop on Alvarado, Felker said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, suspecting that the drums contained drugs, brought in drug-sniffing 
dogs.

MURALIST ASKS CITY TO PAY FOR WHITEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before they disappeared, they were four of the most engaging faces in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There was the middle-aged man in glasses -- solid, direct, slightly 
authoritarian as he looked you right in the eye. Opposite was his wife -- 
eyebrows arched over a gentle, worried smile. 
</P>
<P>
There was a younger man, dark and intense, staring across the street -- 
directly into the pretty, passive face of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, they brightened the gloomy Sunset Boulevard underpass in Echo 
Park with such a glow of personality that they landed on the cover of the book 
"L.A. Wall Art." 
</P>
<P>
The faces disappeared earlier this year when a contractor visited the underpass 
as part of an assignment to eradicate graffiti on city property. When the job 
was done, white paint covered the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The former gang member who painted the faces is locked in a tug of war with the 
city over who should be responsible when the government destroys a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, 29-year-old electrician Ruben Brucelyn, is not seeking compensation 
for loss of the mural -- merely to be reimbursed for his costs so he can 
repaint the work, which he created with private donations under the guidance of 
Los Angeles muralist Kent Twitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Brucelyn has presented the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance an invoice for 
$2,500 to cover paint and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding that it was probably a mistake to paint over the mural, city 
officials have so far ignored the request. The burden falls on muralists to 
remove graffiti from their works if they don't want the city involved, 
according to Curtis Bianchi, general superintendent in the Bureau of Street 
Maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti "must be taken care of very quickly or it's just like an explosion 
happens," Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the crew that painted over Brucelyn's mural was acting under a policy 
calling for the removal of graffiti from city property within 48 hours. The 
city retains a private contractor, Graffiti Prevention Systems, to patrol 
public structures. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute dates to Jan. 8, when a crew was sent to the Sunset bridge, which 
crosses heavily traveled Glendale Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that there are what I would consider to be unauthorized murals 
throughout the city," Bianchi said. "Many have been painted over." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Brucelyn's 1985 work was not unauthorized. He had received 
approval of the design from the city's Cultural Affairs Department and had 
personally kept it free of graffiti for three years. He said he had applied a 
protective coating and only needed to rub the graffiti off with solvent and 
touch up the paint underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Brucelyn said he arrived on the scene just as workers were burying the faces 
under swaths of white paint. He protested, but they continued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crushed, devastated," the artist said in a letter of complaint to 
Bianchi. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he asked for funds to repaint the faces. If necessary, he will file 
a formal claim against the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mural had more significance to Brucelyn and Echo Park than the commuter 
passing through the tunnel could have guessed. The faces were based on real 
people -- the younger man being Brucelyn himself. The others are those who 
helped him escape gang life. 
</P>
<P>
The older man in the mural was based on Harold Helms, pastor of Angelus Temple, 
the white domed church beside Echo Park Lake. He runs a Spanish-language 
ministry and outreach programs for gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to be a real bona fide tough gang kid," muralist Twitchell said of 
Brucelyn. "He met his wife who was a Christian, a smart, savvy young woman. He 
began going to church with her. It changed his life into a positive life." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell also had a role in the turnaround. The two met in 1984, when Brucelyn 
stopped on the Harbor Freeway to watch Twitchell work on the faces he was 
commissioned to paint on freeway walls for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell created the stencil-like forms for the young electrician's first 
murals, the Olympic runners on the stairway west of Echo Park Lake.

Brucelyn took a detour from his art projects in 1988 to write and produce a 
play, "Smile Now, Cry Later," depicting the ravages of the gang culture. Last 
year, he rebuilt his house in Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
With all that going on, he admitted, he neglected the faces mural during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, Brucelyn said, the city should have warned him of its intentions 
before destroying his work. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi said the contractor had no way of finding Brucelyn because he did not 
apply for permits to paint on city property. "We don't know who the artist is. 
We have no permit. We have no record," Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such mishaps in the future, Bianchi said he will propose permit 
guidelines so that anyone who comes to City Hall with a mural proposal can be 
given a package listing the steps to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Twitchell has some advice for his protege. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd stay away from underpasses," Twitchell said. "You can't win the fight 
against destruction. A creator can't win a fight against a destroyer."

<P>
URBAN DECAY: THE L.A. COUNTY MEDICAL ASSN. HAS PUT ITS HEADQUARTERS NEAR 
MACARTHUR PARK UP FOR SALE, CITING DRUG ADDICTS WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER THE AREA. 
</P>

<P>
Besieged by panhandlers and drug addicts, the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. 
has put its 58-year-old headquarters building near MacArthur Park up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling 130,000-square-foot facility, which houses the Regional Poison 
Control Center and a library of rare medical books, employs 85 people and 
covers two-thirds of a city block near the crime-plagued corner of Wilshire 
Boulevard and Westlake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members and employees are being attacked," said Dr. Gary Krieger, chairman 
of the board of trustees for the nonprofit organization of 10,000 physicians. 
"We've already literally turned our parking facility into a fortress and have 
armed guards on duty at all times. 
</P>
<P>
"In talking to growth experts about the future of development in this area," 
added Krieger, "there is no reason to believe it will change appreciably any 
time soon." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the association, one of the last major employers left in the 
vicinity of MacArthur Park, is a further erosion of the economic base in the 
Westlake community. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the owners of a MacArthur Park landmark restaurant, Edward's Steak 
House, closed the establishment, driven out, they said, by crime and drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The medical organization's decision to move comes two weeks after a personal 
plea from Councilwoman Gloria Molina to forestall the sale until city policies 
to upgrade the community with new street lights and street and alley 
maintenance, among other things, can begin to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the association said the three buildings that make up the 
outdated facility are in desperate need of at least $4 million in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the officials fear that Molina wants to maintain the area as a 
low-income refuge for immigrants and small shop owners, which could stymie any 
plans to redevelop the property to attract high-end businesses and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the streets and alleys surrounding MacArthur Park have become a 
haven for up to 600 crack cocaine addicts driven out of the 30-acre park 
grounds by law enforcement officials on horses, bicycles and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Corlin, a trustee for the association, said the decision to leave 
was not an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as concerned about low-income housing and restoring the business element 
as she (Molina) is," Corlin said. "But unfortunately, her policies overlook 
certain economic realities." 
</P>
<P>
Molina could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said that despite some business problems in the area, there are many 
improvements, ranging from a community task force to identify and remedy 
neighborhood ailments to beefed-up police patrols. These, and other efforts, 
however, will take time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the association voted May 9 to put the property up for sale but 
held off on going public with the plan until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly every building on our street is up for sale," said association staff 
member Brad Kuiper. "Heck, we may not even be able to sell this place." 
</P>
<P>
Added association spokesman Bob Calverley: "There are a lot of people in this 
neighborhood who can't leave and I feel sorry for them. The vast majority of 
those who live here, however, are not crack addicts; they are working people 
who just can't afford to move."

NEWSWIRE: NINE HURT AS BASEBALL FANS RIOT IN SOUTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of baseball fans in Seoul, South Korea, stormed onto a field to 
protest their team's performance and hurled broken bottles, trash cans, rocks 
and burning chairs in a rampage that left nine people hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
President Roh Tae-woo ordered an investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor general's office said six men were being held by police for 
questioning. One of the injured was hit in the abdomen by shards of glass and 
was hospitalized in serious condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The rampage began three hours into a game between two professional teams, the 
Haitai Tigers and the Lucky Group Twins. The Twins were leading, 10-0, in the 
bottom of the seventh when the trouble started. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the riot was ignited when supporters for the losing team felt 
they were being cheated.

Showtime will pay about $2 million for the delayed broadcast rights to the Oct.

A television source familiar with the negotiations said the bout -- which will 
be available live on a pay-per-view basis -- failed to generate the delayed 
rights fee that might have been expected. Home Box Office paid about $3 million

THERE WILL BE NO HUDDLE IN BENGAL '90 OFFENSIVE SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, when Sam Wyche, the resourceful coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, 
re-introduced no-huddle football to a world that hadn't seen it for about half 
a century, his opponents charged that he was trying to wangle an unfair 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals were going for cheap penalty yards, they said, by snapping the ball 
while the defense was still making substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
In time it was clear that Wyche was legitimately playing a deeper game. By 
having quarterback Boomer Esiason call plays at the line of scrimmage instead 
of in a huddle, the Bengals were keeping the defensive team's specialists off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
By coaching the Cincinnati players to line up quickly after each play and 
threatening to snap the ball instantly, Wyche forced his opponents to stick 
with, say, a running-game defense on an obvious passing down. 
</P>
<P>
The system was so successful that the Bengals began using it about half the 
time, and last year they were in it more than 65% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive guys won't huddle at all this year," Wyche said the other day 
from Cincinnati, "except on the goal line sometimes. Out on the field, we're 
planning to no-huddle it 100%." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, in other words, have figured out a way to call their whole offense 
at the line of scrimmage. If they're the only team doing it full time this 
year, they'll have the kind of edge that often counts in football. 
</P>
<P>
The long exhibition season seems to be suggesting one thing to the Rams: 
They're deeper in wide receivers than in running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three years down the road, an NFL team in that predicament might well 
consider shifting to the run-and-shoot offense, which uses four receivers and 
one back. 
</P>
<P>
The run-and-shoot, moreover, is a formation that has only one ground play -- 
the fake-pass draw play. So it could be the right place for the Rams' 1988 top 
pick, Gaston Green, who, in more conventional NFL running formations, has yet 
to distinguish himself. 
</P>
<P>
But it's improbable that Coach John Robinson will make a change. His team, 
which will end its exhibition season Friday night at Washington, is getting too 
much passing mileage in its present system -- with Jim Everett at quarterback 
-- to consider anything else now. 
</P>
<P>
It is more likely that the Rams will elect to improve their ground game by 
throwing more first- and second-down passes to set up the run for Green. Who, 
four or five years ago, would have expected that of Robinson? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who will end their exhibition season in the Coliseum Saturday 
afternoon against the San Diego Chargers, can't tell what's ahead in the 
regular-season opener eight days later: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Denver Broncos, who will be in Los Angeles that afternoon, may or may 
not still be reeling from their recent Super Bowl defeat, their third in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And they could or could not pull the largest crowd of the Raider season. 
</P>
<P>
They usually do. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum turnout for the Raider-Bronco game last year, 90,016, was the top 
NFL crowd anywhere, including the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But that was in the heat of a division race in December, and the Broncos will 
be coming back on an early September afternoon before much interest has 
materialized in the new race. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders say there's one additional problem: Some fans who have been 
watching ESPN and other TV programs think they'll have to go to Oakland for the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Those who go to the right place will see Jay Schroeder playing so-called Raider 
football more adeptly than last year. That is, he's more often hitting the 
faraway target. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Knox, beginning his eighth year as coach of the Seattle Seahawks, finally 
reclaimed his most important offensive player late last week when Brian Blades, 
the Pro Bowl receiver who had been holding out, reported. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawks will start the season without the lineman who could be their 
best defensive player, Cortez Kennedy, the top draft pick from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, who will be taking on four improved teams in his division this season, 
said: "Nobody ever puts an asterisk behind the coach's name to notify the fans: 
'He didn't have his best players at training camp.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tapes of the Houston Oilers' first half against the Minnesota defense Sunday 
are already circulating around the league, and some coaches are nervous about 
Houston's new run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
They fear that with Warren Moon passing to his many exceptional receivers, the 
Oilers might be as effective as they're beginning to look. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings eventually won Sunday's exhibition when their third-string 
quarterback out-played the Oilers' third-stringer. But when it was first team 
against first team in the first half, Houston's run-and-shoot, as coached by 
Jack Pardee, beat back the Viking defense, which ranks with the NFL's finest. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota began by giving Moon a hard time, once throwing him for a safety en 
route to a 12-0 lead. Even then, however, one or two of Houston's four 
receivers were plainly open on every play. 
</P>
<P>
And in the second quarter, Moon got off the floor to defeat the single-covering 
Vikings with three touchdown strikes, one of which was dropped and a second 
which was called back on a penalty. Completing most of his passes the hard way 
-- on passing downs -- he also led the Oilers to still another touchdown that 
he scored on a sneak for a 14-12 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Although Minnesota's best pass rusher, Keith Millard, sat out with an injury -- 
leaving some questions about the Oilers unanswered -- Moon operated the 
run-and-shoot smoothly whenever he was in satisfactory field position. 
</P>
<P>
And against that defense, that was something of a surprise, because Houston has 
only been in its new offense for three games. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Oilers master it in time to contend this year for the AFC Central 
title? 
</P>
<P>
"They have better players than we started with last year," said Mouse Davis, 
the run-and-shoot creator who assists Coach Wayne Fontes on a Detroit team that 
has won its last eight in a row -- three of them exhibitions this summer. "A 
lot sort of depends on the selling job that (Pardee) does. 
</P>
<P>
"When you change to the run-and-shoot, one of your biggest jobs is getting the 
players to believe in it. Last year we had to convince (the Lions). This year 
they know what it can do, and we're saving a lot of time that we wasted last 
year on sales jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears nearly boycotted last week's game, walking out of practice 
one day, but in the end played the Raiders as scheduled, though not well. 
</P>
<P>
The athletes were protesting the condition of their practice field, which 
converts to mud when it rains at Bear headquarters in Lake Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
During the walkout, Bear executive Mike McCaskey went on TV to ask the Chicago 
public for financial assistance in building an indoor practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskey's appearance drew 140 tenders of help, including a suggestion from a 
woman who offered her father's barn. Not quite what the players had in mind.

<P>
HOCKEY: DESPITE NHL TITLES, THE OILERS' POCKLINGTON WAS A MISERLY GIFT-GIVER, 
KINGS' GRETZKY SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings' Wayne Gretzky has written his autobiography and, not surprisingly, 
he doesn't have many kind words for his former boss, Edmonton Oiler owner Peter 
Pocklington. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gretzky: An Autobiography," the captain of the Kings describes Pocklington 
as a cheapskate and says "sometimes he could be a complete jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Pocklington sold Gretzky to the Kings in August of 1988 for a reported $18 
million, only months after Gretzky led the Oilers to their fourth Stanley Cup 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, co-written by Rick Reilly, Gretzky says the first time the Oilers 
won the Stanley Cup, Pocklington gave diamond rings to everyone on the team. 
But the size of the diamond varied depending on how Pocklington viewed 
contributions to the team effort. 
</P>
<P>
"That meant the trainers and the equipment guys got these tiny diamonds and the 
guys who sat on the bench got a little bigger diamond, but not much, and so on 
until you-know-who got a huge one," Gretzky says in the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we'd spent the last five years trying to bang through everybody's skull 
that we were a team . . . and Peter goes and ranks us all by karat." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he didn't know anything about the rings until then-assistant coach 
John Muckler told him that the hand on the diamond meter went the wrong way 
when Muckler got his ring appraised. Muckler, assistant coach Ted Green and all 
the training staff were given fake diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says then-coach Glen Sather made Pocklington get the coaches genuine 
diamonds. "I was so embarrassed I took all the trainers' rings and had them 
done properly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says the Ferrari that Pocklington "gave" him when he tied Marcel Dionne 
for the scoring title his first year in the NHL was actually a three-year 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to pay the licensing and insurance on it and I had the option to buy it 
out at the end of the term. I ended up selling it and I think I lost $3,000 on 
the deal. Any more gifts from Peter and I was going to go broke." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he was thrilled when Pocklington gave him a $50,000 bond for his 
first-born child after he broke Gordie Howe's all-time assist record in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I found out the thing matured at $50,000 -- in 25 years. What that bond 
cost Peter was about $3,500."

OLYMPIAN GONZALES STALLED BY LOSS TO LEON; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: AFTER FAILING TO MAKE WEIGHT, HE IS BEATEN IN UNANIMOUS DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The once-promising professional boxing career of Paul Gonzales, launched with a 
gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, looked very much like it had 
gone dead in the water Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting with extreme caution and almost entirely lacking in what boxing people 
like to call "fire in the belly," Gonzales lost his second fight in 10 weeks 
when he dropped a unanimous decision to virtually unknown Mexican 18-year-old, 
Javier Leon. 
</P>
<P>
The heady days of the Olympics, when Gonzales not only won a light-flyweight 
gold medal, but the outstanding boxer award as well, seemed long, long ago 
Monday night. On the day he won a gold medal, Gonzales predicted he'd win pro 
world titles in six weight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday night, before 6,080 at the Forum, Gonzales, 26, looked like a 
very ordinary bantamweight. And an overweight one. 
</P>
<P>
Not so ordinary was a new face on the L.A. boxing scene, super- featherweight 
Genaro Hernandez, who raised his record to 20-0 with a third-round knockout of 
Richard Abila. In a third 10-rounder, Phoenix featherweight Louie Espinoza 
knocked out Fernando Teran, also in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Gonzales looked as though he had chance to be one of Los 
Angeles' great boxing attractions. He had good looks, a marvelous left jab, 
outstanding boxing skills and he came from the streets of East Los Angeles, a 
community that has been producing world-class fighters for most of this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales did nothing right Monday. He missed making weight by four pounds, 
coming in at 122. But Leon didn't make 118 either, so their bout -- a 
first-rounder in the Forum's eight-boxer bantamweight tournament -- went on. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' new trainer (he split with longtime trainer Al Stankie nearly a year 
ago), ex-bantamweight champion Albert Davila of Pomona, was livid. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he didn't make weight, and I'm very unhappy about it," Davila 
said, suggesting he'd have a long talk soon with Gonzales about his boxing 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales seemed in shock. What happened to all the cheers of '84? He was booed 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it," he said, through bloody lips. "I weighed 119 dried out 
yesterday, and I woke up this morning at 122. I've never failed to make weight 
before, not even as an amateur. I don't want to take anything away from the guy 
(Leon), but he was just a guy. I let a guy with just basic skills beat me. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm discouraged. I wanted to win this tournament (and first-place purse 
of $75,000). But I'm not going to quit. I just wasn't right tonight. I couldn't 
get off (a punch), I couldn't reach him. These things happen, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales (14-3-1) lost on an eye cut in a bantamweight title fight against 
Orlando Canizales in El Paso June 10. Leon (31-2-2), from Michoacan, wasn't 
supposed to be much of a challenge. But the much shorter, poker-faced fighter 
beat his more-famed opponent to the punch for 10 rounds, largely ignored 
Gonzales' vaunted left jab and scored repeatedly with left hooks inside and 
long lead rights. 
</P>
<P>
Two judges scored it for Leon, 95-94, and another had it 97-92. The Times card 
had Leon, 96-93. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, managed by Nori Takatani, presumably took another step toward a 
super-feather championship opportunity. His opponent was to have been Ben 
Medina, who pulled out of the fight late last week. Saturday night, he fought 
in a main event in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Abila (15-6), the sub from Las Vegas, wasn't prepared but also wasn't in 
Hernandez's league. Hernandez, 24, is a tall (5-feet-11), angular fighter. He's 
a right-hander but sets up in a squared-off fashion so as to deliver straight 
rights with the same motion as his effective left jabs. 
</P>
<P>
He's a patient fighter who likes to throw short, hard uppercuts inside. In the 
third round Monday, he chased Abila across the ring, pounding him and dumping 
him on the deck with a jolting left hook. A moment later, Abila was flat on his 
back under a bottom rope, with his handlers cutting his gloves off. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hernandez's second fight since recovering from surgery on his left hand 
last October. Although he has yet to be tested by a world class 
super-featherweight, he's ranked second by the World Boxing Assn. and No. 3 by 
the World Boxing Council.

 Into the valley of Death 
</P>
<P>
 Rode the six hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charge of the Light Brigade 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Lord Tennyson (1854) 
</P>
<P>
At the east end of the stadium in South Carolina, an orange-shirted horde will 
file past a California rock, rubbing it for luck before they run down the hill. 
At the other end, the opposition will enter, excitement and fear quickening the 
pulse rate to three digits. 
</P>
<P>
The orange shirts are used to all of this. Their crowd, 83,000 strong, is 
similarly clad. Saturday, when the Cal State Long Beach football team looks 
around Clemson Memorial Stadium, which surrounds Frank Howard Field -- the 
whole thing combining to form college football's Death Valley -- the 49ers will 
see more orange than in a Central Valley pumpkin patch. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is intimidation. And it works. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's role is clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacrificial lambs," said 49er Coach George Allen, in his first game at what 
probably will be the last stop in a long, storied career. "I've never been in a 
role like this. None of us on the staff have ever had to do anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the youngest team in Division I-A football. We have a new coach, a new 
staff, a late start on recruiting. . . . I understand we're 58-point 
underdogs." 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, however, the 49ers will be about $250,000 richer, less expenses, 
Athletic Director Corey Johnson said, adding that is 15% of the football budget 
for three hours' work. 
</P>
<P>
With apologies to Adam Smith, it's the Money Game, and nobody plays it better 
than the Big West Conference. Slightly north and west of Clemson, about seven 
hours later, Pacific will play Tennessee before about 95,000 for about 
$250,000. A week later, Cal State Fullerton will be in Auburn, Ala., to play a 
team many have touted as college football's best before 83,000 for another 
$250,000, enough to cover half of the football scholarships, Coach Gene Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also will play Mississippi State, San Jose State will play at 
Washington and Nevada Las Vegas will play at Houston for smaller -- but 
significant -- sums. 
</P>
<P>
The Auburn game was a gift to Fullerton from Pacific Coach Walt Harris, who 
decided that opening against a Tennessee-Auburn tandem might not leave his team 
anyone to line up against San Jose State on Sept. 15. Let Fullerton have 
Auburn. Pacific, instead, will play Division II Sacramento State at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Harris knows. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen: "I talked to a coach who opened against Pittsburgh and Auburn last 
year and after that he didn't have any running backs." 
</P>
<P>
The coach was Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost the only back we had who could run faster than 4.8 (seconds in the 
40-yard dash, linebacker speed at major schools), Anthony Williams," Harris 
said. "He had ripped off a 20-yard run that had been called back. Then he got a 
knee (injury) and was out the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
For the next 11 games, Andrew Thomas led Pacific with 311 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
The Money Game. It's called an economic necessity by athletic directors who 
make up the schedules. They excuse the overmatch by talking about the 
opportunity it creates to join college football Davids who have beaten Goliaths 
to the accompaniment of national headlines and exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Players buy the sales-pitch -- for a while. Then reality comes quickly. Money 
doesn't block or tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an awesome sight, compared to what we were used to," Kevin Gogerty, a 
Fullerton offensive tackle, said of playing at Louisiana State in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a color poster was distributed in Orange County. It showed the Titans 
huddled in the end zone, with Gogerty standing apart, looking up at the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to the stadium, there must have been 400 people to meet the bus," 
Gogerty said. "They yelled at us, 'Tiger bait! Tiger bait!' and called us 
names. We had to run a gantlet to get to the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mike Schaffel: "We took it as a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Schaffel played for Fullerton in 1987 against LSU (a 56-12 loss) and Florida 
(65-0) and intercepted a pass the next year at West Virginia (45-10). 
</P>
<P>
"LSU was probably my most memorable. . . . It was the first big game I'd been 
in. . . . Everybody thought, 'They get the attention, so it's our chance to 
make a name for ourselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, Fullerton was down 35-12 but, Schaffel said, "We had moved the 
ball and they had scored on long plays. We still felt good." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling didn't last, LSU turning the game into a rout late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The irony was that Fullerton paid the price for David beating Goliath. The year 
before, Miami of Ohio upset LSU in Baton Rouge. The Tigers were angry, and 
Fullerton played the $200,000 lamb. 
</P>
<P>
And the Titans still had Florida to play. "I remember the attitude was like, 
'Here we go again,' " said Jeff Taylor, a defensive end. "I remember the night 
before the game, me and Kelly Gogerty slipped out and went to a diner by the 
motel to get something to eat. Understand, this is not something we'd 
ordinarily do. But we really didn't care. The coaches came in and saw us . . . 
and didn't say a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Money Game throws players and coaches together in a peculiar sort of 
bonding that goes beyond the normal seven-days-a-week football relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want to be there any more than we did," Taylor said. "We knew we 
had to play these guys so that we could play other schools (financially). I 
sort of felt sorry for the coaches. I knew that Coach (Gene) Murphy, well this 
couldn't help him to get a chance to get picked up by any other (larger) 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy acknowledges the problem of preparing for the Money Game without 
acknowledging the effect it might have on his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through it as a player," he said. "At North Dakota, we went into 
Lincoln, Neb., to play Nebraska in 1961 (in a 33-0 loss). 
</P>
<P>
"On these games, you try to take the realistic approach. You can't say, 'If we 
play hard and don't make mistakes, we can beat Auburn.' That's a damn lie. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to take their dream away. For me to tell (quarterback) Terry 
Payne, 'We're not going to beat Auburn,' isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't (lie to) these kids. We know them, but they also know us. They 
watch our reaction and they can feel the emotional part of our preparation." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was perhaps more difficult for Pacific's Harris, who returned to 
his alma mater as head coach a year ago from a job as offensive coordinator at 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest fear is that the players would lose confidence in what we were 
coaching," he said. "I think you can score what it costs physically to play a 
game like that by the list of injuries. But you can't score the cost in 
players' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a new coaching staff, and we didn't score a touchdown until the third 
week of the season (after losing to Pittsburgh, 38-3, and Auburn, 55-0). The 
players had to think, 'At least we scored a touchdown before this (in years 
past)." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has a similar problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a new staff that I fear could be judged by playing Clemson," Allen said. 
"That's like a reporter going out and his first story is interviewing the 
President of the United States. And his career is going to be judged by that 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson awaits with a new coaching staff that wants to impress their fans and 
those who pay the coaches' salaries. And with players who want to impress the 
staff to get future playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee will be playing its second game after rallying for a 31-31 tie Sunday 
in Anaheim against Colorado. And Auburn plays the poll game: the bigger the 
winning margin, the more votes. 
</P>
<P>
There is little mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at Tennessee, we'd play Colorado State and New Mexico," Harris 
said. "We knew we'd win, but we wanted to win good. We knew what would happen. 
The only thing we didn't know was when it would happen." 
</P>
<P>
So, how do you approach the game as a sacrificial lamb? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing Coach Murphy was most worried about was people getting 
hurt," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Murphy, quoting a coaching axiom, "Look, you can't coach not getting hurt. 
You're less likely to get hurt if you just hit as hard as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy would simplify the game plan, said some of the players, leaving trick 
plays for games against UNLV and Pacific. He would use short passes -- "Well, 
with the pass rush, you can't throw long," he said -- to limit injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing I do," Murphy said. "I tell my quarterbacks to take a 
look at the play clock and snap the ball when it gets down to two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Fewer plays, fewer opportunities to lose receivers that you will need against 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"And you look for the positive things," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
What could be positive in being beaten, 65-0? 
</P>
<P>
"There's something positive in every game," Murphy said. "You find it. 
</P>
<P>
"And you tell 'em you love 'em." 
</P>
<P>
The Money Game. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we, as a conference, happy about it?" asked Big West Commissioner Jim 
Haney. "No, we aren't. . . . I don't think that when you go out and get beaten 
badly, it looks good for the conference. But if you look at some of the scores 
of our games against these big teams and scores of games between those teams 
and other teams that maybe aren't as good in their own conferences, they aren't 
so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt has to play Tennessee and Wake Forest has to play Clemson. But Long 
Beach doesn't have to go to Death Valley. Pacific doesn't have to go to 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're taking some action," Haney said. "We're looking to reduce 
conference games from seven to six. Maybe that will mean one less road trip to 
pay for. Maybe instead of going on the road to play for a bigger guarantee, we 
can go play for a smaller guarantee. There are more teams in Division I-A that 
we can compete with than teams we can't." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, skip Death Valley and play in Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
But the image problem lingers. 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty is that people focus on it and wonder if the schools in our 
conference should even be playing I-A football," Haney said. "We have seen 
positive things, like first-round draft choices, but people are seeing us being 
overwhelmed and wondering if Fullerton or Long Beach should be playing I-A 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA requirements for Division I-A status, each school in the Big West 
except Fresno State, with its 30,000 stadium and 32,500 average, would fail to 
qualify for Division I-A without the Money Game. 
</P>
<P>
Those rules require an average home attendance of 17,000 and a stadium capacity 
of 30,000. Fullerton's Santa Ana Stadium and Long Beach's Veterans Stadium seat 
12,500, and crowds of 3,000 are the norm. But another rule allows an overall 
average of 20,000 for all games to qualify for Division I status. When you play 
Clemson before 83,000, you can play host to Pacific before 3,000 next week and 
be I-A. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to. 
</P>
<P>
And the players do. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went to LSU, we all thought, 'Now, this is college football,' " 
Schaffel said. "The support, the fans, the facilities . . . this is what 
college football is all about." 
</P>
<P>
There was universal envy among players who largely weren't recruited by the 
money schools. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic directors want the games as well. 
</P>
<P>
They are faced with running programs on limited resources, and the chance to 
get $250,000 for a Saturday afternoon is too good to resist. 
</P>
<P>
But the coaches aren't as excited. "I hate money games, hate them," Allen said 
before he had even coached one. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris: "We shouldn't be playing them. We are trying to build a program, 
and you can't build a program playing those kinds of teams." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of heading East, he said, there is an alternative that two of the Big 
West schools -- Fresno State and San Jose State -- have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be playing the Pac-10 schools," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"A big indication was our game against Arizona (a 38-14 loss) last year. They 
were 15th-ranked when we played them, and they had their first-string defense 
in in the fourth quarter. Our players felt we could play them. I could see it 
in the eyes of our players before the game -- a look that wasn't there when we 
played Auburn and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids went to high school with their kids, played against their kids in 
high school. They know each other. They were just recruited by different 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We could play well against Tennessee and still get beat 60, 70 to nothing. I 
don't think USC could beat us 60 or 70 to nothing in the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
Allen suggests a different alternative: "I'd be a lot happier if we were 
opening against Redlands."

UCLA COACHES LOST CONFIDENCE IN HIM, DEPARTED ODOM SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Odom, regarded by one recruiting publication as among the nation's top 
50 prospects when he signed with UCLA two years ago, said that he left the 
Bruin basketball program last week because he believed that the coaches lost 
confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could have competed at UCLA and if not started this year, started by 
my junior or senior year," said Odom, a 6-foot-11 center from Kingwood, Tex. "I 
just didn't feel I was going to progress as a player. I didn't feel like Coach 
(Jim Harrick) expected enough out of me. I want to go to a college where the 
coach is going to expect something of me and have confidence in me. That's 
mainly why I transferred." 
</P>
<P>
When Southland recruits Ed O'Bannon and Shon Tarver announced this month that 
they will enroll at UCLA this year, Odom said, "It just kind of made me think 
that I wasn't in the picture. I just didn't feel like I fit in very well." 
</P>
<P>
Odom said Monday that he will transfer to San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Tex. 
Signed by UCLA after making recruiting trips to Notre Dame, Syracuse, North 
Carolina Charlotte and Auburn, Odom never played for the Bruins, red-shirting 
as a freshman. He averaged 20.4 points and 11.8 rebounds as a senior at 
Kingwood High. 
</P>
<P>
Odom said he plans to transfer to a major college next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I go, I'm going to know that the coach has confidence in me," he said. 
"I'm going to know the coach is going to interact with me as a person -- not 
only as a basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick was out of town Monday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Odom is the third player to leave the Bruin program this summer, following 
Darrin Dafney, who transferred to Drake, and Kevin Williams, who said that he 
will remain at UCLA but will forgo his final season of eligibility.

STUDYING SIDE EFFECTS OF HORMONE THERAPY; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONAL HEALTH: A UCLA STUDY SEEKS THE BEST APPROACH TO HORMONE REPLACEMENT 
THERAPY IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AND ITS ROLE IN BREAST CANCER AND HEART 
DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like many women, Anne Berkovitz had decided against taking hormones after 
menopause. But she often wondered whether she'd made the right decision. Among 
her friends, the topic was always a source of debate. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear one person's doctor say you must take it and another person's doctor 
says you shouldn't take it if you can get by without it," says Berkovitz, 64, 
of Westwood. "I was feeling OK not taking hormones. But I had sort of wondered 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hormone replacement therapy is a drug treatment commonly prescribed to women 
after menopause to replace natural hormones the body has stopped manufacturing. 
The therapy is popular because it diminishes some uncomfortable side effects of 
menopause, such as hot flashes, and can reduce a woman's risk of osteoporosis 
and, possibly, heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
But the treatment has drawbacks, including a possible increased risk of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity led Berkovitz to enroll as a participant in one of the largest 
clinical studies on hormone replacement therapy, and the first drug trial to 
study its effects on heart disease. The study will begin soon at UCLA and six 
other research institutions. UCLA researchers hope to enroll another 75 women. 
</P>
<P>
The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) study should help 
define the dosage and combination of hormones that best reduce the risk of 
heart disease in women, the leading cause of death in women as well as men, 
says Dr. Howard Judd, executive director of the division of reproductive 
endocrinology at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai medical centers. PEPI is sponsored by 
the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
"Estrogen is such a powerful chemical; it impacts on so many systems in the 
body," says Judd, who is directing UCLA's part of the study. "Our hope is that 
we'll be able to say, based on cardiovascular-disease risk factors, 'this is 
the best way to take hormones.' " 
</P>
<P>
While men and women share some risk factors for heart disease, such as a 
high-fat diet or family history, female hormones produced by the body 
apparently help protect women against heart disease before age 50 -- when men 
are at their peak risk. 
</P>
<P>
But after menopause, when hormone production ceases, the rate of heart disease 
in women quickly climbs and eventually equals the rate in men. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of evidence now accumulating that estrogen plays a role in 
heart disease. How it does that is not clear," Judd says. "We would suggest 
that an agent that may reduce the incidence of heart disease by 50%, maybe 60%, 
in more than half the population is worth studying. This is a very important 
question that needs to be answered. And I believe it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Estrogen appears to lower the bad cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins) in the 
body and raise the good cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins) to reduce the 
chance of heart disease. But those possible benefits, while exciting, further 
complicate a therapy that is already enormously complex and the source of much 
consternation among postmenopausal women and their physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Estrogen and progesterone are hormones produced by the ovaries; they regulate 
the menstrual cycle and fertility. At menopause, about age 45 to 50, the 
ovaries stop producing the hormones. 
</P>
<P>
While the absence of a menstrual period is a welcomed event for many women, 
menopause can trigger uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes and thinning 
of the vaginal and urinary tissues. The drop in hormones also causes bone 
thinning and increases a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition 
in which bones easily break or fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Hormone replacement therapy resolves many of these problems. And, with the 
addition of possible cardiovascular benefits, it's easy to see why hormone 
therapy -- which usually consists of a mixture of estrogen and a 
progesterone-like chemical called progestin -- is prescribed for 5 to 9 million 
women. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite its popularity, the debate over hormone replacement continues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are combinations of reasons and advantages for using estrogen," says Dr. 
Ezra Davidson, president of the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Drew Medical School. 
"In many instances, physicians are totaling those combined advantages and 
advising women of the benefits. But there is insufficient data about the 
risks." 
</P>
<P>
Besides minor side effects, such as menstrual bleeding, estrogen replacement is 
known to promote the growth of uterine tissue, called the endometrium, which 
can lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that adding progestin to the regimen removes the risk of 
endometrial cancer, so physicians usually prescribe progestin for part of the 
month. But progestin therapy opens the door to a whole new set of complex side 
effects, says Barbara Hulka, an epidemiologist at the University of North 
Carolina and chairwoman of a government advisory committee on women's health 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
For example, progestin appears to erase the cardiovascular protection of 
estrogen. And some studies show progestin increases a woman's risk of breast 
cancer.

"The quandary is basically the issue of taking estrogen alone versus estrogen 
plus progestin," Hulka says. "Estrogen alone does cause a growth of the 
endometrial lining and does cause endometrial cancer in a significant number of 
women. That's why it's been recommended to add progestin for half the month." 
</P>
<P>
Fears that estrogen-progestin therapy will increase the risk of breast cancer 
were elevated last summer when a Swedish study revealed that women who took a 
combination of estrogen and progestin for more than six years were more than 
four times as likely as other women to develop breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies have not shown as great a risk, and the significance of the 
Swedish study is debated, Judd says. 
</P>
<P>
"That data shows more risk than U.S. data," Judd says. "Whether or not that 
will be substantiated or not, I don't know. Many of us felt like (the Swedish) 
data were over-interpreted." 
</P>
<P>
But the study did underscore the need for a better understanding of the risks 
and benefits of hormone therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration approved new warnings 
regarding breast cancer risk on the labels of estrogen therapy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a more controversial move, an FDA advisory panel concluded in July that 
estrogen taken alone (without progestin) helps prevent heart disease in women 
who have had hysterectomies. Because women who have had their uteruses removed 
do not run the risk of endometrial cancer, the committee deemed that estrogen 
alone would be beneficial in this group, says Davidson, who was a member of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee made a prudent judgment based on the information on benefits, 
with the understanding that (the information) was limited about the long-term 
risks," says Davidson, who added that some committee members had reservations 
about making any recommendations on estrogen therapy and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation by the committee -- which might persuade the FDA to allow a 
change in the labeling of estrogen to include protection against heart disease 
for women who have had hysterectomies -- was criticized by some physicians and 
consumer health groups. 
</P>
<P>
The National Women's Health Network said in a statement that studies have not 
been done to verify that the potential protective effects of estrogen 
replacement therapy outweigh the risks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is alarming to think that millions of women may be given this drug before 
either its dangers or benefits are understood," says Davi Birnbaum, a 
representative of the Washington-based women's health organization. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendation, which is only for women who have had 
hysterectomies, leaves postmenopausal women who have not had hysterectomies in 
limbo, says Dr. Diana Petitti of the University of California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"The data on estrogen use alone in postmenopausal women are fairly consistent 
in showing a lower risk of coronary heart disease," she says. "But most women 
are not put on estrogen alone. And the data to show whether or not the 
combination of estrogen and progestin also decrease the risk of coronary heart 
disease is essentially non-existent." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA advisory panel based its recommendations on a series of small 
observational studies, called epidemiological studies, not the expensive, 
clinical trials that are usually more conclusive, Judd says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the advisory panel recommendation) is premature because it's based 
exclusively on epidemiological studies," he says. "You've got to do drug 
trials. For something this important that impacts on every woman in the 
country, we've got to spend money." 
</P>
<P>
The PEPI study was designed to fill this void, Judd says. In the study, 840 
women will be randomly assigned to one of five drug regimens: a placebo; 
estrogen alone; the standard combination of estrogen and progestin widely 
prescribed in the United States; estrogen and a smaller, daily dose of 
progestin, and, estrogen with a new formulation of progestin created in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Women will be followed for three years while their risk factors for heart 
disease, such as high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are measured. 
</P>
<P>
The study also will incorporate measurements of bone density to learn more 
about the prevention of osteoporosis. The PEPI study will not attempt to 
resolve the issue of breast cancer risks. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the study are expected in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains a question of what do you do in the interim between now and the 
time when we'll have an answer," Petitti says. "Do you want to take the risk of 
taking the drug and being wrong? Or do your take the risk of not taking the 
drug and being wrong? I consider it to be an incredibly hard choice." 
</P>
<P>
With so many questions remaining, physicians need to review each woman's 
circumstances and fears before prescribing hormone replacement therapy, says 
Petitti. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the clinicians who are trying to handle their patients on an 
individual basis are doing the best job," she says. "Someone terrified of 
breast cancer may not want to take the potential risk of breast cancer. But 
someone has a mother or aunt who had a osteoporotic bone fracture may say 'I 
don't want that to happen to me and I don't care as much about the risk of 
breast cancer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Experts caution that it will take a long-term study, perhaps several decades, 
looking at causes of death among women to resolve whether hormone replacement 
therapy actually prolongs life or merely swaps one risk for another. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the PEPI study will be useful," Petitti says. "But the bottom line 
will not be addressed by the PEPI study. The bottom line is, will it save our 
lives? I don't think any single study will answer that question." 
</P>

Individuals interested in volunteering for the Postmenopausal 
Estrogen/Progestin Interventions study must be healthy women, age 45-64, who 
have had a natural or surgical menopause and are willing to take hormones. 
</P>
<P>
The participants will receive periodic free medical examinations over a 
three-year period.

WOMEN AND HEART ATTACKS 
</P>
<P>
While heart disease in men often occurs in their 20s and 30s, heart disease in 
women soars after age 50. Medical experts believe this might be due, in part, 
to the loss of natural estrogen hormone during menopause.

NEW YORK'S FINEST ANSWER A NEW CALL; 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIZATIONS: RETIRED NYPD OFFICERS WHO MOVED TO CALIFORNIA HAVE SET UP THEIR 
OWN '10-13' CLUB TO MEET THEIR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS.

<P>
Theirs is an unspoken, unbreakable bond, a "blood brother" kinship nurtured 
3,000 miles away on the streets of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
For years, these four men -- Joe Vanderhoff, Jerry Murphy, Frank Lamden and 
Jack Feehan -- worked as New York City cops, patrolling some of most desolate 
and deadly neighborhoods in the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn, handling 
everything from domestic violence and robberies to riots. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when each retired from the New York City force and sought escape from the 
sweltering summers and freezing winters, the frenetic pace and the overwhelming 
blight, each moved West and resettled in Southern California to take on new 
jobs and start new lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Living out here is like paradise, a Shangri-La," said Murphy, 51, who served 
22 years as a NYPD patrolman. "You know what? Every morning, I face Sacramento 
and kiss the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his offhanded, jovial comment, Murphy, like the others, knows also that 
the memories of their days on the force can still haunt them -- 3,000 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderhoff, 42, a patrolman who retired in 1980 after suffering line-of-duty 
injuries, put it this way: "All of us have seen enough blood and death and 
human suffering to last a lifetime. A lot of it never really leaves you." 
</P>
<P>
Which helps explain why these four Orange County men have become members of a 
highly specialized, little-known organization called the California 10-13 Club. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a society that seems to have a support group for virtually every 
conceivable cause, the California 10-13 Club is one of the most unusual yet: a 
group exclusively for retired officers of the New York City police force. 
</P>
<P>
True, this 250-member club, whose members are mostly from San Diego, Orange and 
Los Angeles counties, has its social side -- a time for rollicking, 
alumni-styled joking and remembering of good times. 
</P>
<P>
But the club also serves a solemn role. Quietly and behind the scenes, the 
group acts as a support network for members in mental or physical distress, 
including those suffering traumas from having worked in one of the most 
harrowing of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
This function of the club is written into the group's name, "10-13," which is 
the NYPD's radio code for "officer needs assistance." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter who our guys are, no matter where they live," Vanderhoff explained, 
"we answer their call for help -- just as if we were still out there with them 
on the city streets." 
</P>
<P>
During all their years on the New York City force and their early years in 
Orange County, these four retired officers had never met. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising when you think about it. I mean, New York is a big city, 
and we had 30,000 men on the force. And when you moved out here, the guys just 
seemed to vanish," said Feehan, 58, who retired in 1972 as a sergeant after 18 
years on the NYPD force. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Feehan and the others met when California 10-13 Club 
organizers, using a NYPD retiree roster, mailed club flyers throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the biggest surprise for these police expatriates was the sizable 
numbers of retired officers found in California. Out of the 250 club members, 
55 are in Orange County, 20 in Los Angeles County, 150 in San Diego County -- 
the rest scattered as far as Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought there were that many out here," said Lamden, 51, who spent 16 
years as a NYPD patrolman. "You figure Florida, yeah, because that's always 
been a New Yorker retiree colony. But not this far, not 3,000 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
Although the California 10-13 Club has grown steadily since 1986, particularly 
in San Diego and Orange counties, it is still overshadowed by the vastly larger 
memberships in New York State (10,000 members) and in Florida (6,000 members), 
where the first club was founded 12 years ago in the Palm Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still the only club network like this in the nation -- one that is only 
for the retired members of a single city police department," said California 
10-13 Club president Norman Finkelstein, 47, of San Diego, a retired police 
lieutenant. (Prospective members can call him at (619) 232-1815; the next 
meeting is Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. in the El Toro Marine Corp Air Station officers 
club.). 
</P>
<P>
The membership age range in California, typical of all the 10-13 clubs, is 40s 
to 80s. About a third work at other jobs, such as private attorneys -- 
Finkelstein is one -- as private or public investigators or as businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Orange County member Feehan is a welfare-fraud investigator for 
Orange County. Murphy is a partner in a surveillance and legal services firm. 
Lamden is a private security guard. And Vanderhoff, who has worked as a federal 
Treasury investigator, is now studying law. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other "10-13" clubs, the California group also serves as an advocate 
for improving retirement-benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
But it is as an emotional support group that the club has had its most poignant 
moments. The California contingent has provided 10-13 Club honor guards at 
funerals for members. It has assisted families of deceased members for things 
like housing relocation. It has kept in close touch with critically ill 
members, including those suffering from cancer, strokes or Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the visits with members who have undergone major emotional 
disruptions that can be traced directly to the darkest memories from their time 
on the New York City beat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that this kind of mental stress can be devastating -- the 
occupational hazard of just being a cop," said Vanderhoff. "Our kind of job has 
resulted in one of the highest divorce, alcoholism and suicide rates of any 
field." 
</P>
<P>
"So we have (club members) who need one-on-one help -- to be able to talk their 
problems out, to deal with them by sharing with other officers," added Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy remembers this kind of relentless stress all too well. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't escape it. It was all around you. The stabbings, the shootings, 
the bodies," said Murphy. "But cops are like anyone else. After a while, all 
this takes its toll. You begin to hurt. You begin to bleed -- mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Feehan depicted it this way: "You learned, emotionally, to try and throw up a 
protective wall. You tried to leave it when you got off your shift. But it 
became harder and harder to turn off. To really forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot of my old case notebooks," he added. "But I never go 
through them. There's too many bad memories in them -- incidents that I want to 
put out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Vanderhoff still remembers with painfully vivid detail his involvement in four 
shoot-outs -- especially the first one, after a taxi-garage holdup during which 
the dispatcher had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We were chasing down the three guys. Each of them was armed. Then one of them 
stopped and fired right at me," recalled Vanderhoff. "The bullet just grazed my 
head. It was that close. I fired back, killing him." 
</P>
<P>
For years, said Vanderhoff, "I had the feeling that I would never survive as a 
cop, that I would be killed in my 30s or 40s. I even had my cemetery plot all 
picked out -- I was that sure. I never thought I would live long enough to 
retire." 
</P>
<P>
Today, 3,000 miles away, some of the memories of being police officers are now 
calmer, more personally rewarding for these California 10-13 Club members. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt we were doing something for the social good, for the whole 
community, despite all the digs some people have made about police. We had a 
real purpose," said Lamden. "It was a feeling that stuck with you, a real sense 
of job satisfaction. It helped carry you through the bad days." 
</P>
<P>
For some, this sense of pride in being a cop showed in the job lineage. 
Vanderhoff wore the same shield (badge), No. 5348, that his paternal 
grandfather, Francis, also a NYPD patrolman, had worn. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's two sons, Dennis, 27, and Timothy, 25, are on the New York City force, 
as well as Timothy's wife, Anne Marie. And Dennis is wearing his father's old 
shield, No. 8745. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's feelings are mixed about this. "I was real proud of them because they 
picked my profession. It was reaffirmation for me and my profession -- because 
I really loved that job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, "I was furious when they told me they wanted to join the 
force," Murphy said. "I had always wanted something better for them. Hell, I 
didn't want them to go out on the streets . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Such darker memories resurface whenever Murphy and the others read of a slain 
law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
This was the case last June , when Fullerton police officer Tommy De La Rosa, 
43, an undercover narcotics agent, was shot to death in Downey in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral was attended by more than 5,000 fellow officers, including Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I wanted to be there," said Murphy, who that day had proudly pinned his 
old NYPD No. 8745 to his dark civilian suit. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Murphy added: "Sure, I had to be there -- to represent the 10-13 Club 
guys. He was our blood brother, too."

FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR ARTIST'S QUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARITA NIETO, Nieto is on the Southern California Advisory Council of the 
Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art.

<TEXT>
<P>
In its most significant aspects, contemporary art is ugly . . . a threat to the 
ordering of society and man's concept of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leon Golub 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Marzorati first viewed Leon Golub's work in January, 1982, at the Susan 
Caldwell Gallery in Soho. He was drawn in by a sign on the door: "Please be 
advised that the current exhibition at Susan Caldwell Inc., may be 
inappropriate for viewing by children." 
</P>
<P>
Marzorati's gut reaction to the "theatricality" of the sign was both cynical 
and skeptical. What child today, he wondered, could be shocked by a work of art 
in a Soho gallery? Obviously this was a clumsy attempt at public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Six large portraits of mercenaries, torturers and their victims (entitled 
"Mercenaries" and "Interrogation") filled two rooms, dissipating Marzorati's 
initial skepticism. In describing his initial reaction to the work, Marzorati 
recalls their morbid beauty and a "sense that they were not simply stunning, 
but true. . . . These men, Golub was saying, are us." 
</P>
<P>
This initial visit to the Susan Caldwell Gallery sets off the narrative of "A 
Painter of Darkness." The book records events that took place between 1982 and 
1988, and focuses on visits to Golub's studio as well as on the Iran-Contra 
hearings (July, 1987) and the presidential election of November, 1988. Because 
of these perspectives, it is simultaneously a critical commentary on the 
politics of the time as well as on creativity and social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Golub's paintings depict a world dominated by violence. In the series of 
works he has produced steadily since 1950, his images of suffering and torture 
draw upon an historical understanding of the human condition. Committed to 
exploring the dimensions of the underbelly of humankind, Golub has consistently 
ignored the fleeting trends and fashions of the contemporary art scene. 
</P>
<P>
During the dominant years of Abstract Expressionism, when social commitment was 
passe, he probed the "horrors" of the world through a figurative style that 
drew on both the Expressionist and Realist traditions. Golub evokes Goya, 
Nolde, Munch, the Picasso of the "Guernica" and Bacon on the one hand, and 
continues the tradition of Edward Hopper, Carl Sandburg and the American 
Realist School on the other. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, Marzorati, a senior editor for Harpers magazine and a regular 
contributor to ARTnews and Vanity Fair, chronicles Golub's role in American 
contemporary art. It is a curious book in that it has few illustrations. 
Marzorati combines art history and social commentary, biography and interview 
to re-create the historical events of the last 30 years that were reflected 
(and reflected on) in Golub's work. The book is at once a good read and a 
stimulating study on the scholarly question of art and social commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Golub's artistic journey to a large degree reflects the Midwestern experience 
of the 1930s, '40s and '50s. His father, born in the Ukraine, wanted to study 
drama but instead became a public-health doctor; his Lithuanian-born mother was 
descended from a long line of rabbis. Born in Chicago in 1921, Golub was just 
12 when his father died, leaving his mother with a small pension. An older 
sister was the main wage earner. 
</P>
<P>
Yet from an early age, Golub was encouraged to pursue his own interests, 
notably art classes through the Depression W.P.A. programs and at school. At 
Wright Junior College and later at the University of Chicago, he studied art 
history, but World War II interrupted his studies. He enlisted in the Army and 
served in Europe, returning to the States in 1946. Uncertain about his future 
as an art historian, he changed his course of study, enrolling at the School of 
the Art Institute of Chicago. His feelings about the world around him, his 
"recognition of estrangement, of domination and violence, of existential 
fatality," led to his making art that expressed those realities. 
</P>
<P>
Those beginnings marked a career that has never wavered from an uncompromising 
commitment to investigating the relationships between art and society. Golub's 
participation in the touring exhibition, "A Different War: Vietnam in Art" 
(which comes to UCLA in March of 1991), for example, is not limited to his own 
works on display. He played a seminal role in the Artists Protest Committee in 
the mid-1960s, the first organized group of artists to take a stand against the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
A strength in Marzorati's work is that he never limits himself to an analysis 
or critique of the images. Instead, by reflecting on the concept of the 
painter's place within his time, he succeeds in shedding light on Golub's lone 
quest during those years when American art looked inward and away from society. 
In so doing, he also offers a new paradigm of interpretation applicable to the 
understanding of American contemporary art.

Time runs out Saturday on the Soviet government's self-imposed deadline to 
agree on a plan for saving the country's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to be patterned after a crash, 500-day plan already 
adopted by radical leaders of the vast Russian republic. That scheme calls for 
a mass selloff of government property, cancellation of state subsidies and 
eventual removal of almost all price controls. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cut short his vacation to oversee the 
finishing touches, but despite what he has called "enormous progress" on it, 
the final plan must still win approval from national and republican 
legislatures.

<P>
South Africa's ruling National Party, battling to hold onto white voters 
nervous about apartheid reforms, meets in this southeastern coastal city 
Thursday and Friday for its first provincial congress since President Frederik 
W. de Klerk's election 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Its biggest problem is retaining white support long enough to prove that the 
reform process can bring the country together and end its international 
ostracism. But recent black factional fighting near Johannesburg has fueled 
white fears of a future black-led government.

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cpl. Christopher C. and Pfc. Norman M. sit companionably on the roof of an 
all-terrain vehicle they've christened Sarah Jane, tending to a TOW anti-tank 
missile launcher between them and waiting for the ration box in front of the 
truck to turn into a swimming pool. You know. The way it does in the beer 
commercial. The one where the leggy woman walks out holding two frosty beer 
bottles, and somebody says, "Where did that come from?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they'd be happy if the pizza would just get there. "We ordered 
Domino's three weeks ago," Norman deadpanned. "It ain't got here yet." 
</P>
<P>
But as the mercury crawls past 113 degrees, the only hint of water is a distant 
mirage hovering out across the miles of scrub and hot sand, out past a line of 
high-voltage electrical lines and a gray ribbon of road they've stared at so 
long it's starting to dance on the desert floor. That's the road the Iraqi 
tanks would come speeding down from the north. That's the road where the 
missile goes. 
</P>
<P>
They play poker for swallows of water out of their canteens to pass the hours 
until lunch -- a lukewarm, vacuum-packed, mass-produced, field-issue tray of 
beef stew and assorted bland accompaniments known as an MRE -- "meal, 
ready-to-eat." They're carefully calculated at 3,600 calories per serving. The 
water in the canteens is the temperature of hot tea. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fixin' on goin' for a swim in that manage," says Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"Mirage," grunts Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
In the Saudi Arabian desert, which has become an inhospitable home away from 
home for the largest American troop deployment since the Vietnam War, comfort 
is where you find it. A patch of shade near the radiator grill of a truck. A 
stolen splash of water rubbed furtively across the face. A foxhole in the sand 
with a spread-out bedroll. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting the troops in the field has become a round-the-clock proposition for 
several central logistics centers, responsible for dispensing the more than 1 
billion pounds of ammunition, weapons, food, uniforms and other supplies being 
shipped and airlifted into Saudi Arabia for a troop force that soon could reach 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military logistics experts on the ground in Saudi Arabia only last weekend 
went on a new work schedule that is merely punishing instead of debilitating. 
They now work 20 hours and get four hours off; before it was 36 hours on and 
four off. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal is to build a 30 day supply of food, ammunition, and any other 
materiel the troops in the field will need, according to Maj. Gen. William G. 
Pagonis, who is overseeing the supply operation as commanding general of the 
army's central support command. 
</P>
<P>
Camped in tent cities, prefabricated housing and occasional empty buildings 
across the desert, simple things -- things like breakfast and showers, laundry 
and toilet paper -- have become major undertakings for the first wave of 
American soldiers setting down on Saudi soil. 
</P>
<P>
The initial field kitchen designed to feed 250 soldiers from the 1st Tactical 
Fighter Wing was actually serving more than 1,000 by the time the second and 
finally a third opened up. Army personnel on the Air Force base have been 
shepherded into the enlisted men's club, quickly dubbed "Mission Inn." A few 
divisions contracted with local Hardee's fast-food branches to supply thousands 
of burgers and fries for daily lunch. For soldiers on exercises in the field, 
sometimes for three days at a stretch, it's MRE. 
</P>
<P>
Water has been an even more formidable obstacle. In the searing desert heat, 
each soldier must drink anywhere from 4 to 6 gallons a day depending on how 
long he's out in the sun. Each also consumes up to 14 more gallons daily -- 
shaving, brushing teeth, showering, cooking. In places where there's potable 
water, canteens filled out of the faucet do the trick. Otherwise, it's bottled 
mineral water hauled in by truck, or 5,000-gallon "water buffalo" storage tanks 
pulled on trailers out to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the most remote locations, reverse-osmosis water purification units trucked 
in with the troops can take brackish well water, saltwater, stagnant water, 
even muddy water and make it drinkable -- at a rate of up to 3,000 gallons an 
hour. Over lunch at a desert mess hall one day, a question about how the 
soldiers' water tasted elicited a host of responses, of which only one was 
printable: "It tastes like pool water," said a corporal from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
At many camps, troops are now limited to three-minute showers, three times a 
week, and no running water while shaving. 
</P>
<P>
The 82nd Airborne Division, the first unit to hit the ground in Saudi Arabia, 
at first set up camp in tents and used Saudi military bathroom facilities, 
where the showers do double duty as toilets. Breakfast at first was fruit 
bread, water and perhaps an orange. Lunch and dinner were provided by Saudis 
under contract with the U.S. military, and cases of "Saddam's Revenge" became 
almost as frequent as heat exhaustion complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get enough to eat. It's just that some of the guys are scared to eat 
some of it," a 21-year-old private said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a large portion of the division has moved into prefab barracks, 
four bunk beds stacked nose to nose in a series of tiny ill-lit -- but 
air-conditioned -- rooms. The Hardee's beef sandwiches have started arriving 
for lunch, and there's meat and chicken with canned vegetables and pudding for 
dinner. Even better, the Red Cross came through last week with a box of 
luxuries like razors, shaving cream, lip balm, hard candy, chewing gum, soap 
and shower shoes. 
</P>
<P>
All of which might make life pretty bearable if it weren't for the fact that 
much of the 82nd right now is miles from nowhere, and figures to stay there for 
quite some time. With Saudi concerns about American soldiers mixing in their 
strict Islamic society, off-camp leaves are out of the question for now and 
on-camp there's precious little to do. The boredom already has become 
excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
Some play cards. A few soldiers last week managed to make a volleyball out of 
some tape and scrap material. Gradually, copies of USA Today and videos of CNN 
coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis have begun filtering in. But most of the 
day is spent attending training classes and -- a few hours at a time, gradually 
increasing every day -- moving around in the blistering desert heat outside the 
barracks in an attempt to adjust to the punishing climate. 
</P>
<P>
"Gotta give them time to go back, write a letter and think," said Col. Ron 
Rokosz, a brigade commander for the 82nd from Chicago. "But you've gotta 
balance that. You leave 'em alone too long, they start feeling sorry for 
themselves. It's a problem. If we give 'em a day off, what would they do?" 
</P>
<P>
Also, according to Pagonis, too much air conditioning can be bad. "You don't 
want them to live in an air conditioned environment and then expect them to go 
out in the desert and fight or train or do anything. Once they arrive in 
country, and get used to the weather, the worst thing you can do is dump them 
in an air conditioned building and then expect them to go out and train or do 
an exercise." 
</P>
<P>
A young private in the mortar brigade, setting up a camouflage net over his 
weapon, talked about the food, and the diarrhea, and the heat, and shrugged. 
"We're always told we're just soldiers," he said, "and we're here to do what 
we're told to do, no matter what it takes. So that's what we're gonna do. No 
matter how long it takes." 
</P>
<P>
The 82nd Airborne prides itself on being able to touch down, combat-ready, 
anywhere in the world in 18 hours, often by parachute. It was the 82nd that led 
the way into Panama and, a couple of generations before that, Normandy. It 
trains in Alaska, and the tropics, and in the California desert at Ft. Erwin 
and Twentynine Palms, to be ready for any kind of warfare in any kind of 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the same as the Mojave Desert," a sergeant major said on the 
way out to exercises last week. "Ft. Erwin was maybe a little more hilly. But 
let's face it, there are five different deserts, and they all look the same. 
This one's got oil under it." 
</P>
<P>
One day last week, in the largest such exercise since American troops began 
arriving in Saudi Arabia, a unit from the 82nd launched out into the desert, 
simulating what might happen if a column of Iraqi tanks suddenly churned down 
from the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
One officer unofficially dubbed the operation "Sweat in the Sun" -- an apt 
description considering that rivulets of perspiration were pouring down the 
sergeant major's cheeks when the first of hundreds of all-terrain vehicles set 
off just before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, sarj major!" a flag boy screamed as the sergeant major's vehicle 
roared away. "Air-BORNE, you're welcome!" he replied, wiping the first dust off 
his goggles before turning good-naturedly to a reporter and pointing to a nest 
of rocks nearby. "They get here, we'll kill 'em. Kill 'em easy," he declared, 
and then launched into an oration on the virtues of the TOW missile. "When they 
first came out, Israel used 'em in the war against Egypt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
How did they perform, the reporter wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"They won." The sergeant major wasn't the only one feeling the heat by 
midmorning. Every soldier was wearing heavy camouflage fatigues, a helmet and 
heavy combat boots, and carrying on his body an ammunition pouch, two one-quart 
canteens of water, a bayonet and a chemical gas mask. Rucksacks weighing 
anywhere from 60 to 80 pounds had eight more quarts of water, a chemical 
weapons protective suit, socks, a T-shirt and bedroll. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the day would be spent scouting out firing, communications and 
first-aid stations, setting up guns and mortar launchers, practicing putting 
the guns into firing positions, figuring out how to keep the dust out of the 
weapons and how to keep the radios running in temperatures that would exceed 
120 degrees by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Moving out into the desert in a long column of trucks, the sergeant major 
stopped inside a ring of low dunes that would become the unit's headquarters 
for the day's operations. Radios would be set up there, but the sergeant major 
simply looked blankly at someone who wanted to know if the 82nd would have 
access to photographic or satellite communications facilities in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We ain't got none of that 'hooby gooby' stuff," he said finally. "We're 
soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
For the current exercise, field commanders figured they'd have anywhere from 24 
to 48 hours' warning after enemy tanks cross the border before the armored 
units reached their positions, their numbers perhaps depleted by more than 30% 
by bombing runs from the Air Force's A-10s, F-16s and F-15s and, even further 
down the line, the Army's Apache attack helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
To ambush the tanks along their routes and lure them into designated "kill 
zones" nearby, the division has an anti-tank arsenal of TOW missiles, Dragons 
and AT-4s, along with assorted mortars, artillery and rifles. Even so, it will 
not be the 82nd's job to stop the invaders, but merely to delay them until they 
can be stopped at some undisclosed point farther south, probably because their 
supply lines from Kuwait will have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how the tanks will deploy for combat once they have been ambushed 
from the road cannot be absolutely anticipated, said Col. Rokosz, speaking in 
response to repeated, detailed questions. "I've been attacked by Iraqi tanks 
about as often as you have," he said finally. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what the ground forces of the 82nd can do against a huge line of 
tanks may be limited, he said. "If they mass 40 divisions on the border, they 
could put the whole goddamn army here and we couldn't stop 'em. The air war's 
gonna be real, real essential." 
</P>
<P>
The TOWs, with a range greater than the firing range of the tanks, can probably 
pick off a large proportion of the leaders as they lumber in, and artillery and 
mortar rounds are capable of knocking out fuel tanks and antennas on many of 
the rest. But it is the infantry that will be the first physical line of 
defense against any armament that proceeds into the engagement area -- a line 
of young men, their bodies dug in the sand behind an occasional scrub brush, 
holding AT-4 anti-tank weapons and rifles to their shoulders, a human shield 
against the oncoming tanks until the artillery platoon can move into final 
defensive positions. 
</P>
<P>
New infantrymen must combat the inevitable fear that arises from the idea of an 
enemy tank bearing down on them, and to do that, they are often placed in 
foxholes during training exercises with tanks repeatedly driving over them. 
They are reminded that they will be extremely difficult to see from the tank, 
where visibility is likely to be limited to a periscope. 
</P>
<P>
"As I sit here, I look at what I have at my disposal," said a young Rosebud, 
Tex., infantryman dug into the sand with two weapons, one of them capable of 
halting a tank if it scores a hit in the side or the rear. "It doesn't look 
like much, but I have a lot of confidence in my equipment," he said. "Most of 
their equipment is Russian-made, and they say the quality of the Russian-made 
equipment isn't very high, and they can't get more when they need it. On the 
other hand, we're getting a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
"It's always like that. Some guys may get caught behind on their own," said one 
of the platoon commanders. "They may have to take out some tanks on their own. 
But that's the way war is." 
</P>
<P>
Up on a low ridge of sand that passes for a hill, Norman and Christopher are 
looking out over the searing fields of flat sand stretching out in every 
direction, interrupted only by an occasional scrub brush. They can see all the 
way out to the road, and past it. "This right here is TOW heaven," says 
Christopher. "We could fire a ways on down there, and there's no place for them 
to hide. We can spot them coming from miles away. You could practically hit 
anything out there you wanted to, and probably before they came within firing 
range of you." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of their colleagues in the field that day, the primary enemy for 
Christopher and Norman is not the Iraqi army but the baking heat and the 
boredom, sitting atop Sarah Jane for hours at a stretch, their elbows on the 
TOW launcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty dismal place," Christopher says, gazing out across the 
featureless sand. "It does get kind of depressing, so we have to try and pull 
together and cheer each other up. We signed the papers and took the oath that 
we'd defend it to the death, and so here we are." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been worse places, I guess," Norman says, and then their supervisor, 
Staff Sgt. Kent, walks up. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else can you stand out in the middle of nowhere? There's absolutely 
nothing out here. Except camels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The three of them are silent for a minute. "I think most of the guys would just 
like to go home," Kent says finally. "But if the only way to go home is through 
Kuwait, then we'll go through Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Things They Carry To Keep Going 
</P>
<P>
Each combat U.S. infantryman on duty in Saudi Arabia carries more than $2,000 
worth of clothing and equipment, according to the Department of the Army. Much 
of it is standard issue, although some, starting with a sand-colored camouflage 
uniform, is tailored to the desert environment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that troops need 20 gallons of water per day per soldier, 
including six gallons for drinking in the 100-degree-plus temperature and 
fourteen gallons more for cooking, personal hygiene, and washing clothes. In 
all, the infantryman either wears or carries around 100 pounds of gear when 
fully outfitted. Including:

KEEPING THINGS UP TO DATE IN KENNEBUNKPORT;

<P>
WHEN THE PRESIDENT TRAVELS TO MAINE, AN AMAZING ARRAY OF COMMUNICATIONS 
GADGETRY GOES WITH HIM.

KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This sleepy seacoast village may not seem like the sort of place where the 
President of the United States can keep abreast of the crisis in the Middle 
East, but during times like this it frequently serves as Command Central. 
</P>
<P>
The "White House" -- as all of its modern-day occupants have found -- isn't 
just a term to describe the Greek Revival mansion in which the President lives. 
It is a bureaucratic, movable feast that the President takes with him wherever 
he goes. 
</P>
<P>
But whether it's the "Western White House" of Ronald Reagan or the 
"Kennebunkport White House" of George Bush, the portable banquet comes with 
secure telephones, secure faxes and aides who quietly say, "Mr. President, we 
have the prime minister on the line. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In the case of President Bush, that dazzling array of electronic accouterments 
gets the maximum test -- particularly in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Haven't you seen the telephone in my golf cart? Or boat? Word of honor," Bush 
said to reporters on his way up here as he sought to quell any concerns that he 
might be out of touch far from Washington in the northeast corner of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The President wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours after he arrived here on Aug. 10, the White House put out the word 
that Bush had just finished going over an Arab League statement with his 
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, in Washington -- via a cellular 
telephone aboard his speedboat, Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 a.m. each day, while most people are asleep -- or perhaps groping for 
their morning coffee -- Bush says he is reaching for a telephone to call the 
White House situation room in Washington for an early update on overnight 
developments in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Early one morning last week, Bush received his daily national security briefing 
aboard the Coast Guard cutter Monomoy, bobbing on the Atlantic swells -- from 
his deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
And especially during times of international crisis, the wires -- or telephone 
circuits -- here are buzzing all day. "George Bush's first instinct is to get 
on the phone and call around," says a former White House aide who has watched 
the President closely. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since arriving in Kennebunkport, the President has spoken by telephone 
with about a dozen foreign leaders. And he has welcomed several others to his 
stone-and-frame home here for lengthy conversations about the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The briefing on the Monomoy and the telephone calls on the Fidelity certainly 
were attention-grabbers, but they reflected a point the White House has taken 
considerable pains to make during the three weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait: 
Although critics have contended that Bush should be shepherding the crisis from 
Washington, aides say he is just as closely in touch in Kennebunkport as he 
would be in the Oval Office or in the Situation Room. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the President in touch is the work of an obscure branch of the Army 
Signal Corps known as the White House Communications Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in a rented home in Kennebunkport, the unit has set up a switchboard 
that essentially parallels the communications facilities in the White House 
both in its power and in its capability. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the President ventures beyond Walker's Point -- the 11-acre Bush 
family compound that juts out into the Atlantic -- a ubiquitous black Chevy van 
bedecked with high-powered antennas quietly follows, ready to send and receive 
signals worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the van, at the very end of a presidential motorcade, wending its way 
from Walker's Point to the Cape Arundel Golf Club. There it is, engine at idle, 
parked to the side of the road as the President jogs down a dirt path. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Griscom, a former assistant to Reagan, concedes that the notion that 
a President can stay in touch when he's far away from Washington is difficult 
for some people to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have a hard time accepting the fact you can take the White 
House on the road," Griscom says. 
</P>
<P>
But he insists that "it's not difficult at all to provide the logistic support" 
outside Washington. Indeed, in recent years, White House technicians have set 
up "fully functional" communications facilities in such unlikely places as 
Moscow and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. A few years ago, before the invention of secure 
facsimile machines, the White House used to dispatch airplanes, laden with 
packages of Very Important Papers for the Commander in Chief, whenever a 
President went to places such as Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
Even during the Reagan and Richard M. Nixon years, such cross-country flights 
were not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
But today, there is less need for such courier flights because fax machines can 
transmit classified documents without danger that the equipment can be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
Still, all is not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that Bush would be spending a lot of time here, White 
House advance personnel went looking for a nearby hotel to use for office 
space. They settled on the Nonantum, which has broad picture windows 
overlooking the Kennebunk River and the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as soon as they had installed their communications gear, however, the 
security experts discovered that their voices could be picked up by boats at 
sea with microphones that are sensitive enough to translate the vibrations from 
the window glass back into sound. 
</P>
<P>
So, they're worried that while Bush may be staying in touch with his staff -- 
and with prime ministers around the globe -- the Kennebunkport White House may 
also be inadvertently transmitting to sailors aboard a Soviet listening-vessel 
just beyond the U.S. territorial limits. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned.

SOVIET FARM REFORM PLAN FAILS TO TAKE ROOT; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV THOUGHT FARMERS WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK LAND UNDER A LEASE WITH THE 
STATE. BUT FARMERS IN ONE SOVIET PROVINCE ARE SAYING NYET.

KRASNODAR, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pyotr Drobov calls himself a man of strong nerves, and not just because he 
raises bulls. Not only does he work shoulder-to-shoulder every day with tons of 
short-tempered bull flesh, but he risks his own money doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Drobov, 43, is an arendator, or leaseholder, one of the very few in this 
bountiful region of the southern Soviet Union to take up the government's offer 
allowing individual farmers their own holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The arenda program is perhaps the most touted of the agricultural reforms that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hopes will help this shortage-plagued country to 
feed itself. Begun in the fall of 1988, it assumes that farmers will be more 
productive if they are the "masters" of their land rather than cogs in the vast 
state farm system. An arendator effectively breaks off a chunk of a large 
collective farm and runs it under contract to the farm management. 
</P>
<P>
But here in Krasnodar province on the shores of the Black and Azov seas -- 
known as some of the richest land in the Soviet Union -- the program is not 
catching on. And Drobov said it is easy to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
"People see how much work it is, and how we've been deceived, and they say 
they'll wait and see," Drobov commented. "I think this whole movement of arenda 
has completely stalled." 
</P>
<P>
Outside his stable, amid swarming flies and pungent odors of hay and manure, 
the intense, work-hardened man told a tale of dogged perseverance and 
frustrated initiative. 
</P>
<P>
In need of money to build a house so that his two sons could settle with him on 
the Korenovsk Elite-Seed state farm, Drobov decided to give arenda a try soon 
after the program was announced. 
</P>
<P>
A trained cattleman, he gained approval from the state farm's chairman to take 
over 90 head of the local black-spotted breed, but the terms he was forced to 
accept, he said, were so niggardly he could barely make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying his meat at relatively low prices, the collective farm 
takes 45% of Drobov's profits under the arrangement. His income is based on 
what's left, minus several other deductions for things like the feed he must 
buy from the farm. 
</P>
<P>
"The arendator works like under serfdom," Drobov said. "What they give you is 
what you get." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the farm postponed renewing his contract for several months, leaving 
him uncertain about whether he would be able to continue his leasehold and how 
much money he could expect to make. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been unable to get equipment that would lighten some of his 
back-breaking workload, although he did manage to obtain a small tractor -- a 
major victory. 
</P>
<P>
Drobov said he found that he has no chance of winning whenever he butts heads 
with the farm chairman, and has come to believe that local authorities, 
unwilling to give up their control of the farm system, are intent on squelching 
leaseholding. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run Soviet press, at first filled with rosy accounts of family-run 
farms springing up, has begun to focus more on the headaches that drive them 
out of business. Gorbachev, himself a farm boy, has complained that 
leaseholders are regarded by their jealous neighbors as "Rockefellers." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to leaseholders in May, Gorbachev bemoaned their problems, noting 
that they have trouble obtaining even such simple supplies as nails. 
</P>
<P>
"All this should be sold in stores," he said, "so that leaseholders could just 
drive to a store and buy what they need" -- a novel concept in a country where 
most agricultural supplies have been distributed through Moscow-based 
ministries for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president also promised to issue a decree that would force resistant 
local authorities to put the two-year-old law on leasing into practice. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, that decree has not come out. And meanwhile, Krasnodar region's 
leaders do not hide their disdain for the idea of breaking up the 
plantation-sized holdings created at such horrendous human cost during the 
forced collectivization period in 1929-30. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai I. Kondratenko, head of Krasnodar's regional council, complained in an 
interview in his airy office that the region has been branded conservative for 
its opposition to private farming. 
</P>
<P>
But "the whole world is moving toward concentration and specialization" in 
farming, he argued. "Now that we've come to industrial technologies, even if 
through grief and suffering, to destroy them would be insanity." 
</P>
<P>
Kondratenko agreed that the Soviet farmer must be made to feel more like the 
owner of his land, but said that could be accomplished through other reforms, 
including selling farmers shares in their collective farms and dividing up 
income proportionally. 
</P>
<P>
He also backed greater independence for farms and increasing the size of the 
private plots where rural residents are allowed to grow fruits and vegetables 
and sell them as small-scale entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
As the arenda program functions now, Kondratenko said, "a big farm may be 
working pretty well, and then along comes a person who says: 'Give me land. I 
want to be a private owner.' Does he have a right to it? He does." 
</P>
<P>
But authorities are reluctant to give away land when that may mean it will be 
farmed less efficiently, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, today, this farmer has found out the advantages of collective farms" 
and the greater efficiency of working on a large scale, Kondratenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Drobov seems to have discovered the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
For all the restrictions, supply problems and conflicts, Drobov figures he is 
now earning three times the 250 rubles per month (about $400 at the official 
exchange rate) that an ordinary cattleman earns on a state farm. All he has to 
do is work at least 10 hours a day, seven days a week, without vacations. 
</P>
<P>
And the emotional rewards, he said, cannot compare. 
</P>
<P>
"I so love this work," Drobov said. "I'm small, but I'm a master. I watch what 
comes in and what goes out, and it's a joy to my soul."

</P>

DEBT IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE IN MEXICO, THE CHAIRMAN OF CITICORP SAID RECENTLY. 
AND HE MAY BE RIGHT AS INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN SLICED AND FOREIGN INVESTORS 
ARE COMING BACK.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico's largest single creditor surprised executives gathered for a luncheon 
at a colonial mansion here last month. 
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis is over, John Reed, chairman of New York's Citicorp, told 
members of the American Chamber of Commerce, referring to the nation ranked 
second only to Brazil among the indebted countries of the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
"Debt is not an issue in Mexico -- not an issue with international banks in 
regard to Mexico," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A year after Mexico became the first country to sign a debt reduction agreement 
under a plan initiated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, domestic 
interest rates have been cut in half and investment is slowly flowing back into 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico is even able to borrow money abroad again although not from commercial 
banks. In the last even months, the government-owned telephone, electric-power 
and oil companies have all raised funds by selling bonds on either European or 
U.S. financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not all attributable to the debt deal," said Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's 
undersecretary of the Treasury for international finance matters. "Without 
appropriate economic measures, you would not have these (improvements). But I 
think it can all be traced back to having done the debt deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Brady Plan "debt deal" is a scheme under which commercial banks forgive 
part of the sums they are owed by developing nations or reduce the interest 
rates that they are charging. In return, the remainder of their loans are 
effectively guaranteed by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and 
the wealthy industrial countries that support those organizations. 
</P>
<P>
While there is some debate about the practice, the plan offers a good deal for 
both lender and borrower, in theory. 
</P>
<P>
For the indebted countries, which have seen a larger and larger share of their 
wealth required just to pay interest on their mounting debts, it promises some 
relief -- maybe even enough to generate the kind of real economic growth that 
might one day pull them out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
And for the lenders facing the prospect of having more and more of their huge 
overseas loans go bad, it offers the chance to limit those losses. 
</P>
<P>
Since Mexico signed that first Brady Plan agreement, the Philippines, Costa 
Rica, Venezuela and Morocco have negotiated debt reductions with banks. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank considers another 14 nations -- all middle-ranking in terms of 
income and with mainly bank debts -- to be prospects for Brady-style debt 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) placed 
the number higher, at 34, based on a U.S. Treasury report. In all, Third World 
countries owe a total of about $279 billion to commercial banks. So, it's clear 
that a lot of people have an interest in how the year-old concept is working. 
</P>
<P>
Participants -- creditor banks, debtor countries, the World Bank and especially 
the U.S. Treasury Department -- are outwardly enthusiastic about results. But 
outside analysts are more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those trying to make up their minds as to whether the plan might 
work for them can hear the money clock ticking. 
</P>
<P>
The $30 billion to $35 billion in financing available under the debt reduction 
initiative "is not enough to support programs for all 19 Brady countries," 
according to the World Bank's World Development Report 1990. ECLAC estimates 
the financing needs to be three times the amount available. 
</P>
<P>
The implication is that those who do not settle soon may be left out 
completely, unless other sources of money are found. 
</P>
<P>
And whatever their lingering doubts, no one wants to be left out. While the 
long-term effects of the plan are open to debate, it stands at the moment as 
the only solution outside of default being offered to countries with bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
Since the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, just meeting the interest payments due 
on their borrowings has been a major obstacle to growth in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Debt payments were equal to one-fifth of the region's exports last year, 
according to World Bank figures. Both Mexico and Venezuela paid more in debt 
payments than they made in oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
Constant debt renegotiations were not providing an answer, either for the 
countries doing the borrowing or for the banks to which they are indebted. 
</P>
<P>
Peru also reduced its payments, and other major debtors, notably Brazil and 
Argentina, periodically stopped paying. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady Plan allows different options for reducing debts. 
</P>
<P>
One option, for example, is for a country to "buy back" its debt at a discount, 
using money borrowed from the World Bank in combination with another agency or 
government. Or it can "exchange" the debt for new bonds, guaranteed by those 
international institutions or industrialized countries, that either have a 
lower value or pay a reduced interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has cautioned that these arrangements leave the developing 
countries heavily in debt -- just to different lenders. There is also concern 
that the indebted countries are borrowing money to effect these complex 
debt-reduction arrangements that might be better used for development projects. 
</P>
<P>
"All the agreements have been quite complicated, and assessments of them have 
varied," according to the U.N. World Economic Survey 1990. "However, when all 
the relevant aspects are taken into account, the benefits estimated are modest, 
and the solution to the developing country debt problem seems once again to 
have eluded the international community." 
</P>
<P>
The exact terms of any Brady Plan debt-reduction depends on negotiations 
between the creditor banks and the indebted countries. And the banks have so 
far proven to be hard bargainers. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, for example, had hoped to cut its debt payments by two-thirds, but now 
that the talks are done, the country is paying about one-third less, saving 
from $3.4 billion to $4 billion a year, depending on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gurria, Mexico's principal debt negotiator during the eight years of the 
crisis, shrugged off the difference between the goal and the outcome as "horse 
trading." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico proposed that the banks forgive 55% of its debt; the banks offered 15%. 
They settled for 35%. That set the framework for the second option -- the one 
on which Mexico and its banks finally agreed: a reduction to a 6.25% fixed 
interest rate from variable rates that had been over 9% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for Mexico, said Gurria, is that although it still owes a total 
of $87 billion to its various long-term creditors (including both banks and 
other governments), the interest rate savings mean that its payments are now 
equal to what they would have been on an $80-billion debt before Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Outside analysts are skeptical about the gains, however. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations report concludes that neither the Philippines nor Mexico 
benefited more than they would have under the type of debt renegotiations that 
have been the norm over the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
On another point, however, bankers, analysts, and government officials all 
appear to agree: a key measure of success still eludes the countries that have 
struck Brady Plan deals. "When will banks lend again?" Citicorp's Reed was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time for bank and pension fund money to come back, outside 
of stock-market investments," conceded the man whose bank has loaned Mexico 
$2.2 billion. "But Mexico will gain access to the markets and get new money. It 
could not be done today, but it could in the future." 
</P>
<P>
A Fiscal Remedy Called Brady Plan 
</P>
<P>
Five countries have signed debt reduction agreements under the plan devised by 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, right. As many as 16 other nations 
are candidates for assistance. 
</P>

Severly indebted. middle-income countries are the most likely to receive debt 
relief.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was from a point not far from this strip of grass and beach that the British 
explorer John Hanning Speke gazed over the blue waters of Lake Victoria in 1858 
and made a judgment -- seemingly audacious at the time, but ultimately proved 
correct -- that it was the source of the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
Ringed by graceful hills and dotted by lush islands that Africans had been 
cultivating and pasturing for centuries, Lake Victoria invited such boldness. 
No one who viewed its shores could doubt that the lake harbored wealth as 
majestic as the monarch after whom Speke named it. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria would prove to be, after Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in 
the world. The neighboring land was the most productive in the region, 
sustaining some of Africa's proudest tribes. The water nurtured a bounty of 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
As if to testify to Victoria's potential, on one recent day the grass running 
up from the beach at Kasenyi glimmered with silver. The sparkles were fish 
scales, stripped by an army of fishermen's wives from the mounds of perch 
dotting the field under swarms of flies, awaiting transport to city markets. 
Yet the story the scales tell is really not about abundance. It is about a 
coming famine. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, the talk from the fishermen who ply the inshore bays in shallow 
dhows and from the buyers who throng the piers is of scarcity. The most 
cherished fish, the tastiest and most valuable, have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"Labeo, for instance," said George Latigo, a fisheries official observing the 
catch at Kasenyi. "I haven't seen one of those caught in five years. If one 
lands, everyone rushes to buy it, because it's very delicious. That's a species 
that is becoming extinct." 
</P>
<P>
It is one of many. Lake Victoria, under its glittering surface, is dying. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that as many as 300 species of indigenous fish have disappeared 
from this lake in the last 10 years, an unparalleled environmental calamity. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's ecosystem has changed so dramatically that any environmental survey 
of its waters dated before 1975 is worthless. Plans calling for new 
fish-processing plants need to be rewritten, proposals for trawler fleets 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
The villain of this story is man, of course, but his weapon was another fish. 
In 1962 fisheries officials of Uganda and Kenya, hoping to increase the lake's 
output of food, stocked it with an exotic fish known as the Nile perch. 
</P>
<P>
The voracious predator has unexpectedly ravaged the schools of indigenous fish. 
Now that most of the perch's own food is gone, scientists say, another of its 
remarkable habits is becoming apparent: It is a cannibal. 
</P>
<P>
The extinction of the native schools is more than a scientific issue here; it 
bears ominous implications for the health and livelihoods of thousands of 
lake-shore dwellers and millions of Africans dependent on fish for protein. 
Malnutrition has already begun to rise on the Kenyan side of the lake, where 
fish has long been a cheap staple protein. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Victoria underscores the difficulty of husbanding natural resources 
in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Africa is not a region of environmental impact statements and involved public 
debates over conservation; this is a place where development opportunities are 
so scarce, the few that exist are often hastily exploited to exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria, observes A. W. Kudhongania, director of the Uganda Freshwater 
Fisheries Research Organization, has long been a laboratory of ecological 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The protection of the lake is complicated by a 2,100-mile shoreline that falls 
within three countries not always on the best of terms. In the 1950s, Kenya, 
Uganda and Tanzania (then Tanganyika) all tried to impose fishing restrictions 
to protect the resource; by 1962 each had conceded the impossibility of 
regulating an international lake and thrown their waters open to indiscriminate 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
The perch is only the most destructive of the many changes men have wrought 
here. Textile and paper mills have gone up on shore, their effluent fouling the 
water. Kenya built a causeway to one of its islands from the mainland, closing 
a strait through which lake currents circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Overfishing on Victoria was observed by Westerners as long ago as 1928, more 
than 30 years before the perch appeared, said Kudhongania. More recently, the 
unsophisticated fishermen have jeopardized their own futures by depositing on 
shore a lot that should be left in the water. 
</P>
<P>
This is the result of beach seining, in which weighted nets are strung out from 
the shore and left overnight to gather fish. When they are dragged in at 
daybreak, their bottom edges scrape the lake clean, stripping it of fish eggs 
and the plants serving as their nursery. 
</P>
<P>
As fish become more scarce, the fishermen set out nets with progressively 
smaller mesh, taking younger fish that should be left to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of most of these species has been caused by the action of 
man, not the Nile perch," Kudhongania said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been periodic surges of fishing activity so intense that some 
portion of the lake is fairly vacuumed clean. In 1976, Tanzania erected a 
modern fish meal plant at the southernmost point of the lake and sent a fleet 
of four trawlers out into its Mwanza Bay for abundant sardine-like species 
called haplochromines. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1979 there were no fish to process in Mwanza Bay," said John Okedi, 
chairman of the zoology department at Uganda's respected Makarere University, 
who spent the 1970s in Mwanza in exile from Idi Amin's dictatorship. The 
trawlers were beached and the plant shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
Yet few actions seem to have packed as much destructive wallop, and been 
implemented with such little advance study, as the introduction of perch. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nile perch was introduced basically on sentiment," said Okedi, who was a 
young marine researcher at the time. "No work had been done on its biology. We 
started to pay attention to those aspects after the damage was done." 
</P>
<P>
The program was controversial from the start. Twenty-five years ago the 
dominant fish were 300 species of haplochromines, all too small to be 
efficiently caught by the lake's "artisanal" -- that is, unmechanized -- 
fishermen. It was as if all this living matter was going to waste by eluding 
the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Okedi: "The argument was to introduce a big predator fish to convert 
these tiny bony fishes into big fillets," as if they were recycling factories 
with fins. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists warned that the impact of an alien fish on a delicately balanced 
ecosystem was unpredictable. But they lost the battle. One day in 1962 Ugandan 
officials dumped about 35 perch fry off the pier at Entebbe, about five miles 
south of Kasenyi. A year later, 335 more joined them. Soon Kenya followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
For several years nothing happened. A lakewide survey in 1970 found that 
tilapia and bagrus (a catfish popular as food) were maintaining their 
traditional share of about a quarter of the catch. As both a portion of the 
catch and of the lake's "biomass," or its total living matter, Nile perch did 
not register as statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, however, the perch overwhelmed everything. By 1980 it was 
half of the catch, by 1985 as much as 95%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the stockers' arguments appeared to have been borne out, for total 
landings had boomed as well. Almost all of the tremendous increase in the catch 
from 1977 to 1985 could be traced to the growth in the perch fishery. It was a 
phenomenon that even today does not go unremarked around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"For these people this fish has been the biggest blessing, in terms of income," 
said the Rev. Marinus Tielen, a Dutch missionary who has preached for nearly 30 
years on the Kenyan lake shore from a gaily painted church built to resemble a 
fully rigged dhow. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it did not take long for the Lake Victoria fishermen to come to regard the 
perch as a mixed blessing. They were the first to notice that bagrus and labeo 
were no longer filling their nets. The marketplace noticed next: The prices of 
those increasingly rare fish soared, as did that of the tilapia, which for many 
lifetimes had been the most popular food fish. Prices slumped for the 
odd-tasting but abundant perch. 
</P>
<P>
Today perch fetch less than 50 cents a pound at the market; tilapia, so prized 
that many restaurants in Uganda and Kenya keep it listed on the menu while 
secretly serving perch, brings five times that much for each 2-pound specimen. 
</P>
<P>
On the fish piers around the lake the dynamics of the food chain have not been 
much of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"These big ones are eating all the other fish," remarks fisherman Agustine 
Sari, indicating a yellow bucket of perch with the needle he is using to repair 
his net. 
</P>
<P>
So far the fishermen's incomes have stayed afloat only because of the huge 
abundance of perch. But that is bound to be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was true in the short term that the Nile perch was a boon," said David 
Wiley, director of the African Studies Center of Michigan State University and 
a student of the Lake Victoria fishing ground. "Over the last 10 to 15 years 
the fishermen reaped the harvest as the Nile perch ate up the bonanza of 13 
million years of evolution. So there were these huge, wonderful fish to 
harvest." 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years the perch have been getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they're catching any size Nile perch in some areas," said Kudhongania. He 
holds his thumb and index finger an inch apart. "They've been catching perch 
this small!" 
</P>
<P>
In some villages on the Kenya side of the lake, said Wiley, almost all of the 
perch catch is of immature fish, meaning the fishermen are mortgaging their 
future by cutting into the perch's reproductive cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governments around the lake have yet to catch up with the 
limitations of Lake Victoria. Kenya and Uganda are both proceeding with plans 
to construct fish-processing plants like the ghost structure haunting the 
Tanzanian shoreline; 11 trawlers are scheduled to be launched to collect the 
raw material. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wrong assumption that the lake can be fished so heavily," remarked 
Makarere University's Okedi. "The authorities have not listened to our advice, 
but we say that within five years, you'll have no resources to fill these 
factories." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "I think we've reached the climax of Nile perch, and from now on 
the population will decline very rapidly. That will spell doom for the 
fishermen, and malnutrition for the people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dying Source of Life 
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria, source of the Nile, is a textbook case of ecological 
destruction, with 300 species of fish having disappeared over the last decade. 
Among the reasons: industrial dumping, overfishing and the introduction of the 
ravenous Nile Perch, which began gobbling up smaller fish and is now eating its 
own kind.

<P>
Differences on the sensitive issue of abortion law in united Germany threatened 
Monday to torpedo negotiations on a treaty setting out the political conditions 
for unification, which is scheduled for Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Because any agreement at this stage is likely to be only temporary, these 
differences, mainly in West Germany, mean that abortion will almost certainly 
be one of the hotly debated moral issues in the post-unity years. 
</P>
<P>
Other differences are still to be resolved in the treaty talks, but the 
abortion issue is the most problematic, according to some of the people 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
After a marathon session broke up early Monday, leaders of the major West 
German parties agreed to meet again today. They hope to complete the 
negotiations by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The problem centers on how to reconcile East Germany's liberal law, under which 
abortion is provided on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with the 
West German law, which permits abortions only on limited social and medical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
All parties agree that both laws should remain in force, at least for a time, 
but they disagree sharply on how. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, under the influence 
of the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, wants the law applied on the 
basis of a woman's legal residence, and many West German women believe this to 
be highly discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
They say that a woman in Hamburg, in what is now West Germany, who went to 
Dresden, in what is now East Germany, for an abortion could be subject to 
criminal prosecution when she got home, although a woman living in Dresden 
could have an abortion legally. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Democrats admit that there are contradictions in their stand but 
argue that any other compromise would dilute the strength of the law as it 
applies in what is now West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German Social Democrats, who are the main opposition party, take a harsh 
view of the Christian Democratic position. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats propose that both laws continue to stand in the regions 
where they now apply, regardless of where an abortion patient lives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the majority of women want, it is what the majority in the (West 
German) Bundestag want, it is what a majority in the (East German) Volkskammer 
want," said Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats have said they will veto the unity treaty if Kohl insists 
on including the residence rule. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats have drawn no such line. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to approve the treaty would not stop unification, but it would make the 
process messy. Instead of a formal, bilateral accord on the conditions for 
merger, there would be a hastily drawn West German law on such matters as 
finance, education and property. 
</P>
<P>
Such a bill would need only a simple majority, but it would add to the 
impression that the unification process has become more of a West German 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans want to keep their liberal abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
There is widespread agreement that a united Germany needs a complete overhaul 
of the abortion legislation. 
</P>

In East Germany, abortion on demand has become commonplace, but the question of 
health risk has been raised. About 73,000 abortions were performed last year, 
in a country of 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, a country with four times as many people, the number of legal 
abortions was roughly the same.

DENALI NATIONAL PARK, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the state where license plates carry the proud motto, The Last 
Frontier. This also seems to be the year for the question: So, what do we do 
now, when there is not enough frontier to go around? 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials, who control 60% of the terrain in Alaska, are embroiled in 
the issue all across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Here at Denali, for instance, the National Park Service is facing a potential 
crisis over a private plan to open the very center of this huge and famous 
national park to new development. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a shocking development for free-spirited Alaskans, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service has reluctantly taken management of game hunting throughout 
much of Alaska away from the state. Federal authorities say they acted to 
preserve adequate herds of animals and settle a hellfire dispute between big 
game sportsmen and old-fashioned subsistence hunters. 
</P>
<P>
And, to the southeast, federal officials find themselves torn over a law that 
gives huge cruise ships greater access than traditional fishermen to the waters 
of Glacier Bay National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who come here having read Jack London and thinking 
that's the way it is," said John Quinley, public affairs officer for national 
parks in Alaska. "They are surprised to run smack into large commercial tourist 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
None of these frontier problems are resolved, but each illustrates the 
pressures bearing down on the Far North's great outdoors in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denali National Park 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people who come to Denali, home of 20,300-foot Mt. McKinley, have 
one thing on their mind. They want to see wildlife, in the wild. And the vast 
majority of the nearly 200,000 visitors get into the park one way -- by bus. 
They buy tickets on Monday for a Tuesday bus ride and then line up at 5:45 a.m. 
to get a choice seat. Sometimes they ride the cramped buses for 10 hours on a 
corkscrew, one-lane dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them think the effort is worth it. They have driven hundreds of miles 
in their own vehicles to get here. They have seen few animals. Today is their 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"We planned our two-week trip to Alaska around this day. On this bus," said 
Caryl Rawls of Memphis, Tenn. At midway on her trip, the 40 people on her 
yellow school bus have seen a half-dozen grizzlies, a score of caribou, any 
number of Dall sheep, ptarmigan and other creatures. 
</P>
<P>
It's cold, a rain has started. But Rawls and the other bus riders are thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until they hear that the Denali buses are in danger of being 
restricted from driving deep into the park. The reason? Private landowners in 
the center of the park control 1,300 or so acres in an area known as Kantishna, 
and one such landowner is considering development that would permit private 
recreational vehicles on the 89-mile, stomach-churning road. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service lawyers concede that a private landowner has the right to use the 
road under the law that enlarged Denali park in 1980. And, if a landowner wants 
to bring in RVs, maybe 200 at a time, he can. 
</P>
<P>
But park Supt. Russ Berry says that, if RVs start clogging the road, the 
interior of the park may have to be closed to the buses. That's because of the 
danger of increased traffic on a road scraped out across sheer cliff faces and 
over winding passes. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the road could be widened. Or another road built. But Berry and 
environmental groups believe heavy traffic would ruin the very thing that makes 
Denali special -- its dense and undisturbed wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ashbrook plays the role of "villain" in the drama. He holds a mining claim 
that he wants to develop into a camping resort. He is a good-natured sourdough 
who complains that his private-property rights are being ignored by a 
government that practically gives away the park to private concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
In an 80-year-old log cabin on the tailings of his placer mine, Ashbrook pulls 
on his woolly beard and teases visitors about his plans to build a jet runway 
to bring in tourists. Or maybe he's not teasing. Maybe he'll set up a 
do-it-yourself mining attraction. He's got land in the middle of the most 
heavily visited national park in Alaska. And he's got his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Berry has chosen to take the matter seriously and to bring it to a head 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a crisis yet. It's a symptom," said Berry, an experienced 
political hand. "Whether it is this time and this particular individual or 
another time and another individual, we are going to have conflicts over use of 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
Because of increasing tourist pressure, Ashbrook predicts there will be 
development in the park eventually, either his or something even larger under 
park service license to a concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Berry takes a different view. "The National Park Service has to face an issue 
-- and it really hasn't yet," he said. "We're going to have to start telling 
people the theater is full, the next performance will be . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Hunting Privileges 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Alaskans who live in the bush, whether ancient bands of Indians 
or modern back-to-the-earth settlers, have enjoyed special hunting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
If they are 50 miles from a store and facing a 30-below winter, the reasoning 
goes, they need the right to live off the land. Subsistence hunters, they are 
called. They are allowed to kill more game than others. Federal law recognizes 
their favored place in Alaskan society. So did state fish and game officials. 
</P>
<P>
But sport hunters filed suit. And the Alaska Supreme Court this year sided with 
them. Special hunting rights for anyone violates the equal protection 
provisions of the state constitution, the court held. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature met in special session this summer to draw a compromise. No 
agreement was achieved. Then, on July 1, Alaska saw control of hunting on 
federal lands taken out of its hands by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
This has never happened before in any state. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities say they acted reluctantly but had no choice because of 
U.S. law that sets game management priorities for Alaska. First priority is 
maintenance of healthy animal populations. Second goes to subsistence hunting. 
Then sport hunting. Potentially, federal officials seek a lower kill. 
</P>
<P>
State officials responded by declaring that every Alaska resident has 
subsistence hunting rights, whether an Anchorage stockbroker or Indian villager 
along the Arctic Circle. By enlarging the number of hunters who can bag more 
game, the potential is to increase the kill. 
</P>
<P>
The first people to feel the squeeze are out-of-state hunters, who have no 
subsistence claims here. Somewhere between 10% and 30% of hunting licenses are 
now purchased by non- residents. The number may be small, but the industry 
these hunters support -- the guides and bush pilots and wilderness camps -- is 
large. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some hunts in some areas have been closed to non-residents. And state 
fish and game officials say the closures are almost sure to increase, 
particularly for game animals commonly used for food, including moose and elk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glacier Bay National Park 
</P>
<P>
After Denali, Glacier Bay is the next most-visited national park in Alaska. 
Sightseers, about 150,000 a year, come by boat, usually a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
At a rate of two a day during the short summer season, the cruise ships make 
109 daylong visits a year, prowling the horseshoe-shaped bowl. This park is a 
showcase for whales and other marine life and for the blue-water glaciers and 
the still-evolving forces that shaped so much of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo James doesn't see it like that, though. "That place is my icebox," he 
said recently, sitting at home in his Tlingit Indian village of Hoonah, 30 
miles to the south. "It's always been our supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
James and other Tlingits, who have populated the region for 9,000 years, say 
the bay is part of their traditional fishing grounds. They claim the right to 
enter the park and set salmon nets. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Park Service disputes the natives. Because Indians have not 
used the bay much in recent decades, they have forfeited claims of continuous 
subsistence, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The park service has been telling local residents that they may not fish in the 
park, and a spokesman said the government will issue regulations soon to make 
such fishing specifically illegal. However, authorities have acknowledged that 
enforcement has been deliberately lax out of consideration for native 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the issue is the fact that non-native commercial fishermen have 
been taking salmon in the bay regularly for years. The state of Alaska issues 
commercial permits for the region. 
</P>
<P>
This fishing, too, is technically illegal. But the park service is considering 
a seven-year study of fish and the bay. And, during this time, commercial 
fishing, although not Indian subsistence fishing, will be allowed to continue, 
according to the park service. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that commercial fishermen have been continuously using the 
bay, but subsistence fishermen have not. And we're not going to add a new 
consumptive use while we study the effect of fishing on the park," a spokesman 
said.

ARAB VERSION OF MACHISMO PLAYS ELUSIVE ROLE IN MIDEAST SHOWDOWN;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all the ships, tanks, planes and troops have been placed in the balance 
in the Persian Gulf crisis, Arab analysts add still another factor -- the 
intangible quality of "face." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Saddam Hussein, President Bush, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi 
Arabia's King Fahd, PLO leader Yasser Arafat -- all have all been weighed on 
the scale of Arab public opinion in the last four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important now is that the Americans not lose face," one exiled Kuwaiti 
professor said. "If they weaken in this confrontation, the (Arab) people will 
turn against them." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak suggested in a television interview that face is particularly important 
to President Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"To withdraw from Kuwait . . . I think he would meet terrible problems if he 
did that now," Mubarak said. "That's why he's very obstinate. Overall, he has 
lost credibility all over this part of the world. I can't say that he's 
finished, but his curve has gone down sharply." 
</P>
<P>
In the Arab world, the notion of face is rooted in the ancient traditions of 
Bedouin honor and the need to protect the family or tribe. Every harm is 
repaid, particularly insults, which Arabs say "can only be washed away with 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
In the Far East, wisdom is held in the highest esteem; in the Middle East, 
strength is the paramount virtue. Some historians argue that machismo was born 
in these deserts, delivered to Spain in the Arab conquests and transferred to 
Latin America by the Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Although Western attitudes of rationality have pervaded the region, 
particularly among the upper classes, strength is still the dominant measure of 
face. Weakness is deplored. If a friend is bowed with illness, an Arab man will 
rarely console him with an arm around the shoulder. He will stretch his hand 
before his friend's eyes and make a fist: Be strong. 
</P>
<P>
These are days of testing for the Iraqi president. He denies that his Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait was dishonorable, arguing that he was only taking back what 
belonged to his tribe, the Iraqis. But the Kuwaitis, Saudis and Egyptians 
accuse him of breaking a vow not to invade. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has challenged King Fahd's esteem for allowing Western troops -- 
nonbelievers -- on soil that shelters Islam's holiest shrines, Mecca and 
Medina. He argues that the troops are threatening the tenuous concept of the 
Arab nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis and most other Arab countries point out that it was Hussein's 
invasion that drew the Westerners into the region and that Hussein has put his 
own people in danger. This, they say, is not the mark of a leader. 
</P>
<P>
All these points have been measured by Arab opinion, and Hussein's stock has 
declined. But he still has supporters -- in Jordan and North Africa, and in the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, which esteemed him highly earlier this year 
when he threatened to use chemical weapons against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Using foreigners trapped in Kuwait and Iraq as hostages against attack has cost 
him heavily in the West. Besieging the diplomats still in Kuwait city has also 
hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything happens to them," Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has 
said, "it will be the responsibility of a dictator who seized another country 
by force." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi strongman has turned to variations on cunning that have 
backfired among ordinary Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is preposterous; he has no shame," an exiled Kuwaiti woman exclaimed last 
week as she read a hotel news-ticker account of Hussein playing patron to a 
group of Britons held in Baghdad, offering to have his Ministry of Education 
look after one child's school needs and patting another on the head. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Arab honor in hypocrisy, and the balance shifted sharply against 
him after the incident with the children. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest test of face -- of strength, in Arab terms -- for Hussein and the 
other principals in the confrontation will come in the weeks ahead, presuming 
the gulf region does not erupt in war. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see him backing down," said the Kuwaiti professor, a psychologist. 
"He's a mix of different characters: extremely intelligent, stubborn, greedy, 
hyper. But his vision is narrow. . . . The problem with Saddam is that he 
doesn't mind everything burning down, even if he's the only one to survive. 
They say he's been reading history a lot. Probably Nero."

Imelda Marcos, wife of former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, asked 
an anti-graft court Monday to dismiss lawsuits filed against her by the 
government of President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos's lawyer in Manila, Sergio Apostol, filed a motion stating that the 
former first lady has immunity because she was following the orders of her 
husband during his 20-year rule over the country. 
</P>
<P>
The court has already declared Imelda Marcos in default in more than 30 civil 
cases filed by the government after she refused to present legal papers in her 
defense. The government is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars from the 
Marcoses for allegedly looting the national Treasury.

Imelda Marcos was acquitted by a New York court July 2 of fraud and

The race: Attorney general. Whose ad? Republican Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second spot scores Democratic candidate Arlo Smith, the district 
attorney in San Francisco, for allowing businessman Donald E. Werby to plead 
guilty to four misdemeanors after being indicted on 22 felony drug, sex and 
bribery counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the Lungren ad, with an analysis by Times staff writer Paul 
Feldman: 
</P>
<P>
 Ad: "A grand jury indicted reputed billionaire Donald Werby for sexually 
molesting 13-year-old girls, providing crack cocaine to kids and attempted 
bribery." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Grand jury testimony accused Werby of picking up teen-age prostitutes 
in downtown San Francisco and taking them to his home, where the offenses were 
said to have taken place. Werby was also charged with trying to bribe one of 
the teen-agers who testified against him. As for Werby's financial condition, 
he insists he is merely a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "But San Francisco D.A. Arlo Smith allowed Werby to plea bargain. No jail, 
just some community service and a fine." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: In a negotiated plea bargain approved last month, Werby pleaded 
guilty to misdemeanor counts of statutory rape and contributing to the 
delinquency of minors. In exchange for the plea, involving girls 15 to 17 years 
of age, a Municipal judge ordered 18 other counts dismissed and sentenced Werby 
to three years of probation. The judge also ordered Werby to undergo 
psychiatric counseling, perform nine months of community service and pay a 
$300,000 fine to a program aimed at aiding homeless youths. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the plea bargain was the best disposition of the case due to 
problems with evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "This, after Werby and his brother had given thousands to Smith's political 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Werby, his brother, Robert, and their firms donated $7,500 to Smith's 
campaign for attorney general in early 1989. The Smith campaign eventually 
returned those contributions.

<P>
Twenty-eight-year-old Nasir Hirmiz was supposed to be back at work Monday at an 
irrigation equipment manufacturer in El Cajon after having taken a few weeks 
off to visit his parents in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
That he didn't show up was the least of the concerns among his co-workers. The 
big news was that, earlier that day, he had escaped from Iraq with another San 
Diegan, Lee Jacob, who was visiting his parents in Baghdad as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We were worried about Jim (as Hirmiz is known to his friends) because we 
hadn't heard from him. We hadn't even gotten a postcard," said Donna Aiken, the 
personnel director at Hardie Irrigation in El Cajon where Hirmiz has worked for 
the last three years. "We've missed him. We want him back. He's a character. 
He's a lot of fun to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Both Hirmiz and Jacob, who are Iraqi-born Americans, drove into the dusty 
Jordanian border post of Ruweished from Iraq on Monday, leading a contingent of 
30 or more Americans who were fleeing Iraq, a U.S. diplomat told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The details of their escape -- and the circumstances that allowed them to cross 
the border while thousands of other Westerners are still held by Iraq -- 
remained unclear Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had spent several weeks at their parents' Baghdad apartments, 
hiding out in fear that they would be detained by Iraqi authorities if found. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terrified," Hirmiz told Reuters after crossing the border into Jordan. 
"We were staying at our parents' homes when the U.S. Embassy called, saying we 
could leave within the next two weeks. We left the first day we could because 
we thought the Iraqis might change their minds." 
</P>

Jacob, a computer programmer, told Reuters: "We just want to go home, very, 
very bad. I couldn't believe how unlucky I was to go to Iraq for a holiday at 
such a time. It frightened me the way they (Iraqis) were going on against the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just innocent civilians," he said. "But I must say no one came to 
bother me, perhaps because I was at home all the time. I lost 15 pounds."

<P>
Jacob said the U.S. consul in Baghdad had told him to stay off the streets 
because on two occasions Arab-looking American passport-holders had been picked 
up and conscripted. 
</P>
<P>
He said he went Sunday to an Iraqi government office to receive his exit permit 
-- and saw about 500 other Americans there trying to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the two Americans had safely arrived in Jordan.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL ON TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR FALSIFIED POLICE REPORTS OKD 
</P>

Police officers who file false reports would face increased penalties under 
legislation, sparked by a highly publicized Long Beach incident, that the 
Senate sent to Gov. George Deukmejian's desk. 
</P>
<P>
A 39-0 vote was cast on the bill (SB 2681), sponsored by Sen. Daniel Boatwright 
(D-Concord). Earlier hearings focused on the case of a white Long Beach police 
officer who misrepresented a confrontation with a black police critic that 
occurred during a routine traffic stop. The officer currently is awaiting trial 
on a misdemeanor charge of falsifying a report. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make the future filing of a false report either a misdemeanor or 
a felony, depending on the seriousness of the case.

THEATER: ATHOL FUGARD'S 'MY CHILDREN! MY AFRICA!' SHOWS SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL 
CONFLICT THROUGH DEBATING STUDENTS.

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athol Fugard has sometimes been referred to as the Samuel Beckett of South 
Africa -- not, heaven knows, because he is sparing with words. Quite the 
reverse. Rather because, like the late Irish playwright, he understands, in 
some deep visceral part of his conflicted self, the tragedy of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
He did not have to look far. The stage was set for him from birth: A white man 
born in a predominantly black country, where the caldron of racial repression 
was about to boil over; a white man, moreover, outraged by injustice and torn 
by his helplessness in the face of its daily manifestations. 
</P>
<P>
With this set of givens, it was inevitable, perhaps, that Fugard, who gave us 
such early jolts as "The Blood Knot," "Boesman and Lena," " 'Master Harold' . . 
. and the Boys" would, sooner or later, write a play like "My Children! My 
Africa!," which opened Sunday at the La Jolla Playhouse. Later more likely than 
sooner, because it is a work of emotional complexity and philosophical argument 
that could only have erupted from a playwright at a certain stage of maturity 
in both his life and work. 
</P>
<P>
The plot takes two bright high school students from opposite ends of the South 
African spectrum with, in common, intelligence and a taste for scholarship. 
Thami (Sterling Macer Jr.) is a black boy from the impoverished "location" 
(township), and Isabel (Nancy Travis) is a well-to-do white girl from the 
better part of this small eastern Cape Karroo town. They are brought together 
in a debate by Thami's dedicated black teacher, Mr. M (Brock Peters). 
</P>
<P>
The success of this brief encounter across the great racial divide emboldens 
Mr. M to team these two students in another contest -- this time, on the same 
side of the argument. It's a daring idea that excites the inspired old man and 
the eager Isabel but generates inarticulate resistance in Thami. 
</P>
<P>
Fugard, who also directed his play, has set this up so that we begin to see 
these children not only as the division of South Africa itself but as the two 
halves of the teacher's tortured soul: the African in him who yearns for parity 
and freedom -- and the scholar in him who reveres the essentially white legacy 
of education, believing passionately in its power. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing the stone somebody tossed through the schoolhouse window in one hand 
and a dictionary in the other, Mr. M makes an ardent case for the dictionary, 
imploring Thami to seize the penetrating force of the word over the blunted 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
But Thami and his fellow students are not listening. Their patience has run 
out. These are young men who see the pleading Mr. M as a superannuated 
so-called "white black," whose ideas won't wash any more. The conflict between 
man and boys -- embodied in this one boy -- precipitates disaster, while 
Isabel, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy awash with tears, tries to make 
sense of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Extraordinarily, she does. The torrent of words that has gushed and spewed 
before, some of it simply as too many words (this is a very verbal play) but 
most of it with tremendous eloquence, is a preamble to a stunning close. 
</P>
<P>
The impotent Isabel and alienated Thami sort out their contradictory emotions 
in a confrontation that neither oversimplifies the issues nor backs away from 
the abundant sorrow and complexity of its resolution. It puts Fugard in first 
rank as a playwright. 
</P>
<P>
He is supported here by three superb performances. Peters is at once a man in 
ruins and pillar of tragedy as the upstanding teacher who cannot overcome the 
turning tide, showing us both aspects of Mr. M: the morality and anachronism of 
his deeply felt beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Macer gives Thami the strength, seriousness and sweetness of a boy caught in a 
maelstrom and struggling with an illogical world. And Nancy Travis exemplifies 
the rage and sadness of enlightenment stumped by the senselessness of violence. 
All three, sooner or later, burn a hole in one's consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Parichy's lights provide a moody scheme, but, in every other respect, 
simplicity wisely rules Fugard's production. Douglas Stein and Susan Hilferty 
have designed a basic platform severed by a curtain that the actors pull at 
will. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, it's all about the writing. In "My Children! My Africa!" 
Fugard achieves what every dramatist aspires to, a profoundly regionalized 
vision that illuminates the universal. 
</P>

KIDBEAT: FESTIVALS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children don't have to be left out of this year's arts festivals -- music, art, 
theater, dance, storytelling and puppetry geared for all ages make the arts a 
family attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Many Los Angeles Festival events promise to be child-pleasers, offering 
discounted tickets for those under age 12. Among the ticketed events: A 40-foot 
tall marionette is part of the Bread and Puppet Theater's production of 
"Uprising of the Beast," a play about the environment that takes place in a 
cavernous airplane hangar at the Santa Monica Air Center on Sept. 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
"Puppets and Dragons" can be found at the L.A. County Arboretum in Arcadia on 
Sept. 4 and 11 at 8 p.m., with Java's Wayang Kulit shadow puppet play, and on 
Sept. 7 at UCLA's Sunset Canyon Amphitheatre with the Shadow Play Theater 
Company and the puppets of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the Sunset Amphitheatre are "Native Dance of North America," Sept. 4; 
"Ancient Dance of Oceania," Sept. 6; "Make a Joyous Noise" with the Johnson 
Gospel Choir, Faithful Central Missionary Choir and St. Brigid's Catholic 
Church Youth Choir, Sept. 8; and on Sept. 9, the music of "Andean Winds" with 
Huayucaltia. 
</P>
<P>
If the family budget won't stretch another nickel, free events are offered in 
abundance. Dance, music, puppetry and pageantry for all ages can be found 
during the Opening festivities Saturday through Monday at Angels Gate and Point 
Fermin Parks in San Pedro and at the African Marketplace in Rancho Cienega Park 
and on Sunday at Olvera Street and Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups scheduled to perform free at Griffith Park on the old zoo 
grounds Sept. 8-9, from noon on, are the Bread and Puppet Theatre; Huayucaltia, 
the Woomera Mornington Island Culture Team dancers and the Zenshuji Zendeko 
drummers. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 8, the Children of Bali will bring dance, music and games to Plaza de 
la Raza, while the Zenshuji Zendeko taiko drummers perform at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Head for sunny Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 15-16 and watch the Gujo 
Hachiman-style of bonodori dancing. On Sept. 15 only, on the steps of City 
Hall, La Banda Sinoloense Mazatlan and Ecos de Chiapas la Familia Cruz 
celebrate the Mexican holiday El Grito with music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Festival wrap-up on Sept. 15-16 at beautiful Descanso Gardens, 
offers international musicians and dancers in outdoor settings. One small entry 
fee admits you and your family. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Open Festival events target young audiences directly and are either 
free or very modestly priced. A sampling: Imaginative costumes highlight a 
retelling of "The Fisherman and the Koi" at the Long Beach Community 
Playhouse's Studio Theatre on Saturday. An adaptation of a classic Japanese 
fable, the 30-minute show will be followed by short acting workshops. Before 
the performance, the Children's Theatre Ensemble cast makes young audience 
members feel comfortable with the theater experience by putting on costumes and 
applying makeup onstage. 
</P>
<P>
Theaterworks with an environmental theme are popular. On Sept. 8, the audience 
participatory "World Within Worlds" will be held at the Enchanted Forest 
Theater in Woodland Hills, and at Coldwater Canyon Park in Beverly Hills, 
TreePeople Family Theater's "TR*A*S*H, a comedy of "epidemic proportions" takes 
place. The evening includes music, refreshments and special guests and is 
preceded by "Family Day at TreePeople," an afternoon of puppetry, arts and 
crafts, tours and tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
"Gift Rap," originally a South Coast Repertory Educational Touring production, 
plays Sept. 15-16 at the Encino Community Center. The musical fantasy about 
kids who find more than they bargain for at the shopping mall, is directed by 
one of the original actors, Peter Ellenstein, and will use South Coast 
Repertory's sets and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Even adults can get in a "tell me a story" mood with professional storytellers 
who spin tales of humor and high drama. On Sept. 16, three veteran 
spellbinders, Milbre Burch, Angela Lloyd and David Novak -- known as the Triple 
Crown Tellers -- will perform "Voices at the Water's Edge -- Tales from the 
Pacific Rim" at 1 and 3 p.m. at Occidental College, for adults and school-age 
children. The stories, with music, include folk tales from New Zealand, Alaska, 
Taiwan, India and from the Hispanic culture. 
</P>
<P>
Puppetry is popular in the Open Festival too. "The Jerry Dinosaur Show" and 
"Canine Capers" with the humorous Wonderworld Puppets, will take place at the 
Torrance Community Theatre on Sept. 8 and 15; the Sierra Puppet Theater, 
bringing Native American legends to life in "Coyote Tales," performs at the 
Santa Monica Public Library on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Why just sit and watch? Children and parents can get creative at a number of 
venues, including the Westside Arts Center on the Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 
15, where the public can create free "Fish Art": an underwater mural, fish 
prints, masks and more. 
</P>
<P>
For a higher ticket price, there's the sheer spectacle and "ooh-ah" feeling of 
the Shanghai Acrobats and the Imperial Warriors of the Peking Opera. They will 
go through their amazing paces at Warner Grand Theatre on Sept. 11 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
For information on these and other L.A. Festival and Open Festival events, call 
(213) 688-ARTS.

CRITIC AT LARGE: LIGHT OF LIBERTY IN ANOTHER TIME OF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early last Sunday morning, with a bright sun burning off the last of a ground 
haze, our cruise ship sailed past the Statue of Liberty on our way into New 
York harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, not all the stills, newsreels, television documentaries, not the 
finale of Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur," entirely prepares you for the size of 
the statue. Even seen across half a mile of open water, she is enormous, a 
stunning green goddess beckoning to us and seeming to glow as the sunlight 
catches her. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of us crowded the railings and sufficient film was being shot to 
provide extra dividends at Kodak and Fuji. It was a perfect hour to catch sight 
of the statue. There was the warm, clear promise of the day and, despite all, 
the promise of a new life that the statue has stood for all these years. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that the passage produced a mix of emotions -- a tangle of 
emotions is probably more like it -- in all of us. My own feelings were touched 
not least by the memory of my first sailing into the harbor past the lady with 
the torch. 
</P>
<P>
That had been 45 years ago on an April morning in 1945. I didn't get to see the 
statue on that voyage. I was in a bunk deep below decks on the Queen Elizabeth, 
which had been fitted out as a hospital ship. The captain's resonant British 
voice on the intercom had told us where we were. So last Sunday morning was a 
pleasure long delayed. 
</P>
<P>
A little later on that earlier April morning the captain came on the intercom 
again, this time to say, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to tell you 
that your President, Franklin Roosevelt, died this morning at Warm Springs, 
Georgia." There was, I remember, a long silence and then a voice that I would 
have placed in Brooklyn said, "Harry Truman." I'd been so immersed in being an 
infantry private I don't think I could have said who the vice president was. 
</P>
<P>
So that 1945 morning had had its own mix of emotions, the relief at getting 
home from the war in one only temporarily damaged piece, the uncertainties of a 
war not yet over, the dismay at losing a leader I had worshiped (whatever some 
of the Upstate elders I knew thought of him). 
</P>
<P>
The arrival and the docking last Sunday morning was in another time of crisis, 
and it had been more unsettling than comforting to have spent the days largely 
beyond the reach of daily newspapers and the more frequent fixes of radio and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
World War II had been radio's finest news hours, and the voices of Elmer Davis, 
William L. Shirer, Edward R. Murrow, even peppery H. V. Kaltenborn and other 
less celebrated readers and correspondents, echo in memory. Yet it was a kind 
of revelation at sea to appreciate how accustomed we have all become to the 
instantaneous visual information from television and the amazing feats of both 
immediacy and depth that the newspapers now achieve. 
</P>
<P>
On an earlier port stop I'd telephoned a journalist friend in Washington. I 
said it had given me a sense of unreality to feel so detached from events. If 
you have a sense of unreality, my waggish friend said, you belong in the higher 
reaches of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
If we had lost hourly contact with the breaking news in the Middle East, we had 
been in touch with the longer reaches of American history during port stops. 
There had been earlier sail-bys of Ft. Sumter, where the Civil War began, and 
Ft. McHenry, whose bombardment inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The 
Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday I had walked the historic precincts of Philadelphia, pausing at the 
grave of Benjamin Franklin in Christ Church burying ground, where several 
signers of the Declaration of Independence take their rest. It is a shady oasis 
where the weathers have eroded the inscriptions from most of the stones and the 
living world seems farther away than it is. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the old brick walls, indeed, there are the carriage rides and the tour 
buses, the hoagie vendors and the fretful small fry tugging at skirts and 
demanding to go. Yet for all of it -- and maybe, at that, because of the 
throngs -- the old buildings are somehow more than political mausoleums. You 
still sense the ghostly presences of those philosopher-activists, contentious 
among themselves as they often were, who codified our dreams of individual 
freedom, tolerance and self-determination, and who set us on our way. 
</P>
<P>
What they would make of our day I'm not sure. I suspect that only Thomas 
Jefferson and Ben Franklin himself, inventors both, would not be amazed by all 
the technological wizardries we take for granted. They might, on the other 
hand, be made melancholy to contemplate the priority that material things have 
taken over the abstract notion of liberty they held so dear. 
</P>
<P>
Wandering through the Friends Meeting House where the life of William Penn, 
that devout believer in nonviolence, is celebrated, and where a loving 
simplicity is the desideratum, it was possible to feel just such a melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
After all the courage and the sacrifices in war by generations of brave men and 
women, there are, as Stephen Vincent Benet said in a fine poem, "still the 
tyrants and the kings." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back across the four-plus decades to my first sail past the Statue of 
Liberty, I couldn't help thinking -- again and gratefully -- what a clear-cut 
war I'd been in. No amount of revisionist thinking can explain away the clear 
and present danger that the Axis powers represented to the ideas of tolerance, 
individual dignity and freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
In the mix of emotions Sunday morning was a strong dose of "Here we go again." 
Liberty is still at risk from tyranny; the detailings may differ, but the root 
scenario is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there have been recent times when the world as a whole has seemed to learn 
from all its bloodyings and its butcherings. Such hope as you could find on a 
bright Sunday was that a whole context of lessons had been learned, one being 
that tyranny is unacceptable, another being that collective firmness works 
better than appeasement (a lesson from 1776 as well as 1939). 
</P>
<P>
One way and another, it seemed curiously timely to have strolled through the 
American past in Philadelphia, to have saluted that glorious statue in the 
harbor and to have been reminded that the country, uniquely, was born of ideals 
of personal freedom that are relevant now as ever.

"PrimeTime Live" was sure-fire with Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer -- the Jack 
Nicholson and Meryl Streep of TV news. 
</P>
<P>
But Sam and Diane mixed like oil and water. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, we hadn't even heard of "The Simpsons," "Twin Peaks" and "America's 
Funniest Home Videos" -- all late network starters. 
</P>
<P>
But Madison Avenue whizzes figure they still know where the smart money goes. 
Media buyer Paul Schulman offers a few bets on this season: 
</P>
<P>
Like almost everyone, he's sold on "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," with rapper Will 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Money in the bank," says Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest People" will also score, he adds -- because it follows 
"America's Funniest Home Videos." 
</P>
<P>
And "Gabriel's Fire," with James Earl Jones as an investigator, could do 
respectably against "Cheers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Flops? Schulman has little hope for "The Flash" (based on the comic strip), 
"Life-stories" (dramas about medical patients) and "Sons and Daughters" (about 
a Northwest family). 
</P>
<P>
Possible sleeper, says Schulman: "WIOU," about a local TV news operation. 
</P>
<P>
HIT AND MISS: Easy to understand why "Knots Landing" is back for its 12th year 
-- best soaper on TV. But an eighth season for "Night Court"? Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
AT EASE: Can't tell you how much we missed Todd Donoho's KABC Channel 7 sports 
trivia questions during our vacation. We almost rushed back. But a few weeks 
away from Arsenio Hall is rejuvenating. 
</P>
<P>
CLOTHES HORSE: Best reason for watching the 11 p.m. newscasts in Los Angeles is 
Fred Roggin's first-class wardrobe. If the KNBC Channel 4 sports guy picks out 
the stuff himself, he's definitely worth the $800,000 or so he reportedly gets 
per year. Right? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER HOURS: Let's be generous and not even discuss Rick Dees' late-night ABC 
series. 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SEARCH: The endless turnover of CBS News presidents -- with David 
Burke the latest to go -- is disgraceful and demeaning to an organization that 
once was the jewel of network journalism. The place is beginning to come across 
like a palace of medieval intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
STIRRINGS: With Deborah Norville's negative publicity beginning to subside, or 
at least become old news, NBC's "Today" show has quietly picked up a trifle in 
the ratings over the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
TOURISTS: Forget "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" Thursday -- competitor "48 
Hours" sounds like it's got some ideal summer viewing: an hour visit to the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
PEER PRESSURE: Fox TV has broken another barrier in its fight for parity with 
ABC, CBS and NBC. For the first time, Fox will be represented when executives 
of the major networks address the Hollywood Radio and Television Society's 
annual kickoff luncheon for the new season Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE MOVE: Linda Alvarez and John Beard were the anchors on KNBC's late news 
the other night, but reporter Patrick Healy registered more authority. 
</P>
<P>
BLUEPRINT: Since news shows usually draw older viewers, reruns of "The Golden 
Girls" should be an ideal 7:30 p.m. lead-in to KCAL Channel 9's three-hour 
prime-time newscasts when the station launches its fall season Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
CANDIDATES: Two clergymen who sought the presidency and failed are staying in 
the public eye with TV series this fall. "The Jesse Jackson Show," a new, 
issue-oriented, syndicated program with the Democrat, will debut on KCAL Sept. 
24 as a 5 p.m. Sunday entry. And Republican Pat Robertson is, of course, seen 
on "The 700 Club" on the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF A KIND: Roseanne Barr once dropped in on his cable show because she 
likes him. A lot of performers do. And on Sept. 9, waiter-comedian Mr. Pete, a 
loony, sardonic performer, moves up in class to KTLA Channel 5 with an 11:30 
p.m. Sunday debut. It's called "The Late Mr. Pete Show." And the comedian 
describes it as "the 'Tonight Show' gone bad." 
</P>
<P>
HOME STRETCH: Voting on Emmy Awards nominations was held Saturday and Sunday at 
the Beverly Hilton, and here's how it works: More than 1,500 panelists judge 
their peers in 76 separate panels -- that is, performers judge performers, 
writers judge writers, and so forth. Fox airs the Emmy Awards show Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
POTENTIAL: With some really good writing, stars Jean Stapleton and Whoopi 
Goldberg could turn CBS' "Bagdad Cafe" into one of the best shows on TV. 
There's something very nice about the way they work together, but without great 
words to sustain the fragile premise of friendship in a remote diner, forget 
it. 
</P>
<P>
SHOWCASE: If you never really looked at "Beauty and the Beast," which won a 
host of Emmy nominations but was canceled by CBS, you have another chance when 
the Family Channel reruns the series starting Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "The first requisite of culture is good manners." Who said it? 
Charles Laughton in his impressive role as a teacher in the World War II film 
"This Land Is Mine," shown on the American Movie Classics channel.

CASTRO URGES QUEST FOR END TO THREAT OF WAR IN MIDEAST

Cuban President Fidel Castro on Monday urged the world to seek a peaceful 
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis, saying that war there would leave a legacy 
of hunger in poor countries that would kill millions. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Havana opening a U.N. Congress on Crime Prevention, Castro said 
war between Iraq and the West would destroy "incalculable" lives and resources. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, by driving up oil prices to more than double their previous value, 
such a conflict would have a fatal impact on oil-importing Third World 
countries already burdened by unpayable foreign debts and hamstrung by an 
unequal world trading system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The duty of the international community to find a nonviolent solution to the 
conflict has to do not just with the sacred principle of peace but also with 
the lives of tens of millions of human beings who could die as a result of 
hunger," the Cuban leader said. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent criticism of both Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the response of 
the United States and its allies in sending military forces to the gulf, Castro 
condemned what he called "manifestations of arbitrary behavior and criminal 
violence in international conduct."

The chute had caught on the plane's door, opened and was sucked outside. "He

HIS EGO HURT, SEAU SHOWS UP;

CHARGERS: AFTER MUCH THOUGHT AND A LONG WALK, THE FIRST-ROUND DRAFT CHOICE 
SIGNED HIS CONTRACT AND BEGAN WORKOUTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
After a morning of stalled talks and secret walks Monday, Junior Seau swallowed 
his pride and made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The signing of Seau, a linebacker out of Oceanside High and USC, wasn't a 
surprise. That the process closely resembled the Theater of the Absurd was. 
Seau appeared to have ended what was a 34-day holdout Aug. 23, when he and 
agent Steve Feldman reached an agreement with Charger General Manager Bobby 
Beathard that would give Seau a five-year contract worth approximately $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was that Seau wouldn't play in Saturday's exhibition against 
the 49ers -- won 29-28 by the Chargers -- but would report to camp Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine the stir created when Seau was a no-show. He explained it was a 
simple case of missing three airline flights from Cancun, Mexico, where he was 
"soaking up the sun and relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
He also did some heavy thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole day yesterday I was trying to think of why I should renege, why I 
should just back out of this contract," Seau said. "I didn't come up with 
enough positive notes to do so. So I'm here. Mom and Dad are going to have a 
house, and I'm happy I'm working for Bobby Beathard and (Alex) Spanos, and I'm 
looking forward to helping out the team, to contribute, and be ready for a good 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all his thinking, he still had second thoughts. Beathard and Seau met 
briefly before Feldman joined them, and when Beathard asked Seau if he was 
ready to sign, Seau and Feldman took an hourlong stroll on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a walk," Seau said. "(Feldman's) my partner, and I wanted to make 
sure everything was going good for the both of us if we did sign. It's not the 
best, but we were ready to deal." 
</P>
<P>
Seau maintained that all along, it was his decision to sign, not Feldman's. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big misconception," Seau said. "Steve doesn't talk me into anything. 
He brings it out and I decide. Steve was not holding out, Junior Seau held out 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt the contract was forced on him, he said: "Shoved down the 
throat? No, but from the other end maybe. . . . It was something you felt like 
you had to do, it was done and I'm here. Bobby Beathard did a great job for his 
people and Steve did a great job for me." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said that while they didn't actually ask for more money, they met with 
Beathard in an attempt "to convey to this club that the contract being offered 
to Junior Seau was below market value," he said. "It was an effort to indicate 
that the figure of the contract can't be an exact science." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he thought the bottom line was always money, but both sides 
conceded that egos were a stumbling block as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just an issue of money," he said. "But I think anytime you have 
an issue of money, both sides feel so differently about what it should be, and 
I think feelings were hurt. I think egos were bruised. Things happen like that, 
there's an emotional side to it besides just the money, and when things get 
emotional, people are going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Said Seau: "It's not a loss. You know what it is? It's ego. You know that thing 
called ego? Yeah, it hurts. But you go on and have to swallow some. You have to 
swallow some to get some, and that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
But why the change in heart over the weekend when terms were agreed upon 
Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
"To get mentally prepared," said Seau, who flew his mother to American Samoa to 
be with his seriously ill grandmother. "I had some problems with grandma. I'm 
frustrated that the press used grandma as an excuse for me to stay out and try 
to buy some time from Bobby Beathard. It was nothing like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give up football for my family. It's a sport I love and enjoy. I would 
play football for a dollar if you were paying everyone else a dollar. But 
you're not. The market's up, and I went for it and I lost." 
</P>
<P>
Said Feldman: "Bobby Beathard saw a man that didn't want to sit out the season 
and he made his play." 
</P>
<P>
But how hard will the adjustment be for Seau, who has missed 37 days with the 
team? 
</P>
<P>
"After two sacks I'll be ready," said Seau. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith said the adjustment won't be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll do fine," Smith said. "He'll do a great job. He's intelligent. I think 
he has a real burning desire to excel." 
</P>
<P>
Seau said he will do his best to put the past behind him and get "down and 
dirty" about the business of football. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (Beathard) to make sure you can't pay me to lose," Seau said. "Junior 
Seau is not one to say, ok, I didn't get my way, I'm going to pout, I'm not 
going to go out there and help us lose. That just doesn't work with me. You 
can't pay me to lose and you never will." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he had no reason to believe that Seau would begin his shortened 
season with any harboring ill feelings or holding a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad this is behind us," Beathard said. "We're happy to have him here, and 
there's no indication that he wouldn't give us his best." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seven down, seven to go. The Chargers released cornerback Ken Berry, tight ends 
Dave Colonna and Tommie Stowers, defensive ends Derick Debnam and Mike Estes, 
linebacker Patrick Moore and nose tackle Doc Wise on Monday, bringing their 
roster to 67. The club still must trim the roster to an NFL-sanctioned 60 by 
today's 1 p.m. deadline. . . . Five players were placed on injured reserve: 
guards Chris Goetz (elbow) and Mike Simmonds (knee), cornerback David Poole 
(hamstring), wide receiver Wayne Walker (knee) and linebacker Ken Woodard 
(elbow, knee). . . . Offensive tackle Leo Goeas, the Chargers third-round draft 
pick, practiced for the first time Monday since injuring his foot the first 
hour of training camp.

ROBERTS STEALS THE SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: HE HAS FOUR HITS, A STOLEN BASE AND A SPECTACULAR CATCH IN A 4-1 
VICTORY OVER MONTREAL.

<P>
Bip Roberts heard the whispers during the winter, knowing there were skeptics 
lurking everywhere he turned, and critics waiting to mug him at the moment of 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter that he batted .301, scored runs at a higher rate than 
anyone in the league, and was the catalyst of the Padre offense a year ago as 
their leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts knew what everyone was thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought I was a fluke," Roberts said Monday. "Nobody believed in me. I 
don't know if they thought I was joke, or what." 
</P>
<P>
Well, well, look who's laughing now. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mr. Roberts himself Monday night stealing the show in the Padres' 4-1 
victory over the Montreal Expos, stunning a crowd of 13,403 at Olympic Stadium 
who must have wondered how this little fella could sneak through customs and 
invoke such damage. 
</P>
<P>
At the plate: Roberts went four for five, with a double and RBI, obtaining the 
fourth four-hit game of his career. In the four-game series against the Expos, 
he batted .529 (nine for 17) with three doubles, one homer and three RBIs. He 
has raised his batting average to .301, its highest point since June 6. 
</P>
<P>
On the basepaths: Roberts stole his career-high 32nd base (and his third of the 
series) in the seventh inning. He has just seven fewer stolen bases than the 
combined total of the Padre's Monday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
In the field: Playing his third different position in four games, left field, 
Roberts threw out Tim Wallach at second base in the sixth inning and made the 
game-saving catch in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Expo first baseman Mike Aldrete walked over to him and said, "Man, 
you've got everything working tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts could only smile, thinking about all those days during the past winter 
where he worked out with teammate Tony Gwynn, getting stronger and stronger, 
and taking batting practice so often that the callouses on his hand turned into 
blisters. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to prove I'm no fluke," Roberts said. "I know people were saying 
a lot of things. People were even saying back in '87 after I got sent down (to 
the minors) that I'd never be back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I'm the total complete player, but I think I've proven a lot of 
people wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "You know, he talked about that all winter. Every day he worked 
out, he had that on his mind. He said he had something to prove, and he's 
proving it." 
</P>
<P>
Said shortstop Garry Templeton: "Hey, the man can play. Hell, I always thought 
he could play. I don't hear anyone talking now." 
</P>
<P>
While Roberts was the feature event in the Padres' attack, his supporting cast 
wasn't too shabby, either, with every player in the lineup reaching base at 
least once. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring just six runs in the previous four games combined, Padre Manager 
Greg Riddoch said it was time for drastic measures, and after going through a 
hotel notepad of experimental lineups, he finally settled on one that was a bit 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Tony Gwynn, who was being benched for the first time in his 
career. Catcher Benito Santiago was batting third for the first time since 
1988. Fred Lynn was playing right field for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Padres had six players in the lineup who were batting .250 or 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
So it figures, right, that the Padres not only break out of their slump, but 
they even displayed rare power, hitting two homers in a game for the first time 
since July 28? Joe Carter homered in the fourth inning, ending his nine-game 
drought without an RBI, and Templeton put the game out of reach with his 
two-run homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The result proved to be quite satisfying to Riddoch, who knew that he not only 
was leaving himself wide-open to second-guessing about his lineup, but that he 
had irritated Gwynn, his four-time batting champion. 
</P>
<P>
When Gwynn, who leads the team with a .315 batting average, was asked before 
the game when he last sat out of a game without an injury, he said: "Never, and 
it's not going to be happening today, either." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn promptly went out on the field before batting practice, summoned Riddoch, 
and they went back inside the clubhouse and had a 10-minute closed-door 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He was as mad as a bee in a hornet's nest," Riddoch said, "but I wasn't 
changing my mind. I wanted to rest him." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one look at the statistic sheet revealed just why Riddoch made the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, the four-time batting champion, happens to be hitting .182 in his career 
against Expo starter Oil Can Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, who had spent his 15 years in the American League, owns a .316 career 
batting average against Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Lynn went hitless in three plate appearances against Boyd 
and didn't obtain a hit until the eighth inning off reliever Scott Ruskin, but 
all was forgotten by the time Roberts caught Andres Galarraga's line drive for 
the final out. 
</P>
<P>
Padre starter Ed Whitson (11-7) won his fourth consecutive decision, but the 
only difference this time was that he needed a little help. 
</P>
<P>
Just one out away from obtaining his sixth complete game, Whitson gave up a 
two-out single to Aldrete and issued a walk to Mike Fitzgerald -- his first in 
20 innings -- to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson departed, and in came bullpen stopper Craig Lefferts. To the plate came 
pinch-hitter Galarraga, who just so happens to have two hits in nine at-bats 
against Lefferts, both home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The first pitch was in the dirt. The second pitch was a screwball, and 
Galarraga slammed it into left field. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was in the gap for sure," Whitson said. "But then I saw Bip 
coming on, and then I said thanks for having him on my team." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, running at full speed, caught the ball as it was slicing away from 
him, saving what appeared to be a double that was going to score at least two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, with the way that ball was going," Roberts said, "it was a lucky catch 
more thananything. It was in the lights, and it was dropping. I wasn't sure it 
hit my glove until I looked inside." 
</P>
<P>
The save was Lefferts' 22nd of the season, and the man who was being asked to 
step in the Cy Young shoes of Mark Davis, has allowed just one run in his past 
22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of satisfaction in what I've done," Lefferts said. "I believed 
in myself that I could do it, and to me that confidence is the most important 
thing you have. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I had that bad 10-day stretch there (blowing three consecutive 
save opportunities) when I went into a tailspin at the same time as the team. 
If I don't got into that tailspin, maybe they don't go into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's going to haunt me the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who has missed the past six games with a 
strained right hamstring, was available Monday night for pinch-hitting duties. 
Clark possibly will miss the rest of the trip, Manager Greg Riddoch said, to 
make sure his hamstring is fully recovered. "I don't want to play the 
90-percent game again," Riddoch said. "He wasn't totally healthy when we 
brought him back last time, and look what happened." Clark injured his 
hamstring Aug. 9 and missed six starts before returning. Four games later, he 
sustained the same injury. . . . Garry Templeton's home run in the seventh 
inning was his first since July 6. He now is just one home run shy of his 
career-high of nine, set in 1979. "He threw me one changeup too many," 
Templeton said of his homer off Oil Can Boyd. . . . Fred Lynn's single in the 
eighth inning ended his one-for-21 (.048) slump. . . . Padre 23-year-old 
starter Andy Benes on Ed Whitson: "He's embarrassing the rest of us, is what 
he's doing." . . . Padre chairman Tom Werner will meet the team today in New 
York, his first road game outside Los Angeles since purchasing the club June 
15. . . . The Padres provided the Expos with their most-lopsided defeat since 
Aug. 4. . . . The Expo bullpen has yielded just five earned runs over their 
past 51 2/3 innings for a 0.87 ERA. . . . Expo outfielder Otis Nixon has 41 
steals this season in only 165 at-bats. The all-time major league record for 
fewest at-bats in a season with 50 or more stolen bases is held by Miguel 
Dilone of the 1978 Oakland Athletics. He stole 50 bases in 258 at-bats.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: LAWRENCE FIGURES IN 6 TDS; MORSE WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teddy Lawrence, a Times' All-County selection last year, led Morse High to a 
55-15 victory late Saturday night at Hawaii's Aloha Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, the Tiger's senior quarterback, rushed for 214 yards and three 
touchdowns and passed for 109 yards and three touchdowns as Morse routed 
Hawaii's Punahou High. 
</P>
<P>
He was named the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy was able to get outside of them pretty well, and then just took off," 
Morse Coach John Shacklett said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence scored on runs of 65, 42 and 67 yards. The 65-yarder came on Morse's 
first play from scrimmage, an option. His scoring passes were 65 and 36 yards 
to Tommy Bennett and 11 yards to running back Gary Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor added 209 yards rushing and fullback Conan Smith 97 as Morse totaled 536 
rushing yards. Morse led, 38-0, at halftime and, 45-0, before Punahou managed 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a quadruple header, Lincoln High also experienced a rout Saturday 
night in Aloha Stadium, but the Hornets were the ones being routed, losing, 
47-13, to Hawaii's St. Louis High. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis, which has the nation's second longest winning streak (55 games 
dating back to 1985), scored its first two touchdowns without having run a play 
from scrimmage. St. Louis returned a punt 95 yards for the game's opening 
touchdown and returned a kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown after a Lincoln 
touchdown made it 7-6 in the first quarter. St. Louis later increased its lead 
to 40-6 just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln managed just 83 yards rushing and 73 passing, and had only one first 
down in the first half.

OIL FIRMS WISHING TO EXPAND OUTPUT FACE BALKY LENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the surge in oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, there is no 
gusher of money available to finance expanded U.S. oil exploration and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
That means that even if continuing Mideast hostilities revive interest in 
domestic oil production, getting money to finance it could be a major hurdle. 
The prospect of tight money worries experts who believe that it will take 
substantial amounts of credit to rebuild an oil industry infrastructure 
devastated by the energy recession of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who wants to drill has to hire a guy with crews and equipment. It's 
the guys who have the crews and equipment who are strapped for capital. They 
have no place to go at all," said Matthew Simmons, who heads a Houston 
investment banking firm that raises money for oil service companies. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a legacy of the 1980s. Banks and investors, buoyed by optimistic 
forecasts 10 years ago that crude prices would be as high as $100 a barrel by 
this year, turned on a tap of money to wildcatters and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
But prices fell through the floor. Once burned, lenders and investors are now 
reluctant to relive the nightmare of collapsing oil prices, insolvent borrowers 
and repossessed oil rigs. 
</P>
<P>
"They are infinitely more cautious than they were 10 or 15 years ago," 
investment banker Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Events Monday showed dramatically how volatile oil prices are. Prices for the 
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, which soared to about $31 a barrel 
late last week, plunged $4 as fears eased about a Mideast war and oil-producing 
countries considered raising output. 
</P>
<P>
Bank credit is tight anyway. In particular, banks are not aggressively trying 
to make energy loans as they once did, because of the risks. Indeed, energy 
lending is so tarnished that one Southland institution, City National Bank in 
Beverly Hills, runs radio ads boasting that it does not make energy loans. 
</P>
<P>
Energy lenders as a group also are more conservative, if for no other reason 
than that the freewheeling lenders who bankrolled projects in the early 1980s 
are out of business, the most notorious being Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who weren't cautious in energy lending in the 1970s and 1980s 
aren't in banking anymore. The institutions that survived had more conservative 
management," said Stephen Brown, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Also, doctors, celebrities and other investors with no specialized knowledge of 
energy can no longer throw money at tax shelters tied to drilling ventures. 
Changes in federal law virtually wiped out those tax breaks, some of which were 
so generous that investors often didn't much care whether oil was ever found. 
</P>
<P>
Even as tensions in the Middle East grow, views toward financing ventures have 
yet to change much. For one thing, no one is convinced that higher oil prices 
-- $27 Monday, compared to $16 at the start of the summer -- are for real. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably at least a $6-a-barrel premium compared to what prices would 
be if we didn't have the Iraq-Kuwait issue. If there is some resolution to the 
situation, you'll see that 6 bucks evaporate overnight," said Chase Manhattan 
Bank Senior Vice President Robert Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
Banks generally will make so-called production loans, those secured by proven 
oil and gas reserves. But they won't touch some energy loans, such as those to 
finance purchase of drilling rigs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making rig loans. We have a rule not to do it," said Gary Wright, 
manager of energy and chemicals for Chemical Bank in Houston. Funding for oil 
exploration ventures usually does not come from banks but from investors who 
gamble on earning a share of potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
Big Oil is largely unaffected by current lending policies. To raise money, 
major oil companies do what many large industrial firms do: sell commercial 
paper, which is a corporate IOU. The largest oil service firms have been 
selling stock to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller, independent oil producers and service companies have felt the crunch 
most. Robert Sterling, vice president of exploration and development for Nahama 
&amp; Weagant Energy Co. in Bakersfield, said the firm has been discussing a 
possible $10-million credit line with lenders. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found them to be extremely cautious," he said. "And we don't think this 
run-up in prices will cause them to change their long-term plans." 
</P>
<P>
Although the loose-money days of the 1980s are gone, lenders had been showing 
signs of making more money available for energy projects in the months leading 
up to the Mideast crisis. Some attribute this to rising prices during the past 
year and increasing confidence that they are heading up over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Atkins, executive vice president of the energy group for NCNB Texas in 
Dallas, said the bank's energy loan portfolio was $3 billion June 30, up 25% 
from the start of the year. Likewise, the energy portfolio for banking 
competitor First City in Houston was $951 million June 30, nearly double the 
year-earlier level. 
</P>
<P>
But banks overall have clearly reduced their activity in energy lending from 
the levels of a few years ago. Alfred F. Grove Jr., Bank of America senior vice 
president for energy worldwide, said the San Francisco bank's portfolio of 
energy loans and credit lines totals $8 billion, down from $11.4 billion in 
1985. Part of that reduction Grove attributes to the banking firm's 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns many experts is that it will take substantial amounts of money to 
revive the industry from its near-moribund condition. The number of oil rigs 
working in the United States -- a key indicator of activity -- is about 1,000. 
Although up from a year ago, the number is less than one-fourth the peak number 
of 4,500 rigs active in 1981. Substantial money will be needed to refurbish 
idle rigs, hire workers and crank up operations. 
</P>
<P>
Lenders and oil executives all said big money will be made available for energy 
loans only after people are convinced that higher oil prices are here to stay. 
But with the lessons of the 1980s, they add, it will be a long time before 
anyone truly believes it.

T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.49%, down from 7.55% last week. Another $9.2 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.48%, 
up from 7.45% last week. 
</P>
<P>
The rates were the lowest for three-month bills since they sold for 7.41% on 
Aug. 13. It was the highest for six-month bills since they averaged 7.52% on 
July 16. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors: 
7.74% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,810.70, and 
7.88% for a six-month bill selling for $9,621.80. The discount rate reflects 
the price discount received when government securities are purchased at less 
than face value.

HOME SALES IN JULY AT SLOWEST PACE IN 4 1/2 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: PRICES OF EXISTING HOUSES IN THE STATE ALSO FELL FOR THE FOURTH 
STRAIGHT MONTH. THE MEDIAN IS NOW $194,099.

<P>
The residential real estate market in California continued to cool in July as 
sales of existing houses fell to their lowest level in 4 1/2 years, an industry 
trade group reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices also fell, in a continuation of a trend that began four months 
ago. The median price of a resale house in California is now $194,099, or 3.7% 
less than in July, 1989, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The price dip is particularly troublesome for those who bought houses at the 
peak of the market in 1989 and face large losses if they have to sell in 
today's softening market. 
</P>
<P>
The California housing market peaked in the first half of last year and has 
generally declined since. The slide accelerated in recent months, marked by the 
first year-to-year declines in housing prices since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
As soft as the housing market has become, it "is probably going to get worse 
over the next six months," said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real 
Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. 
Economists blame uncertainty over the Middle East situation, which has placed a 
cloud over the entire U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
According to the realtors association, the pace of housing resales statewide 
fell to an annual rate of 419,943 in July, off 15% from a year ago and 5.3% 
from June of this year. The sales figures reflect how many homes would be sold 
in 1990 if the July pace continued all year. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of housing resales has not been this slow since December, 1985, 
according to Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the realtors 
association. 
</P>
<P>
The national picture was slightly better. Home sales rose 3.3% nationwide to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units in July following a 0.9% 
gain in June. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a severe recession, the California housing market should remain weak 
for another 18 months before it begins to recover, Rosen said. About 450,00 
single-family houses will be sold in California in 1990, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
However, if a severe recession occurs, it will send the residential real estate 
market into a tailspin not seen since the dark days of the early 1980s, when 
home prices in California fell as much as 10% on a year-to-year basis, Rosen 
said. The market hit bottom in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that the overall value of single-family detached homes 
in greater Los Angeles has dropped 4.5% since July, 1989. The median price of a 
house sold in the Los Angeles area last month was $215,533, compared to 
$225,616 in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, house prices have risen slightly in Orange County and dropped 
slightly in the San Diego area, compared to year-ago levels. The median house 
price last month was $245,798 in Orange County and $186,182 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Appleton-Young pointed out that the growing coolness in the housing 
market has come at a time when the outlook for buyers is far more favorable 
than a year ago. The supply of houses is up, prices are down and mortgage rates 
have been stable, she said, but picky buyers are holding back. 
</P>
<P>
Although the housing market is in an undeniable fall, most real estate 
economists say there is no reason for alarm -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
Tough times will not come until the pace of housing resales falls below 350,000 
annually, about where it was in 1981, according to Michael S. Salkin, manager 
of real-estate risk assessment for First Interstate Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're nowhere near a catastrophic level yet," Salkin said.

Fidelity Federal Buys Two Thrifts: Citadel Holding Corp. in Glendale said its 
subsidiary, Fidelity Federal Bank, acquired from the Resolution Trust Corp. the 
deposits and some assets of two troubled thrifts, including Los Angeles-based 
Westwood S&amp;L, whose failure is being probed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Federal acquired about $350 million of Westwood's deposits and $220 
million in deposits of Investment Federal S&amp;L, which was based in 
Chatsworth. The RTC said that after the sale and the disposition of the 
thrift's remaining assets, bailing out Westwood will cost the taxpayer-funded 
agency $259.5 million. Investment Federal's bailout will cost the RTC $10.4 
million.

AMERICAN SUES OVER UNITED'S FLIGHT CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The battle for control of the skies over Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
shifted to federal court Monday, as American Airlines sued archrival United 
Airlines over changes in United's October flight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, American contends that United has assigned new departure times to 
about 140 flights from Chicago, in violation of federal rules. American said 
many of the rescheduled United flights would depart several minutes before 
American flights, giving United what American considers to be an unfair 
competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a United flight to Boston from O'Hare has been rescheduled to 
leave at 7:45 p.m., 25 minutes before an American flight at 8:10 p.m. 
Currently, the United flight leaves at the same time as the American flight, 
American spokesman Tom Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
United said American's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Ft. Worth, is 
without basis. 
</P>
<P>
United said that it has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to approve 
its new departure schedule and that the FAA is expected to make a decision 
Friday. United changed its schedule in anticipation of the FAA's decision, said 
Lawrence M. Nagin, senior vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA controls departures at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, and three 
other heavily used airports in an effort to reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the FAA is the appropriate forum to address airspace 
management issues at O'Hare, not federal court in Ft. Worth," said Nagin. 
American is based at Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Nagin said United was forced to shift many flight times in response to changes 
that American made in its upcoming flight schedule. American's changes "put all 
flights for all carriers together at the same time, causing congestion and 
delays," Nagin said. 
</P>
<P>
Any delay would likely hurt United more than American, because Chicago-based 
United is the largest airline at O'Hare, with more than 400 departures daily.

Whittaker Spinoff? Whittaker Corp. said it is exploring the idea of spinning 
off its bioproducts division to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles company, which in recent years has divested all but its 
aerospace and biotech units, said its decision would depend in part on 
financing. The company also announced results for its third fiscal quarter 
ended July 31, which saw income from continuing operations rise to $4,025,000, 
or 47 cents a share, versus a loss of $3,213,000 a year earlier. Whittaker 
stock rose 75 cents to $10.50.

JAPAN BECOMES NO. 1 IN MANUFACTURING SALES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE REVELATION RAISES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF AMERICA'S

Add another No. 1 to the list for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The nation that outstripped the United States to become the world's leading 
creditor and leading aid donor is now also the world's leading manufacturer in 
terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although the American gross national product is still nearly 1.9 times larger 
than Japan's, sales by Japan's manufacturing firms in 1988 surpassed sales of 
all manufacturing firms in the United States for the first time. Japan's 
statistics for 1989 won't be available until December. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 score card read $2.783 trillion for Japan to $2.612 trillion for the 
United States, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census and Japan's Economic 
Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently no government official in either nation has commented publicly about 
the development, and most appear to be unaware of it. But coming on the heels 
of growing qualitative competition from Japan in high technology and concern 
about the competitiveness of American industry, Japan's unheralded quantitative 
clout in manufacturing raises serious new questions for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Takashi Sakuma of the Economic Planning Agency's research division said sales 
of Japan's manufacturing corporations amounted to 357 trillion yen in fiscal 
1988. At the average 1988 exchange rate of 128.26 yen to the dollar, that 
equaled about $2.8 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. figure of roughly $2.6 trillion was provided by the Current Business 
Analysis division in the Bureau of the Census in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Both figures were given in response to queries from The Times. Neither agency 
has made any announcement comparing the two countries' manufacturing sales. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last year for which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development issued figures for both countries in one report, the United States 
held a slight edge over Japan, $2,390 billion to $2,352.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sakuma noted that the sales compilation is somewhat misleading, because it 
includes an undetermined amount of double accounting. Goods that Japanese or 
American manufacturing firms procure from suppliers are counted once as sales 
of the supplier and again as part of the final manufacturer's sales, Sakuma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Counting only the "value-added" portion of manufacturing, the United States 
remains ahead of Japan -- at least in 1987, the most recent year for which 
comparable statistics are available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese manufacturers, Sakuma said, tend to rely upon outside suppliers for 
parts more than U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's OECD National Accounts report showed that in 1987 "value-added" 
manufacturing in the United States was worth $862.3 billion, compared to $689.3 
billion in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Even without statistical knowledge of Japan's quantitative gains in 
manufacturing, executives on both sides of the Pacific have expressed concern 
about the future of American manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Nobuyuki Nakahara, president of Tonen Corp., an oil-refining company affiliated 
with Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., recently predicted that "differences between 
the United States and Japan will grow further in terms of investment, stocks, 
and productivity -- all in favor of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The strong American service industry "is a buffer to (the United States') 
economic difficulties. Therefore, it is hard to define the course of the future 
for the U.S. economy. But I think the American economy faces a very difficult 
future," Nakahara said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Japan overtaking the United States in manufacturing sales, Earl 
Harbeson, president of Monsanto Co., said during a recent visit here that "we 
have spent 10 years moving toward a service economy. Obviously, we have a 
manufacturing decline." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole consumer electronics industry has been removed from American 
ownership and has never been replaced by other manufacturing. It concerns me a 
great deal that American manufacturing presence is on the decline relative to 
other countries, particularly in long-term investments in manufacturing 
assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harbeson blamed the decline on the "system" in the United States that "puts a 
very high premium on short-term results" and "takes it out of the hide of your 
stocks if you don't produce." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take the leadership of Congress and the President" to turn the 
tide, he said. "Many people are worried about the future of American 
manufacturing, but it's not addressed." 
</P>
<P>
"Graduates of American business schools don't want to go into manufacturing . . 
. and engineering schools in the United States are filled largely with foreign 
students. . . . We are not raising people educated in engineering." 
</P>
<P>
Sakuma said the main reason manufacturing has remained strong in Japan is that 
businessmen here "expect a future decline in their competitiveness in producing 
a certain product and include the cost of developing a next-generation product 
in calculations of current manufacturing costs." As a result, when production 
of radios became uncompetitive, Japanese electronics manufacturers began 
television production, then moved on to videocassettes and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Factories don't close; rather, they produce new products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, when American manufacturers move production overseas, the domestic 
plants often don't put out a new product; they are merely closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the dollar started losing its value in 1985, Sakuma noted, many American 
manufacturing industries have regained competitiveness. He cited steel and 
chemicals as examples. But in consumer products, "production doesn't come back 
(to the United States) from overseas factories, even if exchange rates return 
to appropriate levels." 
</P>
<P>
A white paper on the Japanese economy issued by the Economic Planning Agency 
said technological development has enabled Japan to maintain a strong 
manufacturing base, despite a 67% gain in the value of the yen since 1985. The 
yen appreciation should have made exporting more difficult for Japanese 
manufacturers.

BIDDERS LINE UP FOR MERCURY S&amp;L SALE

Federal regulators are preparing to sell Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn., and 
sources said Monday that at least four potential bidders are reviewing the 
books of the $2-billion institution. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the suitors include Security Pacific National Bank of Los 
Angeles, Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly Hills, American Savings Bank 
of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal Savings Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Scalzi, western regional director of the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
federal agency overseeing the sale of goverment-run S&amp;Ls, would not 
identify the potential bidders but said several major California banks and 
S&amp;Ls are actively considering purchasing Mercury. "We hope to have a deal 
done before the end of September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With its 24 branches and loyal customer base, Mercury would make a good 
addition to many major institutions' networks of offices, said financial 
institutions consultant Edward Carpenter.

RECORD FINE ASKED FOR FUNDAMERICA FOUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Florida's attorney general on Monday proposed to fine FundAmerica founder 
Robert T. Edwards $20.4 million, the largest penalty that office has issued 
against an individual, for allegedly violating state law by operating a pyramid 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who faces criminal and civil charges relating to the operations of 
Irvine-based FundAmerica Inc., allegedly violated the state's Unfair and 
Deceptive Trade Practices Act, according to Joe Bizzaro, spokesman for Atty. 
Gen. Bob Butterworth. 
</P>
<P>
He said Florida investigators suspect Edwards of hiding millions of dollars in 
foreign bank accounts, some of which they claim was stolen from investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the highest fine assessed against an individual in 
Florida," Bizzaro said. "We certainly don't think he should profit from any 
illegal activity here in Florida." Several states, including California, claim 
that FundAmerica is a well-disguised pyramid scheme that relies on the sale of 
memberships for its revenue. But company officials say it is a legitimate 
consumer club, obtaining discounts for its members on such services as 
long-distance phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, 
after the filing of a $150-million class-action lawsuit that froze the 
company's assets and banned it from doing business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The company announced a restructuring of its sales program on Monday and said 
it is negotiating with regulators in two states so it can begin doing business 
again. The company refused to disclose the name of either state. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica and Edwards have denied the charges against them, including 
organized fraud activity and running an illegal lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards could not be reached for comment Monday, but his attorney said he was 
shocked by the Florida fine. 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of the fine is clearly premature and imprudent and improper," 
said Neal Sonnett. "Mr. Edwards is a legitimate, honest businessman. He has not 
broken any laws." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is scheduled to appear in Florida Circuit Court in Orlando on Wednesday 
for a review of his $1-million bail. The Florida Statewide Prosecutor's Office 
is asking for a higher bail because it is concerned that he might try to flee 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnett said Edwards will be in court Wednesday, which will mark his first 
public appearance since he was arrested July 19. He is living in a rented home 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is wanted in London on pyramid scheme charges there and has gotten in 
trouble with authorities in Canada and Australia as well. 
</P>
<P>
"These innuendoes about him being a fugitive or nobody knowing where he is are 
absurd," Sonnett said. "I will be there by Mr. Edwards' side and we intend to 
ask the judge to lower the bail, something we would not have done except for 
this outrageous motion." 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth, the Florida attorney general, already had fined FundAmerica $8.2 
million, which the company is asking an appeals court to review. The company is 
also challenging the state's cease-and-desist order in the Circuit Court in 
Dade County.

APPRAISER PLEADS GUILTY IN CONSOLIDATED SAVINGS FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A real estate appraiser for defunct Consolidated Savings Bank of Irvine pleaded 
guilty Monday in federal court to charges of conspiring to mislead the 
institution and failing to file income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Wolfe, 61, of Glendale, pleaded guilty to conspiring to prepare a phony 
appraisal of a home for Consolidated so the thrift's books could disguise a 
crooked $500,000 real estate loan to unnamed straw borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Straw borrowers, who act as middlemen in obtaining loans to hide the identity 
of true borrowers, helped facilitate many S&amp;L frauds, federal prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory D. Schetina said that, as part of the Consolidated 
conspiracy, Wolfe misrepresented the value of a Laguna Beach home as $850,000 
by saying that it was a custom-built oceanfront house, when he knew that it was 
several miles from the beach and worth only about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe allegedly funneled the extra money to Pyrotronics, an Anaheim-based 
fireworks company that was owned by Orange County businessman W. Patrick 
Moriarty. Moriarty served 29 months in prison after being convicted of charges 
related to political corruption. Consolidated's owner, Robert A. Ferrante, has 
been called a close business associate of Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe also pleaded guilty to four counts of failing to file income tax returns 
from 1983 through 1986, Schetina said. The appraiser had been charged with 
seven misdemeanor counts of failing to file.

MAKING TRACKS: But some like to ride the rails, even if they don't like to be 
taxed for it. . . . Ridership on Orange County's new commuter trains along I-5 
between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles has soared 20% since May to 337 a 
day. Still, that's far short of the trains' 1,200-seat round-trip capacity, so 
monthly fares, already 20% below Amtrak rates, will fall another 10%. Also, a 
direct mail marketing effort is in the works. Jeffrey A. Perlman and Steve

PIECES OF PUZZLE FELL TOGETHER IN TRIPLE EXECUTION

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legal journey that could lead Greg Sturm to the gas chamber started with a 
tip that was ominous in its overtones: The 20-year-old man borrowed a .38 
Special from a friend and, just hours after three of his former co-workers were 
found shot to death in an auto parts store last week, returned it -- fired and 
wiped clean. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators moved quickly. From there, according to an 89-page police report 
that gives intricate details of one of Tustin's worst killings, the pieces 
seemed to fit together. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness descriptions of a man at the store just before the killings appeared 
to match Sturm. A fingerprint from Sturm was found at the scene. An alibi about 
a Mel Gibson movie was contradicted by the suspect's girlfriend. And Sturm's 
own statement to police was described by them as "incriminating." 
</P>
<P>
"Based on all the evidence," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said Monday, 
"we think we have our man." 
</P>
<P>
Sturm is due to be arraigned Sept. 7 in Santa Ana on three counts of murder, 
plus additional charges of robbery and burglary. In the meantime, he is being 
held in Orange County Jail, accused of a crime that his own lawyer says appears 
at face value to be as confused as it was brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender William G. Kelley said Monday that he has not yet seen 
police reports on the case or the "incriminating statements" that police say 
Sturm made around the time of his arrest last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But pointing to police claims that Sturm robbed a store where he was easily 
recognized by former co-workers, Kelley said: "If this is true, it was a very 
unsophisticated crime." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe that Sturm never intended to let the witnesses to 
his robbery live to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear robbery-homicide," Rosenblum said in an interview. "Sturm 
didn't want to leave any witnesses, so he executed them." 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the Aug. 19 robbery at the Super Shops store were employees Chad 
Chadwick, 22, of Orange; Darrell Esgar, 22, of Huntington Beach, and Russel B. 
Williams, 21, of Seal Beach. Each was bound and shot in the head at close 
range. The assailant also took about $1,100 from a safe. 
</P>
<P>
Described by a manager as a "hothead" and a cocaine addict, Sturm had worked 
with all three victims until early August, when he was fired on suspicion of 
theft, tardiness, and other work problems, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
But by his own admission, he was back on the day of the killings, according to 
the police report. 
</P>
<P>
Sturm told investigators that he stopped by the store around 5:30 p.m. that day 
and talked briefly with Esgar, then went to see a Mel Gibson movie with his 
live-in girlfriend, an assertion that she would later unwittingly contradict 
when questioned by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Police didn't have to look far to talk with Sturm the day after the murders: He 
returned to the scene with another Super Shop employee who wanted to "say a 
prayer for the victims," according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
Sturm was released after being brought into the police station for an 
interview, but the police report indicates that evidence quickly began to mount 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Working on a tip from John Orr, a police reserve officer, Tustin investigators 
talked to a Super Shops salesman who said he had loaned a roommate's Taurus 
.38-caliber revolver to Sturm on the day of the killings and had gotten it back 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the salesman, Rick LaBare, one of two employees to discover 
the bodies, told them that the gun was clean when he loaned it to Sturm. LaBare 
said that he hadn't cleaned the gun since he got it back and that it was now 
dirty as though it had been fired. However, there were no fingerprints on the 
gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Department lab tests later concluded that the 
.38-caliber slugs recovered from the victims were fired from the borrowed gun, 
the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
LaBare said in an interview that Sturm told him that he wanted to borrow the 
gun for target practice. He said he considered Sturm a friend. "That's what 
makes this even worse, thinking he could do something like this," LaBare said. 
</P>
<P>
In a search last Wednesday of the Tustin apartment that Sturm shared with his 
girlfriend, Renee Dusseau, police recovered a yellow, blood-stained Super Shops 
shirt. They also seized a large batch of coins that investigators believe was 
among the rolled-up coins that the assailant took from the store, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Dusseau told investigators that she last spoke to Sturm by phone on Wednesday, 
informing him that police wanted to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Sturm fled to a friend's house in Riverside and 
was discovered Thursday morning by Dusseau's father, sleeping in the back yard. 
He was questioned by investigators and later booked on suspicion of murder, 
robbery and burglary.

SUPERINTENDENT OF CAPISTRANO SCHOOLS DENIES COVER-UP

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District on Monday denied 
charges of a conspiracy to cover up use of district funds in a special election 
campaign last year and challenged the district attorney's office to bring the 
matter to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Jerome R. Thornsley said the district provided "a wealth of information" 
to prosecutors detailing its involvement in the campaign for Measure A, a 1989 
ballot initiative, including opinions from the district's lawyers and the 
Orange County Department of Education allowing the district to promote the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley questioned why charges in the case have not been filed despite the 
yearlong probe. 
</P>
<P>
"They (prosecutors) have the attitude, and I don't know whether it's 
politically motivated or not, that you're guilty from Day One and we're going 
to find the evidence," Thornsley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We bent over backwards to give them all of the material during the first year 
(of the investigation). If they felt we were violating the law, fine. Let them 
take action, and we'll defend our position." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, who is conducting the investigation, was 
not available for comment. He is investigating charges that the district 
misused public funds in approving a secret "bonus incentive plan" for school 
principals who brought out the necessary two-thirds vote needed to pass Measure 
A, which would have raised property taxes for new school construction in the 
district. The measure failed at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley acknowledged that principals who "worked hard on the election" were 
considered for bonuses, but denied that bringing in "yes" votes was a 
prerequisite for extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the D.A. extensively about that," Thornsley said. "One of the 
things we made clear (to principals) was that they were not to advocate a yes 
vote. We thought we could reward anyone who worked hard on any issue. Where in 
the law does it say that you can't give merit pay for a particular issue?" 
</P>
<P>
But Thornsley did not dispute prosecutors' charges that he tried to keep the 
incentive plan secret. He said he feared that public knowledge of possible 
bonuses would "contaminate" the election and that opponents of the measure 
"would make that the whole issue of the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes from the school board's closed sessions revealed Thornsley's 
recommendation to cancel the bonuses "should the incentive pay issue become 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Those minutes also noted that the Board of Trustees voted "unanimously to 
authorize the superintendent to recommend (principals) for incentive stipends 
during 1989 as a result of (them) achieving 66 2/3 yes votes in their areas." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Grob, a Sacramento attorney representing the district, said that the 
Board of Trustees only authorized Thornsley to tell principals that the board 
might consider campaign work among other criteria used during bonus and salary 
review and that district records do not indicate that bonuses were paid based 
on yes votes within a principal's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"To the best of my recollection, Thornsley said that they reviewed people for 
their salary increases, and in some cases (campaign work) may have been a 
factor they discussed," Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley said the district's actions were based on legal opinions from the 
Sacramento law firm of Kronich, Moskovitz, Tiedemann &amp; Girard, and from 
Ronald Wenkart, a senior attorney for the county Department of Education. The 
Sacramento firm advised the district that the state Education Code "allows the 
school district to expend public funds for special elections," but Thornsley 
said Wenkart advised him against using district funds to advance the district's 
position, Thornsley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the position that we were going to follow (Wenkart's) opinion, that we 
would promote the election, but we would assiduously avoid advocating a yes 
vote," Thornsley said. He added that all brochures prepared by the district 
were forwarded to Wenkart for review. Wenkart was not available for comment.

PRESERVATION: A WOMEN'S CLUB LAUNCHES ADOPT-A-TREE PROGRAM TO PREVENT OAKS AT 
TRABUCO CANYON FROM BEING CUT TO MAKE WAY FOR NEW HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Until Lorlaine Davis and her friends in the Trabuco Women's Club heard that a 
proposed widening of Live Oak Canyon Road would mean the destruction of 
centuries-old oak trees, they never imagined themselves taking part in an act 
of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
The women's club is not one that traditionally involves itself in political 
issues. But when plans for the road's widening were announced, the women knew 
that it meant more than just the razing of a few trees. They were convinced 
that an entire lifestyle in rustic Trabuco Canyon, one of Orange County's last 
rural areas, was at stake here, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined that if they actually came to take down the oaks, I would 
chain myself to one," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
She decided that if others in the community "adopted" their own trees, they 
might feel the same way. And, at Davis' suggestion, the Trabuco Women's Club 
agreed to launch an adopt-an-oak program to save the trees from bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
No one has had to face off any bulldozers or become involved in any other 
public act of defiance. But it is apparent that the movement to save the canyon 
has spread. Along a four-mile stretch of the road, dozens of white banners hang 
on the mighty oak tree trunks. On each banner is the name of another activist 
who has joined the battle to save the oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"People are actually willing to stand in front of their tree if it comes down 
to that," said Susie Wiberg, president of the Trabuco Women's Club. "It sounds 
'60-ish, but that is the kind of militancy that's raised when you try to mess 
with the canyon's rural character." 
</P>
<P>
The future of Live Oak Canyon Road has been at the center of a debate involving 
how many new homes should be built in a 6,500-acre unincorporated area east of 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the county's development plan for the area, called the 
Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan, recommends the construction of 2,200 new homes 
in the canyon, said Ray Chandos, a Trabuco Canyon homeowner and chairman of an 
advisory panel of residents and landowners reviewing options for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the county's land-planning department did not return telephone 
calls about the plan. But Planning Commission Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck, who 
represents the Trabuco area on the commission, said there was general agreement 
among commission members and county officials that the oaks will not be 
bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
"No decision has been made on the latest plan yet, but the key thing is that 
people can be assured that the oaks are no longer threatened," said Nordeck, a 
Trabuco Canyon restaurant owner. 
</P>
<P>
But the members of the Trabuco Canyon Women's Club are not so sure. The 25 
members meet regularly to paint the names of "foster parents" on banners. For a 
donation -- there is no set amount, but some have been as high as $100 -- 
supporters not only get a banner with their names, but also a certificate of 
recognition. Each foster parent is then given the responsibility of protecting 
one of the oaks that form a natural canopy along the route. 
</P>
<P>
The movement to save the trees has spread beyond the banners. Third-graders in 
Sue Boyd's class at the Trabuco School have devoted weekend days to writing and 
mailing letters urging elected officials in the county to help. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the school, the Emory General Store sells buttons and 
T-shirts inscribed with "Save-The-Canyon" pleas. Store owner Linda Emory said 
sales of the buttons and T-shirts have been good. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Canyon residents still wake up to the crowing of roosters, and horses 
are as common as cars. With its sparse population of about 500, the community 
is one where folks know most of their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need curbs, traffic lights and tract homes," Wiberg said. "We've had 
enough of Rancho Santa Margarita and Portola Hills-type development. People 
here are fighting to keep their chances of communing with nature and their 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
But for at least one family, enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Moreton moved to the canyon from Northern California with her husband and 
two children eight years ago. They settled in to raise chickens and kept a 
horse for their two young children. On Monday, Moreton, who has been active in 
the campaign to save the canyon, was busy packing to move her family back to 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do like the canyon and have caring and feelings for it, and it's not 
too late to stop the developers from moving in," Moreton said. "But we're being 
swallowed up. The area is overbuilt, too crowded and too smoggy. We've had too 
much of it."

FIVE WOUNDED IN SHOOTING AT SANTA ANA BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unknown man armed with a semiautomatic handgun sprayed a neighborhood pub 
with bullets early Monday, wounding five patrons, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said the five men were inside the 
Red Baron Bar, a small, narrow saloon in the 1800 block of South Main Street, 
when a gunman carrying a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun reportedly flung 
open the front door just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"He just stuck his hand inside the door and started shooting randomly at the 
patrons inside," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have no suspects yet, she said, and they are puzzled as to a 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't appear to be robbery or anything like that," Thomas said. "We are 
trying to determine whether he had been in the bar earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The bar, which was purchased May 1 by Bok Sun Song and sells only beer and 
wine, was crowded at the time of the shooting, and five or six employees were 
working, said Song's brother-in-law, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
All of the victims are expected to recover, although at least three were 
seriously wounded, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven M. Sayles, 38, of Colton was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
where he underwent surgery for a bullet wound to his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Guardado, 25, and Francisco Munoz, 29, both of Santa Ana, were taken to 
UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Guardado was reported in serious condition with two gunshot wounds to his 
stomach, Tardiff said. Munoz was listed in fair condition, she said, also 
suffering from a bullet wound, but she did not know where he had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
Fillimon Covarubias, 21, of Santa Ana was taken to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he was admitted with a bullet wound to 
his stomach, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Gasho said. He was listed in serious 
but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ruvio, 42, of Santa Ana was also wounded, but police said they were unable 
to determine where he was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
The state Alcohol Beverage Control Department has no record of recent trouble 
at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
City and police records for the last few years show only an arrest for assault 
with a deadly weapon at the location several years ago, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The establishment remained closed on Monday while employees cleaned up and 
straightened out the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get some semblance of order around here so we can open tomorrow," 
the owner's brother-in-law said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that employees could offer little information to police because the 
armed assailant -- by remaining outside the establishment when he fired and 
then fleeing the scene -- did not allow anyone to see his face. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know anything more than the police know right now," the man said. 
"They are not really able to say much to anybody."

CANDIDATE CHIDED ON 'ILLEGAL' BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Barry Williams said Monday that the city should cut off 
utility service to a downtown office used by former City Administrator Paul 
Cook because the building does not have the necessary city permits. 
</P>
<P>
The building, a former residence at 306 3rd St. and once used as a doctor's 
office, is shared by Cook and Jonathan Chodos, the proposed developer for the 
city's Pierside Village project. Cook is a candidate for one of the four City 
Council seats to be filled in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
City officials on Monday said the structure has not been issued a 
conditional-use permit and certificate of occupancy necessary for use as a 
business building. But they said the landlord, California Resorts, has applied 
for such permits. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Cook and Chodos should be removed from the building until the 
permit situation is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"This means they're using that building illegally and they're violating city 
laws," said Williams. "It's particularly bad to see someone who's running for 
the City Council, and who must swear to uphold the laws of the city, to be 
violating the laws even before elected." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is now a private consultant, said Monday that the landlord is seeking 
the necessary permits and that he has fulfilled his responsibility by obtaining 
a business license. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chodos said he was unaware that the building lacked necessary 
permits when he moved in. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the responsibility of the landlord," Chodos said. 
</P>
<P>
Chodos hopes to build two or more new restaurants on the ocean side of Pacific 
Coast Highway at Main Street, a project known as Pierside Village. The project 
has drawn intense opposition from some environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Cook has been criticized by some in the environmental groups for "being allied 
with Chodos." 
</P>
<P>
But Cook said Monday that he is only sharing a building with Chodos and has no 
business connection to him or anyone else in downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my business is outside of Huntington Beach," Cook said. BILL BILLITER

INFORMATION ASKED ON SHOOTING VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is seeking information about the shooting death of a 
man whose body was found alongside a major thoroughfare near Brea city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Manuel Duarte, 49, whose last known address was in La Habra, was 
found at 6:45 a.m. on Saturday off Brea Boulevard in an unincorporated area 
about half a mile from the city line, Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, Olson said. "It would 
appear to us that he was killed someplace else and then dumped there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was also known as Ramiro Mendez Vargas and Manuel Llanes. Olson declined 
to say why Duarte would use aliases, but he said that Duarte had worked in the 
construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
Olson is asking anyone with information about Duarte's death to call the 
Sheriff's Department at (714) 647-7000.

CITY TO DECIDE ON PROPERTY TAX LEVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners in Anaheim will be levied an annual tax of about one-half 
percent per $100 cash value of their property this fiscal year if the City 
Council approves the increase at its meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the tax will be effective immediately and payments will be due with 
regular property taxes in November and April. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the tax is necessary to repay interest and payments on a 
$10-million bond that the city took out in 1986 to make storm drain 
improvements. The bond issue was approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners are taxed annually to service the debt at a decreasing rate, 
said Ron Rothschild, administrative services director. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim property owners would pay the increased tax for the next 15 years until 
the debt is repaid, if the City Council approves the ordinance.

COUNTY TO CREATE NEW WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What it takes Mother Nature hundreds of years to create with wind and rain, 
Orange County parks employees will attempt to do in three years using 
bulldozers and artificial irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Grading work that began this summer on the east side of William R. Mason 
Regional Park and a temporary irrigation system scheduled for installation next 
month are intended to help create 80 acres of artificial wetlands. They will be 
across Culver Drive from the more manicured section of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Besides creating a natural park for the public, the county is using the project 
to determine if large artificial wetlands can be created to attract declining 
species such as the California gnatcatcher, said Denton D. Turner, design 
manager for the harbors, beaches and parks division of the county's 
Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The project also includes artificial wetlands planned for the Aliso/Wood 
Canyons Regional Park in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The goal at Mason Park is to dig closer to the water table and create channels 
for the natural runoff from neighboring streets to enlarge the natural 15-acre 
wetlands now at the park, Turner said. Native wetland trees and shrubs will be 
planted beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which will cost about $400,000, will add about 
30 acres of wetlands to the park. 
</P>
<P>
After about three years, when the plants have had a chance to take root and 
grow, the irrigation system will be removed and the plants will be left in 
their natural state, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The first test will be to see if the plants thrive without artificial 
maintenance. "The second test will be, 'Do the critters like it?' " Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose of the wetlands projects is to create parks and new homes 
for wildlife, he said. But if the plants thrive and animals take up residence, 
the county might be able to use the new wetlands as a trade-off for wetlands 
slated for development. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits destruction of wetlands where alternatives exist. When 
there are no feasible alternatives, federal agencies require builders to 
restore wetlands affected by the new construction or improve wetlands elsewhere 
to make up for the lost habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Compensating for destroyed wetlands by restoring wetlands elsewhere, though, is 
the Environmental Protection Agency's least preferred alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"The (regulating) agencies are a little dubious," Turner said. "They don't want 
to see the county or any developer use this as a cheap fix." TOM McQUEENEY

MARINE KILLED IN CHICAGO STREET CRIME

<P>
A Tustin-based Marine who was visiting his family in Chicago was killed in what 
police believe may have been a bungled robbery attempt, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Michael Sublett, 20, was shot in the head late Sunday night while he was 
backing his new Ford Mustang into the garage behind his parents' home, Chicago 
Police Detective Cmdr. Robert Beavers said. He was pronounced dead at Roseland 
Hospital early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett, who grew up in Chicago, had gone out to a nearby McDonald's a short 
time earlier and was bringing back food for himself and his wife, Latanya 
Sublett, Beavers said. Neighbors reported hearing shots in the alley behind the 
Subletts' home, then a car leaving the area at high speed. So far, no witnesses 
to the shooting have surfaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett's mother discovered her son slumped in the car at 11:55 p.m. He had 
been shot at least once, Beavers said.

"Right now, we're approaching this on an angle of a robbery that went bad," 
Beavers said. "Whatever develops . . we'll go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Sublett had just bought the blue Mustang and had planned to drive back to 
Tustin with his wife, Beavers said. "He had to be back in Tustin on Sept. 1, so 
they were going to leave today," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, Lonnie Chambers, said Sublett "was one of the best kids you could 
ever see. He was not a young man like the average man who is always into 
something. He was the kind of child who was obedient. He was one of the very 
few young men I know who said Mr. and Mrs." 
</P>
<P>
Sublett enlisted in the Marines on Dec. 29, 1987, according to a corps 
spokesman, Master Sgt. Steve Merrill. He reported to the Tustin Marine Corps 
Air Station in November, 1988, and most recently was assigned to Marine Medium 
Helicopter Squadron No. 166, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, where he worked as an 
avionics technician on CH-46 helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett received a Humanitarian Service Medal for relief work after the 1989 
Bay Area earthquake, and a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, which acknowledges a 
year's service either overseas or aboard a ship, Merrill said. He was promoted 
to corporal on June 1 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett and his wife lived in an apartment in Tustin, Merrill said. BOB

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER DEFENDANT DESCRIBED AS 'PATSY' 
</P>

<P>
The young man who drove the car from which shotgun fire wounded a 4-year-old 
girl last Christmas Eve in San Clemente was portrayed by his attorney Monday as 
a "patsy" for gang members. 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements, defense attorney Leroy Martin described Floyd Avery, 19, 
as a "quiet, timid" teen-ager who strove to get along with gang members in both 
San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente, since he often drove through both cities. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told the jury of eight women and four men that a member of the San Juan 
gang, who is also Avery's friend, planned a drive-by shooting and was looking 
for someone ignorant enough to drive. They found that person in Avery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole evening's activities paint a picture of a person who didn't stand up 
for himself, someone who was not acting sensible, not smart," Martin said. 
"Stupid, if you will, but not criminally." 
</P>
<P>
When a gang-member friend from San Juan suggested they go cruising, Martin 
said, Avery wanted to comply. While he was talking to his friend, two other 
gang members got into his car for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"Floyd Avery was the perfect patsy," Martin said. "A patsy is the person left 
holding the bag when the real culprits are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Avery didn't know about the 3-foot-long, sawed-off shotgun until 
one of his passengers approached a group of men standing on a San Clemente 
street and pulled the trigger. The shotgun jammed that time and the man got 
back in the car with directions for Avery to drive around the block, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Avery saw the shotgun, he became afraid for his safety and did what the 
gang members told him, Martin said. The next stop was the 100 block of Avenida 
Pelayo in San Clemente, where Prisca Caudillo, 4, was playing on the 
second-floor balcony of a neighbor's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A single shot, aimed at four men standing under the balcony, sprayed Prisca 
with shotgun pellets in the face and upper torso about 7:30 p.m. Christmas Eve. 
She was released from the hospital five days later. 
</P>
<P>
Three juvenile gang members have been convicted in connection with the drive-by 
shooting, San Clemente's first to result in injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Avery faces 19 charges, including attempted murder and allowing a passenger to 
discharge a weapon from his vehicle, and could face up to 18 years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Avery was being held in Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail. Attorneys expect 
to present closing arguments Thursday. LUCY CHABOT

PEOPLE: SPOTTER FISHING FOR COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pamela Hengsteler, 42, goes fishing seven hours a day, seven days a week in a 
rented airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, she spots swordfish for fishermen who are bobbing along Catalina 
Island waiting for her radio message of a sighting. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make a catch, I make a catch," she said, pointing out that a good day 
is three swordfish, even though one would be OK. "I have to hope they have a 
good harpooner." 
</P>
<P>
Hengsteler said that if the fishermen end up with empty hooks, she ends up with 
an empty purse. "The fishermen pay for the plane rental if they hook the fish I 
spot," she said. "Otherwise, I have to pay the rental and the gas." 
</P>
<P>
The rented plane is equipped with extra gas tanks for her seven-hour flights. 
</P>
<P>
A good day means that she also gets a financial share of the swordfish which 
sells for around $12 a pound in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
And a good swordfish can weigh 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been recent slim pickings in the ocean waters off Catalina 
where she flies, Hengsteler has an ulterior motive for her fish patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"I need the flight time to qualify as an airline or corporate pilot," said the 
Fountain Valley woman, who has 600 hours of flight time to her credit. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial airlines require a minimum of 1,000 hours of flight time for its 
pilots,but "most airlines prefer 2,000 hours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fish spotting helps ring up free flight time, but they are tough flights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult flying six or seven hours straight," said Hengsteler, who was 
recently named Pilot of the Year by the Orange County Ninety-Nines, an 
organization of female pilots. 
</P>
<P>
The group also presented Hengsteler a scholarship for flight instructors' 
advanced training, another wAy for her to get flight time in by training others 
who want to be pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Before she ran aCross the fish-spotting job, Hengsteler hand-washed planes to 
raise money for plane rentals. 
</P>
<P>
She charged $35 to wash a small plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember this guy walked up and asked if I would wash his plane, and I just 
about had a heart attack," she said. "He had a twin-engine corporate jet that 
would have taken me two days to do. I declined." 
</P>
<P>
She called her service Pam's Pretty Planes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a catchy title," she said, speaking softly with the remnants 
of her West Virginia twang. 
</P>
<P>
Hengsteler said her yearning to fly started at age 12. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a grass landing strip near our home, and I would watch the planes 
land and take off, and it excited me," she said. "I lived in an extremely rural 
area in West Virginia and didn't think I'd ever get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Hengsteler, who attended West Virginia University, Orange Coast College and UC 
Irvine, admits that she is a Pamela-come-lately since she didn't start flying 
until five years ago because she couldn't afford flying lessons. 
</P>
<P>
After college she took jobs waitressing, singing and working as a professional 
photographer to save money for flying lessons. "I sometimes would sing at the 
wedding where I took the pictures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides flying, "my other ambition was to do a combination Julie Andrews-Barbra 
Streisand singing thing." She said that didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Now her goals are set in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about my life," said the wife of David Hengsteler Jr., a 
lighting electrician for Paramount Studios. "I want to be a commercial pilot." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, she would rather fly jets for a private business. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually have a more balanced work schedule than the commercial airline. 
It's almost like having an 8-to-5 job with better pay, hours and job security," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Tustin resident Joseph E. Irvine, executive director of the 
Orange County Aviation Council, has been presented the annual Wannamaker Award 
from the California Assn. of Airport Executives. It is given to a person who 
"makes a substantial contribution to air transportation." The council was 
formed in 1974 by business and civic leaders and has been a continual advocate 
of improved air transportation for Orange County.

Pablo Ramos tried to show off a little Monday night, but all it did was set off 
Ben Lopez. Lopez of Upland landed a short but powerful left to the chin of 
Ramos at 1:33 of the third round to end the super featherweight bout in front 
of 1,142 at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Both fighters attacked, and Lopez had the better of the first two rounds, but 
Ramos offered some additional incentive. At one point in the first round, he 
dropped his gloves out to his sides and smiled to show Lopez the punches didn't 
hurt much. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Ramos stopped and rested on the ropes with another smirk after 
Lopez finished a pair of combinations. Other times, Ramos (18-5) leaned his 
head forward with a giant grin to taunt Lopez as he moved around the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"It got me a little more upset," Lopez said of the antics. "It made me want to 
knock him out more . . . In the first round I just sat back and took punches. I 
was testing his power. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I knew he couldn't hurt me so I just went after him. I wanted to 
work on my right, but the left is my baby and it was there." 
</P>
<P>
After Lopez (16-6) threw the final punch, he tripped over Ramos as Lopez went 
across the ring. It was the 11th knockout for Lopez, who is the state super 
featherweight champion. This was a non-title defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to follow him," Lopez said. "I wanted to make a face at him before he 
went down, but it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos was on his back for about two minutes but left the ring under his own 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The main-event knockout completed a sweep of sorts Monday night. There were six 
knockouts in six fights. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier bouts: Shane Kaplan, who is becoming a crowd favorite, scored an 
impressive third-round knockout. Kaplan of Irvine floored Kelly Green of 
Ontario at 155 pounds as several stood to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan also brings a following of some 20 or so friends, much like the noisy 
group that supports John Armijo, the fighting lifeguard from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan made his professional debut last month at Irvine and scored a 
first-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Castenada of La Habra scored a first-round knockout over Carlos Valdivia 
of San Diego at 182 pounds. Castenada (5-5) dropped Valdivia (0-1) at 2:30 into 
the first round, then continued his attack until he got the knockout with one 
second left in the round. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Martin of Anaheim also scored a knockout, this one coming in the third 
round. Martin (2-0) stopped Steve Turchetta 30 seconds into the third round of 
the 141-pound bout. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Chavez of Santa Ana takes on Mario Solorio of Ventura in the next main 
event, Sept. 27 . . . The bouts switch to Thursday night for the rest of the 
year, so as not to compete with Monday night football telecasts. Besides Sept. 
27, fights will be held Oct. 25th and Nov. 29.

4 SUITORS SCAN BOOKS AS SALE OF MERCURY NEARS

Federal regulators are preparing to sell Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and 
sources on Monday said that at least four potential bidders are currently 
reviewing the books of the $2-billion institution. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the suitors include Security Pacific National Bank of Los 
Angeles, Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly Hills, American Savings Bank 
of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal Savings Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Scalzi, western regional director of the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
federal agency charged with overseeing the sale of government-run S&amp;Ls, 
would not identify the potential bidders but said several major California 
banks and S&amp;Ls are actively pursuing acquisition of Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a deal done before the end of September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons for potential bidders declined comment, but at least three of the 
four companies identified by sources have been active in the acquisition arena 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the growing number of S&amp;L seizures under the tough new financial 
standards imposed by Congress in 1989, regulators are attempting to speed up 
the sales process. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which was declared insolvent in February, is just one of 18 California 
S&amp;Ls put up for sale since June. If it is sold as early as next month, it 
would be one of the quickest sales under RTC management. 
</P>
<P>
With its 24 branches and loyal customer base, Mercury would make a good 
addition to many major institutions' network of offices, financial institutions 
consultant Edward Carpenter, head of the Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa 
Ana, suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said several of his firm's large banking and S&amp;L clients are 
among the institutions negotiating to acquire Mercury's branches, deposits and 
some of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
In an S&amp;L sale, the government typically retains the assets that got the 
S&amp;L in trouble -- typically loans in default, repossessed real estate and 
hard-to-sell high-yield corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which was founded in 1964 and had grown to nearly $5 billion in assets 
in the mid-1980s, was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators in 
February after posting a loss of nearly $40 million for 1989. At the time, 
Mercury had about $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's problems didn't come from the insider abuses and speculative 
investing policies that led many S&amp;Ls to ruin. Instead, the losses that ate 
up its capital came mainly from two large commercial loans that went into 
default last year and from accounting changes under the new federal financial 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
So while Mercury's capital was below the minimum required by law when it was 
taken over, it was in much better financial shape than many other S&amp;Ls that 
have been seized. That, Carpenter said, makes it an attractive acquisition 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four institutions known to be interested, Great Western has been the 
most aggressive in seeking to grow through acquisitions. The company, already 
the 21st-largest financial institution in California, recently acquired a 
number of branches on the west coast of Florida, spokeswoman Lynn Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Great Western acquired 13 Florida branches of Carteret Savings Bank of 
Morristown, N.J., for a premium of $26.5 million. The branches had $700 million 
in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Great Western bought 71 branches of CenTrust Savings Bank in 
Miami for a premium of $61 million and 18 branches of the Gibraltar Savings 
Bank of Florida, with deposits of $700 million, for a premium of $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Great Western had $39 billion in assets. For the six months 
ended June 30, the company had net income of $152 million, compared to $109 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Great Western's acquisition strategy is to target markets with 
growth potential in which the company is not represented and markets, such as 
Orange County, where it can gain economies of scale from advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp., the Los Angeles-based parent of Security Pacific 
National Bank and the state's fourth-largest financial institution, also has 
been looking for acquisitions among troubled thrifts, spokesman Chuck Lemoine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The company acquired 83 branches of Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan in June, 
paying a premium of $141 million and acquiring assets of $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has assets of $94.5 billion and reported net income of $383 
million for the six months ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings Bank in Irvine has just entered the buyout business. The 
company, acquired by the Robert M. Bass Group in December, 1988, for $500 
million in capital and $1.7 billion in government assistance, in June acquired 
two branches of Huntington Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings paid a premium of $1.5 million for Huntington Federal, which 
had deposits of $112.7 million. The privately owned American Savings has assets 
of $16 billion and reported net income of $214.2 million for 1989, spokeswoman 
Dianne Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
First Fed Financial Corp., the parent of First Federal Bank of California, 
could not be reached for comment. The company is the eighth-largest financial 
institution in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-based firm reported net income of $7.1 million for the second 
quarter ended June 30, up 73% over the same period last year. At the end of 
1989, the company had $2.6 billion in assets and 15 branches.

O.C. ESCAPES STATEWIDE PLUNGE IN HOME RESALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As California's residential real estate market continued cooling in July, with 
sales of existing houses falling to the lowest level in 4 1/2 years, Orange 
County sales and prices held stable for the month, an industry trade group 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of single-family homes in the county slipped only 0.1% from June to July, 
contrasted with a 5.3% decline statewide. For the 12 months ended in July, 
however, the sales pace in Orange County tumbled 18.7%, whereas the decline 
statewide was 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the appreciation was nowhere near the staggering double-digit rates of 
1988, the median price of a resale home in Orange County rose 0.5% in July, to 
$245,798 from $244,671 in July, 1989. But last month's price was 0.5% lower 
than the $247,078 median reported for the county in June, according to Calif 
Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, only the desert resort areas and the much lower-priced 
Riverside/San Bernardino area posted price increases over the year before. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of new homes being completed and added to the 
Southland residential market is soaring, a university research group reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of unsold new tract homes in the six Southern California 
counties rose 45.3% to 18,069 units at the end of June, from 12,437 units at 
the beginning of the year, according to the Real Estate Research Council of 
Southern California, which is sponsored by Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in unsold new homes was particularly high for San Bernardino and 
Los Angeles counties. Orange County builders put nearly 1,000 new homes into 
the market during the first half of the year -- a 45% increase, to 3,029 units 
in July from 2,090 units in January. The July inventory level was the county's 
highest since November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate specialists say that the soaring supply of unsold new homes is 
contributing to the slump in resale activity. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide decline in housing prices continues a trend that began four 
months ago. The median price of a resale house in California is now $194,099, 
or 3.7% less than in July, 1989, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The price dip is particularly troublesome for those who bought houses at the 
peak of the market in 1989 and are facing large losses if they have to sell in 
today's softening market. 
</P>
<P>
The California housing market peaked in the first half of last year and has 
generally declined ever since. The decline has accelerated in recent months, 
marked by the first year-to-year declines in housing prices since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
As soft as the housing market has become, however, it "is probably going to get 
worse over the next six months," said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Center for 
Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. 
Economists blame the uncertainty in the Middle East that has placed a cloud 
over the entire U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
According to the realtors association, the pace of housing resales statewide 
fell to an annual rate of 419,943 in July, off 15% from a year ago and down 
5.3% from June of this year. The sales figures reflect how many homes would be 
sold in 1990 had the July pace continued all year. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of housing resales has not been this slow since December, 1985, 
according to Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the realtors 
association. She said resale levels will probably continue dropping in August. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a severe recession, the California housing market should remain weak 
for another 18 months before it begins to recover, Rosen said. About 450,00 
single-family houses will be sold in California in 1990, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
However, if there is a severe recession, it will send the residential real 
estate market into a tailspin not seen since the dark days of the early 1980s, 
when home prices in California fell as much as 10% on a year-to-year basis, 
Rosen said. The market hit bottom in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that the overall value of single-family detached homes 
in greater Los Angeles has dropped 4.5% since July, 1989. The median price of a 
house sold in the Los Angeles area last month was $215,533, compared to 
$225,616 in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Prices dropped slightly in the San Diego area compared to year-ago levels, to 
$186,182 from $187,159. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Appleton-Young pointed out that the increasing coolness in the 
housing market has come at a time when the outlook for buyers is far more 
favorable than it was a year ago. The supply of houses is up, prices are down 
and mortgage rates have been stable, she said, but picky buyers are holding 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"What strikes me is that despite the improvements (for buyers), people are 
reluctant to buy a home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the housing market in an undeniable slump, most real estate economists 
say there is no reason for alarm -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
Tough times will not come until the pace of housing resales falls below 350,000 
annually, about where it was in 1981, according to Michael S. Salkin, manager 
of real-estate risk assessment for First Interstate Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're nowhere near a catastrophic level yet," Salkin said.

AST TO STEP UP SALES EFFORTS, EXPAND MARKET IN AFRICA 
</P>

<P>
AST Research Inc., an Irvine personal computer manufacturer that has 
aggressively pursued business opportunities in the Soviet Union, Japan and 
other foreign markets, on Monday announced plans to step up sales efforts in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it has created a separate African sales region to be managed from its 
Irvine headquarters, and that it plans to open its first sales office on the 
continent by 1993. The company named Javed Khan to head the new sales 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
AST plans to target multinational corporations, government and international 
agencies, and educational institutions in Africa, said Khan, who joined AST in 
1985 and has been responsible for recruiting distributors in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, AST sold only $500,000 in computers to the African nations of Ghana, 
Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zaire. It plans to start sales 
efforts in Botswana, Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
The personal computer industry has largely ignored Africa as a potential 
market, said Steve Lair, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose market 
researcher. He said that a general lack of financial resources, high illiteracy 
rates and diverse languages pose special problems in the African market. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Khan said AST believes that by making inroads into the African 
market now, it will be in a position "to set the pace for the modernization of 
the businesses in this region." 
</P>
<P>
AST plans to develop computer applications to meet the specific needs and 
resources of African countries, Khan said. "These (markets) are very price 
sensitive," he said. "Our machines and products will have to be priced in such 
a way that they will be affordable to the general population and businesses." 
</P>
<P>
AST had sales of $533.8 million for its fiscal year ended June, 1990, about 36% 
of which came from the international market. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Irvine firm has stepped up sales efforts in the Soviet Union and 
China. This year, it became the first U.S. company to announce plans to market 
a computer in Japan that is compatible with industry standard machines made by 
Japan's NEC Corp.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: SOUTH PLACENTIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Here in what is the southern "tip" of Placentia, a subtle reminder of Orange 
County's past stands aside for its pedestrian present. A wooden trellis on 
Crowther Avenue designates the site of the Ontiveros Adobe. Mounted on a stone 
under the trellis, the plaque shares space with several industrial parks west 
of Kraemer Boulevard at Porter Way. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Pacifico Ontiveros received a Mexican land grant for the Rancho San Juan 
Cajon de Santa Ana (35,970 acres) in 1837. He built the adobe that bears his 
name in 1841. The land subsequently was parceled out: 1,165 acres were sold to 
German colonists for $2 an acre to found what became Anaheim; other portions 
later evolved into Fullerton and Brea, as well as Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ontiveros Adobe would have been the oldest standing adobe in North Orange 
County," said Cecil Rospaw, vice chairman of the Placentia Historical 
Committee, a nine-member group appointed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The adobe's site (a total of 3,900 acres) was purchased by Daniel Kraemer, an 
Illinois farmer. The adobe ultimately ended up in the hands of one of his 
grandsons, Ben Kraemer, who modernized it as late as 1940 -- into a California 
bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been lived in over the years and had been so modified that it had lost 
a lot of its historical character," said Jack Slota, assistant city 
administrator. "Even the historical society didn't think it was worth the 
recovery." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult," Rospaw said. "I toured with two very well known county 
historians. (He was with the Orange County Historical Commission at the time.) 
They both gave reports to the city saying that while you could find the old 
adobe and the original square nails, they couldn't justify the expense 
($100,000 to the city of Placentia) to restore the original adobe." 
</P>
<P>
The (Ben) Kraemer family never found oil on their property, Rospaw said. But in 
the 1970s there was a chance to sell the land. The estimated price: $70,000 to 
$80,000 per acre, a latter-day form of striking it rich. "It's an absolute 
tragedy," said Rospaw of the loss of the Ontiveros adobe, "but in this 
(historical preservation) you have to figure out what can be done and what 
can't be done." 
</P>
<P>
What couldn't be done this time was having the taxpayers foot the bill for the 
restoration. The result is the series of heartless industrial parks spanning 
Crowther Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The only people liable to pay homage at the Ontiveros Adobe historical site 
plaque are workers at neighboring industrial centers or truck drivers making 
deliveries there. Children traveling by at top speed on their bicycles appear 
to have no time to stop and read the marker under the wooden arborway, much 
less grasp the image of a time and lifestyle so far removed. 
</P>
<P>
In a neighborhood whose residents are 55% Latino, it is no surprise to find 
something like Placita Santa Fe ("Old Town"). Populated with establishments 
such as the Mexican Supermarket and restaurants such as El Farolito and Mi 
Ranchito, it is a commercial area serving locals. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one that has attained countywide acclaim: Santa Fe Avenue's 
Tlaquepaque Restaurant. Raul Davis opened the bakery and family restaurant in 
1963, and fruit pickers once jammed the place for breakfast before heading off 
to work in the surrounding orange groves. It still opens every morning at 6 
(even though the orange groves are gone), filling the morning air with wondrous 
aromas. In the 1970s, Davis' father, also named Raul, hired El Mariachi 
Uclatlan to perform for an hour every Friday at lunchtime. The group, which 
first made its mark in the county at Tlaquepaque, opened the El Mariachi 
restaurant in Orange in 1981. 
</P>

JOSEPH N. BELL: RESERVISTS ADOPT A HEALTHIER VIEW OF MILITARY CRAP SHOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's call-up of military reserves by President Bush struck some painful 
chords here. It reminded me of a period from mid-1950 through 1951 when 
President Harry Truman did the same thing. And I was sitting on the catbird 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, there were two types of miliary reservists: active and inactive 
(they go by different names today). The active reservists were the weekend 
warriors, the men and women who drilled once a month, went to a two-week summer 
camp and continued to be an integral part of the military. For this they were 
paid, and the time could also be accumulated to provide for a higher rank and a 
substantial pension after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The inactive reserve was made up of people like me who developed certain skills 
during World War II that were deemed vital enough that we weren't permitted out 
of the reserves. There was nothing voluntary about our reserve status. We were 
in because they wouldn't let us out. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted out. I had spent four years on active duty in World War II and had 
amassed almost 2,000 flying hours when the war ended. I was saturated with both 
the military and flying, and I wanted to be a civilian again as soon as 
possible. The peacetime military held no charm for me. 
</P>
<P>
So in the five years between the end of World War II and the beginning of the 
Korean War, I was surely the most inactive reservist in military history. There 
were times I didn't even read my mail from the military. When I went back to 
college at war's end, I was married and had one child. When Korea came along, I 
had three children, a mortgage on a house and my first decent-paying job. I was 
beginning to sell writing to magazines and taking part in another war -- 
especially one as fuzzy as the Korean conflict -- was rock bottom on the list 
of things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Most of my World War II buddies felt the same way -- but not all of them took 
the same route. There were two groups in particular who were attracted to the 
active reserve. First, those who were still enamored of flying and wanted the 
chance to play with military aircraft free of charge. And, second, those who 
wanted to build up rank and hang out with the reserves until they could collect 
retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed little risk in the active reserve route then. After all, we'd just 
brought two superpowers to their knees and won the second war to end wars. 
Surely there would be a long enough grace period for these veterans to reach 
retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
The reasoning was OK, and if I hadn't been so turned off by the military, I 
might have considered it, too. But my first day of the peacetime Navy gave me 
all the inkling I needed. The day after the Japanese surrendered, officers were 
ordered to begin wearing ties at all times on the crummy island where I was 
then stationed. And shortly thereafter, my return home was almost delayed 
because I had lost two pieces of flight gear that the Navy routinely burned 
when it was turned in. 
</P>
<P>
So when Truman began calling up the reserves to go to Korea, the bleats from my 
peers who chose to remain in the active reserves were loud and anguished. And 
that's when I began to develop the hard-nosed attitude I have today about 
weekend warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever reason prompts a person to join the reserves -- patriotism, money, 
retirement, the chance to sharpen skills or play war without danger, a need to 
get away from the old lady or the old man -- there is also a risk implicit in 
that decision: the risk that they may be called to active duty for a multitude 
of reasons. That's why I don't feel particularly sorry for them if that 
happens. It's a crap shoot, and you win some and lose some. 
</P>
<P>
But I felt pretty sorry for myself during the Korean War because the Truman 
call-up reached into many thousands of inactive reservists. We had a pretty 
good network going among ourselves and we knew when inactive reservists with 
our skills began getting called up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a miserable year for me. I dreaded going home to look at the mail, and I 
was paranoid about telegrams. A lot of my inactive reservist buddies went to 
Korea, and some of them were killed. But this time the dice rolled right for 
me. I was never called. 
</P>
<P>
After Korea the risk of being sent into combat as a reservist went down 
considerably, even though we spent almost 10 years bogged down militarily in 
Vietnam. The Establishment reason was that we needed the reserves as a backup 
force at home for trouble spots that might develop elsewhere. In my opinion, 
the real reason was that Lyndon Johnson -- with steadily declining support at 
home for our involvement in Vietnam -- couldn't risk sending the reserves 
overseas because they were mostly made up of the sons of middle and upper-class 
Americans whom Johnson didn't care to antagonize. 
</P>
<P>
Our current vice president of the United States was one of those people. For 
all his protestations, the reserves provided a haven for a lot of young men 
with clout to avoid combat. I'm not judging this. I think I would have used any 
device that came to hand to avoid going to Vietnam. I just wish J. Danforth 
Quayle could have been honest about it. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the reserves -- along with graduate studies in college, putting braces 
on teeth and phonied-up physical infirmities -- provided safe houses for those 
who had the necessary resources to avoid Vietnam. The ultimate hypocrites were 
eligible draftees (and their parents) who used such means and then castigated 
those who fled to Canada. That's why I get a little queasiness in the pit of my 
stomach when I hear all this unctuous talk about the reserves of that period 
representing the ultimate in patriotism. The young men without clout who were 
drafted and sent to fight that miserable war were the real heroes. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly understandable, however, that the failure to activate the 
reserves en masse for combat duty in Vietnam may have had more than a passing 
influence in persuading some of the current reservists to join up. If so, it 
must have come as a bit of a shock when George Bush reached into the reserves 
very quickly in the current Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The quotes that I've been reading from Orange County reservists in the 
newspaper make it appear that we have a very different crew here. They are 
hardly ecstatic but most have accepted their military responsibilities 
matter-of-factly even though it will mean a considerable dislocation for many 
of them in their civilian lives. Without debating the merit of what Bush is 
doing in the Persian Gulf, this attitude on the part of reservists is healthy 
and the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
We've come a long way in establishing the identity of the reserves since those 
frenetic months in Korea and those tragic years in Vietnam. Maybe we've hit on 
the right formula now. But let's all hope that the reserves who have been 
called up will all be back at their civilian jobs in a few months. Or sooner.

SKIPPING THE ALCOHOL TO DRIVE HOME A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No need to skip the suds 
</P>
<P>
What's this? The president of Orange County Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
sipping a beer at the organization's 10th anniversary gala Sunday night? 
</P>
<P>
"It's non-alcoholic, of course," Julie Newell explained. "And it tastes pretty 
good, too." 
</P>
<P>
Guests at MADD's Main Event, held at MainPlace/Santa Ana mall, sampled three 
brands of alcohol-free beer, several varieties of Ariel Vineyards' 
non-alcoholic wines, mineral water and soft drinks as well as gourmet food 
offerings from a dozen area restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I just heard that Ariel is one of the fastest-growing vineyards in the state," 
said chapter executive director Janet Cater, whose own beverage preferences 
lean toward raspberry-flavored mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
As several MADD members pointed out, Ariel's success and the fact that 
companies such as Heineken, Miller and Anheuser-Busch now offer non-alcoholic 
alternatives is in its own way a testament to the organization's success in 
changing attitudes toward drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not socially acceptable anymore," Newell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just for fun 
</P>
<P>
The event may have been a sober one, but it wasn't nearly as sobering as most 
other MADD get-togethers. "This is the first time we've ever put something 
together just for fun," said Sherry Metcalfe, former Orange County MADD 
president, who chaired the event. Except for a table of brochures and bumper 
stickers off in a corner, MADD kept its message off the menu for this one 
evening. "I think there are a lot of people out there who support us but don't 
need to hear the message. They're already on our side." About 200 guests paid 
$35 each to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure fun for all, Metcalfe made sure there was entertainment for every 
imaginable taste. While a ragtime band held court outside Nordstrom, an Elvis 
impersonator gyrated down by Robinson's. In between, jugglers, magicians, 
caricature artists, clowns and other entertainers worked their way through the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
As did State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) and Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove), both staunch MADD supporters. "I'm carrying a bill right now 
for Orange County MADD," Royce said. That bill would make it impossible for a 
drunk driver to sue a victim or a victim's estate, as happened in one Orange 
County case." If the bill passes, it will join the dozens of others in 
California and thousands nationwide that have made it onto the books thanks to 
MADD. 
</P>
<P>
"MADD shifted the balance of power in the Legislature," Royce said. "For years, 
the prevailing attitude was one of solidarity with the defense bar. But that 
isn't the case anymore. Now when MADD backs a bill, you know there's going to 
be a lot of noise made about it." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County MADD members, the legislators said, are particularly vocal. 
</P>
<P>
"They write lots of letters," Pringle said, "And when you get a letter from an 
individual, it really has an impact." 
</P>
<P>
"They're also willing to come to Sacramento and testify, again and again," 
Royce said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did you bring the handcuffs, dear? 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were gravel-throated soap star Jeanne Cooper (Katherine Chancellor 
Sterling) of "The Young and the Restless" and fellow cast members Michael 
Gregary (Clint), Quinn Redecker (Rex Sterling) and Kate Linder (Esther the 
housekeeper). 
</P>
<P>
"Here's Michael, who kidnaped me, and Quinn, who betrayed me, and Kate, my 
maid," Cooper said. "So I kidnaped them and brought them here for this. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very much behind Orange County MADD. I became aware of their work when I 
did a public appearance here, and I was very impressed. They're a very strong 
voice in the state. They've banged their heads against the wall for so long, 
and it's really made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
A silent auction of items donated by mall merchants and others brought the net 
proceeds of the event to more than $3,000, Cater said.

GROVE SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL UPDATING 'OTHELLO' -- BUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Does anybody ever set Shakespearean productions in their own time? Not at the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival, to judge from the current season. 
</P>
<P>
First came "Much Ado About Nothing," which Jules Aaron updated to the late 
1930s and set in Fascist Italy. Then there was "As You Like It," which Tom 
Bradac set in turn-of-the-century America. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes an updated version of "Othello," which David Herman (no relation to 
this writer) has decided to place during post-Napoleonic times. The production 
begins a 3 1/2-week run Thursday at the outdoor Festival Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a point to all of this? Some creative purpose shared by these 
directors? Or are they simply trying to throw their weight around and assert 
their authority at Shakespeare's expense? 
</P>
<P>
The basic answer is that each of them has sought a user-friendly metaphor, in 
effect, to help clarify the meaning of the play -- not because it was so 
abstruse but simply to bring it closer to a contemporary audience. 
</P>
<P>
In "Much Ado," Aaron wanted to emphasize the pervasive element of an 
eavesdropping society rife with the manipulation of private lives. The updated 
setting worked chiefly because it poked highly theatrical fun at the Italian 
Fascists in charge. Had they been German Nazis, though, it's doubtful audiences 
would have laughed. 
</P>
<P>
In "As You Like It," Bradac wanted to reinforce the poignancy of its pastoral 
theme by suggesting an American era when industrial growth and city values 
seriously began to encroach on rural life. While the idea for the update made 
sense, it never seemed relevant to the actual production beyond a few minor 
details. In fact, the turn-of-the-century spin was invisible except for the 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bradac's production offered considerable charm, proof perhaps that all "As 
You Like It" really needs to succeed is skillful negotiation of its languorous 
plot by actors able to deliver some of the most appealing speeches in the 
Shakespeare canon. 
</P>
<P>
Herman says his purpose in updating "Othello" to post-Napoleonic times is to 
underscore its military atmosphere. The tragic hero of the play, after all, is 
a valiant army general sent by the Duke of Venice to defend Cyprus against a 
Turkish invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Herman does not dispute for a moment that, despite Othello's mission, the play 
is essentially a tale of domestic woe hardly concerned with matters of state, 
military or otherwise, unlike "Hamlet," "King Lear" or "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that "Othello" strictly chronicles the swift downfall of a proud, 
magnanimous man whose doom is sealed when false stories impugning the 
faithfulness of his new bride, Desdemona, infect him with an uncharacteristic 
jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Herman maintains, it is crucial to establish the texture of life 
in an isolated military outpost, even if he achieves it merely in visual terms 
with recognizable uniforms of the 19th-Century rather than the less familiar 
doublet and hose of 400 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that an easily appreciated garrison atmosphere will help to convey 
how Othello could be taken in by sexual gossip, culminating in Desdemona's 
murder and his suicide. Moreover, he says the military metaphor will help to 
set in context the bitterness of Iago, a career soldier who seeks Othello's 
ruin because he has been passed over for promotion in favor of the 
less-experienced but higher-born Cassio. 
</P>
<P>
Given Herman's thinking -- and with American troops now establishing desert 
fortifications in Saudi Arabia -- would it have been more interesting to set 
"Othello" there? Such a contemporary mise en scene might offer an even greater 
resonance than the one Herman anticipates. Though not exact, some of the 
parallels to the Persian Gulf crisis would be striking. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: While the Venetians have hired Othello to defend their interests 
because of his military prowess, they can't help regarding him with a certain 
distaste as an interloper. So, too, the Saudis, who have invited U.S. troops to 
defend their interests (and ours), but still regard their American protectors 
as unsavory intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: Othello is black, a fact noted more than once by labeling him with an 
Elizabethan epithet. Indeed, Iago calls him "the Moor" as an explicit reminder 
to other Venetians that Othello is neither white nor one of them. It might be 
pointed out -- if only for the sake of a coincidence too good to pass up and 
not with any imputation of Saudi racism -- that America's top general, Colin 
Powell, is also black. 
</P>
<P>
Since timing means everything in the theater, the Persian Gulf crisis must have 
come too late in rehearsals for Herman to exploit as a concept. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he has no doubt that without any additional help "Othello" expresses an 
aspect of social insularity in Shakespeare's time that is prevalent in England 
to this day and in many other societies. "Outsiders are fine, providing they 
fulfill a function and you have a need for them," the British-born director 
says. "But they're not really one of you." 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Othello is seen, most notably by Desdemona and Cassio, as head 
and shoulders above the common run of men. He is the instance of "a perfect 
soul," as Cassio says. Herman concurs: "Although he is a warrior, he is an 
incredible human being who has balanced his physical, philosophical, mental, 
poetical and artistic skills. He is almost a kind of Greek ideal, the complete 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Why then is this paragon so myopic when it comes to Iago's vengeful 
machinations? Is it, as Shakespearean scholars have always explained, that he 
hasn't had much experience of the world off the battlefield? Presumably, a 
post-Napoleonic "Othello" will shed new light. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grove Shakespeare Festival production of "Othello" begins Thursday and 
will run through Sept. 22 at the Festival Amphitheatre, 12852 Main St., Garden 
Grove. Performances are Thursdays to Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $16 to $23.

Foothill Thrift Verdict: A Superior Court jury awarded $564,000 to a defunct 
video surveillance firm that had alleged that Foothill Thrift &amp; Loan in Los 
Angeles improperly cut off its line of credit and liquidated the firm when it 
was losing money in 1985. Foothill had extended a line of credit of about $8 
million to Videoscope Inc., which sold its equipment to such customers as 
convenience stores, banks and hotels. Plaintiffs in the case had originally 
sought $11.5 million from Foothill.

Investors Expert Merger: Shares of International Lease Finance Corp. jumped 
$4.25 to close at $29.25 in trading, reflecting increased investor confidence 
that the firm's merger with American International Group Inc. will be 
consummated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the merger give shareholders the option of a $332.50-per-share cash 
buyout or a cash and stock swap. AIG share prices have firmed in recent days, 
apparently improving investor confidence about complex financial arrangements 
in the deal. The two firms disclosed Monday that 19.8 million of ILFC's 34 
million outstanding shares have been "elected" for the stock option.

We have acquired a new object to go with the tons of useless impedimenta that 
now lie around our swimming pool waiting to be stuffed back into the garage 
when our remodeling project is finished. 
</P>
<P>
It is a 60-pound rock. It is, of course, not just any rock. It is one of 
thousands of similar rocks dredged out of the earth at 6th and Flower, in 1969, 
during the excavation for Arco Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
It is about 14 inches long and 8 inches high. I can attest that it weighs 60 
pounds. When my wife carried it in from her car, she was obviously struggling 
more than she does with our 40-pound sacks of dog food. She set it down on the 
patio above the pool. I tried to lift it and decided I'd better not. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like a chunk of hardened gray sludge, except that its surface is 
covered with fossils -- the whitened outlines of mollusks, snails and 
crustaceans. These life forms are said to be 7 million to 8 million years old. 
So at that time, evidently, downtown Los Angeles was under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
We are indebted for the rock to our friend John D. Weaver, who discovered this 
geological treasure back in 1970 and wrote an article on it for The Times' West 
magazine. Weaver at that time evidently was given several rocks from the dig as 
souvenirs, and earmarked one for us. 
</P>
<P>
In his article, Weaver explained what had happened. It was the eve of the Ice 
Age. The Los Angeles basin was under the ocean. Prehistoric snails and clams 
had an easy life in the warm shallow water, feeding on algae, plankton and one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," Weaver wrote, "an earthquake or a violent storm seems to have triggered 
a subterranean landslide. Along with cobbles and a good part of the shell bed 
below them, the mollusks flowed down the ancient sea bottom four or five miles 
south toward what is today the downtown area and ended up in some 2,000 feet of 
cold water at the corner of Sixth and Flower." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver quoted a paleontologist who explained that the change from warm to cold 
water caused lime to be precipitated, and it cemented the rocks and shellfish 
in a matrix. 
</P>
<P>
The paleontologist, Manley L. Natland, called the rock "mudstone," and said 
that it contained hundreds of thousands of little marine shells to the square 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
That means, of course, that our rock contains hundreds of thousands of marine 
fossils; it is part of the history of Los Angeles, and, in fact, may presage 
the fate to which we are yet doomed. 
</P>
<P>
My problem is what to do with it. When Weaver first told me he had saved a rock 
for me I was less than enthusiastic. I really didn't want another rock, no 
matter how important it might be in a geological sense. My wife had already 
carried back hundreds of rocks from Baja, and I had never been able to work up 
much interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
A year or so ago, Weaver, then a widower, remarried and moved from Encino to 
North Carolina. I hoped that was the end of the rock. But we received a phone 
call from a mutual friend, Jack Beck, saying that Weaver had left the rock for 
us in his care, and what did we want to do about it. I told him to hang on to 
it -- we'd think of something. 
</P>
<P>
The other day we received a letter from Beck. "I recall talking briefly to you 
on the phone at the time," he said, "and sensing that you were less than eager 
to take possession of the rock. Your subsequent laments about the state of your 
garage suggest the reason. . . . Still, the rock is here, awaiting your or 
Denise's pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
I was overcome by a sense of guilt. John Weaver, a prince of a man, had set 
that rock aside for us, and we were rejecting it. Not only were we rejecting 
the overtures of a good friend, but also an extraordinary piece of geological 
history. We should be proud to have that rock in our garage. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered, from Weaver's article, that the paleontologist Natland had formed 
a company to exploit the mudstone by having it sliced into cocktail table tops. 
I thought that, at worst, we could do that. Or I could use it to cover my bar. 
But when Natland contracted with a marble cutting company to slice his stones, 
it ruined their diamond saw blades. 
</P>
<P>
If Weaver happens to read this I hope he won't be offended. I treasure the 
rock. I think we must all be reminded that we weren't first on Earth; that 
other species have vanished, and we will too. 
</P>
<P>
However, I have the feeling that the rock will survive my wife and me. I can 
see our sons kicking through the junk in the garage and coming upon the rock. 
</P>
<P>
One will say, "What does that look like to you?" 
</P>
<P>
And the other will say, "Looks like a rock." 
</P>
<P>
They will conclude, of course, that it must have been important to us, and it 
will end up in one of their garages.

TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS TO 6-YEAR LOW

The U.S. trade deficit narrowed dramatically to $22.58 billion from April 
through June, the lowest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the 
government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts were quick to note that the deficit had been pushed lower 
primarily by falling oil prices, a situation that has been reversed by the Aug. 
2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the 14.1% improvement from a first-quarter deficit 
of $26.28 billion reflected lower petroleum imports and a record level of U.S. 
export sales. 
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter, U.S. exports totaled an all-time high of $96.74 
billion, up 0.5% from the previous record of $96.26 billion set in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is counting on continued strong export sales to provide 
the momentum needed to keep the country out of a recession, a prospect that has 
grown more uncertain with the economic shocks coming from the turmoil in the 
Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports fell 2.6% in the second quarter to $119.32 billion, an improvement 
of $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The $22.58-billion trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, 
was the smallest since a $21.3-billion deficit in the fourth quarter of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the biggest imbalance occurred with Japan, a deficit of $10.4 
billion, up slightly from a $10.3-billion first quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The United States posted a rare $1.5-billion second quarter surplus with 
Western Europe, up from a $400-million surplus in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in today's report on merchandise trade, calculated on a 
balance-of-payments basis, confirmed trends noted in the department's monthly 
merchandise trade reports, which showed a second quarter deficit of $20.15 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum imports, which had risen sharply in the first quarter, declined by 
$3.5 billion in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a sharp decline in 
price.

A young boy sitting on his bicycle was shot and killed in an unexplained 
attack, and a 12-year-old girl described by police as a "gang wanna-be" was 
critically wounded in another shooting, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Emiliano Landa, was hit once in the upper torso by shots fired at him 
and several of his friends Monday night in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
He was pronounced dead on arrival at Pioneer Hospital in Artesia, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whom police declined to identify, was shot in the head and chest by 
two gang members on foot who opened fire on her and two boys about 4 p.m. 
Monday as they stood near the corner of Vermont Avenue and Olympic Boulevard, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was in critical condition and on life-support systems at Childrens 
Hospital.

IRAQ TO FREE WOMEN, CHILDREN;

<P>
HUSSEIN'S ORDER STARTS WEDNESDAY

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced today that all women and children 
foreigners in Iraq are free to leave the country beginning Wednesday, the Iraqi 
News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein issued a decree "that all women and children who are foreigners in Iraq 
are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel whenever they want starting 
tomorrow, including the families Iraq is hosting," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many women and children are among the 500 
American hostages in Iraq. There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It also was not known if the decree also applied to the 2,500 American hostages 
in Kuwait. Baghdad, whose troops overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, now considers its 
oil-rich neighbor part of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a televised meeting Hussein held with a group of 
foreign families, in which he challenged President Bush and British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher to debate the Persian Gulf crisis with him on 
television "for the whole world to see." 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Baghdad moved to tighten its grip on Kuwait by declaring it a 19th 
province. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspapers published Hussein's decree turning Kuwait into an Iraqi 
province. The newspapers did not say when he issued the decree, which created 
the province of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait "has become Iraq's 19th province and there is no discussing this," Iraqi 
Information Director Naji al-Hadithi told French radio in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's longstanding claim to Kuwait is based on the fact that during the 
Ottoman Empire, Kuwait was part of the Basra governate. The British split it up 
after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House condemned Iraq for making Kuwait a province. 
"The reaction is quite obvious," said spokesman Roman Popadiuk. "The annexation 
is null and void. The whole United Nations has spoken on it. And that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Shipping sources said today that U.S. Navy warships enforcing the U.N. embargo 
against Iraq stopped two cargo ships and that crew members boarded one in the 
Gulf of Aqaba before allowing them to proceed to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be only the second time a ship was boarded and inspected by 
the U.S. Navy since the embargo began shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's televised meeting with the Westerners was shown on state-run Iraqi TV 
and was his second televised meeting with hostages. The Iraqi president said he 
is "ready and prepared for direct talks with Mr. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher. . . . 
Let us have the debate between me and them on television for the whole world to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler quickly dismissed Hussein's offer to 
debate, saying: "It's sick, and it doesn't even deserve a response. Come on, 
there is nothing to debate." 
</P>
<P>
She also said Iraq threatened today to expel an unspecified number of U.S. 
diplomats from Baghdad in retaliation for Washington's expulsion of 36 Iraqi 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"Our charge (d'affaires) in Baghdad was . . . told that the government of Iraq 
would take reciprocal action against our embassy in Baghdad in the wake of the 
actions we announced here yesterday," Tutwiler said.

A federal appeals court ruled today that Alaska natives, normally exempt from a 
moratorium on killing rare marine mammals, may be criminally prosecuted if 
their killing of the animals is found "wasteful." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholds the constitutionality of 
a provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act regulating wasteful killing of 
marine mammals by Indians, Aleuts or Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The law established a moratorium on taking or importing marine mammals or 
products made from the animals except for the making of authentic native 
handicrafts and clothing or meat sold for subsistence living in Alaskan 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits native Alaskans from wasting substantial portions of a marine 
mammal that was killed.

FICKLE MAGELLAN'S VENUS MAP MISSION ON HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
SPACECRAFT: ENGINEERS TRYING TO DETERMINE WHY ERRATIC PROBE KEEPS LOSING RADIO 
CONTACT WITH EARTH.

Magellan's mission to map the rugged surface of Venus is being delayed again so 
a team of 40 engineers can figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact 
with Earth, a NASA official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting for the last week in September to start mapping," said Tony 
Spear, Magellan project manager at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Spear had said Friday that engineers hoped to fix the problem in time to have 
Magellan working properly by mid-September. Before Magellan started 
malfunctioning, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration planned for 
it to make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship remained in a protective "safing mode" today, Spear said during 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers still haven't figured out why Magellan's radio link to Earth failed 
for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and again for 17 1/2 hours beginning Aug. 21, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
So Spear said he organized a "tiger team" of 40 engineers from the laboratory 
and from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan in Denver, to determine 
what is wrong with the spaceship and repair it. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan's $744-million mission is to use radar to peer through Venus' thick 
clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the planet's surface. It was 
launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures made during an Aug. 16 radar test showed extensive "Venusquake" 
faults, vast flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite 
impact crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on the surface of 
Earth's nearest planetary neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when Magellan entered 
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. It functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 
months it traveled a looping path of 948 million miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's braking rocket 
may have failed to separate from the spacecraft after it went into Venus orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix Magellan, but 
also because the spacecraft's troubles have left engineers "mentally and 
physically exhausted," Spear said. "We've decided to give the team three days 
off around Labor Day." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers want to make sure Magellan doesn't break down again when mapping is 
in progress because "it's not good for people's hearts," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Spear, fully aware of NASA's problems stemming from temporary grounding of the 
shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the Hubble Space Telescope, appealed to 
the public to "have patience" with Magellan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it work," he pledged. "Have confidence in us."

BUSH MAKES UNEXPECTED CATCH -- A HOOK IN HIS EAR

Someone on a fishing excursion today with President Bush and Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney hooked a big one -- the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
Camera crew members in a news boat following close behind said Mulroney 
appeared to be responsible for the hook that caught Bush's ear, a notion the 
Canadian prime minister did nothing to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a hostile act," Mulroney said. 
</P>
<P>
However, First Lady Barbara Bush, who said her husband "is fine," disputed that 
Mulroney was the culprit. She summoned son Jeb, who was also on the boat, and 
commanded him to tell reporters just who had hooked his father. 
</P>
<P>
Jeb just grinned sheepishly. Did Mulroney hook Bush? "That is really not true," 
he said and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater later confirmed that Jeb was 
responsible for accidentally piercing his father's right earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's physician on an accompanying boat attended to the wound. He snipped the 
fish hook with wire cutters and pulled the remainder of the hook through the 
ear, according to Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
"The President was strong and courageous throughout this exercise," Fitzwater 
told reporters traveling back to Washington with Bush aboard Air Force One. 
Fitzwater said the hook passed through the bottom, rounded part of the 
President's earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush continued to fish for about another hour and later received a tetanus 
shot. When he boarded Air Force One later in the morning, no evidence of a 
wound or bandage could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second boating mishap involving Bush and Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bush's boat broke down while the President was taking the Canadian 
leader and his family for a ride. A small Coast Guard boat was summoned to 
rescue the party. The boat was repaired overnight.

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council today officially 
announced agreement on a comprehensive political plan for Cambodia and called 
on the Cambodian combatants to accept it in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
In what negotiators called a major breakthrough toward a Cambodian peace 
settlement, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China, all 
of whom have at one time supported one Cambodian faction or another, issued a 
statement saying they had agreed on five "indispensable requirements." 
</P>
<P>
One of the negotiators in the 8-month-old talks, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister 
Igor Rogachev, even held out hopes for a cease-fire in the near future. "If 
everything is going smoothly, it may take a month or two," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not reveal the terms of settlement, which include a major 
role for the United Nations during a transitional stage leading to free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
A key clause, according to diplomats, permits the United Nations to ensure that 
elections are held in a neutral political environment, and if necessary, to 
take control of five key ministries -- foreign, defense, public security, 
finance and information. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeeping and civilian forces are also to supervise disarmament, verify 
a cease-fire, help organize elections and make sure no foreign troops are left 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Cambodians and the full 15-nation Security Council, the new 
U.N. peacekeeping force will be known as the U.N. Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia, or UNTAC. 
</P>
<P>
The document, agreed on by the five, includes five main sections on a 
transitional government, disarmament, elections, human rights protection and 
international guarantees for the neutrality of a future Cambodia.

President Corazon Aquino today rejected as an "insult" demands by rebel 
soldiers for her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's statement came hours after suspected military dissidents exploded a 
bomb at a car sales office once owned by the president's late brother-in-law, 
Ricardo Lopa. 
</P>
<P>
The predawn blast at Mantrade in the capital's financial district of Makati 
shattered glass windows and damaged two cars but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Revolutionary Alliance for the Masses-Soldiers of the Filipino 
People in a statement today called on Aquino to step aside and begin a 
"democratic dialogue" on the future of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"These threats and demands of rebels and traitors are an insult to our people 
and democratic institutions and deserve only the condemnation of our 
freedom-loving citizens," said Aquino, who has crushed six coup attempts.

A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has ordered the closing of the 
101-year-old Hotel Barre, which catered to three Presidents but has been 
operating under Chapter 11 protection since February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee David M. Nickless ordered the shutdown Monday, saying he saw little 
chance of the stately hotel reopening during the liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they would continue to lose money and that would put the 
creditors further in the hole," Nickless said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1899 in a style that suggested a Mississippi River steamboat, the 
three-story hotel had 36 guest rooms, 11 fireplaces and an elegant dining room. 
Guests included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge. 
</P>
<P>
It was sold in 1985 for $265,000 to new owners who re-created its lavish 
Victorian atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has been listed for sale since 1987 for $2.6 million unfurnished, or 
$3.6 million furnished.

The U.S. Postal Service and leaders of its two largest unions opened contract 
talks today as the nation's mail system is undergoing major technological 
changes labor leaders fear will cost employees their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides at the largely ceremonial opening session of the talks spoke 
softly, expressing hope that a negotiated contract could be reached before the 
Nov. 20 expiration of the current pact. 
</P>
<P>
Unions involved in the negotiations include the National Assn. of Letter 
Carriers, headed by Vincent Sombrotto, and the American Postal Workers Union, 
led by Moe Biller. Together the unions represent about 600,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a fair shake and we want an agreement bargained collectively," 
Sombrotto and Biller said in a joint statement at the opening session. "We are 
willing to meet as often and as long as necessary to achieve that end."

About 45,000 municipal workers in at least 10 East German cities walked off 
their jobs for a few hours today in warning strikes for better wages and job 
security in a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses, secretaries, bus drivers, garbage haulers and others stopped working 
for up to two hours, and demonstrations and rallies were held in a number of 
cities. There are about 1.6 million municipal workers in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The workers are demanding job protection and pay increases to compensate for 
higher prices that have resulted from the economic merger of the two Germanys 
on July 1. They also demand that East German income taxes not be immediately 
raised to West German levels.

The Big Apple may be a nice place to visit, but have your wallet handy -- at 
$282 per day, it's the sixth most expensive in the world and far outranks 
domestic competition, a survey said today. 
</P>
<P>
The closest domestic competitor for the dubious honor was Washington, where a 
one-day visit for business travelers averaged $216, according to a survey of 55 
cities prepared by Runzheimer International for Traveler magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A day in town, for the purposes of the survey, meant three meals a day and a 
single room at the standard rate in a first-class hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was ranked sixth in the survey, at $183 per day, with San Francisco 
seventh at $172.

Notre Dame, the first school to negotiate its own television contract with a 
major network, is taking its act to European television. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have reached a tentative agreement to have their football 
games televised in six European countries for three years, beginning this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, terms of which were not disclosed, will allow London-based 
Screensport to use the feeds from Irish games being televised in the United 
States, said Notre Dame Sports Information Director John Heisler. Screensport 
is an all-sports satellite channel that reaches most of northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Irish, whose television rights were held by ABC and ESPN, 
broke from the 64-team College Football Assn. to sign a five-year, 
$37.5-million contract with NBC. NBC will have exclusive television rights to 
Notre Dame's home games for five seasons beginning in 1991.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIVIRAL DRUG CAN EASE HERPES PAIN, AVERT LESIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: When we got married 20 years ago, I had herpes. We were careful, but 
10 years later my husband caught it. 
</P>
<P>
My case has gradually improved to the point that I now have an outbreak only 
every other year. But my husband suffers terribly with an episode at least once 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
Before he came down with genital herpes, we were extremely happy. Since then, 
he has not touched me -- no kiss, no hug, no tender word. He has abandoned me 
emotionally, spiritually, financially and physically. We have separate bedrooms 
and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Herpes has been an unbelievable evil in our lives. Is there any hope for a 
cure? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Although it is unfair, your husband seems to be blaming you for his 
misery. Unfortunately, there is still no cure for herpes, but it may be 
possible for him to control his outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Zovirax (acyclovir) is an effective antiviral medication that can prevent 
lesions when it is taken on a daily basis. These prescription pills have 
revolutionized the treatment of genital herpes. They can also speed healing of 
cold sores or fever blisters caused by herpes 1. 
</P>
<P>
Your husband should discuss his problem with a dermatologist or urologist. In 
addition, both of you would perhaps benefit from marital counseling to help 
overcome the years of bitterness caused by a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Both my daughter and I have had problems with malodorous perspiration. The 
odor is very difficult to launder out of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
We found the solution in Prevention magazine, and want to pass it along. Zinc 
gluconate, 20 mg., prevents smelly perspiration for us. Perhaps others will 
benefit as well. 
</P>
<P>
A. In Germany, zinc compounds are included in deodorants to prevent unpleasant 
smells from sweat. We have been unable to locate any scientific studies 
verifying that oral zinc supplements can have this effect. However, the dose of 
zinc that you are taking is within a safe range, and as far as we know, is not 
likely to cause any complications. 
</P>
<P>
Foods that are rich in this mineral include whole grains, especially wheat 
germ, seafood, brewer's yeast and meat.

Dallas Cowboys first-round draft pick Emmitt Smith, currently a contract 
holdout, has become a crime stopper. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who re-enrolled at the University of Florida last week because the 
contract stalemate has put his NFL career on hold, chased down two students who 
allegedly damaged a Florida player's car. 
</P>
<P>
Smith held the students in a double headlock until campus police arrived, 
Orlando Sentinel columnist Larry Guest reported. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 2 a.m. Saturday. Guest said campus police and those 
close to Smith gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at the athletic dormitory where he is staying with a former 
teammate, Smith discovered two students jumping on the hood of tight end Kirk 
Kirkpatrick's Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
Smith used his car phone to call university police. When the students bolted, 
Smith chased them down a narrow one-way street and past the campus chapel, 
overtaking them behind the women's gym. He took them back to his dorm building 
just as an officer arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The students were cited for trespass and criminal mischief.

NBC'S EARLY FALL PREVIEWS SCORE BIG IN NIELSENS

<P>
NBC took eight of the top 10 spots in the ratings last week, with two of them 
going to previews of new shows for the fall season, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Top of the list, however, went to CBS's "60 Minutes," which was primarily 
devoted to Iraq-related segments. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the first week of Fox's bold ploy of pitting "The Simpsons" 
opposite "The Cosby Show" on NBC, although both shows are still in reruns and 
original "Simpsons" are not expected until October. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cosby" rerun tied for third; the "Simpsons" rerun was in 54th place. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cosby" coattails pulled the preview of "Ferris Bueller" into sixth place, 
the highest-ranked of the new NBC shows being presented in what the network 
calls its "double pump" strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind "Ferris" was "Parenthood" in seventh place, which did much better 
than its lead-in, the preview of "Hull High," which tied for 29th. 
</P>
<P>
"Parenthood" was followed on the air by "Lifestories," which finished in 31st. 
The preview of "Working It Out" was unable to hold onto the lead-in audience 
provided by "Unsolved Mysteries." "Mysteries" tied with "Cosby" for third, 
while "Working It Out" was in 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC numbers crunchers found the network experienced a 12% increase in 
ratings for the week, compared to summer viewing from July 2 to Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"60 Minutes," in first place for the second week in a row, and No. 2 for the 
two weeks before that, drew its audience by using two new pieces related to the 
Persian Gulf crisis -- a report from Steve Kroft on chemical warfare and 
another from Morley Safer on the Soviets and the crisis. The show also aired a 
portion of Dan Rather's interview with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a repeat of Mike Wallace's report on women in military combat. 
</P>
<P>
The news magazine has suffered no summer doldrums -- since Memorial Day "60 
Minutes" has been out of the top 10 only twice. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunday movie battle, CBS was the winner with a repeat of the TV movie 
"Fatal Judgment," which tied for 21st place. ABC's theatrical film, "From 
Russia With Love," tied for 43rd, while NBC's repeat of "I Know My First Name 
Is Steven," Part 1, tied for 51st. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the top-rated show of the week and the top Sunday movie, CBS could 
not beat ABC, whose only entry in the top 10 was "Roseanne" in 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
In ratings for the week ended Aug. 26, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co., NBC 
remained in the lead with a 10.5 rating and a 20 share. ABC was second with a 
9.4 rating and an 18 share and CBS was last with a 9.1 rating and a 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 931,000 households. A share is the 
percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show or network.

The owner of a nightclub is offering refunds to disgruntled customers who paid 
to see the rock band Toto but instead got some stand-ins led by the band's 
former lead singer. The pseudo-Toto was headed by Toto's former lead singer, 
Bobby Kimball, who left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I was slightly deceived by Kimball and his manager," said Larry 
Hurwitz, the owner of the Starry Night club. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Toto's management company said it's not the first time 
Kimball has used the Toto name. "We've gotten reports all over the country, 
from Florida and now the Northwest and Europe," she said. "As far as I know, he 
doesn't own any rights to the name. It's now become a huge legal matter."

<P>
To those who have been there, lived through it and dared to talk about it, the 
very word seems quite inadequate. Depression suggests an indentation, a rut in 
the road or a hole in the earth. It recalls foul moods, bad days, fights with 
the family, economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a catch-all phrase," said William Styron, the novelist and survivor 
of what he would prefer to call madness -- depression that nearly cost his 
life. For such a major illness, Styron said, depression is "a true wimp of a 
word." 
</P>
<P>
For as Styron discovered, true depression swallows its victims entirely, 
devours them in one huge gulp, then spirits them to an otherwise unknowable 
nadir. 
</P>
<P>
"To most of those who have experienced it," Styron writes in "Darkness Visible: 
A Memoir of Madness," a slim volume Random House is publishing this month, "the 
horror of depression is so overwhelming as to be quite beyond expression." 
</P>
<P>
But if there were a single designation for this disorder, a word or a phrase, 
Styron believes it would be something like brainstorm, meaning not some burst 
of intellectual inspiration, but "a veritable howling tempest in the brain." 
</P>
<P>
That is how it felt to William Styron, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of 
"Lie Down in Darkness," "The Confessions of Nat Turner," "Sophie's Choice" and 
other books and plays. At his year-round home in Roxbury, Conn., five years 
ago, Styron's family watched helplessly while he moaned and shouted from his 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"My head is exploding!" Styron cried. "My head is exploding!" 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he entered the psychiatric unit of Yale-New Haven Hospital for 
the treatment he believes saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
White-haired, tall and endowed with the firm physique of a former Marine, 
Styron, 65, can sit on the wide back porch of his white-shingled summer house 
here on the island of Martha's Vineyard and discuss his voyage to a Dantean 
hell with remarkable detachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am a witness," Styron said. There was no way not to address what he 
had been through, he said. His experience with depression "demanded to be dealt 
with in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Shaded from the summer heat, Styron's torpid golden retriever Tashmoo lies 
placidly at his feet, while Dinah, a wired-for-sound black Labrador, comes 
bouncing in from a swim at Black Point Beach to shake saltwater all over her 
adoring master. 
</P>
<P>
Styron and his wife Rose, a poet, have owned this waterfront house for 25 
years. There is a carefully tended flower garden, a large and equally 
well-manicured lawn and a view of the harbor, where, hour after hour, ferries 
chug in with new cargoes of summer visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Styron has his own dock and his own sandy beach. On an island that inch for 
inch boasts as many well-known literary names as the average neighborhood 
bookstore, he is surrounded by good friends and kindred creative souls. Five 
years ago, as he battled the demons of depression, such comforts were of scant 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happened. Five years ago, at 60, Styron's body and mind staged a 
revolt. A legendary drinker, a man who had been able to consume alcohol 
"abundantly, almost mercilessly," Styron became unable to imbibe even the 
slightest quantity of alcoholic spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"My system became unable to absorb even the slightest amount of alcohol," he 
recalled. "I would drink a little wine at dinner, and then all night I would be 
up going to the bathroom." Soon, Styron said, "even a single drink would make 
me feel rotten." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Styron thinks the symptoms had actually begun sooner. "I felt 
maybe that previous spring," the spring of 1984, "that I was having a little 
trouble," he said. "I wasn't feeling too hot." 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, and with their friend Kurt Vonnegut, Styron took a trip to 
Poland. "We were supposed to be doing things with the dissidents," Styron said. 
"But my heart wasn't in it." While Vonnegut and Rose Styron pursued political 
activities, Styron holed up in his hotel room. He felt listless, 
unenthusiastic, unwilling to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there was something happening, a slight aberration in my mind-body 
relationship. I felt it would go away." 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't. With the link to alcohol, the "aberration" was no longer slight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not, and I am not, an alcoholic," Styron said. "But I had a huge 
capacity to abuse alcohol -- and I now realize it was abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Drinking was built into my behavior pattern," he went on. In "Darkness 
Visible" he elaborates, explaining, "I used alcohol as the magical conduit to 
fantasy and euphoria, and to the enhancement of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
But "suddenly," Styron said, "it went away." Just as suddenly, Styron found 
himself faced with trying to "alter the habits of a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Over a beer, a physician whom Styron knew socially offered to write him a 
prescription for medication to help with Styron's sleeplessness. The physician 
had never examined Styron as a patient, and did not ask his weight or age. He 
handed Styron a prescription for a drug called Ativan. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about Ativan," this doctor told Styron, "is that you can take 
as much as you want without ever worrying." 
</P>
<P>
Styron's mood darkened. His body became stooped, like a very old man. On 
Martha's Vineyard, he responded indifferently to the friends and fellowship he 
had previously treasured. "I felt a kind of numbness," Styron writes, "but more 
particularly, an odd fragility, as if my body had actually become frail." 
</P>
<P>
With this sense of physical debilitation came "an immense and aching solitude." 
Styron could no longer concentrate. "The act of writing became more and more 
difficult and exhausting, stalled, and then finally ceased," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over in his mind he heard a line from Baudelaire, "I have felt the 
wind of the wing of madness." 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Styron had written scenes of depression into his novels. In 
"Sophie's Choice," the heroine is assaulted in New York, then takes to her room 
for days. She is unable even to lift her window blinds. This was fiction, 
Styron told himself as he wrote it. But now he shudders at how accurately he 
portrayed the depressive state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"All that was written out of intuition," Styron said. "I had no idea what a 
depressive mood actually was." While he knew on one terrifying level that his 
own center had lost its bearing, "what astonishes me now is that I had only the 
most rudimentary knowledge of this thing called depression. I had no awareness, 
none at all, of the really pathological meaning of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Styron has since learned is that the roots of this disease, 
depression, can run very, very deep. Some cases of clinical depression appear 
to be hereditary. In other cases, they may be linked to childhood traumas. The 
death of a parent in early adolescence seems often to bear on cases of 
depression in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Styron was barely 14 when his mother died of cancer. A year later, his father 
was hospitalized. Styron was not told why, but it now appears his father was 
treated for what was sometimes called "melancholia" -- depression. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to accept this theory, and I tend to do so -- although I do not 
accept every psychoanalytic theory that comes along, I would have to say that 
this is a profound idea, the idea of incomplete mourning," Styron said. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 years after his mother died, Styron wrote "Lie Down in Darkness." It 
begins with the dead heroine, Peyton Loftis, returning in her coffin by train 
to Virginia. In writing that book, Styron said, "I may have been working out 
some of the aggrieved feelings, the pure grief that I had somehow wanted to 
bury." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway down his own personal slide, "I began to see that this was plainly 
depression," Styron said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in his life, he sought psychiatric help. But the 
psychiatrist he calls "Dr. Gold" in his book only warned him that 
hospitalization might ruin his reputation, Styron said. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "I tried to emphasize over and over that what happened to me 
should not be a touchstone for what might happen to anyone else," Styron said. 
Still, "I do not believe that psychotherapy is of any use for serious 
depression," he said. "I think that by that time, the illness has so 
overwhelmed the brain that sitting there for 50 minutes and talking about 
anything at all is a futile exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Styron was switched to another kind of mood-equalizing drug, Halcion. With the 
new medication, Styron's suicidal thoughts grew. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately it was not drugs, not doctors, but good friends and family who 
helped Styron through the murk of his depression. Every day, Styron's friend 
Art Buchwald, a neighbor on Martha's Vineyard, would call Styron to offer 
encouragement. Buchwald also promised Styron that hospitalization would not 
ruin his career -- that on the contrary, it might save it. 
</P>
<P>
As he writes in "Darkness Visible," kitchen knives attained a new allure as 
Styron's suicidal feelings increased. He contemplated inadvertent suicide, 
walking in front of a truck, for instance. His conversation reflected his mood. 
"I kept saying, 'I'm finished,' " Styron said. "I kept using the phrase, 'I'm a 
goner.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks of hospitalization offered him asylum, Styron said. He was taken 
off Halcion, and his suicidal feelings vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"The hospital was a place to get out of the horror of this monstrous daily 
routine, which was getting more and more horrible," Styron said. Removed from 
the pressures of daily life, Styron said that in the hospital, he was able to 
partake of "what may be depression's only grudging favor -- its ultimate 
capitulation." 
</P>
<P>
Styron might never have talked about his experience with depression. But in 
1987, the Italian writer Primo Levi killed himself, joining a long list of 
writers and literary figures who have ended their own lives. One year later, 
Styron became incensed when he read a newspaper account of a symposium about 
Levi, in which the participants seemed almost to blame the Auschwitz survivor 
for taking his own life. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years had passed since his own hospitalization. "Hardly a day 
went by when I hadn't thought about writing something about it," Styron said, 
"I had tried a little fiction," but nothing really worked. 
</P>
<P>
After the article about Levi, "I sat down, and in one afternoon, about 1 1/2 
hours, I wrote 1,000 words. The words just came tumbling out," Styron said, "as 
if they had a sort of precipitating power behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Straight from Styron's soul, those 1,000 words ran as an Op-Ed piece in the New 
York Times. Later, Styron expanded his feelings into a 13,000-word essay that 
ran last winter in Vanity Fair. That piece became the basis for "Darkness 
Visible." 
</P>
<P>
While stressing that he has "no intention of becoming a professional 
depressive," Styron hopes that his book will help broaden understanding about 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend this as an exhortation," he said. "I intended it as a personal 
account of a survivor, from which other people will draw, one hopes, 
sustenance." 
</P>
<P>
Even recalling his own former ignorance about the dimensions of this disorder, 
Styron bridles at the lack of understanding he believes exists about 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, he was taking some physical therapy for a problem with his arm. 
He and his physical therapist were talking "with some loudness" about 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
"From another table, we heard a woman say, 'Depression is caused by self-pity,' 
" Styron said. "I came close to murder. It was one of those idiotic statements 
that I just cannot tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring up this incident because it is not uncharacteristic of this ailment. 
People who are not educated about depression, to one degree or another, are 
ignorant of what the situation is. No one is really able to respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
"You need support, and you need treatment. I don't know what can be said, 
except that there has to be a consciousness-raising effort that allows people 
to know what depression is really about." 
</P>
<P>
Styron is back at work on fiction now, writing longhand and on yellow pads as 
he always does. "Just a short novel" about the Marine Corps and World War II is 
his present project, he said, "nothing omnibus or grand in design or length." 
</P>
<P>
"Darkness Visible" was a catharsis, Styron said, and it was also a service. 
</P>
<P>
"In the back of my mind, a voice, my own voice, was saying, 'You are doing a 
disservice to yourself and to other people if you do not get this down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a compulsion to write this, and so it was done." Styron looked evenly 
out toward the sea. "And I'm very glad it was done."
