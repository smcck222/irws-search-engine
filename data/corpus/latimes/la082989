Australian tabloid king Rupert Murdoch has been accused of trying to change the 
face of journalism. Now he's changing bodies, too. 
</P>
<P>
This week's issue of Murdoch's TV Guide features a very slim Oprah Winfrey in a 
gauzy dress sitting on a pile of money alongside the headline, "Oprah! The 
Richest Woman on TV?" 
</P>
<P>
But TV Guide admitted Monday that the portrait is actually a composite. The 
head is Oprah's while the body belongs to actress Ann-Margret -- a circa 1979 
Ann-Margret at that. 
</P>
<P>
It's just the kind of stunt the magazine condemns each week in its "Cheers 'N' 
Jeers" section. 
</P>
<P>
TV Guide, purchased by Murdoch's News Corp. last year, acknowledged that the 
illustration could be mistaken for a photo. But David Sendler, one of the 
magazine's editors, added: "Ann-Margret should be thrilled because she's got 
another TV Guide cover. And Oprah should be thrilled because she looks 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey, who appears to have regained some of the 67 pounds she lost in a 
well-publicized diet last year, was on vacation and couldn't be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Winfrey spokeswoman Christine Tardio, said: "Oprah had no part in it 
whatsoever. . . . Oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that." 
</P>
<P>
Ann-Margret apparently wasn't thrilled, either. TV Guide said its artist used a 
publicity still of her from a decade-old TV special for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was shocked," said her publicist George Kirvay. "If you look at 
the two pictures, they're identical. It's even her ring on Oprah's hand." 
</P>
<P>
The revelation comes just a week after a TV Guide article on television shows 
asked the question: "Who's Got Egg on Their Faces?" 
</P>
<P>
Greeting cards measuring 4-by-6-feet were personally delivered to the homes of 
four county supervisors over the weekend. But the senders, members of Social 
Services Union Local 535, weren't in a festive mood. 
</P>
<P>
The cards repeated the union's demand for a limit on the number of cases 
involving abused children and adults that can be assigned to each county social 
worker. Local 535 vows to go on strike Oct. 3 if no limit is agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
The only supervisor to escape the deliveries was Pete Schabarum, whose house no 
one could find. 
</P>
<P>
At the residence of Supervisor Deane Dana -- who wasn't home -- the visitors 
tied balloons bearing the message "Put a Cap on Caseloads" to bushes in the 
front yard. A Dana spokesman said that the supervisor's wife, Doris, "wasn't 
happy about having her flowers bothered" or about the footprints left behind in 
the garden.

Every summer, a group of bicyclists meets by the reflecting pools of the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power building, where they fill up test tubes 
that they later empty into Mono Lake 350 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
It's an event with "good visuals" for the media. But the symbolic protest 
against the DWP's drainage of Mono -- now at its lowest level in years -- isn't 
dear to the heart of the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing, though. The tenth edition of the event, called the Los 
Angeles-to-Mono Lake Bike-a-Thon, didn't make its usual splash when it kicked 
off Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP has drained the pools for what it terms scheduled repairs. "There is no 
tie-in," a DWP spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 or so bicyclists brought their test tubes anyway.

GLOBAL TEAMWORK AT SUNDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A glimpse of what it is going to take to soften the blows that billions of 
humans and their machines deliver to their Earth each day emerged from a 
mountain retreat in Utah last week. 
</P>
<P>
One thing it will take, at a minimum, is cooperation on environmental problems 
among nations and peoples who have little in common, at least politically, 
except for the planet they live on. After three days of meetings, more than 200 
Soviet and American scientists, politicians, businessmen and others concerned 
with the environment urged their governments to get together on the task of 
stopping the Earth from overheating due to the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
They asked President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to form an 
"environmental security alliance." As Roald Z. Sagdeev, one of the Soviet 
Union's top space scientists and an elected member of his country's new 
parliament, the Supreme Soviet, put it: "The issue of global survival should be 
elevated to the level of nuclear survival." The group was brought together by 
actor Robert Redford at his retreat in Sundance. 
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse effect results from an envelope of carbon dioxide and other 
gases -- created largely by the burning of fossil fuels -- that has sealed 
itself around the planet and is trapping warm air, which historically had 
cooled off in outer space. Scientists agree that the warming trend is real. 
What they do not yet know is how high temperatures will rise and how much 
flooding those higher temperatures will cause along the earth's shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundance meeting was the sort of thing that David McClave of the Library of 
Congress urged in one of a series of papers that the Johns Hopkins Institute 
published last year. The Soviet Union is the world's largest country and the 
United States the fourth largest, so the way that they manage their 
environments has an effect on people far beyond their borders. 
</P>
<P>
That would be particularly true of the greenhouse effect, according to 
McClave's statistics, because they account, between them, for 40% of the carbon 
dioxide created by burning fuels that makes its way into the greenhouse 
envelope. 
</P>
<P>
A glimpse of barriers to global cooperation on the environment also emerged. 
Sagdeev, for example, said that many Soviet citizens don't see how global 
warming could hurt the frozen regions of Siberia with food production so 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Third World nations do not look kindly on what they see as moves by the 
industrial world to throttle back on energy production just as the Third World 
seems poised to catch up in such luxuries as refrigeration and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But a separate report from Sundance also made it clear that the world has no 
choice but to try. "Soviet and U.S. scientists agreed that continued buildup of 
greenhouse gases at present rates will ensure that global temperatures rise 
before the middle of the next century above anything in human history."

Dennis McDougal's story ("Lynwood: Downhill on the Freeway," Part I, Aug. 20) 
was timely, interesting and certainly pointed out the major changes occurring 
in our region. 
</P>
<P>
Although he focused on Lynwood, the former All-American city, other areas have 
also undergone major changes. Overbuilding and clogged streets have all 
contributed to an erosion of the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
I hope we will see more stories from The Times on changes in our cities and 
areas.

Last year, Lynwood commissioned Hintz &amp; Balvin Communications to create a 
video history of the city so that youngsters and newcomers could appreciate 
where they are living. In the process, we got to know Lynwood as a city of 
people who are friendly and care about their city. 
</P>
<P>
The camera crew created curiosity and people on the street were terribly 
pleased to be the focus of a positive piece on their area. The video gathered 
together Lynwood old-timers and newcomers in a project that they could all be 
proud of -- The City of Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
We concluded that Lynwood seems to have a special sort of strength and staying 
power. It lives strongly in people's happy memories of its past but even more 
strongly in the current residents' determination to create there a new 
All-American City.

The story of Lynwood stirred emotions throughout South Pasadena. Dennis 
McDougal's nostalgic account of Lynwood was a testament to the devastation that 
freeways can pose. 
</P>
<P>
McDougal pointed out that Lynwood was not affluent like . . . Beverly Hills and 
South Pasadena. Sir, our town is far from affluent. Our city operates on a 
small budget. Our property values may have gone up, but our budget has not. 
</P>
<P>
It was our old-timers who started pressuring Caltrans to come up with 
alternative solutions, and it is our young people who continue. It's in their 
hearts, not their pocketbooks. Like Lynwood, we are an "All Nations" city that 
not only appreciates our rich 101-year history, but welcomes the diversity that 
our changing demographics bring. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the moral of McDougal's story should be that not all freeways are 
created equal, some must never be built. People and towns are more important.

PROPOSITION 13 HAS MADE EVERYONE'S TAX REASONABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN M. COUPAL, Jonathan M. Coupal is an attorney with the 
Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation, which has participated in numerous 
lawsuits in support of Proposition 13. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 13 has always had its critics. Lately, however, the criticism has 
been more widespread. Even some policy analysts who generally favor limited 
taxes and less spending have complained of an "inherent flaw" in Proposition 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Because Proposition 13 uses acquisition value (usually the purchase price) as a 
basis of taxation, it is possible for owners of identical side-by-side 
properties to have significantly different tax bills. In short, the system 
generally favors those who have owned their property longer. 
</P>
<P>
To understand why Proposition 13 is fair, one must understand how it works. 
Proposition 13 curbs property taxes by restricting the maximum rate (1%) and, 
more important, by limiting increases in assessed valuation (2% annually). With 
the latter provision, it is easy to see how a home's current market value can 
greatly exceed its taxable value over a span of just a few years. 
</P>
<P>
The substantial difference between a property's actual value and its taxable 
value disappears when the property changes hands. When this occurs, county 
assessors reassess the property at full market value. Thus, recent purchasers 
derive no immediate benefit from the limitation on annual increases in taxable 
value. 
</P>
<P>
So is Proposition 13 fair, even to recent home buyers? Yes. It treats equally 
property owners who purchase property of similar value at the same time. Unlike 
any other tax system in the country, it provides absolute certainty to 
homeowners as to what their tax bills will be in all future years. It prevents 
a homeowner's taxes from skyrocketing as a result of the vagaries of the real 
estate market -- something over which they have no control. Instead, the amount 
of property tax liability will depend almost exclusively on the voluntary act 
of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Proposition 13's adoption by the voters in 1978, the California 
Supreme Court recognized its inherent fairness. Justice Frank K. Richardson, 
speaking for a nearly unanimous court, concluded that "an acquisition value 
system . . . may operate on a fairer basis than a current value approach." 
</P>
<P>
The fairness of Proposition 13 also becomes apparent when one looks beyond the 
concept that property taxes should always be based on current value. 
Admittedly, Proposition 13 is unique. However, as a matter of law and policy, 
there is nothing requiring property taxes to be confined to a system that 
arguably has more inherent unfairness to it than does Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Once people discard their preconceived notions and view Proposition 13 in 
isolation, they will be surprised at how much sense it makes. Think of 
Proposition 13 as being a hybrid between a property tax and a sales tax. After 
all, if sales taxes can be based on acquisition value, why can't property 
taxes? Even Justice Richardson noted that Proposition 13 introduced a tax 
system "roughly comparable" to a sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Critics might concede that Proposition 13 provides absolute tax certainty and 
yet still assert that the system is flawed because owners of similar property 
may be paying different tax amounts. The response to this is that it should be 
no concern whatsoever to a new resident what his neighbor's tax is -- as long 
as his or her own tax is reasonable. The absolute cap of 1% imposed by 
Proposition 13 makes everyone's tax reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complain that owners of similar properties are paying different 
amounts for the same public services. However, this is no more unfair than the 
traditional method of taxation under which owners of more valuable property pay 
more for the same services. This entire argument ignores the nature of taxes. 
If we were that concerned with proportionality between the amount of tax and 
the level of service, we would resort to a system of nothing but user fees. 
Because proportionality between tax liability and services has never been an 
attribute of property taxes, it is unfair to level this charge against 
Proposition 13 alone. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 is certainly fair to existing property owners because it bases 
tax liability on acquisition value, not on the mercurial real estate market. It 
is fair to local governments because it allows for periodic reassessment of 
property when it changes ownership (and under other circumstances as well). Few 
people realize that total property tax revenues to local governments in 
California have increased at a rate exceeding inflation and virtually all other 
economic indicators. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Proposition 13 is fair to new property owners, because it gives them 
two things they otherwise wold not have: the benefit of a reasonable maximum 
property tax of 1% and the absolute certainty as to what their tax bills will 
be in future years. In light of skyrocketing property values, this is not a 
minor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
On the charge of "unfairness," Proposition 13 must be judged "not guilty."

CHANGING CLIMATE AMONG SUPERPOWERS MAY AID THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. MUSTO, David F. Musto, a professor of psychiatry and the history of 
medicine at Yale School of Medicine, is the author of The American Disease: 
Origins of Narcotic Control (Oxford University Press, 1987). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hopeful event in the long struggle against international narcotics traffic is 
the decline in Cold War tensions. Why this is so can be seen from the curious 
history of attempts at narcotics control. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting narcotics has never been the highest priority in international 
relations, even for the United States. International narcotics policy floats on 
a sea of great- power relationships and goals. In the last 40 years the most 
persistent obstacle to controlling the supply of opium has been the Cold War, 
which divided the world into suspicious and hostile camps. Opium production 
flourished as the growers played off one power against another or were 
themselves used in the pursuit of the higher priority of national scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty years ago the United States started the world anti-narcotic movement by 
calling for, then chairing, the Shanghai Opium Commission. The commission was 
made possible by an unusual coincidence of anti-narcotic sentiment in Britain, 
China and the United States. A slightly different mixture of events and timing 
and there would have been no meeting. Building on the commission's expression 
of concern, the United States next called for and chaired the Hague Opium 
Conference. There, the first treaty intended to control narcotics was completed 
in 1912. America fulfilled its Hague Treaty obligations by passing the Harrison 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
Few governments, even among those who attended these pioneer meetings, shared 
America's firm conviction that any non-medical use of narcotics was wrong and 
should be strictly prohibited everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Little progress was made during World War I to add to the nations ratifying the 
treaty. After the war ended, several nations, including the United States, 
conceived the ingenious idea of putting the Hague Treaty into the Versailles 
Treaty. As a result, ratification of the Versailles Treaty required a nation to 
enact domestic narcotic controls within 12 months. It was this requirement, 
rather than any heroin or opium problem, that was responsible for the British 
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1920, so often touted as having "solved" a drug problem 
by providing heroin by prescription. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of widespread ratification of the Hague Treaty and the assumption of a 
narcotics-control oversight role by the League of Nations, consensus remained 
elusive. First, the United States refused to join the league. Then, in 1925, 
the American delegation walked out of the Geneva Opium Conference convinced 
that other nations did not sincerely wish to end the traffic in narcotics. When 
the United States finally resumed cooperating in the 1930s, war in China and 
then the outbreak of World War II intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Within the first 40 years of attempting to control narcotics, therefore, the 
convergence of circumstances that made possible the beginning of the 
international movement never reached the success anticipated. Although treaties 
were written, bureaucracies established and many meetings held, the 
comprehensive control of narcotics was never achieved. Narcotics use fell in 
the United States between the two world wars chiefly due to reduction in 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the vicissitudes of international relations are the key to an 
effective control of narcotics, the prospect of lowered tensions between the 
United States, the Soviet Union and China is the most optimistic combination of 
events since the Shanghai gathering in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
These three great powers -- bitterest enemies for long stretches since World 
War II -- are among the most intolerant of drug use. Joint efforts in this area 
could devastate the opium growers along the southern rim of the Soviet Union 
and China as well as persuade each nation that it would obtain great domestic 
benefits through cooperative action. Whether this will happen depends, as 
usual, on the course of larger events. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's suppression of the student democracy movement is an 
example of how unexpected events could derail cooperation. On the other hand, 
Cuba's crackdown on cocaine smuggling as the Soviets begin to withdraw 
financial support of the Fidel Castro regime is an example of how alteration of 
traditional Cold War relationships can surprisingly improve the prospects for 
drug control. 
</P>
<P>
As the originators of the international anti-narcotic movement, we ought to be 
the nation most aware of how difficult the attainment of that goal is. 
Recognizing the difficulty of controlling narcotic supply in the absence of 
great-power cooperation, we should be modest in our expectations for 
interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Our drug problem may once again be curbed by the gradual reduction in demand, 
not by relying on the extinction of supply. Indeed, the recent National 
Household Survey of Drug Abuse confirms other signs that middle-class drug use 
is declining. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is tempting to speculate on what would happen to narcotic supplies if 
Cold War tensions continue to subside. Then the time will come for a second 
meeting at Shanghai.

CENTENNIALS JOIN COWBOY CHIC WITH MODERN SCHLOCK

The sound is the thing that gets to Jim Reinartz most, that creaking, rhythmic 
"crunch, crunch, crunch" as the wheels of his antique horse-drawn wagon rattle 
across gravel roads and rut-covered fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Hear that rumble?" the one-time rodeo star asked wistfully. "When I was a kid 
we always had steel-wheel wagons and that's what it sounded like. That's 
probably the way it sounded back when the pioneers crossed the prairies, too." 
</P>
<P>
Zigzagging across his native South Dakota on a summer-long commemorative wagon 
train, Reinartz is wallowing in the biggest nostalgia craze that has hit the 
Great Plains since Custer began wishing he'd taken that desk job after all. 
</P>
<P>
Both South and North Dakota, as well as Montana and Washington, are celebrating 
statehood centennials this year with a smorgasbord of rodeos, parties, hoedowns 
and historical hoopla that combine the best of cowboy chic and the worst of 
American schlock. 
</P>
<P>
Already this summer, South Dakota's party animals have taken part in everything 
from the Schmeckfest (don't ask) in Freeman to the Farkleberry Festival in 
Hayti and the Ugly Horse and Road Apple Roulette contests in Philip. All the 
while they've been snapping up a cornucopia of souvenirs, from the ubiquitous 
T-shirts and mugs to official centennial quilts, doilies, windsocks, rifles, 
beef jerky, wine and mixed nuts. There is also an official centennial record 
album with official centennial songs recorded by an official centennial 
troubadour. 
</P>
<P>
Up in Montana, the Red Lodge Grizzly Peak-a-boos not long ago tossed a 
Centennial Can-Can revival, a historical review featuring the world-renowned 
Cow Capitol Kickers and actors re-creating famous Montanans of the past, 
including somebody named Liver Eat'n Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
And over in North Dakota, in addition to the Fargo Fire Festival, the 400-mile 
centennial challenge bicycle race and the modestly titled Bismarck "Party of 
the Century," officials seriously debated whether to rename the state simply 
"Dakota." 
</P>
<P>
Backers said the state should enter its second century unencumbered by the 
modifier "North," which evoked an image of a frigid, uninviting climate that 
could turn off investors and visitors alike. Nevertheless, Montanans, whose 
favorite pastime after raising cattle is ridiculing North Dakotans, voted in a 
newspaper-sponsored centennial contest to suggest that their neighbor to the 
east rename itself "Manitscolda." 
</P>
<P>
The official centennial booby prize, if there was one, would probably be 
awarded to President Bush, who flew to Bismarck in April to preside at the 
planting of an official centennial tree, a 12-foot American elm. However, North 
Dakota state forestry experts discovered that the White House gift was infected 
with fast-spreading, tree-killing gypsy moths. The tree had to be sprayed with 
pesticide before Bush could plant it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indian Leaders Unhappy 
</P>
<P>
Although almost every town and service club from Anamoose, N.D., to Zillah, 
Wash., has cooked up some festivities to commemorate the centennial, not 
everyone has been overjoyed. Some, but by no means all, Indian leaders have 
refused to participate, claiming that statehood in these parts only intensified 
an assault on the culture and rights of Native Americans. The Lakota Times, an 
Indian-oriented newspaper based in South Dakota, urged in an editorial that 
Indians wear black armbands and fly their tribal flags at half-staff to 
illustrate their attitude toward the centennial. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious events of the year have been a pair of wagon trains that 
have already traversed thousands of miles of South Dakota's flat landscape. And 
up in Montana, organizers are working on the final arrangements for a massive 
60-mile, five-day-long cattle drive kicking off on Labor Day from Roundup, the 
trail head where turn-of-the-century cattle barons once gathered herds for 
their trek to market. 
</P>
<P>
In South Dakota, by the time the wagon riders circle up for the last time at 
the state fair in Huron next week, more than 500 different covered wagons and 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of saddle riders will have joined up for at least 
part of the 3 1/2-month-long trek across the state. Officials in Montana expect 
as many as 5,000 head of cattle, a few thousand riders on horseback and up to 
250 wagons to take part in their drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wild, Wild West 
</P>
<P>
But organizers of the centennial events have discovered that, no matter how 
hard they try, it's impossible to faithfully recreate the Wild, Wild West. For 
starters, a century ago nobody in Montana had to worry about environmental 
impact statements, land easements, right-of-way leases and paramedics when they 
trailed cattle. Participants are expected either to contribute cows to the mass 
herd or, at the very least, "rent" a few as the price of admission. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kuzara, the logistics coordinator for the cattle drive, said the biggest 
headaches come in trying to herd people, not cows. "It ain't the way they did 
it in 'Lonesome Dove,' " said Kuzara. "Getting the Porta Potties out there, the 
water and the food and all that kind of stuff. We're basically moving a town of 
3,000 people every day." 
</P>
<P>
The finale to the drive will be different. More than 200 cowboys on horseback 
will be standing guard to keep livestock from getting spooked and stampeding 
through department stores, yogurt shops, banks and fast-food franchises as the 
herd trails down Main Street in Billings, Montana's largest metropolis. 
Bringing up the rear will be a sanitation squad with sweepers and water hoses 
to clean up after the cows, no respecters of today's urban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20th-Century realities have also set in on the wagon train, covered by 
liability insurance that cost $28,000 in premiums. The old wagons that brought 
settlers across the prairie were quaint but not all that comfortable. Many of 
the new breed of wagoners have outfitted their rigs with rubber tires to 
cushion the bumps. They also have coolers for refreshments and stereos, tape 
decks and walkie-talkies to help pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touch of Commercialism 
</P>
<P>
And surely nobody a hundred years ago ever traveled in a rolling billboard. 
Many of today's wagons are covered with ads: "Norwest Bank," "Zip Feeds," 
"Coors Official Centennial Beers," "Aaladin Cleaning System," "Pulling for 
Christ." And one vehicle, propelled by double horsepower, asks the question, 
"Have you driven a Ford lately?" 
</P>
<P>
Even with a touch of commercialism, however, the response that the wagon train 
has evoked in the sparsely populated towns that dot the landscape shows that 
old-fashioned values of generosity and neighborliness are still very much alive 
in South Dakota. Onlookers gather by the dozens along remote highways to watch 
the wagons rumble slowly by. Many others grab their horses and trail along for 
a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
At almost every town along the way, residents greet the riders with a lavish 
potluck supper or barbecue lunch. In June, about 1,500 turned up in Labolt when 
the train passed through, quite a crowd for a community with a population of 
only 90. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Wessington Springs, about 1,000 people flocked to the city park the 
other night, their arms filled with casseroles, Jello molds, cakes and brownies 
galore. After the meal, town fathers gave awards to the riders, then everyone 
joined hands to sing hymns and say prayers. The next morning, Mary Lynch and 
Babe Dooley drove over from Woonsocket, about 15 miles down the road, to pass 
out homemade cinnamon buns to the riders as they rolled out of their sleeping 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everybody has a different reason for making the trip. Don and Stella 
Kraft, both long ago widowed, were getting married and wanted to do something 
different 
</P>
<P>
for their honeymoon. Sally Baker, who grew up on a sheep station in the 
Australian Outback, wanted to see some place that was, by her standards, 
crowded -- though not too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Newhoff, at 80 the oldest wagon driver, just wanted an excuse to get out 
of his house back in Iowa and see how things had changed in his native South 
Dakota since he moved away in 1938. "There wasn't any fences and there weren't 
any paved roads back then," said Newhall, who grew up on a ranch 55 miles from 
the nearest town. "There were these huge herds of cattle and they had horns. 
Even Dad was afraid to walk very far on foot because the cattle could get 
around you and just gore you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simpler Way of Life 
</P>
<P>
For Jim Reinartz, who still owns the ox yoke his great-grandfather used to 
drive a team here from Illinois in the early 1880s, the 1989 version of a wagon 
train symbolizes the last gasp of a simpler, happier way of life. 
</P>
<P>
"You sit here and you watch the feet on the horses and you watch the ground and 
you're going slow and the road just hypnotizes you," said Reinartz, clutching 
the reins of a team of tan-colored Belgian horses. "I haven't looked at my 
watch in three days. Time doesn't mean anything out here. Next year, I'm going 
to get me a team and a wagon and a radio and some beer and just drive up and 
down the ditches someplace."

LITHUANIA WARNED BY GORBACHEV; 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENCE BID HAS GONE TOO FAR, LOCAL LEADERS TOLD

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, abandoning his policy of strict 
non-interference in the way local party leaders deal with nationalist 
activities, interrupted his Black Sea vacation to warn Lithuanian Communist 
Party officials that the independence drive in that Baltic republic had gone 
too far, an activist said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was made in a telephone call to Lithuania's party leader, Algidas 
K. Brazauskas, and then passed on to local leaders of Sajudis, the Lithuanian 
independence movement, the activist said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, the Soviet Communist Party, at loggerheads with increasingly 
strident nationalists across the country, accelerated its campaign against 
independence movements, striking out at Moldavia, where the republic's 
Parliament is to consider a law today that would make Moldavian the official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harder Line 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Soviet leadership has sought to influence citizens of the various 
republics with words alone. But in recent days, the words have become tougher, 
and some analysts say the Kremlin may be laying the groundwork for direct 
intervention -- possibly the arrest of nationalist leaders or a shake-up of 
local party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev spoke by telephone Sunday to Brazauskas, a Brazauskas aide said, 
declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sajudis, Romaldus Ozolus, said Brazauskas met Monday with 
Sajudis leaders and told them that "Gorbachev is concerned about what's 
happening in Lithuania -- that what had happened so far was worth supporting 
but that now we'd gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Soviet party had taken a conciliatory stance as the republics 
felt their way under Gorbachev's policies of openness and reform. For example, 
the Kremlin stood by quietly as language laws similar to the proposed Moldavian 
measure were enacted earlier this year in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muted Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Kremlin generally refrained from criticizing the popular 
front movements formed in many republics to give ethnic minorities a political 
voice. The aim was to persuade leaders in the republics that they could achieve 
their goals without seceding from the Soviet Union, a step that is permitted, 
in theory, by the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But now, clearly feeling threatened by growing cries for independence, Moscow 
has decided to speak out decisively against the nationalist moves. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow has changed its tactics and seems to be preparing the way for harsher 
actions against nationalists," one Western analyst said, forecasting a possible 
shake-up of Communist Party bosses in some of the more active republics. 
</P>
<P>
But the analyst said the Soviet leadership will probably delay any major action 
until after the Supreme Soviet, the national Parliament, convenes next month. 
</P>
<P>
"To act without some kind of a mandate would seriously undermine Gorbachev's 
reform program internally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennebunkport, Me., where he is on vacation, President Bush appeared to send 
a signal to the Soviets advocating restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feared that recent hard-line statements could presage a crackdown 
against opposition groups in the Baltics, Bush declared: "I hope not." In a 
brief question-and-answer session with reporters, he went on to praise the 
restraint and "understanding" that Gorbachev had shown in his response to 
developments this month in Poland, where the first non-Communist government in 
the East Bloc since World War II was formed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the change in Moscow's mood was reflected Monday in an article in 
Pravda, the official organ of the party, which lashed out at supporters of the 
language law in Moldavia and warned that if deputies there pass such a law, 
their votes would signal support for "ethnic strife, the isolation of Moldavia 
and disruption of its ties with other republics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nationalist Hysteria' 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television accused leaders of the independent popular front movement in 
Moldavia of whipping up "nationalist hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
The article in Pravda and the television report followed a party Central 
Committee statement Saturday night -- the first sign of the new tough stance -- 
warning that nationalists in the Baltic states are pushing the region toward 
the precipice. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist activists in the Baltic republics have said they will not stop 
their independence campaigns, but they acknowledge that the position taken by 
the Central Committee is cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are trying to do is run our own affairs and speak our own language in 
our own country, and they call us extremists," Janis Jurkens, a spokesman for 
the Latvian popular front, said. "We are very worried that the tanks may roll 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Moldavians, in a movement led by writers, have organized periodic 
demonstrations since March, calling on the republic's legislature to enact a 
law that would make the Romanian-like language official and replace Cyrillic 
script with the Roman letters that were used before the Soviet Union annexed 
the region in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300,000 at Rally 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Moldavians demonstrated Sunday in the capital of Kishinev. Other 
rallies took place Monday, according to Soviet television, which said the 
Moldavians chanted "No to the Russian language!" 
</P>
<P>
Moldavians complain that their language has been reduced to a "kitchen-table 
language." Before the Gorbachev era, people who spoke it ran the risk of being 
labeled anti-Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavians make up about 64% of the republic's 4.2 million people but are 
outnumbered in many major cities, where Russian is widely spoken. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, in an article headlined "Twenty-Four Hours to Decide," warned that 
Moldavia's citizens are being "blinded by nationalism." It said that activists 
from Moldavia's popular front movement are "people who, hiding behind the 
screen of reform, are pursuing personal ambitions and are trying to gain power 
on the crest of a dirty wave of chauvinism and separatism." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also took aim at local Communist Party officials. It said the 
secretary of the republic's Communist Party Central Committee, Ivan T. Gutsu, 
and his followers "are not giving a proper rebuff to these nationalist 
sentiments." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have, "in an amazingly unanimous effort," criticized ethnic 
Russians who have been striking for a week to protest against the proposed 
language law, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party officials in Moldavia, the Baltic republics and others where 
ethnic strife has erupted are caught in a dilemma, however: The Kremlin has 
said that unless they win local elections, they may face ouster from the party; 
but to win elections, they must appeal to their constituents by echoing the 
growing nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ethnic Russian who is a spokesman for the Moldavian strike 
committee, identified by Pravda as P. Skrepchenko, told the newspaper there 
would have been no strike if leaders of the republic had agreed to recognize 
Russian as the inter-ethnic language while making Moldavian the official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were just ignored," Skrepchenko said. "Neither the Moldavian Communist 
Party Central Committee nor the Supreme Soviet understood our anxiety." 
</P>

A FAMILY TORN;

<P>
SURVIVORS TRY TO COMPREHEND LOSS

<P>
The sound of women wailing came out of the small yellow stucco house in East 
Los Angeles on Monday morning. A family birthday party had become a family 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Maria Navarro's estranged husband, Raymond, 26, had burst 
into her birthday party uninvited and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Now Maria, 27 to the day, was dead. Her aunt Francisca was dead. Elderly aunt 
Maria was dead. The close friend they called aunt Leticia was dead. Aunt Berta 
was in the hospital, barely alive. 
</P>
<P>
Maria's three children and their cousins had witnessed murder. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, brothers and grown nephews poured gallons of bleach onto the driveway, 
trying to scrub away the blood with brooms. Not satisfied, they added detergent 
until suds flowed down the driveway pure and white. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Family 
</P>
<P>
At last, the stains were gone. But the fabric of a large and close family had 
been torn. For 25 years, despite the fact that part of the family had lived in 
Mexicali and part had lived in Los Angeles, they had remained extremely close. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, relatives arrived at the modest home in the 3600 block of Lanfranco 
Street from both sides of the border. For several hours, all they knew was that 
four women were dead and one was barely alive. But, in the confusion, they 
didn't know who. All they knew was that no matter how it turned out, there 
could be no sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Porque? Porque? (Why? Why?)" cried Delia Fajardo when she arrived in Los 
Angeles from Mexicali Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she screamed: "Mi hija! Mi hija! (My daughter! My daughter!)" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps none lost more than Delia Fajardo. She was the mother of the slain 
young woman, the niece of the two elderly women who were dead, Maria Garcia, 
69, and Francisca Arizpe, 62, and sister to Berta Galvan, 47, who was in 
critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. Another woman who was so close 
to them all that they called her tia, or aunt, Leticia M. Dipp, 47, was also 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Francisca and Berta were not married, relatives said. Neither, they said, was 
Dipp, whom the family had adopted as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Berta was like a second mother to Maria," said Fajardo, who spoke briefly to a 
reporter about her daughter before collapsing in tears. "I had always asked 
Berta to look after Maria." 
</P>
<P>
And Berta did. Especially after Maria Navarro had separated from her husband in 
early 1988, following complaints that he had physically abused her. Berta would 
stop by the house asking if there was anything Maria and the children needed. 
Often, she gave them money. 
</P>
<P>
They worked together too, along with Leticia Dipp, at the Plaza del Sol 
shopping center in East Los Angeles. Dipp was manager of the shopping center. 
Maria, in recent months, worked two jobs to make more money for her three 
children, Claudia, 7, Denise, 6, and Raymond Jr., 5. Berta wore a security 
guard's uniform but never carried a gun, co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
The three women were strong and strong-willed, merchants and employees at the 
shopping mall said Monday as they tried to absorb the shock of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"The three women ran the place," said Carmen Cortez, an administrator at the 
Latino Immigration Service. "We feel lost without them. They would help 
everyone. They were strong ladies. . . . Those ladies weren't afraid of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Maria was pretty, the kind of young woman whom strong aunts felt they needed to 
protect, particularly from her jealous husband, friends and relatives said. 
They described Raymond as jealous and abusive, a man who prided himself on his 
weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Sweethearts 
</P>
<P>
He had married his Roosevelt High School sweetheart. A few years ago, friends 
said, Maria had been a contestant in the Miss Primavera contest in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, she had come to fear her husband. Her aunt Berta grew more 
protective. 
</P>
<P>
"Berta used to come with her because they were afraid of him," said Carlos 
Hernandez, owner of Sandwich Express at the shopping center. Maria worked from 
about 4 a.m. to noon at International Tour Service, a shuttle bus line between 
Los Angeles and Tijuana, as a receptionist. After she got off that job, she 
would go to work as an assistant to her aunt Leticia. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said Berta had told him she came to work at 4 a.m. with her niece 
because they were afraid of her husband. Once, he said, Raymond Navarro had 
followed her upstairs at the mall, kicking her. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her (Maria) once, 'Why don't you leave him?' " he said. He said she 
answered: " 'Because if I leave him, he would kill me.' That's what she told me 
about six, seven months ago."

CREW OF RUNAWAY TRAIN RECALLS DETAILS OF FATAL DERAILMENT IN MAY

<P>
A "helper engineer" riding in the back of a train that derailed and killed four 
people here in May said Monday that he decided on his own to apply emergency 
brakes because "something was obviously wrong" and immediate action was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a move is typically the responsibility of the lead engineer, 
Lawrence Hill said the train's speed had reached 40 m.p.h. and was mounting and 
"corrective action had to be taken -- the sooner the better." 
</P>
<P>
The emergency brakes failed to stop the runaway, and the Southern Pacific 
freight derailed minutes later on a curve at the foot of the treacherous Cajon 
Pass grade. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was one of three surviving crew members who testified Monday at a hearing 
convened by the National Transportation Safety Board. Thirty-three witnesses 
will be called during the weeklong hearing, which is part of the board's 
investigation of the May 12 derailment and the explosion 13 days later of a gas 
pipeline that runs alongside the railroad tracks and was buried under tons of 
train wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the back-to-back tragedies killed six people, injured 31 and 
destroyed 17 homes. More than 1,000 residents were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing provided the first public remarks from the crew of the 
ill-fated train, which was headed for Long Beach with 69 hopper cars full of 
sodium bicarbonate, a sandy material also known as trona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frightening Ride 
</P>
<P>
The three provided accounts of their frightening ride down the 22-mile grade at 
speeds up to 105 m.p.h., as well as technical details that the safety board 
will incorporate into an accident report to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
Head engineer Frank Holland, who was riding in the lead locomotive with 
conductor Everett Crown, who was killed, said he braced his feet against the 
heater as the train entered the curve where it would derail, plunge down an 
embankment and crush a row of homes. He said he was thrown to the floor when 
the train left the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"All I remember was a lot of dirt and glass," said Holland, who suffered broken 
ribs and a collapsed lung in the wreck and has not returned to work. "Then I 
stood up and my window was gone. It all happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the search for a cause has spotlighted the inaccurate weight of 
the carloads of trona that was provided to crew members before they left 
Mojave. Holland of Bakersfield testified that he "had no reason to doubt" 
documents telling him the train's load was 3,000 tons lighter than it actually 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Erroneous Rate 
</P>
<P>
Holland said he maneuvered his train and made decisions about the appropriate 
speed and brake applications based on that erroneous weight. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, who had never before piloted a trainload of trona and was 
relatively new to the Cajon Pass route, also was handicapped by his belief that 
at least four of his six locomotives had complete braking capability. In 
reality, only three were fully operable. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hill, at the rear of the train, was aware from the trip's start that 
the brakes on at least one of the locomotives were inoperative, he failed to 
tell Holland. Investigators repeatedly questioned Hill about that Monday, 
suggesting that it was an oversight that contributed to Holland's inability to 
stop the train. 
</P>
<P>
But Hill doggedly maintained that using the radio to inform Holland of the bad 
brakes was not his responsibility and said, "I figured (Holland) already knew 
from the dispatcher who sent the (helper locomotive) up." 
</P>
<P>
Holland was vigorously questioned about his use of air brakes -- one of two 
primary braking systems on a train -- during the long descent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a Southern Pacific guideline advising an engineer not to release more 
than half of his available air supply to apply brake shoes, Holland did just 
that part way down the hill. The maneuver is discouraged -- and now illegal 
under railroad rules -- because it takes a long time to regain a full supply of 
air and thus regain full braking power. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, however, said he believed that the move would help him slow the train, 
noting that it had worked for him before. 
</P>
<P>
Also under scrutiny was Holland's failure to reverse the engines in a 
last-ditch effort to stop the train, or possibly derail it before it reached 
residential neighborhoods. The engineer testified that he had not been trained 
to take such a step and that "it wouldn't have made any difference anyhow."

11.2% INSURER PROFIT STANDARD COULD RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of the state Insurance Department's Rate Enforcement Bureau told a 
legislative hearing Monday that the 11.2% annual profit standard that Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has set for the insurance industry is only a 
"tentative" figure and may be revised upward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply our opening position," Reid McClaran told the hearing in Los 
Angeles chaired by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), head of the Senate's 
Insurance Committee. "We understand the companies will ask for more and in some 
cases much more. We'll have to see what our administrative law judges say at 
the rate hearings and the commissioner will then reach a final decision." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, at a San Francisco news conference, Gillespie had stated her 
adoption of an 11.2% standard in much more categorical terms, calling that 
percentage a "fair rate of return" for the companies based on the average rate 
for all U.S. property casualty insurers during the years 1973 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, who had been scheduled to appear at Monday's hearing to face down 
her persistent critics, Voter Revolt chairman Harvey Rosenfield and state Board 
of Equalization member Conway Collis, did not show up. Deputy Commissioner 
Charlene Mathias told Robbins that the commissioner had suffered a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Seek Subpoena 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he felt Gillespie might be ducking the hearing because she did not 
want to answer questions. He said he would give the commissioner four 
alternative days to agree to appear and, in lieu of her agreement, would seek a 
legislative subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing in Gillespie's absence was marked by scathing criticism of her 
alleged lack of diligence in implementing Proposition 103 by Rosenfield and 
Collis, sharp questioning by Robbins and replies by Mathias, McClaran and other 
department officials that fueled their anger. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, for example, when Gillespie would go forward with rate rollback hearings 
for 219 companies that she had put on a "slow track" hearing process, the 
department officials not only refused to set any dates but said it is possible 
in some cases that no hearings will ever be held. 
</P>
<P>
McClaran said that for many of these companies, including State Farm Mutual, 
the state's largest seller of auto and homeowner insurance, Gillespie is still 
waiting for information she has requested from them. When she receives the 
information, McClaran said, she could decide to exempt them from the 20% rate 
rollback called for by Proposition 103 without any hearing. Department critics 
say a hearing is required by law. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Milo Pearson, chief of the department's Rate Regulation 
Division, disclosed under questioning that the department has quietly abandoned 
its challenge to a 9.6% average rate increase that State Farm implemented 
earlier this year. He said the challenge had been rendered moot by the state 
Supreme Court ruling in May upholding Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, meanwhile, questioned whether Gillespie will run for insurance 
commissioner when the post becomes elective next year as she has indicated. He 
said he heard that someone in the Deukmejian Administration has told her in 
recent weeks that there will be another preferred Republican candidate, perhaps 
state Sen. John Doolittle (R-Citrus Heights). 
</P>
<P>
Asked through her press secretary about Robbins' suggestion, Gillespie referred 
the matter to Kevin Brett, Gov. George Deukmejian's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Brett called Robbins' comments "political fantasy," remarking that ever since 
Deukmejian ran for governor in 1982 against much of the Republican 
Establishment, "the governor has been very resistant to kingmaking. He doesn't 
enjoy it, and he doesn't engage in it. This case is no exception."

PACT WOULD GIVE HOSPITALS MUCH OF TOBACCO TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Senate and Assembly negotiators reached general agreement Monday on a complex 
plan to give county hospitals the largest share of the roughly $600 million a 
year raised from the voter-approved tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The six members of a Senate-Assembly conference committee did not take a formal 
vote on the plan but indicated they were in basic agreement on most elements of 
the proposal. Gov. George Deukmejian must still sign off on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Should the basic agreement hold up, it would represent a financial bonanza for 
Los Angeles County and other financially strapped counties that have been 
hard-pressed to deal with the closing of hospital emergency rooms and for 
growing numbers of Californians who cannot afford to pay for their own health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, counties are in line for more than half the money that is 
earmarked for health services under the 1988 ballot measure, Proposition 99, 
which increased cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack and required comparable 
hikes in other tobacco taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Between $323 million and $338 million would be set aside to defray county 
hospitals' costs in providing health care for the working poor -- those with an 
income too high for welfare but too low to buy health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. We think the Legislature has been listening to us and is in 
the mood to help," said Karen M. Coker, a lobbyist for the County Supervisors 
Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Undecided 
</P>
<P>
Despite the consensus that is forming, a number of important issues remain to 
be decided. Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), who is carrying the 
legislation to parcel out the tobacco tax revenue, said after a morning session 
that "we have decided generally how to spend 90% of the dollars, but we have a 
lot of remaining tough issues." 
</P>
<P>
Although counties are in line to receive the money, lawmakers still must decide 
what kind of formula will be used to distribute the funds and how counties will 
deal with declining Proposition 99 funds in future years. Since the beginning 
of the year, tobacco tax revenues have declined 10%, a drop attributed to the 
higher cost of cigarettes because of the tax increase. Counties are concerned 
about legal problems that may arise in the future if they are forced to cut 
their budgets because of declining tobacco tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Another open issue is how much money -- if any -- will be put into an 
anti-smoking media advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers say they hope to reach a final agreement in time to enact the 
legislation before the Legislature adjourns for the year Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, conference committee members are making decisions on about $900 
million -- $294 million from the last six months of the 1988-89 fiscal year, 
which ended June 30, and $603 million expected during the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 mandated that the money be used to subsidize the costs of 
medical treatment for those unable to pay for their own treatment, pump dollars 
into research programs, fund an anti-smoking campaign and finance natural 
resource programs. 
</P>
<P>
The measure required that 20% of all money raised through Proposition 99 go to 
health education programs, 35% to hospital programs, 10% to doctors, 5% to 
research and 5% to natural resources, with the remaining 25% to be free to be 
divided up any way the Legislature chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Although the initiative spelled out in general terms how the money was to be 
divided, it was vague on a number of key points. For example, it did not spell 
out whether public or private hospitals were to get the money and did not make 
clear which government entity should be responsible for administering the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Isenberg bill is considered the most important of numerous measures 
introduced to implement various elements of Proposition 99. Other bills are 
more narrowly focused, dealing with issues such as setting up anti-smoking 
education and research programs and parceling out the money for parks and 
natural resource projects.

Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the Jewish settlement movement in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, went on trial Monday on charges that he 
killed a Palestinian shopkeeper a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Levinger, spiritual leader of the settler movement Gush Emunim, or Faith Bloc, 
pleaded innocent to manslaughter charges in the death of Kayed Salah, 42, in 
the West Bank town of Hebron on Sept. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that after reporting at an army post that his car was 
stoned, Levinger returned to Hebron and opened fire on Salah at a distance of 
12 yards. Levinger has said he fired in the air during the stoning to defend 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 30-minute court session, Levinger and a group of supporters 
demonstrated outside the home of Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini, shouting 
that Husseini should be detained as "the biggest terrorist" in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
During the protest, Levinger handed Husseini a copy of a fake identity card 
drawn up by the settlers that gave his occupation as "terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
Husseini was freed by the government last January after spending most of the 
past 20 months in jail. He was held without charge or trial under Israel's 
administrative detention regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Palestinians died of gunshot wounds suffered in clashes with 
Israeli forces, and a third, suspected of collaborating with Israel, died of 
injuries from a beating by fellow Arabs.

Nine people were killed and 25 were wounded when Israeli fighter planes raided 
bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) militia in southern Lebanon, 
Hezbollah sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the militia, many of the casualties in the Sunday evening attack 
were civilians hit when a school housing displaced families was flattened in 
the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the southern port city of Sidon said the attack on 
Hezbollah strongholds at the Shiite Muslim village of Bouswar was the first 
since Israel abducted Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a leader of Hezbollah, from a 
southern Lebanon village July 28. Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella 
organization for a number of Shiite terrorist groups holding hostages in 
Lebanon, including Americans, other Westerners and three Israeli soldiers.

An underground extremist faction threatened Monday to kill Pope John Paul II if 
he comes to Lebanon on a peace mission. 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the threat by the previously unknown Organization for the 
Defense of the Oppressed suggested that it was made by Shiite Muslim zealots. 
</P>
<P>
Delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut, the statement said: "To His 
Holiness Pope John Paul II: We address our words to him, wishing that he writes 
his will before he comes to Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"The organization emphasizes that His Holiness the Pope will be one of the 
victims of the criminal war our beloved homeland Lebanon is living through," 
the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Muslim groups have said that a Lebanese peace mission by the Roman 
Catholic leader would really be intended to boost the Christian side in the 
country's 14-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Shiite cleric, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, was quoted 
Sunday as saying he would welcome the Pope and "give him full security 
guarantees" to visit Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said it is studying the possibility of a visit to Lebanon, but no 
date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the extremist group also said "it will arrange a reception 
for the Pope of Rome similar to our reception of the Israeli invaders and the 
forces of (former President) Reagan and the 'loving mother' (France) in 1982 
and 1983." 
</P>
<P>
That last reference was to twin suicide truck bombings on Oct. 23, 1983, that 
killed 241 American soldiers and 58 French troops in West Beirut. The attacks 
prompted the withdrawal of an international peacekeeping force from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
France, which ruled Lebanon from 1918 to 1943, often is referred to as the 
Christians' "loving mother," mainly because it helped forge a national covenant 
that guaranteed key government posts, including the presidency, to Christians 
after independence. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Christian community is smaller than the Muslim population.

PEACE TALKS ON CAMBODIA STALL AS PULLOUT NEARS

Less than a month before Vietnam's troops are scheduled to withdraw from 
Cambodia, the main parties in a Paris peace conference seeking a political 
solution to the 10-year-old guerrilla war are deadlocked on several major 
points, the French foreign minister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the 19 countries taking part in the monthlong conference, 
including the United States, hold out little hope for an agreement before the 
Vietnamese withdrawal is to begin Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the conference was to avoid civil war by establishing a 
stable political base in Cambodia before the estimated 60,000 to 70,000 
Vietnamese troops are withdrawn, as promised, by Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concluding Session 
</P>
<P>
However, representatives of the three resistance factions and the government in 
Phnom Penh have failed to reach agreement on five main points, French Foreign 
Minister Roland Dumas said Monday at the opening of the concluding three-day 
session of the talks. The unresolved points, he said, are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The role of the United Nations -- specifically, the use of a U.N. 
peacekeeping force during the withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How to bring about a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whether to use the word genocide in reference to the 1975-79 rule of the 
Khmer Rouge, a period in which more than 1 million Cambodians died. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The status of Vietnamese "settlers" who have gone into Cambodia since the 
invasion by Vietnamese forces in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The relationship of the four main political elements in a proposed 
government of national conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
The last point is regarded as the most sensitive because it involves 
determining the role of the Khmer Rouge in an interim government. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former ruler who now heads a three-party rebel 
alliance, argues that the Khmer Rouge, which has the most effective fighting 
force in the resistance movement, cannot be excluded if the country is to avoid 
civil war after the Vietnamese are gone. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hun Sen, prime minister of the present government, is unbending in his 
opposition to Khmer Rouge participation. 
</P>
<P>
"Prince Sihanouk will not be able to play a political role in Cambodia unless 
he first abandons the Khmer Rouge," Hun Sen said Saturday in an interview with 
the Paris daily Le Monde. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk over the weekend announced his resignation as head of his party, but 
he continued to represent the three-party alliance at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
China, the main supporter of the Khmer Rouge forces in Cambodia, insists on 
Khmer Rouge participation. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper asked Monday in an editorial: "Why is 
it that a faction that has resisted Vietnam's aggression for years cannot join 
in the government and exercise power?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Anticipation 
</P>
<P>
When the peace talks opened at the start of this month, the presence of U.S. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar reflected widespread anticipation of a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of these leaders will be on hand when the conference concludes 
Wednesday, a fact that was noted bitterly Monday by Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Baker's absence, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"That shows that he will only come when the rice is already cooked. Does he 
really want to help us reach an agreement?"

The Nicaraguan navy has seized two U.S.-owned fishing boats for lack of proper 
documentation and is detaining the vessels and their crews at the port of 
Bluefields, the State Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The vessels, carrying a total of eight crew members, were identified as Pete's 
Dream and the Pescadora, but their home ports were not given. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures were carried out last Wednesday, State Department spokesman 
Richard Boucher said. U.S. Embassy officers who have visited the Americans

CONTRA LEADER FERREY RETURNS TO NICARAGUA AFTER 6 YEARS IN EXILE

Resistance leader Roberto Ferrey returned home to Nicaragua on Monday after six 
years in exile and pledged to fight to improve conditions for democracy in the 
period leading up to next February's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey told reporters that his return did not necessarily mean that he is 
quitting as a Contra director, a position he only recently assumed, or that he 
had dropped the idea of a military solution in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided for now to take part in the political process inside 
Nicaragua, which means to fight to improve the conditions that so far exist 
within Nicaragua," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey said he will not join any of the 21 opposition parties in Nicaragua but 
will work within the National Opposition Union (UNO) to beat the governing 
Sandinistas at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
He said that there are still rebels ready to go back to war and that he would 
seek to change conditions inside Nicaragua to make it more attractive for them 
to give up their fight and come home. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan agreed upon by five Central American presidents Aug. 7 in 
Honduras, the U.S.-supported Contras will have three months to abandon their 
Honduran bases starting Sept. 6. They will either have to return home or go to 
countries other than Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey said a major problem is the continuing detention of thousands of 
relatives of the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we going to tell a combatant to come back when his relatives, friends 
and supporters are still in jail?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Sandinistas are using the release of certain prisoners as a 
campaign ploy and called this "immoral and deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey was last in Nicaragua in May, 1988, as a negotiator for the 
Sandinista-Contra pacts worked out in Managua.

A federal judge Monday granted a government request to narrow a conspiracy 
charge in the Iran-Contra indictment against former National Security Adviser 
John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold E. Greene agreed to drop allegations of a conspiracy 
by Poindexter and others to illegally divert funds to the Contras from the 
Ronald Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining in the indictment are allegations that Poindexter conspired to 
obstruct Congress, make false statements and destroy official documents in the 
Iran-Contra scandal. His alleged co-conspirators were former White House aide 
Oliver L. North and businessmen Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim. North 
enlisted Secord's help in supplying arms to the Contras during a congressional 
ban on military aid to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter also is accused of two counts of obstruction of Congress and two 
counts of making false statements to Congress. Those counts also relate to 
denials that North was assisting the Contras.

A federal district court judge ruled that Occidental Chemical Corp. can be held 
liable for punitive damages at Love Canal, as well as for compensation for 
cleaning up the toxic chemical dump. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, released Monday, sets the stage for additional trials on whether 
other parties must share Occidental's liability and on how much the company 
will pay in damages, a spokeswoman for state Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Curtin ruled that Occidental must take liability even though it sold 
the property to the Niagara Falls school board in 1953 with a warning that the 
land had been used as a dump. 
</P>
<P>
The board's purchase price was only $1. "The company palmed off what it knew to 
be an enormous toxic waste site for $1. Today's decision puts the liability 
back on Occidental's shoulders, exactly where it belongs," Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is the successor to Hooker Electrochemical Co., which dumped wastes 
into the abandoned water ditch from 1942 to 1953. Hundreds of people were 
evacuated after the wastes began bubbling up more than a decade ago.

TV NETWORK FOR STATE GOVERNMENT URGED

Contending that television news coverage of state government is 
"embarrassingly" inadequate, an independent organization called California 
Channel on Monday proposed a new government-affairs TV network, focusing 
chiefly on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting a system similar to the C-SPAN television coverage of Congress, the 
group called for installing cameras in the chambers and hearing rooms of the 
Assembly and Senate and broadcasting sessions live and by unedited tape to 
cable TV stations statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, control of the cameras -- considered a critical element -- 
would be in the hands of the Legislature. Actual broadcast by satellite of 
legislative actions to television stations would be handled by an independent 
operator. California Channel offered itself to fill that role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Funding 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, taxpayers, foundations and corporations would provide the 
financing, ranging annually from $3.8 million for a bare-bones operation to 
$13.5 million for a "large-scale operation" on the air 12 hours a day. Later, 
according to the plan, private contributions would be replaced by cable 
subscriber fees as popularity of the coverage increased. 
</P>
<P>
The concept received a warm reception from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). But other leaders took a wait-and-see stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd definitely like to see us do it," Brown said. "I think the public 
literally needs more information about what goes on in the Legislature. Money 
could be a problem. We'll have to look at that closely." 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who plans a Sept. 20 hearing of 
the Senate Rules Committee on the plan, said there "seems to be a lot of 
interest" in televising legislative proceedings. But Roberti said he wants to 
sample public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra said through a spokeswoman 
that he had no position on the California Channel proposal. "The Legislature 
will put together its own proposal if it decides to do this," said Anne 
Richards, his press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
If the Legislature agrees to televise itself, concerns of the minority party, 
in this case the GOP, must be satisfied because virtually any money voted for 
the program would require Republican support for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just exploring possibilities," remarked Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles), chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The network could be ready for testing late next year, the report said. The 
report resulted from a two-year study, prepared in large part by the Annenberg 
School of Communication at USC. 
</P>
<P>
During Ronald Reagan's governorship in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, several 
television stations from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco posted 
full-time news teams in Sacramento. Television budget decisions eventually led 
to the closure of all out-of-town TV news bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeds to Stations 
</P>
<P>
However, Northern California News Service provides daily feeds by satellite to 
a dozen television stations in the state and two in southern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
In a report co-authored by Tracy Westen, an assistant professor at the 
Annenberg School, the California Channel charged that California's public 
affairs coverage by television "is an embarrassment compared to that of other 
jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
The report said that in only Wyoming and Montana does the public get less 
television coverage of legislative affairs than in California. In six states, 
the report said, gavel-to-gavel coverage is available. 
</P>
<P>
"Inadequate electronic media coverage of state government undermines the 
quality of representative government in California and contributes toward a 
high level of ignorance on the part of the state's citizens," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Koplin, executive director of California Channel and a former official of 
Californians Against Handgun Violence and former marketing director of New 
Perspectives Quarterly magazine, said that in addition to legislative coverage, 
the new network also could cover arguments before the state Supreme Court, 
hearings of state government agencies and selected city council debates with 
statewide interest. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Mallory, operator of Northern California News Service for television, 
objected to the report's conclusion that television is ignoring the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"They flat out say television has abandoned the Capitol and that is bull," he 
said. "We have subscribers from San Diego to the Oregon line, in all the major 
markets. Stations who never before got daily coverage from the Capitol now are 
getting it."

COURT UPHOLDS ACCESS OF STATE TO PAYROLL DATA

The California Supreme Court, upholding the power of state regulatory agencies, 
ruled Monday that an employer's payroll records may be obtained by labor 
investigators and used against him in a criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-3 decision, the court, sharply divided on constitutional issues, 
rejected contentions that an employer may prevent use of such information as a 
violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
An employer has no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents -- such as 
time and wage records -- that the law requires the employer to keep, the court 
said in a majority opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative subpoena may be issued for such data when it promotes a 
"legitimate regulatory aim," is not directed at inherently criminal activity 
and requires only "minimal disclosure" of information customarily kept by 
business, Eagleson said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices overturned a state appeals court decision in February, 1988, that 
struck down as unconstitutional an administrative subpoena issued by the state 
Division of Labor Standards Enforcement seeking records from a Seal Beach man 
suspected of failing to pay overtime to attendants he employed to care for an 
ailing relative. 
</P>
<P>
State labor officials, appealing to the high court, warned that the appellate 
ruling could seriously impede investigations by numerous state regulatory 
agencies and have a "disastrous effect" on their ability to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was welcomed by H. Thomas Cadell, chief counsel for the state 
Department of Industrial Relations, as affirming the ability of regulatory 
agencies to gain vital information from employers.

TAUNTING AT BORDER PROBED

<P>
The U.S. Border Patrol in San Diego will begin an inquiry into an incident late 
Sunday in which an agent taunted hundreds of undocumented immigrants for more 
than an hour with slurs amplified over his vehicle's public address system. 
Michael D. Gregg, supervisory patrol agent, said the patrol would "look into" 
the taunting, which was witnessed by journalists and occurred Sunday evening 
along the Tijuana River in San Diego, a major crossing point for those seeking 
to enter the United States from Mexico without documentation. The incident 
comes at a time when Border Patrol officials have maintained that they face 
increasing threats of violence from hostile crowds of would-be immigrants who 
mass along the border each evening, occasionally harassing the agents verbally 
and pelting them with rocks. Less than two hours after the taunting was 
overheard, a Border Patrol agent near the same area shot and wounded a 
15-year-old Mexican boy who patrol agents say was about to hurl a rock at 
another agent.

22 SLAIN ON TRAIN IN INDIA

Twelve masked Sikh militants armed with automatic rifles stormed aboard a 
passenger train at a remote station in northern Punjab state and massacred at 
least 22 Hindu passengers, a police official said. Director General K.P.S. Gill 
of the Punjab police said at least 30 Hindus were wounded in the attack, 10 
seriously. The English-language Tribune, published in Chandigarh, Punjab's 
capital, put the toll at 70 dead and 150 wounded. Police blamed the Khalistan 
Commando Force, one of the most hard-line groups fighting to create a Sikh 
nation called Khalistan, for the attack in Kabrawana, 125 miles south of the 
Sikh holy city of Amritsar.

The campaign to replace the late Claude Pepper in Congress wound down with a 
poll by WSCV-TV in Miami showing a virtual dead heat between Republican Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen and Democrat Gerald F. Richman. If she wins today's special 
election to fill the 18th Congressional District seat held for 27 years by 
Pepper, Ros-Lehtinen, a state senator, would become the first Cuban-American 
voted into Congress. In the survey of 301 likely voters, Richman, a Miami Beach 
lawyer, received 47% of the vote, while Ros-Lehtinen had 45% and 8% were 
undecided. The poll carried a margin of error of 5 percentage points. Among 
black and Jewish voters, Richman's support neared 80%. Among white non-Latino 
voters, he enjoyed a 2-1 edge. Ros-Lehtinen drew support from 86% of Latino 
voters.

President Bush recommended a 3.6% pay raise for 1.6 million white-collar 
federal employees, higher than the 2% he originally requested. In a message to 
congressional leaders from his vacation home in Maine, Bush said the larger 
increase is necessary to attract qualified people to government service, but 
added that budget constraints prevent him from backing the 28.6% raise a 
federal commission said was needed to make federal and private-sector pay 
scales comparable. The 3.6% raise would be effective Jan. 1, 1990, for all 
non-postal workers earning $82,500 a year or less. Bush is expected to extend 
the increase also to senior executives.

SAN JUAN MAYOR UNITED SOUTH O.C. OFFICIALDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When Gary Hausdorfer was elected to the San Juan Capistrano City Council more 
than a decade ago, it seemed that the vast rolling hills, pristine beaches and 
parochial city politics of South Orange County would last forever. 
</P>
<P>
But sprawling development and traffic congestion ended that bucolic dream years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
So Hausdorfer, who is now mayor of the 28-year-old beach city, created the 
South Orange County Leadership Conference, a loose-knit group of elected and 
administrative officials who began meeting in January. 
</P>
<P>
The informal group, made up of 21 public agencies south of the convergence of 
the the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, will soon have a charter and bylaws 
and will be electing a board of directors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a unified voice on some of the most important issues affecting South 
Orange County," Hausdorfer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With a sixth city now being considered in the area and local population growth 
expected to double by 2010, city officials can no longer limit their dealings 
with each other to chamber of commerce mixers and occasional luncheons, said 
Hausdorfer, the organization's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of the potentially influential body is another indication that 
officials in the fastest-growing area in the county are flexing their political 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is already poised to oppose a proposed airport, offshore 
drilling and a jail in South County, Hausdorfer said. The group recently 
sponsored a round-table discussion on immigration and undocumented workers. The 
discussion included officials from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, the Orange County Sheriff's Department and other county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point Councilman Mike Eggers said, that as a result of that discussion, 
his city passed an ordinance prohibiting job solicitation on the streets. The 
City Council also approved opening a telephone hot line to match workers with 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unusual political entity," Hausdorfer said. "There doesn't seem 
to be anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified School District Supt. Jerome Thornsley said the school 
district has often found it frustrating to meet separately with councils of the 
four cities in the district and develop meaningful policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for effective communication between agencies is very great and 
very much needed," Thornsley said. "This (organization) seems to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point's Eggers agreed: "While we may not ever reach a unified consensus on 
a subject, we can at least benefit from the sessions." 
</P>
<P>
During the organization's first meeting on Jan. 27 topics thrown out for 
discussion included child care, the environment, traffic congestion and air and 
water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleasantly surprised," Hausdorfer said. "It is good government when 
there is interaction." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Hausdorfer said, "there was limited contact at best" among members 
of the only three city councils then in existence in South Orange County, 
Hausdorfer said, and almost no contact with local school board members. 
</P>
<P>
"We either kept in contact (about local issues) as an 
'inform-as-needed-to-be-informed basis,' or not at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But it increasingly seemed odd that there was no way for local officials to 
exchange ideas on a regular basis, especially when the area began to grow and 
add more political bodies. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Mission Viejo and Dana Point have joined San Clemente, 
Laguna Beach and San Juan Capistrano as cities. Laguna Niguel residents will 
vote on cityhood in November. And pro-cityhood residents in Laguna Hills and El 
Toro are considering another campaign next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It just started to dawn on me," Hausdorfer said this week, "that there was no 
forum for us to just get together and talk about issues that affect us all in 
South Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The organization should complete the charter process when it meets in 
September, Hausdorfer said. At that time, he said, members would elect a board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
He said that initially he did not want to formally establish the organization. 
"We have enough government. We really don't need any more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fee Dictated Change 
</P>
<P>
But after asking members to pay a $500 annual fee, he learned that a charter 
was a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Capistrano Unified School District expressed concern about 
handing public funds to a private organization that lacked legal status, 
Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to be careful," Thornsley said. So he wrote Hausdorfer and 
suggested that the legal documentation be drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Community College District Chancellor Richard Sneed said growth in 
the area has made such a forum necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what some of the cities were doing," Sneed said. "We all really 
and truly owe a debt to Mr. Hausdorfer for calling us all together."

COUNTY SAYS IT'S TOO LATE TO HEAR REMAPPING SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warning that court intervention would force postponement of next June's 
election for two seats on the Board of Supervisors, Los Angeles County asked a 
federal judge Monday to throw out a lawsuit alleging that the county's 
redistricting plan discriminates against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed in U.S. District Court, county attorneys argued that it is too 
late for the court to act on the suit without delaying the election, when 
Supervisors Ed Edelman and Pete Schabarum, who represent heavily Latino 
districts, are up for new four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys said that election workers must begin preparations in 
September, and the trial is not likely to be concluded until late January. 
</P>
<P>
After the June election, county attorneys argue, the suit would be moot because 
the board must redraw their district boundaries in 1991 anyway, after the U.S. 
Census. 
</P>
<P>
"They have run out of time," Senior Assistant County Counsel Mary Wawro said, 
referring to the plaintiffs. Wawro said U.S. District Judge David Kenyon could 
delay the election, but she said she would argue against a postponement because 
it could force some voters to wait up to eight years to cast ballots in a 
supervisors election. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court redistricts the county before the 1990 election, a significant 
number of voters who otherwise would be entitled to vote in 1990 will be 
shifted to districts whose elections are not scheduled until 1992," said the 
papers filed by the county. "Because redistricting again will be required in 
1991, the lines then may be redrawn in a manner that places some of these 
voters back in districts" where the next election would be 1994. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eve of Court Hearing 
</P>
<P>
The county's request came on the eve of the court hearing on the county's 
appeal of a ruling requiring the supervisors to disclose their private 
conversations leading up to adoption of the 1981 redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
In their 1988 lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department and two civil rights groups 
accused the supervisors of drawing their districts in such a way as to preclude 
the county's 2 million Latinos from electing a Latino to the five-member board. 
Citing the federal Voting Rights Act, the suit seeks a realignment of the 
existing districts or expansion of the board to create a Latino majority 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The legal director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
one of the plaintiffs in the case, accused the county Monday of trying to delay 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Speculation 
</P>
<P>
"It's based purely on speculation," legal director E. Richard Larson said, 
referring to the county's claim that the case cannot be decided before the June 
election. "As such, it is a frivolous motion. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is plenty of time to try the case," Larson added. He said 
Kenyon could extend the Dec. 31 deadline for completing preparations for the 
election and, if necessary, could delay the election and order a special 
election upon completion of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit remains relevant, even if the June, 1990, election is held, Larson 
said. "We would have some legal precedent behind us in drawing of new lines in 
1991, and hopefully we would deter the county from doing what they did in 
1981," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But in their court papers, county attorneys blamed the plaintiffs for delays. 
"Plaintiffs idled through four rounds of elections under the 1981 plan. Then, 
seven years after that plan was adopted, they initiated (the) suit."

FRATERNITIES LOSE COURT BATTLE WITH CITY OF FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON and CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Fullerton scored a decisive victory Monday in its struggle to tame 
unruly fraternities when an Orange County Superior Court judge upheld an 
ordinance requiring that all fraternity and sorority houses obtain special 
operating permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Three Cal State Fullerton fraternities challenged the ordinance, contending 
that it was unconstitutional because it restricted their rights to assemble and 
to privacy, among others. However, Judge Betty Lou Lamoreaux disagreed, ruling 
that the city acted reasonably in trying to protect a neighborhood from loud 
parties, litter and other problems stemming from the fraternity houses. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that these fraternities are a public 
nuisance," Lamoreaux said in her decision and ordered the fraternities to seek 
a permit within 60 days or close down. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which was issued at Harbor court in Newport Beach, came as a 
disappointment to fraternity members, who contend that their groups have been 
unfairly held accountable for rowdiness on the part of other college students. 
</P>
<P>
"The university was built in this neighborhood and so there will always be 
students around here," said Eric Gustafson, 23, past president of Sigma Pi, one 
of the fraternities involved in the legal dispute. "A lot of (students) live in 
apartments around here, but because we have the logo on the house we get blamed 
for all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Talmo, lawyer for the fraternities, said he would be meeting with his 
clients to discuss whether to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials were pleased by Lamoreaux's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"To have our conditional use permit ordinance upheld is an important decision 
for the Fullerton community," Mayor Molly McClanahan said in a written 
statement. "Now we can get on with all fraternities taking responsibilities for 
their action and bringing their houses up to code." 
</P>
<P>
The legal flap started in 1986, when Fullerton added fraternities and 
sororities to the list of those required to seek a conditional use permit that 
states various rules under which houses can remain open. City officials also 
cited several fraternities for building code violations. 
</P>
<P>
The actions followed a decade of complaints from residents of an 
apartment-dominated neighborhood north of the campus that is home to seven 
fraternity houses. 
</P>
<P>
By the Jan. 1, 1988, deadline for applying for such a permit, all but three 
fraternities had complied: Sigma Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Tau Kappa Epsilon. 
The university's five other fraternities and six sororities were granted 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the permit, the city can impose certain rules upon a fraternity or 
sorority, such as how many people could gather at one house or where members 
should park. The fraternity members who fought the permit requirement 
maintained that these conditions amounted to constitutional violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Considered Family 
</P>
<P>
Talmo also argued that the fraternities were like families and therefore should 
be exempt from the ordinance. But Judge Lamoreaux ruled that Fullerton's 
ordinance "in no way prevents plaintiffs from associating with each other" and 
said that previous court cases have established that fraternity members do not 
constitute a family. 
</P>
<P>
Lamoreaux concluded by writing that she sees no reason a fraternity cannot 
remain in the neighborhood as long as the group is willing to "keep noise at a 
reasonable level, avoid loud music after 10 p.m., police contacts, illegal 
parking, large group activities, litter, trash, blocking of streets and 
trespassing on private property of the neighbors in the vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
Sigma Alpha Epsilon president Craig Holdener doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of partying and drinking; it's an abridgment of our rights," 
said Holdener, 22. "They make us park two blocks away. . . . We're residents of 
this neighborhood, and we should be able to park here like anybody else."

WORKMAN DIES IN CONCRETE TOMB; 
</P>
<P>
FRANTIC EFFORTS TO SAVE VICTIM FAIL; 13 INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One construction worker -- buried alive in freshly poured concrete -- was 
killed and 13 other workers suffered leg and back injuries Monday when the 
decking collapsed on the ground floor of an apartment building under 
construction in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
James Ziola, 29, of Canoga Park was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, where he was taken after 15 Los Angeles County firefighters, racing 
frantically against time with shovels and their bare hands, dug him out from 
under two feet of wet concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Ziola, submerged in the mud-like concrete for almost an hour, had been in the 
building's subterranean garage checking the steel posts that shore up the 
decking when the collapse occurred shortly after 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bursting dam, more than 10 tons of concrete and seven tons of metal 
reinforcement rained down on the underground garage, causing 25 workers atop 
the decking to flee in terror. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 injured workers, rushed by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai, Midway and UCLA 
medical centers, were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse began with "a loud snap," said Steve Buckles, a concrete pump 
operator. "Then I saw the men start to scurry to the edge of the deck." 
</P>
<P>
One of those men was Claude Numa, 44, a concrete finisher who suffered a neck 
injury in addition to bruises and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
"In a flash, the whole section collapsed," said Numa as he awaited medical 
treatment at the scene. "I was running, trying to get out of the way when I 
fell over the heavy pieces of steel sticking out of the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Another injured finisher, Traveon Adams, called it "the scariest thing I ever 
saw. I knew someone was below. We always have someone checking the shoring. I 
can't believe it happened." 
</P>
<P>
In all, 13 engine companies with more 100 county firefighters went to the 
building site in the 900 block of North Doheny Drive, a neighborhood of 
low-rise apartment buildings two blocks south of the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
As a small crowd of local residents looked on, the firefighters, with 
helicopters circling overhead to provide assistance if needed, worked 
feverishly to free the dying victim. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziola, who witnesses said had gone under the decking to check a possible 
shoring problem, suffered massive head and chest injuries and could not be 
resuscitated, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the scene were at a loss to explain why the decking gave way, 
saying that the site had been inspected by the West Hollywood Building and 
Safety Department as recently as Friday. Moreover, four county-registered 
private inspectors hired by the general contractor, Homestead Building 
Construction Co. of West Los Angeles, were on hand when the 60-by-40-foot 
section of decking collapsed, West Hollywood Public Information Officer Helen 
J. Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't happen very often," said Buckles, 31, of Downey. "Usually, when 
they fall it's the first thing in the morning because we start at the edge and 
maybe the edge will let go a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it just falls a little bit and they get down under there and shore it 
back up," added Buckles, employed by a subcontractor for the four-story, 
41-apartment project. 
</P>
<P>
Homestead officials were not available for interviews Monday but they released 
a one-paragraph statement saying that "the job has always been maintained in 
accordance with applicable safety and construction requirements." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office, in conjunction with county 
firefighters, sheriff's deputies and West Hollywood city officials, immediately 
launched a criminal investigation to determine whether there were safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Homestead 
was cited for 19 non-criminal safety violations at building sites in Los 
Angeles during a two-year period from April, 1985, to March, 1987. Four of the 
19 violations were classified as "serious," meaning they carried fines, a 
Cal/OSHA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, the company was cited for performing excavation work without 
adequate safety measures and for failing to properly guard floor, roof or wall 
openings. In November, 1985, it was cited for failing to provide railings on 
all open sides of scaffolding, ramps and elevated platforms. And in March, 
1987, Homestead was cited for repeating a "serious" violation of failing to 
place proper railings around stairways under construction, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 construction workers die each year across the nation, but such 
fatalities are relatively rare in Los Angeles, which has only about 25% of the 
construction accidents and deaths of other major cities, said Joseph Kinney, 
executive director of the Chicago-based National Safe Workplace Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1986, he said, there were 21 construction fatalities in the 
city of Los Angeles, compared to 83 in New York. Construction workers 
experience the highest rate of injury of any major work group, Kinney added. 
"One of every six construction workers can anticipate being injured and 
temporarily disabled each year," he said.

MAYOR WANTS EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FESTIVAL ORGANIZERS FIGHT PRIVATE PROMOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD GARZA, San Diego County Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of the upcoming Soviet Arts Festival are seeking to block two 
independent promoters from bringing Russian performers -- a rock group and the 
Red Army Choir -- to appear in San Diego at the same time as the festival. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's board meeting of San Diego Festivals Inc., Mayor Maureen O'Connor, 
who is president of the board, discouraged promoter Scott Pederson's plans to 
independently present a series of rock concerts during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We've raised $6 million for a nonprofit festival," the mayor said. "We can't 
present every group that wants to be involved with the festival." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also defended the festival's agreement with the Soviet Ministry of 
Culture, which, according to festival organizers, gives them exclusive rights 
to Soviet presentations in San Diego from Oct. 21 to Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"My point is that it's easy for a profit group to come in after we've spent all 
this money on promoting the festival," she said. "I've got to protect the 
nonprofit, educational aspect of this festival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Good Business Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"Why would we put up this kind of money without some kind of protection? That 
just wouldn't be good business sense." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Pederson's efforts may rest with another local, independent 
producer, Don Hughes, who has a contract to present the Red Army Choir on Nov. 
8-9, also independent of and during the festival. The Red Army Choir is touring 
the country in the fall, and last week Hughes received an encouraging message 
from Gosconcert, an arm of the Ministry of Culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a telex last week from the Gosconcert vice director confirming the 
Red Army Choir would appear," said Hughes' attorney, Robert Besser. Ron 
Johnson, attorney for the city and legal adviser for the festival, "said he 
hadn't received it, so I sent him a copy. My understanding was that the city 
was requesting the Soviets to make a determination, and I took this as a 
response from Russia. As far as I'm concerned, that should end it. There 
shouldn't be any more questions." 
</P>
<P>
After the board meeting, O'Connor said the festival does not consider Hughes' 
position to be any more favorable than Pederson's. 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing applies, as far as I'm concerned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traveled to Russia 
</P>
<P>
Pederson attended Tuesday's board meeting to present his case, saying his 
concerts would benefit a number of local nonprofit organizations. Pederson 
traveled to Russia in April and signed an agreement with Gosconcert to present 
Russian rockers Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik. Before his trip, Pederson met with 
festival artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph. According to Pederson, Joseph said 
nothing to dissuade him and even provided Pederson with contacts in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, Pederson's attempts to contact Joseph were unsuccessful. A 
letter to the festival official also went unanswered. In late July, Pederson 
received a message from Gosconcert, instructing him to cancel the concerts 
because of "contractual obligations with the festival organizing committee." 
</P>
<P>
Pederson told the festival board he simply wants to expand the scope of the 
festival's offerings, which focus on the fine arts.

"I'm not a not-for-profit venture, but there isn't a rock promoter in San Diego 
who is," Pederson told the board. "I stand to lose money because of the delay." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor cut Pederson off, saying the portion of the meeting reserved for 
public comment "isn't for a debate." 
</P>
<P>
"It's most unfortunate your phone calls were not returned, but me and (festival 
Executive Director) Bruce Herring are the official designers of the program." 
She referred Pederson to City Manager and board Vice President John Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
Pederson said that, after the meeting, Lockwood told him "it would take three 
of the four people on that board to vote on something, and he saw it highly 
unlikely that three members would overrule the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give up," Pederson said. "I don't feel I'm the only person in 
San Diego who wants to see Russian rock 'n' roll here."

MARINE CORPS IDENTIFIES PILOT OF MISSING AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a Marine reconnaissance plane missing since Thursday on a flight 
from Camp Pendleton was identified Monday by the Marine Corps as Capt. Sergio 
R. Vivaldi, 29, of Port Chester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Vivaldi and observer 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of Bismarck, N.D., have been 
missing since their OV-10A Bronco aircraft failed to return to the San Diego 
County base at 2:30 p.m. Thursday after a training mission. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 28 aircraft from the Marine helicopter base in Tustin and from Camp 
Pendleton have been searching for the craft in the desert and mountains as far 
east as Phoenix and as far north as Las Vegas. The plane is an olive 
drab-colored, twin-engine turboprop. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers spent another unsuccessful day Monday looking for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gene C. Browne, spokesman for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Orange 
County, said the military is relying on civilian reports to direct the search. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sightings Concentrated 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating search efforts based on valid sightings," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the Marines had received 19 calls from people who recalled seeing 
the plane as it flew overhead, Browne said. The sightings were concentrated in 
the Southern California mountain ranges, including the Big Bear, San Gorgonio 
and San Jacinto areas. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the disappearance of a military plane for this long in Southern 
California is unprecedented for the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually find them after a couple of hours," he said. "It's still a complete 
unknown." 
</P>
<P>
Piehl's sister, Linda Wolski, said Monday that the family is hopeful that the 
craft will be found. She said Piehl is an expert at desert survival who has 
trained infantry troops on what to do if lost in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of hope he'll be found soon," Wolski said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Vivaldi's family were unsuccessful Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Civilians who may have seen the observation plane between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 
p.m. Thursday are asked to call the El Toro Marine base at (714) 726-2512.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECTED CON MAN CAPTURED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Monday arrested a man suspected of being a scam artist who tells his 
victims a heart-wrenching story before swindling them. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Robert Oakley said Bruce Ralph Lepthien is a suspect in 
several scams in Southern California. The person sought would tell his victim 
that he needed a ride to an emergency room, where his wife had supposedly been 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Once the person reached the hospital, he asked the victim for money to buy 
flowers for his wife and a taxi ride home, Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Beach housewife called police Monday afternoon after Lepthien 
allegedly knocked on her door and told her a similar tale, Oakley said. The 
woman, who lives on the 300 block of Evening Canyon Drive, told him that she 
could not help and alerted police. 
</P>
<P>
After the woman informed the police, she saw the suspect soliciting her 
next-door neighbor, who was willing to drive him to the hospital. The housewife 
told the suspect that police officers were coming and to get out of the car, 
Oakley said. Lepthien then fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the suspect walking several blocks away. He was arrested on 
suspicion of burglary, Oakley said, because he allegedly entered a residence 
with an intent to commit a felony. Lepthien is being held at Newport Beach City 
Jail in lieu of a $25,000 bond.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $40-MILLION PROGRAM FOR JOB CREATION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley approved a new $40-million loan program Monday 
designed to aid the growth of small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing businesses provide a significant number of jobs for 
low-to-moderate-income persons," Bradley said at a City Hall news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Common Bond Reserve Fund program is designed to preserve the city's 330,000 
manufacturing jobs and allow those businesses to expand. Marilyn Lurie of the 
Community Development Department said two-thirds of those jobs are in 
economically depressed areas and are concentrated in the furniture, apparel and 
food-processing industries. 
</P>
<P>
The new program, approved unanimously by the City Council last week and signed 
by Bradley on Monday, will enable companies to borrow money at the same 
low-interest rates usually reserved for larger, Fortune 500-type firms, the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized businesses concentrated in Los Angeles' poorest 
communities are being targeted for the loans. The program would require a 
company to create at least one new job for every $50,000 it borrows. 
</P>
<P>
The city is investing $6 million to begin the program. Additional funds will be 
raised through the sale of bonds, backed by a letter of credit from Algemene 
Bank Nederland.

UCI WOMEN'S CENTER GETS $110,000 DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Newport Beach resident has donated $110,000 toward building a 
permanent facility for the Women's Opportunity Center on the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Shannon O'Bryan, who now lives in St. Helena in Napa County, donated the 
money for construction and equipment for a 4,000-square-foot building for the 
nonprofit organization, which has been providing career and personal guidance 
to women on and off campus since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is scheduled to be built next summer next to the University 
Extension building, where the center now has its offices. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bryan, the former president of a Newport Beach interior design firm, has been 
chairwoman of the center's donor campaign since February. She moved to St. 
Helena recently. 
</P>
<P>
The center will name a library in honor of her work with the center, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a campaign goal of $1.6 million for the new building. Private 
donations so far have reached $640,000.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEA LION KILLER GETS MAXIMUM PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who pleaded no contest to killing a sea lion near the Redondo Beach 
harbor last year was given the maximum sentence Monday of one year in prison, a 
$500 fine and one year probation. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph T. Mansfield, 36, of Long Beach was charged with killing the federally 
protected mammal by feeding it an explosive device hidden inside a sardine. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lion, which boaters in the Redondo Beach harbor called "Bobo," bled to 
death and was discovered floating near the harbor in November. Boaters and 
nearby marine residents said Bobo was like a pet to them and would often take a 
fish from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Co-defendant Steven E. Mitchell, 34, of Redondo Beach, who pleaded no contest 
to aiding and abetting in the killing, was sentenced to 60 days in a community 
treatment center, a $500 fine, five years' probation and 1,200 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mansfield and Mitchell are free on bail and are scheduled to begin serving 
their terms in three weeks, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Alice C. Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield's sentence marks the first time the maximum penalty has been handed 
down under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said the maximum sentence was recommended to U.S. District Judge Manuel L. 
Real in Los Angeles because the crime was "extremely serious and malicious."

SANTA ANA MAN SHOT WHILE CHASING THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Monday were seeking information in the wounding of a man who was shot 
while trying to stop two young men from stealing beer at a Santa Ana 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Williams, 27, of Santa Ana suffered a bullet wound in his chest about 2 
a.m. Sunday when he chased two youths out of the AM-PM Mini Market at Main 
Street and MacArthur Boulevard. Police said the two youths had just darted out 
of the store without paying for two 12-packs of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was in satisfactory condition in the intensive care unit at United 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, a nursing supervisor said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The youths escaped in a car with two others after leaving the wounded Williams 
lying next to a gas pump, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
None of about 20 people in the store at the time could describe the car, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A store employee said Monday that Williams was brave to go after the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in line and said, 'I'll get them,' " clerk Tom Singer said. "Next 
thing, he was shot. Here was a customer who helped, and he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 15-YEAR-OLD SENT TO CYA FOR SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old gang member was sentenced Monday to the California Youth 
Authority for killing an 11-year-old girl and critically wounding her aunt 
during a drive-by attack on rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile defendant, whose name was withheld because of his age, can be held 
at the CYA until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced by Los Angeles Juvenile Court Commissioner Jack Gold, who 
convicted him July 26 of one count each of first-degree murder, first-degree 
attempted murder, drive-by shooting, assault with a deadly weapon and 
conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry Bradley said the gang member was one of two gunmen who 
opened fired from their passing car on rival gang members in the Pico-Union 
district last Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Walking near the rivals when the shooting started were Blanca Cabrera and two 
of her nieces, ages 11 and 14. The 11-year-old, Jasmine Guevara, was struck in 
the head by a shotgun blast and killed. 
</P>
<P>
The aunt was also struck by gunfire and was critically wounded. The 14-year-old 
fell to the ground to avoid being struck and escaped injury.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 16, IS CHASED, BEATEN, FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Sylmar boy was killed Monday morning in San Fernando by four 
assailants, apparently in the mistaken belief that he had killed a member of a 
gang they associated with, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The four suspects rammed the motorcycle Jimmie Torrez was riding and, when he 
fell off, beat him and shot him with a rifle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, three men and a 16-year-old boy were arrested on 
suspicion of murder and were being held without bail at the San Fernando Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Torrez "was wrongly identified as a suspect in a gang killing," San Fernando 
Police Sgt. Michael Harvey said. "The guys who chased him down thought he had 
killed a friend of theirs. But he was not a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
The earlier killing occurred several weeks ago in the Pacoima area, Harvey 
said. He said the victim of that slaying was a gang member and the four 
suspects in the Torrez killing were associated with the same gang. Police said 
they had no information that Torrez belonged to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the assailant's car to San Fernando police and the vehicle 
was sighted shortly afterward about a half-mile from the shooting scene, 
Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. The car was halted and the suspects were 
arrested without incident.

JET NEARING LONG BEACH BARELY MISSES LIGHT PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Alaska Airlines jetliner swerved to miss a light plane by only 150 feet as 
the airliner was coming in for a landing Saturday at Long Beach Airport, 
according to the pilot of the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that a collision was avoided 
when controllers at the Coast Terminal Radar Control facility in Orange County 
advised the pilot of the Seattle-to-Long Beach flight that the small plane 
appeared to be dangerously close and the pilot made a 30-degree turn to the 
left. 
</P>
<P>
While the unexpected turn caused the jetliner to bank sharply, passengers had 
already been advised to fasten their seat belts for the imminent landing, and 
there were no reports of injury. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Flight 152, who was not identified, brought the MD-80 jetliner in 
for a routine landing at the Long Beach facility, the FAA said. The pilot then 
reported the incident to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the unidentified light plane -- probably a Cessna 150 -- was not 
equipped with a transmitting device that enables controllers to determine its 
altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Such devices, called Mode C transponders, have been mandatory over the Los 
Angeles Basin since July 1. However, because of manufacturers' delays in 
delivering some of the devices, aircraft owners who have ordered the 
transponders have been given until Oct. 1 to have them installed. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA rule that went into effect July 1 requires all planes operating within 
30 miles of a so-called "primary airport" to be equipped with a Mode C 
transponder unless a waiver has been granted. Los Angeles International Airport 
is classified as a primary airport, and Long Beach Airport is about 15 miles 
south of it. 
</P>
<P>
Because the light plane involved in the incident has not been identified, it is 
not known whether it was operating under a waiver or in violation of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Abels, a spokeswoman for the FAA, said there have been few reports of 
problems resulting from the waivers.

FIRM CO-OWNED BY FIRED SUBCONTRACTOR HIRED FOR METRO RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unlicensed subcontractor who had been kicked off a Metro Rail job and 
accused of payroll cheating is part owner of a firm that was subsequently hired 
in his place to work on downtown subway stations, transit district authorities 
acknowledged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory C. Park is a partner in Citicon Inc., the firm that took over when the 
Park-owned PIE Construction Co. of Van Nuys was removed from the Metro Rail job 
because its contracting license had expired, Southern California Rapid Transit 
District officials said. Park had been accused of falsifying payroll records 
and pocketing up to half his workers' wages. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly (Park) was the same guy we had to remove last spring," said Greg Davy, 
transit district spokesman. Officials of the bonding company that had ensured 
that PIE would complete the $1.6-million project made the decision to hire 
Citicon to finish up when PIE was removed, Davy said. "We have no control over 
rehiring," Davy explained. 
</P>
<P>
District officials contend that they knew nothing of the criminal investigation 
of Park's operations by either the state labor commissioner or the district 
attorney's office until news accounts of his arrest surfaced early last week. 
Park's interest in Citicon did not disqualify the firm from assuming the 
contract in May, just after PIE was removed from the project, they said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles district attorney's office, Park was arrested on 
two felony complaints charging that he falsely reported paying up to $27.79 an 
hour to PIE employees. The workers endorsed PIE payroll checks and gave them 
back to their employers, accepting $12 to $15 an hour in cash, said Sandi 
Gibbons, a district attorney's office spokeswoman. Park is to be arraigned 
Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Park, 48, of San Dimas is a member of the Los Angeles County Citizens Planning 
Council, a body that makes recommendations to the county Regional Planning 
Commission. He was appointed to the post by Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Park has denied that he or PIE cheated the workers. The firm was hired to 
install electrical conduit in two subway station projects. He acknowledged that 
the firm's license had lapsed and acknowledged that he is half-owner of 
Citicon. He said, "We (Citicon) are paying the prevailing wages." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Web 
</P>
<P>
The complex web of events began when PIE -- designated a "disadvantaged 
enterprise" by the transit district and awarded contracts given to minority-run 
firms -- let its contracting license lapse but continued to work for two prime 
contractors, Guy F. Atkinson Co. of South San Francisco and Tudor-Saliba-Perini 
Inc. of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
When the transit district ordered PIE off the two jobs in May, there were 
allegations that the company was not paying prevailing wages and fringe 
benefits, as required on federally funded projects. Both the district 
attorney's office and the state labor commissioner said the investigation of 
Park's companies is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials said they are watching Citicon payrolls closely and all 
indications are that the firm is paying the required prevailing wages.

NEW MANAGERS REOPEN CENTER SHUT BY CHILD-ABUSE CHARGES

<P>
An Ocean Beach preschool, closed after state child-abuse allegations against 
its owners, reopened Monday under new management. 
</P>
<P>
Only half of the 80 children who were enrolled at the Loma Alta preschool and 
nursery before the charges returned there Monday, said W. James Bumiller, the 
school's new operator. "There has been considerable damage done to the school," 
Bumiller said. 
</P>
<P>
Bumiller and his wife, Elvina, took over the school from Lewis and Jeanne 
Sasaran after the state Department of Social Services accused the couple of 
molesting a 3-year-old girl in their care. In an arrangement approved by the 
state, the Sasarans remain owners of the school but are barred from the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The Bumillers, who run three other preschools in San Diego County, obtained a 
new license to operate Loma Alta after parents complained that the school's 
closing left them without daytime child care. If the Sasarans do not appeal the 
revocation of their license or lose an appeal, the Bumillers will take over the 
school permanently, James Bumiller said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to the wishes of the parents, state officials approved Bumiller's 
license in one day, short-cutting what they said was normally a three-month 
process. They also promised the couple that their 90-day temporary license soon 
will be replaced with a permanent one, James Bumiller said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement addressed to the media and posted on the preschool's gate Monday 
morning, the Bumillers asked to be left alone: "The life and times of this 
school are no longer newsworthy. . . . The children now deserve to be in a 
normal, calm environment so they can get back to the business of learning and 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
The Sasarans, meanwhile, could face other problems. San Diego police have 
passed the results of a criminal investigation into the child-abuse charges to 
the district attorney's office. A spokeswoman there said no decision has been 
made on the question of prosecuting the couple.

PRINGLE ACCUSED OF PAYING HIS ATTORNEYS IMPROPERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Democratic opponent of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) Monday 
accused the freshman legislator of improperly paying lawyers nearly $50,000 to 
defend him in a federal lawsuit out of a fund set up for a different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat, Jerry Yudelson, who ran unsuccessfully against Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in 1988 and says he plans to challenge Pringle in 1990, 
asked for an investigation of Pringle's campaign finances in a complaint sent 
Monday to the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's campaign statements "show a cavalier disregard" for new 
campaign-financing rules established under Proposition 73, which was passed by 
voters in last year's primary election, Yudelson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Michioku, an FPPC spokeswoman, said Yudelson's complaint had not reached 
the commission and added: "We'll take a look at the complaint when we receive 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle acknowledged Monday that, on his lawyers' advice, he paid them out of 
funds from a committee established to defend him against a recall attempt. The 
lawyers, however, are defending him in a federal lawsuit aimed at overturning 
his election last November. Pringle defended his action, saying he felt that it 
was "quite justified" because both the lawsuit and the recall attempt stemmed 
from the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a direct and specific corollary between those two things," Pringle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which is pending in federal court, claims that Pringle, his 
campaign manager and the Orange County Republican Party posted uniformed 
security guards at 20 Santa Ana polling places in the 72nd Assembly District. 
The lawsuit contends that the presence of the guards unconstitutionally 
intimidated first-time Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have defended hiring the guards, saying they had heard rumors that 
Democrats might attempt to bus in illegal voters to the precincts in order to 
tip the hotly contested, $1.6-million race between Pringle and Democrat 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. Thierbach lost by only 867 votes out of about 
67,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropped Recall Plan 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Democrats had planned to try to recall Pringle, citing the 
poll-guard incident, but they later dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said Pringle had set up his recall-defense committee under guidance 
from Kathryn Donovan, legal counsel to the FPPC. Donovan advised Pringle in a 
March 14 letter that the committee must be separate from those established for 
his reelection and that "no funds collected by this committee may be used for 
your other election campaign or office-holder expenses," Michioku related. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign statements filed with the FPPC for the period of Jan. 1 
through June 30 of this year, Pringle raised $59,461.13 to defend himself 
against a possible recall. Most of the money came from two $25,000 loans, one 
from investor Joseph Tuttobene of Brea and the other from Security Pacific Bank 
and secured by Dean Thomas of Fullerton, owner of Delst Chemical &amp; Research 
Co. of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle used $49,098.94 from his recall-committee funds to pay the firm of 
Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert of Irvine, according to campaign 
statements. David A. Robinson and Thomas R. Malcolm of that law firm are 
defending Pringle in the federal suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setback for Pringle 
</P>
<P>
Pringle received a setback in his defense of the lawsuit when the FPPC ruled in 
July that money for his defense came under the same restrictions as his other 
campaign funds. Under Proposition 73 limits, individual donors can give $1,000 
and political action committees can give $2,500 in each elective cycle. 
</P>
<P>
A few months earlier, however, Pringle had good news from the FPPC, which ruled 
that he could raise and spend as much as he needed to defend himself against a 
possible recall. For this reason, Democrats backed off from their plan to try 
to recall Pringle, according to county Democratic Chairman Mike Balmages.

MISSING RECONNAISSANCE PLANE CREW IDENTIFIED; SEARCH CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance airplane missing from Camp 
Pendleton since Thursday has been identified as Capt. Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of 
Port Chester, N.Y., Marine officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vivaldi and observer 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of Bismark, N.D., have been 
missing since their OV-10A Bronco aircraft failed to return to the San Diego 
County base at 2:30 p.m. Thursday after a training mission. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 28 aircraft from the Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin and Camp 
Pendleton have been searching for the craft in desert and mountain areas as far 
east as Phoenix and as far north as Las Vegas. The plane is an olive-colored, 
twin-engine turboprop. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers spent another unsuccessful day Monday looking for the crew. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Marine base spokesman Lt. Gene C. Browne said the military is relying 
on civilian reports to direct the search. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating search efforts based on valid sightings," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the Marines had received 19 calls from people who recalled seeing 
the plane as it flew overhead, Browne said. The sightings were concentrated in 
the Southern California mountain ranges, including the Big Bear, San Gorgonio 
and San Jacinto mountain areas. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the disappearance of a military plane for this long a time in 
Southern California is unprecedented for the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually find them after a couple of hours," he said. "It's still a complete 
unknown (as to what happened)." 
</P>
<P>
Piehl's sister, Linda Wolski, said Monday that he is an expert at desert 
survival who has trained infantry troops on what to do if lost in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of hope he'll be found soon," Wolski said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Vivaldi's family were unsuccessful Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Civilians who may have seen the observation plane between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 
p.m. Thursday are asked to call the El Toro Marine base at (714) 726-2512.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Coast Guard plane Monday continued to patrol the South Pacific in search of a 
San Diego family missing at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Sheri Hughes, together with their sons, Alex, 21, and Ryan, 15, were 
sailing their 39-foot sloop Sea Dreamer on the return leg of a summer-long 
cruise, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Hartvigsen from the Honolulu 
headquarters. The four were last seen July 29, when they left the Palmyra 
island chain 800 miles south of Hawaii, Hartvigsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Dreamer failed to arrive in Hawaii on Aug. 16 as expected, and harbor 
checks in Hawaii and along the California coast turned up no trace of the boat, 
Hartvigsen said. Coast Guard planes searched unsuccessfully off the Southern 
California coast one day last week on the chance that the Hugheses had bypassed 
Hawaii, according to Chief Quartermaster Mark Vavra in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, Coast Guard planes based in Hawaii have covered more than 
300,000 square miles of the South Pacific in search of the family. The search 
will be suspended Thursday if the boat has not been found by then, Hartvigsen 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BARONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former official at the Barona Indian reservation pleaded guilty in federal 
court Monday to a felony charge stemming from the embezzling of about $10,000 
of trial funds. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Osuna, 43, the former tribal secretary and administrator for the Baron 
Band of Mission Indians, pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement from an 
Indian tribal organization. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, of Santa Ysabel, could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in 
federal prison and fined up to $250,000 when she is sentenced Nov. 13 by U. S. 
District Judge Howard B. Turrentine. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Inspector General in the Department of the Interior investigated 
the case after tribal officials suspected that money had been embezzled, 
Assistant U. S. Atty. John R. Kraemer said. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna worked at the reservation near Lakeside from July, 1985, to July, 1988. 
The embezzled funds were not directly related to the bingo operation there, 
Kraemer said. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna has agreed to pay $10,000 restitution to the Barona Indians, Kraemer 
said.

GANG SLAYING OF YOUTH TIED TO MISTAKEN IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Sylmar youth was killed Monday morning in San Fernando by four 
assailants, apparently in the mistaken belief that he had killed a member of a 
gang they associated with, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers chased Jimmie Torrez in their car until he fell off the back of a 
motorcycle, then beat him and shot him in the back, authorities said. Torrez 
was found at Second Street and Hubbard Avenue about 12:30 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying, the first this year in San Fernando, was being investigated by 
police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, three men and a teen-ager were arrested on 
suspicion of murder and were being held without bail at the San Fernando Jail. 
Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said the adults were Albert Martinez, 20, of Lake 
View Terrace, and Manuel Madrigal, 22, and Robert Flores, 23, of Pacoima. The 
name of a 16-year-old Pacoima youth was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Torrez apparently was the victim of mistaken identity. "The 
guys who chased him down thought he had killed a friend of theirs," San 
Fernando Police Sgt. Michael Harvey said. "But he was not a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
The earlier killing occurred several weeks ago in the Pacoima area, Harvey 
said. The victim was a gang member and the four suspects in the Torrez killing 
were associated with the same gang, he said. Police said they had no 
information on whether Torrez belonged to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rammed Motorcycle 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Monday's shooting occurred after the four suspects, who were 
in a car, saw Torrez riding with a friend on a motorcycle. They intentionally 
rear-ended the motorcycle, and a short chase began, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist rode over a curb onto a sidewalk, Wahla said, and the jolt 
threw Torrez off the back. The attackers stopped, grabbed Torrez and punched 
and kicked him, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres tried to flee but was knocked down, police said. "One suspect went to 
the car and got a rifle," Wahla said, and "shot the victim several times while 
he was down on the ground." The attackers fled in their car. Torrez was 
pronounced dead at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. His friend was 
not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the car to police and the vehicle was seen in the 600 block 
of Brand Boulevard, about half a mile from the shooting, Wahla said. A 
.22-caliber semiautomatic rifle believed to have been used to kill Torrez was 
recovered after police saw it thrown from the car. The suspects were arrested 
without incident.

BABY-SITTER FACES MURDER TRIAL IN TODDLER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys baby-sitter on Monday was ordered held for trial on a charge of 
murdering an 18-month-old girl who experts said was scalded with water, beaten 
and then shaken to death. 
</P>
<P>
Nova M. Thompson, 34, who has two children of her own and is pregnant, also was 
ordered to stand trial on a charge of felony child abuse in the June 9 death of 
Jasmine Lynn Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a three-day preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court, Judge Michael S. Luros rejected a defense argument that the death could 
have been accidental. 
</P>
<P>
He described as "very, very credible" testimony by Thompson's 4-year-old 
daughter, Carlaina Johnson, that her mother scalded the little girl and threw 
her into a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Although Luros said the testimony of multiple injuries convinced him the death 
was a case of first- degree murder, which requires premeditation, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Leslie Kenyon said, "Realistically, I think it will end up as second- 
degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of first-degree murder, Thompson could be imprisoned for life, 
while the maximum term for second-degree murder is 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has been in jail since the girl's death, is being held in lieu of 
$400,000 bail. She is to be arraigned in Superior Court on Sept. 11.

FEDERAL DAMAGE SURVEY OF EXXON VALDEZ BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday began a thorough survey to 
determine the extent of damage done to the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran 
aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The physical inspection marked the first time that investigators have set foot 
on the ship that ran aground on a reef. The NTSB has been relying on 
photographs taken by divers who surveyed the ship's damaged hull from the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
But inspectors now will have the opportunity to step inside the Valdez and 
physically inspect its damaged hull, its holding tanks and a complex system of 
pipes and valves that load and unload oil. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB will be accompanied by representatives from the state of Alaska, Exxon 
and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil-company consortium that operates the 
trans-Alaskan pipeline. The investigation is being conducted at National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co., where the crippled tanker is in dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to, in a quantitative way, determine the extent of damage," said 
Lou Colucciello, chief of the NTSB's Washington, D.C.-based marine accident 
division. "It's being done with the participation of parties and will take 
several days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lot of Measurements 
</P>
<P>
Crews will "make measurements to determine how deep the penetrations were, how 
extensive the damage was," Colucciello said. The survey team "will do a lot of 
photographing and measurements," Colucciello said. "We'll spend lots of time 
collecting relevant facts on the accident." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, which was built in San Diego by Nassco, is a single-hulled ship. 
When the damage survey is completed, Nassco crews will repair an area 700 feet 
long and 100 feet wide. They also will repair any holding tanks and piping that 
are damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB report might not be completed for about six months, Colucciello said. 
The federal agency will analyze data gathered in the inspection and publish a 
report that will include the probable cause of the accident and any 
recommendations that might reduce the likelihood of a similar accident. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the state Department of Fish and Game late last week 
completed its involvement in the long-running saga of the Valdez by forwarding 
results of a final ocean-water test to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The sample concluded that the Valdez was responsible for an oil slick that 
appeared in the ocean July 10 as the ship awaited permission to enter San Diego 
Bay, Reed Smith of the fish and game department said. A Coast Guard spokesman 
was not available on Monday to comment on whether charges will be filed against 
Exxon.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2,500 REWARD PLEDGED IN VANDALISM CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley business leaders pledged a $2,500 reward Monday for information 
about vandalism two weeks ago that left the home of a black family a shambles 
and defaced by racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money may also be used to help the family repair and refurbish 
their home on Niles Street, according to spokesmen who said they represent 90% 
of the city's business community. 
</P>
<P>
"We mainly want to send a signal out that the community is behind this family," 
said Jack Parfitt, president of the Simi Valley Noontime Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
"And that we want these sorts of acts to stop," said Burt von Bieberstein, 
president of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The residents -- Northridge Junior High School teacher Louis Boss, his wife, 
Ontee, and their four children -- discovered the damage Aug. 14 when they 
returned from an out-of-town trip. Every room was ransacked and littered with 
piles of ruined belongings, while the word "skinheads" and racial epithets were 
spray-painted on walls inside the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the investigation had been 
made a priority but that there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's three Rotary clubs each pledged $500, with at least $1,000 to be 
used for a reward. The local Kiwanis Club, meanwhile, promised to match up to 
$1,000 for a reward and also offered to pay the deductible on the family's 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaycees offered their labor to repair the house.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. TO CLAIM LAND FOR PACOIMA SENIOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners on Monday approved the beginning 
of eminent domain proceedings to acquire land for the future Pacoima Senior 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The two-acre parcel, northwest of Glenoaks and Van Nuys boulevards, has been 
valued at $675,000. It is near major bus routes and freeways. But the owners 
have not responded to many contacts by city parks staff, causing the city to 
initiate measures to claim the land through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
The center will not be built for several years, but money for land acquisition 
was included in the 1988-89 budget.

VOILA, VIOLA IS METS' WINNER BY A SHUTOUT; 
</P>
<P>
DODGER OFFENSE, LIMITED TO THREE HITS, ABANDONS HERSHISER AGAIN, 1-0 
</P>

<P>
With Cy Young winner facing Cy Young winner, it was the score you would expect. 
</P>
<P>
With the New York Mets' offense backing Frank Viola, guess who had the one run. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodger offense backing Orel Hershiser, guess who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
On two third-inning singles, the Mets defeated the Dodgers, 1-0, Monday in the 
first meeting between defending Cy Young winners in a regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
There were no extra-base hits. There was only one walk. The game took only 2 
hours 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas the Mets scored on third-inning singles by Gregg Jefferies and 
Howard Johnson, the Dodgers' biggest excitement was generated by Tom Lasorda's 
temper tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
And while the Mets broke a five-game losing streak and kept pace with the 
National League East-leading Chicago Cubs, who they trail by 3 1/2 games, the 
Dodgers were shut out for the 14th time this season. That ties Philadelphia for 
the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hershiser, who gave up eight singles: "I've allowed six runs in my last 30 
innings (1.80 earned-run average) and I'm 0-2 during that time. That's all I 
can say." 
</P>
<P>
Said Viola, who gave up three singles in his best performance since coming to 
New York from Minnesota on July 31: "Every time you pitch against a pitcher 
like Hershiser, it's an added incentive to do a good job. It was a lot of fun 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
The most fun for the 38,820 fans at Dodger Stadium came in the seventh inning, 
on a one-out grounder by Mike Marshall that was bobbled by Jefferies, the 
second baseman. Marshall hustled down the first-base line, only to be called 
out by first-base umpire Gerry Davis on a close play. The replays showed that 
Jefferies throw beat Marshall. But neither Marshall, who jumped in Davis' face 
and waved his arms, or a charging Lasorda saw the replay. 
</P>
<P>
After Marshall was pulled aside, Lasorda stood cheek-to-cheek with Davis behind 
first base, screaming and gesturing before finally stalking away. But he was 
not done yet. 
</P>
<P>
First, he threw his gum in Davis' direction. Then, as he crossed the pitchers 
mound, he grabbed and flung the resin bag. At this point, Davis ejected him 
from the game, which only resulted in Lasorda running back to Davis and yelling 
some more. When he finally settled down enough to leave the field, Lasorda 
added one last zinger by throwing his cap. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lasorda's third ejection, his first since June 17, and the maddest 
anyone has seen him in a couple of seasons. 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, Lasorda admitted later that Davis made a good call. 
</P>
<P>
"He made the right call, I saw that later," Lasorda said. "What confused me was 
those guys (Marshall, first base coach Manny Mota) arguing with him over at 
first base. I figured they had a better view of it than I did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong, I admit it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Viola: "Tommy is a show in himself. I figured when the argument was over 
and he kicked the resin bag, he was just trying to mess up my concentration. I 
knew what he was doing. It just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
No indeed, as Viola retired the final eight batters after the tantrum. Facing a 
team with only a couple of players who had seen him before, he fooled the 
Dodgers into many first-pitch outs and easy grounders and popups. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't give us anything," Marshall said. "He's the kind of guy you would 
like to see a few times." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Anderson: "He didn't give us any chances." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser entered with the league's best ERA (2.36), tied for the league lead 
in complete games (eight) and tied for third with 14 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Viola was mostly confused. He was 1-3 with a 3.34 ERA in five starts for the 
Mets. During his starts the Mets had scored seven runs, an average of 1.4 per 
start. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers weren't close to scoring. They blew their first opportunity in 
the third after Mike Scioscia led off with a single to left. Hershiser bunted 
him to second. But then the next two batters couldn't get the ball out of the 
infield, with Jose Gonzalez popping to second and Willie Randolph grounding to 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later they blew their best opportunity, after Jeff Hamilton led off 
with a bouncer to center field that Juan Samuel overran. The ball rolled nearly 
to the fence, and Hamilton ended up on second base on a single and an error. 
</P>
<P>
On an ensuing hit and run by Anderson, his grounder was grabbed by first 
baseman Keith Hernandez. He threw to third baseman Howard Johnson, who tagged a 
sliding Hamilton. Anderson was stranded on first by fly outs from Scioscia and 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser and Frank Viola had almost identical pitch counts. Hershiser 
threw 94 pitches -- 67 strikes and 27 balls. Viola threw 89 pitches -- 64 
strikes and 25 balls. . . ..Viola, who recorded his first National League 
complete game and shutout, also had his first professional hit, a leadoff 
single in the eight inning. But it only led to a baserunning blunder. After he 
moved to second on Gregg Jefferies' infield single, he was caught straying off 
second base and was picked off by catcher Mike Scioscia. . . . Jefferies, 
recovering from a slow early season, has hit in 11 consecutive games . . . This 
was the Dodgers fifth 1-0 loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson will undergo exploratory knee surgery today at 7:30 a.m. at 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center. While packing up equipment at the Dodger 
clubhouse Monday, Gibson said, "I just hope their findings are clear-cut, so 
next spring you'll see a difference." . . . Infielder Mike Sharperson is being 
groomed to be the Dodgers' third catcher. He worked on squatting and catching 
during the recent trip, and spent early Monday afternoon blocking balls in the 
bullpen. "Fred Claire, Dodger vice president) decided we needed a third catcher 
who was a catcher," coach Joe Ferguson said. "In the past, it's always been a 
guy who you didn't really feel comfortable with, who was just filling in. We 
want somebody we can feel good about using there." Sharperson, who has not 
caught since Little League, said his biggest problem is sore legs. "All the 
crouching and getting up and crouching again, after my first couple of days I 
could barely walk," he said. The Dodgers' third catcher is Mickey Hatcher.

<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in the stands at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, a little girl watched 
Jack Clark step up to the plate with two on and two out in the third inning 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mandi Rutherford, 6, a crippled Easter Seals poster child from San Diego, had 
thrown out the ceremonial first pitch before the Padres' game against the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, it would become apparent that this wasn't your normal night. As Mandi 
was being taken up the ramp leading to the field, she was stopped by Clark. He 
hugged her and then made a promise. He promised her a home run. 
</P>
<P>
So in the third inning, with Mandi and 11,274 others looking on, he kept that 
promise. He picked out Kevin Gross' third pitch and deposited it into the 
left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres won their fifth game in a row, 9-4, and that wasn't all from Clark. 
He hit another three-run homer -- this one even deeper to left-center -- in the 
fifth, and in the eighth Mike Pagliarulo hit the Padres' third three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
It was Clark's first homer, though, that sent Roy Rutherford, Mandi's father, 
scrambling to find Padre President Dick Freeman. He delivered a note to Freeman 
explaining what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Said Clark: "She was so cute I couldn't help but sit down and want to give her 
a big hug. We just happened to cross paths." 
</P>
<P>
So Clark stopped for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"She just said, 'Hit me a home run,' " Clark said. "I was like, 'Yeah. Right. 
Sure.' The way I've been hitting lately, and with a guy like Gross, who I've 
never hit one off of. 
</P>
<P>
"It was enough of a distraction. It made me concentrate better." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's best shot of the night didn't even count. It was a long foul that was 
hit halfway up the second level down the left-field line. It came just before 
his second home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Jack, 'You can add all my hits together the last 10 years and they 
don't add up to the three that (you) hit out,' " Tim Flannery said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark finished with six runs batted in, a feat he has accomplished just three 
times in his 13-year major league career. He now has 20 homers. 
</P>
<P>
Career days are the norm for the Padres these days. Against the New York Mets 
Sunday, second baseman Roberto Alomar had a career-high five RBIs. Saturday, 
Marvell Wynne had four RBIs, which tied for the most in his career. 
</P>
<P>
And on a smaller scope, Padre starter Andy Benes struck out eight Monday, which 
was also a career high. Of course, Benes (2-2) made just the fourth start of 
his career, but the Padres are happy with his development. He went 6 2/3 
innings Monday, giving up four runs and five hits. For the first time, Benes 
didn't allow a home run -- the only extra-base hit he allowed was Hubie Brooks' 
fourth-inning double. A positive was his eight strikeouts. A negative was his 
five walks. 
</P>
<P>
"He had pretty good stuff," McKeon said. "He started aiming a bit, but when he 
needed the outs, he got them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Benes: "I felt like I had a better fastball than I've had tonight. The 
only thing I was disappointed in was that I walked five guys, and three 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
As for the winning streak, the Padres have outscored their opposition, 43-21, 
in the last five games. In the last three games, the Padres have flexed their 
offense for 31 runs. 
</P>
<P>
They have now hit homers in 10 consecutive games, which ties the club record 
set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. Tony Gwynn went two for four, which improved his league 
leading average to .347. Mark Davis pitched the final 2 1/3 innings and picked 
up his 32nd save, which puts him in the National League lead. 
</P>
<P>
And, San Francisco lost again, allowing the third-place Padres to move to 
within seven games of the Giants, the closest the Padres have been to first 
place since June 17. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal pitchers arrived in San Diego with a 2.09 earned-run average in their 
last 56 innings, but the Padres weren't impressed. They scored three quick runs 
during a two-out third-inning rally when Clark hit his 19th home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton started it with a singled to left. Gwynn moved him to second 
with a single to center, which ran Gwynn's hitting streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Clark, who was immediately brushed back by Gross. Clark watched one 
more ball go by, and then put Gross' third pitch into the left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's second three-run homer came in the fifth, also after Templeton and 
Gwynn had singled. 
</P>
<P>
It was his third three-run homer against the Expos in two games. He also hit 
one in Montreal Aug. 20 during the Padres' 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos scored their first run in the top of the fourth. Benes walked leadoff 
batter Dave Martinez, got Tom Foley to ground to second but gave up a long 
double to Hubie Brooks, scoring Martinez from second. 
</P>
<P>
Benes got out of another jam in the fifth, but the Expos pulled to within 3-2. 
With one out, Benes walked Mike Fitzgerald and Spike Owen. After Gross struck 
out, Dave Martinez lined a ball off Benes' leg. By the time Benes recovered, 
Martinez was standing on first and the bases were loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Benes was examined by Padre trainers, threw a few warmup pitches and then 
walked Foley to force in a run. Hubie Brooks popped to Templeton to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos got one more in the sixth when Fitzgerald flied to left deep enough 
to allow Wallach to score from third. That left Andres Galarraga on first with 
two out and the Padres ahead, 6-3. Owen hit a sharp grounder into the hole 
between first and second, but Bip Roberts made a diving stop and threw out 
Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal picked up its final run in the seventh. Pinch-hitter Otis Nixon led 
off with a walk, stole second and went to third on Santiago's throwing error. 
He scored on Brooks' single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Roberto Alomar missed Monday night's game because of the flu. . 
. . Bip Roberts replaced Alomar in the lineup, making only his third start at 
second base this season.. . . Here's the rundown on Roberts, the Padres' most 
versatile player: In addition to his three starts at second, he has made 12 
starts at shortstop, 15 at third base, 12 in left field, one in center field 
and 11 in right field. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres won't know whether Bruce Hurst will make his scheduled start 
Saturday until later in the week. Hurst, suffering a groin injury, is scheduled 
to throw on the side Thursday. "We'll find out then how he is," pitching coach 
Pat Dobson said. . . . Outfielder Chris James didn't start Monday but said his 
bruised hand is feeling better. James was injured Saturday when pitcher Don 
Schulze slammed a car door on it. He is listed as day to day. 
</P>
<P>
What do some seventh-year major leaguers look forward to? Finishing eight 
seasons in the majors, so they can get their Gold Card. The Gold Card is good 
for lifetime admission to any major league park for games other than playoff 
and World Series contests. "You can get in, but that doesn't guarantee you a 
seat," Tony Gwynn said. Gwynn said he was looking forward to July 19, when he 
is eligible for his Gold Card. He was recalled from Hawaii, the Padres' former 
triple-A club, on July 19, 1982. . . . Mark Grant's save Sunday against the 
Mets, his first as a Padre, was the club's 36th this season and the first that 
did not involve Mark Davis (31 saves) or Greg Harris (four).

MORNING BRIEFING: PRO FOOTBALL PROGNOSTICATION LOSES ALL OF ITS CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least seven publications have picked the Houston Oilers to win the AFC 
Central this year, and the Philadelphia Inquirer asked Coach Jerry Glanville 
for his reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know if they pick you last, you tell people not to pay any attention 
to them or read them, so I guess if they pick you first, you have to treat it 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you how bad those magazines are. One picked me as coach of the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Add picks: In college football, most of the publications are going with Notre 
Dame as No. 1, but Newsday is picking UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Move over, Independents," Newsday says. "It's time for a change at the top. 
For three straight years, an independent has worn the championship crown. Now, 
all that glitters will be gold and blue as the Bruins' eighth consecutive bowl 
win will be their best yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Terry Donahue will replace quarterback Troy Aikman with Jimmy Bonds or 
Bret Johnson, but look for tailbacks Kevin Williams, Brian Brown and Shawn 
Wills to run wild behind a strong offensive line led by center Frank Cornish." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Former catcher Jeff Torborg, manager of the Chicago White Sox, 
caught no-hitters by what three pitchers? 
</P>
<P>
Can't miss him: At the PGA Seniors tournament in Seattle, Doug Sanders told 
John Peoples of the Seattle Times that there are two questions that fans always 
ask when the seniors play. "No. 1 is, 'What did Arnold Palmer shoot?' No. 2 is, 
'What is Doug Sanders wearing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Peoples: "Yesterday, Sanders sported a neon-orange and brown outfit. It 
was mild compared to the baby blue and Circus Circus pink getup he wore in 
Tuesday's pro-am." 
</P>
<P>
Dome king: From Richard Justice of the Washington Post: "Bo Jackson in the 
Kingdome: Eight home runs and 18 RBIs in 18 games for the Royals and 252 yards 
and three touchdowns in two games with the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
He's thinking: Detroit rookie Rodney Peete, who quarterbacked USC teams that 
lost to Michigan State and Michigan in the Rose Bowl, told Detroit writer Mitch 
Albom: "Yeah, I knew I was gonna end up in Detroit, so I figured I'd just make 
friends with the people early." 
</P>
<P>
Piece of cake: Said San Francisco slugger Kevin Mitchell when asked if he was 
feeling the pressure of the media: "No, I don't feel pressure. Pressure is when 
you're in an alley with nothing in your hands and you're confronted by six 
tough guys. What do you do? Hit the biggest, and run for your life." 
</P>
<P>
Short shot: From Bob McGarry of the Providence Journal-Bulletin: "After 
watching a commercial of Cincinnati Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason running 
around in his Hanes underwear, here's hoping he sticks to playing football for 
a living and his career in the advertising world is, shall we say, brief." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Sandy Koufax, Bill Singer, Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Philadelphia Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, on his relationship with owner 
Norman Braman: "We're good friends now. I think he knows I'm doing a hell of a 
job. I've told him enough times."

Running back Greg Bell signed a two-year contract with the Rams Monday, a deal 
that his agent said left Bell "satisfied," although the running back appeared 
anything but happy. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, the Rams' leading rusher last season, will receive a base salary of about 
$500,000 a year plus incentives. Reserve tackle Robert Cox also signed Monday 
and will get about $185,000 this season and $200,000 the next. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who rushed for 1,212 yards last season, drove into camp late Monday 
afternoon, signed, walked over to the Ram locker room, talked with teammates 
then walked to his car, trailed by reporters. After a terse exchange, he left. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a happy running back? 
</P>
<P>
"Greg made the decision to dedicate himself to football and leave all the other 
things aside," said Steve Feldman, Bell's agent. "I think he just wants to put 
on his uniform, show up, play and go home and not get involved in any 
controversies." 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are a tough bunch. The negotiations were extremely difficult, I can't 
tell you we got everything we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we got enough of it or we wouldn't have come in. If he (Bell) wasn't 
satisfied he wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is, Ram Coach John Robinson expects him to be ready to play in 
Saturday's exhibition finale against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if one preseason game and a couple weeks of practice are enough to be 
ready for the season opener against Atlanta, Robinson said: "I don't think he 
can carry 30 times, but I think he can have a major contribution in the Atlanta 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that Bell returns to the team as the starter, but made no 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
"Like anything else, we're going to play the best guy," he said. "If Greg comes 
back and he's the third-best guy then he won't play. I'm not real interested in 
pecking orders, when Greg is Greg Bell he's the best tailback we've got right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, the Rams' third-best tackle, reportedly agreed to a two-year deal over the 
weekend, but did not sign until an hour after Bell.

CHARGERS APPEAR TO PASS TEST ON STEROIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HENNING DOESN'T EXPECT ANY PROBLEMS WHEN RESULTS COME OUT TODAY

Monday was the day the Chargers found out from the National Football League 
whether any of their players had tested positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have any problems there," Charger Coach Dan Henning said 
after the morning practice. That was confirmed by the end of the day when the 
Chargers heard from the league. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks favorable," Henning said after the afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Very favorable," said Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Club personnel for all teams were asked by the league not to confirm or deny 
whether they had any positive tests on their teams. Then the league put the 
teams in a tough position when it said the total number of players testing 
positive was about 20. That, according to one league official, was "much lower 
than anybody expected." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL said it would release the names of players who tested positive this 
morning. But it didn't want the teams that were clean of steroids to say so 
until that release. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the league was going to release the names of the positive testers 
Monday. But it delayed the announcement a day after the NFL Players Assn. tried 
unsuccessfully to obtain a temporary restraining order barring the league from 
releasing the names. 
</P>
<P>
Players who tested positive will be suspended for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said quarterback Jim McMahon probably will play half of the team's 
final exhibition game Friday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium against the 
Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Which half," Henning said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Burt Grossman, the Chargers' first-round draft pick, reported Friday and is 
trying to catch up with the rest of his teammates after missing more than a 
month of practices. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks quick and rangy," Henning said. "But he sometimes gets frustrated 
because he doesn't know what he's doing yet. He'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, a defensive end, will play against Phoenix. "I hope he plays a good 
deal," Henning said. "Whatever he's capable of taking, I think he'll play." 
</P>
<P>
No. 40 was at practice for the Chargers Monday morning. But it wasn't unsigned 
free agent Gary Anderson, the team's leading rusher last year. It was Beau 
Ortmayer, wearing Anderson's jersey with the name "Ortmayer" where the Chargers 
wished "Anderson" would be. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Ortmayer is the 9-year-old son of Steve Ortmayer. The younger Ortmayer 
took his role seriously, even though no one else did. He had his ankles taped 
before practice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Running back Lionel James, cut by the Chargers Saturday, was claimed by the 
Kansas City Chiefs. Look for kicker Vince Abbott, also cut by the Chargers 
Friday, to get a long look from the Phoenix Cardinals. . . . The Chargers, who 
are down to 69 players on their roster, must reduce that number to 60 today by 
1 p.m. The latest cuts were linebacker Jeff Jackson and offensive lineman Eric 
Floyd. The Chargers might place linebacker Keith Browner on the retired list. 
Until then, he still counts on the team's active roster. . . . After hearing 
teammates call veteran linebacker Jim Collins "old man," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning asked linebacker Billy Ray Smith what that made him (Henning). Smith's 
reply: "The older man." Collins is 31. Henning is 47. . . . Defensive lineman 
Bob Buczkowski missed practice with a sore back. He hurt the back Saturday and 
didn't practice Sunday. . . . Nose tackle Mike Charles has returned to practice 
after minor arthroscopic surgery followed by several sessions in the Chargers' 
conditioning room. "Did you see Mike Charles?" Henning said. "He looks like a 
tight end. I ought to send 'em all in the conditioning room for a week. Imagine 
that, a guy looking trimmed up at 298 (pounds)."

BELL STILL UNHAPPY AFTER DEAL WITH RAMS ; 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK SIGNS 2-YEAR CONTRACT; OFFENSIVE LINEMAN COX ALSO SIGNS

Greg Bell signed a two-year contract with the Rams Monday, a deal his agent 
said left Bell "satisfied," though the running back appeared anything but 
gleeful. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, the Rams' leading rusher last season, signed to receive a base salary of 
about $500,000 a year plus incentives. Reserve tackle Robert Cox also signed 
Monday and will get about $185,000 this year and $200,000 the next. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who rushed for 1,212 yards last season, drove into camp late Monday 
afternoon, signed, walked over to the Ram locker room, talked with teammates, 
then walked to his car, trailed by reporters. After a terse exchange, he left. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg made the decision to dedicate himself to football and leave all the other 
things aside," said Steve Feldman, who represents Bell and Cox. "I think he 
just wants to put on his uniform, show up, play and go home and not get 
involved in any controversies, either pro or con as it relates to the Los 
Angeles Rams." 
</P>
<P>
Which seems to roughly translate to yet another brutal negotiating session for 
a Ram player with the front office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are a tough bunch. The negotiations were extremely difficult, I can't 
tell you we got everything we wanted," Feldman said. "Obviously we got enough 
of it or we wouldn't have come in. If he (Bell) wasn't satisfied, he wouldn't 
be here." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is, Ram Coach John Robinson expects him to be ready to play in 
Saturday's exhibition finale against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if one exhibition game and a couple weeks of practice can prepare Bell 
for the season opener against Atlanta, Robinson said: "I don't think he can 
carry 30 times, but I think he can have a major contribution in the Atlanta 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that Bell returns to the team as the starter, but made no 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
"Like anything else, we're going to play the best guy," he said. "If Greg comes 
back and he's the third best guy, then he won't play. I'm not real interested 
in pecking orders, when Greg is Greg Bell, he's the best tailback we've got 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, the Rams' third-best tackle, had reportedly agreed to terms on a two-year 
deal over the weekend, then apparently un-agreed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cox did not show for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed what I read in the paper," Robinson said before practice. 
"So I thought that Cox was going to be here. I don't know what the problem is. 
Buyer's remorse or something." 
</P>
<P>
When Cox did sign, about an hour after Bell, he too seemed less than thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the end, it's done, no comment, it's a done deal, can't give you any 
specifics but we worked out the details, see you Wednesday morning," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said that the Cox and the Rams had never really reached an agreement 
over the weekend because of "some snags." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will pare down their roster to 60 players today, but don't expect 
anything earth-shattering. "I don't think there's anyone who's getting cut who 
could really make the team," Coach John Robinson said. NFL teams have to get 
down to their final complement of 47 players by Sept. 4. . . . Robinson allowed 
tight end Pat Carter to miss Monday's practice so he could retrieve his clothes 
from Detroit. Carter was acquired two weeks ago in a trade with the Detroit 
Lions. . . . Third-year linebacker Wayne Davis was released to allow him time 
to hook up with another team. "We wanted to give Wayne an extra day to find a 
job," Robinson said. "We gave guys who were close to making the team who might 
have the chance to make a team somewhere else, the option of being cut early."

STEWART GETS HIS 18TH VICTORY AS ATHLETICS EASILY HANDLE YANKEES, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nolan Ryan and Dwight Gooden get more accolades. Orel Hershiser and Roger 
Clemens get more money. But no pitcher in baseball gets more victories than 
Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart became the first 18-game winner in the major leagues and Dave Parker 
and Walt Weiss each hit home runs as the Oakland Athletics beat the New York 
Yankees, 7-3, at New York Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"As always, I did just enough to win," Stewart said. "When it comes time to 
take control, I do that." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (18-8) moved closer to his third consecutive 20-victory season, a feat 
last accomplished by Jim Palmer, who had four in a row, from 1975-78. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Yankees, Stewart didn't need that much. Oakland tagged Andy Hawkins 
(13-13) in taking a 5-1 lead in the third inning and made New York 2-10 under 
Manager Bucky Dent. Dennis Eckersley earned his 28th save. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Detroit 3 -- Nick Esasky hit his 26th homer, a three-run shot in the 
first inning, and took over the league RBI lead with 93 as the Red Sox beat the 
Tigers at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have lost nine in a row, with the Red Sox completing a five-game 
sweep. Boston extended its longest winning streak of the year to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (12-9) shut out the Tigers on three singles for five innings 
before tiring and getting relief help in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up three hits and one run in the sixth, Boddicker gave up two 
singles to start the seventh and was replaced by Rob Murphy, who pitched 2 1/3 
innings and allowed a run. Lee Smith got the last two outs for his 19th save. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, Toronto 2 -- At Toronto, Robin Yount had three hits, including his 
15th homer, and newcomer Ed Romero drove in two runs as the Brewers snapped a 
six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Filer (5-2) gave up two runs and four hits over five innings, as the 
Brewers stopped the Blue Jays' six-game winning streak. Bill Krueger earned his 
third save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's George Bell extended his hitting streak to a career-high 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Seattle 4 -- The Mariners tied a club record when their losing 
streak reached 12 in this game at Minnesota. Kirby Puckett doubled home Dan 
Gladden with two out in the 10th inning to give the Twins their sixth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the 10th, Wally Backman singled and was forced at second on 
Gladden's grounder to third before Puckett doubled against reliever Mike 
Schooler (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon (5-3), who blew a save opportunity in the ninth, retired Seattle 
in order in the 10th inning for the victory.

<P>
WILANDER HOPES TO SALVAGE A MISERABLE 1989 SEASON WITH A MEMORABLE U.S. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a gray, breezy Monday afternoon, Mats Wilander returned to the scene of his 
greatest triumph, the U.S. Open, which oddly enough doesn't seem particularly 
glad to have him back. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year, the sun may not have shone on Wilander this time in his 
first-round match against Horst Skoff, but it didn't matter. Wilander defeated 
the Austrian clay-court specialist, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1, in 1 hour 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander is rated no better than an 8-1 choice to win the Open, but after what 
has happened to him since the last time he played here, when he was King for a 
day in Queens, those aren't bad odds. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wouldn't really have preferred a tougher match. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd rather win," Wilander said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander is fifth-seeded, the worst seeding for a defending champion in 13 
years, since Manuel Orantes was sixth-seeded. And even though this is where 
Wilander beat Ivan Lendl in a five-set final to claim the No. 1 ranking, this 
is also where Wilander began sliding. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Wilander has won only one tournament, a minor Nabisco Grand 
Prix event in Palermo, Italy, last October. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander is 0-for-1989, as far as winning tournaments. He made it to only one 
final and lost to Andres Gomez at Boston. Losing matches cost Wilander the No. 
1 ranking, which he held about four months. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much difference between the Wilander of this Open and the last, he 
said, except for one critical area: "Mentally, I don't have the same kind of 
confidence because I haven't won tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Against Skoff, Wilander seemed to establish himself as a challenger to those 
favored to take his title -- Ivan Lendl, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, John 
McEnroe. Wilander won 81% of the points on his first serve and won 19 points on 
21 approaches to the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a little confidence when I play on that court and I think that is from 
playing well last year." 
</P>
<P>
His performances elsewhere this year are a different story. Wilander's match 
record is 27-15 and he has gotten no further than the quarterfinals in the 
three previous Grand Slam events. Last year, Wilander won three Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I really struggled, I really didn't feel like playing," Wilander 
said. "I just wanted to enjoy the fact that I became No. 1. Then I lost a few 
matches, maybe one too many, and my confidence was down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was No. 1 for such a short time that I really didn't feel any pressure. In a 
way, I've proved my point. Right now, I would love to be No. 1, but I think I 
enjoyed my three or four months more than some players enjoy it even though 
they are No. 1 their whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander said playing well in the Open is the one way he can salvage an 
otherwise disappointing year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, if you win it, then 1989 was not such a bad year after all," he 
said. "On the other hand, you can get to the final and play a great match and 
lose a tough match and that would make it a pretty good year as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not obsessed at all."

IT'S FEAST, FAMINE AS GILBERT IS UPSET

The No. Ate Seed? 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert, who said he had an upset stomach after overeating the night 
before, was upset Monday in the first round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth-seeded and eighth-ranked Gilbert lost to Todd Witsken, 4-6, 7-6 
(7-4), 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, which ended Gilbert's streak of three straight tournament 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he just felt sick about that. "I got sick this morning," Gilbert 
said. "Maybe I ate too much last night, but I didn't have anything left the 
last two sets. My brain wanted to, but my body just wasn't listening." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert ate bananas, chocolate and brownies and drank water and soda during the 
match to try to get some energy, but wound up with muscle cramps instead. 
</P>
<P>
"That's God's way of torturing you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witsken, 24, and ranked No. 63, is used to upsets at the Open. In 1986, Witsken 
upset Jimmy Connors in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Witsken won the last four games of the final set, capitalizing on Gilbert's 
unforced errors. Gilbert, who had won 17 consecutive matches, mis-hit 
forehands, backhands and volleys. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Gilbert double-faulted 10 times, Witsken twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think winning all those matches and playing so much tennis is tiring," 
Witsken said. "I think he might be needing a rest." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, 28, used a service winner and two aces to win the first set, 
overcoming unforced errors on both baseline shots and volleys. 
</P>
<P>
But Witsken, 25, of Carmel, Ind., hit passing shots left and right as Gilbert 
charged the net. He forced a tiebreaker in the second set, subsequently 
winning, 7-4, as he won the last five points. 
</P>
<P>
Witsken, who has been on the men's tour since 1982 but has never won a singles 
tournament, is better known as a doubles player. Witsken reached the 
quarterfinals at the Australian Open last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was more fit than Brad was," Witsken said. "I play long matches 
almost every time. Brad serves and volleys more, and has quicker points." 
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee is expected to take action this week on a 
rule that would ban anyone from future Olympics who has played in South Africa 
since the Seoul Olympics. That would affect Brad Gilbert, who played in a Grand 
Prix tournament in Johannesburg last year. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said such a ruling would be "incredibly unjust." He said tournaments 
are held in the Soviet Union and Japan, and each of those countries violate 
civil rights. "I'm not going to say I agree with apartheid," Gilbert said. 
"It's a terrible thing. But you can't single one country out. In China, they 
kill people on the streets. That's not too lovely. And we're going to play a 
tournament there." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, who said he would not play an exhibition in South Africa, said he 
wouldn't be bothered by an Olympics ban. "In 1992, I'll be 32 and I'll be there 
anyway," he said. "I'll be there spectating." 
</P>
<P>
Buy a ticket to Court 3 today and see all the Sanchez kids: Javier (vs. Paul 
Chamberlin), Emilio (vs. Donnie Leacraft), and Arantxa (vs. Jo-Anne Faull). 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf said she is too used to practicing against men, which is why she 
started slowly in her 6-3, 6-1 victory over Etsuko Inoue of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was rushing too much," Graf said. "I had no patience. I miss a lot 
of forehands in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Graf's forehand, her best shot, was erratic throughout. She had 14 forehand 
winners and 15 forehand unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
In other results Monday, Boris Becker swept David Pate, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1; John 
McEnroe beat Eric Winogradsky of France, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4; Albert Mancini of 
Argentina struggled past Jonathan Canter, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, and Aaron 
Krickstein, 14th-seeded, beat Richard Matuszewski, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Fifth-seeded 
Zina Garrison defeated Radka Zrubakova of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 6-1, No. 14 
Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union ousted Pascale Paradis of France, 1-6, 6-4, 
7-6, and No. 15 Conchita Martinez of Spain beat Sandra Birch, 6-3, 6-2.

GUERRERO DOESN'T RETURN FAVOR, LIFTS CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds did Pedro Guerrero a favor and wound up paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have walked me," said Guerrero, whose two-run eighth-inning single 
gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 3-2 victory over the Reds Monday night at St. 
Louis. "I don't know what was on their mind. I know that he gave me a good 
pitch to hit, and I hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero drove in his 89th and 90 runs of the season with two out against 
hard-throwing Cincinnati reliever Rob Dibble as the Cardinals won for the 11th 
time in their last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have been able to get him out," Dibble said. "I made a good pitch. It 
just wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pendleton, a switch-hitter batting .351 for his career with the bases 
loaded, was on deck when Guerrero connected to score runners from second and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's hit spoiled a strong effort by Red rookie Scott Scudder, who shut 
out St. Louis on four hits through seven innings before being relieved by 
Dibble (7-4). St. Louis starter John Costello (3-2) was relieved by Todd 
Worrell, who pitched the final inning for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, Pittsburgh 2 -- Pete Smith beat the Pirates for the first time in 
six decisions, and Jeff Blauser hit his third home run in three games as the 
Braves defeated the Pirates at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (4-13) came into the game 0-5 with an earned-run average of 9.32 in five 
appearances against the Pirates. He pitched 6 2/3 innings, gave up five hits, 
struck out four and walked three. Mike Stanton, the third Atlanta pitcher, 
worked the last two innings for his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Houston 1 -- Greg Maddux pitched a six-hitter and Shawon Dunston hit 
a two-run double in a four-run first inning to lead the Cubs past the Astros at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, which made three errors, lost for the sixth time in seven games. 
Chicago won for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux (15-10) won for the ninth time in 12 decisions, striking out four and 
walking two in his sixth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9, San Francisco 1 -- Charlie Hayes hit a home run and drove in 
four runs as the Phillies handed Rick Reuschel his worst defeat in two seasons 
at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel (15-6) gave up seven runs and seven hits in 2 1/3 innings, his worst 
outing since Oct. 1, 1987. He lost for the first time in three starts since 
returning from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Howell (11-9) won his second consecutive game and has given up only two 
earned runs and six hits in his last 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, Montreal 4 -- At San Diego, Jack Clark hit two three-run home runs 
and Andy Benes won his second consecutive start as the Padres extended their 
winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Clark tied a career high with six RBIs, the third time he has done it. Both 
homers came off Kevin Gross (10-9), and marked the first time this season that 
a Padre has hit two homers in a game. Clark has 20 homers for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Benes (2-2) pitched 6 2/3 innings in his fourth major league start and was 
relieved by Mark Davis, who pitched the final 2 1/3 innings for his 32nd save.

NEWSWIRE: 76ERS SEND CHEEKS TO SPURS IN 5-MAN DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers traded guards Maurice Cheeks and David Wingate and 
center Christian Welp to the San Antonio Spurs Monday for guard Johnny Dawkins 
and forward Jay Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks is the all-time National Basketball Assn. leader in steals with 1,942 
and is 11th in assists with 6,212. A four-time All-Star, Cheeks averaged 12.2 
points in 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round draft pick by the 76ers in 1987, Welp averaged 3.4 points in 72 
games last season. Wingate, a second-round pick by Philadelphia in 1986, 
averaged 4.2 points last season and 8.0 in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins averaged 17.7 points through the first 23 games last season before 
developing a nerve problem in his left leg and foot which caused him to miss 50 
of the next 59 games. He wound up with a 14.2 scoring average for the season, 
13 through three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, Dallas' second pick in 1981, has averaged 15.9 points per game through 
eight seasons with several teams. The Spurs acquired him in a four-player deal 
with Denver last Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile George Gervin, a former NBA scoring champion who quit the Spurs two 
years ago amid allegations of drug and alcohol abuse, said he wants to rejoin 
the team. "I'm very serious," Gervin said. "I feel the timing is right. The 
team they have on paper looks great. But I think they're missing a veteran. I 
think I can really help them. I think I can help motivate them." 
</P>
<P>
Spur Coach Larry Brown said he has been contacted by Gervin's advisers, but 
said that they haven't begun contract negotiations with Gervin.

OLYMPIC BID BORDERS ON THEATER OF THE ABSURD; 
</P>
<P>
MANCHESTER OF ENGLAND SEEKS 1996 GAMES DESPITE ATHENS BEING CLEAR FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If one can judge by the questions at a news conference, Robert Scott, the 
Manchester, England, theater owner who serves as chairman of his city's bid 
committee for the 1996 Summer Olympics, should close his latest show before the 
curtain rises. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Considering that Athens is the sentimental favorite, that 
Manchester still must build more than half the required facilities, that soccer 
games in that part of England have been terrorized by hooligans and that the 
United Kingdom's record on apartheid is out of step with most of the rest of 
the world, how can Manchester's candidacy possibly be taken seriously? 
</P>
<P>
"I like being the outsider," Scott said, displaying the same sort of humor that 
served another Englishman, Alfred Hitchcock, so well. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, except for Athens, all of the cities contending for the 1996 Summer 
Olympics appear to be outsiders, although Belgrade, Yugoslavia might be further 
outside than the others considering that its representatives chose not to come 
to the annual International Olympic Committee session here this week. 
</P>
<P>
"They had nothing more to say," said Boris Stankovic of Yugoslavia, who will be 
inducted into the IOC tonight at the session's opening ceremony. But Stankovic 
said Belgrade's bid committee will appear before the IOC when it counts, for 
the election on Sept. 18, 1990 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives from the other five cities bidding -- Athens, 
Atlanta, Manchester, Melbourne and Toronto -- have had more than enough to say 
this week to make up for Belgrade's absence. 
</P>
<P>
None have said it more dogmatically than those from Athens, which advertises 
its bid as the "Golden Olympics." They claim that it is their right to have the 
1996 Summer Games to celebrate the centennial of the revival of the Modern 
Olympics at Athens in 1896. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to history to have the Games in Greece, and all democratic nations 
owe it to Greece because that was the birthplace of democracy," said Miltiades 
Evert, former mayor of Athens who is now Greece's minister of health. 
</P>
<P>
Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Melbourne, reacted to that 
suggestion angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"No city has a right to the Olympic Games," he said. "Every city has a right to 
bid." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Henderson, the chairman of Toronto's bid committee, reacted 
diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
"As we know, Athens has the emotional claim," he said. "But all the cities have 
the right. We wouldn't be bidding unless we had something to give to the 
Olympic movement." (One thing Toronto gave this week was a poster of a moose on 
a 10-meter diving board.) 
</P>
<P>
Scott reacted as he normally does, with candor. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the strength of the Athens Games," he said. "We agree with them that 
they have the historical, sentimental and emotional imperative for the 
centennial Games. They are a very worthy candidate and may be irresistible. I 
make no apologies for saying that. But if that's not exactly what the IOC 
wants, Manchester stands ready." 
</P>
<P>
There is something to recommend all the cities. For instance, IOC President 
Juan Antonio Samaranch has raved about his recent stay in Atlanta's Marriott 
Marquis, calling it the finest hotel he has visited. 
</P>
<P>
Of the bidders here, Toronto's are the only ones who did not bring a video. 
They brought one of their city's best chefs, who prepares lavish buffets each 
day for the IOC members. Toronto's also are the only ones who did not rent a 
hospitality suite. They rented three cabanas an Olympic pin's throw from the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is a sameness to all of the candidates' campaigns. They all 
promise state-of-the-art facilities, rapid transportation, smog-free sky, 
splendid weather, tight but non-oppressive security and billion-dollar or more 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Melbourne plans to spend $13.5 million on its bid for the Games. That compares 
to the bid budgets of $6 million for Athens, $5.3 million for Atlanta, $4.5 
million for Manchester and $6.5 million for Toronto. Asked why their bid is 
more expensive, Melbourne representatives deny that it is. They claim that they 
are the only ones telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But although all the cities have their strong points, they also have 
weaknesses. To their credit, they have tried to meet them head on. For example, 
there are doubts about Athens because of its numerous political factions. All 
were represented Monday at a news conference. There were 15 people on the 
stage.

Whittaker Corp.: The Los Angeles-based aerospace and biotechnology company, 
which is restructuring and selling some operations, reported a $2.6-million 
loss from continuing operations in the third quarter ended July 31, contrasted 
with profit of $2.2 million in the same period last year. Income from 
continuing operations was reduced by a non-recurring pretax charge of $10.2 
million, which included $6.4 million in expenses "incurred in various efforts 
to maximize shareholder value, including efforts to sell the company" as well 
as $3.8 million for canceling employee stock options as part of Whittaker's 
recapitalization. Operating profit from continuing operations for the quarter 
rose 41.5% to $10.5 million. Sales increased 1.9% to $50.8 million. Whittaker 
reported a negative shareholders equity of $57.8 million on July 31 because it 
charged to equity the $280.9 million in cash paid to shareholders as part of 
the restructuring and $2.8 million in expenses from the recapitalization.

<P>
A college student telephones his parents for cash to cover an overdrawn check. 
A friend arrested in the dead of night calls for help in scraping up bail 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, if you're willing to pay the price, you can wire financial aid 
just as corporate deal-makers routinely transfer billions of dollars halfway 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union Corp. remains the solid leader in this growing consumer 
money-transfer business, although rivals are giving it a run for the money. 
</P>
<P>
American Express Co., for example, introduced its MoneyGram service about 1 1/2 
years ago. Smaller companies serve specific regions or groups ranging from 
gamblers to truckers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Idea of Speed' 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks also wire money, and even the U.S. Postal Service is 
considering a high-speed money order service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the whole idea of speed. Consumers rely more and more on getting things 
done faster," said Jay Giesen, a vice president of marketing at the American 
Express Information Services Co. subsidiary. "The consumer market has yet to be 
fully tapped." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to do just that, American Express just began its first advertising blitz 
for the service recently. Like the company's pitch for traveler's checks, the 
MoneyGram ads appeal to people's fears. 
</P>
<P>
One shows a broke American teen-ager stranded on the steps of a European church 
on a cold, stormy night. Another shows an elderly couple evidently distraught 
over an unexpected financial hardship. A third shows a mother and daughter 
stuck at a remote bus station. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union, which has been in the money-transfer business since 1871, is 
countering with a beefed-up ad campaign that includes a TV spot showing a 
succession of mothers complaining about their children's spending habits. The 
light-hearted ad includes a new toll-free number for sending money by phone. 
</P>
<P>
All that competition could spell good news for harried, bargain-hunting 
consumers who need to send or receive cash fast. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest and easiest way to gain access to emergency cash is through the 
bank automated teller machine network, where fees on transactions range from 10 
cents to $3. Many are free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limits Cited 
</P>
<P>
But one major problem with this system is that daily cash withdrawals usually 
are limited to $200 to $500. Another drawback is that not everyone has an 
automated bank card. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many households in this country that don't even have checking 
accounts," said Western Union spokesman Warren R. Bechtel. 
</P>
<P>
For them, the main way to send fast emergency cash, albeit expensive, is via 
the transmission service. Many Western Union and American Express agents are 
open 24 hours; their telephone numbers are available in the yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
Only Western Union allows customers to send money over the telephone, although 
it tacks on an extra finance charge. American Express says it has no finance 
charge, but all transactions must be done in person. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union has a computerized network of 13,500 agents nationwide, including 
many all-night convenience stores, supermarkets, hardware stores and hotels. 
American Express has nearly 7,000 agents. 
</P>
<P>
Western Union says it wired around $3 billion last year, with the average 
transaction at $300. American Express doesn't release these figures but says 
its volume has risen steadily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convenience Costs 
</P>
<P>
Both companies promise money will be available domestically at the receiving 
agent within 15 minutes. MoneyGram, however, claims to offer more flexibility 
about where the money can be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
For these conveniences you must pay the price. Western Union and American 
Express have graduated fee scales, where the more you send the less you pay 
percentage-wise. But be careful: In some cases if you send a penny over the 
limit you'll end up in the next bracket and pay a substantially higher fee. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it costs $12 to send up to $50 via Western Union, or 24% of the 
principal amount. The fee rises to $14 for sending $50.01 to $100; to $21 for 
$101.01 to $200; and to $27 for $300.01 to $400. The fee levels off at $3,000, 
costing $105, or 3.5% of the principal amount. Above that each additional $500 
or fraction thereof costs $20. Western Union says it doesn't limit the amount 
of money that can be sent. 
</P>
<P>
For the MoneyGram service, fees range from $9 for sending up to $50, or 18% of 
the principal amount, to $330 for sending a maximum $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wiring money from bank to bank is often much cheaper, with the sending bank 
charging from $10 to $20, but this service is only available during banking 
hours.

JACK SMITH: WORKING UP AN APPETITE FOR LETHARGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Aspen Airways in-flight magazine lists "99 reasons to visit Aspen in the 
summertime" -- among them white-water rafting, gliding, biking, ballooning, 
horseback riding, llama trekking, backpacking and buying 22,009 different 
souvenir T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
We were in Aspen a week and about the only recommended activity we tried was 
buying T-shirts. But we only bought five -- one each for our grandchildren. 
Most of Aspen's retail stores are located in the central mall. I'm not sure 
whether there are more T-shirt stores or restaurants. But there is no dearth of 
either. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, we had come to Aspen to catch the final week of its famous summer 
music festival, and on the first day we attended a "chamber music master class" 
in the Wheeler Opera House, at $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
The opera house, in the mall, is 100 years old, and gloriously restored. The 
program was curious. First, a young string quartet played pieces by Handel and 
Debussy (quite adequately, I thought); but then the four members of the 
American String Quartet, who had been playing together for 17 years, marched up 
on the stage and began picking the novices apart like so many predatory birds 
picking at insects. 
</P>
<P>
They would let the group play a few bars, and then descend on them, the first 
violinist picking on the first violinist, the cellist picking on the cellist, 
and so on. "No, no! Not that way!. Like this! Tum te dum te dum!," making the 
motions of playing the violin, cello or viola, as appropriate. Some of the 
younger players seemed in shock, or laughed nervously, but kept on. "Of course 
we've all been through this ourselves," said the veteran first violinist to 
ease the hurt. 
</P>
<P>
I felt for the younger group, but I didn't doubt that they would profit from 
their painful lesson. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, we dined early in the Charlemagne, a French restaurant in a 
Victorian house (the prevailing style in Aspen), and went to a chamber music 
concert in the tent ($20), which is the principal theater of the festival. It 
is exactly that -- a tent. 
</P>
<P>
A pianist played a Beethoven concerto, and three young violinists played 
difficult concertos accompanied by the student orchestra. Their skills seemed 
well advanced to me. Then, much to our gratification, the American String 
Quartet itself came out to play two extremely demanding pieces that gave them a 
chance to demonstrate their virtuosity and justify their exacting criticisms of 
the younger group that morning. Everything is relative. 
</P>
<P>
Besides buying T-shirts, we did another of the 99 things that were given as 
reasons for visiting Aspen in the summertime. We ate. Mealtime kept rushing up 
on us, whether we were hungry or not. After two days of breakfasting on bacon 
and eggs in restaurants, we bought some milk, cereal, bananas and muffins at 
the 24-hour market, and ate breakfast in after that. 
</P>
<P>
We subsided into a shameful lethargy. I don't think we went to another concert, 
although there was always something going on. We merely lay about our 
condominium, reading the erotic novels that had been fortuitously left there, 
and waiting for mealtime to come around again. Our biggest problem was where to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
Our condominium was right next to the tennis courts, and my sense of lassitude 
was accented by the daylong plunk of tennis balls struck by those more 
energetic than me. 
</P>
<P>
I watched from our balcony one morning while the pro was giving lessons to a 
girl of about 8. He would pat a ball to her forehand, and she would bat it over 
the fence into the flower beds. "That's all right," he would assure her, and 
pat another ball to her backhand. Probably the way Chris Evert started, I 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before lunch time we would walk to the mall to work up an appetite. I 
usually sat on a bench while my wife went shopping. I doubt that there is 
anything you can't buy in the Aspen mall -- from skis and leather pants to 
artworks and Oriental rugs. 
</P>
<P>
I was content to sit and read. I went into a bookstore and paid $17.95 for 
Robert B. Parker's "Playmates," only to discover three minutes later, out on 
the bench, that I had already read it. I went back and exchanged it for "Polar 
Star" by Martin Cruz Smith, which cost $2.15 cents more.

<P>
A THEATRICAL VIEW OF THE ART OF 'THE DEAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except that the title has already been taken, Matthew Witten's "The Deal" at 
the Back Alley Theatre could have been called "The Sting." It traces a 
small-town FBI set-up that goes awry, and it doesn't end with 19 rounds of 
gunfire. This is theater, not TV. 
</P>
<P>
Good theater, too. Witten writes tight and sticks to the evidence, rather like 
his hero, an FBI agent named Peter, not Pete (John M. Jackson). Peter is trying 
to get the goods on Jimmy, a two-bit ward boss (Michael Cavanaugh). With luck 
he'll also land Tommy (Charles Siebert), who does favors for people out of the 
State Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Peter pretends to be representing a developer who needs to be sure there'll be 
no trouble bringing a new hotel to town. A few drinks with Jimmy establishes 
his price, and Tommy is also "in." Peter gets the whole deal down on tape, and 
his boss, Alex (Will Nye), is elated. He hasn't had an arrest in years. 
</P>
<P>
Then the stingers get stung. Never mind how, but Witten gives us a clever scene 
that shows how a real operator -- Tommy -- operates. Meanwhile actor Siebert is 
making an equally important point: Tommy adores being an operator. For him, 
beating the system is a game. That's why he's so good at it. 
</P>
<P>
That used to be true of Peter, the FBI man, too. But actor Jackson establishes 
his increasing distaste for this business of tempting people beyond their moral 
limits. Maybe it's not technically entrapment, but it is a kind of betrayal. 
And there's evidence that Jimmy, the small-timer, has never taken a bribe 
before. Peter doesn't want to be the one to break him in. 
</P>
<P>
"The Deal" doesn't go on and on about Peter's bad conscience, but we're always 
aware of it, and it makes the evening not just another cop show. It does move 
quickly, though. Witten makes imaginative use of the device of the tape 
recorder -- scenes that we think are being played for the first time turn out 
to be "on tape," and therefore repeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Director Allan Miller adds a freeze-frame gimmick at the beginning and end of 
each act, and paces the action very briskly. Result: a taut show. 
</P>
<P>
Act I was too taut on Sunday night. Guys making deals left a lot unsaid, even 
when they don't know there's a tape recorder hidden under somebody's coat, and 
Witten's dialogue leaves room for the implications of a seemingly innocent 
phrase to register -- "It'll be taken care of," "Are you the guy to see?" etc. 
</P>
<P>
But they won't register if the play is taken at too rapid a clip, as applied 
for the first hour Sunday. Not until after intermission did Miller's actors 
settle down to their subtext, after which they were in -- although Cavanaugh 
could find more color in Jimmy without making him any less the patsy. 
</P>
<P>
In all, however, Witten's play is a good deal for audiences who want a 
clear-cut drama about how unclear-cut life is getting to be these days -- how 
hard it's getting to be to tell the bad guys from the good guys. What good 
guys?

BOX-OFFICE SHORT CIRCUIT FOR 'WIRED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Monday morning, in the wake of the weekend death of the movie "Wired" at 680 
theaters, the late John Belushi's one-time Blues Brothers partner was still 
urging moviegoers to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are exploiting my dead friend," Dan Aykroyd told CBS' "This 
Morning" co-host Harry Smith. "Of course I'm going to take a position." 
</P>
<P>
"Wired," a $13.5-million movie based on Bob Woodward's book about the life and 
death of the drug-addicted Belushi, grossed only $681,000 during the weekend 
for a disastrous per-screen average of $1,001. It is one of the poorest 
openings of any nationally released film this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to see the movie, it's that simple," said an executive of one 
theater chain. "You can't say people didn't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Wired" has been the subject of controversy ever since producers Ed Feldman and 
Charles Meeker obtained the rights to Woodward's book four years ago. Aykroyd 
was just one of many Belushi friends offended by the book and opposed to a 
movie version, and pressure had reportedly been applied by Creative Artists 
Agency, which handled Belushi and represents Aykroyd, to stop the film from 
being made and then distributed. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was turned down for distribution by every major American distribution 
company and by most independents. New Visions Pictures had agreed to distribute 
it, according to the "Wired" producers, but pulled out (the company is run by 
Taylor Hackford, a CAA client). When Atlantic Entertainment ran into financial 
problems after agreeing to distribute "Wired," tiny Taurus Entertainment, a 
division of United Artists, assumed the task. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, "Wired" got caught up in one last gust of controversy when rumors 
began circulating that major theater chains were being pressured to dump 
bookings of the picture. Despite the denials of theater chains and the 
inability of "Wired" producers to identify specific booking cancellations, the 
rumors received widespread media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-TV film critic Gary Franklin went on the air last Tuesday and reported 
that both Pacific Theaters and Cineplex Odeon had dropped bookings of "Wired" 
in Los Angeles. The next evening, he corrected himself. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, in a story about murdered video executive Jose Menendez, whose company 
has the video rights to "Wired," the Wall Street Journal reported that, "in 
what may only be a strange coincidence," full-page ads announcing the opening 
of "Wired" appeared in newspapers in L.A. and New York on the day of the 
killing of Menendez and his wife. The Journal went on to report that the day 
after the Aug. 20 murders, "several theater chains canceled 'Wire.' " "It's 
ludicrous for anyone to believe an agency can stop us from opening a movie," an 
executive with Cineplex Odeon said Monday. "One year ago today, we opened 'The 
Last Temptation of Christ.' We're not afraid of anything." 
</P>
<P>
At least one major chain -- New York-based Loews -- rejected "Wired" from the 
beginning, according to the film's producers. Loews is owned by Columbia 
Pictures Inc., whose two studios -- Columbia and Tri-Star -- are heavy users of 
CAA clients. 
</P>
<P>
Most exhibitors contacted by The Times said "Wired" was not booked widely 
because it was not a very good movie and there were too many major films still 
doing good business.

CITY OF 'LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION';

<P>
WHEN PARISIANS MOVE OUT, FILM MAKERS MOVE IN

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent morning here, American television star Sandy Duncan pushed a stunt 
man into the Seine River after whacking him on the head with an umbrella, part 
of an action sequence for the season opener of her TV sitcom "The Hogan 
Family." 
</P>
<P>
The same spot on the river along the Quai Montebello below Notre Dame Cathedral 
was reserved a few days later for Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward to stroll 
hand-in-hand in their new film "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," about a couple from 
Kansas City who raise a family, drift apart and finally reach terms of 
endearment while vacationing in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, positioned precariously atop the sloping, bronze dome of the 
National Opera house, British actor Charles Dance, who stars with Burt 
Lancaster in a four-hour American television production of "The Phantom of the 
Opera," practiced swirling his cape as technicians scrambled to build safety 
nets to keep him from falling 226 feet into the street below. 
</P>
<P>
The "Phantom" rehearsals were interrupted briefly when the crew was distracted 
by another production of a smaller scale. A man with a shoulder-held camera was 
filming two naked women cavorting on the rooftop of a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
August in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time of year when many Parisians roll out of town on their annual 
summer vacations and film crews, encouraged by a movie-mad mayor, roll in from 
all over the world. August is ideal for film making because the streets of the 
French capital are much less congested, thus solving what is the biggest 
headache for location managers working in old European cities: finding a place 
to park for the trailers, vans and portable commissaries that accompany the big 
productions like army supply trains. 
</P>
<P>
This year's crop of August filmings has an especially American flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many more American productions in Paris right now than I can 
remember," said director Roman Polanski, a Paris resident who has made several 
films here including his most recent, "Frantic." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the "The Hogan Family" and "Phantom," both for NBC, there are 
three feature films on location here: the Newman-Woodward film under the 
direction of James Ivory; a Philippe Setbon-directed film starring Jeff 
Goldblum entitled "Mr. Frost," and "Henry and June," a film by director Philip 
Kaufman based on the affair between authors Henry Miller and Anais Nin. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Paris the first choice of directors, of course, are the obvious 
charms of the city itself, one of the few European capitals that suffered 
almost no damage during World War II and which consequently has relatively few 
modern buildings to disturb the authenticity of period films. 
</P>
<P>
Cinema, after all, was invented here at the turn of the century by the Lumiere 
brothers. Director George Melies invented special effects when a horse-drawn 
trolley he was filming at the Place de l'Opera moved during a camera breakdown 
and was replaced by a hearse, giving the impression once the film was developed 
that the trolley had actually become a hearse. Voila, the birth of accidental 
symbolism! The first movie Westerns were not made in the San Fernando Valley 
but in the Bois de Vincennes, on the edge of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Paris claims to be the "most filmed city in the world," with an average of 10 
location filmings, ranging from television commercials to full-length features, 
taking place every day in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see," said Francoise Jacquier, thumbing through a spiral notebook 
centered on the desk of her attic office at the Paris City Hall. "Today they 
are filming at Notre Dame; in the Bois de Boulogne; in an apartment in the 16th 
Arrondissement, the Avenue Victor Hugo; at Les Halles, and on the roof of the 
Opera. It's a light day." 
</P>
<P>
Jacquier, a former stage actress who is known in the Paris film trade as 
"Madame Cinema," is a special liaison at City Hall in charge of obtaining 
authorizations for location filmings in Paris. She was appointed to the job by 
Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, an avid movie fan who often stays at the home of 
his friend Gregory Peck when he visits Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquier promises a response to film producers for their location requests in 
24 hours and she is the one who deals primarily with the dozens of police 
prefects, park authorities, church officials and private businesses that get in 
the way of making movies. In 1985, the official government publication house 
listed 80 different bodies with power to issue authorizations for filming. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of Jacquier's skillful interventions, however, directors say 
working in Paris is relatively easy, despite the mountains of rules. Producer 
Ismail Merchant, for example, teamed again with director James Ivory to make 
"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," said he had no trouble getting permission to become the 
first movie maker in history to film inside the two main galleries of the 
Louvre Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"They welcome you with open arms to make movies here," Merchant enthused, 
although only the day before, in a tense moment, the French Ministry of Culture 
had threatened to shut down his production in retaliation for a visa problem 
with a French director working in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there is a great deal of red tape," director Polanski said during a 
recent lunch at Fouquet's, the movie-industry hangout on the Avenue des 
Champs-Elysees. "As you know, France still lives under the yoke of Napoleonic 
bureaucracy, which has evolved very little. Production managers complain a 
great deal. But once you get those permissions, shooting is very easy. I've had 
all the help in the world shooting in the city of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"They are even great knowing that you are not going to show their city in the 
best light. You remember that 'Frantic' was not exactly a tourist's dream." (In 
the film, Harrison Ford plays an American doctor who comes to Paris for a 
medical convention only to have his wife kidnaped while the Paris police yawn 
with indifference.) 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that shooting films in Paris is free of politics. 
For days, Sandrine Ageorges, a production manager for the "Phantom" movie, 
attempted to get the floodlights turned off on the roof of the Grand Hotel that 
are used to illuminate the opera building. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Jacquier at the mayor's office called with permission. The lights, 
after all, are controlled by Mayor Chirac. But the building and presenting it 
to the public are the province of Minister of Culture Jack Lang, who has 
authority over historic sites. Lang, as it turned out, would not have the 
historic building darkened, even for a few hours. Permission was rescinded. 
Ageorges, of course, smelled politics. Mayor Chirac is a leader of the Gaullist 
opposition party (RPR). Lang is a senior minister in the ruling Socialist 
Party. Occasionally, she said, the Socialists like to remind the people in the 
Paris city government not to let the movie-making business go to their head. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the French bureaucracy always above politics when wielding its movie 
location authority as a way to fight back at the actions of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
This was obvious with nearly disastrous results recently when the government 
threatened to halt filming on "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" the day before shooting was 
to begin on the Quai Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
French film director Elie Chouraqui, actor Richard Anconina and a 12-man 
technical crew were in the United States to make a French film entitled "Miss 
Missouri." While on location in Kansas City, they went to the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service office to obtain work visas. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure in such situations is for the INS to ask an expert authority, in 
this case the Directors Guild in Los Angeles, to certify that the applicant 
(Chouraqui) is a director of "distinguished merit and authority." Ostensibly 
because the Directors Guild was unaware of some of Chouraqui's more successful 
movies, the certification was denied, the request sent back with copies of some 
bad reviews for his earlier films. The visa was denied. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials close to the case, however, speculated that the real reason for 
the guild's response may have had more to do with the French director's failure 
to hire an American crew or staff. French newspapers suggested that the denial 
also may have been motivated by the American film industry's simmering anger 
over proposed quotas for American productions in Europe after 1992, when the 12 
nations of the European Community, merging their economies into a single 
market, will adopt uniform film standards. 
</P>
<P>
French authorities made it clear to the U.S. Embassy in Paris that unless 
Chouraqui were granted a visa, "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" could not be made in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict flared anew Friday when Chirac actually suspended filming in Paris 
for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Following the intervention of Motion Picture Assn. of America President Jack 
Valenti and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), among other personages, a 
visa was obtained for Chouraqui. Visas for the rest of the French production 
were promised. For his part, Chouraqui pledged to scout around for American 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Newman-Woodward film was allowed to roll. 
</P>
<P>
"For 48 hours it was a rough situation," said the film's French co-producer, 
Hubert Balsan. "We were threatened with retaliation. It was the most 
extraordinary thing I have seen in France." 
</P>
<P>
Such tense moments over a film are a rarity in Paris, where almost anything 
goes in the movies, particularly in the month of August. 
</P>
<P>
French officials are much more likely to complain that Americans do not make 
enough movies in Paris or do not use enough of the city as a cinematic canvas. 
The only recent denials on record at City Hall, outside of normal concerns 
about blocking traffic or interfering with public transportation, were to 
requests to film a swimsuit sequence at the giant Pere Lachaise Cemetery and 
for a group sex scene at the underground catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably," said Paris cinema czar Jacquier, "Americans usually only film 
touristic Paris -- the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame." But if any American wants 
to come to Paris and make the city, warts and all, the "star" of the movie: 
</P>
<P>
"I promise I will give them total help."

Gary Dee, a controversial AM radio personality who was fired from previous jobs 
in New York, Chicago and Washington, believes the ax has fallen again, this 
time in Cleveland. The WWWE talk show host hasn't been on the air since Aug. 
18, after being suspended indefinitely, with pay, because of a complaint filed 
with the Federal Communications Commission alleging on-air indecency. The FCC 
says it has an 18-page complaint against Dee, accompanied by tapes of his 
shows, but will not say what the complaint is about or who filed it. Dee told 
the Cleveland Plain Dealer over the weekend he now thinks he has been fired, 
although station management has been telling listeners he is "on vacation." 
Dee, who once told an elderly woman on the air to "gargle with razor blades, 
you old barracuda," began his broadcasting career in 1964 at KGEN in Tulare, 
Calif., and went to KMAK in Fresno in 1968. He joined WWWE 20 months ago to 
host a mid-afternoon talk show. ALEENE MacMINN

Gone in an Instant: Singer Paul McCartney's Nov. 27-29 concert dates at the 
Forum were near-instant sellouts Monday, so tickets were put on sale for two 
additional dates: Nov. 23 (Thanksgiving) and Nov. 24. They immediately sold 
out, too. A spokeswoman for the promoter, Parc Presentations, said no more 
dates would be added to the engagement, which will be the tour's only Southern 
California stop. McCartney's last local appearance was a three-night stand at 
the Forum in June, 1976. ALEENE MacMINN

The skull of a bear has been unearthed on the site of the Elizabethan Rose 
Theater in London where William Shakespeare is believed to have acted and near 
where bear-baiting was first recorded in the 1500s. The animal was believed to 
be a mature adult European brown bear, and the skull appeared to have come from 
a ditch that contained debris dating from 1587-1606, when the Rose Theater was 
flourishing. The discovery of the skull may indicate the Rose was used for 
entertainment other than drama. Bears were taken to Britain to undergo attacks 
by dogs for the entertainment of paying spectators. The foundations of the Rose 
were discovered earlier this year during demolition to build an office. ALEENE

KIROV DANCES ITS FAREWELL BILL IN O.C. WITH CAST, PROGRAM JUGGLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Expect consistent inconsistency from the Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Several announced casting decisions were rescinded at the company's final 
performance of the season, Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. Some previously danced variations in "Paquita" were also dropped, 
reportedly on last-minute orders from artistic director Oleg Vinogradov. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this company and its audience had no reason to grow complacent, even 
on the closing program of the 1989 U.S. tour. And if one of the surprises 
proved devastating -- Igor Petrov certainly represented no substitute at all 
for Farukh Ruzimatov in the "Don Quixote" pas de deux -- there were also 
undeniable compensations. 
</P>
<P>
Start with Zhanna Ayupova in the Pavlova role of "Chopiniana," a performance 
treasurable for its exquisite refinement and deep sense of personal 
involvement. Dance historians often summarize this ballet as the Youth's dream, 
but Ayupova danced it with a sweet, secret smile as if it were her own. 
Replacing the announced Kiril Melnikov as the Youth, Yuri Zhukov returned to 
the cast in his last performance with the Kirov before joining San Francisco 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
In the abridged "Paquita" festivities, Tatiana Terekhova danced the prima role 
with her usual majestic radiance. She looked unusually forced, perhaps, in 
supported bravura (partnered by Eldar Aliev), but typically precise and at ease 
in her solos. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Chistiakova lost her "Paquita" solo but pertly danced the "Fairy Doll" 
trio (opposite Andrei Garbuz and Andrei Bosov), capitalizing on her very steady 
balances. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Don Quixote" duet, Elena Pankova not only danced the familiar fan 
variation instead of the alternate solo seen Friday (with Terekhova), she also 
carried the fan through her fouette marathon -- and cooled herself with it. 
This wasn't exactly polished classical dancing, but the emphasis on sheer speed 
and bravado yielded great excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar principals in the White Swan pas de deux and "The Dying Swan" 
completed the program. Victor Fedotov conducted. 
</P>
<P>
No farewells, no encores.

GENESIS MAINSTAY PROVES CRAFTSMAN IN OWN BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What is it that the bumper sticker says: "When the going gets weird, the weird 
turn pro"? If there is any credence to that, the '80s must be one weird time. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, Genesis was about as odd and cultish a band as one could ask for, 
unless one was into trepanned skull caps and lyrics in Esperanto. Peter Gabriel 
sported a reverse Mohawk and sang about playing croquet with human heads, while 
the band reveled in quasiclassical art-rock excursions. The closest thing to an 
outside career pursued by any of the group was drummer Phil Collins' 
polyrhythmic visits with the even more avant-garde Brand X. 
</P>
<P>
Collins has since developed a grindingly effective pop sensibility, and Gabriel 
has proved that he can hit the Top 10 while still keeping a foot in uncharted 
territory, but it may yet be Genesis' unassuming bassist-guitarist, Mike 
Rutherford, who proves the most canny pop craftsman of the bunch. The music his 
Mike + the Mechanics brought to the Pacific Amphitheatre on Sunday never veered 
from the mainstream of accessible, radio-ready pop, yet the six-piece group 
packed a lot of feeling and content into that limited form. 
</P>
<P>
It helped in no small amount that the Mechanics include one of Britain's most 
soulful singers, Paul Carrack (the voice of Ace's pub-rock classic "How Long" 
and Squeeze's "Tempted"). Combined with fellow vocalist Paul Young (no, not the 
Paul Young) and a rich choral backing from most of the band, the emphasis on 
voice kept the 13-song set tilted toward the human and emotional. 
</P>
<P>
That was not always without effort. In addition to the electronic drums, guitar 
synthesizers and such, many of the songs used pre-programmed bass and rhythm 
tracks. While that beefed the arrangements to match the group's studio sound, 
it also lent a locked-in, clinical feeling to some songs. But even when 
particularly at odds with the feel of the material, as on the ballad "Nobody 
Knows," the warmth of Carrack's rough-grained voice won out. 
</P>
<P>
More of an overt showman, Young was best singing on the up-tempo "All I Need Is 
a Miracle" and "Taken In." Aside from a loud jacket, bandleader Rutherford was 
scarcely less taciturn than when he performs with Genesis, only singing backup 
and leaving most of the flash guitar work to Tim Renwick. 
</P>
<P>
When Rutherford did solo, as on "Nobody Knows," it was typically with an 
understated melody that served the song rather than stood out from it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mechanics' songs can be fairly devious things, packing more intent than the 
standard radio fare. Live, "Silent Running" came off as a forceful, angry 
statement against the institutions that control peoples' destinies (curiously, 
an encore version of the Beatles' "Revolution" seemed wan and lifeless). 
</P>
<P>
The show's real depth charge was Carrack's vocal on the hit "The Living Years," 
a genuinely touching ballad about bridging the generations. It also presented 
the evening's greatest man-vs.-technology challenge, as Carrack had to work 
against a pre-recorded majestic chorus that flew in the face of the direct, 
"eye-to-eye" message of the lyric. 
</P>
<P>
Outfield, the opening band, had its most entertaining moment during the 
Mechanics' performance, when its three members sprinted across the stage in a 
bit of last-night-of-the-tour glee, wearing only towels and shaving cream. They 
might as well have been wearing diapers during their own set, which sounded 
like nothing so much as a watered-down version of the Babys' preambulant pop.

THEATER AND FILM / MARK CHALON SMITH: IMPRESARIO DISILLUSIONED BY POOR 
PATRONAGE AT THEATER FOR NEW PLAYS, PLANS CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Jeffrey Ault knew it would be risky opening a theater in Orange County devoted 
to new plays by mostly local writers. But even now, with the tiny house 
expected to close by the end of the year, Ault is surprised by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Cal State Fullerton drama student envisioned Illusion's New 
View Theatre, a 39-seat playhouse in one corner of a Fullerton mini-mall, as 
filling a void in the local stage scene. South Coast Repertory does the major 
work, the Grove Shakespeare Festival handles the Bard and Alternative Repertory 
Theatre in Santa Ana revives rarely seen pieces. But none of these troupes 
consistently provides area playwrights with a forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought it would go because there is no other outlet in O.C. I 
thought it would be something they'd welcome," Ault said. "I was very wrong." 
</P>
<P>
After about 15 months of meager attendance, the $12,000 in seed money long gone 
and his lease with the mall landlord in jeopardy, Ault said Illusion's will 
permanently close by year's end. At least one more show will be staged: Tom 
Rooney's romantic comedy "How To," opening Friday and continuing until Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's latest offering of two one-acts has been drawing only 10 to 12 
people a night, about half the number of people Ault would need to break even. 
As with earlier productions, there was a general pattern of decent sales in the 
first week or two, followed by a steady decline. 
</P>
<P>
Why hasn't Orange County supported him? Ault isn't sure, but he points to the 
region's conservatism and its interest in art with a traditional focus as major 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think people would want to see fresh plays, like they can in Los 
Angeles, but I guess they're just not ready for this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
That's true, to a certain extent. With the exception of SCR (and occasionally 
the Grove), Orange County is a land of revivals, where what is proven flies and 
what is unproven often dies. 
</P>
<P>
Most community theaters flourish by offering playbills heavy with veteran hits. 
Many local stage fans want a guarantee on their tickets, and new works can't 
carry that promise. It's unfortunate that patrons aren't asking for more 
adventurous fare, that they aren't setting the trend toward challenges. 
</P>
<P>
But if Ault misread the local audience, he also was naive in assuming that 
people would come simply because he took chances. Most of Illusion's offerings 
were experimental, quirky and often provocative, but most were also vague and 
messy in theme and content. Good writers and good plays are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even with the problems in play choices, the ideal Ault embraced is not 
only brave but justified. Within that framework, something powerful may have 
emerged. Without such an arena, that possibility is removed. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, Ault hasn't given up on Orange County. Although he has no plans 
to open another theater, he does hope to stage some productions, possibly in 
Irvine. Besides that, he will work as a free-lance set designer both here and 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ault insists that, even in hindsight, he would not have done anything 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Not even, say, toss in a Neil Simon comedy to plump up the receipts? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we thought about doing a revival but quickly abandoned the idea. We had 
an artistic direction, and we wanted to stick to it. If you start compromising, 
you just start having problems in the long run. Even though we're closing, I'm 
glad we stuck by that." 
</P>
<P>
AND NOW, THE GOOD NEWS: Alternative Repertory Theatre, the 61-seat playhouse in 
an industrial mall in Santa Ana, announced that it has enough money to embark 
on a new four-play season, beginning Sept. 29 with Aristophanes' anti-war 
comedy "Lysistrata." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Kathleen Bryson said a recent fund-raiser brought in about $4,000, 113 
season subscriptions have already been sold, both of which will allow the 
theater to remain open for at least one more year. Bryson noted that the 
theater eventually expects to have more than 300 subscribers and will pursue 
nonprofit tax status as another way to trim costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have finally turned the corner," she said. "We had this wonderful 
parking lot sale where we sold stuff from plastic flowers for a nickel to a VCR 
for $100. That really helped, and with the public's support, I think we're 
going to do all right." 
</P>
<P>
The theater still depends on walk-up ticket sales for each production, which 
costs about $6,000, but the $4,000 is "a nice cushion to have," she said. She 
added that ticket purchases have been rising as the playhouse becomes better 
known in Orange County and in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson said she never seriously considered closing ART. "When things were 
blackest, we took a long hard look at our future and decided this was something 
we had to do. Orange County needs a place to see the types of plays we want to 
produce." 
</P>
<P>
As with Illusion's, stage reviewers haven't always been charmed by its 
productions, but there has been consistent respect for what the theater is 
trying to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative schedule, "Lysistrata" will be followed with Beckett's 
"Waiting for Godot," then the West Coast premiere of Lorna C. Hill's "Yalla 
Bitch." A festival featuring segments of various plays will be the last 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
TITLES BESTOWED: South Coast Repertory has named its first three associate 
artists, a new title given to playwrights, directors and designers with a 
continuing relationship with the Costa Mesa company. The associate artists join 
the existing categories for actors of founding artists and resident artists, 
according to SCR directors David Emmes and Martin Benson. The three are David 
Chambers, a director; Michael Devine, a designer, and Craig Lucas, a 
playwright. Although the new title carries no formal commitment, Emmes said, it 
does signify "a mutual respect and intention to continue working together 
whenever possible."

ABC SUMMONS SERIES STARS FOR 'JURY DUTY: THE COMEDY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

"I received a summons for jury duty yesterday, but the producer got me off," 
Barbara Bosson said. She couldn't serve because she was already busy in court. 
In a TV movie that recently completed production in Los Angeles, she is one of 
15 current and former ABC series performers pondering the verdict in a case in 
which a character played by ABC star Bronson Pinchot stands accused of 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Jury Duty: The Comedy," a sort of trailer for half of ABC's series lineup, 
will air early this fall. The movie takes a comic swipe at that most American 
of traditions -- being tried by a jury of your peers. 
</P>
<P>
Casting so many series stars in a TV movie to air early in the season sounds 
like a classic marketing ploy. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't, insisted Allen Sabinson, ABC's vice president of motion pictures for 
television and miniseries. He prefers to call it a "wonderfully synergistic" 
move: " 'Jury Duty: The Comedy' will help our series and our series will help 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Using such stars as Alan Thicke of "Growing Pains," Lynn Redgrave of the 
upcoming "Chicken Soup" and Pinchot of "Perfect Strangers" cost a lot, said 
executive producer Steve White, who refused to reveal "Jury Duty's" budget or 
the amount allotted to the actors. 
</P>
<P>
"(These actors) are the cream of the crop. Let's just say that the budget and 
the cast are at the high end of what these movies cost." 
</P>
<P>
William Schilling, who plays the principal on "Head of the Class" and an 
out-of-work teacher called for jury duty here, said: "They don't have to give 
us lots of money because we have regular jobs. We can come here and play comedy 
without fear of unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
In "Jury Duty," Pinchot plays a mild-mannered accountant who is on trial for 
embezzlement. Defending him is Bill Kirchenbauer of "Just the Ten of Us." 
Prosecuting him is Jacklyn Zeman of "General Hospital"; the chief prosecution 
witness is Tracy Scoggins, formerly of "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the cast with ABC connections: Ilene Graff of "Mr. Belvedere," Danny 
Pintauro of "Who's the Boss?," Stephen Baldwin of "The Young Riders," Reginald 
VelJohnson of "Family Matters," Joshua Rifkind of the midseason entry "The 
Marshall Chronicles" and Madchen Amik of another midseason show, "Twin Peaks" 
-- plus Bosson, from the now-canceled "Hooperman," and Heather Locklear, from 
the similarly defunct "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Pinchot needed some persuading to do the movie. "When they sent me the script, 
I said, 'No, no, no! This accountant is too plain-Jane," he said. "These other 
parts (a concierge, a shy, middle-aged Middle Eastern woman and a Geraldo 
Rivera-type reporter) are more interesting. So they digitally enhanced them for 
me." He plays all four roles in the film. 
</P>
<P>
He was available for "Jury Duty," Pinchot explained, "because of the writers' 
strike last year. We didn't know when our hiatus would be so I couldn't set up 
a feature. So I told my agent to call the networks. ABC said that if I'd do 
'Jury Duty,' they'd develop a TV movie for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ensemble comedy projects periodically appear on television, although ABC has 
not made one recently. "It's the type of movie I'd done at NBC," said White, 
who was head of TV movies there before starting his own production company. "I 
like doing ensemble comedy. Very rarely do a bunch of leading comedy actors get 
to be in a true ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like camp," Thicke said. "It's fast, furious and fun. I try to work for 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave, who co-stars with Jackie Mason in the new series "Chicken Soup," 
agreed to do "Jury Duty" because, she said, "from a performing point of view, 
it's nice to be one of the gang. It happens less and less. We all like to play 
leading roles, and we like the challenge and responsibility. Here no one has 
too much more than anyone else, so there's no petty jealousy. And for once it 
doesn't seem like gratuitous casting. The actors are terrifically suited to 
their roles." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Bosson couldn't wait to play what she described as "a wacko psychic. I 
had all these visions of looking like Madame Arcati (the medium in Noel 
Coward's 'Blithe Spirit'). But the producers said, 'No. Just be you, psychic.' 
They wanted people the audience could identify with. Because the case we're 
hearing is so broad, they tried to have the jurors as realistic as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they cast me as a prostitute," joked Locklear, fingering her short 
blond hair. "I thought that at least they'd put a wig on me." 
</P>
<P>
Locklear and Bosson were among the few major cast members who did not have a 
series to return to this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara and I figure 'Jury Duty' could be a pilot for a series for us," 
Locklear said, tongue in cheek. "Every week we could be on a different jury 
together." 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't work out, they may be back next year in "Jury Duty: The 
Sequel."

NEW EFFORT TO MEASURE LATINO TV MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
PILOT PROJECT TO START NEXT MONTH IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

How many Latinos watch Spanish-language television? In these days of instant 
ratings, one might think it's an easy question to answer. But to hear the 
nation's two biggest Spanish-language TV networks and the advertising industry 
tell it, no one is sure. 
</P>
<P>
And that's a quandary with big financial consequences for the two New 
York-based networks, Univision Holdings and Telemundo Group. They are unhappy 
about getting only 1% of the $30 billion spent on TV advertising each year, 
when Latinos account for nearly 10% of the U.S. population and -- according to 
U.S. Census Bureau estimates -- will have disposable income of $172 billion in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
But potential advertisers want better proof of Latino TV viewership before they 
pump money into the networks' programming, and they claim that the ratings 
currently available show a muddled picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's this kind of debate that no one has been able to win," said J. William 
Grimes, president of Univision, a unit of Hallmark Cards Inc., which owns 
KMEX-TV Channel 34 in Los Angeles and eight other Spanish-language stations 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surveys Latino Tastes 
</P>
<P>
So early this month, Univision and Telemundo -- a unit of Reliance Group 
Holdings that owns KVEA-TV Channel 52 in Los Angeles and four other stations -- 
decided to end the debate. They hired A. C. Nielsen, the well-known TV ratings 
specialist, to develop a new method of measuring which TV shows are watched by 
Latinos. The goal is to have a Latino ratings service everyone accepts. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, in turn, sought help on the $38-million project from Research 
Resources, a little-known 9-year-old Agoura Hills firm that specializes in 
measuring Latino consumer tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Research Resources has surveyed Latino reaction to various cars, drinks, foods, 
movies and home-care products for clients such as Eastman Kodak, Warner-Lambert 
and Kimberly-Clark, although its research director and vice president, Carlos 
E. Garcia, declined to identify which products were surveyed for which company. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the Nielsen project underlines how the Latino population -- which 
has grown four times faster than the overall population since 1980 -- can no 
longer be ignored when it comes to marketing. Previously, a lot of advertisers 
and their agencies were "not willing to staff for it, they're not willing to 
budget for it," Garcia said. Now, "they can't say, 'Well, it's not worth it.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Project 
</P>
<P>
Garcia would not divulge how much of the money Research Resources will collect 
from the Nielsen project. Ceril Shagrin, a senior vice president at Nielsen, 
said the amount would be less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also declined to disclose the firm's annual revenue, except to say "it's 
well into the seven figures" and growing about 10% a year. But he acknowledged 
that the Nielsen deal "is likely to become our biggest project to date." 
</P>
<P>
The project will start next month with a pilot program in Southern California, 
chosen because Latinos account for about 30% of the area's population. Research 
Resources' role will be to set up the pilot program with 200 households that 
make up a representative sample of Latino TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, whose well-known TV ratings survey samples 4,000 households 
nationwide, hopes next year to sample 800 Latino households across the nation 
to create a new, separate Latino ratings service. But it's undecided whether it 
will use Research Resources to help with that project as well, Shagrin said. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Nielsen, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., pick Garcia's firm to 
help at all? "We started asking people" in the research community, "and the 
name Research Resources came up," said Edward Schillmoeller, a Nielsen senior 
vice president for statistical research. "We didn't come across too many other 
organizations, at least in the Los Angeles area, that specialized in this kind 
of work and that we felt did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Talents Cited 
</P>
<P>
Research Resources was started in 1980 by Dale Dauten and Theresa Menendez, who 
had worked for Hollander &amp; Associates, a research firm in Atlanta. By 1988, 
however, Menendez moved to Miami to start her own firm, and Dauten sold most of 
Research Resources to his employees for an undisclosed amount. He retains a 
minority interest and continues as a consultant. The firm is now majority-owned 
by its eight employees. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia joined the firm last year after spending more than six years at Market 
Development, a Latino research firm in San Diego. Garcia, 38, who grew up in 
East Los Angeles, learned several languages and earned a master's degree in 
comparative literature, then lived in France and taught French and English to 
French schoolchildren. He thought of becoming a college professor, but said it 
appeared to be a "career of poverty and intellectual fulfillment." So he took a 
job in market research. 
</P>
<P>
He said Research Resources' talent lies in its ability to understand and 
communicate clearly with the Latino community so that its surveys are as 
accurate as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The firm does both quantitative research, whereby it surveys hundreds or 
thousands of people with the same questions, and "focus groups," in which it 
gathers eight to 12 people to discuss a new product or service. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in trying to survey Latino reaction to a cold breakfast cereal, a 
focus-group talk likely would reveal that "Hispanics will eat breakfast cereals 
at night or for afternoon snacks for kids," whereas they prefer hot cereals for 
breakfast, Garcia said. A quantitative survey might never have picked up that 
fact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advertisers Dispute Figures 
</P>
<P>
In its Nielsen project, Research Resources will try to help settle the dispute 
over how many Latinos watch television. Ratings, of course, determine how much 
money the TV networks can charge advertisers for commercial spots. The Spanish 
networks currently get national Latino ratings numbers from only one source, a 
Miami-based firm named Strategy Research, Univision's Grimes said. Nielsen and 
another ratings firm, Arbitron, also measure Latino viewership in certain 
individual cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes said the dispute over Latino rates is this: Strategy Research has 
estimated that nationally about 70% of Latinos watch Spanish TV. Since Latinos 
make up about 10% of the population, that means about 7% of the overall 
population watches the Spanish networks. 
</P>
<P>
But advertisers find those figures too high, compared to the Nielsen and 
Arbitron ratings for certain cities, he said. In Los Angeles, for instance, 
Nielsen and Arbitron ratings show about 8% of all the viewers watch Spanish TV 
-- nearly the same as Strategy Research's national ratings. But the Latino 
population in Los Angeles is three times the national level, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers therefore conclude that Strategy Research "is greatly overstating 
Hispanic viewership," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish networks, meanwhile, have questioned whether the Nielsen and 
Arbitron figures understate Latino viewership. Grimes said other surveys have 
shown that, indeed, more than 70% of Latinos watch Spanish TV. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Measure Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
The networks "had a good argument because Nielsen and Arbitron weren't really 
making a big special effort to reach Hispanics," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
The result: "There was not an accepted benchmark for dealing with Hispanic 
audiences, and without that, the Hispanic TV stations felt they were not 
getting their share of the advertising based on the Hispanic penetration in the 
United States," Nielsen's Shagrin said. 
</P>
<P>
Strategy Research President Richard W. Tobin agreed that his firm's ratings 
tend to show more Latino viewers than Nielsen and Arbitron, but said that's 
because his firm samples a larger number of Latinos. He said he welcomed the 
new Nielsen project because it would validate his firm's readings. 
</P>
<P>
"We totally endorse the idea of a strong, accurate second measurement," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Such information is becoming more crucial to corporate advertising decisions 
because advertisers are increasingly anxious to tune in the Latino audience, 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Upper management is finally asking managers, 'Well, what are you doing about 
the Hispanic market?' " Garcia said. "And the feet aren't dragging anymore. 
People are realizing there's money to be made, that if they're not in that 
market, all of their competitors are going to be and they're going to be losing 
out."

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SHRINKS IN QUARTER AS EXPORTS RISE 
</P>

The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $27.7 billion from April through June, the 
best showing in more than four years, as a record level of exports overcame a 
big surge in America's foreign oil bill, the government reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the 2.3% drop in the trade deficit during the 
second quarter marked the second consecutive quarterly decline. The deficit had 
fallen an even sharper 11.4% in the first three months of the year to $28.38 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The April-June improvement came from a 3.4% increase in exports, which climbed 
to an all-time high of $90.87 billion. This more than offset a 2% rise in 
imports, which also set a record at $118.58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Oil Demand 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are concerned that the rapid growth in exports, which provided 
much of the momentum for overall economic activity last year, has already begun 
to slow under the impact of a rise in the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
A stronger dollar makes American goods less competitive on overseas markets 
while making imports cheaper in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rising demand for imported oil is also expected to make the deficit worsen in 
the second half of the year. While non-oil imports actually fell in the second 
quarter, oil imports shot up by 23.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the end of the good news on trade," said Michael Evans, head of a 
Washington forecasting firm. He and other analysts predicted that the deficit 
would widen slightly in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down During Half 
</P>
<P>
"With the dollar having risen so much in the last 18 months, export growth has 
slowed while import growth remains fairly strong," said David Wyss, an 
economist with DRI-McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit is running at an annual 
rate of $112.2 billion, down almost 12% from the 1988 deficit of $127.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said he expected that the deficit would show only a marginal improvement 
for the whole year, and he predicted that the trade deficit would actually 
begin to rise again in 1990 as the dollar's increase eats further into export 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of payment 
basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the Commerce Department's 
monthly merchandise trade reports. 
</P>
<P>
The totals from the two reports vary slightly because the balance of payments 
report excludes military sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor 
adjustments to the monthly figures.

PAN AM SEEN INTERESTED IN CONTINENTAL;

AIRLINE JOINS OTHER POSSIBLE BUYERS INCLUDING SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES

Pan Am Corp. is among those interested in the possibility of buying Continental 
Airlines from Texas Air Corp., a source close to Pan Am said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said at the company's annual meeting last week 
that all or part of Houston-based Continental was on the block. Then it was 
reported over the weekend that Scandinavian Airline System and an unidentified 
partner are preparing a bid for Continental. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Lorenzo said the fallout from the bankruptcy of Eastern 
Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary, had hurt Continental's business. 
</P>
<P>
Half of SAS is owned jointly by the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, 
with private investors holding the other half. SAS owns just under 10% of 
Continental and has a marketing arrangement with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged Financing 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, parent of Pan American World Airways, has vast overseas operations, 
especially in the transatlantic market, and is known to be hoping to merge with 
an American carrier that has a domestic route system capable of feeding 
passengers to Pan Am's overseas flights. Airline observers maintain that Pan 
Am, which has been losing money, cannot survive without such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
These observers say Continental seems to fit the bill. This summer, Pan Am lost 
out in the bidding war for NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, and recently 
was reported to be interested in bidding for UAL Inc., which owns United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Pan Am could be considered a potential buyer, a possible suitor, for 
Continental," the source said. "Pan Am has proved that it can pull the 
financing together to swing the deal," the source said. Pan Am was understood 
to have arranged at least $3 billion worth of financing to support its bid for 
NWA. 
</P>
<P>
At Pan Am headquarters in New York, spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler declined to 
discuss any role that Pan Am might have in a purchase of Continental. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was also learned that Drexel Burnham Lambert, Continental's 
investment banker, had approached Pan Am about three weeks ago to see if would 
have any interest in buying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases Most Planes 
</P>
<P>
For the Northwest purchase, Pan Am had lined up financing with Prudential 
Bache, the Airlie Group investment partnership, the Lazard Freres investment 
firm and a consortium of five major banks. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analysts contend, however, that even though Pan Am might have obtained 
enough financing for an acquisition of NWA or UAL, it would be much more 
difficult to do so for an attempt to buy Continental. The analysts reason that 
Continental owns a far smaller proportion of its airliners and other assets 
than the other two carriers do, so Pan Am would need considerably more cash to 
finance the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Avmark Inc., an aviation marketing and management service in 
Arlington, Va., the most recent figures show that Continental owns only about 
33% of its 339 planes and leases the remainder. Northwest, on the other hand 
owns all but 12% of its 306 planes. United owns all but 14% of its 425 planes. 
</P>
<P>
"When so many planes are leased, the assets against which you can borrow are 
much smaller," said Paul Turk, an Avmark official. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts also maintain that Texas Air's asking price for Continental will 
be too high for Pan Am. "Lorenzo does not sell things cheaply," said one 
analyst who insisted on anonymity.

EXPERTS SPLIT ON WHICH DIRECTION COMPUTER RESEARCH SHOULD GO

The mere thought of it must be sheer heresy to the likes of corporate titans, 
but the plain fact is there are computer scientists out there who just don't 
care about quarterly sales, market shares and profits. 
</P>
<P>
And a good number of these fellows -- yes, they are mostly men -- have gathered 
here this week from around the world to ponder and discuss the outlook for 
computer science some five to 20 years into the future from their perspectives 
in the research and development laboratories of today. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the highbrow conversations and detailed scholarly papers here at the 
World Computer Congress, the nearly 1,400 "nerds on the cutting edge," as one 
local wag dubbed them, are being exhorted to expand their software engineering 
and programming language horizons to include more of the present-day realities 
of corporate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bottom Line Results 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists are increasingly being asked to get out of their ivory towers, and 
many of those who do leave are doing quite well for themselves in the world of 
business," explained Herve Gallaire, managing director of the European Computer 
Industry Research Center. "After all, there's no way you can continue to pursue 
theory without drying out." 
</P>
<P>
The strong undercurrent toward practical science at the prestigious triennial 
congress revives the age-old tug-of-war between applied and theoretical 
research at a time when funding for scientific research is increasingly being 
dictated by the requirements of such mundane matters as bottom line results. 
</P>
<P>
For example, John Young, president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, the 
Silicon Valley computer maker, told the congress that nearly half the $125 
billion spent annually in the United States on scientific research comes from 
private enterprise, whose ability to fund these projects is increasingly 
pinched. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been noticed by the scientists, and many are clearly not happy 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Knuth, a computer science professor at Stanford University, decried the 
situation during a welcoming speech to the congress, and argued that funding 
for theoretical and practical research must be more balanced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Priorities 
</P>
<P>
"The scientific community faces a crisis in which a substantial number of the 
world's best scientists in all fields cannot get financial support for their 
work unless they subscribe to somebody else's agenda," Knuth said. "We need to 
go back to a system where people . . . are given a chance to set their own 
priorities. . . . Otherwise we'll face a big slump in our future abilities to 
tackle new problems." 
</P>
<P>
Even those who are benefiting from the trend aren't necessarily completely 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Kurt Kosanke, a German computer scientist at the Brussels 
laboratories of Esprit, a research consortium of several dozen European 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Kosanke has headed a research team of nearly 60 
engineers who are exploring ways to improve the use of computers and 
computer-generated information in the basic process of manufacturing, whether 
automobiles or steel. 
</P>
<P>
Although his project is viewed as a practical solution to real-life problems,

T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.94%, down from 7.99% last week. Another $7.2 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.88%, 
up from 7.85% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 8.21% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,799.30 and 8.32% for a six-month bill selling for $9,601.60. The discount 
rate reflects the price discount received when they are purchased at less than 
face value. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve reported that the average 
yield for one-year T-bills, the most popular index for making changes in 
adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 8.36% last week, up from 8.30% the previous 
week.

Pan Am Reaches Preliminary Settlement: Pan American World Airways and 115 women 
flight attendants fired for being overweight have agreed to a preliminary 
$2.35-million settlement. The flight attendants claimed that Pan Am's pre-1988 
weight standards were tougher on women than on men. While not eliminating 
weight restrictions, the new rules permit women to be measured by the same 
"large frame" standard as men, and allow women to add an additional three 
pounds when they reach ages 35, 45 and 55.

UAW Ratifies Chrysler-Mitsubishi Contract: The United Auto Workers ratified a 
three-year contract with Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. 
and Mitsubishi. Exact vote totals were not released, but officials said the 
pact was approved Sunday by a margin of about 3-to-1. The agreement, worked out 
over five months of negotiations, covers 2,300 production and maintenance 
workers at the plant in Normal, Ill. The raises will bring salaries at the 
plant into line with wages of auto workers at other plants represented by the 
UAW. The $650-million Diamond-Star plant began production of the Plymouth Laser 
and Mitsubishi Eclipse about one year ago.

PURITAN-BENNETT BUYS 40% STAKE IN FOXS LABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puritan-Bennett Corp. said it has acquired Beta Sensor Partners' 40% interest 
in Foxs Labs Inc. of Carlsbad for $9.1 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Puritan-Bennett said since Foxs Labs reached advanced development of its 
invasive arterial blood gas technology for continuous patient monitoring 
earlier than expected, it plans to increase investment in research and 
development and manufacturing process development. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the additional interest expense and good will amortization 
costs from the acquisition along with the accelerated R&amp;D and manufacturing 
spending, will represent an extraordinary expenditure of about 34 cents per 
share spread during the last half of 1989 and all of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Puritan-Bennett said some of the investments, particularly in 1990 and beyond, 
can be funded from normal sales growth and R&amp;D spending. The company also 
decided to take an extraordinary gain of about 25 cents a share.

ALADDIN OWNER GINJI YASUDA FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda filed Monday to put the ailing Aladdin Hotel 
under federal bankruptcy protection, citing total debt that outstripped the 
resort's assets by more than $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a Nevada casino, reported 
in the Chapter 11 filing that his Ginji Corp. owed $121.2 million to various 
creditors while having total assets of $82.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing, which had been widely expected, comes on the heels of 
the Nevada Gaming Commission's decision last week to yank Yasuda's license and 
give the Aladdin until next Tuesday to comply with a list of conditions to 
allow its casino to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks This Week 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the bankruptcy filing has not changed 
the commission's insistence that the Aladdin hire several new officers, put a 
$3-million cash infusion into the casino and disclose the source of recent 
loans to the resort. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the primary focus or goal has really changed," O'Reilly said. "I 
would hope they bring forward information Tuesday that will show their 
compliance with the conditions and justifications for further licensing." 
</P>
<P>
James Shea, an attorney who worked on the petition, said the hotel has already 
begun to comply with the commission's conditions, including the hiring Monday 
of longtime gaming figure Robert Brooker to be general manager.

COMPAQ WILL CUT PRICE OF SOME DESKTOP COMPUTERS 
</P>

<P>
Bowing to competitive pressure, Compaq Computer Corp. said Monday that it is 
cutting the price of some of its high-end desktop models introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's decision follows similar price reductions by smaller, rival 
manufacturers and lower prices for computer memory chips, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston-based Compaq is one of the major makers of IBM-compatible computers. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq said it is cutting prices on its higher-end Deskpro 386/25 and its 
386/20e machines by 3.5% to 12.5% to maintain their competitive position 
against other 80386-based machines. 
</P>
<P>
The price reductions were the first for the Compaq product lines based on the 
80386 Intel Corp. microprocessor, one of the fastest processors in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just common sense -- they can't live in a vacuum," said Edmund Spelman, 
an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "It's obvious that there's a lot more 
competition in the 386 chip. I don't think it's a signal that they're seeing 
any hidden weakness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had a very unusual personal computer market, with strong DRAM 
(dynamic random access memory) prices, plus exuberant demand, plus conversion 
to 386 machines," said Nikko Securities International analyst Michael Geran. 
</P>
<P>
David Wu, an analyst at S. G. Warburg, Rowe &amp; Pitman, Akroyd Inc., said 
Compaq's price cuts on most machines were well within the expected yearly 
range, with only one, the Deskpro 386/20e, cut more than 12.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Several off-brand companies started the price moving downhill. When the price 
of materials goes down, Compaq usually takes prices down," Wu said. "Prices in 
the PC business go down every year." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said the new pricing will make the Compaq products more 
competitive.

SMALL CONTRACTORS OFTEN SPARED; 
</P>
<P>
SURVIVING THE DEFENSE BUDGET WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When deficit-conscious politicians start slashing the defense budget on Capitol 
Hill, military contractors often have sleepless nights. But not John Firth. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Firth, president of Eldyne Inc., a San Diego-based electronics 
contractor, knows his company recently secured five multiyear contracts from 
the Navy, worth nearly $50 million, to provide a variety of services, including 
engineering for an anti-submarine warfare combat system. 
</P>
<P>
Usually when spending is slashed, costly new military projects such as weapons 
systems or aircraft are the first to go, Firth said. As a result, major 
contractors associated with such projects can face an abrupt and severe loss of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spared the Ax 
</P>
<P>
But small contractors such as Eldyne that provide special technical services 
that have become indispensable to the military are often spared by the budget 
ax, he said. Eldyne is an example of how a military contractor can carve a 
niche in the market and remove itself from Capitol Hill's budget wars. 
</P>
<P>
Eldyne reported revenue of $18.5 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 
Firth said, and, for the fiscal year ending next July, it expects sales of $23 
million to $24 million. The company is profitable, Firth said. 
</P>
<P>
"When defense spending is flat, the people who get hurt are those connected to 
major programs. It's those big programs that get whacked off. Right now, for 
example, there's a lot of attention on the B-2 bomber program. If that were to 
be dropped, somebody like Northrop would be hurt pretty bad. 
</P>
<P>
"When programs get (completely axed), it doesn't hurt us at all," Firth said. 
"That's because we've focused on certain niches where we have the expertise to 
provide for an ongoing need. We're not (manufacturing) a fancy new toy. We 
might not make the megabucks, but we'll always get our $20 million or so." 
</P>
<P>
Eldyne, founded in 1979, employs more than 300 people and occupies a 
40,000-square-foot facility in Kearny Mesa that serves as corporate 
headquarters and engineering services department. The company also has a 
6,000-square-foot manufacturing plant nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also Maintaining a Niche 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, a San Diego military contractor that makes gyroscopes for guided 
missiles, is also maintaining its niche in the defense market, according to 
President Paul Humphrey. The company recorded $11.2 million in revenues for 
1988 and projects 1989 revenues to exceed $17 million, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
"When defense spending gets trimmed, it clearly affects the multibillion-dollar 
contractors, but it doesn't really bother us," Humphrey said. "We produce more 
consumable goods that are always in demand. Sure, a few missile systems get cut 
or aren't renewed, but there's always some other contract coming our way." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey manufactures its gyroscopes for both the United States and foreign 
militaries. For example, Humphrey is supplying Rockwell, which is manufacturing 
the Hellfire missile for the U.S. Army and the Swedish navy. Humphrey has 270 
employees based at its corporate headquarters and two manufacturing plants, all 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Eldyne designs and installs a variety of electronic systems, including 
communications, navigation, satellite communications, radar and sonar systems, 
for naval fleets and shore facilities, Firth said. The company specializes in 
establishing "electromagnetic compatibility" -- allowing several communications 
systems packed into close quarters, such as those in a submarine, to work 
together without being disrupted by each other's electrical signals. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have so many systems together, it's very easy for one system's 
signals to clutter or mask the signals of another," said Ron Lewis, Eldyne's 
business development manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Have Increased 
</P>
<P>
Eldyne's electronic design service accounts for 90% of the company's business, 
Lewis said. The company also makes communication antennas and antenna tilting 
mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was spun off from parent company Electro-Design, Eldyne has increased 
its sales by an annual rate of 35%, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Electro-Design was split doing two kinds of work," he said. "The owner of 
Electro-Design was more interested in doing hardware design and manufacturing 
his own products, rather than the engineering service that we were providing. 
That's why we decided to part and make each side a separate business." 
</P>
<P>
Under the newly won Navy contracts, the services to be provided by Eldyne will 
also include correcting electromagnetic interference on Navy ships and 
supplying the Navy with new communication antennas.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SIERRACIN CORP. SAYS PROFIT FELL 29% IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sierracin Corp. in Sylmar said its second-quarter profit fell 29% from a year 
earlier, to $370,000 from $521,000. 
</P>
<P>
The maker of cockpit windows and other aerospace products said its revenue was 
virtually flat: $20.4 million in the latest quarter, which ended June 30, 
compared with $20.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sierracin blamed the lower earnings on operating cost overruns, higher costs 
for materials, and greater provisions for excess and obsolete inventories. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, Sierracin's profit fell 11% to $845,000 from 
$951,000, and its revenue edged up to $40.9 million from $39.5 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: COM SYSTEMS SHOWS LOSS OF $2.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Com Systems, a Van Nuys-based long-distance telecommunications services firm, 
reported a loss of $2.9 million for the first quarter that ended June 30, 
contrasted with $807,000 in net income a year earlier. Revenue increased 44% to 
$20.2 million from $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Licklider, Com System's chief executive, blamed the loss on an increase in 
fraud in the firm's operator service business. The fraud involved people who 
obtained authorization codes to enter the company's system and dial 
international calls, Licklider said. The company has put mechanisms in place to 
reduce the amount of fraud, such as a new automated calling card validation 
system, he said. But he added that third-quarter results would also be 
negatively affected by fraudulent calls made before these mechanisms were 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Licklider also said large up-front costs associated with adding 14,000 public 
pay phones to its network contributed to the loss. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months that ended in June, Com Systems reported a net loss of $2.1 
million, contrasted with net income of $1.3 million in the first half of 1988. 
Revenue rose 50% to $39.8 million from $26.6 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TRANSAMERICA INSURANCE SHOWS 28% PROFIT GAIN

<P>
Transamerica Insurance Group in Woodland Hills said its profit for the 
second-quarter that ended June 30 climbed 28% from a year earlier, to $27.5 
million from $21.5 million. The gain came on a 3% increase in the company's 
revenue, to $465.4 million from $451.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica Insurance is a property-casualty insurance subsidiary of 
Transamerica Corp., a financial services giant based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica Insurance's earnings for the first half of 1989 fell 56%, to $39.2 
million from $89.2 million, but the year-earlier results included a $44-million 
gain from an accounting change. Its six-month revenue rose 5% to $931.5 million

VALLEY EARNINGS: OLSON INDUSTRIES LOSES $914,730 IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olson Industries, a Sherman Oaks plastics-packaging concern, reported a 
second-quarter loss of $914,730, compared with a loss of $1.04 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came despite an increase in sales in the quarter that ended June 30, 
to $17.9 million from $16 million. Olson, as it has in recent quarters, blamed 
the loss mostly on higher prices for resins, the main raw material used in its 
packaging goods. 
</P>
<P>
Olson's principal unit, Dolco Packaging Corp., is operating under Chapter 11 of 
the U. S. Bankruptcy Code, whereby it is protected from creditors' lawsuits 
while working out a plan to restructure its finances. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, Olson lost $1.58 million, compared with a loss of 
$1.46 million a year earlier. Six-month sales rose to $37 million from $33.6 
million.

MURAL TO TRAINMAN IS A LITTLE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

<P>
When one of the largest, most colorful pieces of public art ever commissioned 
in the city makes its official debut Wednesday, viewers may have trouble 
finding it. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-foot-long, 40-foot-high mural, titled "Train of Wisdom," is hidden on 
the back side of Mission Federal Credit Union, at Park and El Cajon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its grand proportions, the mural's brilliant colors and powerful, 
futuristic images of children floating along on a surreal train pumping clouds 
of bright purple steam can be seen only if you happen to wander around the 
building's corner. 
</P>
<P>
That fact does little to diminish the excitement of San Diego muralist Mario 
Torero for the project he designed and executed this summer with the help of 12 
art students from city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another building like all the other hundreds of buildings we see 
every day," said Torero, 42, widely known for his murals in Chicano Park. "Now 
people are noticing this wall because of the art that is on it." 
</P>
<P>
The mural is the final phase of a project honoring a San Diego institution by 
the name of Frank the Trainman. For 40 years, Frank Cox sold and repaired model 
trains out of a grubby little store in the building. Ten years ago, he passed 
his business on to friend and fellow train buff Jim Cooley. When Cooley sold 
the property to Mission Federal Credit Union in 1987, he asked the new owners 
to create a monument to Frank the Trainman, who died early this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different, All Right 
</P>
<P>
Cooley, a self-acknowledged old-timer, hems and haws when asked what he thinks 
of Torero's unorthodox artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not of this modern generation, so it's a little hard for me to 
identify with it," Cooley said. "But, from what I understand, it's well done. 
It's different, I'll say that. It's a form of art that I don't understand, but 
that doesn't mean it's not good." 
</P>
<P>
To complete the memorial, $20,000 worth of Cox's antique model trains have been 
mounted in the branch office of the credit union, and an animated neon sign 
that once beckoned customers to the shop was refurbished and remounted outside. 
The 
</P>
<P>
architectural firm of Bradshaw &amp; Bundy reshaped the building's stucco 
exterior into the stylistic outline of a locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
The back wall of the building was left windowless to create a smooth space for 
a huge mural, the final phase of the project, which was requested by Cox before 
he agreed to sell the property about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When Torero was selected to paint the mural, he had no idea the building was 
shaped like a train. He visited the site, drew renderings of its big, blank 
wall, and took them to art students -- at O'Farrell High School of Performing 
Arts and Roosevelt Junior High School -- who had been assigned to help create 
the mural. 
</P>
<P>
The students drew pyramids and children and sun rays, all of which Torero 
incorporated into his final rendering. But one student outlined a train for the 
back of the building, and, when the other kids saw it, they loved the idea, 
with its big cow catcher of green and white stripes. Torero then realized that 
the building was conveniently shaped like a locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
The mural changed during the two months that Torero and his young staff worked 
on it. At one point, they realized it needed a stronger tie to San Diego, and 
they painted a vivid blue Coronado Bridge. The sun they had planned became a 
sunflower to incorporate nature into the mural, and the wheels of the train 
float through clouds to symbolize a journey of the imagination, Torero said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the mural is finished, the artist wants to make sure the community 
knows it's there. He hopes to create a small public park on adjoining land. The 
park could prove as surreal as the mural overlooking it. Torero wants to place 
two plastic cows near the street to catch the attention of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seats in a Station 
</P>
<P>
He's asked another artist to design colored cement benches, which he will 
arrange to look like seats in a train station. Torero hopes a walkway from the 
sidewalk along Park Boulevard that leads to the mural will draw passers-by. An 
abstract sign similar to 12 others designed by artist Robert Salas and 
installed along Park Boulevard near the zoo may also help point the way. 
</P>
<P>
Torero's plans require the approval of city school officials, who own the land 
next to the credit union. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, the enclave might become not only a monument to Frank the 
Trainman, but uptown's first and only train station. 
</P>
<P>
The mural will be dedicated at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at Mission Federal Credit 
Union, City Schools Branch, 4304 Park Blvd.

ARCHITECTURE: L.A. DESIGNER HITTING HIGH GEAR WITH MIX OF MODESTY AND MOXIE

Rebecca Binder launched her architectural practice 10 years ago with a rare 
boldness. Rather than wait for a client to come along with a first commission, 
as most hopeful young architects do, Binder became her own developer. With her 
husband, Gary Fisher, she purchased a site in Santa Monica and built a row of 
condominiums that immediately caught the attention of the design community and 
won a national award from the American Institute of Architects in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Condominiums, slotted onto a narrow lot near the beach, epitomize 
Binder's design signature. Compactly contrived, with every inch of the tight 
four-story units considered in detail, the condo townhouses draw upon the 
historical reference of Irving Gill's early modern Horatio West Court 
apartments while expressing their own 1980s high-tech individuality with 
brightly colored metal pipe rails and a cubist clarity of composition. 
</P>
<P>
Building on her 1985 national design award, her small but thriving Playa del 
Rey practice has produced an array of boldly conceived, scrupulously detailed 
designs that have won several hotly contested commissions for Southern 
California university projects. This fall Binder will be one of four young 
American architects chosen by the U.S. Information Agency for a display of 
avant-garde design in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent projects on the UC Irvine campus show Binder at her best. The 
Satellite Food Facility for the School of Social Science has the witty air of a 
small temple unearthed by archeologists. The fragmented geometry of the 
pavilions, with sharply conflicting angles and tilted roof planes, suggests a 
future history of the imagination that might transform the raw new campus 
conjured out of the semi-desert of the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Playful Design 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Engineering Research Facility is functionally a less playful 
design. The ERF building's workmanlike computer laboratories, classrooms and 
conference rooms are housed in gray stucco volumes that act as a sober foil for 
the design bravura of the neighboring complex designed by Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebecca has a distinctive design quality that doesn't dominate where it 
shouldn't, or fail to make a powerful statement where that is called for," said 
former UCI campus architect David Neuman, who commissioned both Binder campus 
projects. "She can be both modest and bold." 
</P>
<P>
Women designers are often accused by male colleagues of being too modest, too 
concerned for the welfare of the people who use the buildings they design, at 
the expense of making powerful formal statements. Male architects wonder -- in 
private and off the record -- if women have the moxie to make it as stars in a 
tough and competitive profession. "Reticence is a notorious female virtue," one 
male "starchitect" commented recently. 
</P>
<P>
Binder counters that she sees no real conflict between an architecture that 
cares about the people that must live, work and play in its spaces, and one 
that makes a major design statement. "To pose those elements as an either-or 
choice is foolish," she said forthrightly. 
</P>
<P>
Her clients agree. MCA executive Fred Bernstein, for whom Binder designed an 
expansion of his Sherman Oaks house in 1985, said that she "managed the subtle 
task of fusing our needs with her own concepts, without compromising either. 
More than that, she showed us how we could get what we wanted out of a tight 
little lot we thought would constrict our ambitions. Rebecca is bright about a 
lot of things, apart from architecture." Bernstein was so impressed with 
Binder's professionalism he has commissioned her to design a new more elaborate 
house on a much larger lot. 
</P>
<P>
An intense talker with bright brown eyes and a mop of dark black hair, the 
38-year-old Binder looks as bold as her architecture. She manages her 10-person 
office with a brisk yet easy assurance that allows her time with her 3-year-old 
son, Max. 
</P>
<P>
Binder says she always knew she wanted to be an architect. As a child she drew 
and painted obsessively. "By age 14," she said, " I was certain architecture 
was my preference." Yet she got her undergraduate degree from the University of 
Pennsylvania in English literature, "for reasons I can't quite recall." In Los 
Angeles she followed her true metier, graduating with a master's in 
architecture from UCLA in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Binder's particular balance between boldness and care for detail is best 
illustrated in the tiny Eats restaurant in El Segundo, completed in 1985. In a 
cramped space barely 12 feet wide and 60 feet deep, she created a chic little 
cafe by a skillful manipulation of free-form lighting troughs and angled planes 
that make the eatery seem ample. The brightly lit, gaily colored Eats grabs 
attention by sheer force of personality. 
</P>
<P>
This year Binder's career has entered high gear. Apart from the projects at UC 
Irvine, she has won commissions for the expansion of UCLA's Ackerman Student 
Union on Bruin Plaza and for the proposed Visual Arts Facility at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Binder triumphed over competition from several architectural 
heavyweights, including Rob Quigley and Barton Myers. Members of the UCSD 
selection committee reportedly chose Binder for her intensity and intelligence, 
plus the fact that a small firm would give particular personal attention to the 
high-profile project. 
</P>
<P>
"The recipe for successful architecture requires total dedication, social 
skills and a large dash of chutzpah," Binder said, "plus something else -- that 
mysterious ingredient called talent, that gives your designs a powerful flavor 
without killing a client's appetite. It's a subtle mixture that takes a lot of 
careful cooking."

GERMANI TROUPE HAS A WAY TO GO 
</P>

<P>
Since Al Germani began creating dances one year ago, the fledgling 
choreographer has accumulated a sum total of seven pieces -- two of which are 
still considered works-in-progress. Last weekend, Germani packaged them all for 
public display at City College. 
</P>
<P>
Germani was not on stage when the six-member troupe that bears his name 
performed its first major concert, but his presence was felt in almost every 
other way. The artistic director was credited in the program for sound track 
arrangement and costume concept, as well as all the choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Germani is ready to declare the company professional. The dancers and 
their head honcho are too short on experience and know-how to aspire to those 
heights. And there were no telltale signs of a bright future in this 
seven-piece potpourri. But Al Germani Dance Company showed plenty of 
determination as it gave its all at Friday's opening performance, and the 
audience was more than ready to meet it halfway. 
</P>
<P>
Germani's choreography mixed modern movement, ballet and jazz jargon without 
stretching the limits of any single element or breaking new ground with the 
hybrid form. Emotion, not motion, is the driving force behind his expressionist 
style, and almost all of his work relied heavily on dark psychological themes. 
In fact, for one group piece -- the introduction to a work-in-progress -- the 
choreographer kept his dancers in a stationary position throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many of the dances were allowed to wallow in the murky excesses 
of melodrama, aided and abetted by program notes that proclaimed them to be "a 
reflective statement mirroring that which lies within us," or "a frustrative 
attempt to impact our own inherent oppressiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Like all too many novice choreographers, Germani seemed unable to resist the 
temptation to explain obvious symbols and to hammer home his points with 
endless repetitions of overworked images. 
</P>
<P>
For "Chairworks," the program notes reminded us that the chairs were a 
"metaphor for that which holds us back." Then Germani proceeded to take his 
chair-borne dancers through their paces with numbing predictability. A little 
lighter touch would serve him and the dancers (who threw themselves into its 
taxing demands with a passion), a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
With no male dancers to work with, the messages about relationships are 
obviously skewed, but that didn't stop Germani. In "Opp," a series of dramatic 
encounters and desperate solos, he dressed half of the troupe's women in shirts 
and ties to set up his battle of the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Germani set this opus on oppression against a hodgepodge of gun blasts, 
drumbeats and other jarring sound patterns, but the dance never came together 
as an organic whole. The lighting design (which Germani obviously had a hand in 
as well), was another example of theatrical overkill. 
</P>
<P>
In "Pas de Blues," a work that is still evolving, he paired Tina Buerkle and 
Marni Respicio, then let each take the limelight for a solo section. This piece 
showed more potential, and the dancers -- decked out in leather jackets and 
rumpled jeans -- were at their best in its gritty designs. 
</P>
<P>
"Soma" (shown in an unfinished state at last summer's Dance X-Change concert), 
was included on this program, its focus expanded to four dancers. Buerkle was 
enigmatic as the ballerina, and she had competent support from the shadowy 
figures around her. But subtlety was not Germani's strong suit here either. 
</P>
<P>
Although the choreographer calls "Flop" "a glimpse of an escape to artistry," 
there was little real artistry or musicality in what was seen on Friday's 
program. And its fast-paced dance patterns called attention to the technical 
deficiencies in the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz-based "Tux" (with spoken text by Germani), put the whole cast in black 
bowler hats and set them against a red-lit backdrop for an Alwin Nikolais-style 
theater piece. It had its moments, but still needs work to keep it from 
fragmenting. 
</P>
<P>
The concert sagged badly under the weight of extensive pauses as the small band 
of dancers made hurried costume changes, since almost every piece on the 
program called for four or more performers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, with more experience, Germani will find his choreographic stride. He 
has only just begun to approach dance from the vantage point of a designer. But 
for now, his work looks derivative, redundant, and often self-indulgent.

ARTISTS HAVE 'NO STOMACH' FOR CENSORSHIP

No government can call artistic excellence into existence. . . . Nor should any 
government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his goals in 
his own way. Freedom is an essential condition for the artist, and in 
proportion, if freedom is diminished, so is the prospect of artistic 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Lyndon B. Johnson, upon signing the National Endowment for the 
Arts legislation into law, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson, meet Jesse Helms, devil's advocate to your plan for a 
politically unencumbered federal arts agency. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative senator from North Carolina called the National Endowment for 
the Arts to task last month for exercising the very freedom it was mandated to 
provide. Outraged by the endowment's partial support of two exhibitions that 
included photographs exploring sexual and religious themes, Helms proposed an 
amendment to prohibit the NEA from allocating any funds to promote art deemed 
obscene, indecent or denigrating to any person or class of people. The Senate 
approved the amendment by voice vote July 26, and the issue -- as well as 
proposed funding cuts of the NEA budget -- will be taken up by a House-Senate 
Conference Committee after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, public debate over Helms' measures has been confined to a verbal 
battleground, with editorials, petitions and letters flooding the media. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings, photographs and sculptures will no longer play the role of silent 
victim, however, when the "No Stomach" show opens Friday at downtown's 
Installation gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hearing a lot about what politicians have to say, but we're the ones 
making the work," participating artist Elizabeth Sisco said. "I think it's 
important that we express our voice." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 artists from San Diego, Tijuana and Los Angeles have been invited 
to submit work that addresses the issues of censorship and expressive freedom 
raised by the current NEA controversy. Encouraged to create new works "that 
test either societal or personal taboos," about half of the artists produced 
work especially for the show, according to local artist Gary Ghirardi, who 
organized "No Stomach" with fellow artists Lynn Engstrom and Graciela Ovejero. 
</P>
<P>
Ghirardi sees the show as "a maturity act, an act of solidarity among local 
artists," but perceptions of the show's purpose vary greatly among those 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a surge of adrenaline," artist Cora Boyd said. "It's a way to vent our 
anger." 
</P>
<P>
Engstrom stressed the educational importance of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as just a protest. I see it as bringing the problem to the 
public. Many of the works are informative or visual puns on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
One of the show's messages, she said, is that art can deal with difficult 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
By providing a forum for local artists to deal with sensitive subjects, the 
show also promises to open a Pandora's box of San Diego's stickiest issues. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fried's contribution to "No Stomach" confronts the "latent racism that 
exists in San Diego." On the opening day of the show, he will file a ballot 
initiative to name the city's new convention center the "San Diego White 
People's Convention Center." This, he said, will "fulfill the unwritten, 
unstated agenda of the Port Commission" in their refusal to name the center 
after slain civil rights activist the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect the initiative to actually pass," Fried said. "The purpose is 
to engage the community in dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The promotional flier for the show features a photo collage by Steven Criqui, 
showing San Diego on a state map, covered by a TV dinner and surrounded by 
Faberge eggs -- a comment on the upcoming Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
The collaborative work of David Avalos, Louis Hock, Elizabeth Sisco and Deborah 
Small has always dealt with "questions of censorship, efforts at control by 
politicians and questions of community values," according to Avalos. 
</P>
<P>
Added Sisco: "As artists in the community who have been censored, it is 
imperative that we participate in the show. We want to give people something to 
take away with them for further discussion in private realms about censorship 
in San Diego, and how the mayor's approach to art-making has made art a matter 
of political action and control." 
</P>
<P>
The four artists produced a billboard earlier this year that mocked the city's 
attitude of boosterism and obliquely criticized its exploitation of 
undocumented workers and its failure to name the new convention center after 
King. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard was funded by a grant from Installation gallery. Angered by the 
billboard's message, the City Council this summer voted to deny Installation 
any Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) funds, bypassing the City Commission for Arts 
and Culture's recommendation to grant the alternative space $42,000. In part 
because of community pressure, the City Council restored most of Installation's 
funds but put restrictions on their use. 
</P>
<P>
This recent episode mirrors, in miniature, the ex post facto censorship and 
deviation from the peer review panel process that Helms threatens to inflict on 
the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that, locally, Helms' agenda is already being practiced," Sisco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The much-beleaguered themes of sexuality, religious belief and patriotism will 
recur with insistence here as proof that such subjects are legitimate turf for 
artists. Raul Guerrero, whose work will contain the image of an American flag, 
defended the use of such recognizable symbols in art. 
</P>
<P>
"The show has to do with the freedom to use symbols that exist in the 
environment," he said. "We use these symbols to interpret ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism also will be focused on the subtler forms of censorship that exist 
within the art world itself. Nancy Barton will address the exclusion of women 
and minorities from the art world in a text to accompany the work of three such 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Honda's work will deal with the hostility of the art market toward 
work that is considered less than commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
Though "No Stomach" attempts to be little more than a symbolic gesture, 
Installation's sponsoring of the show is an active defiance of the City 
Council's efforts to stifle its expressive freedom. Installation's board of 
directors, which is running the gallery without a paid staff, unanimously 
agreed to support the show, according to board member Sandra Koteen. 
</P>
<P>
"Installation is the perfect vehicle for this kind of show," she said. "We had 
no hesitation about hosting it." 
</P>
<P>
Though the organization itself could not offer assistance beyond the use of its 
gallery space and nonprofit mailing privileges, several board members provided 
financial support for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the show will exorcise the spirit of censorship that haunts this 
gallery and the local art community or merely exercise it further remains to be 
seen. There's some whimsy in the "No Stomach" title of the show, Ghirardi 
admitted. "We are trying to get a reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Without any overriding curatorial vision, however, the show is a "wild card," 
artist Hock said. "Those people looking for a fight will probably find it 
there. Those who are looking to show that controversy is OK will have made 
their point. If the work is sufficiently transcendent, if it has some body and 
depth to it, people will see its merit." 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to irritate people, he said, "but it is hard to get them to 
understand what you're doing."

One Marine was killed and another was injured early this morning when the 
speeding car in which they were riding slammed into a parked car in San 
Clemente, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Lee E. Sears, a Marine based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, 
was traveling at 80 m.p.h. in the 3900 block of South El Camino Real at 1:10 
a.m. when he apparently lost control of the car and collided with a parked car 
and two palm trees, said San Clemente police dispatcher Pat Dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger, who was not identified until relatives could be notified, died 
at the scene, Dolphin said. Sears was taken to Mission Hospital and Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he remains in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Sears is being held on a charge of vehicular homicide, Dolphin said.

JUROR ENCOUNTER CAUSES FLAP IN HELMSLEY TAX TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
As the jury in the Leona Helmsley tax evasion trial began its fourth day of 
deliberations today, a flap arose over a report that one of the hotel queen's 
bodyguards was seen in an elevator with a juror. 
</P>
<P>
The report in the New York Post, quoting from the trial transcript, said U.S. 
District Judge John Walker had warned Helmsley "to tell her people to stay out 
of the hotel" -- not a Helmsley hotel -- where the jury sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, said today that he was assured the incident "was basically 
innocent." 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the incident occurred Friday night after the judge 
handed the case to the jury. The juror was accompanied by a U.S. marshal at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that at a hearing Saturday, the judge said, "If the Helmsley 
security people think they are doing their client a favor by investigating 
where the jurors are, the rooms the jurors are staying in, or what floor the 
jurors are staying in a particular hotel, they are not." 
</P>
<P>
This morning on entering the courtroom, Walker spotted the front page headlines 
in the newspaper that blared, "Angry Judge Warns Leona: Stay Away From Jury," 
and asked spectators to leave copies of the paper outside. 
</P>
<P>
Marshals then moved through the courtroom confiscating all newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction From Post 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed in the headline," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Commented Jerry Nachman, editor of the Post, "We don't rule on what's relevant 
in a trial, so we don't think it is in the province of the judge to decide 
what's newsworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't conduct trials in secret in this country."

The United States recalled its ambassador from Bulgaria today to underline its 
serious concern over the continuing abuse of the human rights of Bulgarian 
ethnic Turks. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: "The State Department is 
recalling Ambassador Saul Polansky for consultations. . . . The ongoing abuse 
of human rights of ethnic Turks by the government of Bulgaria remains an issue 
of serious concern to the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. figures, 310,000 ethnic Turks -- about one-third of the 
community -- have fled to Turkey from Bulgaria to escape the repression. 
Boucher said the United States is considering forms of refugee aid to relieve 
the financial pressure on Turkey.

Four men have now been arrested in the incident, police said. Teresa Ponce, 53,

Police said Jose Villa, 21, and Noe Ortiz, 31, were arrested at 1 a.m. in their 
Huntington Park apartment and are being held without bail on suspicion of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the party at an apartment complex in the 2300 block of N. 
Ontario Avenue turned into a brawl and that three neighbors -- David Robles, 
25; Audiel Gonzalez, 21, and Mario Jovin, 23 -- were stabbed. Robles later died

SHELLING SETS TANKER AFIRE OFF LEBANON;

A tanker carrying fuel for Lebanon's besieged Christians was struck by Syrian 
shellfire today and set on fire as it tried to run a Syrian blockade under the 
cover of darkness, police reported. Seven crewmen were killed and two were 
missing and feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
The incident touched off a fierce five-hour artillery battle between the 
Syrians and the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun in and around divided 
Beirut. Police said three people were killed and 16 wounded in the barrage, 
which dwindled to intermittent mortar and machine-gun exchanges by 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
That raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted March 8 to at least 795 
people killed and 2,263 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Police said only two Lebanese among 11 crewmen aboard the tanker were rescued. 
One of the survivors, Hanna Saddiq, said the tanker was attacked with missiles 
by "a Syrian gunboat" enforcing the 5-month-old blockade off the Christian-held 
coast during the night. 
</P>
<P>
But a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations, 
said the ship was shelled by radar-controlled Syrian howitzers deployed along 
the seafront in Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian artillery batteries along West Beirut's seafront also fired on Aoun's 
positions and the shelling quickly spread to residential districts, police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hit Off Maameltein 
</P>
<P>
Police said the ship, identified only as the Sunshield, was hit at least once 
by radar-guided artillery about 7 miles off Maameltein, an area 11 miles north 
of this war-torn capital. 
</P>
<P>
"As the captain shouted from the deck, demanding that the engine be switched 
off, I found myself trapped inside a hell of fire," Paul Issa, one of the two 
survivors, told the Christian Voice of Free Lebanon in a bedside interview at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Issa said he sustained severe burns as he threw himself into the sea that was a 
mass of burning fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to swim for a while under the surface and I remained in the water for 
more than 30 minutes before an army gunboat picked me up," he said with a 
choking, somber voice. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said he had no information on the ship's tonnage, registry 
or owners. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Sunshield was carrying 550,000 gallons of gasoline 
purchased by the Christian government headed by Aoun, which is vying for power 
with a rival Syrian-backed Muslim Cabinet.

Corrections officials have given subway gunman Bernhard Goetz two extra weeks 
in jail for failing to return a disposable razor, a violation of jailhouse 
rules, according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said Goetz refused to return the razor because he wanted to have 
one that only he would use. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz, 41, has said he believed prison officials gave him used razors that may 
infect him with the deadly AIDS virus. Prison officials maintain that all 
inmates get a new razor blade each time they shave. 
</P>
<P>
Goetz was scheduled to be released Sept. 6, but now is slated to be freed Sept. 
20, the newspaper said.

Iran's Parliament today approved all 22 nominations to President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani's new Cabinet, the country's official news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, described the vote of 
confidence by the 270-member Majlis as "unprecedented" since some members of 
all previous Cabinet slates had been rejected in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came after Rafsanjani got a last-minute boost for his proposed Cabinet 
today from radical Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi. 
</P>
<P>
"I see Mr. Rafsanjani's Cabinet as a successful one and one that supports the 
deprived . . . and whose members have worked hard for the revolution," Karrubi 
was quoted as saying by IRNA.

in his garage, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Boatman, 59, was found Monday lying in a pool of blood in the garage of his

pulled out a drawer too far and it fell. The gun was in the drawer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides directing "Hee Haw," Boatman worked as lighting consultant for 
Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.

A woman was sentenced to life in prison today for giving her daughter to a 
rapist in exchange for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James J. Rashid told Susan Barbier, 29, that 
she had "sunk to an intolerable level of humanity" in the May, 1988, incident, 
for which she was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid exceeded the sentencing guidelines, which called for 10 to 25 years in 
prison, saying Barbier has "very little, if any at all, potential for 
reformation." 
</P>
<P>
Barbier gave her 13-year-old daughter over to Anthony Sawyer, who raped the 
girl, then left the child alone while she went to get high with Sawyer, police 
and court records showed. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, who had two previous rape convictions, was sentenced last week to 40 to 
60 years in prison for raping Barbier's daughter.

Foreign tourism to China plummeted in July to nearly half the level of July, 
1988, but made a modest recovery from June following the bloody crackdown on 
the democracy movement, a report in the official English-language China Daily 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The country earned $2.2 billion last year from tourism, but analysts expect the 
industry will finish this year earning only half that figure. The peak summer 
season has been largely written off. 
</P>
<P>
Major hotels are operating at or below 50% occupancy, with some as low as 20%. 
The National Tourism Administration said only 80,000 foreign nationals entered 
the country in July, a 47.5% drop from July, 1988, but a modest 11.3% increase 
over June, the newspaper reported.

U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists have developed an infrared device 
that takes the guesswork out of buying watermelons, cantaloupes and honeydews. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of research, Gerald Dull, a USDA chemist in Athens, has unveiled 
a meter that measures the sugar content of individual melons. "The No. 1 
parameter of quality is sweetness," Dull said in a recent interview. "If you 
haven't got sweetness, you haven't got a good melon." 
</P>
<P>
The melon meter shines infrared light into the top of the fruit and then 
measures the amount of light that comes out the side. The computerized device 
determines the amount of soluble solids, based on the amount of light that is 
absorbed by the fruit. Dull said soluble solids are predominantly sugars. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies have already expressed an interest in producing melon meters, 
Dull said, and they probably will be installed initially in packing sheds, 
where the fruit is graded, packed and shipped.

MGM shareholders are to vote Sept. 23 on the $600-million planned sale of

The company had indicated previously that it would hang onto its TV operations, 
which include rights to 1,700 hours of programming including "Fame," "Sea 
Hunt," "Bat Masterson," "Highway Patrol" and "The Patty Duke Show."

In an attempt to get an edge in a highly competitive market, two manufacturers 
are coming out with car batteries they say will make jumper cables obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts, however, are uncertain whether the general public will 
be willing to invest in the costlier product. 
</P>
<P>
First to hit the market will be GNB Inc.'s Champion Switch battery with an 
initial run of 500,000 going on sale in the Southeast in October. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson Controls Inc., the nation's top auto battery maker, will bring out its 
EverStart in early spring. 
</P>
<P>
The technology is different, but both batteries have a reserve store of energy 
that cannot run down or be tapped unless a switch is thrown under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested retail price for EverStart will be $129.95 while Champion Switch 
carries the recommended price of $109.99. The usual range for car batteries is 
$60 to $80.
