ABORTION PROTESTERS FINED, HELD IN CONTEMPT BY JUDGE 
</P>

<P>
Likening them to "used car salesmen" who fail to deliver on their promises, a 
federal judge in Los Angeles found the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and 
12 activists in contempt Tuesday for defying court injunctions when they 
blockaded medical clinics in seven California cities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ordered the defendants to pay $110,000 
in attorney fees to the American Civil Liberties Union and other attorneys for 
costs they incurred in bringing the contempt action on behalf of such groups as 
the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima also levied $10,000 in fines against each of the individual defendants 
but suspended the penalties, saying the fines would be reimposed if the 
protesters again violated court orders preventing the blockade of clinics where 
abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the activists were cited for violating the injunction in connection 
with demonstrations March 18 and April 8 at San Diego-area clinics. San Diego 
prosecutors have brought misdemeanor charges against three of those four in 
connection with those protests and another this spring. 
</P>
<P>
In unusually strong language, Tashima said it was "hypocritical" for Operation 
Rescue to engage in civil disobedience and then seek to avoid responsibility 
for its actions. To do so, he said, stripped the movement's acts of "any moral 
meaning." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's rather ironic for an organization like Operation Rescue to claim 
it's a civil disobedience movement and then to assert it can't be held liable 
for its actions," Tashima said from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of civil disobedience is to allow yourself to be punished . . . 
because you have allegiance to a higher authority," the judge said. "To deny 
responsibility, you become nothing more than ordinary lawbreakers. . . . It is 
simply hypocritical and nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
Tashima then added: "Some people who have been beguiled by Operation Rescue 
leaders should ask themselves why are they (the leaders) denying responsibility 
for what they've done. It's very much akin to a used car dealer -- what's 
advertised up front is not what they're willing to do when the chips are down." 
</P>
<P>
The judge seemed to be referring to statements made by Operation Rescue leaders 
that protesters would face little more than "a mild slap on the hand" for their 
protest activities. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hills, executive director of the ACLU's San Diego office, said she is not 
only "pleased" with Tashima's decision but "particularly pleased with some of 
(the judge's) comments in the courtroom. They were a real vindication for us." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors at the San Diego city attorney's office -- involved in criminal 
cases against three of the activists -- also said Tashima's ruling was a 
vindication. 
</P>
<P>
"The finding of contempt in the federal injunction vindicates our position," 
said James M. Bishop, head deputy city attorney. "We believe people have a 
lawful right to run a business without lawful interference. The expression of 
free speech does not include shutting down a lawful business merely because you 
disagree with the business." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at one of the businesses involved in bringing the suit, WomanCare 
Clinic in San Diego, said they felt not vindicated but "very victorious," said 
associate director Patricia O'Neil. She predicted the "hubris" of those 
affiliated with Operation Rescue "will be diminished" because of Tashima's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Tashima issued a statewide injunction to prevent massive 
anti-abortion demonstrations from blockading women's clinics throughout 
California. More than 1,000 protesters subsequently were arrested during the 
demonstrations at clinics in Los Angeles, Cypress, Long Beach, Escondido, 
Chico, Fresno and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU filed suit in April seeking to have Operation Rescue held in contempt 
for going through with the protests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
During a 12-day hearing, the ACLU presented numerous witnesses who testified 
about demonstrations that allegedly violated Tashima's statewide injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said they did not visit the clinics to obtain abortions but 
merely to receive medical attention for pregnancy problems. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, Denise Schofield, testified that she was prevented from keeping an 
appointment with a doctor outside a San Diego clinic where a protest was being 
held. Schofield added, however, that she was not planning to have an abortion 
and instead wanted to see a doctor because she feared that she was having a 
miscarriage or a dangerous tubal pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declined to award any damages to individuals or clinics where the 
demonstrations were held. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lenore Lowe, an official with Planned Parenthood in San Diego, said she 
was "delighted" with the decision and characterized Operation Rescue protesters 
as "no better than common criminals." 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Carol Sobel said she thought that Tashima's ruling would have a 
deterrent effect on anti-abortion protesters because they are now on notice 
that they could incur substantial financial penalties if they broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear signal that it will be expensive to continue this 
unacceptable, immoral conduct," Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defiant Reaction 
</P>
<P>
But Cyrus Zal, Operation Rescue's attorney, had a defiant reaction. He said 
Tashima's decision will be appealed and predicted that there would be further 
blockades of abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"People should not be punished for saving lives," Zal said. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Sullivan, San Diego spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said the ruling 
"will make no difference. We are committed and willing to sacrifice whatever it 
takes to save these babies." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the ruling will not deter further demonstrations. "We intend to 
rescue in September (in the San Diego area). That's correct." Operation Rescue 
takes the position that it is rescuing lives by blockading clinics where 
abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
At an earlier stage of this case, Tashima ruled that neither the group nor 
individuals could introduce evidence that they should be allowed to commit acts 
of trespass at the clinics under a defense of "necessity" of saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Zal reasserted that right and said, "It's sad that Judge Tashima has 
thrown in his lot with the persecutors of the unborn baby." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome of any appeals, Zal said Operation Rescue and the 
individuals who were found guilty of contempt would resist paying the money 
that they were ordered to pay Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anyone (involved with Operation Rescue) will ever pay a dollar 
that would go to the ACLU," Zal said, referring to the ACLU as "baby killers." 
</P>
<P>
He said that 26 million unborn children had been killed by abortion since 
abortion was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"This far surpasses any holocaust in human history," Zal asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prediction Made 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the ACLU and Tashima would ultimately be prosecuted for 
murder under the Nuremburg principles that were used to prosecute Nazis after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Zal, who carries a Bible with him, frequently compares the situation of unborn 
children who may be the subject of an abortion to various victims of World War 
II. In his closing argument in this case, he compared aborted babies to 
Japanese-Americans who were put in internment camps in this country during 
World War II, but he added, "at least the Japanese weren't executed." 
</P>
<P>
Tashima, 55, spent 3 1/2 years in a U.S. government relocation camp in Arizona 
from 1942 to 1945 with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Before issuing his ruling Tuesday, the judge said: "My opinion (on abortion), 
which I've never expressed publicly, is not important. My obligation is to 
enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
The four activists in the ruling with San Diego ties were: 
</P>
<P>
* William R. Lehman, 29, of Vista. Tashima ordered Lehman to pay $25,000 in 
fees, the largest single amount of any activist. 
</P>
<P>
The judge found that Lehman took part in six different protests around 
California, including the one March 18 in Escondido and April 8 in San Diego, 
said Betty Wheeler, legal director for the ACLU's San Diego office, who 
attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman pleaded no contest last Thursday in San Diego Municipal Court to a 
charge of violating the federal court injunction, Bishop said. In exchange, 
prosecutors agreed to drop other charges, including a misdemeanor conspiracy 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gale E. Kaneshiro sentenced Lehman to 90 days in jail but suspended the 
sentence on condition he perform 180 hours of community service and comply with 
the federal injunction, Bishop said. Lehman also received three years' 
probation, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
* Constance V. Youngkin, 41, of San Diego. All of the $12,000 that Tashima 
ordered her to pay will go to the San Diego ACLU, Wheeler said. Unlike Lehman, 
who traveled around California, Youngkin was involved only with the two San 
Diego-area protests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Youngkin currently is on trial in San Diego Municipal Court on various 
misdemeanor charges stemming from the April 8 protest and another one April 29, 
Bishop said. Charges include violating the federal court order, a misdemeanor 
conspiracy count and trespass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Joseph L. Foreman, 34, of Long Beach, Operation Rescue's national field 
director. Tashima ordered him to pay $19,000. Foreman was linked to the April 8 
San Diego protest, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman faces misdemeanor charges in San Diego Municipal Court in connection 
with the April 8 and April 29 demonstrations, Bishop said. His case is due to 
follow Youngkin's, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeff White, Operation Rescue's Northern California director. Tashima also 
ordered White to pay $19,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
White helped organize the March 18 Escondido demonstration, Wheeler said. White 
does not face criminal charges in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The other eight are: 
</P>
<P>
Ken Tanner, former Operation Rescue director in Southern California; Randy 
Adler, a group leader in Southern California; Lawrence Shrank, a leader of the 
group's "National Holy Week" activities in Southern California in March; Thomas 
Scanlan, a "core leader" in Sacramento; Peter Haasl, a San Joaquin Valley 
Operation Rescue organizer; Jeff Barnes and Paul McConnell, who participated in 
a Fresno blockade, and Thorne Renfro, who participated in a Chico blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending before Tashima is a broader case filed by the ACLU in March 
asserting that Operation Rescue has violated the civil rights of all women 
seeking medical treatment at family planning clinics in California.

There's nothing like $42 million to make a person forgetful. "Like everyone 
else, we'd mapped out what we'd do if we won," said William Madigan, winner of 
a $42-million lottery jackpot in Illinois. "But today I can't remember a single 
thing we talked about. My mind's a blank." Madigan, 50, and his wife, Kathleen, 
38, appeared at a Chicago news conference after claiming Illinois' biggest 
single-winner lottery jackpot from Saturday's drawing. The Madigans, who live 
in suburban Hometown, will receive 20 annual payments of $2.1 million. Madigan, 
a supervisor for a security company, plans to keep his job for now. Mrs. 
Madigan, a gift shop clerk, said she will quit. The Madigans' three children -- 
Jennifer, 13, Lori, 11, and Steven, 10 -- have very definite spending plans. 
"I'd like my own room." said Lori, who now shares a room with her sister. 
Jennifer said she would like to buy some new clothes. "I like clothes and boys, 
but I can't buy boys," she explained. And Steven said he would buy baseball 
cards.

 -- President Bush's daughter, Dorothy, has separated from her husband, William 
M. LeBlond, family friends said. Dorothy LeBlond, the only daughter of the 
President and his wife, Barbara, celebrated her 30th birthday Aug. 18 with her 
vacationing family at Kennebunkport, Me. Her husband did not attend. The 
LeBlonds have two children, Samuel, 5, and Nancy, 2. Mrs. LeBlond, who is 
called Doro by the Bush family, works for the Maine Tourist Bureau. Her 
estranged husband is in the construction business in Maine. "I cannot confirm 
it and I won't," said Anna Maria Perez, the First Lady's press secretary. "It's 
Doro's private life. I can't talk about it. It's Doro's business." The 
President and his wife also have four sons.

 -- The makers of the film "Heart of Dixie" had a little problem when they 
tried to spell out their gratitude to Mississippi's governor. The closing 
credits thank a variety of people for making the movie possible, but in 
thanking the Mississippi Film Commission, the closing credits list Gov. Ray 
"Maybus." Actually, the governor's name is Ray Mabus. "Heart of Dixie" was 
filmed largely around Oxford, Miss., and the antebellum mansions of Holly 
Springs. It opened last week around the country. SHIRLEY MARLOW

COUNCIL APPROVES 5-YEAR BAN ON DEMOLITION OF SKID ROW HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that advocates for the homeless hailed as a major boost for the 
city's destitute, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved 
a tough new five-year ban on the demolition of single-room-occupancy hotels on 
Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which Mayor Tom Bradley has said he will sign into law, allows 
such hotels in the downtown area to be torn down only if the owner constructs 
an equivalent number of equally affordable replacement units. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big moment in this town," said a beaming Alice Callaghan, founder of 
the Skid Row Housing Trust, after the council vote. "Eight thousand people 
living in (single-room-occupancy hotels) or on the street will now have 
protection for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"This will do more to stem the rise of homelessness than anything the city has 
done so far," added Callaghan, director of the Skid Row-based Las Familias del 
Pueblo social service agency. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed in its 12-0 vote to establish a moratorium of up to 
three years on the demolition of such hotels elsewhere in the city. This 
less-restrictive measure includes a similar room-for-room replacement housing 
provision. But it also allows a second exemption under which hotel owners can 
demolish their buildings if they opt to pay the city a $25,000-per-unit fee for 
the construction of replacement housing. 
</P>
<P>
The new moratoriums replace shorter interim measures in effect since mid-1987. 
At that time, Bradley proposed a one-year demolition ban as a stopgap to 
preserve the city's dwindling low-income housing stock, particularly in Skid 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
With increased commercial and industrial business in the downtown area, many 
single-room-occupancy hotel owners had begun to demolish their buildings, 
adding significantly to the problem of homelessness in the city's neighborhood 
of last resort. Bradley, in a letter to council members Tuesday, urged approval 
of the extended ban, terming such hotels "the oldest and one of the most 
valuable housing resources for our low-income tenants in the city." 
</P>
<P>
While officials say the hotels serve a valuable function, they are hardly 
viewed as a housing stock of choice. Some of the 75 downtown hotels are clean 
and quiet. But many others are infested with rodents, roaches and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Typical rooms, occupied by one or two people, are 10 feet by 12 to 14 feet, 
with a sink and bathing and toilet facilities down the hall. Owners of the 
rooms, which usually rent for between $200 and $300 a month, do not require 
security deposits or the last month's rent up front. Most of the tenants, who 
can rent by the week or the month, are on welfare, Social Security or pensions. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy moratorium will provide advocates for the homeless with additional 
time to persuade religious and social service agencies to purchase and fix up 
more Skid Row hotels in a 50-block area east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The Skid Row Housing Trust, dedicated to preserving the housing, has already 
set up a nonprofit organization to purchase and rehabilitate three of the 
hotels. In addition, the Community Redevelopment Agency has created a 
corporation that has purchased a dozen more area hotels for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Zeidman, director of the city's rent stabilization program, said the 
council's action will safeguard 273 buildings and 25,000 tenants citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the city has asked for replacement housing," Zeidman 
said. "It's a positive disincentive to demolition."

SUPERVISORS OK MAJOR EXPANSION OF DOWNTOWN JAIL OVER PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting to ease crowding at the nation's largest detention facility, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a 2,408-bed expansion 
of the downtown Men's Central Jail, increasing the capacity to 9,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The project was approved on a 3-1 vote over the protests of Asian and Latino 
residents who contend that the neighborhoods from Chinatown to East Los Angeles 
are already overloaded with existing and proposed jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a little too much for our area to take," said Vivian Bonzo, 
president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. Opponents of the expansion have 
vowed to challenge it in court. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which has been in the works since 1983, is the cornerstone of a 
$600-million expansion of Los Angeles County's eight-jail system. The system 
was built for 13,464 prisoners but held 22,500 Tuesday. At Central Jail, 
prisoners have been forced to sleep in hallways and even the jail chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Jail expansion calls for building a two-story "inmate reception 
center" flanked by two concrete towers -- seven and eight stories -- on what is 
now a parking lot across from the existing jail on Bauchet Street. A jail 
hospital will be housed in a five-story tower at the rear of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Central Jail expansion, the 2,064-bed North County 
Correctional Facility is scheduled to open in December in the Santa Clarita 
Valley, and a 1,000-bed jail is planned for Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block urged supervisors to act swiftly, noting that 145,000 
minor offenders have been released early from jail since June, 1988, because of 
a court order limiting the capacity to 22,000 prisoners. County lockups hold 
people awaiting trial or sentenced to one year or less behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Our deputies are frustrated that people are not serving time in jail," 
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds said. Misdemeanor offenders sentenced to less than 
37 days in jail do not serve jail time because of the crowding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose district includes the Central Jail, cast the lone 
vote against the expansion. He pointed out that the county has no way to fund 
operations of the jail without taking money away from health and welfare 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is lobbying for state legislation that would allow a public 
vote on raising the sales tax in Los Angeles County by half a cent to raise 
$400 million a year for jail operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is too massive for the community," Edelman protested. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum said to Edelman, "If this project were anywhere else 
in the county, you'd be one of the leading proponents. But that's politics." 
</P>
<P>
Then turning to opponents of the project, Schabarum, who represents the 1st 
District in the east San Gabriel Valley, asked: "How come I haven't heard you 
raise the cry about the fact that the 1st Supervisorial District is responsible 
for the vast majority of garbage dumps that serve the people of this county, 
including East Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum was joined by Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana in 
supporting the project. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn was absent. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of Asians and Latinos has fought the jail expansion, claiming that 
it would hurt business and jeopardize the safety of residents. 
</P>
<P>
During a 90-minute hearing, Sharon Lowe, co-chair of the Latino and Asian 
Coalition to Improve Our Neighborhoods, told supervisors that adding another 
jail facility to the downtown area "virtually sentences our communities to 
County Jail for life."

STUDENT WHO FLED CHINA WINS ASYLUM 
</P>

Shortly after being granted political asylum Tuesday, a jubilant Chen Yiwei 
stepped outside the Los Angeles Federal Building, looked up at the sky and took 
a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm free! I'm free!" Chen shouted in Mandarin, according to her attorney, 
Dorothy Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"She was absolutely joyous. It was a delight to see her smile," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Roy J. Daniel's decision to grant Chen political asylum ended 
more than two months of detention for the 22-year-old former student, who said 
she fled China after the Beijing crackdown in June. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who said she is wanted by Chinese authorities for participating in 
pro-democracy activities in Beijing's Tian An Men Square and in her hometown of 
Xiamen, was seized by U.S. immigration authorities June 24 when customs 
officials at Los Angeles International Airport detected the false passport she 
said was necessary for her escape. 
</P>
<P>
Her bid for political asylum had been delayed at least twice previously while 
immigration authorities investigated her application and waited for a letter 
from the U.S. State Department on whether Chen should be freed. 
</P>
<P>
During her incarceration at an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention 
center in Inglewood, Chen's plight attracted a flood of public support 
nationwide. Harper said so many concerned individuals -- including some from 
Texas, Rhode Island and Tennessee -- contacted her to offer their support that 
her answering machine ran out of tape and her office ran out of paper for the 
facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon, at the end of a three-day closed hearing, Chen looked 
nervous as Daniel read his opinion, said Peter Mok, a member of the Western 
American Assn. of Chinese Political Refugees who was helping to interpret in 
court Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the judge granted Chen political asylum, there was a delayed reaction as 
an interpreter relayed the good news. 
</P>
<P>
"Then she hugged her attorney and cried," Mok said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen then turned toward Daniel and bowed to the judge to thank him, Mok said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Very Tired 
</P>
<P>
The publicity-shy Chen declined to be interviewed at length or to be 
photographed after her release, saying that she was extremely tired. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the news, I was very happy," Chen said in Mandarin during a 
telephone interview from a friend's Rosemead home Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mok said supporters from the political refugees association were planning to 
treat her to a Chinese dinner on her first night of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Because for two months she hasn't had Chinese food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday evening, Harper, who has relied on an interpreter to communicate with 
her client, declined to detail how she successfully argued for political asylum 
for Chen. She said the long-awaited State Department letter did arrive, but she 
would not elaborate on any of the evidence or facts presented in court. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said that during the hearing, USC Prof. Stanley Rosen, a China scholar, 
testified about the political conditions in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Clients 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who said she is representing an unspecified number of other Chinese 
nationals in their applications for political asylum, said Chen is her only 
client to have fled China. The others are Chinese already living here, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Chinese nationals are known to be detained by immigration officials 
in Inglewood, but Ira Bank, an attorney who represents some of them, said they 
have asked that he not discuss their cases with the press. 
</P>
<P>
Harper does not believe Chen's case sets a legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Chen has no immediate plans other than to rest, Mok said. The political 
refugees association cannot assist her financially but will help her find a 
host family and aid her in anything else she decides to do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although fatigued, Chen is still ecstatic about her newly won freedom, Mok 
said. After the court hearing, "she didn't even want to go get her things from 
the detention center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't want to go back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she has never been this happy before," said Mok, who was among a 
group of volunteers who visited Chen once a week during her detention. "Freedom 
is very important."

PAYZANT TROUBLED BY TEST RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest results of standardized tests taken by all 5th-, 7th-, 9th- and 
11th-graders in San Diego city schools show a leveling off or slight decline 
from the gains in recent years -- a mixed picture that schools Supt. Tom 
Payzant on Tuesday called troubling. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, reading comprehension and vocabulary scores throughout the 
district declined in many cases despite a continued emphasis by top 
administrators on new curriculum and teaching methods to boost reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
The latest numbers are certain to attract the attention of the Board of 
Education, which is impatient for schools to begin showing reading 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Battery of Subtests 
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, or CTBS, is given annually in the four 
grades each spring. It consists of a battery of subtests that measure seven 
areas, and it reports out individual scores for students as well as totals for 
each school and district. The seven areas are reading vocabulary, reading 
comprehension, language expression, language mechanics, spelling, mathematics 
computation and mathematic concepts and applications. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested so much in a snapshot of achievement at any point than I am 
in looking at trends," Payzant told the annual start-of-the-school-year 
gathering of principals and other district administrators Tuesday. "And, while 
we have improved compared to the early 1980s, from a smaller, historical 
perspective, the declines from last year are troubling." 
</P>
<P>
Even more disturbing, Payzant said, is that there is "some evidence that the 
gap between Asians and whites, on the one hand, and between Hispanics and 
blacks on the other, is showing some signs of widening again" after years of 
special effort to address the performance disparity. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-grade dip in several subtest areas is bedeviling since it continues a 
trend of upper elementary declines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Payzant has long argued for a broader system of evaluating achievement 
beyond standardized tests, he warned his audience Tuesday that, "while the 
debate goes on over (reliance on standardized tests), they are going to be 
around for a while, and we need to take the results with seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
The CTBS, written by the McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., is meant to identify 
strengths and weaknesses by academic objectives that are thought to be standard 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The latest median scores for fifth graders show drops in vocabulary, in 
spelling and in language expression from 1988. Reading comprehension, language 
mechanics, math computation and math concepts were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
For seventh grade, there was a small improvement in spelling, while vocabulary, 
reading comprehension, language mechanics, language expression and math 
concepts were unchanged. Math concepts dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Among ninth-graders, there were slight drops in vocabulary, while all other 
categories remained the same or dropped slightly. 
</P>
<P>
For 11th grade, spelling, language mechanics, language expression and math 
computation dropped, while math concepts rose. Reading comprehension remained 
steady.

RANCH RESIDENTS WANT TO PAY FOR HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much is it worth to rid the roads of Rancho Santa Fe of their rumbling 
trucks and commuter cars? The answer is $24 million, and Ranch residents are 
ready to make a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of watching traffic along their eucalyptus-shaded streets grow 
from a trickle to a torrent, Rancho Santa Fe leaders have hatched a plan to 
build another east-west route, a detour to take the daily parade of cars off 
the narrow roads that wind through the affluent estate community and shunt 
traffic to the south and east. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bill Paul bought a home on Paseo Delicias in 1975, he asked about the 
chances of traffic clogging the neighborhood. No problem, assured the real 
estate salesman. Just look at county road plans, which show a wide new highway 
skirting the Rancho Santa Fe community to the south. 
</P>
<P>
That highway, SF 728, is still on the county road plans and, Paul admits, 
likely to remain a paper highway for at least 10 years, unless money is found 
to build it sooner. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just what Paul and other Ranch leaders plan to do: provide about 
$8.4 million in front money to buy the right-of-way, do the engineering and 
construct a highway that will lure North County commuters off Rancho Santa Fe 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computerized Estimate 
</P>
<P>
County computers estimate that better than 20,000 cross-county travelers use 
Ranch roads to wend their way between Interstate 5 on the coast and Interstate 
15 inland. If a bypass route were available, between 40% and 50% of those 
drivers would use it, the computers say. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't come through our community because they like our eucalyptus 
trees," Paul said. "They come through here because it is the only way to go." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Rancho Santa Fe residents have been completely reactive to the 
traffic problem, seeking to deter drivers with stop signs. They even 
considered, but rejected, a possible toll road through the posh community. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Paul said, "We are trying to solve the problem, not avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
Gail MacLeod, former Rancho Santa Fe Assn. administrator and now a consultant 
to the association on road planning, calls the plan to privately finance a 
bypass highway unique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time that we can find that one community has proposed to 
finance public improvements in another area, that private funds have been used 
to speed up a public project," she explained. "If it works here, I think that 
other communities will want to take a look at this as a way of solving some of 
their problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Create an Assessment District 
</P>
<P>
What Ranch leaders propose is creation of an assessment district under a law 
that's been on the books since 1913. Bonds would be issued and sold, property 
owners benefiting from the new road would be assessed to pay the interest on 
the bonds so that the principal could be used to build the new highway now. 
Eventually, the County of San Diego would pay off the assessment bonds with 
funds received from its share of the half-cent sales tax for transportation 
purposes and from contributions of developers who need the road for access to 
future projects. "It's more complicated than that, of course, and there are a 
lot of matters to be worked out before it becomes a reality," MacLeod said. 
"But it is a new concept of financing, of providing up-front money, of getting 
a road built in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Paul and a team of volunteers have spread the word among 
Ranch residents and the surrounding communities of Whispering Palms, Rancho Del 
Rio and Hacienda Santa Fe -- all of whom would benefit from less traffic along 
the current cross-county commuter route down Via de la Valle and Paseo Delicias 
to Del Dios Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's astounding and amazing," Paul said of the results. "There's hardly anyone 
who isn't in favor of it. When you think about it, that we are asking people to 
voluntarily tax themselves to pay for a public road, that's quite unusual." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizens in Favor of Tax 
</P>
<P>
Walt Ekard, manager of the Rancho Santa Fe Assn., the quasi-government of the 
unincorporated community, said a poll of citizens found only about 25 or 30 
opposed to the idea. Petitions favoring the assessment have been signed by more 
than 1,000 people, he added. 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that "we are still very early in the process" of creating the 
assessment district and building the road, "and there could be problems that we 
will encounter as this moves closer to reality." 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems, all of the participants concede, is the path of the bypass 
highway. It would run through the affluent gated community of Fairbanks Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito Road, which would be part of SF 728, is already in place. 
Developer Ray Watt built the road to link Fairbanks Ranch to El Camino Real on 
the west. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Harvey, a consultant and spokesman for Fairbanks Ranch on the road issue, 
admits that Fairbanks residents aren't too happy at the thought of 10,000 to 
15,000 cars passing through the heart of their quiet community daily, but he 
admits that a road is needed to supplement the current narrow highways that run 
through Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Path 
</P>
<P>
So the Fairbanks community has an alternative proposal to avoid this "worst 
possible scenario" -- detour the Rancho Santa Fe bypass south along Camino Ruiz 
to link with future Interstate 56, a major highway that will link I-5 south of 
Del Mar with I-15 at Rancho Penasquitos. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the traffic that uses the Ranch roads now is headed in a southerly 
direction toward the coast," he contends, "and the Camino Ruiz route to 56 
would be much more direct." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey argues that the Rancho Santa Fe bypass through Fairbanks follows "a 
tortuous path" in its east-west course that well could boomerang on its 
creators and return frustrated travelers back to their former travel patterns 
through the streets of Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbanks leaders have taken no stand on their neighbors' proposed road 
assessment district, turning instead to the city of San Diego, in which a 
portion of the proposed bypass road lies. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council's transportation and land-use committee gave 
Fairbanks a unanimous but unofficial vote of confidence on its Camino Ruiz 
plan, ordering city staff to evaluate the assessment district to finance the 
Route 728 extension "after an ongoing San Diego County alignment study for 
Camino Ruiz is completed." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said informal overtures to Rancho Santa Fe officials to add the Camino 
Ruiz extension to their road-funding plans were rebuffed because "they said 
anything that delays us, we're not interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Paul admits that he wants to see the momentum that has built up in favor of the 
assessment to put the project on a fast-track to completion. He thinks that a 
bypass can be completed by 1992 at the rate that the project is moving. 
</P>
<P>
More realistic estimates by county transportation planners put the road 
completion at five or six years off, still much sooner than if the county 
continued its pay-as-you-go road-building program.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NOW IF HE'D CHANGED HIS BASSET HOUND'S NAME . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years back, the boys in the newsroom made a funny discovery about a minor 
candidate for mayor of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He had been arrested for driving around town naked. With a basset hound 
strapped to the hood of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Once the hee-haws died down, the discussion concerned whether this revelation 
was news. After all, the arrest was several years old and the candidate had 
little or no chance at winning, so why poke him in the eye? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a journalistic ethic was set: Vehicular nudity is forgivable (and thus 
forgettable), but animal cruelty is not. If the dog was hurt, then the incident 
was reportable; 
</P>
<P>
if not, let's forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Further digging showed that the dog was unscathed. Case closed. The candidate 
lost and later died, his secret safe forever. 
</P>
<P>
The hound on the hood happened during the days when it was the media thatprobed 
the background of political candidates. Now much of that work is done by rival 
candidates under the rubric of "opposition research." 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd District race for City Council, the campaign staff of incumbent 
Gloria McColl has dogged challenger John Hartley, 46, a real estate agent, with 
several oddities from his past. 
</P>
<P>
First was the lobster tale: that Hartley had been cited for selling lobsters 
from a pickup truck without a city permit. Then came Hartley's shortcomings as 
a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
And now word is out about John Hartley's Other Name. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to locate Hartley's academic and military records, McColl's campaign 
manager, Marla Marshall, wrote to Hartley for an explanation. Corresponding 
copies were sent to five newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley responded that he had changed his name from Bill Terry Glendenning in 
1973 to honor his recently deceased grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall immediately challenged the dead-grandfather explanation by noting that 
a 1966 birth certificate for Hartley's son uses the name Hartley, not 
Glendenning. More corresponding copies. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets curiouser and curiouser," said Marshall. If those comments have a 
Cheshire Cat ring, you're close. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley responded that the birth certificate was changed retroactively in 1973 
and that McColl's gumshoes had not realized that. His ex-wife is sending McColl 
a copy of the original, showing the name Glendenning. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think any good opposition researcher would know what the county's policy 
is about changing birth certificates," said Hartley campaign aide John Wainio. 
</P>
<P>
There you have it. Make of it what you will. 
</P>
<P>
Myself, I'm still glad the basset hound wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caterpillar Queens 
</P>
<P>
Small stuff: 
</P>
<P>
* I like that country-Western station that promises "12 records in a row with 
only two interruptions." Kind of like a direct flight with only two stops. 
</P>
<P>
* The Engineering &amp; General Contractors Assn. is having a dinner meeting 
Sept. 13 at the Del Mar Hilton, highlighted by the selection of 12 winners for 
the 1990 EGGA Earthmoving Beauties calendar. There are 36 contenders, all 
female. 
</P>
<P>
The second annual calendar will be ready for the Nov. 16-18 trade show at the 
Del Mar Fairgrounds. There's nothing sexier than a pretty girl and her 
Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grunion Grumblings 
</P>
<P>
It will never replace horse racing as the sport of kings, but watching the 
grunion run does have a certain charm. The silvery fish flop up on the beach 
during full and new moons in the late spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the Solana Beach City Council wants to cut down on 
late-night revelry on city beaches. So it voted to allow parking at its four 
beach parking lots only from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The council didn't reckon on the grunion vote. A councilwoman protested that 
the hours would discriminate against those who like to watch the sardine 
look-alikes shimmering in the moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Mike Huse is now under orders to find a way to keep the lots open 
especially for grunioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched them run once," he said. "It was interesting, but I haven't 
returned."

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people who complained of respiratory problems after breathing fumes from a 
titanium residue fire in Cerritos Tuesday were hospitalized for observation, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two 55-gallon drums filled with titanium shavings caught fire about 11:20 a.m. 
at the Titanium Sales Co. offices in the 15000 block of La Pluma Avenue, said 
Los Angeles County firefighter Dan Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Titanium is a metal that emits lung-irritating hydrogen chloride gas when it 
burns, said County Fire Inspector John Lenihan. The lightweight, high-strength 
material is used for aircraft.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRACKDOWN VOTED ON ILLEGAL SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve new city street maintenance employees will be hired to rid Los Angeles 
of the tens of thousands of signs -- ranging from political campaign posters to 
"lost pet" notices -- posted illegally on city property and parkways each year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council Tuesday appropriated $603,000 to gear up the clean-up program, 
designed to eventually be self-supporting via a series of fines assessed to 
residents and businesses illegally posting signs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council voted 10 to 1 to have the city attorney's office draft an 
exemption for real estate agents who post signs advertising open houses on 
city-owned parkways (between sidewalks and curbs). Agents may post such signs 
at least 30 feet apart from each other as long as they remove them by sundown 
and have permission from adjacent homeowners, the council decided. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs urged the real estate exemption, terming it "an 
established business practice of an industry that just about touches 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Marvin Braude, on the other hand, was bitterly opposed. Braude 
unsuccessfully urged fellow council members to reject the influence of the real 
estate industry and "bite the bullet and say we are going to clean up the 
city."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $15,000 REWARD OFFERED IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus on Tuesday asked the City Council to 
offer a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
the killers of Jerry Weber, a prominent Jewish official shot to death last week 
at a bank's automatic teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
The motion introduced by Picus will be voted on next week. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, 49, of Encino, a official of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater 
Los Angeles, was shot to death early Aug. 22 while sitting in his car after 
completing a $40 withdrawal from an ATM at a Wells Fargo Bank near Sepulveda 
and National boulevards in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting was a botched robbery attempt. No money was taken, and 
the unidentified gunman and an accomplice escaped in a car. Weber's wife, 
Sally, who was sitting next to him, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
A police description of the shooting suspect indicates he is a black male, in 
his late 20s or early 30s, tall and slender but physically well-built.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JUROR IN HOSPITAL FOR TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ailing juror in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial has been 
hospitalized for diagnostic tests and may have to be replaced by the last 
remaining alternate. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders ordered the other jurors to 
return today in the hope that he will have further information about the 
juror's condition from his physician. 
</P>
<P>
If the physician feels the juror will be unable to rejoin the panel next week 
-- when the prosecution has scheduled a key rebuttal witness, an expert in 
pedophilia -- testimony will resume Thursday with the alternate taking the 
ailing man's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have rested their cases, but rebuttal, surrebuttal and closing 
arguments remain. Pounders has vowed to get the case to the jury by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has repeatedly voiced fears of "the probability" of a mistrial as the 
number of jurors dwindles. Five have been released during the trial, now in its 
29th month.

NANCY REAGAN TAKES ON A DARE AT TWO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Reagan said Tuesday that she was never unwilling or reluctant to visit 
John Muir Junior High School, as charged at a Los Angeles Board of Education 
meeting, and added that she will appear at the South-Central Los Angeles school 
to present a $50,000 anti-drug grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Until news reports this morning, I was not aware of the controversy 
surrounding the location at which the Nancy Reagan Foundation will present a 
grant to DARE America for use at John Muir Junior High School," the former 
First Lady said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
She said she never received an invitation to visit the school to present the 
check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Any Reluctance' 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any reluctance or unwillingness on my part to visit John Muir 
Junior High School, nor did the Secret Service object." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy developed at Monday night's school board meeting when board 
member Rita Walters charged that plans for Mrs. Reagan to present the grant at 
Gates Street Elementary School in East Los Angeles on Sept. 14 was a "slap in 
the face" to the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Walters admitted Tuesday that when she objected she was unaware that the check 
presentation at Gates was part of a broader birthday celebration for the Los 
Angeles Police Department's anti-drug program, DARE. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Satisfied' 
</P>
<P>
"The statement that I made was based on the very best information given me at 
that moment," Walters said. "Had I not raised an objection the grant would have 
been presented at Gates Elementary School, miles away from Muir . . . I'm 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for Ronald Reagan's office, said Mrs. Reagan will 
appear at both John Muir and Gates. Deputy Police Chief Glenn Levant said 
organizers picked Gates Street Elementary School for the presentation ceremony 
because the school was the site of last year's DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
"In Shakespearean terms, this is much ado about nothing," Levant told United 
Press International.

EX-DRUG DEALERS TELL OF MIAMI-TO-L.A. SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A yearlong campaign by West Coast law enforcement officials to spotlight a 
shift in drug trafficking from Miami to Los Angeles -- and plead for more 
federal assistance -- took a turn toward the theatrical Tuesday with testimony 
by two former distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing bright red ski masks, the two men -- both now police informers -- were 
marched behind a white screen to tell a state panel how some Colombian cocaine 
importers began bypassing Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1985, I started losing business to the West Coast. . . . The Colombians 
were preferring straight runs into the (California) desert," said a Florida 
informer called "Tony Jones," his voice altered by an electronic device to 
sound somewhat like Darth Vader's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Hearing 
</P>
<P>
The two men were witnesses at a hearing at a hotel near Los Angeles 
International Airport before the Attorney General's Commission on Narcotics, a 
group of law enforcement officials from around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that 1989 should be the year Hollywood canceled 'Miami Vice,' 
because 1989 will also be remembered as the year that Hollywood, really all of 
Los Angeles, surpassed Miami as the cocaine capital of the United States," said 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who presided over the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
It was a message that Van de Kamp and others have voiced repeatedly this year, 
and with increasing frequency in anticipation of the Bush Administration's 
anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
* In January, federal and local drug agents announced that they had seized more 
than $100 million in cash from drug dealers in Los Angeles in 1988 -- more than 
in Miami. Federal Drug Enforcement Administration officials concluded that 
while Miami remained the major import point for the cocaine, about 40% of the 
drug entering the country was being shipped to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
* In April, top officials of the Los Angeles offices of several federal law 
enforcement agencies joined the Board of Supervisors complaining that there was 
an Eastern bias in allocation of federal drug-fighting resources. They called 
for an infusion of federal funds and manpower similar to the one in 1982 that 
led to the creation of a South Florida task force. 
</P>
<P>
* On Aug. 3, a report released by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Los 
Angeles street gangs have formed alliances with the Colombian drug cartels and 
are selling "crack" cocaine in every corner of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, Van de Kamp announced that he will seek $13 million from 
the Legislature to hire more than 200 new state drug agents, analysts and 
auditors effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, has also 
proposed construction of an 8,000-bed prison camp in the desert for drug 
offenders and creation of a state "anti-drug superfund" to distribute $1.7 
billion over eight years to local law police and governments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, considered the front-runner to be the GOP 
candidate in the 1990 gubernatorial race, has called for a $4-billion federal 
bond program to fund the Bush anti-drug program, which will be unveiled in 
September by drug czar William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said Tuesday that he has seen a draft of the plan and expects 
California to get from $60 to $80 million, which he called "a drop in the 
bucket, not enough." The day's hearing was designed, in part, "to get Bill 
Bennett's attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony," the Florida informant brought to the tightly guarded hearing, described 
himself as an expert in technical details of transporting drugs -- knowing the 
optimum weight of airplane shipments depending on the distance flown, for 
instance, or the safest overland routes from Miami to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
He said bribes to Colombian officials were an accepted cost of doing business, 
explaining, "If you do not pay off the Colombian air force, you will be shot 
down on takeoff." 
</P>
<P>
The cartel kingpins have "duffel bags full of cash" sitting around, he said, 
and in one case "the rats ate over $1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
The second informant testifying from behind the screen, identified as "John 
Smith," said he distributed about 10 kilograms of cocaine a week after getting 
it from Colombians in Los Angeles, who brought it through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he stopped, he said, "I was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
While California officials appealed for more federal assistance, two law 
enforcement representatives from Miami cautioned them that the federal presence 
there created problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Wilson, who oversees the Miami office of the Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement, said federal agents arrived who were "outsiders . . . they 
couldn't even find there way around," and were of little use for two years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, interagency rivalry "existed then. It exists today," with 
investigators from different groups often reluctant to share information. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he doesn't believe there has been a relocation of cocaine 
traffickers from Miami to Los Angeles, but simply "an expansion of criminal 
activity."

HAZE AT GRAND CANYON BLAMED ON POWER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coal-burning power plant owned in part by the city of Los Angeles was 
identified by the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday as a major source 
of haze that impairs winter views in the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The finding ignited a fierce battle in the Bush Administration over whether to 
require the Arizona plant to install costly cleanup equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, forced to act by a lawsuit from environmental groups, based its 
finding on a National Park Service study that traced sulfur emissions from the 
plant to the canyon's northern edge, 12 miles away, and to its center, 80 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Percentages 
</P>
<P>
"The study concluded the Navajo Generating Station contributes approximately 
40%, on average, to the observed haze and as much as 60% to 70% during the 
worst episodes," the EPA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the Environmental Defense Fund and other 
groups, the EPA has six months to decide what level of antipollution 
technology, if any, is warranted to improve visibility in the canyon. Estimates 
for extensively curtailing emissions from the plant's smokestacks range from 
$200 million to $1 billion, costs that would have to be paid by utility 
customers and federal taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The case has broad implications for other national parks whose visibility was 
ordered protected by Congress 12 years ago in an action that has been largely 
ignored until now. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona plant's six owners, a consortium that includes the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, assailed the 
Park Service study and called for a new evaluation of the causes of the 
canyon's deteriorating visibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Objections 
</P>
<P>
"Wet scrubbers (in smokestacks) would run in the neighborhood of $1 billion. . 
. . This is too costly to pass on to consumers without absolute proof that the 
station is a significant contributor to haze in the canyon," said officials of 
the Salt River Project, operator of the power plant and a 22% owner. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsing that statement, DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen added, "Ceasing 
operation of the plant a few days each winter might provide the most dramatic 
reduction in emissions that the plant could make." The DWP is a 21% owner. 
</P>
<P>
The owners received support from Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who said 
he wanted the National Academy of Sciences to review the Park Service study. 
Lujan's Interior Department includes both the Park Service and the Bureau of 
Reclamation, a 24% owner of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to take the appropriate steps to minimize the impact of the 
Navajo facility, once those steps have been identified," Lujan said in a 
statement that privately infuriated Park Service officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bush Factor 
</P>
<P>
Bob Yuhnke, an Environmental Defense Fund attorney who spearheaded the lawsuit 
against the EPA, said he is "very pleased by the EPA announcement" but "worried 
about the battle raging in the Administration, as reflected in the Lujan 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
Yuhnke said President Bush ultimately may have to resolve conflicts involving 
Lujan, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly and Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman, who is expected to raise questions about the federal costs of cleaning 
up the Arizona plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a question of whether or not Bush is willing to pay the price of 
protecting our national parks and cleaning up the environment," Yuhnke said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its six-week, $2-million study, the Park Service injected a chemical 
tracer into the Navajo plant's three 775-foot smokestacks so the plume of 
sulfate particles could be tracked. The tracer chemical was detected at Hopi 
Point, the main visitor area on the north rim of the park, the EPA said.

COUNCIL UNLIKELY TO OK ACCORD ON ELECTION-SYSTEM SUIT, ROBERTS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council is likely to reject a settlement reached in a 
lawsuit over minority-voting rights, Councilman Ron Roberts predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the "council will be disappointed" by the agreement hammered out 
Monday by attorneys for the city and the Chicano Federation, which sued the 
city in January, 1988, charging that the city's election system was 
unconstitutional because it hampered the chances of Latino candidates getting 
elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The city's attorneys briefed Roberts on the proposed settlement Monday evening. 
He said there are two items that will probably cause the council to reject the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The main stumbling block was the request for substantially more money," 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members favored an earlier proposal calling for the city to pay the 
federation about $10,000 in attorneys' fees, he said, adding that the recent 
compromise increased that figure substantially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees for Attorneys 
</P>
<P>
"The first proposal said attorneys' fees were not to exceed $10,000, to now a 
settlement with attorneys' bills in excess of $100,000," Roberts said. "If we 
agree to that, we might be talking about $200,000 tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Chicano Federation lawsuit charged that San Diego's two-tiered 
council elections -- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs between 
the two top vote-getters -- was unconstitutional. Earlier this year, the city's 
attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have the lawsuit dismissed by arguing that 
San Diego voters approved a district-only initiative in November, making the 
issue moot. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades rejected the city's request and allowed the 
federation's attorney, Patricia Meyer, to supplement the lawsuit last month 
with new demands. 
</P>
<P>
Another thorny issue that arose in the settlement is the federation's demand 
that the number of council districts be increased from 8 to 10 -- with new 
district boundaries drawn up by May, 1991 -- and elections held the same year 
in the new districts, Roberts added. That would be a "logistic impossibility," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has already agreed to put the issue of increasing the number of 
districts on the June, 1990, ballot. But if the initiative is approved by the 
voters, the City Council wants the first elections in the new districts to take 
place in 1993, Roberts said. That is two years longer than the timetable 
suggested by the federation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Way Out of Whack' 
</P>
<P>
"There are discrepancies between districts that are way out of whack. . . . The 
majority of the council was willing to say the districts are out of whack," 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the councilman, the federation's timetable for creating the 
new districts and having the first elections are all but an impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to base (new districts) on 1990 census data. But we won't get the 
1990 census data until April, 1991. . . . If we do it their way, we will 
already be in a period of time when the primaries are under way and people 
won't even know what district they're living in." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested drawing the new boundaries next year, without the 1990 census 
figures. The population figures that would be used next year would "be very 
close to what the census is going to be any way," Roberts argued. "Let's do the 
redistricting now, before the 1991 elections." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the new districts could be drawn up next year, Roberts said that he and 
a majority of council members would want the first elections to take place in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The federation's lawsuit also includes a provision calling for an independent 
commission to establish the new district boundaries, which are currently drawn 
by the council. Roberts said the new settlement calls for an independent 
commission but one that would serve only in an advisory capacity rather than as 
"a binding decision-making body." 
</P>
<P>
According to Roberts, under the proposal agreed to by attorneys for both sides, 
the commission would be allowed to make all the recommendations it wants, but 
the City Council would still have the final say on how the district boundaries 
are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Federation attorney Meyer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rhoades ordered both sides to return to court Sept. 13 to discuss the 
council's reaction to the proposed settlement.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illegal alien attempting to cross Interstate 5 in San Ysidro was struck and 
killed Monday night by a hit-and-run driver, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelio Carrasco Carbajal, 32, of Mexico, died at 8:45 p.m. on a stretch of 
I-5 just south of Via de San Ysidro, according to deputy coroner Max Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal is the second alien this month, and the sixteenth since Jan. 1, to die 
while crossing border-area freeways on foot, according to CHP officer Larry 
Urban. "That half-mile stretch in San Ysidro accounts for almost all such 
incidents," Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 28 pedestrians, most of them aliens illegally entering the United 
States from Mexico, were killed on the freeways near the border, Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists have long blamed the Border Patrol practice of chasing aliens 
toward the freeways for boosting the death toll. But Border Patrol officials 
have denied they use that tactic. 
</P>
<P>
Urban said that the Border Patrol has attempted to corner aliens near the 
freeways in the past, but said the practice was discontinued in January. That 
change, along with improved lighting in the area and signs alerting motorists 
of possible pedestrians, lowered the accident rate this year, he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 48-year-old man was shot and killed Tuesday morning in Chula Vista, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Antonio Flores, hometown unavailable, was found slumped in the 
driver's seat of a car parked in the 1500 block of Point Delgada Court shortly 
after 8:30 a.m., Chula Vista Police Lt. Dean Girdner Jr. said. Flores had been 
shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents reported hearing gunfire, then seeing two cars speed away, 
Girdner said. 
</P>
<P>
When police entered the home nearest to the parked car, a phone caller to the 
residence told them he had information about the shooting, Girdner said. But 
the man failed to show up or provide the information. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been unable to find the residents of the house and have no motive 
or suspects in the killing, Girdner said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tri-City Hospital nurse was arrested Monday on charges of sexually assaulting 
an emergency room patient, according to an Oceanside police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Morquecho, 31, of Oceanside was booked into the County Jail in Vista on 
charges of attempted rape, assault with intent to rape, and sexual battery, 
said Officer Gary Church. Morquecho, who is being held without bail, has been 
formally charged in the case, Church said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from an Aug. 9 assault in the emergency room on an 18-year-old 
illegal alien, Church said. Morquecho was on duty at that time, working as an 
interpreter for the woman, according to Church.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Marine was killed and another was injured early Tuesday morning when the 
speeding car in which they were riding slammed into a parked car in San 
Clemente, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, Lee E. Sears, a Marine based at Camp Pendleton, was 
arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide, according to Pat Dolphin, a police 
dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Sears was traveling at 80 m.p.h. in the 3900 block of South El Camino Real at 
1:10 a.m. when he apparently lost control of the car and collided with a parked 
car and two palm trees, shearing one tree, Dolphin said. The passenger, who was 
not identified pending notification of relatives, died at the scene. Sears was 
taken to Mission Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where 
he remained in stable condition Tuesday night.

ESTROGEN RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your excellent coverage on the increased risk of breast cancer 
with estrogen (Aug. 2). The study in the New England Journal of Medicine on 
which you based your report is one of several that suggest this association. 
Fortunately, newer therapies are being developed that in the future will avoid 
the risk of cancer and will prevent osteoporosis. UCLA is conducting a study 
using a nasal spray medication called calcitonin that prevents osteoporosis and 
has none of the side effects of estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully in the future women will be protected against osteoporosis without 
incurring other risks.

HISTORY OF WATER IMPASSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times editorial "Water: Still a Riddle" (Aug. 21) correctly concluded that 
the water impasse is the product of a complex political scene that requires 
statewide leadership to overcome, along with less study and more action. 
</P>
<P>
The public and many of our officials need to know that: 
</P>
<P>
* Decades ago, California devised a State Water Plan to meet urban and 
agricultural water needs into the next century. But it has been dangerously 
detoured, preventing completion of its main facet, the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
* The plan proposed water storage facilities to provide a firm yield, even in 
dry cycles, to meet such needs. But key projects were jockeyed out of existence 
by state and federal Wild Rivers bills. Witness the death in 1969 of the $245 
million Eel River Dos Rios Dam, designed to provide a firm yield of 900,000 
acre feet a year. Its cost today would be several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
* Water conveyance facilities provided in the plan, including the State 
Aqueduct, have been completed, but a gaping Delta hole remains -- a facility to 
get high-quality water south to farms and cities free of San Francisco Bay 
salts and Delta pollution. The hole exists because an integral part of the 
state plan, the Delta Peripheral Canal, was defeated in 1982 due to an 
overwhelmingly negative Northern vote and apathetic Southern support. 
</P>
<P>
Three major obstacles to a water solution exist today: 
</P>
<P>
1. The so-called water establishment, including water agencies, cities and 
counties, which are loath to adopt a hard line in fighting opponents of water 
development. 2. Environmental groups, which have made water development their 
prime target. The current national public concern over environmental 
degradation makes the selling of water projects more difficult than ever. 
</P>
<P>
3. A North-South schism over water. Northern California historically has voted 
against transferring water southward, despite recent Southern peace overtures. 
Three-fourths of this state's undeveloped water exists in the North. 
</P>
<P>
California is desperately in need of "statewide leadership at the highest 
level" to solve its water dilemma, as The Times puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian and his water director, David Kennedy, have backed away from 
forceful action, electing to try to keep all sides happy by offending no one.

DEATH IN BENSONHURST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent murder of a black teen-ager in Brooklyn was more than a crime of 
passion. It was more than a case of mistaken identity. It was a racial murder. 
The painful lesson of history is that such tragedies are compounded if the 
authorities -- or, for that matter, any of us -- look away from that repellent 
fact. This country has come a long way since those terrible days when Southern 
trees bore strange fruit, but not far enough to forget. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Yusef Hawkins, 16, went last week to the Bensonhurst section of 
Brooklyn to check out an ad for a used car. It is the kind of thing teen-agers 
do all the time. In this case, Hawkins and three friends were in hostile 
territory. They were confronted by as many as 30 white youths wielding baseball 
bats, according to police accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The subtext to this tragic confrontation reads like a primer of racial 
stereotypes and white anxiety: The white youngsters mistakenly thought Hawkins 
or someone in his group was the new black boyfriend of a white girl who had 
rejected a young white man from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The black teen-agers were singled out because they were black and only because 
of their race. Hawkins was killed because he was black. The racial hostility 
became clear when an elderly white woman who lives in Bensonhurst told Times 
reporter David Treadwell that black people were not wanted in that 
neighborhood. "Chase them, beat them up a bit, give them a black eye but don't 
kill them. They're human beings." It became even clearer when black marchers 
mourning the young man's death were met by white youths hurlingracial epithets 
and insults during a weekend protest in Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
As racial tensions worsen, there can be no shrinking from the truth. New York's 
political, civic and religious leaders must make it perfectly clear that racial 
attacks will not be tolerated. New York Mayor Ed Koch can make that point most 
emphatically by rallying the entire city to the necessity of racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Koch has condemned the racial assault but not without adding somewhat 
defensively that he cannot mold the attitude of every teen-ager and that his 
city has no monopoly on racism or murder. That may be true, but across America 
confrontational politicians, like Koch, have been all too ready to further 
their own careers by playing to the passionate animosities engendered by racial 
and ethnic differences. 
</P>
<P>
The Bensonhurst murder is the most recent indication of New York's racial 
tensions. It is being compared to Howard Beach, where a white mob chased a 
black man to his death in 1986. It is also being compared to Central Park, 
where a white woman was brutally assaulted while jogging earlier this year; six 
black and Hispanic teen-agers have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
The mugging in Central Park evoked a national outpouring of public anguish. In 
contrast, the Bensonhurst murder has prompted mere murmurs of condemnation. 
Coming to terms with the meaning of that disparity will not bring Yusef Hawkins 
back to life, but it will erase the fiction that his death was just another of 
those inexplicable, unavoidable urban tragedies.

DETERRENTS TO SLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrations, such as birthdays, tend to bring out the best in people. But the 
emotions that soar during these normally happy occasions can also swing low and 
turn dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly for Maria Navarro, her 27th birthday party in East Los Angeles turned 
into a blood bath as her estranged husband, Raymond Navarro, burst in and shot 
and killed her, her two aunts and her friend. He killed them after Maria 
Navarro had done her best to keep away a man with a history of threats and 
violence. She got a temporary restraining order and called 911 after a 
brother-in-law called her with a grim message: "Your husband is coming to kill 
you." The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told a frantic Maria Navarro 
that officers were helpless until her husband showed up to make good on his 
threat. He did. 
</P>
<P>
The most tragic aspect of these murders is that there were some things 
dispatchers could have done. One possibility is obvious: Since Navarro told the 
department that she had a temporary restraining order against her estranged 
husband, that information should have prompted the dispatch of a unit to drive 
by. Since 1984, New York City police have been required to respond to all 911 
domestic cases. 
</P>
<P>
There is another less obvious but valuable resource that the sheriffs failed to 
employ: Alittle-used state law allows for something called a telephonic 
temporary restraining order that makes it possible for officers to arrest a 
potentially violent person before he strikes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hugh McIsaac, director of family court services of the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court, this is how it would typically work: After a threat of 
violence, a woman would call 911. The law enforcement agency would dispatch an 
officer, then call a family court services "referee," who can be reached 
nights, weekends and holidays, and ask for a temporary restraining order that 
would be in effect until 5 p.m. the next day or the next court day. If the 
person who made the threat showed up while the officer was there, he could be 
arrested on the spot if he refused to leave. In Los Angeles County alone, there 
were nearly 40,000 domestic violence- related calls in 1987. Yet this year 
through July, telephone restraining orders were requested only 39 times. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a restraining order by phone takes only 5 to 10 minutes. Enough time, 
perhaps, to save a life. Maybe not. Law enforcement authorities argue that a 
person with a history of violence, in possession of the ubiquitous handgun and 
hellbent on murder will find a way to do it. That may well be. But we can't 
help thinking of what might have been for Maria Navarro, her two aunts, her 
friend -- and thousands of women like them.

SYNAGOGUE OKD FOR NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. PANEL ALSO APPROVES SCHOOL AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of some Woodland Hills residents, a Los Angeles City 
Council committee voted Tuesday to allow an Orthodox Jewish congregation to 
establish a private elementary school and synagogue in a neighborhood of 
single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning and Land Use Management Committee -- made up of Councilmen Hal 
Bernson, Robert Farrell and Michael Woo -- said the Beit Hamidrash congregation 
of Woodland Hills could establish a synagogue and school in a single-family 
house at 22760 Califa St. as long as it complies with 23 restrictions on 
parking, operating hours and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The decision overturned a ruling in April by an associate zoning administrator 
who held that the house was an unsuitable location for a school and synagogue, 
which he said would disturb neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Although he voted to grant a permit, Farrell expressed reservations. "You're 
putting a growing, vibrant organism into a space that's too small," he said. He 
added that there were so many restrictions that the synagogue might find it 
prohibitive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors who protested said they plan to appeal the committee's 
decision to the full City Council when the issue comes up in a few weeks. "It's 
not that we have anything against the religion," Fred Nixon said. "This is an 
issue of this operation that could be in a more appropriate place. It's just 
not the right area for something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Congregation officials said they would convert the house into an elementary 
school that could accommodate 56 children in first through fourth grades. 
</P>
<P>
The school would operate from 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, with 
occasional evening programs for parents. 
</P>
<P>
The structure will serve as a synagogue for 60 worshipers to attend morning and 
Saturday services. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Dov Ahoroni said he was heartened by the committee's decision. "We're 
very pleased, and we want to be good neighbors," Ahoroni said. "After all, we 
live here too."

FIRM ALSO ACCUSED OF SCHEME TO PUSH PRODUCTS; 
</P>
<P>
SALESMAN INDICTED IN ALLEGED BRIBERY OF NAVY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego salesman and the chemical supply firm he represented were indicted 
Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges they bribed employees of the Navy 
Public Works Center. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Irwin Levine, 31, and Polytech Industries of Los Angeles were named in a 
nine-count indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, Polytech's principal salesman in San Diego County, offered television 
sets, videocassette recorders, microwave ovens and other appliances to 
mechanics and repair personnel at the Public Works Center, prosecutors alleged 
in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the electronic goods, the mechanics were to recommend that the 
Navy buy Polytech products, prosecutors alleged. Polytech supplies chemicals 
the Navy uses to maintain its air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine and Polytech were charged with one count of conspiracy to bribe and 
eight counts of bribery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Sentence 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Levine faces a maximum of five years in federal prison on the 
conspiracy count and 15 years apiece on each of the eight bribery charges, or a 
total of 125 years, Assistant U.S. Attorney George D. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
He also faces a fine of up to $250,000 on the conspiracy charge and fines of up 
to three times the value of the bribes alleged in the eight other charges, 
Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the bribes is still uncertain, Hardy said. "I don't really have a 
figure on that," he said. "We haven't sat down and come up with a dollar 
amount. I'm not going to even throw one out." 
</P>
<P>
Polytech faces a fine of up to $500,000 on each count, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Navy employees pleaded guilty this month and last to misdemeanor charges 
in connection with the scheme, Hardy said. All were charged with "receiving 
extra salary for government work," and remain free on bail pending sentencing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that Levine not only offered merchandise but also set up 
a "point system" under which mechanics received credit toward goods for each 
$100 worth of Polytech chemicals ordered. 
</P>
<P>
The plan operated primarily in 1987 and 1988, it said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Polytech, prosecutors are "looking at other companies who worked 
with PWC," Hardy said.

COUNTY JAIL EMPLOYEE ARRESTED ON DRUG, SHOPLIFTING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department corrections counselor has been arrested on drug and 
shoplifting charges, a San Diego police spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Christine Schaefer, 38, of Mission Valley, was booked into the Las 
Colinas women's jail early Saturday on charges of possession of a controlled 
substance, being under the influence of a controlled substance and petty theft, 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reed, a Sheriff's Department personnel section supervisor, confirmed that 
Schaefer is a counselor at the El Cajon jail, where she reportedly had the 
authority to assign inmates to various facilities throughout the jail system. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Cooke, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, refused to comment on the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer was arrested at 1:30 a.m. Saturday at the Advantage store on Balboa 
Avenue, Robinson said. The arresting officer allegedly recovered $128 in 
merchandise, less than an ounce of marijuana, and three packets of an 
unidentified white powdery substance from Schaefer, Robinson said.

DAVIS SHIFTS STANCE, BACKS STATE-FUNDED ABORTIONS FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a significant shift, state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) acknowledged Tuesday 
that despite his longstanding opposition to abortion, he now supports taxpayers 
financing the procedure for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said in an interview that during his nine years as a lawmaker, he has 
opposed spending public dollars on abortions. But he said he now regards it as 
hypocritical for the Medi-Cal program to pay for every medical procedure except 
abortion for indigent women. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' shift was hailed by a pro-choice advocate as a breakthrough that could 
indicate a change in thinking among Republican lawmakers. A spokeswoman for an 
anti-abortion group said the loss of Davis' vote could be critical to their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to two Canoga Park constituents, Davis said: "As long as 
some abortions remain legal, there is no moral or equitable basis for making 
them available to rich women and not to the poor." 
</P>
<P>
Davis acknowledged in the letter that his position would not please some of his 
constituents. "However, I was elected to make hard choices and, in this case, 
to balance two very important rights, the right of a viable unborn child to 
live and the right of a woman to decide to give birth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Intellectual Dishonesty' 
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday: "I don't point my politics toward trying to please the mob. 
The thing that offends me more than anything else up here . . . is the distinct 
presence of intellectual dishonesty, so I say what I think." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides on the abortion issue say Davis' shift will be key in future Senate 
debates because legislation to eliminate funding for Medi-Cal abortions is 
typically passed by slim margins in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis appears to have a leg in both camps on the abortion issue. While 
staking out his new position, Davis also said he plans to introduce a bill next 
year to ban abortions after the 24th week of a pregnancy except when the 
woman's life is endangered or the fetus is brain-dead. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said such legislation could face an uphill battle. Lawmakers are 
increasingly under pressure to enact abortion legislation in the wake of the U. 
S. Supreme Court decision on July 3 to give states greater freedom to restrict 
abortions. Also, earlier this month, abortion rights advocates took credit for 
a pro-choice Republican's narrow victory in a special primary election to fill 
an Assembly seat near San Diego. The election was the first state legislative 
contest in California since the Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate Floor Debate 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief, said he first announced his position 
earlier during a Senate floor debate. Previously, Davis had said he opposes 
abortion but also opposes a constitutional amendment banning all abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Norma K. Clevenger, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, 
described Davis' shift as a breakthrough, partly because it could signal a 
shift in thinking by GOP lawmakers, many of whom traditionally have opposed 
abortion. Clevenger said it is important because Davis is "well-respected . . . 
he's been very independent." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Carroll, lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, acknowledged 
that because abortion funding is rejected by close margins, "we obviously can't 
afford to lose any votes" in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said she disagreed with Davis. To allow poor women to have abortions, 
she said, "you have to see abortion as a benefit, and we don't see abortion as 
a benefit for rich or poor women." She maintained that Davis is not "helping 
poor women by offering to kill their children." 
</P>
<P>
As for Davis' proposal to ban abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy, 
she said, such a plan would affect only about 1% of the procedures performed 
annually in California. "To us, that's still a significant number of children 
but a tiny number of those killed," she said.

EXEMPTION TO BLOOD LAW WOULD HELP ALLY OF BANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping into a political controversy involving Assemblyman Tom Bane 
(D-Tarzana), a Sacramento-area state senator has introduced legislation to 
extend a legal exemption that has helped a Sherman Oaks blood-processing firm 
sell one of its major products. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) is carrying a bill that would create a 
three-year exemption from a state law banning the use of blood platelets taken 
from paid donors. Platelets assist blood clotting during transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved 23-0 on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee's consent 
calendar Tuesday. It was sent to the Assembly floor, where it could be heard as 
early as Friday, but probably not until next week. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials and private blood banks have long opposed use of 
purchased blood, saying it could contaminate blood supplies because payment 
attracts indigent donors who are more likely than volunteers to be infected 
with hepatitis and other diseases. Since 1974 the state has banned the use of 
purchased blood in transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, however, Bane sponsored legislation creating a three-year exemption 
from the law, allowing the use of purchased blood if volunteer blood was 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Donates to Bane 
</P>
<P>
Bane's action touched off controversy because one of the few companies in 
California that sells platelets from paid donors is HemaCare Corp. HemaCare, 
located in Bane's 40th Assembly District, has contributed $4,850 to Bane 
campaign committees in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, HemaCare's medical director, Dr. Joshua Levy, is a longtime friend 
of Bane's and provided important medical referrals when the lawmaker was 
stricken in 1984 with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralytic and sometimes fatal 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Bane also drew fire by ordering a study of the relative safety of purchased and 
donated blood that would be financed with $400,000 from the state Lupus 
Appropriations Board. His wife, Marlene, chairs the board and Levy is a member. 
</P>
<P>
Bane and Levy have denied the platelet exemption was designed to benefit 
HemaCare. They also argue that platelets taken from paid donors are safer than 
those from volunteers because of screening safeguards and the process used to 
harvest them, known as hemapheresis. 
</P>
<P>
Under it, enough platelets needed for a complete transfusion can be taken from 
a single donor. By contrast, most voluntary blood banks must combine blood from 
as many as 10 donors to get sufficient platelets -- which proponents of 
purchased blood argue increases the chances of contamination by a factor of 10. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Health Services Department counters that studies have shown that 
paid-donor blood is far more likely to contain the hepatitis virus because 
payments attract high-risk donors. They also say paid donors are less likely to 
tell the truth about their medical histories on screening questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
HemaCare argues that those studies are outdated and irrelevant because its 
donors are middle-class college students and hospital employees, not Skid Row 
denizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exemption Expires 
</P>
<P>
A Bane-sponsored exemption for purchased blood expires at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle said last week that he is carrying the bill because "medically I 
think it's a well-established procedure to increase the safety" of blood 
supplies. "We should be taking advantage of all the wonderful technology . . . 
that would increase the safety of blood." 
</P>
<P>
He said donors whose blood is taken through hemapheresis must be paid because 
the process takes several hours and is "fairly unpleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Although it still supports voluntary blood donations, the Health Services 
Department does not oppose Doolittle's proposal because blood is needed to 
cover a shortage in Southern California, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said last week that Bane offered to carry the exemption bill himself about 
six months ago, but backed off after adverse publicity about his links with the 
firm.

2 MORE MEN ARRESTED IN BIRTHDAY BRAWL; 4 NOW ACCUSED IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two more men were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in connection with a 
triple stabbing in Burbank that left one man dead and two others seriously hurt 
in a brawl at a birthday party, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Don Goldberg said Jose Villa, 21, and Noe Ortiz, 31, were arrested at 1 
a.m. Tuesday in the apartment they share in Huntington Park. They were being 
held without bail on suspicion of murder at the Burbank Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Four men have been arrested as a result of the Sunday night incident. Police 
said Teresa Ponce, 53, the woman whose birthday was being celebrated, and 
Marbella Cardenas, 22, were also jailed when investigators found a small amount 
of cocaine in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The women, who share the apartment, were arrested on suspicion of possession of 
cocaine and were being held in lieu of $2,500 bail each at the Burbank Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sunday's party -- involving more than 30 people at an apartment 
complex in the 2300 block of North Ontario Avenue -- turned into a brawl about 
8:30 p.m. During the melee, three neighbors -- David Robles, 25; Audiel 
Gonzalez, 21, and Mario Jovin, 23 -- were stabbed. Robles died at St. Joseph 
Medical Center in Burbank. Gonzalez and Jovin were in serious condition at Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police called to the apartment complex arrested Ramon Ambriz, 35, and Santiago 
Ponce, 21, Teresa Ponce's son, on suspicion of murder. Both men were also being 
held at the Burbank Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said further investigation of the incident led detectives to Villa and 
Ortiz on Tuesday. He said there are no other suspects.

SANTA CLARITA SEEKS WIDE INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
REQUEST FOR SAY OVER HUGE AREA IS PRELUDE TO ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita has formally submitted a proposal that would give the young city 
some say over the development of 160 square miles of the fast-growing Santa 
Clarita Valley -- an area roughly comparable to the combined cities of 
Lancaster, Palmdale, Burbank and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the city's first step toward annexing the area, which makes up 
about one-third of the 500-square-mile Santa Clarita Valley. The proposal to 
establish the city's "sphere of influence" -- the area eligible for annexation 
-- was hand-delivered to the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation 
Commission on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is a state-mandated agency that oversees annexations and 
incorporations. The City Council approved a draft of the sphere proposal in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The area includes the 39 square miles within the city limits plus another 160 
square miles roughly bordered by the city of Los Angeles on the south, Ventura 
County on the west, Los Padres National Forest on the north and Angeles 
National Forest on the east. The area includes the community of Castaic but 
excludes Acton and Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed area also encompasses Elsmere Canyon, which is being considered by 
the city of Los Angeles, the county and a private developer as a dump site. 
Council members said they wanted to include Elsmere in the proposed sphere to 
demonstrate their interest in the future of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The area includes all the land that LAFCO removed from the original boundaries 
proposed by cityhood proponents in 1987. Incorporation activists originally 
wanted a city of 90 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The city's proposal said the large area is justified because the problems of 
growth and planning confronting Santa Clarita also face the entire valley. The 
principles of good planning demand that the valley be considered a single 
entity, the proposal said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has said it hopes to annex as much of the valley as possible. 
The proposal notes that the city has already submitted one annexation request 
to LAFCO and is preparing five others, all within the proposed sphere of 
influence. The proposed annexations are scattered about the city's periphery 
and cover at least 2,242 acres, the proposal said.

ASK COUNTING QUESTION, GET MANY ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just what is the population of Santa Clarita? 
</P>
<P>
Depending on who you ask, the city has about 113,000 residents. Or 127,000. Or 
147,000. 
</P>
<P>
State, county and Santa Clarita officials admit that the real answer may be 
none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1990 census is complete, government agencies can only estimate the 
population of the city that will celebrate its second anniversary in December, 
officials say. The figures vary because each agency uses a different method to 
estimate population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Williams, an associate planner in Santa Clarita, said he believes 
that the most accurate figure is from a marketing firm that recently estimated 
the population at 127,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning released a 
report that called Santa Clarita the fastest growing city in the county during 
the first six months of 1988. In that time, the population grew to 113,048, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
George Malone, head of the department's population research section, said the 
figure is based on the number of building permits and the size of the average 
household. 
</P>
<P>
The county figure is close to an estimate by the state Department of Finance, 
which said the city had 115,700 residents as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the official state estimate -- the one that appears on city boundary signs 
-- is 147,000. That figure, from the state controller, is based on a formula 
used to determine the populations of newly incorporated cities. The controller 
multiplies the number of registered voters by three to get an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
City, county and state officials do, however, agree that the controller's 
figure is simply wrong. "That's a little high," said John Malson, a researcher 
with the Department of Finance. "That 147,000 number shouldn't be bandied 
around. It shouldn't be quoted." 
</P>
<P>
But until the census, 147,000 is the official state figure, city and state 
officials said.

IRVIN IS SUSPENDED FOR DRUG VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ram cornerback LeRoy Irvin, in the midst of his best training camp in years, 
was suspended for 30 days Tuesday for violating the National Football League's 
substance-abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, 31, was a Step 2 violator, having tested positive for marijuana two 
years ago. He has been tested twice weekly since. 
</P>
<P>
The league does not release the substance abused in its statements but Irvin 
would have drawn the same 30-day suspension whether for anything ranging from 
alcohol to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram tailback Charles White, for instance, was arrested in August of 1987 
on misdemeanor cocaine charges. He was reinstated immediately because he was 
only a Step 1 offender under the NFL's new drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
White then received a 30-day suspension last summer, after he violated the 
policy again, although it was revealed that the substance was alcohol, not 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Ram sources said Tuesday that Irvin's problem was not comparable to White's 
life-long struggle with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin released a short statement through the team: 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that this has happened and I apologize to my teammates, coaches and 
fans. I will do everything asked of me during this suspension and hope to 
return ready to help the Rams have a great season." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin could not be reached for further comment. A spokesman for Irvin said the 
defensive back had gone fishing in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Orson Mobley of the Denver Broncos also was suspended for 30 days for 
violating the substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mobley, in his fourth season with the Broncos, last year caught 21 passes for 
218 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Irvin had become a prominent figure on the Orange County 
sports scene and was actively involved with youth sports in the Fullerton area. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of 16 Rams involved in the team's "Children's Football Card 
Crime-Prevention Promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Picture cards of the players, with crime prevention messages on the back, are 
to be distributed by the Anaheim Police Dept. to school districts in the 
Anaheim area. The cards will also be distributed to all fans in attendance at 
the game against the Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the suspension, Irvin cannot return to Rams Park until Sept. 
28 and will miss at least the first three regular-season games of the 1989 
season. He is eligible to return Oct. 1 for the game against the 49ers in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say other than obviously, it's a blow to us," Coach John 
Robinson said. "He is having a great preseason and working very hard. He had 
been a model of dedication and work. I think he's very determined to have a 
good season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a setback. We'll have to evaluate him during the suspension 
and his willingness to do what's asked of him, and we'll make a judgment about 
his future when the suspension is lifted." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin will not be required to enter a drug-rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he will continue with frequent testing," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson couldn't say what affect Irvin's suspension would have on the team. 
Either rookie cornerback Darryl Henley or second-year man Cliff Hicks will 
replace Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not there, somebody else is there," Robinson said of Irvin's absence. "I 
think it's disruptive if people start throwing touchdown passes over our right 
corner. Everybody obviously feels sorry for him, and feels a sense of loss when 
a teammate falls into these circumstances. But responding and adjusting to 
problems is part of the challenge of being successful." 
</P>
<P>
This is Irvin's second suspension as a Ram. He was benched for one game in 1987 
for "conduct detrimental to the team." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, who was nearly traded that season, had an off-year in 1988 but rebounded 
strongly this summer, intercepting two first-half passes against Phoenix on 
Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
To get down to the 60-man limit, the team released wide receivers Anthony 
Sargent and Brian Hawkins, fullback Robert Harrison, kicker Marty Zendejas, 
safety Greg Coauette, center David Diaz-Infante, tight end Gary Knudson, 
cornerback Louis Brock, tackle R.C. Mullin, and defensive lineman Byron Darby. 
Darby, 29, was a Plan B free agent acquired in the off-season from 
Indianapolis. Robinson said Darby was released early to give him a chance to 
catch on with another team. "We felt it was in our best interest to go with the 
younger people," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Free agent offensive lineman Mark Schmidt was put on injured reserve with a 
neck injury. . . . The Rams have received two-game roster exemptions for 
tailback Greg Bell and tackle Robert Cox, who signed contracts Monday. 
Robinson, however, says both will play in Saturday's exhibition game against 
Detroit, meaning he'll need to make two more roster cuts on Friday.

IT'S SOMETHING WILD AS METS BEAT DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This season's trendy nickname has been given to several relief pitchers, but 
truly belongs only to one. 
</P>
<P>
Ask any number of baseballs that have ended up covered in dirt. Dodger rookie 
pitcher John Wetteland is the Wild Thing. 
</P>
<P>
In threatening a Dodger record that has stood for 31 years, Wetteland's 12th 
wild pitch of the season scored Darryl Strawberry from third base in the 
seventh inning Tuesday, giving the New York Mets a 2-1 victory in front of 
36,756 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The wild pitch ruined the debut of Wetteland's slow curveball, one that helped 
account for a career-high 10 strikeouts. It ruined a night that was so 
impressive that Met second baseman Gregg Jefferies sent Wetteland a note: "You 
pitched a helluva game." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland said he appreciated the note. Now, if Wetteland can only stop sending 
batters a different kind of note, one that reads "Duck!" 
</P>
<P>
"I can accept the wild pitches because that comes from being aggressive, that's 
part of my game," he said. "But I cannot accept them costing me the game." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland, who spent the first two months of the season in the minor leagues, 
is nearing the Dodger club record of 17 wild pitches set in 1958. He is 
heartened by the fact that record was set by Sandy Koufax. But Wetteland also 
wonders if Koufax was ever hurt by the wildness the way he was Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With Wetteland dueling winner David Cone in a 1-1 game, Strawberry started the 
seventh with a double down the left-field line. Kevin McReynolds, who hasn't 
laid down a sacrifice bunt this season, decided to bunt for a base hit. The 
Dodgers were surprised, and the bunt rolled untouched between first and second 
base for a single, with Strawberry moving to third and Keith Hernandez coming 
to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you can get a guy to third base with a big hitter up . . . that can 
put pressure on the pitcher," Met Manager Davey Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what happened. Wetteland put Hernandez in a 1-and-2 hole but 
then, in his own words, "I tried too hard." 
</P>
<P>
A fastball that was supposed to be high and outside went down and inside, 
bouncing at Hernandez's feet and rolling to the backstop. It scored Strawberry. 
The Dodger offense only managed one baserunner after that in falling to the 
Mets for a second consecutive night. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland, who has as many wild pitches as any two Dodger pitchers combined, 
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to realize, I'm on the level as these guys, I can pitch to these 
guys," he said. "I've got to stop trying to do too much. I can get them out 
just being myself." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday should help. He gave up five hits over seven innings. His 10 strikeouts 
doubled his previous high. Of 104 pitches, 70 were strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland pitched good enough to beat most pitchers Tuesday. But not with the 
Dodger offense struggling and Cone on the mound. Cone gave up only four Dodger 
singles, all on grounders, only one of which left the infield. Considering 
Cone's history, it figured. 
</P>
<P>
About the only bad start he has had against the Dodgers came in last season's 
second playoff game, when he wrote uncomplimentary things in a newspaper 
article and then was racked for five runs in two innings. Usually, he keeps his 
typewriter and the Dodger bats shut. 
</P>
<P>
In two regular-season games against the Dodgers last year he won twice, giving 
up two earned runs in 13 2/3 innings. Two weeks ago, in his first start against 
them this year, he won, 3-2, by giving up two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
After he set them down 1-2-3 in the first, the Dodgers scored their only run in 
the second on three grounders. Eddie Murray led off with a slow roller that 
shortstop Kevin Elster threw into the Met dugout for a single and an error, 
putting Murray on second. One out after Jeff Hamilton's grounder moved Murray 
to third, John Shelby grounded a ball past first baseman Hernandez to score 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
It was Shelby's eighth RBI this season, and his first since June 7. But it was 
all the Dodgers would get. They managed only one hit after the second inning, 
In the seventh, Mike Scioscia hit a grounder that skipped past Hernandez. But 
Scioscia was stranded on first after a bad Shelby bunt and failures by 
pinch-hitter Alfredo Griffin (pop out) and Mickey Hatcher (fly out). 
</P>
<P>
Cone said he was inspired by Frank Viola's 1-0 shutout of the Dodgers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you see a good game like that, you want to follow it with another 
one," Cone said. "It has a contagious effect on a pitcher. You don't want to 
drop the baton." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland, meanwhile, said he thinks his good start will still carry over to 
his next start, despite the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I strike out some hitters on wild pitches," he said. "I'm not going to 
stop trying those things. I tried that slow curve tonight and, even though it 
goes in the dirt, it works. A lot of those pitches work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson wasn't the only Dodger to undergo left knee surgery Tuesday. 
Franklin Stubbs underwent a successful operation to repair a ruptured ligament. 
Doctors expect him to be ready for 1990 spring training. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor threw 52 pitches Tuesday, and looked good enough to warrant 
speculation that he could return before the end of the season. Tudor's first 
attempted comeback ended after 10 pitches on July 7 in Chicago. He could return 
in the team's final series in Atlanta. . . . Outfielder Mike Davis has set 
Sept. 7 as his target date for returning from a July 7 knee surgery. Davis is 
swinging the bat well, but is not yet running at full speed. "A lot of things 
could happen between now and then (Sept. 7), but right now I am shooting for 
that date," Davis said.

ANGELS CAN'T CONTAIN FENWAY TORRENT; 
</P>
<P>
RED SOX END BLYLEVEN'S STREAK IN 8-4, 13-5 SWEEP BEFORE STORM 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spirit of '86 knocked the wind out of the Angels here Tuesday night, with 
another resurgent Boston Red Sox team dragging the Angels through the ashes of 
yesterday's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
No postseason aspirations officially died here, unlike that lost October of 
three years' past, but Boston's overwhelming doubleheader sweep -- the scores 
were 8-4 and 13-5 -- left these Angels a bit more than staggered. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels trail the first-place Oakland Athletics by three games in the 
American League West 48 hours after pulling to within one. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, after escorting the Red Sox to their eighth and ninth 
consecutive victories, the Angel pitching staff was left in a shambles. Seven 
pitchers were required to slog through the mud and Boston's relentless batting 
order before a storm interrupted the second game after 7 1/2 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Had play been allowed to resume, Angel Manager Doug Rader would have had a 
problem -- he was out of relief pitchers -- but he claimed to have a 
contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we gone out there again," Rader said, "Kent Anderson would've been our 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Anderson plays shortstop for the Angels. He last pitched in a game in 
1984, back during his days at the University of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to go out there," Anderson said. "Have some fun. You never know, 
in the top of the ninth, we might have scored however many runs we needed." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, of course, was laughing when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, Anderson might have fit in with the rest of the Angels' 
not-so-magnificent seven. 
</P>
<P>
In a span of 12 innings' work -- eight in the first game and four in the second 
-- Angel pitchers served up 20 runs and 27 hits. Not even Bert Blyleven and his 
personal 10-game winning streak could withstand the deluge. In fact, he and 
Willie Fraser shouldered the worst of it, letting both games spin out of 
control before the end of the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven started the first game but barely lasted three innings, giving up 
seven runs and seven hits as he lost for the first time since May 20. 
</P>
<P>
As for Fraser, the best that can be said is that he completed the fourth inning 
of the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, take a look at what happened to the Angels during that fourth 
inning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before Fraser: Boston led, 3-2, and had the bases loaded with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After Fraser: Boston led, 12-2, after sending 15 to the plate in the 
inning. Fraser pitched to 11 of them, letting seven reaching base before 
getting an out. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser yielded six hits, walked two, threw two wild pitches and, on this 
evening's theme pitch, hit both Boston's Jody Reed and Angel catcher Bill 
Schroeder with the same delivery. 
</P>
<P>
First, Fraser plunked Reed on the left hip. The ball then ricocheted and caught 
Schroeder, back from the disabled list, under his catcher's mask, sending him 
sprawling in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stayed there long enough to bring Angel trainer Ned Bergert out of 
the dugout for assistance. A few groggy minutes later, Schroeder was settling 
into his crouch again, ready to receive more Angel pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Poor guy. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the night was through, all six members of the Angel bullpen had 
made their way to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Monteleone (14-3) pitched the last five innings of the first game. Then 
long reliever Dan Petry, making a rare spot start, worked the first 3 1/3 
innings of the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
The mess he left behind required salvaging by Bob McClure (one inning), Greg 
Minton (two innings) and Bryan Harvey, who threw two pitches in the eighth 
inning before the rain came. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Rader had Anderson loosening up during the 46-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we were very concerned about our pitching," Rader said. "I 
wasn't going to let Harvey go out there on a slippery mound. 
</P>
<P>
"That's basically why Willie had to suck it up in that nine-run inning. He had 
to stay out there for the good of the pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Rader sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the whole day," he continued, "it seems like a mess, as far 
as we're concerned. But, really, there were two innings that beat us -- the 
first inning of the first game and the fourth inning of the second. Those two 
innings are why we lost." 
</P>
<P>
Some innings, though. 
</P>
<P>
The first inning of the first game resulted in a 5-0 Angel deficit. Blyleven 
gave up a double to the first batter he faced, Wade Boggs, and trailed, 1-0, 
before he recorded his first out. 
</P>
<P>
After that out came a walk to Mike Greenwell, a strikeout by Nick Esasky, a 
double by Danny Heep and a three-run home run by Dwight Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Boston led, 5-0, and the evening's tone had been set. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert just couldn't find himself," Rader said. "He's been relying on his 
fastball a lot lately, but his fastball wasn't really there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Blyleven wound up a losing pitcher for the first time in 18 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"In all reality, his problem tonight was that he's a human being," Rader said. 
"It can be excused. He's certainly fallible." 
</P>
<P>
And so were the pitchers that followed him. For one doubleheader on a rainy 
night in New England, Angel pitching led the league in fallibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel breakdowns weren't confined to the pitching mound Tuesday night. Devon 
White took the Angels out of a potentially big inning in the first game when he 
led off the seventh with a routine single to center and attempted to stretch it 
into a double -- with the Angels trailing, 8-3. With Ellis Burks doing the 
fielding and the throwing, White had no chance on the play. Claudell Washington 
and Wally Joyner immediately followed with singles, but the Angels came away 
with no runs in the inning. Then, when the lineups were posted for the second 
game, Tony Armas had replaced White in center field, begging the question of 
Angel Manager Doug Rader: Did he bench White because of his base-running 
judgment? "Not in the least," Rader said. "I think Devo, in his own way, was 
trying to get something going. He just picked the wrong time to do it. 
Sometimes, a person with extraordinary skills will try to initiate something 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's first game, the Angels announced there were reactivating 
catcher Bill Schroeder from the disabled list and optioning his replacement, 
John Orton, to triple-A Edmonton. Schroeder was sidelined for 17 days because 
of a sore right elbow that will probably require corrective surgery during the 
off-season.

NFL SUSPENDS 13 PLAYERS FOR STEROID USE; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS' MRAZ, RAMS' KIRK AMONG THOSE TO MISS AT LEAST 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The National Football League announced its first crackdown on anabolic steroids 
Tuesday, suspending 13 players who tested positive, including Mark Mraz of the 
Raiders and the Rams' Vernon Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 players were suspended and placed on the non-football illness list for a 
minimum 30 days, which will force them to miss one exhibition and three regular 
season games. 
</P>
<P>
Mraz, a 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive end, is a graduate of Glendora High who 
attended Utah State and was a fifth-round selection of the Atlanta Falcons in 
1987. He played 11 games in Atlanta last season and was signed by the Raiders 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Mraz left the Raider facility before the announcement and couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Mark this morning," Raider Coach Mike Shanahan said. "He was aware 
of the new rule, on the first of April. At the same time, he informed me he 
hadn't been on it since that time." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Mraz was expected to make the Raiders' final roster, the Rams' Kirk, a 
1989 ninth-round draft choice from Pittsburgh, was not. At 6-2, 250 pounds, 
Kirk, was considered a smallish tight end by NFL standards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge mystery to Vern and everyone else," Ram Coach John Robinson said. 
"He'd not be the guy you'd think of as a steroid guy. He said he had pneumonia 
at the time and was being treated by a physician in Pittsburgh and one here. 
He's going to retake the test, but he is under suspension." 
</P>
<P>
The other players suspended around the league included only one prominent 
player, former Pro Bowl guard Ron Solt of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Solt, who is recuperating from operations on both knees, perhaps the 
best known player in the group is Maurice Douglass, a backup defensive back for 
the Chicago Bears who spends the off-season as an exotic dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Those suspended for steroids came from eight of the league's 28 teams, with 
three from the Buffalo Bills and two each from the Green Bay Packers, the New 
York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Most seemed to fall into the category defined by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Hogan, who in turning down the players' union request to stop the suspensions, 
said that the crackdown "could be fatal to a marginal player." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jet Coach Joe Walton said of his two players, running back Vince Amoia 
and wide receiver Bobby Riley: "I don't think either had much of a chance to 
make the team." 
</P>
<P>
Others suspended include: running back Sean Doctor and his brother, Tom, a 
linebacker for Buffalo, and a third Bill, linebacker Matt Jaworski; offensive 
linemen Mike Ariey and Keith Uecker of Green Bay and running back Keith 
Henderson and nose tackle Rollin Putzier of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL initially said Monday that "less than two dozen" active players were 
involved, indicating that about 24 players was correct. 
</P>
<P>
However, between Monday and Tuesday, the remaining players on the list were cut 
by their teams, according to league spokesman Jim Heffernan. 
</P>
<P>
The accuracy of the testing was immediately challenged by the NFL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Chris Dufresne and Mark Heisler contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEROID SUSPENSIONS 
</P>
<P>
The 13 players placed on the non-football illness list Tuesday for a minimum 30 
days for violation of NFL's substance-abuse policy by testing positive for 
anabolic steroids:

VON HAYES' 3 HOME RUNS LEAD PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Von Hayes was the whole show Tuesday night at San Francisco as the Philadelphia 
Phillies handed the slumping Giants a 6-1 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, benched last week for lack of hitting, hit three home runs and drove in 
all the runs as the Phillies handed the Giants their fourth loss in five games. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first three-homer game for Hayes, who has 21 home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes also had two doubles in a 9-1 victory over the Giants Monday night.

<P>
CUBS RALLY FROM A 9-0 DEFICIT TO BEAT ASTROS, 10-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs have been struggling for the last two weeks as their lead in 
the National League East has dwindled. And when they have won they have usually 
had to go extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Even a diehard would not have given the Cubs much of a chance at Wrigley Field 
Tuesday against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
After five innings, with the help of Rafael Ramirez's grand slam, the Astros 
were ahead, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs not only caught up, they won in the 10th when Dwight Smith singled 
with the bases loaded. The victory was only the Cubs' fourth in the last 11 
games. Three of the victories have come in extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was in the game only because Manager Don Zimmer, with his Cubs so far 
behind, decided it would be a good time to give Andre Dawson and his aching 
knees a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Two hits and an intentional walk with one out preceded Smith's game-winning 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 30 games left with a 2 1/2-game lead," Smith said. "But, we can't get 
overconfident. It was our biggest victory, but we've still a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs tied it in the eighth with four runs and Paul Assenmacher, recently 
acquired from Atlanta, pitched the 10th to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"Going from the Braves to the Cubs is my early present from Santa," Assenmacher 
said. "I hope there's more under the tree." 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh loss in the last eight games for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Cincinnati 2 -- Until this season Joe Magrane was known mostly as 
a fellow with a good sense of humor who had never quite lived up to his 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the St. Louis left-hander won the National League ERA title last 
season with a 2.18 mark, he won only five games. In two seasons with the 
Cardinals, the 6-foot-6 former University of Arizona star had only a 14-16 
record. 
</P>
<P>
This season Magrane has shown his potential. In fact, there are many who 
believe he is the league's best pitcher. Certainly, he is keeping Whitey 
Herzog's team in the pennant race in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane gave up a two-run home run to Cincinnati's Jeff Richardson in the sixth 
inning at St. Louis but that's all and the Cardinals won, 4-2, for his seventh 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who is the league's first 18-game winner, has won 13 of his last 14 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals scored all their runs in the sixth after former Dodger Tim Leary 
held them to two hits in five innings. Pedro Guerrero's single drove in the 
first run. Terry Pendleton followed with a two-run double that rookie right 
fielder Rolando Roomes misjudged and Tom Brunansky tripled to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
There were times last season when Herzog referred to Magrane as Migraine. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really, my toughest win of the season," Magrane said. "I couldn't get 
the leadoff guy out. I didn't put him on with bases on balls, but it seemed 
that every inning I was pitching from the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have won 12 of their last 16 games and remain 2 1/2 games behind 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little lucky out there tonight," Herzog said. "Leary pitched well. 
You win when you're good and lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's home run was his first in the majors and was only the fourth given 
up by Magrane in 199 innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 2, Montreal 1 -- Luis Salazar's infield hit with one out in the ninth 
inning scored Marvell Wynne from third base with the winning run at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth win in a row for the Padres and moved them to within six games 
of the Giants in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, Atlanta 4 -- Andy Van Slyke drove in two runs and scored another 
at Pittsburgh as the Pirates overcame two home runs by Oddibe McDowell to win. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Landrum gave up a run-scoring single to Lonnie Smith in the eighth, but 
went on to get his 19th save. DAN HAFNER

GIBSON'S HAMSTRING TEAR IS REPAIRED DURING SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exploratory surgery on Kirk Gibson's left knee Tuesday revealed an unusual 
hamstring tear that was repaired and is expected to heal by spring training 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well, and while we think he should be ready by the 
spring, we won't know until he has undergone the full rehabilitation," said 
Frank Jobe, the Dodger physician who performed the 90-minute surgery with the 
assistance of Robert Teitge, formerly a Detroit Tiger doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who was placed on the disabled list for the second time on July 23 
after playing with a mysterious pain, agreed to the surgery in hopes that a 
problem could be found and corrected. If nothing else, it appears that has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It was encouraging that we could find something definite, something that we 
could put a finger on and say there," Jobe said. "Kirk is much happier now than 
he was before. Anybody who feels pain but the tests say nothing is wrong, they 
start wondering about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe, however, cautioned that this was the first such injury he had seen in a 
baseball player -- usually hamstring tears are discovered and healed without 
surgery. This tear was found in a tendon just below Gibson's knee. Judging by 
the surrounding tissue, it could have been torn since last season, when Gibson 
missed all but one famous at-bat in the World Series with similar leg problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury is in the books, but of all the tests we know, none of them could 
show it without the surgery," Jobe said. "It is in a very unusual spot." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, last season's National League most valuable player, played in 71 games 
this season, batting .213 with nine homers and 28 RBIs. As a testament to the 
Dodgers' lack of speed, he is still tied for the team lead with 12 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson will wear a splint for about a week. He will then fly to Michigan to 
rehabilitate this winter under Teitge's supervision. Gibson is then expected to 
participate in January workouts at Dodger Stadium. BILL PLASCHKE

A second federal witness implicated Pete Rose in an alleged tax-fraud scheme 
involving a winning race track ticket in the trial of former Rose housemate 
Thomas Gioiosa. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony in the third day of Gioiosa's trial on cocaine and tax-evasion 
charges contradicted Rose's contention that he had nothing to do with the 
winning race ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has denied any involvement in the winning ticket, and Gioiosa has pleaded 
not guilty. However, accountant Joseph Mansour testified that Gioiosa told him 
he was claiming the ticket for Rose. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Gold Star Chili Inc. and Pete Rose have agreed to 
suspend the former Cincinnati Red manager's contract as a spokesman for the 
restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
William K. Stock, chief executive of Gold Star, said in a prepared statement, 
"The attention given recent events has so overshadowed our working relationship 
with Pete that even routine promotional activities have been compromised and a 
temporary hold seems prudent."

CARDINALS PUT LOMAX ON INJURED RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Lomax, hobbled by an arthritic hip that forced the Phoenix Cardinals to 
place him on the injured reserve list Tuesday making him ineligible to play 
this season, wants to give the NFL another try. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to leave the Phoenix Cardinals right now. I want to play again. 
That's my gut feeling. That's what my heart tells me," the two-time Pro Bowl 
quarterback said after the move as clubs had to get down to the 60 man roster 
limit. "The last three weeks, I've felt better than I ever have. I'm going to 
continue to work and get stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Lomax, 30, has been hobbled with degenerative arthritis in his left hip since 
the 1988 exhibition season. The nine-year pro was selected to the Pro Bowl in 
1984 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do whatever they want me to do -- help on the sidelines, help (offensive 
coordinator) Jim Shofner in the game plan, help in the passing game, work with 
the young quarterbacks . . . Maybe this is an opportunity to pass along what 
I've learned in my years in the league," Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
He has thrown for 22,771 yards and 136 touchdowns for the Cardinals and is in 
the second year of a four-year, $5.7 million contract that pays him $1.3 
million this season. All the money is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hogeboom, a 10-year pro who was signed to a four-year, $3.27 million 
contract last March as an unrestricted free agent, will be the starters 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Doug Williams and running back Kelvin Bryant were placed on the 
non-football injury list by the Washington Redskins, who also cut 13 players, 
including rookie quarterback Jeff Graham from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Williams damaged a nerve in his back while running on a treadmill during the 
offseason. He underwent back surgery last week and now must miss at least six 
weeks of the season as a result of being placed on the non-football injury 
list. Bryant, who has been injured in each of his previous three seasons with 
Washington, suffered a sprained cervical spine in an auto accident in July. He 
has yet to practice with the team this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Seahawks released 17 players, including quarterback Bruce Mathison. 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Joey Browner ended his holdout and reported to the Minnesota 
Vikings' camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys obtained defensive tackle Dean Hamel in a trade with the 
Washington Redskins for an undisclosed draft choice. Hamel is a fifth-year 
veteran who played in 60 games for Washington, starting 17. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers waived eight players, including six-year fullback Larry 
Moriarty, and placed two on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon McCallum, in the U.S. Navy since playing for the Los Angeles Raiders 
in 1986, was placed on the "reserve-military" list, which allows the San Diego 
Chargers to activate him at any time but prevents him from practicing with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also traded punter Ralf Mojsiejenko to the Washington Redskins in 
exchange for a 1990 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
In other moves, the Chargers waived safety Michael Brooks, kicker Steve DeLine, 
receiver Brian Bedford, running back Ronnie Williams and tight end Pat Davis.

LAKERS' DIVAC PROBABLY CAN DELAY ARMY STINT, YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Stankovic of Yugoslavia, secretary general of the Federation of 
International Basketball Associations (FIBA), confirmed reports that the 
Lakers' first-round draft choice, center Vlade Divac, also has been drafted by 
the Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Tuesday that he believes Divac, 21, will be able to postpone his 
induction. According to Yugoslavian law, he must serve one year in the military 
before his 27th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to have discussions with our army after it has made a 
decision, like all the armies in the world," Stankovic said on the first day of 
the annual International Olympic Committee session here. He was elected to the 
IOC last year. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think our Yugoslavia basketball federation will help solve the problem. 
There are some bad feelings on his part because we allowed him to go to the 
United States, and now it seems like we are trying to take him back." 
</P>
<P>
Although Stankovic won his campaign within FIBA to give NBA players eligibility 
for international competitions, he said that he has lost hope that the U.S. 
team in the world championships next summer in Argentina will include 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
As for whether teams such as Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and West Germany will 
be allowed to use NBA players from their countries in the world championships, 
Stankovic said discussions are continuing between FIBA and the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Puerto Rico from his office in Munich, Stankovic met with NBA 
Commissioner David Stern in New York. "We have many, many, many problems," 
Stankovic said, declining to elaborate. "My feeling is that David Stern wants 
the NBA players in our tournaments, including the Olympics, but it might be 
after 1992." 
</P>
<P>
On a related subject, Stankovic said that the world championships will be held 
in Argentina as planned despite that country's financial problems. He said that 
he has received three letters from Argentina's new government assuring FIBA 
that the tournament has not been jeopardized by the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials were upset when the first Winter Pan American Games, 
scheduled for September, were canceled because of a snow shortage. They feared 
that the international sports community would perceive Argentina's cash 
shortage as the real villain and become even more reluctant than they are now 
to plan events there. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia soccer fans turned out in record numbers last Friday for the U.S. 
national team's game against the Soviet Union's Dnepr team and were rewarded 
with a U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest crowds ever to watch the national team in the United States, 
43,356, saw Erich Eichmann score in the first half on a pass from John 
Stollmeyer and the U.S. made that goal stand up for a 1-0 victory at Franklin 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
If IOC members are disturbed by the massacre earlier this year at Beijing's 
Tian An Men Square, they are not allowing it to affect the ascension of China's 
He Zhenliang to one of the four vice-president positions. He is expected to be 
elected without opposition this week. 
</P>
<P>
IOC members also appear to be comfortable with plans to hold next year's Asian 
Games at Beijing, which, in light of the events at Tian An Men Square, might 
seem like an odd place to have a youth festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We have assurances from the Asian Games organizing committee that the Games 
will be held," said Kim Un Yong, an IOC executive board member from the city 
that staged the 1986 Asian Games, Seoul. "All construction and projects are 
going according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Seoul had a lot of problems, too, before the Games. I'm not at all worried." 
</P>
<P>
Speculating that because of China's political problems Beijing might have 
difficulty mounting a successful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, several 
European cities, including Paris, Munich, Frankfurt and Milan, have expressed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
But Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Australia, said that he 
saw no evidence on his recent trip to Beijing that the city has abandoned its 
plans for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that has been done for the Asian Games has been planned in such a 
way that it can be expanded for a future Olympic bid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's drug-testing laboratory, which is trying to regain its status as an 
IOC lab after having been decertified earlier this year, was criticized here 
this week by the president of the Soviet Union's Olympic Committee, Marat 
Gramov. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the positive drug test of Soviet shotputter Alexander Bagach at 
the recent European Cup at Gateshead, England, Gramov said that the excess 
testosterone in the athlete's system should have been discovered by the Moscow 
laboratory. Bagach was cleared by a Moscow test before departing for England. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Bagach's disqualification, the Soviet Union will not be allowed 
to send its entire men's team to next week's World Cup at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets were second to Great Britain in the men's team standings but 
dropped to third behind East Germany after losing the points that Bagach scored 
for his third-place finish. Only the top two teams advance. 
</P>
<P>
There were suspicions about Bagach after he improved from 11th in the Soviet 
Union last year to fifth in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
A perestroika note: Gramov recently presided over a Soviet Olympic Committee 
meeting to select a bid city for the 1998 Winter Olympics. There were three 
candidates, which reportedly confused the delegates because, for the first 
time, no one told them which one to support. They selected Sochi, which is 
located on the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC executive board did not act on Anita DeFrantz's proposal to ban all 
athletes who test positive for drugs at the Olympics from participating in 
future Games. If passed, the rule would not affect sprinter Ben Johnson because 
it would not be retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be discussed by the full session this week, then passed on to 
the executive board for consideration next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand how someone could be opposed to 
this," said DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles. "If we're serious about 
solving the drug problem, we say, 'That's it; you're not invited back,' to 
athletes who are caught." 
</P>
<P>
She said the rule also would cover coaches, trainers and anyone else who 
assists athletes in the acquisition and use of banned drugs.

<P>
The United States won its first major men's international basketball 
competition in three years on Tuesday with an 88-80 victory over the Soviet 
Union in the championship game of the World University Games. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson of Syracuse scored 16 points to lead the U.S. team, and Stacey 
Augmon, the only player here who also played on the bronze medal team at Seoul, 
added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
The title was the first for the United States since the 1986 World 
Championships. The United States lost on home soil to Brazil in the 1987 Pan Am 
Games and was beaten by the Soviet Union in the semifinals of the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson, who will join Augmon at Nevada Las Vegas next season, had 14 
points and 11 rebounds for the United States, which overcame an early 
eight-point deficit to take a 47-40 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They played slowdown and they played a little herky-jerky during a couple of 
streaks," said U.S. Coach Gene Keady of Purdue. "But we didn't expect to beat 
anyone badly in the final. We'd have been glad with a one-point win. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the U.S. image has slipped a bit. But at the same time, though, we 
wanted to be number one again. We feel we have a team that could stand on its 
own against anyone here regardless of the past." 
</P>
<P>
The United States took control of the game with pressure defense and inside 
dominance. The Soviets committed 19 turnovers to just four for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Goundars Vetra led all scorers with 27 points, 17 in the first half when the 
Soviet Union was able to slow the pace and take advantage of his outside 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Vetra, who also had seven rebounds, fouled out midway through the second half, 
all but eliminating any Soviet comeback hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Unites States' fourth gold in track and field came when Kamy Keshmiri won 
the discus with a throw of 214 feet 7 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Viorica Ghican of Romania won the women's 10,000 meters in 31 
minutes 46.43 seconds, the second fastest in the world this year; Ari Suhonen 
of Finland won the men's 800 in 1:47.13; Igor Lapshin of the Soviet Union took 
the triple jump at 57-1, and Larisa Nikitina of the Soviet Union won the 
heptathlon with 6,847 points, a meet record.

THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Still winless (0-1) at this juncture, minus its longtime coach, not to mention 
several players who have been transferred to other institutions, Oklahoma 
occupies the top cell in the college Bottom Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The Swooners dropped a 6-13 decision to Clemson in the Jan. 2 Florida Citrus 
Bowl and, through a fluke in the schedule, won't have a chance to even their 
1989 record until Sep. 2 when they play New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind them is equally winless USC (0-1), which lost its second 
consecutive Rose Bowl appearance under coach Larry Smith, the Bo Schembechler 
of Pac-10 bowl coaches. Smith shrugged off the Trojans' failure to attain No. 1 
in the Bottom Ten, pointing out, "Those preseason ratings are a figment of 
someone's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Notre Dame, forced to resort to six-man flag football because of 
numerous personnel losses, is rated No. 8. Southern Methodist (No. 20) is 
listed as a "probable" to field a team.

OPENING ROUT: Virginia (0-0) over Notre Dame (1-0) Thursday. (Expecting the

WINLESS BOWL: SMU (0-0) vs. Rice (0-11) (Sep. 2). 
</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
Beset by threatened cheerleader defections, a defense anchored by Too Old Jones 
and a lack of good, young quarterbacks, the Alamo Cowboys are favored to 
capture the Bay Division and go on to win the Bottom Ten's Stupor Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys were last year's Bottom Ten champions and back-to-back titles are 
never easy in the National Football League, but they seem to lack what it 
takes. New coach Jimmy Johnson promises that, contrary to his previous team, 
the Miami Hurricanes, the Cowboys won't be hit with many academic violations. 
</P>
<P>
Alamo will be pushed once again by two other Bays, Tampa and Green, both of 
which have imposing statistics. Green led the NFL last year in number of 
kickers (four). Tampa, meanwhile, is the only NFL team never to have run a 
kickoff back for a touchdown, a streak stretching across 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Pitt and QB Bubby Brister, who said at one point last year, "We 
may as well punt on first down and get it over with." It was such a good 
face-saving idea that the Steelers have awarded him a 3-year contract of nearly 
$1 million per year, richest in team history.

Nielsen, or any combination of the three.

<P>
GOOD NEWS: The NFL ruled that Cincinnati running back Ickey Woods can't perform 
the Ickey Shuffle in the end zone, but may do so in front of the Bengal bench. 
Or in front of Tony Mandarich, Marc Gastineau or Brigitte Nielsen.

VAN NUYS FILLS POST IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Van Nuys High has hired Bill Gordon, a newcomer to the Valley, to replace Kenji 
Mochizuki as the school's baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Mochizuki, the Wolves' varsity football coach, is leaving the baseball position 
because of time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, 42, inherits a program that did not field a junior-varsity team last 
year. The Wolves' varsity went 7-9 in Mid-Valley League play and finished one 
game behind league-champion Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority was to build up our JV program," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who coached freshman baseball for one year in the Glendora Unified 
School District 20 years ago, has spent the past two decades teaching junior 
high physical education in Hollywood and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time for a change. Everything was all junior high P. E.," Gordon said. 
"I was thinking of coaching for more of a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon applied for a transfer to the Valley, and Van Nuys called him for the 
job. He is also serving as an assistant football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that he's had excellent evaluations and excellent recommendations from 
everyone we asked," Van Nuys Athletic Director Rick Rossini said. "We've been 
told that he's a very consistent, very dependable person." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, meanwhile, acknowledges that he is heading into the unknown. "I know 
very little (about the Van Nuys baseball team)," he said. "I know there was no 
JV team last year and because of that, there are a lot of unknowns." 
</P>
<P>
One player with whom Gordon has familiarized himself is Lorenzo Morales, a 
returning all-league infielder who Gordon says will be central to the team's 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we have our work cut out for us," Gordon said, "but hopefully, we'll be 
competitive."

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: APHI FIGURE IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W. Carl Zimmerman, a key figure in a Del Mar investment syndication firm that 
was closed down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1984 after 
allegedly bilking clients out of $48 million, has been sentenced to 4 1/2 years 
in prison and ordered to pay $862,000 in restitution to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, a 56-year-old Rancho Santa Fe resident, pleaded guilty in September 
to two counts of mail fraud and a third count of being an accessory after the 
fact to mail fraud in connection with his activities as chairman of American 
Principals Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filed suit against Zimmerman and his associate Hugh Sackett, alleging 
fraud in the sale of unregistered securities and misuse of $10 million in 
investor funds. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, who was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John Rhoades, could have 
received a maximum jail term of 12 1/2 years in prison and restitution of $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman oversaw 82 limited partnerships at APHI that were formed to finance 
ventures in real estate, energy generation, research and development and 
short-term financing. More than 2,300 investors put between $80 million and $90 
million into APHI partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federal indictment, Zimmerman failed to disclose to investors 
that money collected from some partnerships was commingled or mixed with funds 
from others, a violation of securities laws.

Kenneth Thygerson, who resigned last month as president of Imperial Corp. of 
America, parent of Imperial Savings of California, has been hired as president 
of Western Capital Investment Corp. of Denver. Thygerson was employed by 
Western Capital's predecessor entity in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Thygerson ended his four-year tenure at ICA amid growing losses and controversy 
surrounding his stewardship, during which time he steered the S&amp;L into 
several non-traditional business activities, including junk bonds and mobile 
home and car loans. Soon after Thygerson's resignation, ICA reported a 
$34-million loss for the quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining ICA in 1985, Thygerson was chief executive at Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp.

officer effective Sept. 30. He will act as a consultant to Harry C. 
Stonecipher, president and chief executive, and will continue as chairman of 
the board. Aerospace contractor Sundstrand, based in Rockford, Ill., pleaded 
guilty to federal contract fraud last year and agreed to pay a $115-million 
fine, the largest fraud settlement in Defense Department history. Several 
shareholders have filed suit against the board and some officers, saying they 
should be personally liable for the penalties.

NEW AND USEFUL: LEG-UP CARPET PAD SUITS GOLFERS TO A T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golfers weary of turning into contortionists while trying to change shoes 
without scratching the car with their spikes may want to try Leg-Up, a 24-inch 
long, 12-inch wide carpet pad. It makes shoe changing easy and protects the 
finish of the auto. 
</P>
<P>
Leg-Up attaches with a Velcro strip to the inside of the car trunk. When 
changing golf shoes, flip the heavy-duty, bound carpet over the bumper and prop 
your foot on it. It won't slip and will help protect the car. Just fold it back 
into the trunk when you're finished. 
</P>
<P>
Leg-Up comes in blue, gray or brown and costs $19.95, plus $3 shipping and 
handling (California residents add 6% sales tax). To purchase by check or mail 
order, write Members Service, 11217 Old River School Road, Downey, Calif. 
90241. For MasterCard or VISA orders, call the company's toll-free number, 
(800) 424-9378.

Island Ice for Little Shavers 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for an easy way to make snow cones for the kids or frozen 
drinks for adults, consider the Hawaiice Ice Shaver S-200, a manual grinder 
that you can use anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The device, manufactured by Back to Basics Products Inc., comes with three ice 
cups -- 18 ounces each -- for freezing blocks of water or fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
When you want shaved ice, slip a frozen block into the shaver's hopper and turn 
the crank on top. You can adjust the blade for fine, medium or coarse flakes. 
On a medium setting, one ice cup makes about four cups of shaved ice. 
</P>
<P>
You can use your own juices or flavors or buy Hawaiice concentrates in 20 
flavors for $1.25 each. Add 1 quart water and sweetener, if desired. The 
shaver, which comes in black or white, retails for $29.95. A smaller version of 
the device is available for $19.95. Hawaiice Ice Shaver can be purchased at 
J.C. Penney and Best Catalogue Showrooms. If you can't find it in your area, 
contact Back to Basics Products Inc., 11660 S. State St., Sandy, Utah 84070; 
(800) 688-1989.

Finding Out How the Weather Is 
</P>
<P>
If you're planning a trip to Senegal or Sri Lanka, or even somewhere closer 
such as Death Valley, you may want to take note of a new worldwide 
weather-reporting service. 
</P>
<P>
Launched recently by American Express Travel Related Services Co. Inc. to 
assist travelers, 1-900-WEATHER offers weather reports -- including 
temperature, humidity and sky conditions -- for 600 national and international 
cities. The reports are updated hourly, a company spokesman says, and you can 
also get a three-day forecast for cities in the plan, which is provided by 
Accu-Weather. In summer, you can receive coastal beach and boating reports for 
U.S. locations; winter, ski reports and highway conditions for American ski 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
For foreign cities, the service also gives helpful information about visas, 
local currency and tipping customs, and voltage and electrical requirements for 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
The 900-weather number costs 75 cents a minute and is billed directly to the 
caller's phone. The number can be accessed from most touch-tone phones, though 
some hotels, businesses and pay phones block access to 900 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For American cities, you simply punch in the area code after dialing 
1-900-WEATHER. Overseas locations can be reached by pressing the first three 
letters of the city's name -- for instance, MAD for Madrid. To get a free list 
of area codes for the 600 locations served by the weather line, write 
1-900-WEATHER, 261 Central Ave., Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735. 
</P>
<P>
Address Kit Lights Up Numbers 
</P>
<P>
There's a new, inexpensive, lighted house number kit called Address Lite. It 
gives homeowners a low-voltage lighted address fixture they can put up to help 
emergency personnel such as paramedics or firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"This product will save someone's life because the extra time required to slow 
down and search for house numbers, especially at night, can now be spent in 
emergency assistance," said Robert Mikuta, national sales manager for Quest-Con 
Lighting of Whittier, the California manufacturers' representative for the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
The fixture can be hooked up to an existing doorbell system or powered by an 
18-volt plug-in transformer. Mikuta says it requires only a drill and a 
screwdriver to install. It runs on two automotive taillight bulbs (14 volts 
each) and can be run 24 hours a day, he estimated, for about $5 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Address Lite is a white acrylic plate to which 4-inch-high self-adhesive black 
vinyl numbers can be affixed. The plate will hold five numbers; it fits on a 
black acrylic mounting plate -- 10x5 inches -- that attaches to the house. 
</P>
<P>
The fixture, plus two sheets of numbers, bulbs, 10 feet of wire, connectors and 
fasteners, costs $24.95. The transformer is $9.95 more. Add $2.27 sales tax in 
California. Shipping and handling is $2.75. If you want the factory to 
pre-address the light, add $2. To order, write Quest-Con Lighting, 14116 E. 
Whittier Blvd., Suite 504, Whittier, Calif 90605; (213) 943-8262. LYNN SIMROSS

PAULINE COLLINS BRINGS HER 'VALENTINE' TO THE SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Awfully smart of the adapters of "Shirley Valentine" (selected theaters) to 
hang on to big-eyed Pauline Collins, the authentic jewel in their gaudy crown. 
Without Collins' waves of honesty, her enveloping warmth and the unhurried, 
confiding way about her delivery, we might well be left to wonder what all the 
fuss was about in this comedy-drama about a salty Liverpool housewife who, to 
her own astonishment, does something about the dead-end shape to her life. 
</P>
<P>
In Liverpool and then London's West End, Collins created Shirley Valentine and 
every other character in Willy Russell's play, which at that time was a full 
evening's entertainment with a single performer, the indefatigable Collins 
herself. After collecting England's Olivier Award for her pains, she moved with 
the play to New York where she won a Tony and, from all accounts, 
Manhattanites' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
That was still no insurance that she'd be the one to make the movie, however. 
As film deals are put together these days, it's a wonder that "Shirley 
Valentine" doesn't star Goldie Hawn, Elizabeth Taylor or Shirley MacLaine -- 
and that is without the slightest disrespect to the singular moxie of any of 
these women. But it would be as unthinkable as separating Judy Holliday from 
"Born Yesterday" or, for that matter, "Alfie" from Michael Caine. 
</P>
<P>
So the powers that are -- notably producer-director Lewis Gilbert and 
playwright-screenwriter Russell, the team behind "Educating Rita," and 
executive producer John Dark -- are owed a considerable debt of gratitude for 
letting Collins, who looks a bit like Joanna Cassidy's unpretentious English 
cousin, re-create her personal triumph. 
</P>
<P>
But honestly, Collins' vehicle is a creaky old donkey cart. (Husband Joe, in 
unbelieving astonishment that supper isn't on the table at 6 sharp one night: 
"You're going 'round the bend!" Shirley, with equanimity, " 'Ope so, I've 
always wanted to travel.") It's also been whittled down to something less of a 
tour de force now that each of her supporting characters is embodied by other 
actors, notably Tom Conti as Greek taverna owner Costas, Bernard Hill as her 
bluff "oppressor" Joe, and Joanna Lumley as her grade-school nemesis Marjorie. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is plenty left for Collins to get her back into. While frying up 
steak and eggs for husband Joe's supper, and ruminating on her situation, 
42-year old Shirley has the habit of chatting to her kitchen wall or, in other 
situations, to an Aegean rock. Then, with a roll of those enormous blue eyes, 
she lets us know she knows exactly how daft that may seem. 
</P>
<P>
Soliloquy isn't actually what feels baffling about "Shirley Valentine," it's 
timing. Are the English really just discovering that many women who hit 40 find 
their lives unrewarding, their kids unappreciative and their husbands 
selectively deaf? Or is it just in these well-manicured vehicle-plays, as 
carefully balanced as Pritikin to be titillating but not too salty, bold but 
not too brassy. You can agree with Shirley's every complaint, and perhaps add a 
few of your own, and still feel an odd sense of time warp about these 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
What separates Shirley from her masses of fellow-sufferers is her edge of 
self-knowledge and her bravery. When her best friend -- now divorced -- wins a 
two-week vacation in Greece and impulsively suggests that Shirley come too, the 
yearning Liverpudlian cooks two weeks of frozen dinners for Joe, sticks a note 
on her "Come to Sunny Greece" kitchen calendar and is off. Not without 
trepidation, or a sense of the giddy impossibility of it all, but truly, safely 
off. (Of course, the film makers have loaded the dice slightly by casting 
"Bellman and True's" many-layered Hill as Joe.) 
</P>
<P>
Being Shirley, she is able to appreciate everything she encounters: the quality 
of light, the unfamiliar food, the cautiously friendly Costas, reassuring her 
at every step of the propriety of his invitation to take her sightseeing around 
the island on his brother's boat. (The film's R rating comes primarily from 
Costas' unbridled English, which savors one particular word too many times for 
the MPAA, and from fleeting nudity.) 
</P>
<P>
And being no fools, Gilbert and Russell pull out every stop in sketching 
Shirley's fellow-travelers. Her best buddy deserts her; her picky, boisterous 
Manchester hotel mates, Jeanette and Dougie, mortify her. (If you saw "Rita, 
Sue and Bob Too," you'll recognize George Costigan, the gap-toothed randy Bob, 
as this smotheringly friendly Dougie.) 
</P>
<P>
Does Shirley find herself appreciated at last? You betcha. No one with any 
shred of soul could wish her any less. Alas, the film makers' method of 
informing us of this is to have Costas' boat rock tellingly at anchor, while 
the sea ebbs and flows onto the shore and climactic moments from "The Firebird" 
fill the sound track. And those are the moments that blight this film at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
And still actress Collins prevails. Should she go back? Why should she go back? 
Why, indeed, shouldn't she stay? None of this seems unimportant, in Collins' 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Shirley makes announcements -- "I used to be the mother. I used to be 
the wife. Now I'm Shirley Valentine again" -- you want to tuck your arm in 
hers, get her talking about other things and have a good long walk up that 
beach with her, in the setting Mediterranean sun.

"The Wave" has crashed. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m. Thursday, KSWV-FM (102.9) will drop the satellite-delivered format, 
which features New Age music often described as "elevator jazz," in favor of a 
classic-rock format. Beginning Thursday night, the station will be known as 
KSDO-FM, "Classic 103." 
</P>
<P>
Pioneered in Los Angeles in 1987, The Wave format was quickly picked up by 
dozens of stations throughout the country. The Wave premiered in San Diego in 
October, 1987, to much media attention, replacing a Top 40 format.

But in San Diego, as in many other areas of the country, The Wave was never 
able to generate anything more than a ratings swell. In the latest ratings 
book, KSWV earned a dismal 1.9 share among listeners 12 and older, compared to 
a 3.1 for KIFM (98.1), its main musical competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just not the kind of station that generated ratings," said Mike 
Shields, general manager of the Gannett-owned KSDO-AM and -FM. 
</P>
<P>
To orchestrate the switch to classic rock, Shields has hired Larry Bruce 
Communications as a consultant. Bruce, who was program director of perennial 
album-oriented rock ratings power KGB-FM (101.5) from 1980 to 1986, will be 
program director for the new format, and Elizabeth Burley, another KGB alumna, 
will serve as promotions director. 
</P>
<P>
Shields said KSDO-FM will begin hiring on-air personalities next week. The only 
recognizable personality of The Wave, which originally was without any live 
disc jockeys, was Art Good, who is now out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
Shields said the new "Classic 103" will target listeners ages 25 to 44, 
primarily men, which, from an advertising sales perspective, will complement 
the news-talk listeners of KSDO-AM (1130). The format will put the station in 
competition with several others, including KGB, the oldies of KCBQ (Eagle 105) 
and KGMG-FM (Magic 102), which currently bills itself as "San Diego's Only 
Classic Rock" station. 
</P>
<P>
Shields said the station will feature "pure classic rock," the album-oriented 
rock hits of the '60s and '70s, not including some of the current hits in the 
Magic 102 format. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research shows that the adult rock audience we're targeting doesn't want a 
station exclusively living in the past," said Magic 102 Program Director Greg 
Stevens, adding that he will have to wait and see what kind of songs "Classic 
103" programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think this is the ideal (audience) for two stations to split 
up," Stevens said. "I think the niche is best served by one classic station." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we're going to be aware of what they're up to," said KGB Program 
Director Ted Edwards. "Now that it's a fact, we'll deal with it as it comes. We 
take a company like Gannett very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of the demise of The Wave had been circulating for several weeks, but 
weren't confirmed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at KSDO are quality broadcasters," said KIFM General Manager Bruce 
Walton. "They had to see that The Wave was going nowhere."

<P>
KPBS' HISPANIC AFFAIRS OFFICER MAKES CONTACT IN DOCUMENTARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in his cramped KPBS-TV office, reflecting on his academic career, Paul 
Espinosa saw a link between the degrees in anthropology he earned from Stanford 
University and his current role as head of KPBS' Office of Hispanic Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Anthropologists try to tell people about other people not like themselves," 
Espinosa said. "In essence, they're working as mediators between different 
cultural groups. In a sense, that is what I'm trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Through public television, I'm trying to address a general audience about 
Hispanics in a way they can understand. . . . I'm trying to establish contact." 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa, 39, made such contact with "In the Shadow of the Law," and not simply 
with local audiences. The 1988 documentary tracing the lives of four 
undocumented families living in the United States was recently nominated for a 
national Emmy, the first such honor for KPBS (Channel 15). 
</P>
<P>
"In the Shadow of the Law" was selected in the category of 
</P>
<P>
Outstanding News and Documentary Program Achievement, Special 
</P>
<P>
Classification. The awards will be presented Sept. 12 at a black-tie dinner at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although the success of "In the Shadow" is unprecedented at KPBS, at least in 
terms of the Emmy nomination, the subject matter is in many ways typical of 
Espinosa's work there. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Hispanic Affairs was created in 1980, with Espinosa as its first 
director, to provide programming -- on the Hispanic experience and the 
interaction between the United States and Mexico -- for both KPBS and the 
national Public Broadcasting System, Since 1980, Espinosa has produced, written 
and been host on more than 50 programs for KPBS. 
</P>
<P>
"I see what I'm doing as twofold," he said. "I want to produce programs that 
are interesting and important to Hispanics but also programs important to the 
general audience that is non-Hispanic. . . . The larger community has a role in 
shaping how the Hispanic community is treated." 
</P>
<P>
In discussing programming, Espinosa often sounds like the anthropologist he 
originally intended to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to provide some connection points" between the Hispanic community and 
the general audience, he said. "The loves and aspirations of the Hispanic 
community are not that different from the audience's own aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa grew up in a culturally integrated atmosphere: Albuquerque, N.M., with 
its large Hispanic and Indian populations. There, he said, Hispanic role models 
-- elected officials, teachers and doctors -- are commonplace, unlike in most 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, on Cinco de Mayo, they throw on a sombrero," said Espinosa, who 
called the culture here "more diluted in a way. While growing up, I had a 
natural respect for cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa's credits include "The Lemon Grove Incident," an hourlong docudrama 
about the nation's first successful legal challenge to school segregation, and 
"The Trail North," a half-hour documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen, 
recounting one family's journey from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole treatment by the media of the undocumented has been superficial and 
very stereotypical," Espinosa said. "We've been inundated with images of people 
arrested at the border, hands on head, helicopter whirling overhead. It's a 
very limited image." 
</P>
<P>
"In the Shadow of the Law" went beyond the stereotypes to show how four 
families managed to live in the United States despite their illegal status. All 
four had been in this country more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps that Paul's educational background is in anthropology," said Eduardo 
Diaz, director of the city of San Antonio, Texas' Department of Arts and 
Cultural Affairs and the former director of an international Hispanic 
film-video festival at which Espinosa's work has been screened. "He looks at a 
subject from a real inclusive perspective. I'm always impressed that he goes 
beyond the basic facts and looks at the human perspective." 
</P>
<P>
"In the Shadow of the Law" originally aired on KPBS in November, 1987, and was 
repeated on the national PBS system in February, 1988. It was produced and 
co-written by Espinosa and would not have been made if not for a $170,000 grant 
he won from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Competition for such money is fierce, but Espinosa is considered a master of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to write proposals and raise funds -- it's a real skill," ex-KPBS 
producer Matthew Eisen said. 
</P>
<P>
After earning his bachelor's degree in anthropology from Brown University in 
Providence, R.I., Espinosa spent a year writing grant proposals for the school. 
It is his writing experience, as much as the network of contacts he has 
developed within the industry, that has led to Espinosa's success in winning 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be able to really communicate quickly and effectively and catch 
people's attention," he said. "That may be more important than politicking." 
</P>
<P>
Espinosa never took a course in broadcast journalism during his academic 
career, which culminated with a Ph.D. in anthropology from Stanford. In fact, 
his family never owned a television set until he was 16 years old. It wasn't 
that they couldn't afford one; they just had no interest in it. Espinosa 
himself avoided TV ownership until he was 26. 
</P>
<P>
His first exposure to television was as an intern with KPBS' science office. 
Intrigued, he did his dissertation for Stanford on the "Lou Grant" show, 
tracking the development of issue-oriented episodes. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed in touch with KPBS and jumped at the Hispanic-affairs post. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intrigued with the idea of doing documentaries, the idea of doing 
programs that are not trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
In a PBS system in which five or six stations produce the vast majority of the 
programming, Espinosa has had unusual success getting programs on the national 
schedule. "Uneasy Neighbors," his recent documentary produced for KPBS on the 
plight of undocumented workers living in wealthy North County communities, was 
recently added to the national schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"He is associated with quality Hispanic programming," said Gail Christian, 
director of news and special projects for PBS. "Yes, his track record helps" in 
getting programs on the national system, she said, "but each program stands on 
its own merits." 
</P>
<P>
The Hispanic-affairs department is housed in two tiny offices in the KPBS 
headquarters. Espinosa's office, cluttered with videotapes, files and mementos 
from shows, is barely big enough for his swivel chair to turn around in. He is 
aided by one part-time employee, but assembles teams for each production. 
</P>
<P>
Besides arranging funding for his project ideas, Espinosa spends much of his 
time in pre-production, scouting filming locations, writing scripts, 
interviewing prospective subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really grown since the first days of doing standard interview-structured 
shows," said Frank Christopher, director of "In the Shadow of the Law" and a 
frequent collaborator with Espinosa. 
</P>
<P>
Long an expert at the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing of television 
production, Christopher said, Espinosa is now better in the field, more willing 
to deal with people and spontaneous events. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul is not necessarily an extroverted person. He's thoughtful and 
hard-working, very methodical. He understands all the issues, and more and more 
he grasps the visual potential of scenes and story angles." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher and Espinosa are working on another documentary, "The New Tijuana," 
funded by a $230,000 grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The 
project was originally turned down by CPB, but Espinosa revised and resubmitted 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is targeted toward a national audience, will look, through 
the eyes of several Tijuana residents, at the many cultures and life styles 
that exist side by side in the booming city.

Live snakes sent to video rental shop owners in London to promote a horror film 
will be retrieved and the stunt will be canceled because of public outcry, the 
organizers said Tuesday. Cinema International Corp., which began sending out 
700 Chinese rat snakes to shops nationwide last week as part of a promotional 
package for the video release of the film "The Serpent and the Rainbow," said 
it was worried about the nonpoisonous reptiles. "We were worried that all this 
unwarranted attention could get the public overly interested in the snakes, and 
result in them coming to harm," said Paul Brett, the company's marketing 
manager. "We thought the best thing to do was to take them back." The Royal 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had a different view on what 
might cause the snakes harm. It pointed out that directions accompanying the 
snakes had incorrectly said they didn't need to be fed during what Cinema 
International planned as the snakes' monthlong stay in the shops. But an RSPCA 
spokeswoman said Tuesday it welcomed the end of the promotion, adding 
"obviously CIC has seen the error of its ways, and we're very pleased about 
that."ALEENE MacMINN

Overload: The computer system in Oslo, Norway, which was to handle tickets to a 
concert by former Beatle Paul McCartney, collapsed just minutes after the sale 
started Monday because of the huge demand. Plans were to sell tickets all over 
Norway so that everyone would have a fair chance, but with the computer 
overwhelmed, sales were continued through ticket booths in six of Norway's main 
towns. A spokesman said Tuesday that all 5,700 tickets for the Sept. 26 opening 
concert of McCartney's first world tour in 13 years sold out within hours. The 
ticket rush in Norway reflected what also happened Monday in Los Angeles where 
McCartney's November dates at the Forum were sold out in a flash. ALEENE

Singer Engelbert Humperdinck planned to cross the picket lines and open a 
two-week engagement at the Las Vegas Hilton Tuesday as scheduled, despite a 
strike by musicians. A hotel spokesman said Humperdinck cited an obligation to 
his fans and his band as the primary reasons for going ahead with his 
engagement. Humperdinck was the first singer to cross picket lines established 
by Musicians Local 369 at five major Las Vegas resorts in a dispute over the 
use of taped rather than live music. ALEENE MacMINN

The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved guidelines that for the first 
time will allow city funding for individual artists. Under the new guidelines 
(which also permit non-matching entry level grants for emerging arts groups 
with a less than three-year history), the city can provide non-matching grants 
of $1,000 to $15,000 in direct fees and/or production costs for artists or 
designers to create publicly accessible artworks or artworks for nonprofit 
institutions that are unable to pay artists' fees. Fundable projects include 
artist-in-residence programs, public performances, murals and design projects. 
The guidelines apply to projects scheduled to begin after Jan. 1 and be 
completed before June 30. The grant application deadline is Oct. 2. ALEENE

ANIMATION, ANIMOSITY FROM JOE JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That Joe Jackson sure seems to be one arrogant chap, not to mention a surly 
cynic, contemptuous cuss and all-around critical dude. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah -- he's something of a snob as well. 
</P>
<P>
But those are likely the very qualities that have allowed the New York-based 
Englishman to carve out an ambitious and distinctive body of uncompromising pop 
over the past decade, much of which was on display Monday at the Wiltern 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 2 1/2-hour set covered both the wiry singer's eclectic career and -- 
in two six-song suites presenting his entire latest album "Blaze of Glory" -- 
his lifetime. Jackson employed the talents of a versatile 10-piece band to 
range from quasi-classical (his "Home Town" melody was set against an 
adaptation for horns and violin of Pachelbel's Canon in D) to biting rock ("I'm 
the Man") to jazzy jumpin' jive (a swinging encore medley). The horns in 
particular were used to provide sometimes Ellingtonian coloration to the songs 
much the same way Steely Dan used to employ brass, adding new dimensions to old 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
And within the set, especially the "Blaze of Glory" suites, Jackson ranged 
thematically from the New Frontier optimism of "Tomorrow's World" to the 
resigned frustration of "Evil Empire." 
</P>
<P>
Impressive indeed. While Jackson's no visionary (his music and especially his 
lyrics fall short of the kind of insightful abstractions that would qualify as 
poetic), the show left little doubt about his talents and ability to achieve 
his lofty artistic goals. 
</P>
<P>
But getting in the way of any real connection at each step was that dang 
attitude. Like Frank Zappa, another surly perfectionist, Jackson specializes in 
the put-down. On Monday, in one song after the other, Jackson aimed his snarly 
sneer at those he perceives as boobs: the ugly Americans of "Jet Set," the 
over-the-hill rocker -- performed by Jackson in a gravity defying pompadour 
wig, silver lame coat and bulging prosthetic belly -- of "Nineteen Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he threw a brief snit at a sound mixer and sparred occasionally 
-- and not always good-naturedly -- with the audience. OK, the guy who asked 
for the songs to be sped up deserved the "Why don't you go see the Ramones" 
comeback, and the nerd who got on stage and danced like a loon probably 
deserved more than the gentle kick in the derriere Jackson gave him. 
</P>
<P>
And even when he complimented the crowd for its enthusiasm, he felt the need to 
note that past L.A. audiences hadn't been so good. The only people about whom 
he had anything unreservedly nice to say were the members of his band. 
</P>
<P>
If he has no sympathy or patience for anyone else, why should we have any for 
him? Admiration? Without question. Appreciation for his accomplishments? 
Indubitably. But not much honest, deep feeling. 
</P>
<P>
So when at the end of "Blaze of Glory" he sang, "All I want to do is give you 
the human touch," you had to wonder where it was. 
</P>

GUATEMALA SEEN SLIPPING INTO A HAVEN FOR DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late in the afternoon of Aug. 1, a car carrying two men and a large green 
canvas suitcase was waved through security checkpoints directly onto the tarmac 
of La Aurora airport, where a commercial jet was being loaded for a flight to 
Miami. The men worked for the chief of Guatemala's anti-corruption office -- 
but the suitcase contained 55 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Acting with the assurance that comes naturally to high-level government 
officials, the men ordered the baggage crew to load the suitcase onto the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
However, a nearby airline official alerted members of an American-trained 
anti-drug unit stationed at the airport, who halted the loading, confiscated 
the cocaine and arrested one man. The other escaped. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it was a victory -- albeit a small one -- in the effort to 
prevent Guatemala from slipping into the morass of drug-related corruption and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very scary," said one foreign drug expert, who requested anonymity. "It 
wouldn't take much to buy some of these people (Guatemalan officials). It is 
something that could happen very easily." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Western diplomat added, "All the elements of Colombia are here: 
violence, instability, an alienated population, poverty." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the aftermath of the seizure indicates that Central America's largest 
country already is suffering from the narcotics rot that is engulfing Colombia, 
Peru, Bolivia and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
American and Guatemalan officials say well over 4,500 acres in the country's 
mountains and jungles are planted in amapola, as the poppies used to produce 
heroin are called here. That figure is twice last year's estimate and continues 
to grow so fast that opium production outstrips the production of marijuana, 
Guatemala's traditional drug crop. The American street value of 
Guatemalan-produced heroin ranges from $2 billion to $5 billion, experts 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"As it stands, 60% of the American demand for heroin could be supplied from 
here," one diplomat observed. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the home-grown production of opium, Guatemala is now a major 
transshipment point for South American-produced cocaine destined for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of cocaine is shipped through 
Guatemala, nearly all to the United States, according to foreign diplomats and 
drug experts. 
</P>
<P>
And while 4,000 kilos of the drug have been seized here this year by Guatemalan 
police and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, "obviously most get 
through," conceded one expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign drug experts say that until now, nearly all the production and shipment 
of Guatemalan cocaine have been controlled by the drug cartels operating out of 
the Colombian cities of Medellin and Cali. "The Colombians know where to invest 
money," one drug specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says, Guatemalans increasingly are getting into the business. 
</P>
<P>
The incident at La Aurora is cited as an example of that growth and as a 
measure of how high the resulting corruption has reached into the government. 
</P>
<P>
The man arrested was Jose Fernando Minero Navas, a close associate of Col. Hugo 
Francisco Moran Carranza, at the time director of the Administrative Control 
Department, President Vinicio Cerezo's anti-corruption office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moran told local journalists that the airport arrest would be 
investigated, he defended Minero Navas as "one of the most efficient employees 
of this office, and I give him total confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the investigation was stopped, and Moran resigned. But he remains a 
close associate of Cerezo, according to some sources. 
</P>
<P>
More alarming than the aborted investigation have been the actions taken 
against the Guatemalan police who carried out the arrest and seizure. One was 
shot and killed on the street, while the others received death threats and have 
gone into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the statistics, the seizures and the reputed involvement of ranking 
military and government officials in drug trafficking, some diplomats and 
others say corruption is still limited to individuals and has not yet infested 
national institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan military intelligence officers are described as working fully and 
closely with the local U.S. DEA office, a small, underfinanced operation of 
four Americans who have to cover Belize and El Salvador as well as Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done a lot of things here that couldn't have been done without 
(Guatemalan) military intelligence," said one source, adding, "Military police 
have been very cooperative and really do have an interest in getting to these 
people (drug traffickers)." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the signs indicate that the narcotics problem has reached serious 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
The same source who praised military intelligence and police cooperation said 
that "the army is very vulnerable to corruption, particularly zone commanders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Associate of Candidate 
</P>
<P>
One commander alleged by Guatemalan sources to be involved is Gen. Roberto 
Matta, a close associate of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the odds-on favorite to be 
elected president in next year's election and a protege of Gen. Hector 
Alejandro Gramajo, the army chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Although diplomats and drug enforcement experts consider Gramajo a major asset 
in the anti-drug effort, he is expected to support Matta as his successor as 
head of the military. 
</P>
<P>
Accusations of trafficking have even reached into the highest levels of 
government and politics. Cabrera is the subject of constant rumors and charges 
of involvement in the cocaine business. 
</P>
<P>
He denies the charges and says a DEA investigation has cleared him, but drug 
agency sources in Washington said Cabrera has not been investigated directly. 
When asked if the potential president was considered clean of any drug 
involvement, one source replied, "We haven't cleared him." 
</P>
<P>
Even diplomats who say there is no evidence that Cabrera is personally immersed 
in narcotic trafficking said that his image is poor. "He hangs around with 
known rotten apples," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
And while no one has produced evidence of any connection with cocaine 
trafficking, two Guatemalan police sources and other experts indicated that 
Cabrera used his authority to cover up the drug activity of one of his 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
One brother, Vinicio Cabrera, was convicted in 1984 of possession of 10 kilos 
of cocaine when arrested in January of that year at the Miami airport. Cabrera 
acknowledged Vinicio's guilt but says there is no truth to charges that another 
brother, Carlos, was involved in a June, 1988, plot to transship 54 kilos of 
cocaine from Panama to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign sources say Carlos Cabrera had given a man named Eric A. 
Ralda baggage claim checks to recover two suitcases containing the cocaine. 
Ralda was arrested when he tried to pick up the bags, which had been monitored 
on their flight from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Ralda confessed and implicated Carlos Cabrera, who also 
allegedly was seen by a witness standing on a balcony overlooking the baggage 
claim area when the suitcases arrived. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Ralda was released two days after his arrest, the 
investigation was canceled and Cerezo's aides deny the incident ever took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the apparent reason for the acceptance by otherwise uninvolved 
government and military officials was to shore up the increasingly unstable 
Cerezo administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport incident took place six weeks after the coup attempt," said one 
congressional deputy, referring to a May 9 attempt by some army units to 
overthrow the Cerezo regime. "There apparently was concern that an 
investigation into the brother of the foreign minister would destroy what 
little support existed for the government, so the investigation was called off 
and, for all intents and purposes, we pretend it didn't happen."

2.7% GROWTH IN QUARTER QUELLS RECESSION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's economy grew at a healthy annual rate of 2.7% in the spring, 
substantially faster than the 1.7% growth rate reported a month ago for the 
second quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The strong upward revision, which was largely expected by financial markets and 
economists, not only laid fears of recession to rest but it put within easy 
reach Administration forecasts of 2.9% growth for the whole year. 
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate was 3.7% for the first three months of 1989. For the 
first half of the year, the economy grew at an annual rate of about 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Commerce Department said in an associated report that after-tax 
corporate profits fell by a steep 6.4% from April through June for the second 
consecutive quarterly decline. That was a clear indication that businesses, 
especially in manufacturing, were unable to pass along labor and material cost 
increases, and it provided a worrisome signal of either future inflation or of 
a continued squeeze on industrial profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Economists greeted the revised economic growth estimate soberly. They noted 
that much of the improvement was caused by higher-than-expected consumer 
spending, a factor that may deter the Federal Reserve Board from any further 
steps to ease interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"This was almost entirely consumer spending, but we had begun to see that from 
the retail sales reports from late spring," said Bruce Steinberg of the Merrill 
Lynch investment house in New York. "The economy in late spring turned out to 
be a lot stronger than anybody expected, exactly at the time when the Fed was 
busily easing. Now, it's likely that the Fed will delay any further action for 
quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., 
called the revised economic growth rate "about what we expected, but with a lot 
more consumer spending than we first thought. There was also stronger 
investment, which is unambiguously good news. But the strong orientation toward 
consumption is not the preferred composition. It means the Fed will have a hard 
time easing any more." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Reaser, of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, added: "These numbers 
are no basis for further easing by the Fed." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Reaser said, First Interstate is still looking for a marked 
slowdown for the rest of 1989 -- 1% growth in the current quarter and a decline 
in economic activity in the year's final three months. 
</P>
<P>
The upside of that prediction, she said, is a belief that "inflation has peaked 
for the year and for this business cycle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Inflation Plateau 
</P>
<P>
Various inflation measures in Tuesday's report were essentially unchanged from 
the earlier report, suggesting that inflation has hit a plateau higher this 
year than last, but not drastically so. 
</P>
<P>
But some economists warned that more inflation is in the offing. The drop in 
corporate profits will probably force businesses to raise their prices later 
on, said Giulio Martini of the New York brokerage house of Sanford C. Bernstein 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"With two quarters of declining profits, you have the problem of a margin 
squeeze: They can't pass labor cost increases through," Martini said. "That 
means a building pressure for higher inflation next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's latest estimate of the economy in the second quarter 
pegged the total size of the nation's economic output at $4.134 trillion in 
annual terms. It said the economy grew by an annual rate of $27.2 billion in 
1982 dollars, compared with growth of $17.1 billion estimated a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $10.1 billion in new-found growth, a whopping $7.1 billion was accounted 
for by higher consumer spending. The Commerce Department said that consumer 
spending grew at a 2.2% rate in the second quarter, another sign that Americans 
still would rather spend than save. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's trade position, as reflected in the economic report, remained 
about the same as it had appeared a month earlier. The overall trade deficit, 
including financial transactions and services as well as trade in merchandise, 
improved at an annual rate of $2.5 billion, from $55 billion in the first three 
months of 1989 to $52.5 billion in the second three months.

GENERICS: ARE THEY AS GOOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Bruce French doubled over at the dinner table with a pain in his chest 
and was hospitalized with a blood clot in his lungs, he was surprised when his 
physician insisted that he take a brand-name blood-thinning drug instead of the 
generic version. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor told French that he was wary of the generic because of what he 
perceived to be a slight risk of unexpected side effects. He also advised 
French to change another drug he was on from the generic to the brand-name 
equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
"My bias and assumption, quite candidly, was that generics and brand names were 
in fact of the same consistent quality," said French, a law professor and 
generic drug advocate who for years had taken nothing but the lower-priced 
generics. "I was utterly amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Are generic drugs safe? 
</P>
<P>
The question facing French and millions of other Americans -- whether there are 
differences between generic and brand-name drugs -- is at the heart of an 
expanding federal investigation prompted by reports of corruption within the 
booming generic drug industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blood-Pressure Drug Doubted 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it will withdraw 
approval of the last remaining generic version of a leading blood-pressure 
drug, Dyazide. The agency said it is no longer certain that the generic is 
equivalent to the brand-name drug. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no evidence that even the generic drugs that have been 
challenged have caused any harm to patients. But some physicians and consumer 
activists say the revelations are rattling their confidence in generics and the 
way they are approved. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation appears to be a combination of some dishonesty and a lot 
of slipshod results," said Dr. Richard F. Corlin, a gastroenterologist 
practicing in Santa Monica. "It has heightened people's concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Generic drug industry officials say they are cooperating fully with the 
investigations, but they stand by the reliability of their products. And they 
insist that there have been no scientifically documented cases of patients 
being harmed by generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extraordinary Record' 
</P>
<P>
"We have an extraordinary record of safety and efficacy with generic drugs," 
said Jay Molishever of the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Assn., "despite 
intense scrutiny from 'the brands' who have been looking for a screw-up." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is much at stake in this battle. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. prescription drug market is valued at $30 billion annually. Until 
recently, it was almost exclusively the territory of brand-name manufacturers. 
But amid rising pressure to control health care costs, generic firms have 
cornered a larger and larger share. 
</P>
<P>
According to Molishever, about one-third of all prescriptions are filled with 
generic drugs. Approximately 30% of prescription drug revenues go to generic 
firms. Some analysts predict that that percentage will rise as high as 65% by 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA investigation presents "a heyday for the (brand-name) firms," said Max 
Stollman, who runs a pharmacy in Beverly Hills and favors generic drugs. "It 
couldn't have come at a better time or had more impact. They've been screaming 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Assn., which represents brand-name firms, has 
declined to comment on the FDA investigation, saying the inquiry is ongoing and 
no brand-name firms are involved. But the association has in the past expressed 
concerns that some of the generic copies approved by the FDA for marketing are 
not "therapeutically equivalent" to the so-called pioneer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, industry officials have questioned drugs for conditions 
including arrhythmia and drugs used for long-term maintenance. The industry 
association has called in the past for the generic drug approval process to be 
tightened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage Seen as Short Term 
</P>
<P>
Whether the federal scrutiny will put a crimp in the generic drug industry's 
growth will depend on whether patients have been harmed, some medical experts 
and financial analysts say. Others insist that economic pressures will ensure 
that any damage is short term. 
</P>
<P>
"The generic market is here to stay," said Arda Minocherhomjee, a health care 
analyst for the Chicago Corp., who predicted simply a shakeout of weaker 
generic firms. "The people who pay (health-care bills) cannot afford 
high-priced brand-name drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Scrutiny has focused on prescription drugs, although generic firms also make 
over-the-counter medications for headaches, colds and other common ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Under current U.S. law, prescription generics can be marketed only after the 
original drug's 17-year patent expires. The brand-name company has that amount 
of time to recoup its investment in research, development and marketing. Then 
generics can enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Generics tend to sell for less than the brand-name equivalent. The difference 
in price varies widely. For that reason, many insurers and third-party payers 
have created new rules and incentives encouraging patients and pharmacists to 
use generics. 
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 generic prescription products covering 170 drugs in different 
dosages and made by different manufacturers have been approved since 1970, 
according to Molishever. The FDA contends that there is no difference between 
those drugs and the originals they followed. 
</P>
<P>
But a key concern of some physicians and experts are provisions in the federal 
law under which the FDA approves generic drugs. Those rules generally require 
that generics be equivalent to the brand-name product -- within certain limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proof of Potency 
</P>
<P>
Generic drug companies must prove through studies that their drug is of the 
same potency as the brand-name version; that is, that both versions are 
absorbed into the blood and maintained at certain levels at comparable rates. 
</P>
<P>
But the FDA allows in most cases "variability" in potency of up to 20%. For 
example, the generic drug can remain in the bloodstream 20% longer or less long 
than the accepted standard, experts say. Whether that 20% margin is a problem 
may depend on the patient, the drug and your point of view, some doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this 20% acceptable? The answer is, with certain drugs yes, with others, 
absolutely not," contended Corlin, citing certain drugs for heart conditions 
and diabetes. "The only way you can know is to go through drug by drug by 
drug." 
</P>
<P>
But generic drug industry officials say that among drugs approved since 1984, 
the variability is on average just 3.5%. That level is comparable, they say, to 
the variability found from batch to batch and lot to lot among brand-name 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the industry officials say the FDA standards are stricter for 
drugs where small variations might make a difference. The agency allows only 
10% variability for drugs in which there is a small difference between a 
therapeutic and a toxic dose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (patients) can take generic drugs with confidence," Molishever said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recent months three former employees of the FDA's generic drug 
division have pleaded guilty to charges of taking thousands of dollars in 
illegal payments from drug manufacturers in exchange for speeding up approval 
of their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Two manufacturers have also admitted that they gave the FDA false information 
in order to win approvals. One company admitted handing in for laboratory 
scrutiny the original brand-name version of one drug rather than its generic 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Authority Asked 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the FDA is asking Congress for increased authority to punish 
wayward drug manufacturers. It also intends to intensify its surveillance of 
manufacturers and laboratories that conduct pre-market testing under contract 
to the firms. 
</P>
<P>
Generic drug industry officials and long-time proponents of generics emphasize 
that there is no evidence that any patients were harmed by the alleged 
corruption. Nevertheless, some physicians and others urge caution in the use of 
generics in certain instances. 
</P>
<P>
Robert T. Koda, an associate professor of pharmacy at USC School of Pharmacy, 
said any risks are likely to be greatest in the case of those drugs in which 
there is a relatively fine line between therapeutic benefit and harmful side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Koda cited anti-coagulants, such as the drug prescribed to Bruce 
French. Koda said it could theoretically be risky to switch a patient from the 
brand-name blood thinner to a generic in light of possible differences in 
potency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that the person might have a therapeutic failure," Koda said, 
"meaning their blood would coagulate faster . . . or the opposite could be true 
(and) they would suffer a bleeding episode. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to temper that with the actual data that seems to indicate that 
the number of therapeutic failures reported in the literature as a result of 
generic drugs is relatively small. Reports are not frequently seen." 
</P>
<P>
Corlin, the gastroenterologist, said he would be cautious in prescribing 
generic drugs for certain heart conditions and cases of diabetes that are 
especially difficult to control. By contrast, he would have no hesitation in 
using certain generics for colitis or ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
"In certain drugs, a 20% margin is not crucial," Corlin said. " . . . but if 
you have a person who is a difficult-to-control diabetic taking 20 units of 
insulin one morning, and they get 16 units one morning and 24 the next, that 
person is going to be in trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Molishever, contend that such cases are rare and the issue of 
variability is a red herring. Molishever contended that there have been 
anecdotal reports of unexpected side effects but not a single scientifically 
documented case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Cited 
</P>
<P>
Molishever also noted that an independent task force formed by the FDA in 1986 
to investigate the issue of so-called bioequivalence concluded in February, 
1988, that physicians could feel secure in substituting generic for brand-name 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The task force acknowledged that on occasion properly manufactured and 
administered drugs fail to have their intended effect. But they said it was 
extremely unlikely that in such cases another version, whether original or 
generic, would have a different effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Critics who theorize that one FDA standard might permit variations in potency 
that would permit one generic to be 80% of the original drug and another to be 
120% do not take into account all the criteria FDA uses," the agency wrote at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Stollman, the pharmacist, who estimated that as much as 50% of all 
prescriptions dispensed at his Family Pharmacy are generic drugs, suggested 
that much of the concern about generics on the part of patients is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the doctor, they have been brainwashed (by the brand-name industry) to 
think, 'It's my health. I want the best. I don't care what it costs,' " 
Stollman said. " . . . I think people need to have faith in their pharmacist. 
We're out to help them be sensible users."

<P>
Responding to an urgent appeal from Colombia's embattled justice minister, Bush 
Administration officials agreed Tuesday to consider increasing U.S. aid for 
that South American country's escalating war on the drug cartels, only days 
after a $65-million package of military assistance was offered. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials held new talks as Justice Minister Monica de Greiff, 
seemingly unruffled by the drug barons' threats to kill her and her 3-year-old 
son, asked for an additional $19 million to provide metal detectors, armored 
cars and other security equipment to protect judges from terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is under siege in Colombia, and we must protect it every way we can," 
De Greiff told a crowded news conference, shielded by extraordinary security, 
in which she broke her public silence during a visit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, vacationing in Maine, said his Administration wants to "cooperate with 
Colombia to the best of our ability." He said details of U.S. aid to Colombia 
are "being worked out." 
</P>
<P>
De Greiff, responding to persistent rumors that she is afraid to go back to 
Colombia and would seek refuge in the United States, said she has no intention 
of resigning and will return to Bogota next week after completing her talks 
with Justice and State Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I am determined that the integrity of our justice system survive this crisis, 
and I hope to play my full part in ensuring this," the 32-year-old Cabinet 
member said. "As a country and as individuals, we are under enormous pressure. 
Yet we have a job to do, and much rests on our success. 
</P>
<P>
"I never considered resigning," she added. "The threats are there . . . but I 
am satisfied with my protection right now." 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration chief John C. Lawn turned over his bulletproof 
limousine to De Greiff for her use while in the United States, a Justice 
Department source said. She is also being protected by a special team of deputy 
U.S. marshals. 
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department officials, De Greiff, who seemed relaxed and 
confident in her televised news conference Tuesday, was far more nervous during 
private meetings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
De Greiff said she would return to Bogota next Wednesday, making her stay 
extraordinarily long for an official visit. Her travel schedule means that she 
will be protected by U.S. security until after Bush makes his long-awaited drug 
policy speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the visit was so long, De Greiff said: "I presented a program today. 
(U.S. officials) have to study it. . . . I don't think one week is too much 
time. I think things are going very well right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional $19 Million 
</P>
<P>
De Greiff said the $19 million she had requested to protect judges and other 
Colombian officials was in addition to the $65 million that Bush promised 
Friday and to the $5 million that Congress appropriated last year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Colombian officials are still discussing the elements of the 
$65-million military aid package, but the first deliveries should begin this 
week, according to Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the equipment to be sent to Colombia includes aircraft, various 
types of weapons and ammunition, protective equipment, maintenance and 
ground-transport equipment, medical supplies, communications gear, spare parts 
and support equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials of both governments are now analyzing those lists to determine what 
is available, what is suitable, how much it will cost and any impact on U.S. 
(military) readiness by providing equipment," he told a Pentagon briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a television interview early Tuesday, ruled 
out any combat role for U.S. troops who will accompany the equipment to 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombians have not requested any American personnel for any combat 
mission," Cheney said. "We aren't sending any American personnel for any kind 
of a combat mission. These are people that will provide technical assistance 
and training, and that's all." 
</P>
<P>
De Greiff also ruled out any request for U.S. troops. "We have our own armed 
forces," she said, "and they are doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
She also said Colombia is not interested in a negotiated peace with the 
murderous Medellin cartel. The father of three leaders of the cartel suggested 
talks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been asking for negotiations for a long time now," De Greiff said. 
"President (Virgilio) Barco (Vargas) has said that this is not a moment for 
negotiations, that things have to be done the way the law says right now. So I 
don't think there are going to be any." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush met with members of his Cabinet and other top advisers to 
review final plans for his drug policy speech. 
</P>
<P>
Although the address is likely to concentrate on domestic anti-drug programs, 
the fighting in Colombia has caused Bush and his advisers to increase the 
international component of the package, National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft told reporters at a news conference in Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have been hoping for years that Colombia would get tough with 
its drug merchants, who are estimated to control about 80% of the cocaine 
traffic to the United States. But the sudden nature of the crackdown appears to 
have taken the Administration by surprise, requiring officials to do some 
last-minute scrambling to adjust Bush's anti-drug strategy to the new 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the strategy in place, then this Colombian thing comes up," Scowcroft 
said. Administration officials have been working to determine "how what we're 
doing now for Colombia fits into what we had planned to do," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his anti-drug package, Bush had planned to propose about $300 
million in additional aid to drug-producing countries, particularly Colombia, 
Peru and Bolivia. But, Scowcroft said, that figure has already been increased 
by the amount pledged last week to Colombia, and the amount is likely to grow 
further as U.S.-Colombian negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Justice Department persuaded a Senate committee to cancel a 
scheduled public hearing on the situation in Colombia because of concern that 
it might touch on sensitive matters that could endanger lives or damage the 
government's campaign against the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee was to have heard testimony today from 
Administration officials and academic experts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interested in Success 
</P>
<P>
"The concern was that once you started getting into questions at a public 
hearing, sensitive matters might be raised that could have an impact in 
Colombia," Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said. "I think it's in 
everybody's interest to see the current effort in Colombia to arrest people who 
are involved in the drug trade succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Department officials scaled back their estimates of when 
Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged money launderer for the Medellin cartel, 
would be turned over to U.S. authorities to face trial in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh had said he expected that Martinez 
would be extradited this week. But on Tuesday, Runkel said, "We hope it will be 
in the next week or two, but we just can't say for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Extradition proceedings under Barco's emergency decree are complicated, Runkel 
said, and "there may be a desire to have Colombia's Supreme Court rule" on the 
legality of the procedure before anyone is handed over.

BROWN INSURANCE LEGISLATION GAINS

Legislation that Assembly Speaker Willie Brown contends would provide 
affordable car insurance coverage for the poor as well as reduced rates for 
other drivers cleared its first Senate committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Senate Judiciary Committee removed from the bill a 
compromise no-fault provision that had been added in the Assembly in an effort 
to help secure passage. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the insurance industry strongly oppose the measure, saying 
it is an unworkable plan that would drive up the insurance rates of drivers 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, author of the bill, insists that the legislation would allow 
low-income drivers to buy insurance for $220 a year while saving the insurance 
industry millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Under the San Francisco Democrat's bill, motorists would be required to show 
proof of insurance when registering their vehicles, which would be subject to 
biennial safety inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill would give police officers the power to pull over drivers 
and issue tickets for violations of the seat belt law -- a provision Brown said 
would increase compliance with that law, save lives and reduce insurance costs. 
Under present law, police officers can enforce the seat belt law only when 
citing motorists for another violation. 
</P>
<P>
Brown predicted that his measure would result in lower insurance costs for all 
drivers except those who are now uninsured or receive insurance through the 
state's assigned-risk pool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promises Reduction 
</P>
<P>
"Every other person in the state will have a reduction," he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill has the support of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., a longtime 
antagonist of the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for the insurance industry argue that the plan does not provide the 
savings Brown claims and would lead to an increase in rates for most drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is being sold to California consumers as the answer to the high 
losses and escalating auto insurance rates that plague the state's drivers," 
protested David F. Snyder, a spokesman for the American Insurance Assn. 
"Nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor Uncommitted 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, Gov. George Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor has no 
position on the measure but members of his staff are working with Brown's 
office to produce legislation Deukmejian can support. 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee, 
where a hearing on it is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
"Some version of the bill will get out of our committee," predicted Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana), committee chairman. "But if it does not provide enough 
cost relief, then we will amend it make sure that it does."

COMPROMISE ON FAMILY PLANNING MAY BE NEAR 
</P>

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday that counties -- rather than the 
state -- may be asked to administer family planning programs under a compromise 
plan aimed at restoring $24 million vetoed from the programs by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said the governor wants to release the money in such a way that none 
of it would be used for abortion counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Democrat, who met later in the day with Deukmejian and other 
party leaders from the Assembly and Senate, also disclosed during a Capitol 
news conference that a compromise plan aimed at overhauling state solid waste 
disposal programs is coming together. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed after the 
meeting that the governor and key legislators "seem to be almost at the point 
of settlement" on a major plan to meet California's growing problem of solid 
waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations said there is general agreement on 
legislation to revamp the California Waste Management Board and set a goal that 
would require local governments to reduce garbage by 25%, in part by placing a 
greater emphasis on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders have been meeting with Deukmejian in an effort to negotiate 
agreements on family planning and solid waste disposal, as well as workers 
compensation system reform, health insurance and other issues before the 
Legislature adjourns for the year on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
As for family planning, Brown's comments confirmed reports circulating in the 
Capitol for several weeks that the governor and legislators had warmed up to 
the idea of allowing counties to disperse grants to finance family planning 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Abortion Counseling 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be some desire by the governor to restore the family planning 
funds, but to do it in such a way that none of the monies can be used for 
abortion counseling," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, was noncommittal. "The governor 
has indicated he is willing to discuss the subject of additional funds for 
family planning but he hasn't made any promises," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
The family planning programs, administered by nonprofit agencies such as 
Planned Parenthood, were set up to dispense birth control information. In 
recent years, they have been drawn into the fight over abortion. Critics 
contend that along with birth control information some agencies also provide 
abortion counseling. In some cases, critics say the money goes to agencies that 
also operate clinics that perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the programs help prevent unwanted pregnancies before women are 
faced with a decision on abortion. They also say the clinics provide poor women 
with an array of health services, including screening for cancer and sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the idea behind the proposed compromise is to turn a political hot 
potato over to counties. 
</P>
<P>
Counties in the past have opposed such proposals. But county officials now 
believe that taking responsibility for the programs may be the only way to save 
the $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
Larry E. Naake, director of the County Supervisors Assn. of California, said 
counties still believe that the state is best suited to administer the program. 
But Naake said his agency's executive committee decided Monday to accept 
responsibility for the program as long as the family planning funds come to 
counties with minimal strings attached. He said counties want to be free to 
decide which agencies will receive the family planning grants. 
</P>
<P>
On the question of solid waste disposal, Brown said there were only three major 
issues that remained to be resolved -- at least from the perspective of 
Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Identified 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker identified the issues as decisions on the composition of the 
proposed new solid waste management board, the levying of additional fees to 
finance the new program and who will have overall responsibility for the solid 
waste program. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a legislative task force composed of Republican and Democratic 
legislators has basically agreed to eliminate the current nine-member 
California Solid Waste Management Board, which lawmakers believe has been 
ineffective in dealing with the problem of solid waste disposal. The present 
board has been criticized for emphasizing landfills and incinerators for 
disposing of garbage, without placing enough importance on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, however, has talked about placing added emphasis on incineration, 
as long as it does not result in a net increase in air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
While lawmakers are talking about requiring local agencies to reduce the amount 
of waste by 25%, they are not yet considering a mandatory curbside recycling 
program that would force Californians to separate their garbage prior to 
collection. Deukmejian has said he would support requiring garbage separation. 
Legislators believe that the 25% reduction requirement, in effect, would 
require curbside recycling in many areas.

WATER POLLUTION BILL OKD BY PANEL

Legislation that would establish mandatory fines for coastal polluters cleared 
an Assembly committee Tuesday after the author made drastic last-minute changes 
to appease Los Angeles legislators on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Ways and Means Committee passed by a 13-6 vote a measure by Sen. 
Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) that would require local water quality control 
boards to impose fines on water polluters. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would mandate fines of at least $100 a day for the duration of a 
"harmful" spill and would require boards to publicly justify their actions if 
lower fines are levied. Spills resulting from unavoidable circumstances such as 
natural disasters would not be subject to fines. 
</P>
<P>
Current law sets only maximum fines against polluters. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is the result of my frustration with the regional water quality 
control boards not being tough enough, or not being tough at all. No penalties 
are being imposed at all in certain instances," said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said after the hearing that he reluctantly eliminated a controversial 
provision that would have mandated a minimum fine against polluters of $1 per 
gallon of spilled material. He said he made the change to win the votes of Los 
Angeles and San Diego Democrats who had been heavily lobbied to defeat the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The gallonage (issue) was made very significant due to the heavy lobbying 
effort by the sanitation districts," Hart said. "It is now less than half a 
loaf, unfortunately, because we were forced to reduce whatever deterrent we had 
by more than half." 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation groups, including the Los Angeles County sanitation bureau, and 
state oil industry lobbyists had strongly protested the per-gallon fine. They 
said such a penalty could potentially result in fines of hundreds of millions 
of dollars for spills that often are mostly water. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently one of our large agencies had an 8-million-gallon spill with little 
adverse impact," said Mike Dillon of the California Assn. of Sanitary Agencies. 
"If this bill had been in effect, the fine would have been $8 million." 
</P>
<P>
Several opponents contended that the present system of cleanups and fines works 
well and -- as one said -- "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." But Hart replied, 
"If you take a look at Santa Monica Bay and some of the problems we've had with 
sewage and pollution, you can see it is broke. We need to send a clear and 
strong message to the agencies that are involved in polluting." 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Assembly floor.

PARLIAMENT APPROVES ALL OF RAFSANJANI'S CHOICES;

<P>
IRAN HARD-LINERS LOSE AS CABINET OKD

<P>
Iran's centrist president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, on Tuesday won parliamentary 
approval of all 22 ministers in his new Cabinet, half of them new, despite 
opposition from a hard-line bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who has successfully confronted or outmaneuvered radical opponents 
in a series of political triumphs, got the ministers he wanted -- technocrats, 
political moderates and others who are committed to his top priority, restoring 
the war-battered economy of Iran. A sprinkling of hard-liners was included by 
the politically astute president. 
</P>
<P>
Never before under the Islamic Republic, founded by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini a decade ago, had an Iranian Cabinet been approved without exception. 
The closest to rejection in Tuesday's voting, which followed three days of 
sometimes sharp debate in the Majlis, or Parliament, was the nomination of 
Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Serajeddin Kazeruni, a holdover, who was 
approved by a vote of 145 to 97. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet has been more noteworthy for who was not named to it, primarily 
former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who led the political opposition 
to Rafsanjani even before Khomeini's death in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the 55-year-old president and the interior minister he dumped 
differed on the hostage crisis in Lebanon, with Rafsanjani assuming a far more 
moderate tone. Mohtashemi was instrumental in the formation of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, an umbrella group whose factions are accused of 
holding the 14 Western hostages, including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing his nominees as the debate started Sunday, the president gave 
the ousted Mohtashemi a backhanded compliment. 
</P>
<P>
"I am completely satisfied with Mohtashemi despite foreign media propaganda to 
the contrary. He is a close friend of mine," Rafsanjani remarked to the 
parliamentary deputies. However, he added, explaining his nomination of 
Abdullah Nouri to run the powerful ministry, "Under present conditions, I think 
Nouri is most fit and will act in a more planned way. . . . He is an organizer, 
a realist and a planner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liaison With Guards 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Nouri, like Mohtashemi a clergyman, was appointed by Khomeini 
as his personal representative to the Revolutionary Guards, the zealous, 
volunteer paramilitary corps dedicated to preserving the Islamic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stood firm in the face of criticism that many of his ministers are 
inexperienced or -- worse yet in the eyes of hard-liners -- foreign educated. 
</P>
<P>
As the debate closed Tuesday, he scolded the hard-line bloc. "If I didn't know 
you," Rafsanjani said, "my suspicion would arise that the aim was to paralyze 
the Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
Elevated to the senior Shiite Muslim rank of ayatollah with his election a 
month ago, Rafsanjani has taken control of a greatly strengthened presidency. 
The position previously carried influence that varied depending on who filled 
it. Administrative power lay in the hands of a prime minister, who directed the 
ministers. On the ballot with the presidency July 28 was a series of 
constitutional revisions, one of which eliminated the position of prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The last man to fill that post, Hussein Moussavi, lost his job when the ballot 
issue was approved, and Rafsanjani has not given him a new post. The two men 
were rivals for power when Rafsanjani was Speaker of Parliament, a position he 
turned into a seat of power with his smooth political manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary debate on Rafsanjani's choices was carried live on Tehran 
Radio, and speakers used the forum to send messages to the electorate. For 
instance, the new parliamentary Speaker, Mehdi Karrubi, a radical in the 
Iranian spectrum -- meaning a hard-line adherent of Khomeini's religiously 
fundamentalist, revolutionary and anti-Western policies -- endorsed the new 
ministers but warned that Parliament will watch their performance closely. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating hard-line rejection of his foreign-trained nominees, Rafsanjani 
began the debate Sunday by noting: "Studying at American universities was not 
and is not a negative point. Many (Iranians) who studied abroad have provided 
valuable services to this country." 
</P>
<P>
The American-trained men in the Cabinet include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finance Minister Mohsen Nourbakhsh, 41, an economics graduate of UC Davis 
and former governor of the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Iraj Fazel, 50, the new health minister and one-time education minister, 
who headed the medical team that operated on Khomeini's cancerous stomach just 
before the aged ayatollah's death. Fazel, a surgeon, took his medical training 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mohammed Ali Nafaji, 38, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, who retains the education portfolio.

An international conference on Cambodia will end today in failure, an official 
of the French Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, and a senior U.S. official 
predicted that this will probably mean months of renewed fighting in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too early to reach agreement," Jean Gueginou, the French official, said 
of the 19-nation conference convened here to work out a peace formula for 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the talks between the Vietnamese-backed government in 
Phnom Penh and three resistance factions will be resumed "perhaps in the 
spring, when (they) will have more chance of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
"The conference will end tomorrow, and it will end with a fairly brief 
communique," Gueginou said. "There was not, at this stage, the possibility of 
movement on the part of any of the Cambodian factions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Period of Testing 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they foresee "a period of military testing" as part of a 
power shakeout if Vietnamese occupation troops withdraw from Cambodia, as 
promised, by Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"After more than three weeks here in Paris," a U.S. official said, "we 
unfortunately do not see that we will be able to move from the battlefield to 
the political process." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who support proposals put forth by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a 
former national leader who now heads one of the resistance groups, blame the 
breakdown at the talks here on Vietnam and its Soviet supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the sense that the Soviets are really leaning on Hun Sen," the 
U.S. official said, referring to the premier of the Phnom Penh government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy, the official said, "is built around the idea of having Prince 
Sihanouk be the center, the focal point, of a national reconciliation 
government, a transitional political authority that would govern for a certain 
period of time until fair elections could be held." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether the United States might get involved in supplying 
any of the factions in the military struggle. The United States, he said, is 
"not interested in fueling another civil war." 
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that proposals in Congress would arm anti-Communist 
resistance forces. 
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that the fighting will be renewed and that "the 
realities on the ground will give people a clear sense of the real balance of 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk Faction Weak 
</P>
<P>
Others noted that the military forces of Sihanouk and the other non-Communist 
resistance faction are together weaker than the government and the third 
resistance group, the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
After a hopeful start, the conference quickly broke down on several key points, 
notably whether the Khmer Rouge are to take part in an interim government. 
Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to early 1979, a period 
in which more than 1 million people were killed or died of hunger and disease. 
The Khmer Rouge was driven from power when Vietnamese troops invaded in late 
1978 and Hanoi set up the present Phnom Penh regime. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk had proposed that the Khmer Rouge be included in the interim 
government but was opposed in this by Hun Sen, among others.

Japan's new prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, is scheduled to arrive in San 
Francisco today to begin a meandering North American tour aimed at generating 
positive feelings among an American public that has become increasingly 
irritable about a chronic $55-billion bilateral trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kaifu will have no new policy initiatives or trade concessions when he 
meets Friday with President Bush in Washington, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is hoping that Kaifu, at 58 one of the youngest prime 
ministers in postwar Japan, can inject freshness into the stale debate over 
U.S.-Japan economic friction and charm American critics with style and 
sincerity in lieu of concrete action.

"We expect Mr. Kaifu's personal traits -- young, energetic, accessible, caring 
-- will be well received by American friends," said Yukio Okamoto, director of 
the Foreign Ministry's First North American Division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Watch Red Sox Game 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Bush and a major speech at the National Press Club, 
Kaifu will go to Boston to watch part of a Red Sox baseball game and consult 
with prominent academicians, including former Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. 
Reischauer. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu also will travel to Mexico and Canada during his 10-day trip, which he 
undertakes barely three weeks after taking office in a climate of domestic 
political confusion. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been ravaged by 
financial and sexual scandals, and he is the third man to serve as prime 
minister this year, taking the post after his party suffered an electoral 
defeat in the upper house of Parliament last month. 
</P>
<P>
With the possibility that the ruling party will call a lower house election by 
the end of the year, Kaifu's status is anything but secure, and it remains 
uncertain whether he will serve merely as a caretaker until one of the party's 
major power brokers asserts control. Some pundits in Tokyo are calling Kaifu's 
North American tour a publicity stunt designed to bolster his image at home. 
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Ministry officials are treating Kaifu as though he is here to stay. 
Although they deny that his diplomatic debut is for domestic consumption, they 
acknowledge that his image suffers from a relative lack of experience in 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt whatsoever of the capabilities of Mr. Kaifu to carry out his 
agenda," Okamoto said. "His performance will erase any concern about him 
domestically." 
</P>
<P>
The substance of the prime minister's performance, however, may be difficult 
for American observers to evaluate. In his meeting with Bush, he is expected to 
dwell on benign topics such as cooperation with the United States in protecting 
the global environment. 
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the government is sticking to its familiar line that 
problems are caused basically by a lack of thorough understanding on the part 
of Americans of Japan's efforts to resolve the huge trade gap. Japan has moved 
to open markets and eliminate tariffs in a number of sectors, and U.S. imports 
are rising steadily, although Japanese exports to the United States are rising 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Issue 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly do not underestimate the intensity of feelings in the United 
States about our economic relationship," a ranking government official said, 
asking not to be identified by name. "The tenacity of the economic imbalance 
will take a long time to resolve. We have to live with it. Yet we cannot afford 
to have the continuation of our mutual misunderstandings confusing relations." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and Bush can also be expected to discuss the so-called Structural 
Impediments Initiative consultations getting under way in Tokyo next Monday. 
These talks will move the trade dialogue away from issues involving specific 
trade sectors and examine structural causes for the economic imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans think Japan's distribution system serves to exclude foreign 
products, while the Japanese think Americans are no longer serious about making 
products that can be exported. The American side will probably fault the 
Japanese for saving too much and spending too little on consumer goods, while 
the Japanese will respond with the argument that Americans spend too much and 
don't save enough.

<P>
The legislature of the Soviet republic of Moldavia, which is expected to defy 
the Kremlin and pass a controversial language law, met Tuesday amid spreading 
strikes by ethnic Russians who oppose the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
People in Kishinev, the republic's capital, clustered around portable radios on 
street corners to follow the live broadcast of the legislative proceedings and 
took part in an informal vigil in a square across from the Opera Theater, where 
the legislature was in session. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-independence popular front movements of the Baltic states of 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia announced that they will have a special joint 
meeting Thursday in the Latvian capital, Riga, to work out a common response to 
a tough warning issued Saturday by the Communist Party Central Committee, which 
labeled them dangerous extremists. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Popular Front, speaking out in advance of the meeting, denounced 
the Central Committee statement. It said in a statement published in the 
newspaper Izvestia that "the right to self-determination for the Baltic people 
is under threat." The declaration from Moscow, it said, was "incorrect and 
imperialistic." 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Soviet Foreign Ministry dismissed as baseless speculation 
that the Central Committee statement had been written by conservatives without 
approval from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is currently vacationing on 
the Black Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's statement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told 
a news conference in Moscow, "was worked out with the participation of all 
members of the Politburo, and this includes the general secretary of the 
Communist Party (Gorbachev)." 
</P>
<P>
In Moldavia, the president of the republic, Mircha I. Snegur, opened the debate 
in the legislature by urging quick approval of the proposed law. A vote was 
expected before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Gloomy' 
</P>
<P>
"The mood among Russians in the city is extremely gloomy," Yuri P. Tishenko, 
managing editor of the daily Sovietskaya Moldavia, said by telephone from 
Kishinev. "They expect this law will be passed, probably tomorrow (Wednesday)." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the office of the Moldavian Popular Front expressed elation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are following every minute of the debate and hoping for victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the legislature met, about 2,000 people gathered in the square across the 
street, some waving the red, blue and yellow flag of Moldavia as they waited to 
hear the outcome of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman at Popular Front headquarters said work in most offices had come 
to a standstill as people gathered around television sets and radios. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would make Moldavian, a Romanian dialect, the official 
language of the Soviet Union's smallest republic. It would also require a 
return to the Roman alphabet, by 1995, instead of the Cyrillic now in use. Use 
of Moldavian would be required in all state and business communications in the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Similar language laws were passed this year in the Baltic states, but 
consideration of the Moldavian law comes as the Kremlin has broken with its 
previous policy of tolerance and launched a campaign against growing 
nationalism in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda printed another article Tuesday lashing out at 
Moldavian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic intolerance," it said, "has now appeared in Moldavia, fueling 
bitterness, mutual hostility and suspicion among people of various 
nationalities." 
</P>
<P>
The strike by ethnic Russians in Moldavia spread Tuesday, according to editor 
Tishenko. He said work had stopped at more than 100 enterprises. President 
Snegur said 80,000 workers are on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Russians and other non-Moldavians, who make up about 35% of the 
republic's population of 4.2 million, consider the proposed legislation 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass, criticizing the proposed law, said, "Are the 
million and a half non-Moldavians who consider Moldavia their motherland not 
part of the people?"

Community leaders worked the streets Tuesday to defuse racial tensions that led 
to the arrest of 30 black and Latino youths in a rock-throwing protest over a 
white police officer's killing of a black suspected drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man's mother appealed for calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want nobody else's child to get hurt. I just want the kids to stay in 
their houses," Lucille Williams said outside her home. "I know my son is not an 
angel but I still think he should have had a chance just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel C. Williams, 26, was shot Sunday while swinging an iron reinforcing bar 
at a policeman. Officer Paul Letizia, a seven-year veteran, was trying to 
arrest Williams on warrants for assault, weapons violations, contempt of court 
and parole violations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Harry Curley announced at a news conference that there would be added 
police patrols, but he denied there was a racial problem in the city of 54,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of any racial tension in Vineland," Curley said. "This is the 
first time a police officer killed a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also set up telephone hot lines to combat rumors of additional 
violence and promised that a grand jury would be asked to decide if the 
shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the state Division of Civil Rights met with Curley and minority 
leaders to thwart a repeat of Tuesday's early morning violence and looting. But 
tensions still seethed on the streets of Vineland. 
</P>
<P>
"A white cop shot a black guy. It wasn't fair," said James Santalia, 14, as 
merchants along the city's main street cleaned up display windows broken in the 
violence.

SHUTTLE ATLANTIS IS ROLLED OUT, WILL LIFT VENUS-JUPITER PROBE

The space shuttle Atlantis was rolled to the launch pad Tuesday for a mission 
that is to send the plutonium-fueled Galileo spacecraft on a six-year flight to 
Venus and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
The rollout allows time to ready Atlantis for liftoff Oct. 12, said Conrad 
Nagel, who directs shuttle preparation. The liftoff date is the first of 43 
days in which Jupiter will be in a position to receive a probe from Earth in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
Five astronauts will deploy Galileo about six hours after the launching, 
starting it on a journey on which it is to fly past Venus, pass Earth twice and 
make the first close approach to an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
The circuitous, 2.4-million-mile route was chosen so that Galileo can use the 
gravitational pull of Venus and Earth to accelerate, in slingshot fashion, 
toward Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is to parachute a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and then spend about 
two years orbiting the planet, photographing it and taking measurements with 
scientific instruments. 
</P>
<P>
To power it through its long journey, Galileo will carry two 122-pound nuclear 
generators. Anti-nuclear groups have protested that the nuclear material could 
pose a hazard if it were released accidentally, although no protesters came to 
the rollout Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Galileo mission will continue the nation's renewal of planetary 
explorations after a 12-year hiatus that ended in May, when an Atlantis crew 
released the Magellan spacecraft, which is to orbit Venus in 1990.

BAR ON FOREIGN SALES OF BANNED PESTICIDES URGED; 
</P>
<P>
IMPORTED FOODS FOUND TO CONTAIN CHEMICALS THAT ARE ILLEGAL IN U.S. 
</P>

<P>
Traces of two pesticides banned in the United States have been found in 
imported coffee, carrots, pineapples, meat and other food products, showing 
that U.S. consumers are endangered by chemical companies' sales of such 
products overseas, the environmental group Greenpeace charged in a report 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If these products are too toxic to be used here, they are too toxic to be used 
anywhere," Sandra Marquardt, a Greenpeace activist, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The group criticized what it called a "circle of poison" that infects the food 
chain, from polar bears to dolphins, and asked Congress to prohibit the 
production for sale abroad of chemicals suspected of causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Imports Tested 
</P>
<P>
Because only 1% to 2% of all produce entering the United States is tested, the 
extent of contamination is unknown, Marquardt said. But last year, the report 
said, two shipments of Honduran beef totaling 40,000 pounds were found to 
contain eight times the allowable levels of chlordane and heptachlor, which are 
banned in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Contamination has also been found in some fruits, cheese and garbanzo beans. 
</P>
<P>
In some countries that import large quantities of food from nations in which 
U.S.-banned chemicals are commonly used, mother's milk has been found to 
contain 15 to 150 times the level of the pesticides allowed in cow's milk in 
the United States, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace singled out Velsicol Chemical Corp., the sole producer of chlordane 
and heptachlor, for criticism of its overseas marketing. The report said that 
the Chicago-based company has exported 5 million pounds of the pesticides to 
two dozen countries over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Defends Products 
</P>
<P>
Velsicol spokeswoman Donna Jennings responded that, although the chemicals have 
been banned in the United States because of health concerns, they are safe and 
pose no threat to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace is not basing their charges on science," she said. "It's garbage." 
</P>
<P>
But the environmental organization said that Congress will not be providing 
effective protection until it expands the chemical ban. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress must stop the production and sale of pesticides that cannot be sold 
in the U.S.," Marquardt said. "These products are showing up in our food." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 countries have banned or restricted the use of the pesticides, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
They are used commonly in Third World countries that do not monitor chemicals 
extensively and need economical pesticides to maximize their agricultural 
production, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency barred most agricultural uses of the 
chemicals in 1978 after studies of their potentially carcinogenic effects. In 
1988, the company halted all domestic sales under an agreement with the 
government.

The number of murders in the nation's capital this year passed the 300 mark 
Tuesday after a night of street violence fueled by drug warfare, District of 
Columbia police said. 
</P>
<P>
One man was stabbed to death Monday night, and two more died in shootings 
Tuesday morning, raising the 1989 city homicide toll to 301 victims. At least 
one of the three most recent killings was drug-related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten other people were injured in shootings or stabbings in the city during the 
night, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 301 homicides compare with 216 deaths at the same date last year, when the 
District of Columbia passed Detroit as America's murder capital on a per capita 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
There were a record 372 homicides in the city last year.

5 ACCUSED OF POSING AS OFFICERS IN HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five men suspected of posing as police officers in order to commit at least 
three residential robberies were arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident took place Monday morning at a home in the 2400 block 
of East 76th Street, where the suspects allegedly attempted to rob three 
residents and pistol-whipped a 31-year-old woman, according to Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner, who declined to identify the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Before they could collect any valuables, a Sheriff's Department parking 
control officer drove up and ticketed their pickup truck for being illegally 
parked," Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, believed to prey on Mexican nationals, immediately left the home 
when the officer drove away, Wehner said, but their victims noted that the 
truck's camper shell had the words, "One of a Kind," in colorful letters on its 
window. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies stopped the pickup in the unincorporated Firestone area of South Los 
Angeles on Tuesday and arrested four suspects: Joaquin Torres, 23; David 
Tolano, 19, Pablo Mendoza, 20, and Federico Quiroz, 29, all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the truck deputies found two handguns, two fake police badges, an "LAPD" 
baseball cap, a pair of handcuffs and two walkie-talkies, Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later went to a parking lot at 9th and Hope streets in downtown 
Los Angeles where they arrested the attendant, Eden Vargas, 42, of Montebello, 
and recovered a handgun stolen in the burglary of a Los Angeles police 
officer's home, Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
The five suspects are being held at the Firestone sheriff's substation in lieu 
of $500,000 bail on various charges, including suspicion of robbery and 
impersonating a police officer, the deputy said.

UC BERKELEY WILL BARGAIN WITH TEACHING ASSISTANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Berkeley has agreed to talk about pay and working conditions with an 
organization of teaching assistants and researchers in exchange for a promise 
that the graduate students will not repeat a strike that disrupted the campus 
for two days in May. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials stressed that the agreement is not formal recognition of the Assn. 
of Graduate Student Employees as a union. However, Berkeley graduate students 
say their group now has de facto bargaining status, a boost for the small but 
growing national movement against what they claim is their exploitation by 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very significant agreement and we think it's a direct result 
of the strike last May," association spokesman Michel Chaouli said Tuesday. "I 
think the university was somewhat dumbfounded by the strike and surprised by 
the breadth of it." 
</P>
<P>
Debora Harrington, UC Berkeley's manager of labor relations, denied that the 
campus was pressured by fear of another strike, saying the school was used to 
all sorts of disruptions. But she also said the agreement was a major step. 
</P>
<P>
"The university could have simply ignored or refused to deal with (the graduate 
student association)," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate students last year taught about 38% of all undergraduate courses at UC 
Berkeley. The more than 5,000 teaching assistants, graders and researchers 
worked an average of 20 hours a week and were paid a maximum of $1,100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached last week is to remain in effect as long as both sides 
believe that the talks are progressing or until the association's lawsuit 
seeking union status is resolved. A week before the May strike, the state 
Public Employment Relations Board voted to support UC's position that teaching 
assistants should be treated as scholars on stipends, not as unionized 
employees. The association, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers' 
District 65, is taking the case before the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was the first of its kind in California. Similar graduate student 
organizations have won bargaining status at only five other universities across 
the country, according to Mary Ann Massenburg, a UAW official. She said the 
union is trying to organize graduate students at four other UC campuses: 
Irvine, Santa Cruz, Davis and San Diego.

Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, "Roots" author Alex Haley and Albert Shanker, 
the president of the American Federation of Teachers, have been named to the 
advisory panel of Channel One, the controversial classroom TV news show. In a 
prepared statement, Shanker said he felt it important for his organization -- 
one of America's major teacher unions with more than 700,000 members -- to be 
involved in shaping the program. He added, however, that "I am not on this 
council as a promoter or endorser. I continue to have strong reservations."

Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, "Roots" author Alex Haley and Albert Shanker, 
the president of the American Federation of Teachers, have been named to the 
advisory panel of Channel One, the controversial classroom TV news show. In a 
prepared statement, Shanker said he felt it important for his organization -- 
one of America's major teacher unions with more than 700,000 members -- to be 
involved in shaping the program. He added, however, that "I am not on this 
council as a promoter or endorser. I continue to have strong reservations."

ARMY DRUG TESTING OF CIVILIANS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 7,000 civilian employees of the Army can be required to undergo random 
urine tests to detect drug use, a federal appeals court ruled. The 3-0 decision 
by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld most 
of a 1986 Army plan to ask some civilian employees to undergo drug tests. The 
ruling means that civilians who fly or service the Army's planes and 
helicopters, work in law enforcement or as drug counselors will be required to 
submit to urinalysis on a random basis. The plan would also require them to 
pass a drug test before being hired, if their supervisor had probable cause to 
suspect on-duty drug impairment or if they were involved in a mishap. But the 
court declined to uphold testing for workers with access to chemical or nuclear 
warfare agents, or for laboratory employees who conduct urinalysis tests for 
the drug and alcohol control program. The ruling was prompted by six lawsuits 
filed by the National Federation of Federal Employees and the American 
Federation of Government Employees.

The perception that air travel in the United States has become less safe is 
widespread, despite government statistics to the contrary, according to a 
Gallup Poll. Telephone interviews with 1,229 randomly selected adults Aug. 15 
to 18, a month after the crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, 
found nearly two-thirds (63%) of Americans saying they have lost confidence in 
the safety and efficiency of airlines in recent years. Almost half (45%) of 
Americans who travel by commercial airliner say they at least sometimes feel 
frightened when they fly. However, nearly three-fourths (73%) feel that even 
with recent safety problems, air travel is still basically safe compared with 
other means of transportation. The survey has an error rate of plus or minus 4 
percentage points.

The World Tourism Organization voted to shelve the issue of Palestinian 
membership until 1991. Delegates to the organization's general assembly in 
Paris approved by a 40-34 vote a U.S. motion to postpone any decision on the 
issue. Other members of the 107-member organization were either absent or 
abstained. There was no immediate reaction from Palestine Liberation 
Organization officials. Since the PLO declared a state of Palestine last 
November, publicly renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel, it has tried to 
gain entry to two other U.N. agencies -- the World Health Organization and the 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Both agencies also voted to 
shelve the requests.

Bell Atlantic workers in five Eastern states and Washington, D.C., returned to 
work after a 22-day strike and two subsidiaries of the "Baby Bell" serving the 
Midwest agreed on a tentative contract. Ameritech's Indiana Bell and Illinois 
Bell reached tentative agreement with the Communication Workers of America. 
They are the fourth and fifth of six units of Ameritech hit by a strike Aug. 12 
to settle. At NYNEX, which serves New York and most of New England, talks were 
to resume today in New York with the CWA and in Boston with the International

<P>
SAN DIEGANS FAVOR KEEPING WHALE SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite last week's death of a killer whale during a fight with another whale 
at Sea World, nearly two-thirds of San Diegans would like to see the park's 
whale shows continue, a Times poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-to-2 margin, San Diegans also said they approve of keeping killer whales 
in captivity for amusement shows such as the one at Sea World, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Conducted only six days after popular killer whale Kandu died as a result of 
injuries suffered when she attacked another female whale during a performance 
at the park, the poll found that the incident apparently has not dampened San 
Diegans' enthusiasm for the shows or caused them to seriously question the 
shows' propriety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favor Shows, Captivity 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of those polled said they believe that Sea World's killer 
whale shows should continue. Only 23% favor discontinuing them. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for their attitude about keeping killer whales in captivity to be used in 
amusement shows, San Diegans approved of the practice, 44% to 28%, with the 
remaining 28% being undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday of 860 people 
throughout San Diego County. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
With 72% of those surveyed saying that they have attended and enjoyed Sea 
World's whale shows, the poll suggests that Sea World has a reservoir of public 
support that perhaps helped to mitigate the impact of the publicity generated 
by Kandu's death. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've been to Sea World and liked the shows, you're probably more willing 
to look upon this as an unfortunate accident and not blame the park," said 
Times pollster I.A. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sea World officials, the poll's findings reflect the largely 
sympathetic public response that the park has received since Kandu died of 
hemorrhaging caused by a broken jaw sustained when she attacked Corky, a 
7,000-pound female who outweighed her by about 2,400 pounds. Since the Aug. 21 
accident, the park has received hundreds of telephone calls and letters, more 
than 80% of them positive, Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people understand that animals are animals, and that what happened was an 
accident," LeBlanc said. "We're pleased this shows that this hasn't affected 
the strong public support for what Sea World's doing in terms of education and 
research." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Dismayed 
</P>
<P>
Some animal-rights activists, however, were disturbed by the findings, which 
one Greenpeace official described as evidence of "a lack of consciousness on 
this issue." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frankly stunned by those numbers," said Julia Tracy, a member of 
Greenpeace's ocean ecology team. "It shows that most people aren't aware what 
captivity means to orcas, because they've never had the experience of seeing 
them swim for miles in the wild. A lot more thought and questioning needs to be 
given to that." 
</P>
<P>
But a top official of the Animal Protection Institute said that she was 
encouraged by the poll's finding on whether killer whales should be kept in 
captivity. While a sizable plurality of those respondents who have an opinion 
on the subject said they approve of the practice, 56% either disapproved or 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that to be tremendously encouraging," said Nancy Daves Hicks, the 
group's East Coast director. "If you had asked the same question 10 years ago, 
I doubt you'd have found that 28% were opposed and 28% undecided. To me, this 
suggests that people are beginning to question whether 6,000-pound animals 
should be kept in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ongoing Debate 
</P>
<P>
The comments from Sea World and the animal-rights groups capsulize a debate 
that began long before last week's fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, officials of marine theme parks argue that displaying killer 
whales in captivity educates people -- particularly youngsters -- about the 
animals and perhaps even inspires some to become advocates for the marine 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Some marine biologists and animal rights activists, however, contend that 
keeping the whales in captivity makes them more aggressive toward one another. 
</P>
<P>
"In nature, whales and other animals have the choice of either standing and 
fighting or running away," Hicks explained. "In captivity, they don't have that 
second option." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials, however, dispute that captivity played a role in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The poll revealed a gender gap in attitudes toward keeping killer whales in 
captivity, women feeling less favorably about it than men. While 51% of the men 
polled said they approve of the practice, only 36% of the women interviewed 
favor it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that difference, both sexes strongly favor the continuation of Sea 
World's whale shows, with 67% of the men and 64% of the women expressing 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CANDIDATES IN CLOSE RACE FOR PEPPER'S SEAT

A Republican hoping to become the first Cuban-American elected to Congress was 
in a tight race Tuesday with a Brooklyn-born Democrat to fill the late Claude 
Pepper's seat following an ethnically divisive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
GOP state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen faced attorney Gerald Richman, in his first 
run for elective office, in the election made necessary by Pepper's death May 
30 at age 88. Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat since its inception 27 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With 39 of 146 precincts reporting, Ros-Lehtinen had 8,716 votes, or 50.3%, to 
Richman's 8,622 votes, or 49.7%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tense Race 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-bloc campaigning dominated the short, tense race between Ros-Lehtinen, 
37, and Richman, 48, for the remaining 14 months of Pepper's term. Richman had 
come under fire for declaring: "This is an American seat." 
</P>
<P>
Elections officials predicted a turnout of about 43%, far higher than normal 
for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Richman, who is Jewish, hoped to capitalize on the 30,000-plus edge that 
Democrats, mostly blacks, Jews and retirees, hold in registration. 
Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Havana, looked to the Latino community, which 
makes up 40%-plus of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Polls in the final week of the race all indicated it was too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was heaviest Tuesday morning in Cuban-American precincts, where 
Ros-Lehtinen was strongest. Central Little Havana voted at a projected 77.3% 
clip. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, north Miami Beach condominium precincts, where Richman was said to 
have the advantage, were projected to have a 46.3% turnout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Controversial' 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very controversial election," Dade County Elections Supervisor 
David Leahy said. "There has been a tremendous amount of media exposure, and we 
think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote." 
</P>
<P>
The GOP hoped to add to its 10-8 majority in Florida's congressional 
delegation, while the state Democratic Party tried to erase its recent image of 
disunity and decline. 
</P>
<P>
Ros-Lehtinen refused to appear with Richman during the campaign, charging his 
"American seat" message was bigoted. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same charges were made against her campaign over a 
Spanish-language mailing that urged Latinos to show how American they were even 
though they were not born in Brooklyn and did not speak English like Richman. 
</P>
<P>
Richman said his "American seat" remark was an appeal to voters to decide on 
qualifications, not birthplace. He said it was a response to GOP National 
Chairman Lee Atwater's statement that the party wanted to elect a 
Cuban-American. 
</P>
<P>
Ros-Lehtinen, whose husband, Dexter Lehtinen, is U.S. attorney in Miami, 
portrayed herself as tough on crime and drugs. But Richman argued that her 
legislative record against gun control showed softness on crime, because it 
allowed criminals easy access to guns.

INFUSION OF NEW COACHES BRINGS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Blackburn of Alemany High has become an elder statesman of sorts among Del 
Rey League football coaches. Not bad for a 33-year-old coaching in a 
high-profile league that includes traditional powers Loyola and Crespi, both of 
which have been ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today during the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn might be considered a suitable role model for those greenhorn coaches 
who are new to the league this season. After all, he has already coached four 
league games. 
</P>
<P>
Only Steve Grady, who is entering his 14th season at Loyola, has more seniority 
than Blackburn, the coach at Montclair Prep for two seasons before coming to 
Alemany in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi, St. Francis and St. John Bosco will be coached by Tim Lins, Bill 
Garrison and Gabe Soumakian, respectively, all first-time head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Lins, 28, a Crespi assistant for five seasons, was hired earlier this year when 
Bill Redell resigned to devote more time to his job as an insurance salesman. 
Garrison, 32, a former Cal Poly San Luis Obispo assistant, takes over for Terry 
Terrazone, now an assistant at Glendale College. Soumakian, 33, left Loyola 
where he was an assistant for 14 years to fill the St. John Bosco position 
vacated by Bill Friedrich, now an assistant at Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
The new coaches have brought a fresh approach to their jobs. Lins, for 
instance, has taken a harder line on his players' appearance than Redell. No 
longer will Celts be allowed to sport Mohawk haircuts and wear bandannas or 
rags scrawled with slogans. 
</P>
<P>
Now, players have neatly cropped hair or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
Redell, who said his team put too much emphasis on its appearance last year, 
sees that change as welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably ran the program a little bit too much like I was in college or in 
the pros," he said. "They got more concerned about how they looked than how 
they played last year. We were a well-disciplined team but I think Tim might 
discipline them a little better." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Hunt, a senior lineman at Crespi, agrees. "Before the games you'd get guys 
sitting in front of the mirrors to see how they looked instead of thinking 
about the game," he said. "That's pretty much stopped. I like (Lins' 
discipline) better. I think it gets the team more prepared for the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lins of his disciplinary bent: "I think that discipline begins with the 
very first step you take on the field in terms of practice. We try to win our 
games on the practice field. I think (eccentric haircuts, bandannas, etc.) 
deter (you) from what you're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
It will take more than an iron fist to replace the services of graduated 
tailback Russell White, the state's all-time leading rusher (5,998 yards). Just 
two years after the Celts finished the 1986 season 13-1 and won the Southern 
Section Big Five Conference championship, they finished 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Grady says that Lins might be in a better position to put the team 
back in the black because, unlike Redell, he is a teacher at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the head coach has got to be on campus with as many assistants as he 
can have," said Grady, also an on-campus coach. "So the kids see that we're not 
all fire and brimstone. Then, they can be relaxed and work for you." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, few sophomores were willing to work for St. John Bosco coaches. 
And for good reason -- their primary role during the week was to play "scout 
offense" for the varsity defense. The impact on the program was profound. The 
Braves, who lost to Crespi in the 1986 Big Five Conference championship game, 
have won just one league game the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, it was a joke," Athletic Director Ed Riley said. "Tenth-graders 
were running the opponent's plays and they were getting the crap kicked out of 
them. Then they get to game night and they don't know their own plays." 
</P>
<P>
This year, after a pep talk by Soumakian, the sophomore roster has ballooned 
from 24 to 51 players. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three new coaches, Garrison might be faced with the most difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
Soumakian and Lins are familiar with league talent; Garrison is making a step 
down from coaching college players. To compensate, he already has broken down 
miles of game film. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says that his position could be advantageous. "I'm the new kid on the 
block and they've never seen the offenses my staff and I put together," said 
Garrison, whose team will open against Burroughs. "I'm sure the Burroughs' game 
tape is going to be a hot item. People want to see us and what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Grady says that continuity and harmony among a team's coach and his assistants 
is crucial to success, although reaching that point can be tedious and time 
consuming. 
</P>
<P>
"Our program has been so successful because we've had great coaching on all 
levels," said Grady, whose team finished 12-1 last season. "I've never had to 
have a complete turnover -- three guys leave and three new guys come in." 
</P>
<P>
Three games into Alemany's 1988 season, some Alemany backers were dusting off a 
space in the school's trophy case for the league championship plaque. After 
winning its first three, however, the team dropped six of seven. The trying 
experience provided Blackburn with valuable advice to impart to the league's 
new coaches. 
</P>

"After the first three games, I think everybody thought we were going to set 
the world on fire," Blackburn said, adding that he too was a bit taken with his 
team's early success. "When you're playing in the Del Rey League, you don't 
just walk into a job and take the league title. You've got to be realistic and 
work toward that."

DESERT-COASTAL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SEVERAL APPEAR WORTHY OF 1-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Football coaches in the Desert-Coastal League are either modest or using 
reverse psychology. But no one will admit that their team in the section's only 
1-A football league is ready to claim the championship. 
</P>
<P>
What it means is that there is no clear-cut favorite. Defending league champion 
Marian and runner-up Holtville will undoubtedly be near the top. But the No. 3 
and 4 teams are harder to predict. 
</P>
<P>
Of Holtville, Marian, Army-Navy and Mountain Empire, Imperial Coach Mike 
Swearingen says, "You could shake those four teams in a hat and pick one." 
</P>
<P>
Others would include Imperial in the list, although Swearingen says this is a 
rebuilding year for his Tigers, who have played in six league championship 
games, winning three titles and sharing one, over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last season, coaches and athletic directors discussed playing two 
rounds of playoffs instead of one, and some coaches have said they expected two 
to be played. But CIF Commissioner Kendall Webb said only one is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contenders: Marian (1-A champions, 7-4), Holtville (9-1), Army-Navy (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Imperial (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: Mountain Empire (2-8), Calipatria (0-10). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Holtville at Marian, Oct. 13. As the league opener for both 
teams, and Marian's homecoming, this could set the tone for the season. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The man: Holtville's strength is the arm of third-year starting quarterback 
Alex Wells. Last year as a junior, Wells threw for 1,700 yards and 27 
touchdowns, better than any returning quarterback in the state, and led 
Holtville to the 1-A championship game against Marian. As a sophomore, Wells 
threw for 1,400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing real well," Coach Sam Faulk said. "He's just where we want him." 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Tommy Provencia's shoes? Provencia, a wide receiver, was Wells' 
favorite target last season and a key to his success. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an outstanding ballplayer," Marian Coach John Pappas said. "We beat 
Holtville (for the league title) because we were able to stop him. We geared 
our defense around him." 
</P>
<P>
Senior David Amavisca played halfback the past two years, but with the addition 
of sophomore running back Mario Lizarraga (6-1, 175) and loss of Provencia, 
Amavisca will move to split end. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Imperial's third-year starter Leon Jackson, who has 
rushed for 1,658 yards in his career, returns as one of the top running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on defense: Senior John Baumgartner (5-feet-11, 185) was an 
all-league fullback last year but will also be a defensive key at starting 
inside linebacker for Army-Navy. Baumgartner has attracted attention from 
Brigham Young and San Diego State, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Marian defensive back Jamarr Brown is the player who, as a sophomore, stopped 
Holtville's Provencia in the championship game. Senior teammate Raul Souza is a 
returning all-league defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial is blessed with sophomore Gerardo Castillo, "a legitimate Division I 
punter," according to Swearingen. Castillo averaged punted 40.6 yards last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
First Aid: When 2-A or 3-A programs have been ailing, the 1-A league has 
sometimes acted as an infirmary. The unhealthy school limps into the 1-A, 
builds up strength, then returns to its old league. Three out of the past four 
years, the 1-A champion has been a former 2-A or 3-A school. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Marian, new to the 1-A this past season, will move to the 
newly formed 2-A Harbor League next year. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches have mixed opinions on schools being able to invade their league, but 
most agree it is to their teams' advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Most 1-A coaches don't like it. They come into our league, get fat and leave," 
Mountain Empire Coach Rick Abood said. "I look at it as we play a 2-A nonleague 
schedule every year anyway, so it doesn't affect us as much as the 1-A schools 
that play other league schools in their nonleague schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's Swearingen said that he sees the imported teams as helping preserve 
1-A competition, and since the schools have been honest about the reason they 
are coming in -- "to rebuild" -- he doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it enhances the league," Simmons said. "We played up to 2-A level. I 
like the competition, and hopefully it pays dividends." 
</P>
<P>
Pappas thinks the 1-A is the best place for his team because of Marian's 
enrollment but said he is looking forward to the 2-A challenge and hopes he 
doesn't regret the move. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 enemy -- depth: Mountain Empire and Imperial are in a bind as they try to 
field a team. Abood must bring up 10 players from the junior varsity to fill 
out Mountain Empire's varsity roster. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't lose 10 kids and replace them," Abood said. "It's really going to 
hurt us, and most of the kids have to go both ways. If we are really healthy, 
we could surprise some people and be a factor, but after this year, watch out, 
we'll be tough for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial lost its offensive and defensive lines and linebacking. 
</P>
<P>
"Of 22 kids, 13 are seniors, and of those seniors, a lot are inexperienced as 
starters," Swearingen said. "There are a couple kids who haven't played since 
Pop Warner." 
</P>
<P>
Paybacks due: There was a three-way tie for the No. 2 league playoff spot last 
year. A league ruling allowed the team that hadn't been to the playoffs in the 
longest time to earn the spot. Imperial had gone the previous year and 
Army-Navy in 1982, so Marian, the new kid on the block, made it. 
</P>
<P>
Army-Navy Coach Steve Simmons, whose team defeated Marian and only lost to 
Imperial by one point, says "paybacks are due". 
</P>
<P>
"We don't forget year to year," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Kings of the hill: Holtville surprised a lot of people last year by climbing 
out of the cellar and remaining undefeated until the championship game. Now, 
Sam Faulk said, his team is in a position it's not used to. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stressing that we can't let up. Everyone is gunning for us. We have a 
harder work ethic this year," Faulk said. 
</P>
<P>
Marian, also a long shot last year, must also adjust to their new-found status. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a small team, so I'm trying to get their mind set for the long road 
ahead," Pappas said. "People tend to come looking for the team on top. My kids 
are ready and have worked hard this summer."

JAMES FLANIGAN: NEXT STAGE OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enthusiasm for space exploration is rising once again. The pictures and 
accounts of Neptune and the ice volcanoes of its moon Triton inspired renewed 
support for space. And President Bush, on last month's anniversary of the 
Apollo moon landing, gave it focus by setting a long-term goal of a mission to 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The business of space is getting a boost also. On Sunday, McDonnell Douglas 
picked up a $50-million fee for the launch aboard its Delta rocket of a 
communications satellite for a commercial customer, British Satellite 
Broadcasting. McDonnell Douglas has orders for eight more launches and is 
bidding for a ninth in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
It is not alone in the business. Martin Marietta, whose big Titan rocket will 
launch two satellites at once in November, has orders for three more such dual 
launches and is negotiating for a fourth. General Dynamics has 28 launches 
backlogged for its Atlas rocket, 10 of them for a Navy project with Hughes 
Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
And small firms are very active, with sounding rockets that carry industrial 
experiments into the zero-gravity conditions of the suborbital atmosphere. 
American Rocket Co., Camarillo, will launch experiments for Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and the Strategic Defense Initiative on Sept. 20. Space 
Services Inc. of Houston -- former astronaut Deke Slayton's firm -- 
successfully sent up a rocket in March carrying eight experiments for the 
University of Alabama at Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gearing Up for 21st Century 
</P>
<P>
So are all systems go for a boom in space? Not quite. What is happening today 
is an industrial revival from the shutdown that followed the Challenger space 
shuttle disaster in 1986. U.S. rocket makers now see "an attractive, albeit 
thin, market," says Alan Lovelace, general manager of General Dynamics space 
systems division. But they recognize that today's full order books are the 
result of the backlog that developed in the Challenger aftermath, when nothing 
was launched, and that when things settle down, the orders will be only a 
trickle. Hughes Aircraft, the leading satellite maker with more than half the 
40 commercial satellites now in space, estimates about five launches a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today's renewed enthusiasm is important, helping U.S. industry to begin the 
real work of the next decade, which will be laying the groundwork of space 
platforms and communications systems for the wide-ranging exploration of space 
that is sure to come in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
And the revival is timely because competitors have been active. The European 
space consortium, Arianespace -- funded by 13 individual nations -- leads the 
world; it has put up 23 satellites in the past four years and has orders to 
launch almost four dozen more. China and the Soviet Union are offering launch 
services at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Japan has ambitious plans for space. In 1992, Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries will launch its H-2 rocket, and in the mid-1990s will put up 
the Japan Environmental Module, which is scheduled to accompany the U.S. space 
station. Beyond that, Japanese companies are being encouraged to think big by 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is holding a 
competition for ideas on space exploration in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite today's enthusiasm, U.S. industry may not have smooth 
sailing when Congress gets the $30-billion bill for the space station, 
scheduled for launch in 1995 and envisioned as both a center for experiments 
and a platform for planetary exploration. There will be cries that it's a 
boondoggle and that space isn't a real profit-making business anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not true. First, as the Europeans and Japanese understand, projects 
like the space station are needed to support the early stages of a new 
industry. And profit margins on space business are already good, says Donald 
Robinson, vice president of planning for American Rocket. American charges 
$800,000 a launch on small rockets and earns $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, space is a business with a considerable record of success. Today's 
commercial rocket launches are not the dawn of the space business but the 
second stage of a developing industry, says General Dynamics' Lovelace, a 
one-time NASA official. Communications satellites -- the first stage -- have 
been a business for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have launches, space-age trucking really. And the next stages, Lovelace 
says, will be in Earth remote sensing -- bringing to commercial business the 
work being done by spy satellites -- and weather control. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, today's enthusiasm is not misplaced. Space exploration has already 
brought us wonders that we take for granted -- the techniques of image 
enhancement for pictures from space have brought our hospitals computerized and 
magnetic resonance brain and body scanning. And while U.S. industry must now 
make up for some lost time, the advances of U.S. computer technology give 
America an edge in space for the decade ahead. What will be needed most in the 
1990s is to keep up the enthusiasm and the vision -- and that is suddenly 
easier to do thanks to the triumphal pictures from Neptune and Triton.

AMR CORP. SAID READYING PLAN TO THWART SUITORS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN AIRLINES' PARENT REPORTEDLY HIRES 2 WALL ST. FIRMS TO DEVELOP STRATEGY 
</P>

<P>
The parent of American Airlines, the non-Communist world's largest and most 
profitable carrier, was reported Tuesday to have taken the initial steps to 
fend off a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
AMR Corp. appeared to be showing concern that it would become the target of an 
unwanted suitor in the continuing airline takeover frenzy. This summer, airline 
stocks have surged anew as NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, has been 
bought out for $4.05 billion and UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, is 
currently under siege. 
</P>
<P>
AMR stock was the third-most-active issue Tuesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. A total of 3,873,400 shares changed hands, and the stock closed at 
$91.50, up $10.25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy Predictions 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based airline was reported to have hired two major Wall Street 
investment houses, Salomon Bros. and Goldman Sachs, to develop a defensive 
strategy to prevent such an attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley airline analyst Kevin Murphy said he spoke with AMR management 
officials who told him that the two firms had been hired on a "defensive basis" 
and that the company is investigating "potential transactions to realize its 
asset value." Murphy made his statement in an interview with the Dow Jones news 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts predicted in interviews Tuesday that AMR's strategy could range 
from the sale of one or more of its non-airline assets -- to pay shareholders a 
special dividend -- to paying out to stockholders some of the more than $1 
billion it holds in its corporate treasury. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines spokesman Jim Brown declined to comment on the reports. "We 
have been told by senior management not to say anything at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions varied widely Tuesday as to whether there is a real threat to AMR. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that American will be in play is if an investor announces that he 
has acquired a major position in the company and announces an intention to seek 
control of the firm," said Paul Karos, airline analyst with the First Boston 
Corp. investment firm in New York. "Then it will be in play. Till then, this is 
all speculation. The real question is whether all of this (stock trading) 
volume means that there is an investor group accumulating the stock for 
takeover purposes." 
</P>
<P>
But others say that it is only a matter of time before an offer is made for 
AMR. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Davis Said Not to Be Interested 
</P>
<P>
Based on the $120 a share paid for NWA and the $275 a share that Los Angeles 
billionaire Marvin Davis has offered for UAL, those observers estimated that 
AMR would be worth between $90 and $140 a share. A spokeswoman for Davis said 
Tuesday that he owns no shares of AMR and is not interested in pursuing the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be seriously disappointed if American is not being examined," said 
Edward Starkman, airline analyst with the Paine Webber financial firm in New 
York. "Given the way airlines are being traded and the way they are being 
valued (and) given the way that the NWA and UAL deals have been valued, I think 
AMR is smart to explore the options so that management can control its own fate 
rather than have someone else come in to stir the pot." 
</P>
<P>
Starkman said he believes that UAL could eventually be sold for $6 billion to 
$7 billion. Based on Tuesday's closing price, AMR would be valued at more than 
$4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst noted that UAL owns only half of its Apollo computer reservations 
system while AMR's Sabre system is still wholly owned by AMR. Half of Sabre, 
which has an estimated value of about $1.5 billion, is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hans J. Plickert, airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an affiliate 
of Paine Webber, said AMR might be developing a strategy to make itself less 
appealing as a takeover candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballooning for Weeks 
</P>
<P>
"If a company sells some of its assets, it becomes less desirable," he said. 
Plickert added that besides selling assets, AMR could borrow against some of 
its equipment, such as airplanes, to gain cash for payouts to shareholders. He 
estimated that the sale of half of Sabre alone would be worth about $25 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
The value of stock of all of the most highly regarded U.S. airlines has been 
ballooning for weeks, ever since NWA went into play. Delta Air Lines stock, for 
example, has climbed from $50 to about $80 in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like a bowling alley," Plickert said. "You pick up four (pins) and 
another topples over."

BRAZIL MAY ASK U.S. BANKS FOR DEBT LENIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Brazilian officials will meet with the country's leading bank lenders Sept. 7 
in New York in a bid to gain some leniency from creditors in advance of a big 
interest payment due next month, bankers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But with no agreement with the International Monetary Fund imminent and Latin 
America's most indebted nation vowing not to honor its debt liabilities until 
it can beef up its foreign exchange reserves, bankers hold little hope that 
September's $2.3-billion payment can be salvaged. The money is owed on $68 
billion in commercial bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's total debt is about $112 billion, several billion dollars more than 
that of Mexico, the next largest borrower. 
</P>
<P>
"The meeting next Thursday is expected to be informational," said one banker 
who will attend. "There is no proposal that we know of that they (Brazil) have 
ready." Other bankers said the meeting is likely to focus on Brazil's options 
for resuming payment of the interest owed on its debts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delayed Payments 
</P>
<P>
In July, citing concerns about a collapse of confidence in the economy, Brazil 
delayed payments to the Paris Club of Western creditor nations. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers said Brazil insists that without new loans to bolster its foreign 
reserves, it will be hard-pressed to resume interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
But there is only a slim chance at this time that banks would be willing to 
provide debt relief or new loans to a country that is not servicing its 
existing debt, one banker said. 
</P>
<P>
While Brazil is in talks with the IMF, it is barred from drawing the remaining 
$450 million from this year's $900-million standby loan until it has reached an 
economic understanding for the 1989-90 year, monetary sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far they haven't reached a plan," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
In Brasilia, Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's ambassador to Washington, said 
the country has a 50% chance of a provisional IMF accord within a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few differences over figures," Marques Moreira told reporters 
Monday night. "But there is a 50% chance" of a deal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A deadlock in talks with the IMF has blocked about $3 billion in loans: $800 
million from the fund itself and the rest from Japan, the World Bank and 
commercial creditors.

Davis Talks to Another United Union: Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis met 
with advisers to United Airlines' flight attendants union in an effort to win 
support for his $6.2-billion, or $275-a-share, bid for UAL Corp., the airline's 
parent. A spokesman for Davis described the meeting as "very constructive and 
cordial" and said Davis has no plans to seek labor concessions to finance a 
takeover. Davis met previously with advisers to United's pilots and machinists 
unions. Meanwhile, leaders of United's pilots union met with their advisers in 
New York to review their options, including joining UAL management in an 
employee buyout.

KELLOGG TO FIRE NEW SALVO IN OAT BRAN WAR; 
</P>
<P>
CEREAL GIANT'S SECOND NEW PRODUCT TO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kellogg Co. will put the crackle back into the oat bran war this morning when 
it introduces its new cereal Heartwise, a bran-and-psyllium breakfast food and 
its second new product in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Heartwise and Oatbake, which was introduced last Thursday, are an effort by the 
Battle Creek, Mich., cereal giant to work its way back into the nation's 
breakfast bowls and gain ground lost to General Mills Inc., maker of oat-based 
Cheerios and Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to oat bran, Benefit also contains a controversial grain called 
psyllium, which is grown in India and is high in soluble fiber. General Mills 
was the first to manufacture a bran-and-psyllium cereal, introducing Benefit 
last April. Kellogg became a quick No. 2 with Heartwise. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening here last week and this week is that Kellogg is positioning 
itself to benefit from the demand for oat-based products," said Harry Segalas, 
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "General Mills has been gaining 
share because they're very well positioned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Marketing Campaign 
</P>
<P>
The oat bran craze began about two years ago, with a diet book called "The 
Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" by Robert E. Kowalski, said Timothy S. Ramey, food 
industry analyst for County NatWest Securities USA in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the book had in there was that oat bran reduced cholesterol 
levels," Ramey said. "It had been substantiated a year earlier by a scientific 
study. This guy was the first to market the idea. Quaker then picked it up and 
started touting it." 
</P>
<P>
When "The Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" was published, General Mills already had 
an oat-based product on the market: that staple of early morning eating called 
Cheerios. In April, the company introduced Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
General Mills followed with an aggressive marketing campaign that touted the 
cereal's cholesterol-reducing properties, crediting soluble fiber-filled oat 
bran and psyllium. Studies have linked soluble fiber and a low-fat diet with 
reduced cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong demand for cholesterol reduction in the diet and a 
tremendous explosion in the oat bran cereals in the past two years, the last 12 
months in particular," said Lawrence Adelman, food analyst at Dean Witter 
Reynolds in New York. "An important part of cereal consumption in the last few 
years has been very dramatically driven by health considerations." 
</P>
<P>
It is just those considerations -- coupled with General Mills' market share -- 
that have driven Kellogg to double the number of oat-based cereals that it 
offers, industry watchers say. Oat-based cereals such as Benefit and Cheerios 
account for about 40% of General Mills' cereal volume, Adelman said, compared 
to only 10% for Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that General Mills is gaining some share and Kellogg has 
lost some share, a moderate shift," he said. "But Kellogg is coming back like 
gang busters." 
</P>
<P>
Until last Thursday, Kellogg's bit of the bran bonanza consisted of Common 
Sense Oat Bran and Cracklin' Oat Bran. Six days ago, the company introduced 
Oatbake, a whole oats cereal that can be eaten hot or cold, Ramey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FDA Developing Rules 
</P>
<P>
And this morning, Ramey said, Heartwise will burst upon the bran world during 
-- appropriately enough -- a breakfast news conference at New York's Waldorf 
Astoria Hotel. A Kellogg's spokesman would only confirm that company Chairman 
William E. LaMothe will introduce a new product and make a "major policy 
announcement." 
</P>
<P>
But before the announcement and the product introduction, "leading members of 
the scientific community, in the area of disease prevention . . . will discuss 
recent research findings on lowering blood cholesterol," according to a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills, said she knew nothing about 
Heartwise, except that it sounds a lot like her company's controversial cereal 
Benefit. Soon after Benefit was released, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. asked the 
Food and Drug Administration to pull the psyllium-based cereal from market 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FDA is developing a regulation governing health claims on product 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
Psyllium is also a part of Metamucil, Procter &amp; Gamble's fiber laxative. 
Procter &amp; Gamble had asked the FDA to allow the company to make 
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil, but the agency said more tests are 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble contends that Benefit is actually a drug and should meet 
drug-testing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald B. Hunninghake, director of the Heart Disease Prevention Clinic at 
the University of Minnesota, supervised the General Mills studies on its 
Benefit cereal. According to the study, a two-ounce serving of Benefit -- 
coupled with a low-fat diet, resulted in a 5.9% decrease in blood cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of how (oat bran and psyllium) lower cholesterol, I don't think 
scientifically we know for sure," Hunninghake said. 
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to see what they do for cereal sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market is enjoying phenomenal growth this year," 
Segalas said, who estimates that oat-bran cereals account for about $1.5 
billion of the $7-billion cereal industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume for the industry is at a 5% clip," he said. "The reason is that 
there's been a very strong demand for oat-based products. Historically this 
market has grown at a 3% to 4% annual rate. "

2 MAGAZINES' WAR EDITIONS LACK JAPANESE, GERMAN ADS 
</P>

Advertisements from Japanese and West German companies are almost entirely 
absent from recent issues of Time magazine and U.S. News &amp; World Report, 
which feature cover stories on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek magazine, whose special World War II coverage was limited to slightly 
more than two pages of book reviews in its Sept. 4 issue, had a normal amount 
of advertising from Japanese companies in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
West German companies do not advertise every week in any of the three news 
weeklies, so it was difficult to tell whether any had pulled ads because of the 
cover stories in Time and U.S. News. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Business 
</P>
<P>
But Time and U.S. News confirmed that some Japanese advertisers, which they did 
not identify, had pulled ads from their World War II issues, in some cases 
switching them to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The net of it was that we did lose some business," Time spokesman Brian Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to some of the Japanese companies that frequently advertise in the news 
weeklies -- including auto makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda -- were not 
immediately returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
News weeklies often notify advertisers when they plan articles that might 
embarrass them, such as a cover story on alcoholism that would spoil ads by 
liquor companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We make it very clear that the story is going to run in any case, and I think 
that speaks well for editorial integrity," Time's Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. News has a similar policy, spokeswoman Beth Kseniak said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. News has no ads from Japanese or West German companies in its Aug. 
28-Sept. 4 double issue featuring stories on World War II. Time's Aug. 28 issue 
on World War II carries a single Japanese ad, a two-page spread from Japan's 
Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese and West German advertisers are entirely absent from Time's Sept. 4 
issue, which has 17 pages about World War II and a small headline about the 
special section on the top of the cover. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek's Aug. 28 issue has 10 pages of advertising from Japanese companies 
and some small ads from West German companies, which are in an advertising 
supplement by the nation of Nigeria. Its Sept. 4 issue, which contains the 
World War II book reviews, has 10 pages of Japanese advertising. 
</P>
<P>
(A senior advertising manager for The Times said Tuesday that no Japanese or 
West German companies had withdrawn or delayed advertising in response to the 
paper's current series of Page 1 stories on World War II.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infiniti Ads 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen USA ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 issue of Time but did not have 
anything scheduled for the Aug. 28 issues of Time or U.S. News, regardless of 
the contents of those issues, said marketing director William Gelgota. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's Infiniti division, which is gearing up for the launch of its new 
luxury car, ran no ads in Time and U.S. News but had a four-page spread in the 
Aug. 28 Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
Honda's Acura division placed three-page ads in the Aug. 21 issues of Time and 
U.S. News but nothing in the World War II issues. It has a two-page ad in the 
Aug. 28 Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 Time and had the back cover of the Aug. 
21 U.S. News, but was absent from the World War II issues. 
</P>
<P>
World War II began Sept. 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and 
France declared war on Germany two days later. The United States entered the 
war after being attacked by Japan on Dec. 7, 1941.

KKR Partners Sued: A founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. sued his 
former partners, claiming that they enriched themselves at his expense. In a 
23-page complaint filed in New York Supreme Court, the state's trial-level 
court, Jerome Kohlberg Jr. alleges that Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts 
sharply cut his stake in several companies they had acquired jointly through 
the New York firm. "We believe he is wrong both as to the facts and his 
interpretation of the agreement between us, and we fully expect to prevail in 
court," a spokesman for Kravis and Roberts said. Kohlberg, 64, resigned in 1987 
from the firm he helped found in 1976, citing philosophical differences. He 
remained a limited partner, enabling him to continue as an investor in KKR 
deals.

DORFMAN'S 'SCOOPS' OFTEN DON'T PAN OUT, BUT FEW DOUBT HIS INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
USA TODAY COLUMNIST DEFENDS HIS SOURCES AND SAYS HE CHECKS OUT TIPS THOROUGHLY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock market investors who picked up a copy of USA Today on June 6 had a nice, 
fat tip waiting for them. Paramount Communications, reported the newspaper's 
financial columnist, Dan Dorfman, was "seriously weighing" a $175-a-share bid 
for Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman had the story down cold. Later that day Paramount announced a hostile 
offer for Time, at precisely $175 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later Dorfman did it again, breaking the news that Paramount would 
raise the ante on its stalled takeover to $200 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two great scoops," said Dorfman. "I live for that kind of thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman, 57, may have bagged those two, but he isn't always so prescient. More 
often than not, the tips and tidbits that he passes on in his USA Today column 
and in his frequent appearances on CNN's "Moneyline" TV show never quite pan 
out as reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scuttlebutt' and 'Gossip' 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps less remembered than his Time-Paramount scoops, for instance, was the 
Dorfman-reported speculation that Marvin Davis was considering buying Warner 
Communications, or columns that Donald J. Trump was thinking about taking over 
Caesar's World, MCA Inc. and Gillette Co. So far, none of this has happened. 
</P>
<P>
While those blind alleys were properly labeled "rumor," "gossip" or 
"scuttlebutt" by Dorfman, his news stories don't carry such qualifiers -- and 
can be just as speculative. 
</P>
<P>
In September Dorfman's front-page article in USA Today's Money section had 
raider Irwin L. Jacobs "seriously interested" in buying Greyhound Corp.; Jacobs 
never bid for it and disclaims an interest in doing so. Reebok International, 
Dorfman reported last March, was "in hush-hush talks to go private"; Reebok is 
still public. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Dorfman passed on the news that Mark IV Industries was "seriously 
intent" on buying Johnson Controls Inc.; Mark IV instead bought a large block 
of another company. Dorfman's takeover story, said a Johnson Controls employee 
last week, "just faded into never-never land." 
</P>
<P>
The erratic course of Dorfman's exclusives has done little to tarnish his 
status as the most prominent and influential financial journalist in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Influence 
</P>
<P>
The stocks of companies discussed prominently in his on-air work and bite-size 
news stories often move up or down on his mention alone. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month in an awesome display of Dorfman's power, Walt Disney Co. 
rose $6.37 the day before a Dorfman column on the company ran -- apparently on 
the basis of a small promotion box mentioning that Dorfman would discuss 
takeover speculation about the company the next day. When the column threw 
water on the notion of a Disney takeover, the company's shares fell $4.87. 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman, a compact, bushy-browed man whose voice retains the accent of his 
Brooklyn upbringing, professes indifference to his clout: "What a stock does 
after I write about it is not my concern." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Dorfman's dramatic influence and numerous wide-of-the-mark tips raise 
questions that aren't so easily waved off. In a business where rumor can have 
as much currency as fact, the role of the press is pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
An unscrupulous investment adviser hoping for a quick profit could feed 
information about a possible takeover to a member of the media, then sell out 
after the published tip -- whether accurate or not -- drives the stock's price 
up. 
</P>
<P>
This line of discussion predictably agitates Dorfman. Sitting in his quiet 
office above Madison Avenue last week, he placed the heel of his hand on his 
forehead and fired back at a questioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Window on Big Money 
</P>
<P>
His sources, he said, have been culled from his 30 years of experience 
reporting for publications ranging from Women's Wear Daily to New York magazine 
and the Wall Street Journal. His news tips, he said, are checked so thoroughly 
that he sometimes loses an exclusive because he is unable to properly confirm 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He is careful, he added, to call a rumor exactly that, and maintained, as does 
his USA Today editor, Tom Petruno, that his news stories have been accurate. "I 
am not a tout," Dorfman said. 
</P>
<P>
If he is being used by his sources, Dorfman argued, then it's a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm using the user," he said. "The average guy out there has got a right to 
every fact I can give him. Doesn't every guy have a right to know what the 
chosen few know? What is the average guy anyway, a leper?" 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman's stock and trade is to report that a well-heeled investor has 
purchased a small equity stake in a company, invariably one rumored as a 
takeover target. This information is valuable, he argued, because it provides a 
window "on what the big money is doing" before the investor must publicly 
disclose his holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dorfman said, "It's not my job to predict mergers and acquisitions," 
he will often describe the investor as a "raider" who is "seriously 
considering" launching a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the alleged takeovers often do not occur, but anticipation 
that they might frequently sends the stocks running up. Dorfman said this is 
not his concern, nor is it when stocks tumble back down when the "serious 
consideration" turns out otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jacobs Comments 
</P>
<P>
"Is it news when a big-name investor is dallying around in a stock?" Petruno 
asked. "I maintain that it is. Yeah, it doesn't always pan out, but the stories 
are written to say that someone "may' or "might' do something." 
</P>
<P>
The targets of Dorfman's stories say that it is impossible for him to make such 
observations based on any real knowledge. "I can tell you there is nobody that 
knows what I'm doing until I do it," said Irwin Jacobs, a frequent subject of 
Dorfman columns. "I've always had a real problem with speculation. If I'm not 
quoted as saying I'm going to do it, I surely wouldn't guarantee it's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Dorfman has reported that Jacobs-led takeover offers were 
imminent for Greyhound, CBI Industries, Avon Products and CML Group. Only the 
Avon report was solid. Meanwhile, Dorfman did not report Jacobs' moves on 
Tidewater Inc. and Shaklee Corp., or the leveraged buyout of the company Jacobs 
heads, Minstar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Some people believe the lack of access to a putative raider can leave Dorfman 
in the position of passing on information from second-hand sources who may not 
have as much insight as Dorfman implies. 
</P>
<P>
A Dorfman column last month about Campbell Soup Co. reported the possibility 
that friction within the controlling Dorrance family would lead it to sell off 
assets. The story had been making the rounds in the three months since the 
death of family patriarch John Dorrance Jr. and Dorfman added no new details to 
the old scuttlebutt. 
</P>
<P>
"It made it sound as if he was privy to all kinds of information," said Marcia 
Atcheson, Campbell's director of investor relations. "As far as I know there is 
no substance to any of that." Last week's restructuring announcement did not 
follow Dorfman's scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Dorfman's peers, while generally expressing admiration for him, wonder 
if the pressure to come up with big scoops can take its toll. "Dan is too smart 
to do anything that would violate ethical standards," said Gene Marcial, who 
writes the influential "Inside Wall Street" column at Business Week. "I think 
his biggest problem is to get the story from the right sources. He really tries 
to be as accurate as he can. But in the process he probably gets his share of 
bum stories." 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman dismisses criticism as merely the product of jealousy. He suggested 
that it has something to do with his fame and power, and his salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Workaholic Loner 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman won't confirm a figure except to say he has a five-year contract with 
USA Today, but it has been reported at $250,000 a year, plus additional income 
from CNN, which easily places him among the highest-paid financial reporters, 
if not the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of living the sybaritic life style that his income and position might 
entitle him to, Dorfman characterized his daily existence as that of a 
workaholic loner. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in a rented one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan; he recently traded up 
from a studio. He walks the 18 blocks to his office each morning, usually has a 
low-cholesterol lunch at his desk and has dinner with sources. 
</P>
<P>
With two jobs, he claims to put in an average work week of 75 hours. For 
relaxation, he likes to "get lost in some place where no one knows me." 
Divorced, the father of a grown daughter, Dorfman expressed a desire to remarry 
and raise another child. 
</P>
<P>
To those skeptical of his work, Dorfman allowed that a certain amount of 
skepticism is appropriate. "You're off your rocker if you trade just on the 
basis of what I or any other journalist reports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, that's not to say Dan Dorfman doesn't believe in Dan Dorfman. "I 
don't want to come off like a (expletive) braggart," he said, "but my point is, 
if I'm the highest paid, maybe I'm worth it."

DORFMAN'S 'EXPERTS' OFTEN PROVE TO BE FAR OFF THE MARK

"One sure thing is uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Headline on a Dan Dorfman column, Dec. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial journalist Dan Dorfman has a bit of advice about the advice offered 
by investment experts in his USA Today columns: "No one should buy stocks 
because of these people. You'd be out of your mind if you did." 
</P>
<P>
It's a worthwhile caveat to keep in mind next time you read what the "pros" 
quoted in Dorfman's column have to say. While hindsight is always 20-20, their 
investment advice has generally been wrong, especially in missing the Dow Jones 
index's rise from around 2,000 last September to its record high of 2,743.36 on 
Monday. Here is a sampling of comments from his column: 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 19: Dorfman, quoting unidentified sources, says New York Stock Exchange 
chief John Phelan has been telling friends he sees "no great shakes (ahead) for 
the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 28: A panel of experts predicts that stocks will fall 5% to 10% after a 
George Bush presidential election win. The Dow actually closes the year at 
2,168, up from 2,145 on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 7: Dorfman interviews a mutual fund manager who sees the Dow at 2,450 in 
six months, up 14%. In fact, the Dow hit and surpassed that level in May. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 21: Newsletter writer Stan Weinstein sees the Dow falling back to 1,700 to 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 30: Two investment experts say stocks and bonds will be bad investments in 
the new year, interest rates will be higher and inflation will be up. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 3: Dorfman, basing his analysis on another interview with Weinstein, says: 
"The U.S.A.'s 47-million stock market players face a crummy outlook over the 
next six months. At best the Dow will languish in the 2,100 to 2,300 range. 
Most stocks will go nowhere or down." A more likely scenario, Weinstein says, 
is that the Dow will tumble to 1,850 by the end of June and to 1,700 by the end 
of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 20: An analyst tells Dorfman, "We're looking at a dangerous, uncertain 
market," with the Dow falling 10% to 20% by year's end. The Dow is up about 400 
points since this date. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 27: Turning bullish, Dorfman writes: "A lot of folks expect higher stock 
prices, at least over the short-term run." 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 30: More bullish opinions: Stock market will go higher, two advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 10: Three experts see market going higher. 
</P>
<P>
March 27: Economist Irwin Kellner sees recession coming as early as the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
April 17: Experts see signs of improvement in stock market. 
</P>
<P>
May 1: Investment adviser Joe Granville, whose track record Dorfman describes 
as "a horror story," predicts that the Dow will hit 2,500 to 2,600 in one month 
and will top 2,722 in July. Granville is close: The Dow goes to 2,490 on June 1 
and hits a July high of 2,660. 
</P>
<P>
May 15: Harry Schultz, described as the world's highest-paid investment 
adviser, predicts that the Dow will top out in the 2,400 to 2,450 range and 
then begin to fall. Dorfman notes that given Schultz's disastrous track record 
of recent years, this could turn out to be "the super-bullish" prediction of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
June 16: Investment adviser John Tozzi sees a 10% market drop in one to three 
months. The Dow has risen 6.5% since then. 
</P>
<P>
June 30: Dorfman bashes Weinstein for his earlier bad advice, then lets him try 
again: "We're in for a July correction. Stocks have run up too far, too fast, 
and the market's very vulnerable." He sees a drop to perhaps between 2,250 to 
2,350. Actual range: 2,452 to 2,660. 
</P>
<P>
July 3: Dorfman's panel of experts offers three stock market scenarios: Stocks 
will be higher, stocks will be lower, stocks will be way lower. PAUL FARHI, The 
Washington Post

SOME DON'T MIND SECOND FIDDLE ON CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE M. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul White studied the stacked spines of names and titles meticulously. A grin 
spanned his face as he made a selection from the sea of sounds at the top of 
the rack. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this?" he asked, pointing to the Michael Jackson "Bad" compact disc he 
displayed in his right hand. "Over there, in the new section, this cut is 
$13.99. 
</P>
<P>
"The same, exact CD is $8.99 in this section," he said with a chuckle. "That's 
why I buy my CDs used. The extra five or six bucks I could save on this one 
could go to buying me another." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From $2.99 to $8.99 
</P>
<P>
It's a case of simple economics. While the price for the hottest, new compact 
discs now ranges from $13.99 to $17.99 and up, used CDs can cost from $2.99 to 
$8.99 at area shops. 
</P>
<P>
"CDs (also) don't scratch like records," said Gregory Neal at CD Banzai in West 
Los Angeles. "That's why you are seeing a lot of used-record buyers buying used 
CDs now. The condition of the CD is more likely to be in better shape than an 
album." 
</P>
<P>
Besides their inherent resistance to wear and tear, CDs also produce a 
remarkably clear, crisp sound; that sound-quality factor, combined with the 
prospect of lower prices, has helped create a burgeoning used disc market, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
While not an entirely new phenomenon -- record stores have been selling and 
buying used LPs since the dawn of the turntable -- the old idea applied in the 
high-tech CD Age still makes dollars and sense. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a large demand and supply for used CDs," said Rockaway Records 
manager Marty Levy. "Most people are aware of the discrepancy between the cost 
of an album and the cost of the disc and are looking for viable alternatives. 
Used disc buyers are the types that will buy a used CD for the price they would 
pay for a new LP." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it's not always possible for collectors to immediately find used 
copies of the latest, hot-selling discs; they may not find the range of 
selections in used sections that they might find by buying new; and they don't 
always get the advantages of the sleek packaging that accompanies some 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Hash, an assistant manager at Compact Discount in WestLos Angeles, 
sees other pluses, beside price, in buying used discs, which usually cost "only 
about 60% of the price of a new CD." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers of used CDs can, for example, "listen to the whole album" before their 
purchase, and, because the packaging seals are broken on used CDs, they can 
examine the discs' accompanying notes and paraphernalia, Hash said. At the 
store where he works, there are "three CD players hooked up" to let buyers 
scrutinize the quality of their pre-owned product. 
</P>
<P>
The used market, Hash said, is "just more convenient in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Just because a CD is used doesn't, however, automatically guarantee its price 
will fall. Rockaway Records carries used CDs costing up to $350. These special 
items include rare concert albums, other unique collectibles or higher-quality 
radio station recordings, said Rockaway Records manager Tom Phillipsen. 
</P>
<P>
Quality is important to the CD consumer, explains Paul Rock of Aaron's Records 
on Melrose. "I have seen people walk up to the counter and ask a lot of 
questions about our used CDs. They want to know about quality. When we let them 
listen to it, they can't believe they are getting that great a quality for the 
discount price. And they end up buying a lot more CDs." 
</P>
<P>
High turnover is what keeps most swap shops in business. Consumers walk in with 
their old CDs, trade them in, then end up buying a new set of tunes. To 
encourage this churn, Rockaway Records gives an additional 20% credit to CD 
buyers who sell their merchandise for store credit instead of cash; Compact 
Discount's trademark is to "buy six, get the seventh free," said Hash. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the reduction in CD prices already has spurred sales of 
players. Not that the devices aren't already hot. CD players, according to 
industry estimates, now are in more than 14.5 million American homes; they have 
increased sales from 1 million units in 1985 to an estimated 6.5 million by 
this year's end, with a projected increase of 2.1 million more players above 
that figure in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike three or four years ago, when classical music made up much of the CD 
market, compact discs now also can be found in abundance in the jazz, Top 40 
and rock categories. 
</P>
<P>
To potential customers, shops and savvy disc shoppers offer some simple advice 
about buying used CDs: Let your ears and eyes beware. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to the quality of the disc itself," Hash recommended. "Examine the 
playing side (the side opposite the label) for deep scratches, fingerprints and 
debris. Usually light fingerprints and debris can be wiped off with a dry 
cloth." 
</P>
<P>
To get the best bargains, experienced buyers like White also insist that 
shoppers must tune their routines to a fine art. White says he scouts stores 
often, seeking to find just the discs he wants at just the right time and price 
he wants them.

And, if he can't buy they immediately, he's not afraid to tuck them in less 
obvious display spots until he can return.

"I have my secret hiding place . . . these are half price. . . right here," 
White says, as he peers to his left, then to his right.

"I didn't expect to buy anything. I had left my checkbook at home," he later 
explained. "I hid (some discs) on the top row together and came back later to 
get them. They were still there. What a deal! With the money I saved, I can go 
out and buy $50 worth of groceries or something."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'CROSSFIRE' MISSES SHOT AT POLITICAL BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The noise from the TV set is CNN's "Crossfire," the live, brawling 
public-affairs series where guests are confronted by co-hosts advertised as 
representing opposite ends of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"From the right," it will continue to be Pat Buchanan. "From the left," it will 
now be . . . Michael Kinsley? 
</P>
<P>
So much for truth in labeling. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is "right," all right. And Kinsley is politically to Buchanan's left 
(who wouldn't be?). But thereafter, reality and the show's billing part. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsley, editor and columnist for The New Republic, has the face of a kid who 
buries himself in his chemistry set. Yet the bespectacled, scrawny-looking, 
38-year-old Kinsley is not only bright but cute and funny. And it's not that he 
can't be feisty, as evidenced by Monday's program when he and substitute 
right-wing host Robert Novak battled about a Capitol Hill political scandal 
with their guests, Democratic activist Anthony Podesta and Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Calif.), who could make a gutter-level shouting match out of "Swan 
Lake." 
</P>
<P>
But no wonder some special interest groups are furious about Kinsley being 
named this week to replace the recently fired Tom Braden as the show's liberal 
counterpart to arch-conservative Buchanan, who worked in the White House under 
both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
By his own description, Kinsley is "unreliably left wing." 
</P>
<P>
Not much of a liberal himself, Braden generally clung to the center position 
like someone hanging on to a log in the middle of the Pacific, often not 
opposing Buchanan's attempts to sink guests who were left of center. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'd have them both against me," occasional "Crossfire" guest Eleanor 
Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, said about the co-hosts Monday from 
her office in the Washington, D.C. area. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he tried to put up a fight on "Crossfire" (which airs weekdays at 
4:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.), Braden was a patsy for the bullying, keen-minded 
Buchanan and other conservatives who have filled in for Buchanan during the 
show's seven years on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Some "Crossfire" observers assumed that when CNN finally did decide to replace 
Braden, his successor would be someone as far left as Buchanan was right, and 
just as partisan. But as Kinsley acknowledged by phone Monday from Washington, 
where "Crossfire" originates: "Buchanan is much further to the right than I am 
to the left." 
</P>
<P>
The "Crossfire"/Kinsley issue isn't frivolous, for it reflects mainstream 
television's general reluctance to accommodate diverse political points of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Kinsley is a blow to liberal activists who had counted on a 
post-Braden "Crossfire" giving them a regular voice -- their only one -- on 
national TV. Liberals have argued for years -- with justification -- that 
public-affairs discussion shows range from those firmly in the political center 
to the far-right crowd of "The McLaughlin Group," Buchanan's own "The Capital 
Gang" on CNN and, in effect, "Crossfire." Hence, the perspective of the left is 
inevitably excluded, for panelists designated as liberals on these right-tilted 
shows are almost always centrists. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would cut the charade," Jeff Cohen, executive director of the 
self-described "progressive" media watchdog group Fairness &amp; Accuracy in 
Reporting, said Monday from New York. "It's a little like journalistic 
blackface, making these people come out and pretend they represent the left. 
And now representing the left, Michael Kinsley? I think it's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, so does Kinsley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that groups that complain that these political talk shows are tilted 
to the right have a point," said Kinsley, whose "TRB" column in The New 
Republic was once described by media critic Edwin Diamond as saving its 
"longest needles" for the left. "I'm not an advocate for the left the way Pat 
Buchanan is for the right," Kinsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological independence is an admirable quality in any commentator -- except 
on "Crossfire," whose hosts are cast as rigidly partisan ideologues, and whose 
conservative host, Buchanan, is just that. 
</P>
<P>
"Crossfire" executive producer Randy Douthit acknowledged from Washington that 
"some people" at CNN preferred Democratic political activist Mark Green, who, 
like Kinsley, had been an occasional substitute for Braden on the show. 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive advocate of left-liberal and Democratic Party causes and a former 
political candidate, Green is a forceful debater who proved a match for 
Buchanan in his appearances on "Crossfire." Others from the left could have 
filled that role too. 
</P>
<P>
Douthit denied a report that Buchanan himself had vetoed Green. "Green was my 
second choice," Douthit said. "I like the chemistry between Kinsley and 
Buchanan, and Michael has a little more wit than Mark." 
</P>
<P>
But does "cute and funny" counteract Buchanan's relentlessly hostile 
partisanship? 
</P>
<P>
There is more at stake here than left vs. right, moreover, for in choosing 
Kinsley, "Crossfire" also missed a chance to pick a minority member or a woman 
and thereby help diversify a genre of programs whose talking-head regulars are 
overwhelmingly white males as well as conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Buchanan is an activist against the progressive feminist view," Smeal 
said. At best, Kinsley will be "a more moderate voice," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"According to my contract, CNN can fire me at will," Kinsley said. "So if they 
think I'm not liberal enough, they can always get get rid of me." But the odds 
are long. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Crossfire" should at least get the labling right: Pat Buchanan from 
the far right and Michael Kinsley from slightly left of center.

WILDER TO SELL A TREASURE-TROVE OF ART; 
</P>
<P>
FILM DIRECTOR TO PLACE 94 WORKS ON THE AUCTION BLOCK NOV. 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film maker Billy Wilder is cashing in on his collection of contemporary art. 
The director of such movie favorites as "The Lost Weekend" and "Sunset 
Boulevard," nominated for 21 Academy Awards and winner of six Oscars, will put 
94 works of art on the block Nov. 13 at Christie's New York. 
</P>
<P>
Why is he selling? 
</P>
<P>
"The moment comes when you suddenly realize that friends who were collectors 
have died and the widow, the children and maybe a new husband are having all 
this fun during an auction. I want to be alive while that auction is going on. 
I want to get that kick," the 83-year-old collector said during an interview in 
his office in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's kick will come from a sale that is expected to total around $30 
million. The roster of works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, 
Georges Braque, Joseph Cornell and Fernando Botero includes many relatively 
small paintings and works on paper, but the quality is high -- as are estimated 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Picasso's "Head of a Woman" (1921), a masterful pastel portrait of the artist's 
first wife, Olga Koklova, carries the sale's top estimate of $5 million to $7 
million. Four other works are expected to bring between $1 million and $2 
million each: Miro's sprightly 1936 gouache "The Farmer and His Wife," and a 
1927 Miro oil, "L'Etoile"; Alberto Giacometti's 21-inch-tall bronze nude, 
"Standing Woman" (1953), and Balthus' "La Toilette," a 1957 oil depicting a 
pubescent nude girl standing beside a bed. 
</P>
<P>
What will Wilder do with his new-found millions? He answers with a Wilderesque 
anecdote: "A friend of mine who knew I was going to have an auction asked, 
'What are you going to do with all that money?' 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'I 'm going to buy a submarine and disappear.' Within two weeks, I 
got 20 letters saying, 'Boy do we have a submarine for you.' Everyboy wants to 
sell me a submarine." 
</P>
<P>
More than that Wilder won't tell, but he cheerfully shares stories about the 
renowned Hollywood collection that he has built over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
There's the tale about Russian author Vladimir Nabokov: "When he came to look 
at the collection, he was racing through the rooms and nothing, absolutely 
nothing caught his interest. But when Nabokov got to the bedroom and saw the 
big nude (clad only in white knee socks and red slippers), he grabbed my hand 
and said, 'Balthus.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Yes. How did you know?' He looked at me and suddenly 'Lolita' 
occurred to me, and I said, 'Never mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Monroe, the star of such Wilder films as "The Seven Year Itch" and 
"Some Like It Hot," was interested in only one work, a mobile by Alexander 
Calder, because she and Arthur Miller had lived next door to the sculptor in 
upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hollywood and art world personalities have visited Wilder's collection, 
first housed in a large home in Beverly Hills and more recently in a high-rise 
apartment on Wilshire Boulevard. "It's a marvelous collection," said Maurice 
Tuchman, senior curator of 20th-Century art at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. "Billy doesn't have a cookie-cutter collection. He's very much his own 
man. The work has a rather piquant, literary quality." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder has lived with art for so long that his decision to sell would seem 
traumatic, but he appears to have no second thoughts now that the art has been 
removed from his apartment. "To begin with, it was an absolutely wonderful 
sensation to see empty walls. I really kind of enjoyed it. But it's not going 
to last very long. I've got a whole new team sitting on the bench, and a third 
team after that," he said, referring to other collections that have been in 
storage. "There are many things I didn't put up for auction. I still have my 
French primitives, my Saul Steinbergs, my African collection, my pre-Columbian 
things, so you will never know that anything is missing. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, you do grow very fond of the things you collect," he continued. "I 
would like to know in whose houses they are going to wind up and I would like 
to give the buyers a little secret advice -- this one needs low light, this one 
needs a little more varnish, when the Schieles are reframed they should be 
mounted on acid-free ragboard. I hope the buyers will call me and say, 'What 
can you tell me about the Botero?' " 
</P>
<P>
No sooner did he mention Botero, the Colombian painter of bloated people, than 
Wilder was off on another story -- this one about "Lady in the Tub." The 1978 
painting of a puffed-up nude in a pink bathroom presents the woman from the 
back as she observes her round face in a hand mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"When they took that Botero away, I looked at it and said, 'My God, what a 
waste. Giacometti could have made three (emaciated figures) with that and -- 
here comes the topper -- there still would have been enough left over for one 
small William Morris agent.' " 
</P>
<P>
Botero is only one of many artists whom Wilder has bought in quantity. "When my 
interest latches on to somebody I pursue it," he said. "That is the whole 
problem. In order to keep what I have, to keep it on this level, I would have 
to add something or it's a dead collection. But I just very simply cannot buy 
anything in that class because over the last 20 years, two zeros have been 
added to the prices." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, who was born in 1906 in Austria, never had vast amounts of money to 
spend on art. "I started in Germany in the late '20s and early '30s as I 
suppose everybody does, with Toulouse-Lautrec posters," he said. "But 
everything had to be given away, because I had to make up my mind in 20 minutes 
to get the hell out of Berlin (in 1933). I took the night train to Paris, where 
it was a struggle to feed myself and pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
His fortunes began to rise in 1934, when he moved to America. "Whatever I made, 
$200 or $300 a week, I always put half or a third into a drawer for art 
purchases. My good luck was in all those years I never bought racing horses, I 
never had a yacht, I never bought a Ferrari. I have no villa in St. Tropez. I 
cut down on my ballooning in Bavaria and I stayed away from junk bonds. I just 
buy nice things and sometimes swap them for better ones. I've been rather lucky 
in that. I bought most of the stuff a couple of weeks ahead of the big prices," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's still at it. His modest office in Beverly Hills has lovely drawings by 
David Hockney tucked away in spaces between a vast library and movie trophies. 
His most recent purchases, three works in Zuka's recreation of the French 
Revolution that recently appeared at Otis/Parsons art gallery, are still on the 
road in a traveling show -- and it's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't have to worry about where to hang them for awhile," he said. "For the 
first 30 years of marriage, my wife, God bless her, asked me, 'Where are you 
going to put it?' The answer always was -- and it finally penetrated -- 'I 
don't know, but I want to have it.' Sometimes I would drive around with a 
Picasso drawing or a little Henry Moore sculpture in the trunk of my car and I 
would have to smuggle it into the house. When I had four Moores, she didn't 
notice that suddenly there were five. That was the trick." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder has bought art all around the world from dealers such as Curt Valentin, 
Sidney Janis, Frank Perls and Heinz Berggruen. He generally buys established 
artists for his own collection, but he delights in supporting unknown artists 
-- sometimes buying their work and spreading the word by giving it to friends. 
"I love to help new talent. That's one of the joys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What about helping the museums that are currently suffering from the high price 
of art and tax laws that discourage donations? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Getty or a Thyssen. My stuff is good, but it is not quite up to the 
level of a really first-class museum. They are only going to use it as cash and 
I think that is very unfair," Wilder said. "I do not donate because the great 
museums are going to use my art only for deaccessioning (a standard museum 
practice of selling pieces from the permanent collection to finance other 
acquisitions). 
</P>
<P>
"Of the six pieces I gave to the County Museum of Art, only two are now in the 
permanent collection," he continued. Citing an instance when he feels he got 
burned, he said the only notice he had of LACMA's sale of one of his donated 
pieces was in the museum's monthly magazine, which noted the acquisition of a 
Dutch engraving, purchased with Wilder funds. "When you have a deaccession, 
don't you think you should tell the former owner so that he can bid on it and 
buy it back? That made me very, very angry and I hold it against them," he 
said. (Earl A. Powell, director of the museum, was on vacation and unavailable 
for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
Another problem Wilder has with museums is that they "stash things away" in 
storage. "When you give to a museum, you want other people to partake in your 
joy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder brightened quickly at the prospect of the auction. "It's going to be 
very, very interesting as to where I'm going from here," he said. The first 
step is a round of exhibitions of his collection, available for public viewing 
Sept. 26, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., in the Crystal Ballroom of the Beverly Hills 
Hotel. The show will travel on to Toyko, Paris, Zurich and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes Christie's sale Nov. 13. "I will take my friends to dinner after the 
auction," Wilder said. "If it's a flop they'll have Coca-Cola, but it's going 
to be all right. I would like to see nice people enjoy the art the way I have 
for 50 years."

UCI IS SUPPORTED FOR REJECTING BID THAT WAS 1 SECOND LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UC hearing officer has upheld a controversial decision in which UC Irvine 
administrators rejected the lowest bid for construction of a 
multimillion-dollar cancer building because it was one second late. 
</P>
<P>
Don McIntyre, attorney for Taylor Woodrow Construction in Irvine, said the 
decision will cost California taxpayers $149,000 per second -- the amount they 
would have saved had the Taylor Woodrow bid been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ironic," he said. UCI Medical Center, McIntyre said, is faced 
with millions of dollars in deficits each year, "and on the other hand we get a 
result like this." 
</P>
<P>
After a daylong hearing on the contract process earlier this month, UC hearing 
officer James J. Putkey concluded Monday that Taylor Woodrow was responsible 
for meeting UCI's bidding deadline June 8 at precisely 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Taylor Woodrow's bid was irregular because it was late," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victor Is Pleased 
</P>
<P>
Putkey also said the Taylor Woodrow bid did not comply with UCI bidding 
requirements because, although its representative may have entered the room 
where UCI officials were accepting bids by 2 p.m., "the bid was not deposited 
at the front desk" in that room on time, as bidding documents specified. 
</P>
<P>
Further, had the late bid been accepted, Taylor Woodrow would have had an 
unfair advantage over other bidders because the firm "had more time to receive 
lower subcontractor bids and thus present a lower bid to the university," 
Putkey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bernards Brothers Inc., a San Fernando construction firm, won the contract over 
three others with a bid of $8.65 million. Taylor Woodrow and Moran Construction 
of Alhambra submitted lower bids, but those firms bids were not even opened 
because UCI officials said both were one second late. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow bid $8.5 million on the project, and Moran Construction bid 
$8.53 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Bernards' applauded Putkey's decision Tuesday. "It's customary 
for bids to be rejected if they're late, whether it's one second, one minute or 
one hour," said Ted Gropman, a construction law attorney representing Bernards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Long Story' 
</P>
<P>
Meredith Cefali, the UCI contract administrator who handled the bidding, 
declined to comment on Putkey's decision and on whether any UCI bidding 
procedures have changed because of the dispute. "It's a long story," she said. 
"I'm not going to go into it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Charles Glidden, vice president of Moran, which had protested UCI's 
bid process but did not appeal, conceded: "Our representative was wrong. He 
should have had the bid in" at precisely 2 p.m. Still, Glidden said: "One 
second -- that's pretty picky. And it's going to cost the state or the taxpayer 
a considerable amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow officials said Tuesday that they will probably appeal the 
hearing officer's decision in court. Still, project executive Chris G. Elliott 
called the situation an unusual example of "bureaucratic stubbornness." 
</P>
<P>
According to some of the bidders and their attorneys, UCI administrator Cefali 
had on June 8 assembled a half-dozen bidders for the cancer building contract 
in a row of offices along a hall on the Irvine campus. Each contractor's 
representative had a telephone so that he could talk to officials in his 
company's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arcane Process 
</P>
<P>
According to those familiar with the process, the public contract bidding 
process is an arcane and frenetic one. In the space of a few hours, officials 
in a construction company's headquarters get quotes from subcontractors, figure 
out their costs and profit margins, then telephone the total to a "bid runner," 
who races with the formal bid to the office where it is to be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
The pace is frantic because "bids are compiled at the last possible moment" so 
that competing contractors will have less opportunity to "shop" subcontractor's 
bids -- that is, ask one subcontractor to beat another's price, said Taylor 
Woodrow attorney McIntrye. 
</P>
<P>
This was the process used by the prospective contractors for UCI on June 8. But 
according to hearing officer Putkey, shortly before the 2 p.m. deadline, Cefali 
had received no bids and had asked another UCI official to go down the hall and 
give bidders a one-minute warning. According to Putkey's report, the Taylor 
Woodrow bid runner heard the warning, immediately sealed his bid and delivered 
it to the bid room. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the Taylor Woodrow officials contend, the procedure became 
unfair. They contend their office was farthest down the hall from where the 
bids were to be submitted, so that when a UCI official told them they had one 
minute left, they were "misled" and that they actually had less time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Cefali was using as an official clock a telephone recording of the time that 
was broadcast to bidders on a speaker phone. After sounding the 2 p.m. 
recording of the time, Cefali hung up the telephone receiver. And, according to 
Putkey, "immediately after the receiver was hung up, Taylor Woodrow's runner 
deposited the bid in the bid deposit box on the front desk" and Cefali rejected 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In the Room' 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre contends that the bid should have been accepted because "physically 
our people were there in the room. There was a sweep-hand clock on the wall. 
And they went to hand the bid to Ms. Cefali, and she said, 'What's this?' They 
said, 'This is our bid.' And she said, 'Well, you're late. Well, you're one 
second late.' " 
</P>
<P>
McIntrye said he thinks UCI officials could easily end the dispute by 
admitting, " 'Let's say this is a mistake; let's get on with business rather 
than spend $149,000 that need not be spent.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bernards officials say the contract was properly awarded, and Putkey agreed.

MAN WHO SET SON ON FIRE INVESTIGATED IN THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State prison officials are investigating reports that Charles David Rothenberg, 
who poured kerosene over his 6-year-old son and set him on fire in 1983, 
threatened to kill his ex-wife and her new husband and to kidnap his son after 
his scheduled release in December. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators in the state Department of Corrections received information about 
two weeks ago that Rothenberg, who is serving a 13-year sentence for the attack 
on his son, made threatening statements in a letter to his former wife, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, who prosecuted Rothenberg in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef said Tuesday that he would review the findings of the investigators and 
determine whether charges should be filed against Rothenberg, whose near-fatal 
attack inflicted third-degree burns over 85% of David Rothenberg's body. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be looking at them (the investigators' findings) and seeing what 
validity, if any, there is to them," Avdeef said. "I'm very interested in the 
alleged threats." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father confessed that he set his son afire in a Buena Park motel room 
because he feared that his ex-wife, who had custody of the boy, would never let 
him see the child again. He said he intended to kill himself along with his 
son, but panicked and fled at the last second. 
</P>
<P>
If officials determine that Rothenberg made the threats, his scheduled December 
parole from the California Medical Facility at Vacaville could be delayed. 
Rothenberg was transferred to Vacaville from the state prison at Soledad in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
State corrections officials were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef said he had few details about the contents of the purported letter and 
did not know if it was actually mailed to Rothenberg's former wife, Marie, who 
has since married a police lieutenant. But he added, "The threats came to her 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claim by Inmate 
</P>
<P>
The Salinas Californian reported on Aug. 24 that a fellow Soledad inmate, 
convicted Orange County murderer Kenneth Hulbert, claimed that Rothenberg said 
he would murder his wife and her new husband and kidnap David when he is 
released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Californian said Hulbert made the claim in a Monterey County Superior Court 
lawsuit that outlines a breakdown in his friendship with Rothenberg. Hulbert, 
who is serving a life term for murder, kidnap and rape, contends Rothenberg 
tried to get him into trouble with prison administrators. No trial has yet been 
scheduled for Hulbert's suit against Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg's former wife could not be reached for comment. Her husband, Buena 
Park Police Lt. Richard Hafdahl, refused to discuss the alleged threats. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Ramon Ortiz, who represented Rothenberg during his trial 
in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, said he has been in contact with 
Rothenberg since his imprisonment and had never picked up any hint of hostility 
toward the ex-wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Total Surprise' 
</P>
<P>
"He says he's getting along and has no problems. This is a total surprise to 
me," Ortiz said. "I think he wants to make amends to his son . . . so his son 
won't think he's an animal. He wants to reacquire the love of his son. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound like him at all," Ortiz said of the alleged threats. "His 
main concern is getting out (of prison) and keeping his nose clean." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz speculated that perhaps Hulbert and Rothenberg "are having a tussle and 
(Hulbert) is trying to give (Rothenberg) trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But referring to the Department of Corrections investigation, Ortiz added, "I 
guess one can never be too cautious about allegations like this."

OFFICIALS MOVE AHEAD ON PLANS FOR NEW LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach officials are moving ahead with plans to build a $7-million 
central library just north of the proposed site of the new Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Monday night to go ahead with the project. 
The building is planned for completion sometime in 1992 and will replace the 
existing central library at 856 San Clemente Drive. 
</P>
<P>
LaDonna Kienitz, city librarian, said the 50,000-square-foot building will be 
built on a four-acre site at MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway, just north 
of the museum site. The present library has only 14,000 square feet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have books on the floors at one of the branches," Kienitz said. "And 
we've had complaints from patrons that there's no place to sit down." Kienitz 
said the fund-raising arm of the library plans to raise an additional $1 
million for construction to upgrade the facilities.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: POOL EXPERT OKINAWA SLIM CHALKS UP POCKETFUL OF 
BENEFITS TO HIS HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It stands to reason that anyone named Okinawa Slim is different. Like Minnesota 
Fats, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Slim, as he prefers to be called, one of the better pool players and trick shot 
artists in Orange County, is a staff sergeant who works as an accountant at El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. He also describes himself as a devout family 
man, Christian and drug hater, and he is an articulate spokesman for pool. 
</P>
<P>
The name clearly fits him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been slim," Slim said. "And the name has a ring to it. I like it." 
</P>
<P>
He admits the name also gives the wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I'm Japanese until they see me," said the 31-year-old 
Florida-born career Marine who is married and the father of two sons. "I got my 
name from a reporter after I won the Okinawa International Open in 1980." 
</P>
<P>
He was stationed in Okinawa for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Slim, who wears a tie and glove when shooting pool to "bring respectability and 
a positive impression to the game," is reluctant to reveal his real name 
(Nathaniel Bryant), but he will talk forever about pool and the benefits it has 
offered him and can offer others. 
</P>
<P>
"Pool has come a long way from its earlier dreary reputation, and one of these 
days it will be recognized as a sport along with games like golf and tennis," 
Slim said. "Pool is easy for players to pick up and play, as opposed to other 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
He also says many pool halls have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not dark and smoke-filled or drug hangouts like some of them used to 
be," he said. "Some pool halls cater to teen-agers and don't serve alcohol. 
Today's pool players can choose the environment they want, and they can even 
take the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
That was how Slim started. 
</P>
<P>
"My father owned a billiard parlor and taught me to play when I was 6 years 
old," said the team member of the Orange County Hustlers, which competes 
throughout the western states. "I remember I had to stand on two soda crates to 
reach the table." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his early years, Slim said he made some good money hustling games, 
but no longer wants or has to hustle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything to prove anymore," said the Irvine resident, who also 
teaches pool to players ages 9 through 90 at billiard parlors in Huntington 
Beach and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Slim: "I put a lot into pool, and I get a lot from it. I don't want to die 
without sharing the knowledge it gave me." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Slim plays only exhibition games and demonstrates trick shots, and 
he usually doesn't charge for his appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I proved to myself I could be a successful pool player," he said. "I consider 
myself a performer, not a player. I put on shows." 
</P>
<P>
Slim credits the Marines for his success in life and with a pool cue. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for the Marines, I wouldn't have the name; and if it wasn't for 
the Marines, I might be out there doing something totally different," said the 
12-year veteran who joined at age 18. "I'm making the Marines my career." 
</P>
<P>
And his future with pool? 
</P>
<P>
"That's my hobby," Slim said. "The Marine Corps is my life." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Marshall, 52, chants Hebraic liturgy at night as cantor of Temple Judea 
of Laguna Hills Leisure World. So his invitation to sing the national anthem 
Sept. 6 at Anaheim Stadium is quite a change. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be the only cantor ever to sing the anthem at a ballgame," said the 
Corona del Mar resident, who works as an optometrist in Santa Ana during the 
day. He also performs professionally as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
The temple's brotherhood bought a block of seats for the game between the 
Milwaukee Brewers and the California Angels and decided to send a letter to the 
Angels suggesting that Marshall sing the anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the truth," Marshall said, "I'm more of a boxing fan. But since 
they want me to sing, I'm going to take more of an interest in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
And during the seventh-inning stretch, Marshall will lead everyone with his 
rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." 
</P>

DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER CRASH KILLS HIS MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was arrested Monday night after he allegedly ran away from an 
accident that left his mother dead and stepfather injured, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ismael Montellano Flores, 31, arrested on suspicion of felony vehicular 
manslaughter in connection with the death of his mother, Librada Montellano, 
47. He was taken to Orange County jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
She was killed instantly when her son lost control of his Nissan 280-Z while 
driving north on the 1200 block of South Fairview Street shortly after 9:30 
p.m. Monday, Santa Ana Police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The car ran off the road and hit a telephone pole, killing his mother, who was 
in the front passenger seat, Thomas said. Montellano managed to get out of the 
car along with his stepfather, Eusebio Ortega Medina, 47, and a friend after 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Montellano, who allegedly was intoxicated at the time, then ran away with the 
friend, identified as Mario Acevedo, 31, Thomas said. They were caught a short 
time later a few blocks away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega suffered a neck injury and a broken collarbone. He was treated at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Montellano was also arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, Thomas said.

ESCAPEE WHO KILLED MOTHER IS CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman committed to a state hospital in 1981 for killing her mother and 
slashing her daughter's throat was captured in Fountain Valley on Tuesday after 
escaping from a psychiatric halfway house in March, Los Angeles police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police apprehended Arlyne Louise Genger, 46, as she arrived at FHP Inc.'s 
Fountain Valley Medical Center, 9930 Talbert Ave., to pick up a paycheck for 
her work there as a telemarketing representative, Detective Walter DeCuir said. 
Genger had quit her job at the center Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She was being held at Sybil Brand Institute for Women in Los Angeles pending a 
hearing, DeCuir said. 
</P>
<P>
Genger failed to return to the Gateways Satellite residential mental-health 
facility in Silver Lake after leaving without permission on March 7, said Dr. 
Harry Goldberg, program director at the facility. She had been staying there 
since a judge, on the recommendation of psychiatrists, ordered her release from 
Patton State Hospital in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Genger had admitted that on New Year's Day, 1980, she stabbed her mother more 
than 20 times and cut her daughter's throat and wrist with a razor in the 
family's North Hollywood apartment. Her daughter, Selena, then 13, survived. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge found Genger not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
After her escape from Gateways, Genger apparently had gone to Las Vegas, where 
she lost most of her money gambling, DeCuir said. She later lived with friends 
at three or four locations in South Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police discovered that Genger had recently applied for a California driver's 
license and traced her to an apartment in Huntington Beach, DeCuir said. But 
when they arrived there last week, she had moved out, he said. They found a 
letter addressed to her from her former employer, who told police that she was 
expected to come to the office this week to pick up a paycheck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Genger most likely will be returned to Patton State Hospital, DeCuir said.

A U.S. charter plane started flying freight around Australia Tuesday as part of 
a government-approved emergency service replacing 1,600 domestic pilots who 
have resigned en masse over a pay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-based Arrow Air DC-8 with its own crew was expected to be joined by 
passenger-carrying charter flights if no quick solution could be found to the 
crisis, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Australia's Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft had been cleared for 
freight operations but the authority added that it had not received any 
inquiries about licensing charter aircraft for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Federation of Air Pilots said its members, who quit their jobs 
Thursday, would not waver in their demand for direct talks with the domestic 
airlines for a 30% raise.

MEDIAN HOME PRICE INCREASES TO $255,897 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 13 of 100 Orange County families could afford to buy an average house in 
the county in July, the California Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
That house cost $255,897 in July, the trade association said, and a family 
needed a yearly income of $86,004 to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly payments on such a house would be $2,150. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago the county's median home price was $214,227, and 21% of local 
families or households could afford it; last month it was $251,600, and 13% 
could afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was by no means the least affordable housing market in the state. 
Housing prices have soared in most areas in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco area, only 9% of families could afford a house with a 
median price of $269,982 in July. Only one in 10 Ventura County families could 
afford a median-priced house at $252,451. In Los Angeles, it was only 12%, and 
the median price was $224,456. 
</P>
<P>
The survey includes only used houses. New homes are generally even more 
expensive. The association assumes a 20% down payment in its calculations. 
</P>
<P>
The affordability crunch hurts businesses' ability to recruit and retain 
employees, and some economists fret about the eventual impact of high housing 
prices on the state's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
Across California, only 16% of families could afford the median-priced house, 
which cost $202,650 in July. A family needed an income of $68,108 to meet the 
monthly payments of $1,703 on such a home, the trade association calculated. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, 22% of families in the state could afford a house. 
</P>
<P>
Still, lower mortgage rates have offset higher housing prices to some extent, 
the trade association said. The percentage of families who can afford a house 
has stabilized and didn't change between July and June. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, it has been at 13% since May. 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums, by contrast, are in heavy demand because so few families can 
afford a single-family house. Condo prices are growing more rapidly beyond the 
means of California families. The median price soared statewide by nearly 
$8,000 during July, to $145,867. 
</P>
<P>
That meant only 29% of families statewide could afford a condo, down from 30% 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Separate figures for condominiums in Orange County were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFFORDABILITY INDEX FOR RESALE HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen percent of Orange County households could afford to buy the 
median-priced resale home in the county in July, unchanged since May and

INVESTOR SUES TO PREVENT PAYMENT OF 'BUST-UP' FEE

<P>
Newport Electronics Inc.'s largest shareholder has asked a federal court to 
block the Santa Ana firm from paying a $400,000 "bust-up" fee to a Silicon 
Valley company in the wake of a scrapped merger attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut investor Milton B. Hollander claims in a lawsuit that Sensor 
Control Corp. of Sunnyvale is not entitled to a $400,000 fee for legal, 
administrative and other expenses incurred when it tried unsuccessfully to 
merge with Newport. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed on Aug. 20 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, claims that 
Sensor acted fraudulently by not disclosing problems it was having in arranging 
financing for the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Newport, a manufacturer of digital electronic measurement instruments, and 
Sensor, a maker of heat and pressure sensors for industrial applications, 
agreed to merge last April, but the deal ran into trouble in July after 
Hollander launched a rival offer for Newport. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor dropped its bid earlier this month after Newport Chairman Barret B. 
Weekes and director Norman Gray said they would sell their combined 25% stake 
in Newport to Hollander. Sensor had offered to acquire 43% of Newport shares 
for $9.75 each and the remaining shares for $9 each in a merger agreement. 
</P>

Sensor's withdrawal cleared the way for Hollander to complete his offer to pay 
$11 per share for 35% of Newport stock, raising his stake to 48%. After his 
offer is completed, Hollander plans to oust three of Newport's five directors 
and replace them with his own. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander's suit claims that Sensor failed to disclose to Newport "the tenuous 
nature of Sensor's financing arrangements for the tender offer and merger 
agreement." It also alleges that they failed to disclose that BT Commercial 
Corp. was reconsidering its commitment to extend credit to Sensor because of 
deterioration in the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor President James B. Hawkins declined to comment on the Hollander suit. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander states in his suit that certain Newport directors who backed the 
Sensor bid stood to profit from the merger by the cancellation of their stock 
options. The suit claims that Norman Gray, John Virtue and Robert H. Davis 
would have made $90,000 on cancellation of stock options and that director 
George Pratt would have made $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to nullify the board's approval of a $400,000 fee as 
reimbursement for expenses it incurred as part of its merger agreement. Gray 
said Newport's board believed that Sensor was entitled to payment. 
</P>
<P>
'The board decided we should pay it as soon as possible," Gray said Tuesday. 
"We felt it was a valid obligation." 
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Hollander claims that paying the fee would hurt Newport's 
financial condition because that amount is more money than the company has in 
cash on hand. Gray said the fee does exceed the company's cash, although he did 
not specify how much cash the company has. He said Newport probably would have 
to borrow money to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander's suit also seeks $5 million in punitive damages against Newport and 
Sensor.

JACKSON COMING TO IRVINE WITH A SURLY ATTITUDE, VERSATILE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That Joe Jackson sure seems to be one arrogant chap, not to mention a surly 
cynic, contemptuous cuss and all-round critical dude. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah -- he's something of a snob as well. 
</P>
<P>
But those are probably the very qualities that over the last decade have 
allowed the New York-based Englishman to carve out an ambitious and distinctive 
body of uncompromising pop, much of which was on display Monday at the Wiltern 
Theatre in Los Angeles. Jackson will play Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 2 1/2-hour set at the Wiltern covered both the wiry singer's 
eclectic career and -- in two six-song suites presenting his entire latest 
album, "Blaze of Glory" -- his lifetime. Jackson used the talents of a 
versatile 10-piece band to range from quasiclassical (his "Home Town" melody 
was set against an adaptation for horns and violin of Pachelbel's Canon in D) 
to biting rock ("I'm the Man") to jazzy jumpin' jive (a swinging encore 
medley). 
</P>
<P>
The horns in particular were used to provide sometimes Ellingtonian coloration 
to the songs (much the same way Steely Dan used to employ brass), adding new 
dimensions to old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Within the set, especially the "Blaze of Glory" suites, Jackson ranged 
thematically from the New Frontier optimism of "Tomorrow's World" to the 
resigned frustration of "Evil Empire." 
</P>
<P>
Impressive indeed. While Jackson's no visionary (his music and especially his 
lyrics fall short of the kind of insightful abstractions that would qualify as 
poetic), the show left little doubt about his talent and ability to achieve his 
lofty artistic goals. 
</P>
<P>
But getting in the way of any real connection at each step was that dang 
attitude. Like Frank Zappa, another surly perfectionist, Jackson specializes in 
the put-down. On Monday, in one song after the other, Jackson aimed his snarly 
sneer at those he perceives as boobs: the ugly Americans of "Jet Set," the 
over-the-hill rocker -- performed by Jackson in a gravity-defying pompadour 
wig, silver lame coat and bulging prosthetic belly -- of "Nineteen Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he threw a brief snit at a sound mixer and sparred occasionally 
-- and not always good-naturedly -- with the audience. OK, the guy who asked 
for the songs to be sped up deserved the comeback, "Why don't you go see the 
Ramones?" And the nerd who got on stage and danced like a loon probably 
deserved more than the gentle kick in the derriere that Jackson gave him. 
</P>
<P>
And even when he complimented the crowd for its enthusiasm, he felt the need to 
note that past L.A. audiences had not been so good. The only people about whom 
he had anything unreservedly nice to say were the members of his band. 
</P>
<P>
If he has no sympathy or patience for anyone else, why should we have any for 
him? Admiration? Without question. Appreciation for his accomplishments? 
Indubitably. But not much honest, deep feeling. 
</P>
<P>
So when at the end of "Blaze of Glory" he sang, "All I want to do is give you 
the human touch," you had to wonder where it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Jackson sings Friday at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 
Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Tickets: $21.50. Parking: $5. Information: (714) 
855-6111.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: 2 JOFFREY DANCERS HAIL BALLET PACIFICA DATE AS 
CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the dangers of being in a repertory company is that you can get 
typecast. Tina LeBlanc and Edward Stierle -- members of the Joffrey Ballet -- 
for instance, have reputations for speed, virtuosity and persuasive 
characterization. 
</P>
<P>
No one associates them with the eloquent classicism of Petipa's "Sleeping 
Beauty" or the show-stopping circus pas de deux culled from the 19th-Century 
story ballet "Don Quixote." 
</P>
<P>
So when they guest as a pair with Ballet Pacifica to dance these works on 
Saturday, both see it as an opportunity to expand their range and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
For LeBlanc, 22, the roles as Kitri in the "Don Quixote" pas de deux and Aurora 
in "Sleeping Beauty" are both fresh territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a totally new experience for me," she said in a recent phone 
interview. "But who in their right mind wouldn't want to do Aurora?" 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc dismissed questions about technical difficulties facing her in the 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
"For me the hardest part is the characterization," she said. "Really, we are 
talking about two totally different people. Kitri is a very headstrong brat. 
Yeah, I'm used to playing things like that. Aurora in 'Sleeping Beauty' is more 
demure, more elegant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I want the audience to see the characters, not me, and (I want to) be 
convincing in both." 
</P>
<P>
For Stierle, also 22, at least one of the works is old hat. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Don Q' is my thing," he said. "I've done 'Don Q' many times," including a 
performance that won him a gold medal in the International Ballet Competition 
in Jackson, Miss., in 1986. He also danced the role at a festival of medal 
winners in Paris in 1985. (He had won a gold medal in the Prix de Lausanne 
Competition in January, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
But the Prince in "Sleeping Beauty" is new to him and a different kind of role. 
</P>
<P>
"It is anti-type for me," he said. "I am known as a virtuoso. So it really 
helps me; it excites me to be seen in this light. And it challenges me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc and Stierle have danced together in Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere" and 
have been in Ashton's "La Fille Mal Gardee," both works seen in Orange County 
in the last two years. They are also learning Joffrey artistic director Gerald 
Arpino's "Suite Saint-Saens." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are very well suited to dance together," LeBlanc said. "You make a 
connection with Eddie. With some dancers you don't feel the connection." 
</P>
<P>
The two were invited to dance by Molly Lynch, artistic director of Ballet 
Pacifica, who is a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it would be encouraging and inspiring to our dancers to work with 
people from a professional company," Lynch said. "I felt it would also draw 
more attention to Ballet Pacifica at a time I would like to encourage people to 
come see the company." 
</P>
<P>
With their own rehearsal schedules with the Joffrey in Los Angeles running from 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day, however, LeBlanc and Stierle have had to hustle to 
find time to rehearse. 
</P>
<P>
"We shove down our lunch and work during our work breaks," Stierle said. 
"Basically, it's been a lot of hard work. It has not been easy getting it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Stierle cites establishing a dialogue between the two as the "most important 
task." 
</P>
<P>
"When doing 'Don Q,' the dialogue is more fiery and sharp," he said. "You're 
looking at each other with passion and that kind of energy, almost a 
competitive kind of energy. In 'Sleeping Beauty,' your dialogue has to be more 
loving. It's your wedding. You love each other. It's more that kind of 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Timing and coordination are also challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those fractions of a second that are so important, that can make a 
performance seem so clear, so easy and elegant." 
</P>
<P>
Neither sees any problems in doing guest spots with Ballet Pacifica, a regional 
company that they had not seen at the time of their interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guest work is done with regional companies," LeBlanc said. "Very 
rarely do people guest with major companies because they have their own 
dancers." 
</P>
<P>
Stierle added: "This is such a wonderful opportunity for us to grow as artists. 
Whether performing for Ballet Pacifica or Joffrey, we are expanding our 
artistic horizons. In a sense, we grow as artists no matter what company we are 
performing for." 
</P>
<P>
 Joffrey Ballet dancers Tina LeBlanc and Edward Stierle will be guests with 
Ballet Pacifica at 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Irvine Bowl, 650 Laguna Canyon 
Road, Laguna Beach. LeBlanc and Stierle will dance the "Don Quixote" pas de 
deux and Aurora and Florimund in Act III of "The Sleeping Beauty." Also on the 
program: Kathy Kahn's "A Careless Ease" and Israel (El) Gabriel's "Solitude." 
Tickets: $6 to $20. Information: (714) 642-9275.

<P>
KIROV SOUVENIRS: After the Kirov Ballet's recently ended nine-day run in Orange 
County, company dancers will be taking home memories -- and bars of soap and 
boxes of detergent, according to people who accompanied or spotted dancers on 
local shopping tours. 
</P>
<P>
While audiences in the Performing Arts Center may savor aesthetic memories, the 
dancers themselves reportedly went into raves about the variety and 
availability of everyday items such as toothpaste and soap that are treasured 
commodities in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
And forget about the high-priced stuff in glamour malls: The hottest item, 
apparently, was Woolite. Of course -- all those tights to wash.

CENTER INCURS DEFICIT DESPITE SOLD-OUT KIROV 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kirov Ballet sold out all nine days of its run that ended Sunday at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, according to Center President Thomas R. 
Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
About 260,370 people attended, Kendrick said Tuesday, with roughly 60% of that 
number buying single tickets as opposed to subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
With a top ticket price of $65 during the company's only Southern California 
engagement, receipts totaled $1,433,475, according to Kendrick. But even at 
that, income from ticket sales will not cover all the costs of the engagement. 
However, the subsidy required to make up the difference will be less than first 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"We originally projected a subsidy of $300,000," Kendrick said. "I hope it will 
be half of that." CHRIS PASLES

HEFNER, NEW WIFE EXPECTING IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, 63, who ended 30 years of bachelorhood last month 
to marry model Kimberley Conrad, will become a father again in April, a Playboy 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who wondered how we spent our honeymoon, the answer will be in 
April," the spokesman, Bill Farley, quoted Hefner as telling friends. 
</P>
<P>
Hefner, who for years preached that marriage kills romance, married 26-year-old 
Conrad, a magazine Playmate of the Year, in front of a wishing well at Playboy 
Mansion West on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second marriage for Hefner, one of the world's best-known bachelors. 
He has two children by his first marriage -- Christie, president of Playboy 
Enterprises, and David. Hefner's first marriage, to Mildred Williams, ended in 
divorce in 1959.

WOMAN WHO HELPED KILL 2 SENTENCED TO GAS CHAMBER 
</P>

Cynthia Lynn Coffman, who admitted she helped her boyfriend kill two young 
women in the Southland in a weeklong crime rampage, today became the first 
woman sentenced to death in California since capital punishment was reinstated 
12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, 27, sitting eight feet from co-defendant James Gregory Marlow, 33, 
tearfully told a San Bernardino County Superior Court judge, "I'm sorry for 
what happened and I'm ashamed that I let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Don A. Turner, who upheld jury death verdicts for both, said he 
agrees with the jury's conclusion that Coffman "was in this thing up to the 
hilt and enjoyed it right up to the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, who has an 8-year-old son, will be housed at the Correctional 
Institution for Women at Frontera. If her appeal, expected to take at least 
seven years, is unsuccessful, she will be executed at San Quentin State Prison, 
site of the state's only gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The last woman executed in California was Elizabeth Ann Duncan, on Aug. 8, 
1962, for the murder of her daughter-in-law in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman and Marlow, who has a long prison and arrest record, were convicted of 
first-degree murder five months ago for the Nov. 7, 1986, slaying of 
20-year-old insurance clerk Corinna Novis. The young woman had given the couple 
a ride when they approached her in the parking lot of the Redlands Mall. 
</P>
<P>
The two are scheduled to stand trial in Orange County for the murder of 
19-year-old Lynell Murray, found dead in Huntington Beach five days after the 
Novis killing. Details of the Murray slaying at a Huntington Beach motel were 
presented at the penalty phase of the couple's trial in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said it was clear to him that both Marlow and Coffman intended for 
the two young women to die. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons she was fascinated with Mr. Marlow and made him her man is 
that he had the strength to do the things she could not do," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Once lovers -- he called her his Sinful and she has his nickname, Folsom Wolf, 
tattooed on her bottom -- Coffman and Marlow became enemies during their San 
Bernardino trial 
</P>
<P>
Coffman claimed during her testimony that she was under Marlow's domination 
during the killings. She said she believed that Marlow intended only to kidnap 
and rob Novis, not to kill her. Coffman admitted, however, that after the two 
kidnaped Murray at a Huntington Beach store where she worked, she helped twist 
a towel around the victim's neck in the motel room. She claimed she was upset 
that Marlow had had sex with the young woman but said she could not finish the 
job of killing her.

ANOTHER 3 JUDGES RESIGN IN COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
MAYOR PUTS COCAINE CAPITAL UNDER CURFEW TO COMBAT VIOLENCE

<P>
Three more judges resigned in Medellin, the nation's cocaine capital, after 
threats were made by drug lords seeking to halt a government crackdown on 
narcotics trafficking, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez put the city under a 10 
p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew to help combat the string of bombings and other attacks 
that have plagued the city. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations of three more judges brought to 108 the number of judges who 
have quit since the traffickers vowed Aug. 18 to retaliate against the 
government, police, journalists and others seen as a threat to the drug empire. 
</P>
<P>
The traffickers have said they will kill 10 judges for every Colombian 
extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin magistrates, who resigned on Tuesday, had been investigating 
slayings believed to have been ordered by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The government, meanwhile, was reported to be preparing to extradite to the 
United States the first drug figure since the traffickers' terror campaign 
began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The syndicated TV news program "Noticiero 24 Horas" reported the Colombian 
government notified Eduardo Martinez Romero on Tuesday that he had five working 
days, or until next Tuesday, to appeal an extradition notice. Martinez, a 
35-year-old economist, faces federal charges in Atlanta in connection with a 
$1.2-billion operation for laundering cocaine profits. He is being held under 
heavy guard by the investigations division of Colombia's national police force. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities imposed the curfew on Medellin today after a series of bombings 
this week and the foiling of a rocket attack on a fuel tank Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police said three men stepped from a taxi Tuesday night, pulled four hand-held 
rocket launchers from a suitcase and aimed them at the tank at a state-owned 
liquor factory. Factory guards scared them off by opening fire, averting 
possible disaster for 90 workers inside the plant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, soldiers patrolled city streets in Medellin, stopping pedestrians 
to search them for weapons and check their identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the capital, a Defense Ministry spokesman said 11,015 people had so far been 
detained in the nationwide operation against suspected drug traffickers started 
on Aug. 18 after the assassination of a judge, a Medellin police commander and 
a leading presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Police and troops have also seized 346 aircraft and 464 ranches, estates, 
buildings and homes worth millions of dollars belonging to suspected 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Military and police have conducted 1,965 searches as part of the crackdown, 
seizing 1,313 land vehicles, 925 arms, 6,064 rounds of ammunition, 168 two-way 
radios, almost five tons of cocaine paste and 450 pounds of cocaine.

<P>
A Lancaster woman was arrested and held without bail this morning after she 
allegedly shot a man to death because she believed he was providing her 
17-year-old daughter with drugs, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Belita Fox, 40, was arrested about 1 a.m. in a house on 5th Street East after 
she called 911 and said, "There has been a murder," Deputy George Ducoulombier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrived at the house and found Kevin Furman, 23, dead in a bedroom. He 
had been shot three times, Ducoulombier said. Deputies said there were at least 
three other people in the house at the time of the shooting but did not 
disclose whether Fox's daughter was among them.

DEPUTY NOT FAULTED IN HANDLING 911 CALL OF WOMAN SLAIN MINUTES LATER

Sheriff Sherman Block today said a 911 dispatcher properly handled a call from 
a woman who was among four women slain 15 minutes later in an East Los Angeles 
birthday party rampage allegedly committed by her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly," Block told a news conference. 
"She did not violate any department policies or procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Delia Navarro dialed 911 Sunday night after being warned that her husband 
was going to shoot up her 27th birthday party. The dispatcher told her to call 
back if the man arrived. About 15 minutes later, Raymond Navarro Jr. allegedly 
burst into the converted garage that his estranged wife was renting and began 
firing a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Block said the deputy who took the call is a Latina sensitive to the Eastside 
community in which she worked. "We don't find any fault with the way she 
proceeded," he said.

DOROTHY SCHIFF, EX-POST PUBLISHER, DIES

<P>
Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who molded the historic New York Post into one of 
the nation's most liberal dailies during her 37 years at its helm, died of 
cancer today. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Faris, a vice president at the Post, said Schiff died at her Manhattan 
home. She had been sick since May. 
</P>
<P>
The Post, Schiff once said, advocated "honest unionism, social reform and 
humane government programs." Her paper was a middle-class tabloid, packed with 
columns and features, restrained only by Schiff's legendary tight fist. 
</P>
<P>
The Post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in America, first 
published by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, and was one of the few metropolitan 
newspapers owned by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
She was credited with saving the Post when she broke with other publishers 
during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed publishing under the old 
contract. The paper gained circulation during that period, and within a few 
years became the city's only afternoon paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive journalistic 
climate, she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as Hearst's Journal-American, 
Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun, and John Hay Whitney's Herald Tribune, 
and in the end outlasted them," noted Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 19, 1976, after years of turning down potential buyers, she sold the 
Post to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, reportedly for $31 million. Murdoch 
transformed the Post into a racier and more politically conservative tabloid 
before selling it to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow last year. 
</P>
<P>
Schiff's grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of the Kuhn, Loeb 
banking house and a prominent philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
Her four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was Richard B. W. Hall, 
followed by politician and editor George Backer, editor Theodor Olin Thackrey 
and Rudolf Sonneborn.

ARTISTS HALT CORCORAN EXHIBITS IN WAKE OF SHOW'S CANCELLATION

<P>
A boycott by some artists of the Corcoran Gallery over its cancellation of a 
photography exhibit including pictures of genitalia has led to the "indefinite 
postponement" of two other scheduled contemporary art exhibits, gallery 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduling in June of the exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe touched off a 
political controversy that resulted in Congress moving to restrict federal 
subsidies for artists. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery said today that contemporary artist Annette Lemieux has pulled what 
it described as her "first major one-person museum exhibition" scheduled to run 
from Oct. 28 to Dec. 31. and that six sculptors also have canceled a show of 
their work scheduled to run from Feb. 3 to April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Shriver, a spokeswoman for the Corcoran, acknowledged that 10 American 
painters, including Lemieux, featured in a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be 
presented next spring have also threatened to deny the gallery the right to 
display their work. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted this summer to cut the National Endowment of the Arts' budget 
by $45,000 -- the total of federal grants received by Mapplethorpe and Andres 
Serrano, a photographer whose picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine also 
touched off a protest. 
</P>
<P>
And the Senate last month approved legislation by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
that would prohibit federal financing of sexually explicit artwork.

RIGHT WING SEEN GAINING IN BID TO BAN SCHOOL TEXTS

Religious extremists and members of right-wing organizations are gaining in 
their battle to ban or censor library books and to restrict sex education in 
schools, an anti-censorship group said in a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize that what is at stake in the battles being fought in 
communities across the nation is more than just the fate of a few novels or a 
textbook or two," said John Buchanan, chairman of People For the American Way, 
founded by television producer Norman Lear. 
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing in these skirmishes the clash of two competing views of 
public education in America. The censors see efforts to teach our children 
about the world around them as a threat; the rest of us see it as a way to 
broaden our children's vistas and opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The survey found censorship and other ideological attacks on public education 
occurred in 42 of the 50 states. It focused on 172 incidents that occurred 
during the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The West led in total number of incidents this year, 61, and California 
accumulated more incidents than any other state with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Sex education remains a major target of the far right, which "already scored 
some damaging victories" during the last school year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, for example, the report cited statewide restrictions that 
forced school textbook publishers to delete information on the use of condoms 
to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The report said school libraries were the target of significantly more 
censorship attempts during the last school year. 
</P>
<P>
The main targets of such challenges were literary classics such as John 
Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and J. D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," as 
well as plays by Arthur Miller and Aristophanes, the report said.

An American Airlines MD-80 jet made an emergency landing at an airport today 
after one of its three hydraulic systems failed, an airline spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 891, carrying 66 passengers and a crew of six from Oklahoma City to 
Dallas, returned to Will Rogers World Airport 11 minutes after taking off, said 
American spokesman Jim Brown. He said that even the loss of all three of the 
hydraulic systems would not result in the pilot losing control of the airplane 
as happened with a DC-10 that crashed at Sioux City, Iowa. Brown said a cable 
system would pilot the aircraft in the event of complete hydraulic failure.

LANGUAGE LAW COMPROMISE IN MOLDAVIA URGED

Moldavia's Communist Party chief, in an effort to placate outraged minority 
groups, proposed today that the republic adopt a weaker version of a law making 
Moldavian the official language, an activist said. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, which reportedly resulted from a telephone conversation between 
the party chief and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is aimed at stopping 
widespread strikes and other protests in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
The initial proposed law would substitute Moldavian for Russian in virtually 
all government and business transactions in the republic. Russians and other 
minorities in the republic say the proposal is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Language for Government 
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise, outlined to the Supreme Soviet by Moldavian party 
chief Semen Grossu, would make Moldavian the language for government officials 
and documents, and Russian the tongue for everyday contact among the republic's 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament had been expected to vote today on the language issue, but Yuri 
Roshka, a spokesman for the autonomist Moldavian Popular Front, said the vote 
had been put off until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Parliament has appointed a commission to draft the final document. It will 
be presented to the deputies tomorrow morning and the vote will take place 
after 2 p.m.," he told Reuters from the republic's capital, Kishinev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Proposal 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal was reported by Vasily Nestase, a leader of the 
pro-Moldavian People's Front who spoke by telephone to the Associated Press 
from Kishinev. 
</P>
<P>
Moldavia, which borders Romania, now has no law specifying which language is to 
be used, but Russian has traditionally been the tongue for government affairs.

TUTU'S WIFE ARRESTED AT PROTEST RALLY;

<P>
Police today arrested the wife of Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and about 
200 other women protesting capital punishment and the detention of children. 
Security forces also fired shotguns in clashes with students. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the students were wounded by police shotgun fire, and hundreds fled 
clouds of tear gas in Cape Town's mixed-race suburbs of Athlone and Mitchell's 
Plain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud," Tutu said after hearing that his wife, Leah, and about 200 
other women were arrested in central Cape Town when they tried to march to the 
British Embassy to deliver a message about capital punishment and the detention 
of children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have Shown Us Up' 
</P>
<P>
"The women have shown us up. They have shown us how to organize these things," 
Tutu said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested also included Dorothy Boesak, wife of World Alliance of Reformed 
Churches leader Allan Boesak, and Dorothy Zihlangu, 67, chairwoman of the 
Federation of South African Women. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the women would be charged with participating in an illegal 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Club-wielding police sealed off the area around Greenmarket Square and bundled 
the women into police trucks when they ignored an order to disperse because of 
an emergency rule ban on open-air protests. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to ask British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to intercede with 
the South African government to stop the hanging of our people and the 
detention of our children," said Mary Barton, president of the anti-apartheid 
Black Sash organization, who was among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa ranks third to Iran and Iraq in the use of capital punishment and 
has detained more than 30,000 people, many of them children, without charges 
for up to three years since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Onlookers Boo Police 
</P>
<P>
Close to 2,000 onlookers booed police and applauded the women with shouts of 
"Viva African National Congress," referring to the outlawed guerrilla group 
fighting white rule. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police backed by armored personnel carriers and a low-flying helicopter 
clashed with students who burned car tire barricades outside four schools in 
Athlone and Mitchell's Plain. 
</P>
<P>
Three students were wounded, one apparently seriously, when police fired at 
youths inside West Ridge High School, where they searched classrooms and 
arrested six youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
A Reuters reporter saw a doctor treat one boy on a stretcher for multiple 
pellet wounds in the head, back, arms and buttocks.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is 
examining ways to reduce capital gains taxes, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen told the Wall Street Journal in a telephone interview that he intends 
to ask his tax-writing committee to devise a bill that would raise federal 
revenues about $8 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Such an increase would extend several tax breaks that are about to expire, 
including the credit for research and development expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said a capital gains tax cut "is one of those things we'll have to take 
a look at" as part of the tax package.

DOW CREEPS UP 1.52 AFTER SEESAW SESSION

<P>
Wall Street stocks eked out a gain today, supported by strength in 
transportation stocks and some drug companies, after a seesaw session pushed 
the market up and down throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.52 points to 2,728.15 after falling 
16.73 points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight gain in blue chips, transportation stocks soared on 
continuing takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones transportation average rose 22.94 points to 1,529.52, shattering 
its previous record set Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, gaining issues led declines 8-7 in fairly active trading 
of 174.35 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Rise 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices continued higher in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or nearly $2 per $1,000 
face amount, while its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.18% 
from 8.21% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market, normally leery of strong economic growth because it raises 
inflation risks, held up well after the government reported that personal 
incomes rose a healthy 0.7% in July, the best gain in four months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, consumer spending climbed 0.7%, its fastest pace in three months, 
the Commerce Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the government significantly revised upward its estimate of total 
economic growth, showing that the gross national product was growing at a 
healthy annual rate of 2.7% in the April-June quarter instead of the anemic 
1.7% GNP rate originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders took the GNP report in stride because it was accompanied by a 
slight downward revision in an inflation indicator that is tied to GNP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasury Issues Rise 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose about 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose about 1/8 point and 
long-term issues were up about 1/4 point, according to Telerate Inc., the 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 3.30 to 1,175.46. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 
0.17 to 327.87. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yields Decline 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8% as the discount fell 5 basis 
points to 7.85%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.22% as the discount fell 4 
basis points to 7.80%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.32% as the discount 
fell 3 basis points to 7.73%.

AUSTRALIAN TOURISM FEELS PINCH OF STRIKE;

$4-MILLION DAILY LOSS, OCCUPANCY SLUMP HIT RESORTS AND HOTELS

Australia's tourist industry, starved of domestic airline services for the past 
week, is facing ruin because of widespread cancellations by nervous overseas 
visitors, operators said today. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts and hotels reported a slump in occupancy rates since the weekend when 
travelers realized that the dispute, which has grounded all domestic airlines 
since Thursday, was set to continue for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's bleeding here at the moment," said Gaynor Cooper, marketing 
manager of the Yulara Resort in the shadow of Ayers Rock in the central 
Australian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect to be 100% full at this time of year but our occupancy rate is 
very low. People are canceling because they are afraid they won't be able to 
get back home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Tourism Commission estimates the dispute is costing the industry 
$4 million each day. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Australia's most important foreign exchange earner and reaped $4.9 
billion from around 2.2 million visitors in the last financial year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had quite massive cancellations from abroad. There's been a huge loss of 
confidence," said Owen French, manager of a string of island resorts off 
Queensland. "Overseas travel agents are just taking Australia out of the 
schedules." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 pilots resigned en masse last week after the three largest domestic 
airlines refused to consider their demand for a 30% pay raise, bringing chaos 
to the transport system of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said they had received more than 800 responses from pilots to job 
advertisements they placed in newspapers around the world. But they warned it 
would take about four weeks for the applications to be processed and new pilots 
trained. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the tropical resort of Hamilton Island, which reported a 50% 
drop in occupancy rates, said it was chartering aircraft at great cost to ferry 
in Japanese tourists from Sydney and Cairns. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel and resort operators said they were cutting staff working hours and 
considering temporary layoffs to reduce losses. Larger operators are 
considering suing the pilots for damages, industry officials said.

Danny Ferry and Brian Shaw, the newly acquired American basketball stars of 
Messaggero Roma, combined for more than half their team's points in a 
tournament game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry scored 30 points and Shaw added 23 as Messaggero trounced second-division 
Penapesca Montecatini 104-80 in the opening round of the Lido delle Rose 
tournament. It was the first tournament game in Italy for Ferry, the Duke 
All-American who spurned the Clippers, and Shaw, formerly of the Boston 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Messaggero a berth in the tournament finals against Arimo 
Bologna, whose lineup includes Americans Chris McNealy and Dave Feitl. Feitl 
and McNealy scored 21 and 15 points, respectively, in Arimo's 94-82 victory 
over Rangers Varese.

<P>
South Carolina Highway Patrol Officer Robert E. Gambrell stopped Allen, 21, 
early Sunday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to 
a booking report and confinement record, said Officer Jerry Zimmerman, 
assistant supervisor at the Oconee County Law Enforcement Center. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was released on a personal recognizance bond after appearing before 
Magistrate Judge Larry Butts, Zimmerman said. A court date was tentatively set 
for Sept. 12, a highway patrol supervisor said.

Roger Kingdom won the gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles today at the World 
University Games, but cold weather and stiffness prevented the two-time Olympic 
champion from challenging his own world record. 
</P>
<P>
Americans also won three gold medals in relays on the final day of the games, 
tying them with the Soviet Union for the lead with nine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very stiff this morning, and I was concerned about that," Kingdom said. 
"I just didn't have enough." Kingdom won easily, but his time of 13.26 was well 
outside his 2-week-old world record of 12.92. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to break it again," he said. "I felt pretty good yesterday. (In the 
heats) I was hitting quite a few hurdles, and today we had the wind in front of 
us, which is good because I ran well against the wind. But I just wasn't able 
to break the record."

Former University of Kentucky point guard Sean Sutton said today that he has 
returned home and will sit out the coming season instead of following through 
with a commitment to attend Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to leave Purdue, return to Lexington Community College and 
concentrate on my studies and basketball skills," Sutton said in a news 
release. "I will not play collegiate basketball again until next year." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing in Sutton's statement about what schools he might consider 
attending next year. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who averaged 5.9 points and led Kentucky with 146 assists last season, 
announced his intention to transfer to Purdue on Aug. 3, two months after Rick 
Pitino was hired as Kentucky's coach. Pitino replaced Sutton's father, Eddie 
Sutton, who resigned in the wake of an NCAA investigation into the school's 
basketball program.

Former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier was released from the hospital 
today, six days after going in for observation after a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier will reschedule a series of personal appearances for the next few 
months while he recuperates, Manager Burt Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They checked him for broken bones, internal injuries and gave him an overall 
physical," said Watson. Although Frazier, 45, was found to be in good shape, 
his doctors told him to take it easy for the next couple of weeks, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to strengthen himself from being in there," said Watson. "He needs to 
build his resistance back." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Frazier was driving to his gym on Aug. 20 when his limousine was 
bumped from behind by a van. He didn't feel any discomfort until a few days 
later, when he complained of aches in his legs and stiffness in his back, 
Watson said.

One of the Soviet mushers will be training with three-time Iditarod champion

Phillips is expected to leave for Provideniya in the Soviet Union next month. 
She is to be joined by Butcher and Wasilla veterinarian Phil Meyer. They are to
