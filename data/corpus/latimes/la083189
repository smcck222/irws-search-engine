SEPT. 16 CELEBRATION AT LINCOLN PARK CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a melee that marred this year's Cinco de Mayo celebration at 
Lincoln Park, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre has canceled the 
traditional Mexican Independence Day observance scheduled for Sept. 16 at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
After meetings with community groups, the police and other interested parties, 
Alatorre said the policy of allowing beer consumption at such events needs more 
study. Also to be studied, he said, are security, entertainment and whether 
such events should be two-day observances. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sept. 16 celebrations are still planned throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the consumption of beer at the park celebrations, 
allowed by the city in part because beer companies underwrite the festivities, 
has changed the focus and tenor of such holidays. Events to promote ethnic 
pride have turned into glorified beer busts, they contend.

EDITOR ALBERTO DIAZ EULOGIZED AS A MAN WHO CARED, HELPED OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Diaz was a typical community newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
He doled out advice to politicos and strangers who sought it. He expressed 
outrage through his columns when he thought that his community was getting a 
raw deal. He occasionally dipped into his own pockets to help out a reader with 
a hard-luck story. And he encouraged young Chicanos, who never thought that 
they could make it into journalism, to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
It was no wonder that Alberto C. Diaz, who died July 28, was dubbed "Mr. East 
L.A." in the 1950s by others who marveled at his knowledge and involvement of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained East Los Angeles to itself and to the outside world," said Felix 
Gutierrez, a newly appointed dean at USC. Gutierrez, a former journalism 
educator, called Diaz an important influence in his own media career and said, 
"He helped me get my first scholarship when I entered college." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the tenor of the tributes to Diaz, who died of heart failure and 
complications from Parkinson's disease. Diaz, 72, was the longtime editor and 
publisher of two Eastside weekly newspapers -- the Belvedere Citizen and the 
Eastside Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz was affectionately recalled as a man who deeply cared for his community at 
a time when the overwhelmingly Mexican-American area carried little political 
or economic clout. 
</P>
<P>
"People would come into his office with some problem," said David Barron, a 
communications representative for Southern California Edison Co., who got his 
start in the media under Diaz's tutelage. "He'd make a few calls and get things 
squared away." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz did more than that for countless hundreds over the years from his office 
on East 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
"His big thing was the annual Christmas party that he helped put on," said 
Sarah Dorado, a former colleague and current classified advertising manager for 
the two newspapers. "He always looked forward to it. He loved kids." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz turned out to be a valuable source for politicians, other newspapermen and 
others who wanted to understand the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
"All the politicians running for office came through to see him -- John 
Kennedy, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon," Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
But his insights were, perhaps, on best display in his column, called "The 
Beachcomber." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody waited for his column to come out and figure out what was really 
going on in East L.A.," said longtime Eastside leader Sal Lopez, who met Diaz 
while the two were students at Garfield High School in the mid-1930s. "He would 
cover the good and the bad." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, while political dissent over the Vietnam War divided the country, 
Gutierrez said Diaz gave coverage to those who opposed the war even though he 
disagreed with them. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, whose chronicling of Eastside life spanned more than 40 years, received 
numerous honors and appointments. He was a former president of the Belvedere 
Rotary Club and the Greater Los Angeles Press Club. In 1962, he was named to 
the state Recreation Commission and two years later to the state Athletic 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He was recognized by the California Chicano News Media Assn. in 1983 for being 
among the first prominent Latino figures in Los Angeles journalism. But perhaps 
his greatest honor was in 1981, when county supervisors renamed a portion of 
Belvedere Park after him -- the Alberto C. Diaz Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, Diaz, who is survived by his wife, mother, a brother, three 
sons and three grandchildren, was slowed by diabetes and other afflictions. He 
was blind at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"But he used to say, 'I may be blind but I haven't lost my vision,' " Gutierrez 
said.

HIS EXPLOIT TURNED INTO A BITTER MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEDRO ARROYO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all started at 5:15 a.m. one Saturday on a filthy street of East Los 
Angeles. There they stood ambitiously, at the intersection of Atlantic and 
Beverly boulevards. Some well postured, some not. Some young, some old. 
</P>
<P>
All were different, with one purpose in mind: to get a day's work and make 
money. 
</P>
<P>
A pickup truck driven by a man in his late 40s slowly approached the 
intersection. Suddenly the group of about 25 men, including myself, proceeded 
toward the vehicle. And, in almost perfect unison, we began to scream, "Senor, 
que necesita? Que le gustaria que hagamos para usted? (What do you need, sir? 
What would you like us to do for you?)" 
</P>
<P>
He introduced himself as Roberto and looked us over from head to toe. He 
selected two Mexican nationals -- Miguel and Juan -- and me. 
</P>
<P>
We hopped in the truck and Roberto drove away. For a moment, I was really 
confused because I did not know why I had been chosen. There were 22 men who 
were probably stronger and more capable of handling this job than I. Maybe it 
was because of my loud mouth -- I screamed to get his attention -- and my 
fluorescent shirt and shorts. I remember being laughed at by another man when I 
was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
As a 17-year-old student, I did not have a particular reason for working with 
the day laborers. But I had always wanted to find out what these laborers go 
through in order to put food on the table. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel was a talkative strong man from Veracruz. He was wearing a pair of old, 
worn-out jeans and a red T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Juan was about 5-foot-10. I tried hard to get him to speak, but all my efforts 
were useless. 
</P>
<P>
I was just about to ask Roberto how much he was going to pay us when Miguel 
told me to stop. He began to scream at me and said: "Are you crazy, stupid? Do 
you want to get fired? You never ask how much they are going to pay you. They 
are the ones with the money, not us." 
</P>
<P>
I was impressed by Roberto's home in West Covina. I was sure that it was worth 
half a million dollars. As soon as we arrived, Roberto instructed us on what 
had to be done. He pointed to an area that needed to be leveled and covered by 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
I began by digging a hole about three feet deep and carting away more than 20 
wheelbarrows of dirt. And boy did I have it easy! While I was digging, Miguel 
and Juan carried about 1,000 pounds of cement, which was at the end of a long, 
steep hill. I weigh 145 pounds, and I'm 6 feet tall. I was able to carry only 
one 90-pound bag of cement, and that nearly killed me. 
</P>
<P>
We filled the hole with concrete and I designed a brick pattern for the top of 
the slab. When Roberto saw that we were finished with the project, he checked 
to make sure it was level and had been built properly. He never praised us. All 
he did was point us to where he wanted a gazebo to be built. We laid the 
foundation for it, but quickly ran out of bricks. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to call it a day, so we began to wash our dirty, grayish bodies with 
a water hose nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto called me and said, "Come here" in Spanish. I slowly approached him. He 
then handed me $60. I thought: "Boy, $60. Maybe this guy isn't that bad after 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto then told me to split the $60 with Miguel and Juan. There was a long 
pause. I stared at Roberto and, just as the tears in my eyes were beginning to 
break, I turned away and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
I handed Miguel and Juan their money just as the sun was setting. It was now 7 
p.m. and we were stuck in West Covina. I could not understand why Miguel and 
Juan never complained about the $20 I gave each of them. They just accepted 
that they had been exploited for another day. 
</P>
<P>
We finally found our buses and each went his own way. I had worked for nearly 
13 hours in the smoldering sun. I had $20 in my pocket. I used three of those 
dollars to get back home.

DOROTHY SCHIFF; FORMER PUBLISHER WHO MOLDED N.Y. POST INTO LIBERAL SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who bought and then masterminded the New York Post 
for 37 years, molding it into a showcase of liberal thinking, died of cancer 
Wednesday in her New York City home. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Granddaughter of banking magnate and philanthropist Jacob Henry Schiff, she 
bought the Post in 1939 at the request of her second husband, George Backer, 
and sold it to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch in 1976 for $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Post, sold again to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow last year, was 
begun by Alexander Hamilton in 1801. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid owes its longevity partly to "Dolly" Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survived Strike 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, the Post survived a lengthy strike that spelled the demise of all but 
three New York dailies -- the Post, the Times and the Daily News. Miss Schiff, 
after a punishing 86-day shutdown, broke with her colleagues in the New York 
Publishers' Assn. and resumed publication. 
</P>
<P>
"Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive journalistic 
climate," Newsweek observed, "she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as Hearst's 
Journal-American, Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun, and John Hay 
Whitney's Herald Tribune, and in the end outlasted them." 
</P>
<P>
One of the world's few women to own a newspaper and New York's first woman 
publisher, Miss Schiff was considered a model for the character Margaret 
Pynchon, publisher of the fictional Los Angeles Tribune on the 1977-82 
television drama "Lou Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Although from a traditionally Republican family, Miss Schiff became a New Deal 
Democrat, working for social welfare organizations and befriending Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt. At one point, she persuaded Mrs. Roosevelt to write a column 
for the Post. 
</P>
<P>
Although she publicly denied any romance or affair with the Depression-era 
President, Miss Schiff stated for a 1976 authorized biography called "Men, 
Money and Magic" that F.D.R. "was a warm, sexy guy who was in an isolated 
position and was looking for a turn-on" and "probably saw me as a sex object." 
</P>
<P>
She told the book's author, Jeffrey Potter, that her then-husband Backer was 
"proud" of her seven-year relationship with Roosevelt, which ended in 1943 when 
she decided his "sun-god quality wasn't working for me all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Honest Unionism' 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff described the Post's editorial policy, which created a following in 
New York's liberal middle class, as advocating "honest unionism, social reform 
and humane government programs" and speaking out for "the causes of civil 
rights and civil liberties." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her wealthy family's charitable philanthropies, she embraced New Deal 
programs, commenting: "Taxes seem to me to be far less demoralizing than 
private charities. I am glad to be taxed because it is the least devastating 
way to meet social needs both for the underprivileged and over-privileged." 
</P>
<P>
Her penurious policies with the newspaper were legendary, and the Post became 
known for producing the most with the smallest staff and the most antiquated 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced," she said, "that a newspaper must make its own way. Kept 
organs are just no good." 
</P>
<P>
When the paper suffered financial losses shortly after she bought it, she 
advocated comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. Backer's 
objections led eventually to his replacement on the paper and in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff was born March 11, 1903, in New York City to Mortimer Leo Schiff, 
who was a banking partner of his father in Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., and Adele A. 
Neustadt Schiff. She attended the private Brearley School, but after one year 
at Bryn Mawr College was asked not to return because of her low grades. 
</P>
<P>
She debuted in 1921 and two years later married the first of her four husbands, 
broker Richard B. W. Hall. She divorced him in 1932 and married Backer, a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Miss Schiff divorced Backer, assumed the titles of owner and publisher 
of the Post, and married the career newsman whom she had promoted to the 
paper's executive editor, Theodore Olin Thackrey. 
</P>
<P>
That marriage ended because of political differences stated strongly in print. 
In 1948, the couple both opposed Harry S. Truman as President, but Thackrey 
touted Progressive candidate Henry Wallace and Miss Schiff went with Republican 
Thomas E. Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
"A competent and fairly liberal Republican," she wrote, "will make a better 
President than an incompetent and inconsistent Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
From 1951 to 1958, Miss Schiff wrote a column called "Publisher's Notebook" and 
later "Dear Reader," but told an interviewer: "I write scared, with a 
dictionary beside me." She abandoned the effort as too time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dabbled in Radio Stations 
</P>
<P>
Before buying controlling interest in the Post, Miss Schiff dabbled in radio 
stations in the 1930s -- WLIB in Brooklyn, KMTR in Los Angeles and KYA in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, she married her fourth husband, petroleum executive Rudolf G. 
Sonneborn. That marriage also ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Schiff is survived by a son and daughter from her marriage to Hall, 
Mortimer W. Hall and Adele Hall Sweet, and a daughter from her marriage to 
Backer, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

POWAY ADOPTS LAW TO FORCE EVICTION OF TENANTS WHO DEAL OR USE DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway has become the first city in San Diego County, and perhaps in the nation, 
to pass legislation requiring landlords to evict drug users and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Poway City Atty. Stephen Eckis said Wednesday that the ordinance was patterned 
after Los Angeles statutes approved in April, "but we added users to the 
wording." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles calls for a $5,000 fine if landlords do not act within two weeks to 
start eviction proceedings against reported drug traffickers or users. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway ordinance, which was passed unanimously by the City Council on 
Tuesday night and is up for final approval Sept. 12, specifies that a landlord 
may be charged with a misdemeanor for ignoring the city's orders to evict the 
drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Kimball, attorney for the San Diego Apartment Owners Assn., said the Poway 
ordinance has the full approval of the landlord group and called it "a major 
step" toward formation of a private-public partnership to evict drug 
traffickers from rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway ordinance establishes a "drug dealer removal program" that gives the 
city attorney power to require landlords to evict known drug users and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ordinance, "A landlord shall not cause or permit any rental 
unit to be used or maintained for any drug-related use, illegal drug-dealing 
activity or drug-related nuisance," including possession of a controlled 
substance for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Eckis said the main complaints he has heard about the ordinance is its possible 
preemption of a tenant's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel that we are breaking new ground," Eckis said. "This law simply 
gives the landlords an out, a reason to evict tenants who are dealing in or 
using drugs, even if they are not causing a public nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
However, Eckis said, penalties in the proposed ordinance are directed at the 
landlords, who could face a sentence of up to one year in County Jail and as 
much as $1,000 in fines for ignoring city orders to oust a known drug dealer or 
user. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This May Be the Tool They Need' 
</P>
<P>
"I admit I was surprised that the apartment owners were the driving force 
behind this legislation," Eckis said. "Right now, it is difficult for them to 
get rid of 'bad apples' as tenants, and this may be the tool they need." 
</P>
<P>
Poway Councilman Jan Goldsmith, who proposed the legislation, said that 
currently drug dealers can be arrested, get out on bail and return to their 
rented quarters and continue their illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, law enforcement personnel would inform Poway officials of a 
drug arrest and the city attorney would then notify the landlord to begin 
eviction proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Poway Councilman Bob Emery, though voting for the ordinance, said he had a few 
reservations about whether "a few nice people smoking dope" should be included 
in the ordinance, but he conceded that users "are part of the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
Eckis said he does not expect many recreational drug users to be caught up in 
the enforcement net. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is not a place to take on a major crusade. I'm just a part-time city 
attorney and don't have a huge staff to use in investigations," Eckis said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would not act to order an eviction without "a report, something in 
writing and not just some cop's guess. There's got to be solid evidence to 
proceed." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not specify how serious the offense must be or at what stage 
the eviction process would begin. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants would have their rights protected through the court-eviction process, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball said the San Diego Apartment Assn. and Board of Realtors had formed a 
countywide drug-abatement task force that included elected city and county 
officials to form a coordinated attack against drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith, a member of the task force, said he felt that the city has taken a 
lead in the drug war locally, showing the way to other communities. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we must be careful not to do is put the landlords in untenable 
positions," Goldsmith said. "We want to create a situation of giving 
information to the rental owners on how their properties are being used and 
abused." 
</P>
<P>
At the final reading of the ordinance, Goldsmith expects further testimony on 
the proposal, "and we may wish to change some of the wording based on comments 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Shilling, San Diego deputy city attorney involved in drug abatement, said 
that San Diego is proceeding against both owners and landlords in ousting drug 
dealers from their quarters, using state Health and Safety Code provisions, 
which allow the abatement of public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Bawdyhouse Law' 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is cumbersome, he said, but in recent months, about 30 drug 
houses have been shut down through negotiations with property owners without 
going to court. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' ordinances carry a maximum $5,000 fine for landlords who do not 
act to evict drug traffickers within specified time limits. Artesia and Long 
Beach have also enacted statutes recently in an attempt to give landlords a 
tool to stop drug dealing in rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Mayor Ed Koch recently announced that he would crack down on drug 
trafficking using a 19th-Century law to evict suspected drug dealers from 
rental units, with or without the cooperation of landlords. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "bawdyhouse law" gives city officials and neighbors the right to 
proceed against tenants engaged in "any illegal trade." 
</P>
<P>
California's Legislature is considering a bill that would raise the maximum 
penalty against landlords refusing to act to evict drug traffickers from the 
present limit of $25,000 to a new maximum of $500,000.

APPEAL COURT SLASHES AWARD AGAINST KRISHNAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a long-awaited ruling on religious liberty, a state appeal court in San 
Diego dismissed a claim that the Hare Krishna sect brainwashed a 15-year-old 
Orange County girl and cut by more than two-thirds a $9.7-million verdict 
against the group. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the brainwashing claim, the 4th District Court of Appeal also 
dismissed claims that the Krishnas intentionally caused Robin George emotional 
distress and libeled her. It left her only a $75,000 award tied to the wrongful 
death of her father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freedom of Religion at Issue 
</P>
<P>
However, the court left intact a $2.9-million judgment for Robin's mother, 
Marcia George, for emotional distress and libel. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated case began in 1977 when the George family sued the sect, 
contending that the group had brainwashed Robin into joining the movement, then 
hid her from her parents. The complex lawsuit included claims of libel and 
wrongful death, the latter because stress allegedly brought on the heart attack 
that killed Robin George's father in 1976. In 1983, an Orange County jury 
returned a $32.5-million verdict against the sect, a judgment cut to $9.7 
million by the trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
In their appeal, the Krishnas contended that the verdict interfered with their 
constitutional right to freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on both sides said Wednesday that appeals of the most recent, 
105-page decision are almost certain because neither side can be considered a 
complete winner. 
</P>
<P>
Robin George "got clobbered," said Lynde Selden, a San Diego attorney 
representing the Georges. "And, if anybody was wronged by this Krishna 
behavior, it was Robin. I think her mother agrees. Robin was injured the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
Robin George, now 29 and known by her married name, Robin George Westerkamp, is 
an interior designer living in Orange County. She said the verdict was "sad." 
</P>
<P>
The court apparently didn't understand the "element of mind control and how 
that interferes with your thinking," she said. "The court is looking at this 
case and saying, 'This girl did these things and had a choice -- there must be 
something wrong with her.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Like Joining the Baptist Church' 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't gone through this myself, if I was Joe Average or something, I 
would probably think I didn't deserve anything. But it's not that simple. Not 
like joining the Baptist church. It's a totally different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia George was out of the state Wednesday, her daughter said. She could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Krishnas, including about 35 who had walked to San Diego from San 
Francisco en route to Tijuana to publicize the case, gathered Wednesday 
afternoon at Horton Plaza downtown to celebrate what they called "a victory for 
religious freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"The court was really very wise on that brainwashing fiasco," said Mukunda 
Goswami, a spokesman for the Krishnas, noting that the $9.7-million award would 
have forced the sect to sell six temples -- in San Diego, Los Angeles, Laguna 
Beach, Brooklyn, New Orleans and outside New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to recommend that we take it to the (state) Supreme Court, if for 
no other reason than we don't think the evidence will sustain any of those 
causes of action as to the old lady," said W. Marshall Morgan, the Los Angeles 
attorney who represented the Krishnas, formally known as the International 
Society for Krishna Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney Is Troubled 
</P>
<P>
David A. Niddrie, the San Diego lawyer who helped handle the appeal for the 
Georges, said he had read only parts of the opinion, but said it "troubles me 
in that it gives these types of organizations the opportunity to . . . mistreat 
their own members as long as it doesn't sort of adversely affect the interest 
of people on the outside. I don't think that's the state of the law in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the latest turn in a case that began when Robin George, then a 
15-year-old Cypress teen-ager, ran away from home in November, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
She spent most of the next year in Krishna temples in New Orleans and Ottawa, 
Canada. The following November, she ran away from the Krishnas and returned 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1976, less than four months after she returned home, her father, 
James George, died of a heart attack. The stress caused by his dealings with 
the Krishnas and his inability to locate his daughter for the year she was gone 
"significantly shortened his life," an expert testified at trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Month Trial 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1977, Marcia and Robin George sued the Krishnas in Orange County 
Superior Court, contending that the sect brainwashed Robin and then conspired 
to hide her from her parents. After a five-month trial, a jury returned the 
$32.5-million verdict. Judge James A. Jackman reduced the amount to $9.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego attorney Milton Silverman represented the Georges at trial, but did 
not take part in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The "centerpiece" of the appeal, according to Justice Howard Wiener, who wrote 
the lengthy opinion, was the brainwashing claim. The Georges contended that 
Robin had been brainwashed and could not leave the temples even if she wanted 
to. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1988 ruling from the state Supreme Court -- in a case involving 
the Unification Church -- Robin needed to show that the Krishnas physically 
restrained her from leaving, which they did not, Wiener said. 
</P>
<P>
In that 1988 case, the court dismissed a claim brought by a former church 
member who wanted to leave a retreat but was told that, if she did, she would 
be "damned to hell forever." Such threats alone are "protected religious 
speech," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The George case appears to be the first appellate test after the Unification 
case, attorneys involved said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same as Other Devotees 
</P>
<P>
George's brainwashing theory admittedly focused on more than threats of "divine 
retribution," Wiener said. But imposing liability because of "dietary 
restrictions, methods of worship and communal living arrangements and schedules 
is just as surely inimical to the free exercise of religious liberty as that 
based on threats of divine retribution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a physical threat was not required, George presented no evidence that 
her "schedules, practices and duties" as a Krishna devotee differed from any 
other devotee's, Wiener said. Without that evidence, "Robin's brainwashing 
theory . . . is no more than an attempt to premise tort liability on religious 
practices the Georges find objectionable. Such a result is simply inconsistent 
with the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
The panel dismissed George's claim for emotional distress because many of the 
acts she called "outrageous" are "hardly uncommon" among cloistered religious 
groups, Wiener said. 
</P>
<P>
It also tossed out her libel claim, an element of the case that even the 
attorneys involved said was complex and confusing. It stemmed from a Krishna 
statement distributed to the press at an Oct. 29, 1976, press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said that when George came to the Krishnas, she complained of 
being beaten by her parents. It concluded, "For all we know now, (Robin's) 
accounts of brutality and beatings (by her parents) were exaggerated or totally 
fabricated." 
</P>
<P>
Since the statement included the phrase, For all we know now, it alerted 
readers that the Krishnas were merely expressing their opinion about whether 
Robin was lying when she gave her "supposed earlier accounts of brutality at 
the hands of her parents," Wiener said. Statements of opinion, as opposed to 
fact, cannot support a claim for libel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Expectancy Shortened 
</P>
<P>
The court left untouched only George's $75,000 jury verdict for her father's 
death, finding that his life expectancy was shortened by stress. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia George did not file a wrongful-death claim. But the panel approved of 
the award for her claim for emotional distress, finding the Krishnas had bought 
plane and bus tickets, disguises and fake photographs, among other acts, to 
help hide her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Those actions provide a "more than adequate basis" for concluding that the 
Krishnas engaged in "outrageous conduct," Wiener said.

YOUTH USES A BRUSH TO UNCOVER LATINO EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask 18-year-old Raul Alvizo of Oceanside what it means to be Latino and chances 
are he'll be lost for words. 
</P>
<P>
But he can show you well enough -- with an airbrush, a pencil or a crayon. 
Alvizo is an aspiring artist whose drawings and airbrushed renderings speak 
both to the past and present of the Latino experience. 
</P>
<P>
They include religious images of churches and holy men, historical themes of 
long-lost Indian cultures, all mixed with a dose of modern street life -- jail 
scenes and decked-out home boys doing the downtown strut. 
</P>
<P>
Alvizo's own life could be considered a sketch of one of his works. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 12, his mother decided to take the Los Angeles-born youth, along 
with his two sisters and four brothers, back to the Mexican state of Jalisco 
for four years to establish a better feel for their roots. 
</P>
<P>
Though it prolonged his conventional schooling, the journey proved to be a 
learning experience for the inner-city youth. It colored his work as an artist 
and provided his start. 
</P>
<P>
"A teacher back there asked kids what they wanted to be, and most said doctors 
and lawyers," Alvizo recalled. "I said that was too hard. I wanted to be an 
artist, to draw and create." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Is One Step Closer 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Oceanside High School sophomore is one step closer to showing 
everyone he means business. He was recently announced as one of three 
grand-prize winners in McDonald's restaurant's Hispanic Heritage Art Contest. 
</P>
<P>
His pencil and crayon sketch, titled "The Time," was chosen from 3,500 works 
nationwide as the best expression of the concept "What My Hispanic Heritage 
Means to Me" for seventh- to ninth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, his piece will be among 48 contest semifinalists and grand-prize 
winners to be displayed at the Barnsdall Art Park-Junior Arts Center in Los 
Angeles, as part of a nationwide tour that begins in November. Raul also gets 
to go to Los Angeles, and will receive a plaque this week from his neighborhood 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
"The contest is a way to help kids identify with their Hispanic heritage 
through art," said McDonald's Corp. spokeswoman Susan Bergen in Chicago. "We 
think it's gotten some kids excited about being Hispanic and given them an 
outlet to express that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than just coloring something and putting it up in their classroom. 
You wouldn't believe the color, emotion and feelings expressed in 
</P>
<P>
these works -- to think that a first- or seventh-grader did this." 
</P>
<P>
Alvizo describes his prize-winning entry as a figure of a half-church, 
half-Aztec temple flying a Mexican flag, with a modern street character looking 
up in approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexican people are very religious, that's why I drew that," he said. "And the 
Aztec culture is part of that heritage. But Hispanics in the U. S. are like 
home boys, bad dudes, so I drew one of those to show how we are today." 
</P>
<P>
His impression caught the eye of two Latino artists in Los Angeles who judged 
the contests. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rendered really well; there was lots of interpretive symbolism in the 
piece," said Patssi Valdez, whose work made up the first Hispanic art show to 
tour Europe. "It was one of the stronger pieces that had Latino imagery in it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubles as Baby-Sitter 
</P>
<P>
Alvizo has done much of his work while doubling as baby-sitter for his younger 
siblings. His studio is makeshift -- usually the living room couch with a 
kitchen chair on which to prop his sketch pad. Often, MTV blares nearby. 
</P>
<P>
He heard of the contest when his 9-year-old brother, Josue, brought home an 
announcement from school. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Look, Raul, you should try this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Alvizo had his piece finished. 
</P>
<P>
He likes Picasso, especially the artist's drawings of revolution. 
</P>
<P>
His own work, Alvizo said, attempts to capture the feeling of living an 
inner-city life without male supervision, as he and many of his friends must 
do. Alvizo is being raised by a single parent; his mother, Isabel, works in a 
bullet factory in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard to Be Hispanic' 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Alvizo won fourth place in an art contest at the Del Mar Fair for a 
drawing of a tiger -- to illustrate the strength of Latinos -- and a jail cell 
-- to represent more modern problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it's hard to be Hispanic," he said. "All my friends have problems -- 
their parents don't give much attention to their work or their lives. They all 
have too many kids, so when you try to progress, they can't help you enough." 
</P>
<P>
But that won't stop Alvizo -- because this 18-year-old thinks big. That is 
evident in the intensity in his furrowed brow. 
</P>
<P>
After he saved to buy an airbrush, friends swamped him with requests for 
T-shirt art -- Gothic drawings and racy sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
They have suggested a project to paint a wall mural in downtown Oceanside, he 
said. And, when Alvizo mentions a new magazine he and a friend would like to 
start for Latinos in Carlsbad and Oceanside, he smiles shyly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the beginning," he said. "From there, it could grow and grow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ample Inspiration 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, when he's not in school, Alvizo will be looking for a 
part-time job to save enough money for more art supplies. One day, he'd like to 
rent a garage and start a studio. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life in Oceanside for an underprivileged Latino teen is providing 
ample inspiration. Though he belongs to no gang, Alvizo said, he was struck in 
the head by a gang member with a baseball bat six weeks ago. He plans to put 
that experience into art. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? With continued encouragement from teachers and family members, 
Alvizo's images could one day become synonymous with the Latino condition for 
millions of his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, he has his proteges. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of my brother," said 16-year-old Marla. "Now our younger brothers 
draw, too. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty good. They always follow the stuff Raul does." 
</P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three assailants took over an Escondido home early Wednesday, firing into the 
house as they entered it and then robbing the residents before fleeing in a 
pickup truck belonging to one of the five victims, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido police, 6 1/2 hours after the 4:30 a.m. attack, detained six people 
for questioning, said Lt. Earl Callender. He said the six had not been 
arrested, and he refused to release their names, but the interrogation 
continued late into Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers bound the five residents of the house in the 700 block of West El 
Norte Parkway before leaving with the truck, a rifle, a shotgun, jewelry, a 
stereo and several hundred dollars in cash, according to Callender. 
</P>
<P>
The residents freed themselves and called police. Callender identified two of 
the victims as Bill Savell, 25, and Stephanie Bramhall, 20. Two other roommates 
and a house guest were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
According to Callender, at least one of the assailants knew one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
He said the six people were detained for questioning because one of the victims 
overheard the robbers mentioning a hotel room number. 
</P>
<P>
The six were taken into custody at Best Western Hotel at Del Norte Parkway and 
Interstate 15, Callender said. He refused to say why they were being questioned 
or to provide other details in the case.

<P>
Police Wednesday were investigating eight other possible incidents of child 
molestation that may have been committed by three Linda Vista men already 
accused of molesting an 11-year-old boy, according to a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Fallis, 52, Stephen Brady, 33, and William Huggins, 57, all of the 6500 
block of Lanston Street, were arrested Tuesday, Sgt. George Guevara said. 
</P>
<P>
They were held in the downtown County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail each on 
suspicion of child molestation; using force, fear and intimidation; oral 
copulation; penetration with a foreign object and sexual exploitation, Guevara 
said. They are to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight other parents contacted police about possible abuse involving 
their children after learning of the arrest of the three men, Guevara said. "I 
know there will be . . . some more charges, but I don't know how many," Guevara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated sexually explicit photos of boys when they made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Brady and Fallis worked as private investigators, and Huggins was a 
free-lance photographer.

Swap meet owners Monte and Charlotte Kobey have settled a lawsuit against a 
local hospital and blood bank. 
</P>
<P>
The case charged that the two defendants withheld for six months their 
knowledge that Monte Kobey had been given AIDS-tainted blood, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on all sides said Wednesday that they were pleased with the 
settlement but could not release details because San Diego Superior Court Judge 
James R. Milliken ordered them not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The case was one of the first to involve not an assertion of wrongdoing by a 
blood bank or hospital in collecting blood but a claim that the bank or 
hospital did not properly notify a blood recipient of problems with the blood, 
said Duncan Barr, a San Francisco attorney who represented the San Diego Blood 
Bank in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Kobeys sued the blood bank and Alvarado Hospital Medical Center in August, 
1988, after Monte Kobey was infected with the HIV virus, which causes aids, 
during a blood transfusion. Kobey received the blood during an October, 1984, 
coronary bypass operation at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Kobeys alleged that, in late 1986 or early 1987, the blood bank learned the 
platelets he received were from a donor with AIDS antibodies. Blood bank 
officials sent the hospital a letter in February, 1987, saying the blood Kobey 
received was contaminated, but Kobey didn't learn until six months later that 
he had been infected, the suit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The blood bank began routine AIDS testing of donor blood in March, 1985, about 
six months after Kobey's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Monte nor Charlotte Kobey could be reached Wednesday for comment. 
Charlotte Kobey reportedly has tested negative so far for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The Kobeys operate the giant swap meet at the Sports Arena parking lot.

IMPERSONATING INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1846, midway through his stay at Walden, Henry David Thoreau spent the night 
in jail for refusing to pay his poll tax. He had withheld payment, he said, 
because he could not supporta government that endorsed slavery and waged an 
unjust war against Mexico. Later, in a pairof lectures he delivered to the 
Concord Lyceum, he called what he had done "civil disobedience." 
</P>
<P>
"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly," Thoreau said, "the true 
place for a just man is also a prison." 
</P>
<P>
It is the absence of such moral gravity, the refusal to accept the inextricable 
link between conscience and consequence that makes Operation Rescue's claim to 
share in Thoreau's tradition hollow. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima perceptively cited that fact Tuesday, 
when he found the group in contempt of an injunction against blockading 
California women's clinics. "The essence of civil disobedience is to allow 
yourself to be punished," Tashima said. "To deny responsibility, you become 
nothing more than ordinary lawbreakers . . . . It is simply hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, though its leaders naturally insist otherwise, Operation Rescue is an 
abuse of the heroic moral tradition of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Civil disobedience, particularly in a democracy, is one of the most profound 
acts of personal responsibility an individual can undertake. It deserves to be 
considered legitimate only if it meets one or more tests: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is addressed to a collective social conscience which, either through 
ignorance or denial, has refused to engage the issue at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those who undertake it are otherwise disenfranchised from normal political 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other avenues of orderly, just redress are foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue's leaders claim their actions are sanctioned by the great 
tradition of civil disobedience that begins with Thoreau and runs through 
Gandhi to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. There are, however, profound differences 
among the actions of such men and those OperationRescue has urged on its 
adherents. 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau, for example, confronted an historical situation in which nativist 
bigotry and rabid expansionism had made normative opposition to the Mexican War 
impossible. Gandhi was the disenfranchised colonial subject of an exploitative 
imperialist power. Dr. King faced a society in which Jim Crow had denied black 
people not only political participation but also access to a fair hearing in 
the local courts. 
</P>
<P>
Are any of these historical precedents present in the case of Operation Rescue? 
The answer, clearly, is no. Operation Rescue's leaders contend that is 
irrelevant, since their conduct is justified by what they see as the necessity 
to save lives. Judge Tashima wisely rejected that defense, since it resolves 
the thorny question of when life begins with an answer accessible only through 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the question of abortion, the American conscience has been 
engaged, if conflicted, for more than two decades. The issue has been debated 
up, down and sideways onevery conceivable occasion and on every imaginable 
platform. Everyone who wished to make a moral judgment has had time to form his 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of legal abortion can hardly be said to have been disenfranchised. 
They have made the question an election issue in constituencies at every level; 
people can and have been voted out of office for supporting or opposing a 
woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as the Supreme Court's recent decision in Webster vs. Reproductive 
Services demonstrates, opponents of legal abortion have had complete access to 
thorough, fair court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
If Operation Rescue is not a legitimate exercise of civil disobedience, what is 
it? It is, in fact, a public tantrum by people who seek to win through 
intimidation what they cannot achieve through politics or law. As such, it is 
not an appeal to our collective conscience but an attack on our collective 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an assault on abortion but on the concept of pluralism itself.

PROP. 103 AND ROXANI GILLESPIE

<TEXT>

Roxani Gillespie, California's insurance commissioner, states that it is now "a 
fair prediction that by and large" most Californians are "not going to get 
lower insurance rates." She further states that hearings on the reviews could 
take as long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion for Gillespie: Roll back rates immediately, as mandated by 
a majority of the voters last November, and then proceed with the reviews. If 
the insurance companies win out -- as they most assuredly will with her help -- 
they can then raise their rates in 1999 to make up for the 10 years of 
rollbacks. Meanwhile, the public an enjoy a decade free of usurious insurance 
rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1978, during the campaign for Proposition 13, insurance companies promised 
that if the proposition passed, they would be able to lower rates because of 
the money they saved on property taxes. My rates, as did those of everyone else 
I know, continued to rise. Now, after the passage of Proposition 103, I am told 
that implementation might take 10 years, and some companies will not be 
required to comply at all. Whatever happened to "We The People?"

<P>
Harvey Rosenfield is upset because Gillespie has announced that most of the 
rollbacks promised by Prop. 103 will not be forthcoming because the companies 
are not making that much money. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey does not trust the insurance companies' figures. He claims that they are 
hiding exorbitant profits in their reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies aren't the only businesses that use reserves. They are an 
accounting necessity so that expenses attributable to a particular time period 
are charged against the income for that period. I would like to give a 
simplified version of how reserves work. 
</P>
<P>
If your only asset is your $1,000 paycheck for a month, you could say when you 
get paid that you had a net worth of $1,000. Not so if you have any bills to 
pay. Say that you pay bills you owe of $700. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like that leaves you with a net worth of $300 for the month. However, 
you generally spend $100 for groceries. You have to set up a reserve for that 
$100. That gives you a net worth of only $200. 
</P>
<P>
From past history you know that you average an emergency expenditures of about 
$100 a month. A contingency reserve must be set up for this. This now gives you 
a net worth of $100. 
</P>
<P>
If your calculations are correct, you will end up the month with a net worth of 
$100, not the $1,000 you started with. Insurance companies do the same thing.

PRIORITY FOR TRAUMA CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The message that trauma care is expensive medicine that Los Angeles cannot 
afford to lose seems to have gotten lost in the Legislature's eagerness to use 
Proposition 99 (tobacco tax) revenues to resolve the long-term issues of 
uncompensated care, universal health insurance, workers compensation and the 
skyrocketing costs of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
While negotiations on these global issues have been slowly making progress in 
Sacramento, trauma centers in the South have continued to close their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the combination of state and federal cutbacks, private 
cost-containment efforts and the prohibitive costs of medical care have turned 
the state's medical payment system from "fee-for-service" to "service for 
free." The major consequence has been fewer and fewer providers willing to care 
for a growing number of patients who are unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
While there is still hope for legislative action that will revamp the entire 
public health-care delivery system in California, what is currently being 
proposed may be too little and too late to save our trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 of the trauma centers that have closed in Los Angeles were in non-county 
hospitals. Trauma centers are by their very definition expensive to operate, 
and for private hospitals that receive no public funding, the cost has now 
become prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature staff proposal currently before the Prop. 99 conference 
committee will not guarantee the survival of our remaining trauma care network. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the proposal would spend nearly $83 million on county 
capital outlay projects, and $338 million to cover the costs of uncompensated 
care. Only $30 million is specifically earmarked for private hospitals, and no 
special consideration is given to hospitals operating designated trauma units. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if the people of California voted "Yes" on Prop. 99 because 
county hospitals needed new offices and X-ray machines. I do know that they 
voted "Yes" because trauma centers and emergency rooms were being forced to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Even more egregious is the setting aside of over $30 million for a rainy day. 
For the victims of drunk drivers, gang shoot-outs and heart attacks in Los 
Angeles, it's not raining, it's pouring.

A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 103, for relief from high auto 
insurance rates. However, the insurance commissioner is exempting major 
insurers, at least until the completion of a proposed 10-year study of what 
Voter Revolt's leaders have termed "cooked books." The commissioner and many 
state legislators suggest a "no-fault" alternative, which, however, the 
majority voted down. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 99, taxing our tobacco 
purchases specifically to provide badly needed funds for our state's failing 
system of trauma-care centers. Although the tax has been raised on cigarettes, 
the Governor reshuffled the budget with the result that our hospital systems 
receive little or none of the increased revenue. The sick, injured, and dying 
are shuffled from one emergency room to another all around town. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 65, for controlling our 
exposure to toxic chemicals. However, the Governor exempted all chemicals but 
those found carcinogenic in tests on humans, and labeling on individual 
products, as required by that law, went unenforced. We are told to call "hot 
lines" now found to be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
I love our country, but I understand why most of our citizens do not vote.

WILL COLOMBIA STAND UP TO PARAMILITARY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLETTA YOUNGERS, Coletta Youngers is an associate of the Washington Office 
on Latin America, a nonprofit organization that monitors U.S. foreign policy 
and human rights. She made two trips to Colombia in the last year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan hit a nerve in Colombian society, 
and the courageous response of the people and the government deserves applause. 
For it is political will, not military might, that ultimately will determine 
whether Colombia will rid itself of the cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the murder of Galan, one of the country's most outspoken anti-drug 
politicians, the government has made thousands of arrests and expropriated 
millions in drug-financed property. But the Colombian security forces have yet 
to confront the military arm of the traffickers, the paramilitary structure 
that sustains the political and drug-related violence in the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government, there are more than 140 paramilitary 
organizations, most of which are organized and financed by traffickers. 
Operating like death squads but with the weaponry of mini-armies, they defend 
the drug lords' interests. These extend beyond narcotics to politics. 
</P>
<P>
Rabid anti-communists, the traffickers have united with landowners and other 
traditional elites to protect their common economic interests against guerrilla 
groups and the growing demands for political and economic reforms by poorer 
sectors of the population. Supporting the alliance are members of the Colombian 
security forces who resort to paramilitary activity for profit or out of 
frustration with the inability to win the 30-year battle against guerrilla 
insurgencies. The net result is a "marriage of convenience" in certain areas of 
the country between the traffickers and other landowners and members of the 
military and police forces, all of whom are bent on eliminating "subversive 
elements." 
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary activity stemming from this "marriage" has displaced 
guerrillas from areas where they have enjoyed substantial popular support, such 
as the middle Magdalena agricultural region. However, more often than not, the 
targets of violence are Colombia's growing non-violent progressive forces, such 
as civic movements, peasant and labor unions and a newly formed political 
party, the Patriotic Union. Last year there were 2,738 political 
assassinations, including 82 massacres (killings in groups of four or more 
civilians), the vast majority of which were carried out by death squads or "hit 
men" trained by them. The murder of Sen. Galan was just one of more than 1,000 
political killings this year. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian government investigators and human-rights activists have compiled 
significant evidence implicating members of the military and police in 
paramilitary activity. One of the most highly publicized cases occurred in 
March, 1988, when gunmen raided two banana farms in the Uraba region, killing 
22 union leaders. The investigation by the Colombian equivalent of the FBI led 
to the indictment last September of two well-known drug traffickers, three 
military officials, a police lieutenant, a mayor and others. After presenting 
her report on the massacre, the judge presiding over the case fled the country 
because of death threats. Her father was recently killed, apparently in 
retribution for her brave actions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps evidence such as this provides a clue as to why the Colombian security 
forces have yet to raid the paramilitary organizations' geographical base, 
Puerto Boyaca in the middle Magdalena region. Since Galan's death, there has 
not been one direct confrontation between the military and a paramilitary group 
anywhere in the country, nor have there been any attempts to raid the highly 
publicized paramilitary training schools. In fact, within the range of measures 
being implemented, the paramilitary issue is conspicuously absent. Until the 
paramilitary groups are confronted directly, drug traffickers will continue to 
wage their "total war" on the Colombian government and society. 
</P>
<P>
While the Colombian government's recent efforts to curb drug trafficking must 
be taken in good faith, the Colombian military has yet to show the political 
will to engage in battle with the traffickers' paramilitary arm. The U.S. 
government, having declared a "war on drugs," has steadily militarized its 
anti-narcotics programs overseas and is already providing Colombia with 
significant levels of military assistance under the anti-narcotics rubric. Now 
it is sending $65 million more, along with U.S. military advisers to provide 
"technical assistance." Yet until the Colombian military proves its willingness 
to clean up its own house and to rid the nation of paramilitary violence, such 
aid will only serve to exacerbate domestic political conflict. Ironically, in 
the end it may aid the very forces we are trying to combat.

INGLEWOOD BANS NEW MULTIPLE HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
45-DAY MEASURE LETS CITY STUDY CURBS ON DENSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas from South Bay developers, the Inglewood City Council bowed 
Wednesday to residents' concerns, unanimously approving a 45-day moratorium on 
high-density apartment and condominium developments across the city. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency measure, which became effective immediately, prevents developers 
from submitting new plans in areas zoned for multifamily units but does not 
affect projects already in progress, city officials said. The measure bans 
development in areas zoned for R-3, R-4 and P-1 multifamily housing, about 20% 
of the land in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Study 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium is aimed at giving city officials time to study long-term 
methods of controlling growth in residential neighborhoods, such as zoning 
changes that would impose new restrictions on high-density development. Most 
apartment and condominium construction has been in council Districts 2 and 3 in 
the city's northern and western sections. 
</P>
<P>
"It freezes everything," said Councilman Jose Fernandez, whose District 3 
constituents strongly supported the moratorium. "It gives us time to address 
the issue. Nobody is against development. What we want is balance." 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider new parking restrictions or one-way streets to 
relieve traffic congestion in some neighborhoods. Another possibility will be 
stricter enforcement of building codes that prohibit several families from 
crowding into single-family homes, another factor that city officials said 
contributes to density problems. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Kerry Welsh from Redondo Beach called the moratorium "completely 
illogical" and said its main effect will be to force housing costs up by 
increasing the demand for housing. "The people have a drawbridge mentality," he 
said in an interview. "They want to keep all developers out." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city tightened development standards for multifamily units 
through stricter height, setback and density requirements. But residents 
complain that those measures have failed to prevent developers from buying up 
single-family homes and replacing them with apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood school officials have also blamed the city's development boom for 
severe overcrowding at many schools. To accommodate the new students, dozens of 
portable classrooms have been hauled onto campuses, and school board members 
are considering converting more schools to year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Rises Slightly 
</P>
<P>
Despite a recent boom in apartment and condominium development, the number of 
housing units in Inglewood has risen only slightly since 1980, from 38,225 to 
38,238, as the population has increased from 94,245 to 102,400, said Deputy 
City Manager Lew Pond. He attributed the slow growth in overall housing units 
to Century Freeway construction, which required the demolition of 200 units, 
and two redevelopment projects that are converting land under the flight path 
to Los Angeles International Airport from residential to industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
A lengthy public hearing before the council vote Wednesday became a fiery 
debate. Residents complained about traffic congestion, crime and litter caused 
by packing too many people into too small an area. Developers argued that 
replacing the city's decaying housing stock improved the community's appearance 
and image. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers come in, they throw up some apartments, but they're out of 
here," said Brenda Conyers, a member of the Historical Society of the Centinela 
Valley, who lives in a 70-year-old house in Inglewood that was built by her 
great-grandfather. "They kiss Inglewood goodby. They're in Redondo Beach. 
They're in Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime resident Mildred McNair called on developers to take as much interest 
in the city's social welfare as they do in its economics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Density, Crime Linked 
</P>
<P>
Residents said drug and gang problems thrive in high-density neighborhoods, 
although several developers said they could not understand why residents 
connect new developments with crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs and gangs breed in areas that are dilapidated," said developer Mike 
Walsh of Redondo Beach. "You don't see that in areas like Redondo Beach. You 
see that in areas like Compton." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, who proposed the moratorium earlier this month, 
responded: "We do have a heavy density that is a nesting place for drugs and 
all crime. Armed robbery, drugs, break-ins -- you name it, they are there. My 
constituents are fed up with that." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edward Vincent, who strongly criticized the moratorium when it came 
before the council earlier this month, supported it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"People will feel there's a certain amount of relief," he said in an interview. 
"Apparently they connect crime and gangs with apartment buildings."

TORRANCE TO STUDY CONTROLS ON USE, STORAGE OF TOXICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to study proposed controls 
on the use and storage of acutely hazardous chemicals at more than 100 
companies throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said a series of accidents at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery have 
prompted the city to seek stricter regulations for all companies that use the 
deadly chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Among several proposals discussed during Tuesday's City Council meeting was a 
recommendation by Councilman Tim Mock that would require a city permit for 
companies that use acutely hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 360 chemicals labeled by the state as acutely hazardous, 
according to John Kulluk, the city's hazardous materials analyst. The acutely 
hazardous chemicals most commonly used in Torrance are sulfuric acid, 
hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, companies must report to city and state officials the use and 
storage of such chemicals in quantities of more than 55 gallons of a liquid, 
500 pounds of a solid or 200 cubic feet of a compressed gas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief R. Scott Adams said Torrance has 112 companies that report using 
acutely hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Federal laws also require companies to report the use and storage of acutely 
hazardous chemicals, but the quantity that must be reported varies according to 
the chemical, Kulluk said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest user of acutely hazardous chemicals in Torrance is Mobil, which 
typically has about 29,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid on hand, Kulluk said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over safety at the refinery has been raised by several explosions, 
fires and leaks of hazardous vapors, which have killed three and seriously 
injured more than a dozen since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a brief fire erupted in the coker unit of the refinery, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was reported shortly before 3 p.m., was caused by a crack in a 
fuel line to the coker furnace, according to Fire Battalion Chief William 
Peterson. It was extinguished by 3:30 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker, a vociferous critic of the refinery, noted during the 
council meeting that Mobil had placed an ad in a local newspaper Tuesday 
criticizing the city for failing to support the refinery's plans to hold an 
open house for about 12,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which was addressed "Dear Torrance Neighbors," said: "On August 18th, 
Mobil received a letter from the City of Torrance informing us that we would 
not be allowed to hold an Open House at our refinery. This arbitrary action is 
unfair to Mobil and it is unfair to the citizens of Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
The oil company -- which is being sued by Torrance in an effort to regulate the 
refinery -- was planning to spend up to $200,000 for jugglers, clowns, hot 
dogs, hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, information booths and bus tours 
of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter released earlier this month, the city expressed concern about 
safety at the refinery and suggested that Mobil hold its "public relations" 
events at a large city park. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said the recent fire demonstrates that the city was right not to support 
the open house. "Just as the newspaper (that contained the ad) was hitting the 
front porch, we had another incident at Mobil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Concerns 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Mock said that his proposal to require permits for 
companies using acutely hazardous chemical was prompted by concern over safety 
at the Mobil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Under his proposal, permits would be issued on a case-by-case basis by the 
city's Chemical Review Board, he said. The board, which includes a chemical 
engineer and members of the Fire and the Building and Safety departments, would 
be able to prohibit or set restrictions on the storage and use of acutely 
hazardous chemicals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the Chemical Review Board has met three times since it was 
formed in the late 1960s to consider a request by Hi-Shear Corp. to use 
explosives in its manufacturing process. The board's decisions can be appealed 
to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Mock said his proposal would also allow the board to require some companies to 
prepare a report that assesses the risk of using and storing acutely hazardous 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
During the council meeting, Mayor Katy Geissert expressed concern that the 
permit applications that would need review would overburden the board and the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't there be hundreds of permits?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dee Hardison said the proposal should also regulate the 
transportation of acutely hazardous chemicals. Councilman Bill Applegate asked 
that the staff find out if the state Legislature is considering or has 
considered similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Information Requested 
</P>
<P>
After about 30 minutes of discussion, the City Council voted to have city staff 
study the proposal and return with more information within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected a recommendation to hire a law firm to help the staff 
prepare a permit process and the necessary ordinances.

L.A. RENT DECISION IRKS HORSE CENTER'S OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners' failure to lower 
the rent on the financially troubled Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith 
Park could make it more difficult to sell the center's lease, operators say. 
</P>
<P>
But a park commissioner said Wednesday that lowering the rent would only 
benefit the center's operator, Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, and not the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"Any modification of the existing contract would be a gift, in my mind, of 
public assets. And that is morally wrong," said Commissioner Dominick 
Rubalcava, who voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Rubalcava agreed that lowering the rent would make the center more attractive 
to a buyer. But he said only Gibraltar would profit from such an arrangement. 
"The little guy has to take his lumps . . . and the big guy has to take his 
lumps," Rubalcava said. 
</P>
<P>
The board deadlocked 2 to 2 Monday on Gibraltar's request to reduce the 
center's rent for five years. The proposal would have extended the center's 
20-year lease with the city to 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concessions Needed 
</P>
<P>
Dick Post, Gibraltar senior vice president, said the concessions are needed to 
attract buyers for the 73-acre complex. "Any buyer is going to need the things 
we requested" because "anybody buying the center is going to have to put money 
into it" to make it profitable, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
The equestrian center has been run by Gibraltar, the center's largest creditor, 
since April, 1988, when Gibraltar foreclosed on J. Albert Garcia, the 
facility's previous operator. Since the takeover, the savings and loan has lost 
between $80,000 to $100,000 a month in operating costs, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract provisions would have lowered the center's rent for five 
years, beginning at $50,004 in the first year and increasing to $125,004 in the 
fifth year. At the end of the fifth year, the rent would have been equal to 
5.5% of the center's gross receipts, which were $6.6 million in 1987-88, 
according to city records. Gibraltar pays about $250,000 a year in rent, Post 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely surprised and disappointed" at the board's vote, Post said, 
noting that the commissioners had tentatively approved the rent proposal in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"We had come this far thinking we were going to get approval," Post said. "We 
were caught off guard." 
</P>
<P>
Post said he had not yet discussed the board's vote with Gene Harmon, a 
semi-retired Burbank banker who has expressed interest in buying the center's 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
Harmon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We may talk to the city staff or the city attorney to see if we can present 
this to the commission again or see under what basis it can be reconsidered," 
Post said. "We're still willing to work with the commission, but we really 
don't know if they are willing to work with us." 
</P>
<P>
Park Commissioner Richard J. Riordan, who voted for the rent reduction, said 
Gibraltar should work on a new proposal for the board to consider.

INTERNAL DISCIPLINE BY TORRANCE POLICE EXCELLENT, WITNESS SAYS IN CRASH TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former deputy chief with the Riverside Police Department testified Wednesday 
that the Torrance Police Department conducts excellent internal affairs 
investigations and disciplines its officers appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
Mervin Feinstein rebutted allegations by a San Pedro family in a civil trial in 
Los Angeles Superior Court that Torrance police condone and cover up 
misconduct, particularly incidents linked to excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It just isn't there," Feinstein said of the plaintiffs' case against the 
Torrance police. "There is no widespread cover-up or ratification of employees 
. . . who might not properly record their investigation or report what is going 
on. . . . They don't sweep it under the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called to Testify 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein retired from the Riverside department last year and is now a private 
consultant and administrator with the California Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He was called to testify on behalf of the Torrance Police Department and nine 
officers named in a lawsuit filed in 1984 by John and Geraldine Rastello of San 
Pedro. The Rastellos claim that off-duty Torrance police Sgt. Rollo Green was 
driving drunk and caused the traffic collision that killed their 19-year-old 
son, Kelly. Their lawsuit also alleges that fellow officers covered up for 
Green as part of a pattern of concealing misdeeds by police. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein told the jury that his opinions were based on an impartial review of 
more than 500 internal affairs files from the Torrance Police Department. But, 
during cross-examination, one of the Rastellos' lawyers, Brian Panish, 
attempted to paint Feinstein as a friend of the Torrance police who would never 
take a stand against a fellow officer. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Torrance's own internal affairs investigators defended 
their work under Panish's harsh cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is expected to rest its case today, five years and one day after 
Kelly Rastello died in the collision with Green. Final arguments in the 
5-week-old trial are scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein opened his testimony by criticizing a former Los Angeles Police 
Department deputy chief who was called by the plaintiffs two weeks ago. Lou 
Reiter, the former LAPD official, told the jury that Torrance police received 
little or no punishment for alcohol-related misconduct, creating an atmosphere 
in which excessive drinking was condoned. 
</P>
<P>
Reiter focused on 11 alcohol-related cases in which he said Torrance police 
only once sought criminal charges and only once took a blood-alcohol reading. 
But Feinstein called that information misleading, saying that in most cases the 
Torrance officers were not subject to chemical blood testing because they had 
not been driving. And in many of the cases, criminal charges were not filed 
because the victims did not want to go to court or because the incidents took 
place outside the city's jurisdiction, Feinstein told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation Favored 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Police Department has a wise policy of trying to salvage officers 
involved with alcohol by offering them rehabilitation programs instead of 
suspensions, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was designed to prevent relapses, Feinstein told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But Panish countered that incidents involving Officer Donald Mason show that 
departmental policy is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
While questioning Feinstein, Panish said Mason was told that he could enter an 
alcohol treatment program after he brandished a gun in a bar in 1982. Two years 
later, Mason was reportedly drinking when he crashed into three parked cars as 
he was driving home, Panish said, recounting previous testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Panish also asked Feinstein if he had been told that the Torrance Police 
Department did not adopt a program to assist alcoholics until 1986, a decade 
after most other police departments. Feinstein said he did not know that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crackdown on Drinking 
</P>
<P>
The former Riverside official testified that he did not find an excessive 
number of alcohol-related complaints against Torrance police officers. After 
one 1979 incident, he said, the department cracked down on officers drinking in 
public after hours. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Sgt. Greg Fahnestockand five officers gathered in a parking lot after 
work to drink beer, a custom known in police circles as "choir practice," 
Feinstein testified. He told the jury that the officers continued their 
drinking in the stairway of a public building. "They had an attack of dumb, as 
we say in the business," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said that when Fahnestock received a three-day suspension, it "sent a 
very strong message to younger officers, saying that tenure or rank is not 
going to get you off the hook." The other officers received written reprimands. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the department approved a regulation outlawing choir 
practice, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Toughness 
</P>
<P>
A thorough investigation in another case involving a ranking officer also 
showed the department's toughness, Feinstein said. An internal report showed 
that Lt. Henry Pupkoff took an accident report himself, in violation of 
department policy, after he was involved in a minor collision in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Follow-up investigation by another officer showed that Pupkoff had not 
accurately recorded statements by witnesses to the crash, Feinstein told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was minor enough that it could have been brushed aside, but the 
department chose to perform a full internal investigation, which led to Pupkoff 
being counseled against taking reports in incidents in which he had personal 
involvement, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination by Panish, Feinstein conceded that he cannot recall ever 
testifying against a police officer in a civil case. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein made another concession to the plaintiffs: He said he sees no 
objection to police departments that order officers to take blood-alcohol tests 
when they have been accused of misconduct while drinking. Torrance police 
officials have testified that a policy would violate officers' rights and 
produce test results that would not be admissible in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Torrance Deputy Police Chief Jim Popp resumed the stand Monday to 
continue testimony that began last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Popp said last week that the supervisor of a Police Department program for 
troubled teen-agers had been forced to resign after one of his former clients 
accused him of using drugs and keeping child pornography in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Popp added Monday that the former client also accused Juvenile Deversion 
Program Coordinator Tom Heitmann of sexually molesting him. 
</P>
<P>
When officers searched Heitmann's apartment, they found three or four ounces of 
marijuana and a film of the teen-age boy masturbating, Popp told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Although Heitmann resigned immediately, Popp testified that criminal charges 
could not be filed on the alleged molestation because the three-year statute of 
limitations had expired. In an interview after his testimony, Popp said he does 
not know why criminal drug charges were not filed against Heitmann. 
</P>
<P>
Heitmann did not return several telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
111 Complaints 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, John Rastello's lawyers produced a Police Department report that 
showed discipline was imposed only once as a result of 111 complaints made by 
the public in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Popp conceded that claims against police officers are sustained much more often 
when they are made by fellow officers rather than by private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But Popp testified that the 1984-85 report is deceiving because it does not 
account for officers who were disciplined even before the public filed 
complaints against them.

HAWTHORNE GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO $200-MILLION CLOVERLEAF PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of its effort to revitalize the blighted southwest corner of the city, 
the Hawthorne City Council has unanimously approved plans for a $200-million 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Cloverleaf South Bay Ltd., was given final approval Monday to 
build up to three hotels, 465 condominiums, a retail center, restaurants, a 
child-care center and a health club on a 28-acre site south of Rosecrans Avenue 
and west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The site for the Cloverleaf project is a hodgepodge of land uses, with 25 
residences and about 40 commercial and industrial properties. City officials 
said it will take about a year to acquire the land from 60 property owners in 
the redevelopment area. They said the project is targeted for completion in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Before making their decision, council members listened to more than two hours 
of testimony from about 20 residents, business owners and attorneys 
representing property owners in the project area. About 100 people crowded the 
council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opinions Divided 
</P>
<P>
Testimony on the project was evenly split, with half the speakers saying the 
project will breathe new life into a run-down neighborhood and the other half 
saying it is too dense and will create traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lawson, a resident of the nearby Holly Glen neighborhood, said she 
supports the project because it will improve Hawthorne's image and eliminate an 
area she called an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
But Carol Mayer, another Holly Glen resident, said she has collected signatures 
from about 500 residents who oppose the project because they fear it will cause 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Cormier, assistant director of redevelopment, told the council that the 
Cloverleaf project is a "very well-balanced, mixed-use project" and would have 
an "overwhelmingly positive" effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Income Expected 
</P>
<P>
The project would also be a major source of revenue for the city, he said. The 
developer has been given the option of building either two or three hotels, 
depending on market conditions. If three hotels are built, the city's income 
from hotel and sales taxes is expected to average nearly $1.5 million a year 
during the first five years, according to a city report. With two hotels, the 
annual revenues would be about $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cloverleaf has agreed to pay the city $500,000 for administrative 
costs at a rate of $100,000 per year for five years. Cloverleaf will also 
contribute $1.5 million for improvements in the city's Police and Fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
To acquire the site, Cloverleaf will produce a $46-million letter of credit, 
which the city will use to purchase the properties and relocate businesses and 
residents. Half of that amount will go toward the cost of the site. The other 
half will be returned to the developer through city subsidies of property, 
sales and bed taxes over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to a speaker who accused the city of failing to study all the 
financial and environmental ramifications of the project, Cormier said: "This 
is a solid project. This project has been analyzed upward, downward and 
sideways." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Plans Fell Through 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents fear increased traffic problems, Redevelopment 
Assistant Beth Garrow said in an interview that the Cloverleaf project is 
expected to generate considerably less traffic than two previous proposals for 
the site. The plans by two other developers, which have fallen through for 
various reasons, primarily contained office space and would have created a 
considerable amount of peak-hour traffic, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "urban village" is designed so that people can live, work, shop 
and play in their own neighborhood, keeping them off nearby overburdened 
streets and freeways, she said. In the Cloverleaf project, traffic from 
residents, hotel guests and shoppers would be spread throughout the day, Garrow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the project will increase traffic on adjacent streets by an estimated 
11,820 vehicle trip per day, a city environmental report says. The site 
currently generates about 6,660 trips per day. 
</P>
<P>
Cloverleaf Vice President Rex Swanson said Monday that Cloverleaf has agreed to 
contribute $1.2 million toward traffic mitigation measures, such as widening 
streets and adding turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Tie-Ups 
</P>
<P>
Without such measures, the report said, the project can cause traffic tie-ups 
at the intersections of Rosecrans Avenue and Aviation Boulevard, Aviation and 
Compton boulevards, and Inglewood Avenue and Compton Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The report also studied the impact of several projects within a one-mile 
radius, including the 38-acre Mattel redevelopment project, which would 
increase daily vehicle trips by 17,570. 
</P>
<P>
The Mattel project, which would create 500,000 square feet of office space, 
restaurants, a hotel and retail space on a site next to the San Diego Freeway, 
was challenged last week in a lawsuit by the city of Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that Hawthorne did not properly assess the cumulative 
environmental effects of the Mattel project and other major developments 
planned for the area. Garrow said Lawndale failed to express its concerns 
during the 45 days allotted for responses to the environmental impact report on 
the Mattel project. 
</P>
<P>
However, Garrow said both Lawndale and Hawthorne officials are willing to 
discuss the matter, and she said she hopes the dispute can be settled out of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Monday, the Hawthorne council voted unanimously to rezone 
80 acres near the intersection of the 405 Freeway and Rosecrans, including the 
sites for the Mattel and Cloverleaf projects. The new zoning would allow a 
mixture of commercial and other uses including condominiums, restaurants and 
hotels.

REFINERY THOUGHT TO BE SOURCE OF ODOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foul odor blanketed portions of Lomita, Wilmington and San Pedro on Monday 
morning, prompting 20 residents to complain to air quality officials who said 
they suspect that the smell came from either the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance 
or the Unocal refinery in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"The odor apparently migrated between the two refineries," said David 
Rutherford, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said inspectors could not pinpoint the exact source of the smell. 
But based on wind direction and descriptions provided by residents -- who said, 
among other things, that the air smelled like garlic, cabbage, corned beef, a 
skunk and refinery gases -- Rutherford said inspectors believe the odor was 
that of a sulfur compound released during the refining process. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both refineries said they found no evidence that their plants 
caused the problem.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING MORATORIUM URGED AT HANSEN DAM RECREATION 
AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi on Wednesday called for a 90-day moratorium on 
construction and demolition in the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, which he hopes 
will prevent owners of property near the park's entrance from building an 
auto-repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles wants to acquire the 0.85 of an acre in Lake View 
Terrace for use as a park gateway. A used-car lot and a fast-food restaurant 
now occupy the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything that would be more undesirable than to have that 
kind of auto activity at what should be the key entrance to this recreational 
area," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
A deal to buy the land for $525,000, which was to have come before the City 
Council on Wednesday, fell through unexpectedly when the city discovered that 
the former owner had sold the property in April. The new owner, Hayden 
Hamilton, filed papers with the city zoning administrator's office to begin the 
hearing process Oct. 2 for an 18,000-square-foot auto-repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton paid more for the land than the city's estimated value -- about 
$675,000, according to Bernardi -- and the City Council voted Wednesday to try 
to renegotiate a sale with him. Bernardi said the city will turn to seizing the 
land through eminent domain if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he thought that Hamilton's land was the only parcel that would be 
affected by the moratorium, which is scheduled to be considered Tuesday by the 
council.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOWARD REAPPOINTED TO STATE COASTAL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard has been reappointed to the 12-member 
state Coastal Commission by the state Senate Rules Committee, officials 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The reappointment was effective in May. Howard, 52, was first appointed to the 
commission in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Howard also represents the commission on the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>

CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST BILL CLEARS 1ST COMMITTEE; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS SAY MEASURE WOULD WEAKEN STRICT REGULATIONS FOR OFFICEHOLDERS 
</P>

<P>
A bill carried by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) has cleared 
its first legislative hurdle despite complaints from critics that it would 
undermine state conflict-of-interest regulations for public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under state Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, local officials 
must automatically disqualify themselves from voting on any development within 
300 feet of real estate that they own, including their homes, because of the 
potential for a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sought by the city of Signal Hill, would exempt a public 
official's principal residence from conflict-of-interest requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Governmental Organization Committee approved the measure on an 8-0 
vote and sent it to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Fair Political Practices Commission opposed the legislation as 
too broadly drawn and said it could lead to other changes in the 
conflict-of-interest statutes. Lilly Spitz, a commission lawyer, described the 
potential impact of the bill as "like setting a toe into some quicksand." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether Beverly will have the time to maneuver the measure 
through the legislative process before adjournment. Because the bill would 
amend the state Political Reform Act and Beverly wants it to take effect 
immediately, all action will require a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, whose district covers Signal Hill, said he is pushing the proposal 
partly to spur the commission to reach a compromise with the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Add 1,300 Units to City 
</P>
<P>
He said three of Signal Hill's five council members and two of its planning 
commissioners live near two proposed developments, which would add 1,300 
residential units to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The officials are prohibited from voting on any item affecting the developments 
because of regulations issued last year by the political watchdog agency, 
Beverly said. "Merely by virtue of your residence . . . you should not be 
guilty of a conflict of interest," Beverly told the committee. Because the 
two-square-mile hillside city lies in the middle of an oil field, much of its 
land is undeveloped. The housing developments would take up the bulk of the 
remaining vacant land in the city of 8,400. 
</P>
<P>
John Larson, Fair Political Practices Commission chairman, told the committee 
that the commission has spelled out procedures for cities to handle such 
extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Signal Hill City Council may conduct a random drawing among the 
trio of council members who were disqualified. Along with the remaining two 
members, the person whose name is drawn would make up a quorum of the council 
to review the development projects, according to an analysis of the bill by the 
Governmental Organization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee analysis of the bill, Signal Hill officials say 
other communities are also penalized by the regulations "because it is 
difficult for a locally elected official to avoid conflicts no matter where he 
resides in the city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had to Disqualify Selves 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the commission determined that three planning commissioners and two 
council members in Monterey Park had to disqualify themselves from major zoning 
changes because their homes fell within areas under review or in close 
proximity to them. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said he was in sympathy with Signal Hill's dilemma, but he maintained 
that the dispute could be resolved through changes in his commission's 
regulations or through a narrowly tailored bill to lift conflict-of-interest 
restrictions for officials in small cities like Signal Hill.

ROLLING HILLS CONSIDERS MOVIE-MAKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council is considering adopting an ordinance that would 
prohibit commercial film making in the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff was ordered Tuesday to prepare a proposed ordinance in the wake 
of recent complaints from residents that the filming of a television movie 
created traffic and noise problems. Residents also complained about filming at 
night in the city, which restricts lighting. One resident said the film 
company, which was filming at a vacant house, cut some vegetation on her 
property to improve the view. 
</P>
<P>
Filming took place over a 10-day period on Eastfield Drive, one of three main 
access roads to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Terrence Belanger said in a telephone interview that Sapphire 
Productions gained access to the city with a pass issued by the Rolling Hills 
Community Assn., which controls the private streets. Tom Boyd, president of the 
association, said the group was unaware of how much time filming would take 
when it issued the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Belanger said the city, which is entirely residential, does not restrict film 
making but does prohibit other commercial activities. 
</P>
<P>
The ctaff presented an ordinance used by other California cities to restrict 
filming. But rather than adopt that ordinance and possibly add more restrictive 
measures, the council asked the staff to determine whether film making can be 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stop it, boy, more power to us," Councilwoman Jody Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will report on the proposed ordinance at the next City Council 
meeting Sept. 11.

PRESS TRIES TO RETAIN LEAD IN SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>

<P>
The NASCAR Southwest Tour, one of the most competitive auto racing series 
around, opens a two-week stay in Southern California Saturday with a 100-lap 
event on the quarter-mile oval at the Orange Show Fairgrounds in San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's race will be the 15th in the 20-race All-American Challenge 
Series, and once again the championship figures to go down to the final event 
at Phoenix Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday night, Troy Beebe of Modesto scored his first victory of the 
season, passing fellow Modesto driver Harry Belletto on the 97th of 100 laps. 
He became the fifth driver to win in as many races. Only Dan Press of Frazier 
Park, the series leader, has won more than once in the last eight races, going 
back to May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe's margin over Belletto, who led the first 96 laps, was one second, the 
widest in the last four races, since the others all had been a car-length or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Belletto barely held off a charging Press, who came back from an early spin, 
but had to settle for third. M.K. Kanke of Granada Hills, the only driver in 
top six in the standings without a victory, finished fourth. Earlier Kanke set 
the fastest qualifying time. 
</P>
<P>
Press' third-place finish enabled him to increase his lead in the standings to 
128 points over Kanke, but Beebe, fourth and closing, trimmed the margin 
between himself and Press to 140 points with six events left. 
</P>
<P>
"(The win) gave us a few more points and we are just going to hang in there for 
the championship," said Beebe, 27, who was the Southwest Tour runner-up last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 races, Press has 2,155 points, followed by Kanke at 2,027, Mike Chase 
of Bakersfield at 2,017, Beebe at 2,015 and Palmdale's Ray Hooper Jr. at 1,960. 
</P>
<P>
After San Bernardino, the tour moves to the one-third mile Saugus Speedway on 
Sept. 9 for another 100-lapper. 
</P>
<P>
MORE STOCK CARS -- It is almost certain that the Ed Hale-Tobin Whitt battle for 
the 1989 sportsman championship will go down to the final race on Sept. 23. 
Going into Saturday night's event at San Bernardino, Whitt has a two-point 
margin over Hale. Street, pony and bomber cars also are on the program. . . . A 
40-lap event for sportsman car headlines Saturday night's racing at Saugus. 
Street stock oval and Figure 8 and jalopies will also race. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot Park will feature a 150-lap enduro for domestic and foreign compact cars, 
and the Outlaw mini-stocks will compete in a 20-lap main event. On Monday 
night, Curb Motorsports NASCAR Winston Racing series continues with Marcus 
Mallet trying to his second straight pro stock victory. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday Mallet quickly put away Jim Pettit of Seaside, Calif., then held 
off Jerry Meyer for the 30-lap win. Pettit, who was running second when he 
dropped out with three laps to go, also dropped from the top spot in the NASCAR 
Pacific Region standings, being replaced by Jeff Silva of Aptos, Calif. Bomber 
oval and Figure 8 cars also compete on the holiday program that will capped by 
the final demolition derby of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Street and mini-stocks return at Ventura Raceway Friday night after a 
three-week layoff for the Ventura County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., defending California Racing Assn. 
champion who had both bad and good luck last weekend, is hoping for more of the 
latter this weekend. The sprinters will compete Saturday night at Ascot, then 
Sunday and Monday evenings on Shuman's home track, Manzanita Speedway in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday night at Ascot, three separate wrecks left only nine cars running 
and Shuman with a straightaway lead and only a few laps to go. But suddenly he 
found himself without power and John Redican went on to the victory. The long 
night of crashes also caused him to miss his 11:15 p.m. flight to Indianapolis, 
where he was going to sub for injured Gary Bettenhausen in the USAC dirt car 
Hoosier Hundred at the Indianapolis Fairgrounds. With a fresh start in the 
morning, he made it in time to qualify and finish third in the race after 
leading from laps 14-41. Jack Hewitt won with Johnny Parsons second. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 10 drivers who were involved in the unintentional destruction derby 
last week are expected back this weekend. Series leader Jerry Meyer, who jumped 
into his own No. 28 car after having his regular Bruce Bromme mount sidelined 
in one of the crashes, managed to finish seventh and currently leads Shuman, 
3,156 points to 3,046, heading into the three-race weekend. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Phil Collins, the transplanted Briton, will try to keep his hot 
streak sizzling at Ascot Park's South Bay Speedway tonight when he shoots for 
his sixth straight win in the final event before next Thursday's U.S. National 
qualifying meet. With four of the six qualifiers out of the way, Collins is 
third behind Bobby Schwartz and Steve Lucero but his hot riding at South Bay 
could give him the edge as he attempts to become the first British rider to win 
the U.S. title. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway racing is also scheduled at Orange Country Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa 
on Friday night and at Speedway U.S.A. in Victorville on Saturday evening. The 
final U.S. qualifier will be held on Sept. 8 at Costa Mesa and it will set the 
field for the Oct. 7 championships, also at Costa Mesa. . . . The Continental 
Motosports Club holds its weekly races Friday night at Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Johnson of El Cajon, Ron Stanton of Sherwood, Mich., and Jeff Ward of San 
Juan Capistrano will carry the American colors as the United States seeks an 
unprecedented ninth straight victory in the Motocross des Nations Oct. 10 in 
Gaildorf, West Germany. Johnson will ride a 125cc Honda, his teammate Stanton 
will be on a 250cc machine, and Ward, on a Kawasaki, will be the U.S. entrant 
in the 500cc event. 
</P>
<P>
SPEED TRIALS -- Three drivers bettered world records in the recent 
rain-shortened Southern California Timing Assn. speed trials at Bonneville Salt 
Flats in Utah. Howard Nafzger of Tucson erased a 50-year-old mark when he rode 
his Kawasaki-powered streamliner through the measured mile at 241.740 m.p.h. 
The old mark, 203.500 m.p.h., was set in 1939 by Maj. Goldie Gardner. Jack 
Dolan of San Diego drove his 1975 Buick V-6 at 199.628, eclipsing the mark of 
171.110 set by the late Al Holbert, and Gordon White of Alexandria, Va., 
clocked 153.198 m.p.h. in a 1948 Kurtis midget powered by an Offenhauser 
engine, beating the record of 145.885 by J. Bearce in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Fastest speed of the meet, which was cut to four days by heavy rain, was 
367.833 by Nolen White of San Diego in a Chevy-powered streamliner, one of 
several cars attempting to better the 409.27 set in 1965 by Bob Summers of 
Ontario, Calif. Some of the streamliners will return to the salt flats for the 
third annual World of Speed, Sept. 29-Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's Western States series continues 
Saturday night when Robby Flock, Sleepy Tripp and Co. invade the quarter-mile 
Silver State Raceway in Carson City, Nev. A 30-lap main event tops the program. 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY FARE -- On the last holiday weekend of the summer, all three major 
series in the country will provide racing action. The NASCAR Winston Cup 
drivers are at Darlington, S.C., where Darrell Waltrip will get a 
million-dollar bonus if he wins the Southern 500 Sunday. The CART Indy cars 
compete at Mid-Ohio Raceway in Hilliard, Ohio, in the Red Roofs Inn 200 on 
Sunday, and the Camel GT sports cars of the International Motor Sports Assn. 
will compete in the Nissan Grand Prix of San Antonio, also on Sunday.

LONG BEACH 49ERS HAVE IMPROVED TEAM AND ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two lean seasons, the Cal State Long Beach football team, which begins 
its 1989 schedule against Cal State Northridge at noon Saturday at Veterans 
Stadium, is hoping to regain respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good-looking athletes now," Athletic Director Corey Johnson said 
while watching a recent practice. "Before, we had guys who didn't look good in 
uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
It has taken until now for the 49ers to recover from the crisis of late 1986 
when the university almost dropped football because of money problems. The 
effect that had on recruiting was reflected in the overall records of 4-7 in 
1987 and 3-9 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been rough," said Larry Reisbig, 48, who is starting his third season as 
49er coach. "I knew three years ago it was going to take a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
But fund-raising efforts by the 49er Athletic Foundation have put football back 
on stable financial ground, Johnson said. The foundation has raised about 
$800,000 in the last two years, which has increased football scholarships to 
70, 20 more than in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The team appears to finally have decent depth, and Reisbig said that for the 
first time since he has been coach he is being contacted by players who want to 
transfer to Long Beach. "Everything is positive now," he said. "We're 
competitive, we're going to scare a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the new atmosphere and 11 returning starters, the 49ers have been 
picked by Big West Conferences coaches to finish sixth in the eight-team 
league. They tied for fifth last year with a 3-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
But because the Big West, with the exception of Fresno State, is composed of 
some of the weakest teams in Division I-A, even a little improvement could make 
most of the teams contenders for second place behind Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s the 49ers have had three outstanding quarterbacks -- Todd Dillon, 
Doug Gaynor and Jeff Graham. This season they will have untested senior Paul 
Oates, who as Graham's backup played in just seven games the last three years, 
throwing 29 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Oates, 24, is a left-hander from Granada Hills and a former minor league 
baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Oates is going to make us exciting," Reisbig said. "He has a quick, 
strong arm and is a good leader." 
</P>
<P>
Oates, whose passes are sometimes too hard for his receivers to handle, has 
waited patiently for this chance. He is confident but says, "The first few 
games I should have some jitters." 
</P>
<P>
He will work behind an offensive line that could be one of the team's 
strengths. It includes 6-foot-5, 290-pound Dave McKinnon and 6-5, 300-pound 
Cornelius Harrell, both seniors. McKinnon was second-team all-Big West last 
season and Harrell won honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
The top receiver is Derek Washington, who caught 48 passes for 752 yards last 
year. His 105 career receptions rank seventh in 49er history. Another target 
for Oates will be Kelly Ryan, who averaged 12 yards on 23 catches last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Seay, who caught 31 passes for 480 yards last year as a sophomore, may 
not be with the team. Seay, who lost a kidney when he was shot during a 
children's party last Halloween, was declared medically ineligible in July. He 
has sued CSULB in an effort to resume his career, but Sept. 11 is the earliest 
that there could be a decision in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Southerland, the leading rusher last year, is not expected to play 
because of nerve damage in his shoulder. His replacement at tailback will 
likely by Freddie Leslie Jr., a transfer from Los Angeles Southwest Community 
College. Jeff Fassett, a hard runner from San Jacinto Junior College, has been 
impressive in practice. 
</P>
<P>
The fullbacks will be Jim Bittner, who played in eight games last year, and 
Herman Nash, who was Pasadena City College's most valuable player in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Graham, who threw for 2,720 yards, the 49ers averaged only 16.8 
points a game in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And they gave up 32 a game, mainly, said defensive coordinator Ken Visser, 
because of a line that was the weakest at the school in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Visser has changed the defensive alignment from a 3-4 to a 4-3 in hopes of 
getting a better pass rush. To strengthen the line, he moved 6-4, 240-pound 
linebacker Pepper Jenkins, an aggressive pass rusher, to end. Jenkins joins two 
veterans, 6-3, 250-pound Lemuel Hawkins and 6-3, 245-pound Richard Hensley. A 
promising newcomer is Raul Garcia, a transfer from Cerritos College. However, 
there is a big problem: The status of Dan Duffy, who made 65 tackles last year 
and was second-team all-Big West, is uncertain. He is seeking reinstatement 
after being disqualified academically last spring. 
</P>
<P>
If the defense is to regain the prestige it had several years ago, the linemen 
must come through, Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
At inside linebacker, the 49ers have Mark Ziegenhagen, who had 63 tackles last 
year and Gene Lemmers, who had 28. Outside linebackers will be Pat Workun, a 
redshirt last year, and Greg Hollins, a transfer from San Diego City College. 
</P>
<P>
The defensive backfield includes veterans Marc Tourville, Keith Washington, 
Stan Davis and Leon Patterson. Contending for Tourville's free safety job is 
Jay Carballo, the shortstop on the 49er baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The punter will be Fred Morales, a newcomer from DeAnza Junior College in 
Cupertino. Reisbig said that junior Rick Schwendinger will be the place-kicker 
in Saturday's opener. Leo Rowland, a transfer from Diablo Valley Junior 
College, had been recruited for that job but he injured his back. 
</P>
<P>
Reisbig is happy he won't have to play Oregon and UCLA back-to-back this 
season. Last year the 49ers lost to Oregon, 49-0, and to UCLA, 56-3, on 
successive weeks. Long Beach will play at Oregon Oct. 28, but UCLA isn't on the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Only four of the 49ers' 12 games will be played at home, one more than last 
year when the average attendance at Veterans Stadium was only 5,209. An 
improved team will not necessarily mean improved home attendance, which, has 
been poor throughout the '80s. And the outlook for this season, despite the 
high hopes, does not look much improved -- a university official said about 325 
season tickets have been sold.

DOUBLE-TEAMING PUMP TWINS RUN VIBRANT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
You're a college basketball coach and you've just been cornered by a precocious 
kid with a nonstop rap. You listen for 10 minutes as he explains how to defense 
Michael Jordan. Then you excuse yourself. But halfway across the hotel lobby, 
you bump into the kid again. While you wonder how he caught up so quickly, 
another one suddenly appears, an exact replica: the same frizzy, close-cropped 
red hair, the same beefy forearms, the same overabundance of freckles, the same 
machine-gun, in-your-face oratory. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? You're being double-teamed by the Pump Twins, Dana and David 
of Northridge, natural-born schmoozers who were familiar faces -- or face -- at 
basketball clinics, tournaments and conventions long before they began to 
shave. Now only 22, they've been running a summer basketball camp for six 
years, using high school and college coaches old enough to be their father. Two 
years ago, they started a high school scouting service that now has 150 
subscribers. Their management style: energy, intensity and doggedness. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the most aggressive young people I've ever seen," says Sonny Vaccaro, 
who oversees Nike's basketball promotions and is a powerful force in college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Vaccaro had the double-team experience when he first met the Pumps a few years 
ago. He ran into David on the East Coast. He flew to the West Coast and ran 
into Dana. Or maybe it was the other way around. Regardless, they were 
relentless, all over him like a pair of arm-waving Michael Coopers. "They're 
almost omnipresent," Vaccaro says. "I can't tell them apart. So I just call 
them the Pumpers." 
</P>
<P>
While their personas overwhelmed him, he befriended the likable kids -- taking 
them out to dinner with other coaches, welcoming them into the fraternity -- 
and their ability impressed him. "I wouldn't be surprised to see them running 
the whole scouting service for the NBA one of these days," says Vaccaro, who 
founded the Dapper Dan Classic, the premier all-star game for high school 
players, 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Pumps also have their own all-star game, the Dana Pump Discovery Classic in 
the spring. Dana, an assistant coach at Valley College, puts his name on the 
all-star game and the camp and David operates the scouting service. That's to 
satisfy the NCAA, which considers dual ownership a conflict of interest. But 
the Pumps are such Xeroxes of one another (their phone voices are 
indistinguishable), it would be practically impossible to know which Pump is 
doing what. Even Dana admits: 
</P>
<P>
"David can't be involved in the camp, but who can really tell?" 
</P>
<P>
On this day recently, the only way to distinguish the brothers is by the color 
of their shirts: Dana in white, David aqua. Both are running around at the 
camp, which took place for five days on the wooded grounds of Campbell Hall 
High in Studio City. When they started in 1984 at Northridge Park -- on $1,000 
earned doing odd jobs -- the Pumps had 37 kids, some older than themselves; 
this year: about 200 boys from 7 to 17 and four girls. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing back then," David says, "was 'Who is Dana Pump?' We had to 
build a name. Parents don't send kids to any camp." 
</P>
<P>
From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., the two indoor gyms and four outdoor courts at Campbell 
Hall are a sea of basketballs. Tall men teaching small boys the fundamentals. 
Drills on footwork and fast breaks. This isn't a camp where kids make lanyards 
and take nature hikes. It's strictly hoops. A staff of 25 -- including 
assistant coaches from 15 Division I colleges -- stands beneath towering 
eucalyptus trees and "builds habit patterns," says Mike Dunlap, the new head 
coach at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Pump is constantly on the move, carrying a bundle of papers as he circles 
the camp. David mostly observes. Mostly, that is, until his brother barks, "I 
want two more trash cans put out. And get some more Gatorade." Then Dana goes 
off to find a Band-Aid for a kid's blister. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our top 15 players can go against any camp in California," David says 
after hauling a trash can. "Our younger kids are the most phenomenal I've ever 
seen. We've got this 6-8 eighth-grader, Alex Lopez from Granada Hills, and 
Tracy Murray's little brother. A kid and his father even drove out from Vegas 
to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, about 10 alumni have gone on to major colleges, including 
Adonis Jordan at Kansas and Mitchell Butler at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Pumps may eventually get rich from basketball, but right now they still 
have to live at their parents' home. "We've never made any substantial amount 
of money on the camps," says David, whose father owns a wrecking company. They 
only charge $110 -- compared to about $500 for Magic Johnson's camp -- and let 
about half of the kids in free, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very good to kids from depressed areas," says William Borders, 
who brought 11 players from the Compton area and took off a week from work as a 
recreation director to help coach at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Dana checks his digital watch -- the one that stores 50 phone numbers -- and 
trots over to a court. Youngsters are simulating game conditions under the 
watchful gaze of 6-8 Mel Braxton, a former Long Beach State player. "You know 
how hard it is to motivate little kids like these?" Pump asks. "Their attention 
span is two seconds. But Mel is on them. He's been my director for five years. 
We played against each other in intramurals at College of the Canyons. I killed 
him. Isn't that right, Mel?" 
</P>
<P>
Braxton rolls his eyes. "Yeah, right," he says sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Pump sees an 11-year-old boy with braces. "This kid's been to five basketball 
camps this summer. Five camps," Dana says in disbelief. True, Noel Bloom, who 
lives in Hidden Hills, has already attended Magic's camp, USC's, Michael 
Cooper's and Pat Riley's. He probably acquired enough basketball wisdom this 
summer to coach the Clippers. So how does he rate the camps? 
</P>
<P>
"Magic's was very good," Bloom says enthusiastically. "It was a sleep-over camp 
and they worked you very hard. USC's was a lot like this camp: work stations in 
the morning, games in the afternoon. Michael Cooper's was very good. He 
stressed defense for the first few days. Pat Riley's camp?" He shook his head. 
"I've been going there for four years. How many times can you listen to the 
same stories? Like the joke about the window-washer." 
</P>
<P>
(The window-washer joke, which has nothing to do with voyeurism, is too long to 
repeat, but it's basically a parable about believing in yourself.) 
</P>
<P>
What about Pump's camp? "I love this camp," Bloom says. "I'd call it pretty 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Weiner has another name for it: "a family-operated y'all-come-camp," she 
says, referring to the twins' penchant for letting kids in at no charge. As 
their business partner, Weiner, who has a law degree, has to cope with their 
largess. In 1987, she and the Pumps incorporated as Double Pump, Inc. She 
provides the business savvy and keeps them focused. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deal: I don't coach and they don't write checks," says Weiner, a 
42-year-old Tarzana divorcee who met the Pumps a few years ago when they 
coached her son's flag football team. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner serves $1-a-slice pizza to the hungry kids at the camp, but her main 
responsibility at Double Pump, Inc., is the twins' scouting service, the 
twice-monthly (during the season) California Cage Report. The Pumps come up 
with the information "and I put it together," she says. It contains the 
standard information on a high school prospect plus his or her phone number, 
grade-point average, SAT scores and an analysis by the Pumps. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers are basketball junkies, hooked since age 10 or 11 (as babies, they 
double-dribbled). "We love basketball," David says. "We could watch it 365 days 
a year." They almost do. Over a year, they see hundreds of high school games. 
During the season, they watch at least two or three a day. But in the summer, 
when basketball camps sprout like mushrooms, they go into a feeding frenzy. 
Last July, Dana saw more than 250 games at all-star camps. "Basketball is all I 
do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Starters at Bel-Air Prep -- "5-10 power forwards," is how David describes them 
-- they both made all-league. But their biggest honor, David says coyly, is 
"making the all-lobby team" at the NCAA Final Four. They have been to the past 
four tournaments, working the hotel crowds like seasoned pros, going to dinner 
with big-time head coaches (at one memorable gathering were Jerry Tarkanian, P. 
J. Carlesimo and Lute Olson). 
</P>
<P>
Without question, the brothers say, the novelty of being red-headed twins has 
helped them in the basketball world. "Everybody knows us," David says. But 
their willingness to work hard also has paid off. The first of dozens of calls 
from college coaches and recruiters comes in about 6:30 a.m. It's not until 2 
a.m. that the twins finally get to sleep. They also have to juggle their 
business with a full load of classes at Cal State Northridge. Seniors, they're 
majoring in commercial recreation, which teaches them, among other things, how 
to run a camp. 
</P>
<P>
During this summer's camp, the twins' professor in the Department of Leisure 
Studies and Recreation, Bob Winslow, paid a visit to Campbell Hall to check up 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely is impressive," he says, gazing at the flurry of organized 
activity, watching Dana hustle to keep everything on schedule. At CSUN, Winslow 
had given the twins Bs in "Introduction to Recreation Program Planning," but 
they evidently paid more attention in class than he had thought. "School is not 
their main interest," he says. "This is."

CSUN WOMEN AGAIN FIELD SOLID VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been said that a setter is to a volleyball team what a quarterback is to 
a football team. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Ker, who is in his 11th season as women's volleyball coach at Cal State 
Northridge, fails to see the similarity. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say that," Ker said, "but a quarterback has 10 other players to 
help him. A setter has five, and they touch the ball on every rally and in a 
more significant fashion than a quarterback does." 
</P>
<P>
A better analogy, Ker says, can be made by comparing a setter to a quarterback 
who throws a pass on every down. Even if the completion percentage is high, 
just a few mistakes -- say, four interceptions in 50 passes -- might well lead 
to a loss. 
</P>
<P>
In short, there is little margin for error. Which is why, until the past week 
or so, Ker was circumspect in his comments on the likelihood of Northridge 
earning another trip to the NCAA Division II Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
When Northridge opened practice two weeks ago, there were a trio of candidates 
to replace Karen Langston, a second-team All-American who completed her 
eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
The most experienced of the three, at least from a collegiate standpoint, is 
Karen Scholl, a junior who was Langston's understudy last season. The other two 
are freshmen -- Alison Wool from Wilcox High in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Nathalie 
Zodan from University High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all legitimate candidates," Ker said. "And they all have different 
strengths. Nathalie is probably the best as a front-line player because of her 
blocking and jumping ability. She's six feet tall, which is a real asset. 
</P>
<P>
"Alison, as a pure setter, is probably a little bit ahead of them right now. 
And (Karen) has the experience factor going. She's been here." 
</P>
<P>
And the winner is . . . so far, Wool, who will be in the starting lineup when 
Northridge faces an alumni team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first day of camp she came in real polished as far as getting the 
ball into an attackable area, which is the setter's No. 1 job," Ker said of 
Wool. "She's real bright -- she had a 3.96 grade-point average coming out of 
high school -- so she's been able to assimilate the situation real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Wool is one of six freshmen on the Northridge roster. At least one other, Patty 
Fitzsimmons, an outside hitter, should make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons was the object of Ker's biggest recruiting coup of last season. She 
was listed among one national magazine's "Fabulous 50" high school players. 
</P>
<P>
A middle hitter at Fremont High in Sunnyvale, Fitzsimmons has adjusted quickly 
to her new position. "She's been one of our top back-row players since the 
beginning of camp," Ker said. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which has finished no worse than third nationally in the past 
decade, welcomes back four starters from a team that finished second in the 
nation, 33-12 overall and 11-1 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle will be the twin towers, Kathleen and Marianne Dixon. Kathleen 
(6-1) was a first-team All-American last season. Marianne (6-0) was a 
second-team selection. CSUN is also strong from the outside hitting positions 
with seniors Allisa Evans and Keira Middleton and sophomore Connie Noe. 
</P>
<P>
Ker, therefore, sees no reason why Northridge can't end the '80s in the same 
fashion it started the decade -- as a national champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence in the '80s is going to be our theme for the year," said Ker, who 
has a 302-94 record and three national titles to his credit. "We've been very 
successful, so we'd like to go out a winner."

DIGEST: MASTER'S LANDS GREER FOR MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damon Greer, a former Cleveland High guard, has enrolled at The Master's 
College and will be eligible to play basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Greer was one of 10 San Jose State players who quit the team last season to 
protest what they considered unfair treatment by Coach Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Dedan Thomas, an All-Valley point guard at Taft High last year, has enrolled at 
Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas signed a letter of intent with UNLV but enrolled at Antelope Valley last 
week when he failed to meet the core-curriculum requirements of the NCAA's 
Proposition 48. He is expected to attend UNLV next season. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Piri, the leading scorer for the Cal State Northridge soccer team last 
season, is expected to miss Saturday night's exhibition match against USC 
because of a pulled groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Piri, who had a team-high 12 goals and 31 points as a freshman, did not play in 
Saturday's 2-1 exhibition loss to UCLA at North Campus Stadium after suffering 
the injury during Friday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing serious," Coach Marwan Ass'ad said. "But we don't want to take a 
chance on anything this early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Huff, an offensive lineman at Pierce College, will undergo surgery later 
this week to repair a chronically dislocated shoulder and will not play this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Huff (6-foot-2, 240 pounds), projected as the starting center, will be replaced 
by tackle Darren Spence (6-2, 280). 
</P>
<P>
Warren Johnson (6-2, 240), Myron Prouche (6-1, 260) and Bobby Kyman (6-5, 235) 
will compete for Spence's vacated position.

FEEDING FRENZY BY CSUN'S 'JAWS' PRECLUDES DESSERT OF WIND SPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times staff writers Mike Hiserman, Brendan Healey and John Ortega 
contributed to this notebook. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Cal State Northridge football team did their best during the 
team's annual feast at Rosie's Barbecue and Grillery on Tuesday to replenish 
whatever weight was lost in twice-a-day practices. 
</P>
<P>
More than 350 pounds of beef ribs, two gallons of baked beans, two gallons of 
coleslaw and 15 gallons of lemonade were consumed by Matadors players as they 
made the most of the restaurant's hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the afternoon's meal -- which took place less than three hours 
before a scheduled night workout -- was a rib-eating contest between selected 
players and assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Whitley, a 6-foot-4, 265-pound offensive guard, was the winner, scarfing 
19 ribs in 10 minutes. Whitley's nickname is, appropriately, "Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
But the judging caused some controversy. Scott Norton, CSUN's first-year 
running backs coach, claimed he had eaten 22 ribs. He was credited with only 
12. 
</P>
<P>
"I got short-bucketed," Norton said. "I was too busy pounding to notice, but 
they took some of my ribs and put them in Jaws' pile so they didn't have to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Had either Norton or Doug Block, another assistant, won the contest, the 
players would have been given additional wind sprints after Tuesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, a hefty former Olympic wrestler, was adamant that the extra legwork 
should be added anyway, but he seemed even more concerned that his reputation 
as a chow hound had been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get to be 270 (pounds) by sucking on 12 ribs," he grumbled afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Tee time: A new NCAA rule prohibiting tees for field-goal attempts places 
college kickers in the same situation as their professional counterparts. This 
means that the number of long field goals will decrease, correct? 
</P>
<P>
Not so, according to Abo Velasco, a junior in his third season as Northridge's 
kicker. "The distance is a mental thing," Velasco said. "I think it's because 
of the fact your foot drags a little in the follow-through." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco reports little change in the distance the ball travels, and only a 
moderate change in accuracy. If anything, Velasco says, without a tee he is 
more accurate from short range and only slightly worse outside 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off: The first-year women's soccer team at Cal Lutheran will hold its 
first practice Friday, and the Regals will play host Sept. 14 to Claremont-Mudd 
College in their opener. The Regals' schedule includes 16 games and a 
tournament at Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
George Kuntz, the Cal Lutheran men's soccer coach, also will coach the women's 
team. Teri Rockhold will assist him. Kuntz said that he expects about 25 women 
to try out for the team -- about one-third of them freshman recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not done a lot of recruiting," Kuntz said. "We made a big push on 
campus, and there was a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Kuntz will put his new team through a crash course in soccer skills and 
conditioning. The Regals will work out three times a day and also do a morning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will compete as a National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
Division I independent, but Kuntz does not expect the Regals to be a playoff 
team in their first year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking at wins and losses the first season," Kuntz said. "The main 
thing is that they feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Fast Freddie: Moorpark College has one tailback returning and another 
transferring from another college, but the most impressive of all may be an 
incoming freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bittner, coach of the Raiders, says that Freddie Bradley, a 6-1, 205-pound 
running back from Hueneme High, has been a standout in early workouts. "Either 
he's very good, or we're very bad," Bittner said, "because we can't tackle the 
guy in practice. He's running right through us." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark already had Johnny Brown, who as a freshman rushed for 445 yards and 
four touchdowns during the regular season. Then, Marc Monestime, who set a 
Ventura County career rushing record while at Thousand Oaks High, transferred 
from Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the addition of Bradley, who rushed for 1,067 yards and scored 13 
touchdowns at Hueneme last season, Bittner has been able to move Tony Kerr from 
running back to the defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little short in that area," Bittner said of the secondary. "And 
that's a more natural position for Tony. That's where he'll play if he goes on 
to major college ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders also have been helped by the addition of 6-4, 270-pound Vince 
Plymire on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Plymire, who won the heavyweight division in the state junior college wresting 
championships last season, has exhausted his junior college eligibility in that 
sport but not in football. 
</P>
<P>
"He decided he wanted to play football this year and I'm delighted," Bittner 
said. "He hasn't played since high school because the two seasons overlap, but 
he's a great athlete who should definitely help us at that position. He's very 
quick for his size." 
</P>
<P>
Bird's eye: A quartet of Northridge football players worked out Tuesday under 
the watchful eye of a scout from the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Being considered as possible draft choices or free agents by the Falcons are 
offensive tackle Jim Matthews, guard Barry Voorhees, defensive tackle Mike 
Meehan and cornerback Willie James. 
</P>
<P>
Also getting a look, in an informal pre-practice workout, was former Matador 
punter Trent Morgan. 
</P>

Totally tubular: KADY, an independent television station in Oxnard, has agreed 
to televise two Cal Lutheran football games this fall. 
</P>
<P>
KADY will carry Kingsmen home games against Hayward (Oct. 14 at 2 p.m.) and 
Southern Utah (Oct. 28 at 1:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran football has a bit of history in playing before the cameras. The 
Kingsmen's 1971 NAIA championship victory over Westminster (Pa.) College is the 
only NAIA game ever to be nationally televised. It was shown on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
KADY carried two Cal Lutheran games last year and has been televising Kingsmen 
games for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Great Scott: Curtis Scott, who rushed for 1,943 yards and 18 touchdowns for 
Monroe High last season, will attend Ricks Junior College in Rexburg, Ida., 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce College Coach Bob Enger had hoped to land Scott at the Woodland Hills 
campus, but he is resigned to the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless an incredible snow storm hits Idaho real soon, I don't expect Curtis 
back," Enger quipped.

MAGAZINES: BEHIND THE SCENES OF 'OLD HOUSE' CLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For countless gentrifiers saddled with sagging roofs and warped floors, Bob 
Vila, host of the Public Broadcasting Service's series, "This Old House," is a 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
He was, as the August-September issue of Boston Business magazine puts it, "the 
Superman of do-it-yourself TV, swooping in on dilapidated old shacks in his 
blue Ford pickup truck and 26 weeks later speeding away with a smiling couple 
waving goodby from the doorway of their gleaming, fully restored home." 
</P>
<P>
So why, last April, did Boston public television station WGBH take away Vila's 
hammer and give him the ax? As writer Paul Keegan tells it, the story behind 
that pink slip is a tale of how greed and egotism gnawed away at a solid idea 
like so much dry rot. 
</P>
<P>
"This Old House" was 
</P>
<P>
created by Russell Morash, who also cooked up such well-loved how-to shows as 
"The Victory Garden," "The New Yankee Workshop" and the everlasting Julia Child 
as "The French Chef." 
</P>
<P>
Since its premiere 10 years ago, "This Old House" has become the most popular 
half-hour show on PBS. At its peak last year, it lured 22 million viewers away 
from the networks and cable channels. It won five Emmys. The show connected, 
Keegan writes, with Americans' "wildest dreams and deepest fears." 
</P>
<P>
Child was PBS' and Morash's first star, rising to celebrity in the '60s and 
'70s. This was the pure, noblesse oblige period of PBS, when a few cookbooks 
and videos discreetly peddled on the side were considered a fair part of the 
bargain with the low-paying station, according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
Vila's stardom came in a much different era. 
</P>
<P>
Both Morash and Vila knew there were big bucks to be made in public 
broadcasting, the article asserts, adding that "Under the pious rubric of 
educational television, they could both get what they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
A small-time developer who had left some less-than-satisfied customers and 
neighbors in his wake, Vila was quick to cash in on PBS fame. He raked in 
endorsements, earning as much as $500,000 on the side last year, Keegan writes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Reagan Administration's budget had forced PBS to do some 
entrepreneurial labors, too. By the end of the show's 10th year, Keegan writes, 
the folksy House gang, having moved on to increasingly upscale abodes, was not 
so much rebuilding as inserting: putting in prefab cabinets, trendy windows and 
$1,000 toilets, all with the label of the manufacturer who had donated them 
prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
The two enterprising men before and behind the "This Old House" cameras had 
their differences, but the final fallout between Morash and Vila occurred only 
when their enterprises clashed. 
</P>
<P>
When Vila signed on as spokesman for the competitor of the lumber company that 
spends $1.2 million to underwrite "This Old House," it was more than Morash -- 
or the lumber company -- could stand. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a remodeled Old House will appear this fall with only the ghost of 
Bob Vila haunting the rickety hallways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Class of Nannies 
</P>
<P>
Back off, goat ropers. "Nanny Times" ain't for you. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-month-old magazine with the unlikely name is aimed at the estimated 1 
million Americans who provide in-home or live-in child care, said Gillian 
Gordon, president and editor-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rapidly growing field . . . there's such a dreadful shortage," Gordon 
explained with a lilt vaguely reminiscent of Mary Poppins. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Ireland, Gillian came to America via England. She got the idea for 
the magazine while trying to find a nanny for her own child. What she found is 
that the nanny's job is much different here than in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"In England, the training is very rigid -- two to five years. Student nannies 
have to spend six months on pediatric ward, six months in a maternity ward. The 
training is intensive." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks her publication will help to raise standards here. "A lot of these 
people are not trained, and we are trying to change that," she said, speaking 
from her in-home office, as her 3-year-old made childish sounds in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
Articles in the 25,000-circulation publication are targeted at nannies but may 
capture parents' attention, too. The July issue, for instance, included an 
article on "Interviewing for the Nanny Position" and features on children's 
teeth and teaching reading. It also had a story asking "Two-year-olds, Terrible 
or Terrific?" 
</P>
<P>
Future articles will deal with everything from nanny agencies to Halloween 
costumes, Gordon said. And each issue features classified advertisements aimed 
at nannies and those in need of their services. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions are $9.95 for 13 issues, at Nanny Times, P.O. Box 31, Rutherford, 
N.J. 07070 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Alert 
</P>
<P>
From the moment the AIDS epidemic first infected the media, heterosexuals have 
ridden a roller coaster from anxiety to calm, panic to complacency. 
</P>
<P>
Even a roller coaster gets boring after five years. But readers for whom the 
subject of AIDS now elicits a yawn may find themselves awakened by a pair of 
articles in the September Mirabella. 
</P>
<P>
In the first work, Brooke Kroeger describes how a white, middle-class, 
heterosexual woman, in none of the known risk groups, became a statistical 
anomaly -- infected with the HIV virus through normal heterosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
In the next article, Randy Shilts, author of the acclaimed history of the AIDS 
epidemic, "And the Band Played On," confronts the theory currently in vogue: 
that the risk of AIDS for heterosexuals is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
For a number of reasons, he writes, the AIDS epidemic is unlikely to spread 
through the United States in the same pattern manifested in Africa and other 
parts of the Third World, where heterosexual transmission is the norm. But that 
does not mean AIDS will not have a devastating effect on heterosexuals, Shilts 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Shilts, a homosexual, defied the gay power structure by drawing attention to 
the way gay bathhouses amplified the spread of the disease. He also has argued 
that some gay community leaders and medical professionals encouraged the media 
to exaggerate the heterosexual AIDS risk in America because they knew the 
government would not fund a war against a disease that killed only homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
The people who cried wolf, he believes, now bear some responsibility for the 
negligence that the media and leaders show now that AIDS has, in fact, spread 
into certain heterosexual communities. 
</P>
<P>
In the inner city, Shilts points out, crack houses may be the heterosexual 
equivalent of the bathhouses that helped spread the disease so rapidly in the 
early '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Shilts concludes: "No reasonable person looking at the awe-inspiring levels of 
HIV infection in the inner city can possibly say there is not a heterosexual 
AIDS problem in America. What the heterosexual-myth proponents are really 
saying is that because AIDS is not a problem for middle-class Caucasians, it's 
not a problem. In other words, millions of poor African Americans and Hispanics 
don't matter. It's truly astonishing that such a transparently racist analysis 
can earn such intellectual currency in contemporary America."

ERMA BOMBECK: FOR MOMS, NOTHING'S OUT OF THE QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other night I climbed into bed and had just closed my eyes when my husband 
asked, "Is my light going to bother you?" 
</P>
<P>
Every night of our married life he has asked this question, and every night of 
our married life I have replied, "Not unless I plan on sleeping." It's not 
important that I sleep with No. 30 sunblock on my eyelids. What is important 
here is that somewhere between civility and habit, we know the answers to most 
questions before we ask them. 
</P>
<P>
My kids always like to remind me that when they were growing up, one of my 
favorite banalities was, "Are you going to go through life with a finger up 
your nose?" As my daughter points out, "Not only was it a stupid question, but 
you stood there insisting on an answer, like we had to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Why do we do it? Why do I stand in the emergency ward of a hospital and ask, 
"Would you take a personal check?" Get real! They'd take my car in trade if 
they thought I couldn't pay the bill any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Waiters who stand at your table and ask, "Could I tempt you with dessert this 
evening?" know the answer before they ask the question. But first, they have to 
wait until everyone at the table looks at everyone else with just the right 
amount of hesitation before someone whines, "Why don't you bring us a whole 
cake and four forks . . . just to taste." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really want to see our home movies, do you?" is another given. I 
don't know why people ask it. Nor can I figure out the speaker who asks, "Will 
you forgive me for digressing for a moment?" Especially if he is digressing at 
an hour when you should be undressing and going to bed! 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is guilty at one time or another of throwing out questions that beg to 
be ignored, but mothers seem to have a market on the supply. "Do you want a 
spanking or do you want to go to bed?" "Are you going to let a little dog like 
that scare you?" "Do you want Mommy to go away and never come back?" "Don't you 
want to save some of the pizza for your brother?" "Didn't anyone see the dog 
scratching on the door to get out?" "Wasn't there any change?" 
</P>
<P>
It's possible we live in hope that someone, someday, will give us the answer we 
want to hear. Then it's possible we just love to hear ourselves talk. You know 
what I'm saying?

ART BUCHWALD: HIGH FINANCE AND HIGHER EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
College tuitions are going through the roof. Latest reports indicate it now 
costs $21,000 to send your loved one for a year to any respectable institution 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the end of high tuition raises but rather the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Most educational experts predict that by 1995 the tariff for an average 
150-pound male student or a 110-pound female student will be $1 million a year, 
not counting admission to basketball games. Who will be the lucky students? 
Young people whose parents have made a killing in Time-Life-Warner Brothers 
stock or who own six or seven skyscrapers in a rezoned Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Meyer Daniloff, a Regis Professor of Matriculation at Ivy League 
Normal, why tuitions were rising so fast. He replied, "All the universities in 
America are looking for a better class of student, and the only way we can get 
it is to raise the price of admission.We're tired of the grungy, unkempt, badly 
mannered student of the past, and the only way to get rid of them is to raise 
the rates. As the midget who sat on J.P. Morgan's lap once said, 'If you have 
to ask what college costs, then you can't afford it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Won't schools become boring if only rich kids can attend them?" 
</P>
<P>
"They will at first, but pretty soon the students will get used to being with 
their own kind, and you will have a country club atmosphere that most schools 
at the moment seem to lack." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there any way that middle-class students can find the wherewithal to attend 
college?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course. You don't think our society would keep them out just because they 
can't afford to go?" 
</P>
<P>
"How can they do it?" 
</P>
<P>
"They can buy a state lottery ticket, and if they win the lucky jackpot they 
can go to any school of their choice. But they have to pick all eight numbers 
before the registrar will accept them." 
</P>
<P>
He continued, "The main advantage to the schools raising tuition is that they 
get a fat-cat student who will eventually give to the alumni fund. The downside 
is that if it gets too expensive to go to college, fathers and mothers will not 
know what to do with their offspring when they reach 18 years of age. Parents 
in the past could get rid of their children without looking cruel by sending 
them to college. Now the children will have every excuse to stay in the house 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Without intending to, the colleges are making life miserable for the 
parents of middle- and lower-class kids." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult problem, but there is nothing you can do about it. There was 
always the fear that America would eventually price itself out of higher 
education. This is as good a time as ever." 
</P>
<P>
"Will the students who pay the top-of-the-line fee get a better education?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why they should. We're not saying all parents have to come up with 
the tuition or else. All we're saying is that if a student chooses to become an 
airline pilot for a drug cartel just because he can't afford school we are not 
to blame." 
</P>
<P>
"Will you guarantee tuition is not going to rise more in just a few years?" 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to education, nobody can predict the future. But I'll bet Pete 
Rose anything that it isn't going to go down."

ALICE KAHN: BRING BACK THE '70S (IF YOU CAN FIND THEM) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you're sick of nostalgia, the nostalgia turnaround time starts 
speeding up. An aggressive ad campaign for the new Mazda Miata convertible 
panders to baby boomers with its instant nostalgia approach. "It was a time," 
the ad reminds us, "when T-shirts and jeans were in." Seems like only yesterday 
because . . . it was. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who are still recovering from the loss of our poodle-skirt and 
Flintstones-lunchbox investments wonder: What next? Nostalgia for the future? 
</P>
<P>
We were hardly prepared for the upsurge in tie-dye futures. Department stores 
across the country are opening '60s boutiques fueled by Woodstock publicity. 
You can now buy color-coordinated tie-dyed skirt-and-blouse sets, love beads, 
big flower icons, fringed leather jackets and other neat expensive stuff. (Hey, 
kids, here's a hot tip: If you have to buy it in a department store it isn't 
really the '60s.) 
</P>
<P>
One TV fashion report showed a Macy's manager talking about the booming sales 
among the junior-high set. "Of course it's a cleaned-up '60s look. We wouldn't 
want to bring back the dirty stuff," he said, bringing back the myth of the 
"dirty hippie." 
</P>
<P>
(Reality check: Some of my best friends in the '60s were anal-retentive 
hippies. Their yurts were spotless.) 
</P>
<P>
One problem with bringing back the '60s is that most of it happened in the 
'70s. What we call the '60s was actually a period from 1967 to 1974. And this 
is where the nostalgia sell is going to be in big trouble. Who actually 
remembers the '70s? 
</P>
<P>
The other day, my friend Steve walked out of the '70s and back into my life. 
Steve had moved to Maine 10 years ago to teach philosophy at a tiny college in 
a tiny town. He was back for a conference -- an '80s kind of trip, not a '60s 
kind of trip. 
</P>
<P>
He started talking about the good old days -- things we had done together, 
meals we had had together, places we'd gone. Only I couldn't remember any of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Was it substance abuse? No; Steve remembered me not as a substance abuser but 
as a health freak. He remembered the whole-grain bread I used to bake. I was 
the person who inspired him to start jogging. He often thinks of me as he jogs 
somewhere near the coast of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Is it senility? But I can remember virtually everything that happened up until 
1971. I can picture the hospital room where I woke up after my tonsillectomy in 
1949. I can recite my line from the "What Is America to Me?" assembly in 1957. 
("It's the peppermint ice cream on the Fourth of July. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
I can tell you where I was when I heard that Robert Kennedy was shot. I can 
recite chapter and verse from "The Teachings of Don Juan" by Carlos Castenada. 
</P>
<P>
Then fast-forward to 1982, also clear as a bell. I published my first newspaper 
story -- a 4,000-word piece on jogging in my neighborhood. I bought my first 
yuppie business-gal tweed jacket. I stopped wearing jeans. 
</P>
<P>
But all those swell times with Steve, that hole in my head called the '70s -- 
where did the time go? 
</P>
<P>
Could it have been -- oh no! -- just me-generation egomania? Was I so absorbed 
in my self-improvement and my self-care and my self-esteem that I forgot to 
notice the people and things going on around me? Once again, that unique, 
all-improved ME turned out to be just another trend slave in the demographic 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
So here's the upcoming challenge for the marketing "community." Can they find 
the lost '70s and resell the self we forgot we were?

MORE RAP ON THE FLAP OVER FLIPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "The Flipper Flap" (by Lynn Smith, Aug. 16), I am one who holds 
that swimming with captured dolphins is a pleasure won at much too high a cost. 
It is telling that the human beings so eager to experience the unique 
gentleness of these creatures are willing to do so at the expense of their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners, no matter how petted and loved -- no matter how docile -- still 
remain in jail. What crimes did these amazing and loving animals commit to be 
thus incarcerated? They are not our toys or playthings. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, we may yet come to learn this through the dolphins themselves, who 
within the confines of their servitude, tweak our consciences by their 
nobility, their captured spirits hovering over our vacation fun.

MORE RAP ON THE FLAP OVER FLIPPER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just returned from the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, where I participated in the 
Dolphin Quest program. Dolphin Quest is not run or supervised by the Hyatt but 
is a private facility housed there. The trainers and founders of the program, 
not the hotel, are responsible for the heavily supervised interactions with the 
dolphins housed there. Smith's article implied that Dolphin Quest was a 
hotel-operated program; perhaps the other hotels mentioned will, in fact, run 
their own programs, but a distinction needs to be made as far as Dolphin Quest 
is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
It would be tragic if federal regulation limits or ends the Dolphin Quest 
program. No amount of mail from the myriad conservations groups I support has 
ever had the same profound effect on me as Dolphin Quest did, nor provided the 
level of respect, understanding and compassion for these intelligent, gentle 
creatures.

PROBLEM OF ADDICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Siegel's theory on drugs ("Artificial Paradise," by Bob Sipchen, Aug. 
14) was interesting and correct when stating "Just say no" is woefully 
inadequate. I also agree that every society, from the most primitive to the 
most sophisticated has had a need to alter consciousness -- like the great 
American ritual of getting drunk on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
However, Siegel does not seem to take into account the fact that most people 
alter consciousness only occasionally -- like one takes an aspirin for a 
headache. But there are those in our society who become addicted to substances 
very quickly and they are no longer trying to alter their consciousness but 
need the drug of choice simply to function. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if research could be done on what makes the addict unable to pop a 
pill, smoke a joint, take a drink, without becoming the drug's slave, we would 
save hundreds of thousands from heartbreak and despair. It seems that research 
in that area would be more productive than looking for the impossible -- a 
"safe" drug that would not cause addiction.

MEDICAL INSURERS

<P>
The article centered on the dilemma of the insurance industry and the physician 
(and) creates the ludicrous illusion that the physician makes long and 
fruitless efforts to obtain the approval of the insurer or governmental agency 
for his proposed treatments. In every other setting than hospital or surgical, 
this is simply not the case. He proceeds with his intended tests and treatments 
and bills both the patient and the insurer. If the insurer or governmental 
agency disapproves the charge, the bill is then continued in full amount to the 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every patient is made aware by the physician's staff is that he is 
"always responsible" for the physician's charges. This intimidation usually 
works very well, especially with the elderly Social Security patient on a 
borderline poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
A fair portrayal of "utilization review" is that it is focused almost totally 
for the benefit of the insurance industry.

YOUR COINS: CONTENTS OF PAPERWEIGHT MAY CARRY HEAVY PRICE

Question: For years I have been using a paperweight on my desk -- a U.S. silver 
dollar, which in retrospect I imagine was one of the few I ever brought back 
from Las Vegas a number of years ago. However, on looking at it -- it does not 
shine like the Vegas silver -- with a magnifying glass, I was surprised to find 
it was dated 1799. Everything is clear to tread, and there is no mutilation. At 
the Hollywood Library, only one book listed it, and it gave only the degrees of 
grading or condition. Nowhere did it give a clue to any price value. Can you 
give me a ballpark figure of its possible value? -- W.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The earliest United States dollar was issued in 1794. Certainly 1799 is 
desirable, as are all of the early dollars. It's hard to believe that anyone 
would transform such a coin into a paperweight, even in Las Vegas. It's 
important to find out whether your coin is genuine. Many coin dealers can help 
you with this, or you can go to a certification service. If genuine, your 1799 
$1 is worth $300 and up, depending upon condition. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the market price for the 1986 proof silver Eagle and gold Eagle 
coins? How about the 1989 proof version for both? -- R.E.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Proof 1986 silver Eagles are now selling for about $30. Proof gold Eagles 
for the same year are about $429. This is a popular United States bullion coin 
that essentially will fluctuate in price along with the spot price of gold and 
silver. With the passage of time, however, you can also expect it to become a 
collector piece, which should add to its value. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 edition is being offered for $585 for the 1-ounce proof gold and $23 
for the proof silver. Since its inception in 1986, there has been a drop-off in 
Eagle orders. The Mint only produces as many as are ordered; in 1986, 446,290 
gold proofs were sold. The number dropped to 87,133 in 1988. If the pattern 
continues the Eagle could become a rather low-mintage piece. Only time will 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have two gold coins: a $10 1906 Liberty and a $5 1913 Indian; also a 1928 
Irish florin and several quarters, 1934 to 1944. I would like to know the 
estimated value of these coins. -- J.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your $10 gold piece is worth $225 and up; the $5 gold piece is $200 and up; 
the Irish coin is worth about $12, and your quarters are worth 75 cents each 
and up, depending on condition.

His Third Her Second by Paul Estaver (Soho: $17.95; 260 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"His Third Her Second" is ideal vacation reading for the '80s and beyond. 
Instead of thrusting you into a violent, bewildering and terrifying world, it 
transports you to the magic realm of Henry Calef and his wife Margo, who are 
attempting, against considerable odds, to create a happily united family from 
six disparate and occasionally hostile elements. The author of this charming 
story may find himself in the vanguard of a whole new movement. Now that daily 
life provides all the horror and confusion that anyone can endure, escapist 
reading must offer a respite. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a twice-divorced 50 year old man meeting a widow with three young 
children at a service station; not only falling in love on the spot and 
proposing marriage right after lunch, but declaring himself eager to share the 
responsibility of their blended families. Henry has a 7-year-old adopted 
daughter Libby, left in his custody when his last wife decamped after deciding 
she liked the idea of motherhood more than the actuality. He's gentle, witty 
and stable as Mt. Rushmore; optimistic despite his marital history; willing to 
adapt to Margo's necessarily rather haphazard life style. Completing the dream, 
Margo is cheerful, resourceful, and beautiful in a wholesome outdoorsy way. 
Henry is an upper-echelon Washington bureaucrat; Margo is 20 years younger, a 
free spirit who runs a riding school and supplements her uncertain income by 
tending bar. Instead of causing a conflict, these significant differences 
merely intensify the mutual attraction. We're close to a new definition of 
fantasy here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Arresting Metaphor 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties that form the plot are caused by the assorted children, none 
of whom have yet learned adaptive techniques, and who get along, in one of 
Henry's most arresting metaphors, "like 4 pairs of sneakers in a dryer." 
</P>
<P>
A fiercely willful child, Henry's daughter Libby is sweetly manageable when she 
gets her way and an absolute tyrant when she doesn't. Himself the victim of a 
rigid upbringing, Henry has learned to give in on the trivial issues and stand 
firm on the crucial ones. Though he's rewarded with Libby's unqualified 
adoration, he sometimes feels "like a marsupial." Until Margo, all the women 
he's met have either gushed over Libby or regarded her as a temporary 
disability, attitudes that have effectively prevented him from forming any 
lasting relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Margo's easy and natural approach strikes precisely the right note, instantly 
winning Libby's approval. Her three children are another case entirely. Her 
eldest son Marty treats Henry with the faintly contemptuous, exaggerated 
respect a conscript might show to a sergeant. Marty, in fact, has actually 
attempted to rob a bank sometime before the story even begins. After an 
unsuccessful attempt to intimidate Henry by cataloguing her family's worst 
traits, Sandra, the 13-year-old, finds increasingly subtle ways to keep him 
perpetually off-balance. Tommy, Margo's youngest son, quickly forms an unholy 
alliance with Henry's Libby, united in resistance to their well-meaning 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Years pass, marked by familiar familial crises refreshed by Henry's wry 
perspective on disaster and Margo's remarkable resilience. After suffering his 
second coronary attack, Henry inventories his life to a fascinated doctor. 
"I've married a woman with three teen-agers who have demolished two 
automobiles, a third of my record collection and the microwave . . . I have 
tripled my sexual activity and joined a quaint religious sect." "Which one?" 
the cardiologist asks, expecting a clue from the answer. "The Episcopalians," 
Henry says, his aplomb unaffected even by the specter of open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How and Why It Endures 
</P>
<P>
Though a cynic observing this marriage would have given it six months, the 
author shows exactly how and why it endures for decades. By the end of the 
novel, Henry and Margo are grandparents, aware that one child is almost 
certainly gay while another is about to move into the basement apartment with 
her three toddlers. The school drop-out has become the most successful of the 
lot, leaving her conventional siblings at the starting gate. Tommy's future is 
still undecided, and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Having 
weathered all this stress plus an extramarital affair, the hero and heroine are 
still blissfully happy and ready for new challenges. How's that for a 
20th-Century fantasy of modern life?

REFORM COMES TOO LATE FOR ANATOLY MARCHENKO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Live Like Everyone by Anatoly Marchenko, translated by Paul Goldberg (Henry 
Holt: $19.95, 220 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika came too late for Anatoly Marchenko. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 8, 1986, after nearly 30 years in and out of the Gulag, Marchenko died 
in Christopol Prison, where he was serving a 15-year term for the crime of 
writing a book. Now we can read the book that cost Marchenko his life -- "To 
Live Like Everyone" is the anguished cry of a man condemned by his own nature 
to tell the truth, and condemned by fate to spend his life in a place where the 
truth is a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life on the Run 
</P>
<P>
"To Live Like Everyone" is Marchenko's account of life on the run for a man 
whose restless conscience and dark vision make him an outcast and a wanderer. 
"To this day, I am convinced that suffering only begins after release from the 
camps," he writes. "Spending three days in the same place without an internal 
residency permit is a violation of passport rules. Three such violations, and 
it's back on trial and back to the camps. That's the vicious circle: the law 
says, get a residency permit, but the militia refuses to issue it, knowingly 
and deliberately making you a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1938, Marchenko was a true proletarian, a child of the working poor 
that still exist in the the worker's state. His father was one of the mazutniki 
("greasers") who worked on the railroads: "Black industrial fuel literally 
dripped off their clothing," Marchenko recalls. "They stewed in it." His 
childhood home was one room in a barracks somewhere along the Trans-Siberian 
railroad -- and Marchenko, it seems, stewed in it. 
</P>
<P>
Marchenko introduces us to the contemporary underclass of the Soviet Union, the 
dead souls who are released from prison only to find themselves a different 
kind of servitude on the outside. The scenes of the bleak Soviet provincial 
towns where Marchenko grew up, and where he sought to make a life, are faintly 
Dickensian, but wholly devoid of charm: a hellish brick factory where former 
camp inmates spend half their days hauling bricks and the rest of the time atop 
the brick ovens, which is their only home; a bread-baking plant where each man 
must hump sacks of flour from grain elevator to bakery, 10 tons per man during 
each shift. 
</P>
<P>
He depicts life in the remote villages and outposts of Siberia as an 
unrelenting horror story. A 3-year-old girl disappears in the forest, and the 
townsfolk blame her death on "the religious fanatics." A man falls down drunk 
in the snow and stays there until his arms are frostbitten; now he's a 
double-amputee who frightens children with is "black stumps." A plane crashes 
near a surveyor's outpost; the residents ignore the cries of an infant who 
survived the crash, and loot the corpses: "The infant soon froze to death," 
reports Marchenko. "The crying stopped." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kindred Spirits 
</P>
<P>
When, at last, Marchenko finds his way to Moscow, he discovers kindred spirits 
in the intelligentsia, a class that he had been taught to despise. "In all, we 
equated the people of intellectual professions with authority, the 'bosses.' 
And what's there to love the bosses for? They are the haves who want to pay the 
have-nots as little as they can and charge them as much as they can," he writes 
of his peasant upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the intelligentsia of Moscow that gives this angry man a weapon of 
enormous and enduring power -- the typewriter and carbon-paper publishing 
apparatus of samizdat, the underground self-publishing movement of the Soviet 
Union. Soon Marchenko is in trouble with the KGB again, but now he has 
comrades, a cause, and -- crucially -- a byline that reaches out of the Gulag 
and all the way to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Marchenko does not come across as an especially heroic or likable man; he 
possesses the kind of insistent and unforgiving conscience that gets on the 
nerves of the complacent and the comfortable, whether in enslaved countries or 
free ones. But we begin to see that a man like Marchenko is especially 
maddening to those who remember, with a sigh of regret, the days when the great 
and small feared the knock on the door at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Live like everyone!" a KGB agent rails at Marchenko. "Stop throwing mud at the 
good name of the Motherland! . . . All of you scream, 'This is no better than 
Stalin!' Let me ask you this. What do you think would be left of you if we were 
no better than Stalin?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Years After Death 
</P>
<P>
There's an irony, of course, to the fact that Marchenko died before the advent 
of Gorbachev and glasnost. Today, barely three years after Marchenko's death in 
prison, a fellow dissident sits in the Soviet parliament and is free to write 
the preface to the American edition of "To Live Like Everyone." Marchenko, 
observes Andrei Sahkarov, is one of those "people of immaculate honesty who are 
prepared to make any sacrifice in the name of moral principles." 
</P>
<P>
Yet I suspect that Marchenko would be wary of the remarkable changes in the 
practices of Soviet power. Mindful of what he darkly refers to as "the 
peculiarities of the path of our historical development and our 'national 
traditions,' " Marchenko warns: "Lawful actions of today could be the criminal 
offenses of tomorrow. . . . In this country no one -- and nothing -- is 
forgotten."

STAGE WATCH : LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE AMONG THEATERS UPSET BY STATE ARTS COUNCIL 
RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of Southern California's largest and most important theaters are reeling 
from the poor ranking they received last week from the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse, South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa and the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center are incensed at large cuts each sustained in CAC grant awards, 
cuts that are the result of a modified evaluation procedure that the theaters 
say they don't completely understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged by the CAC's lack of comprehension (of artistic excellence)," 
said the Theatre Center's Bill Bushnell. "No one is going to convince me that 
La Jolla, LATC and South Coast are not among the best theaters in the state." 
</P>
<P>
In slicing La Jolla's grant from $47,363 to $22,949, the CAC cited (among other 
things) a deficit that "seems out of control" and an outreach program whose 
artistic quality "could be developed" and currently shows a lack of "ethnic 
diversity on board, staff and audiences." 
</P>
<P>
"The deficit ($703,000) is obviously a concern of the CAC," said La Jolla 
managing director Allan Levey. "It's a much larger concern of ours. It's not 
easy to find money for deficit reductions," he added, reiterating that a 
three-year $250,000 National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant awarded La 
Jolla in February will be used to bring the deficit down. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the shortest playing season and smallest number of seats" of any 
regional theater, he said, explaining that because of the playhouse's tie-in 
with UC San Diego, on whose campus it resides, seasons -- and therefore earning 
power -- have been limited by the university's needs. 
</P>
<P>
The first of two new on-campus theaters is expected to be ready by March, 1991. 
"That will allow us to expand to a nine-month season and generate more funds," 
Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
CAC funding for the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which has had a stormy 
financial history, took a modest tumble from $37,982 last year to $33,671 this 
year, because of "ongoing managerial problems," the CAC report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The drop is the least of my concerns," Bushnell said. "What's abundantly clear 
is that if you don't play by established rules you don't score." 
</P>
<P>
South Coast, an award-winning theater with what California Arts Council 
theater-grants administrator Ray Tatar described as "a model administration," 
saw its 1989 award drop to $81,950 from $106,400 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 23% cut in funding over last year leaves the theater hard put to understand 
why. "In the past, we had been told our outreach was exemplary," said producing 
artistic director David Emmes. "This year we were slammed. If they want us to 
do an outreach program -- which we want to do -- they are paradoxically cutting 
the funds that make it possible. It's a curious sort of message. 
</P>
<P>
"We were also told that representation of minorities on our board and staff 
were low. What doesn't compute mathematically is why other theaters with 
similar characteristics received funding either equal to last year or more. 
</P>
<P>
"What concerns me most is that the apparent emphasis on the different criteria 
seems to change every year. The nice thing about the NEA (National Endowment 
for the Arts) is the sense of consistency about 
</P>
<P>
how you're being evaluated. My only hope for the future is that, once these 
things are set, the criteria will be better understood and will be applied with 
some consistency from year to year." 
</P>
<P>
The source of these inconsistencies apparently lies in the change in the CAC's 
evaluation system. Two seven-member peer panels -- a discipline panel and a 
newly created LBO (Large Budget Organization) panel -- rank theaters on two 
bases: managerial soundness and artistic achievement (the discipline panel) and 
the quality and multi-ethnicity of outreach programs (the LBO panel). Because, 
as Tatar explained it, the new LBO panel this year ranked all theaters near the 
low end of a 1-4 scale, the level of some of the awards fell accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Emmes nor Levey is content to let things lie there. 
</P>
<P>
"The information we've received," Emmes said, "has not satisfied us so far. 
We're attempting to get more data and understand how we received the money we 
received, to see if we have grounds for an appeal." 
</P>
<P>
"What's tricky is the change in procedure," Levey said. "We don't agree with 
the panel's comments. We're contemplating an appeal. Des (McAnuff, La Jolla's 
artistic director) is out of town. I want to talk to him. I want to talk to 
them (council members). And then we'll see. They smacked our hand, for sure. It 
hurts, but when push comes to shove, we're still providing the goods. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC MAESTRO: Three revivals and one new musical make up the California Music 
Theatre's 1990 season at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. It kicks off with "On 
the Town" (Feb. 14-March 4), featuring Lorna Patterson, the music of Leonard 
Bernstein and book and lyrics of Betty Comden and Adolph Green. 
</P>
<P>
Next up will be the Mitch Leigh-Joe Darion-Dale Wasserman "Man of La Mancha" 
(June 6-24) starring Robert Guillaume, followed by "Clothespins and Dreams" 
(Aug. 8-26), a new piece set in a family-owned laundry yard in Harlem, 1911, 
before the advent of the electric washing machine began to wreak havoc. The 
show, with music by Ken Hirsch and book and lyrics by Ron Miller, will feature 
Barney Martin and Eloise Laws. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, that perennial favorite orphan, "Annie," with John Schuck, Tom Hatten, 
Marcia Lewis and Lisa Robinson, will close the season (Nov. 28-Dec. 16, 1990). 
There are tentative plans for "Annie" to play the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center for a week after its Pasadena engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Music Theatre is poised to open its next show of the current 
season: "The Pajama Game," starring Pat Harrington and Mary Jo Catlett, Oct. 
4-22. That will be followed by the final show of 1989, Gilbert and Sullivan's 
"Iolanthe," Dec. 2-17.

A Las Vegas hotel executive has accused the musicians' union of lying in its 
current battle with management over the issue of taped music and guaranteed 
work. Musicians Local 369 is striking five Las Vegas resorts, charging that the 
hotels want to eliminate live music in the city by switching to taped music. 
John Giovenco, president of Hilton Nevada Corp., said Wednesday, "We don't have 
any intention of eliminating live entertainment in Las Vegas. The musicians' 
statements to that effect are just lies." Giovenco charged that "the union 
wants us to pay 14 to 25 musicians full salary to stand by and do nothing." He 
pointed out that most entertainers now appearing at the Las Vegas Hilton travel 
with their own orchestras and complex musical systems. "We end up paying the 
acts and their musicians," Giovenco said. "They don't require a house orchestra 
and they don't need backups." He said the Hilton was losing about $3 million a 
year in its showrooms to bring live entertainment to Las Vegas. Representatives 
of the five struck hotels are scheduled to meet this morning with officials of 
the musicians' union, and another meeting is to take place today between 
Southern Nevada labor leaders and Gov. Bob Miller's chief of staff, Scott 
Craigie, in an effort to find a solution to the strike. ALEENE MacMINN

"Mississippi Burning," the suspense drama about early '60s racial violence, 
steamed into the top spot of the Billboard magazine rental chart, up from No. 
3. "Tequila Sunrise," a love story with thriller undertones, took over the No. 
2 spot. It's rare for two dramas to be the top rentals, but these aren't 
ordinary dramas. "Burning" offers Gene Hackman, good reviews, controversy and a 
bunch of Oscar nominations while "Sunrise" offers Mel Gibson and Michelle 
Pfeiffer. Besides, the two comedies that reigned all summer, "Twins" and "Dirty 
Rotten Scoundrels," have finally started to run out of steam. The John Candy 
comedy, "Who's Harry Crumb?" -- mired at No. 13 -- hasn't been as popular as 
expected. It may not even make the Top 10. After two chart weeks, the Tom Hanks 
comedy, "The 'Burbs," is up to No. 15 -- OK but not great for a Hanks movie. 
"The Fly II" (No. 8) is the horror movie right now. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Naked Gun," featuring Leslie Nielsen as a bumbling cop, has No. 1 
written all over it. This madcap comedy, which grossed $78 million, debuted at 
No. 10. Look for it to be the hottest rental of the Labor Day weekend.

Over in Stockholm, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman is suing a tabloid for 
symbolic damages of one crown (15 cents), saying it broke the copyright to his 
memoirs. The film director and his publishers took the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet to court this week, charging that it published an article based on 
unedited material from his biography, "Laterna Magica," before it was published 
in 1987. Aftonbladet's editor, Thorbjorn Larsson, denied the charge, saying the 
article was based on interviews, books and television programs.ALEENE MacMINN

The figures are slow coming in, but it appears that the pay-per-view telecast 
of the Who's special "Tommy" performance at the Universal Amphitheatre last 
Thursday was not the record-breaker some had hoped for. Early reports from 
cable operators who carried the event indicate that between 1% and 1.5% of the 
12.5 million households with access to the show paid the $19.95 fee to see it, 
for a take of between $2.5 million and $3.7 million. A pay telecast of the 
Moscow Music Peace Festival earlier this month had a buy rate of 1.5%-2%. (In 
comparison, a 7% buy rate was anticipated for last Monday's "SuperSlam" 
wrestling event.) "It still is very successful for music on pay-per-view," 
Bruce Karpas, president of "Tommy" distributor Reiss Media Productions, said 
Wednesday from New York. "It just didn't do as spectacularly as we hoped. But 
between this and Moscow, August was a very productive month for music on 
pay-per-view." The pay-per-view concert watch now moves to a 
still-in-negotiation Rolling Stones concert, probably in November, which is 
expected to break all concert records. Meanwhile, the "Tommy" telecast comes to 
commercial TV on Sept. 13, airing on Fox stations (including Channels 11 and 6) 
from 8-10 p.m. ALEENE MacMINN

TASTES OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS SERVED ON SKEWERS IN ISTANBUL

"Do I have a place for you," my husband said when I arrived in Istanbul. He had 
been to this Turkish seaport on business and had already staked out places to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
We drove up the steep cobblestone streets in Etiler, a residential area, to 
Hacidan (pronounced haj-i-dan), a new restaurant serving only kebabs. Nothing 
but kebabs. 
</P>
<P>
We sat at the 20-foot counter attached to a 20-foot grill and watched the kebab 
chef, whose authority is as sacrosanct as a master sushi chef's in Japan, wield 
skewers as if they were a Mongolian warrior's swords. 
</P>
<P>
His orchestration, like the sushi chef, is a dance of hands, hopping from one 
kebab to another, turning, basting, unthreading skewers with the help of flat 
pita bread used as a mitt. 
</P>
<P>
The grill winds across the floor like a snake, with a cap over it made of 
hammered copper. Kebabs line the grill in neat rows -- vegetables, chiles, 
meats and poultry. The fires spark up, causing flecks of carbon to float over 
the grill like a shower of confetti. 
</P>
<P>
It was interesting to me that vegetables were cooked separate from meats and 
not together as we often see them in the United States. Masses of long green 
chiles threaded crosswise on skewers, look like giant green spiders charring on 
the grill. 
</P>
<P>
We ordered according to appetite, but if one left the menu to the chef, he'd 
seek to satisfy your wildest whim, lifting eyebrows with delight at the 
slightest indication of pleasure from the diner. A smile of satisfaction is his 
signal to continue to create, create, create, until you can eat no more. Then 
you signal or say, "NO MORE." 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of kebabs to choose from but among the most popular are, of 
course, shish kebab, meaning skewered meat, which was probably brought into the 
region by meat-eating civilizations from the northeast thousands of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shish kebab is simply a skewer of cubes of meat (usually lamb) marinated in 
lemon marinade. Bejti kebab, another popular kebab named after a famous kebab 
restaurant in Istanbul by the same name, is ground lamb shaped like a sausage 
and threaded on skewers lengthwise. It is served with or without pita bread. 
Beyti kebabs are similar to Greek souvlaki or soutzoukakia and Moroccan kefta 
kabab, as well as Arabic kofte. 
</P>
<P>
The kebab chef also prepared organ meat kebabs, which are actually a street 
food specialty found throughout Turkey and the Balkans. Kukurec or the Greek 
kokoretsi is a kebab made of bits and pieces of heart, kidney, sweetbreads and 
liver entwined with intestine of young lamb. The kebabs are served nestled in a 
French-type loaf with an onion-laden salad. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are chicken kebabs, which are seasoned with an Arabic spice mix 
known as baharat, apparently introduced to the region by Arab cooks over the 
centuries of trade with countries around the Mediterranean. Baharat is an 
intriguing mixture of spices, including coriander, cloves, cumin, cardamom, 
nutmeg and cinnamon, which seem to blend remarkably well. Baharat is especially 
good with fish and poultry but cooks also use the spice mix with meats. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny lamb chops, or medallions, cut out and encased in grape leaves were a 
treat, served over a flat saucer of lavash, a form of pliable giant-size crepe 
often used as an edible plate for foods throughout the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables also do well as kebabs, and any group of quick-cooking vegetables 
such as squash, tomatoes, onions, sweet peppers (including chiles), mushrooms 
and eggplant may be used with great success. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of the recipes inspired by our visit to Hacidan, plus another 
that seemed appropriate to add for shrimp lovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

THE VEGETARIAN: HOW TO PRESERVE SUMMER BOUNTY OF TOMATOES, BASIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fresh tomatoes and fresh basil are another of summer's fleeting treats. But 
Paula Wolfert, a cookbook author specializing in Mediterranean cuisine, 
recommends an effective way to preserve the bounty. 
</P>
<P>
For basil, rinse 3 cups of leaves well and place into a food processor or 
blender with 2 cups of cold water. Process until finely chopped. Transfer to 
ice cube trays and freeze. When frozen solid, transfer cubes to plastic storage 
bags and keep frozen until ready to use. One cube is equal to 2 tablespoons 
fresh basil. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH TOMATO SOUP WITH BASIL 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds tomatoes, peeled and chopped 
</P>
<P>
4 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
3 cups vegetable stock 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
4 slices whole-grain bread, lightly toasted 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Combine tomatoes, garlic, parsley and basil in saucepan. Cook until garlic is 
tender, then remove and discard all but 1 clove garlic. Puree tomato mixture in 
blender or food processor. 
</P>
<P>
Return puree to saucepan. Add stock, olive oil and bread. Simmer slowly until 
soup has thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot or chilled. 
Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
FETTUCCINE WITH BASIL 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup minced fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
20 walnuts halves 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces fettuccine 
</P>
<P>
Make paste of cheese, basil and walnuts in blender or food processor. With 
motor running, slowly add olive oil in steady stream. 
</P>
<P>
Cook fettuccine according to package directions. Drain and toss with basil 
sauce. Makes 4 servings.

 ABOUT WINE: COUPLE OF CULT WINERIES GROW WITH DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the 20th anniversary of Woodstock, people asked, "Where were you?" 
</P>
<P>
Some people ignored Woodstock to scour the countryside looking for cult wines 
-- pleading and cajoling to get their hands on wines like Schramsberg Champagne 
and David Bruce Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Cult wine once was a big deal with wine lovers. Two decades ago, a handful of 
wineries made tiny quantities of great wines that got word-of-mouth plaudits 
and generated intense competition to get a bottle or a case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Today We Gloat 
</P>
<P>
Today it's different. We gloat over getting a bottle of Dunn Howell Mountain 
Cabernet or Ferrari-Carano Reserve Chardonnay. Diamond Creek recently sold out 
its limited-production Cabernet designated Lake, a wine that carries a $100 
price tag. These are modern-day cult wines. 
</P>
<P>
But today there are at least lots of cult Chardonnays (Grgich, Chalone, 
Sonoma-Cutrer, Au Bon Climat among them) and dozens of cult Cabernets (Dunn, 
Spotteswood, La Jota, Jordan) and Pinot Noirs (Calera, Chalone, Etude). So it's 
possible to own a cult wine without much difficulty. (Jordan sold almost 80,000 
cases of wine last year.) 
</P>
<P>
But in the early 1970s, as California wine became an intriguing and exciting 
collectible as well as a grand taste experience, very few wines took on cult 
status, and they were truly limited in production. Stony Hill and Hanzell 
Chardonnays and Joseph Swan Pinot Noirs and Zinfandels were hard to obtain and 
achieved that status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Thousand Cases 
</P>
<P>
Among the highest-image wines were those from Schramsberg and David Bruce. 
Finding a bottle on a retail shelf was a serendipitous moment inducing 
euphoria. Neither made more than a few thousand cases. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bit surprising, then, when I discovered that both Schramsberg and 
David Bruce were celebrating their silver anniversaries; both have been in 
business for a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
And although Swan, Hanzell and Stony Hill wines remain limited in production, 
Bruce and Schramsberg have grown with the demand. One might assume from this 
that quality has been compromised, but I recently went through the two 
wineries' offerings and discovered that both have kept abreast of the latest 
technical changes in the industry, and that both are making wines that if 
anything are better than what they did in the past. Ironically, one helped the 
other improve. 
</P>
<P>
One fact is true for both wineries. For some years in the 1970s, neither 
improved. As they grew, quality grew erratic. But in the last three years, both 
wineries have stabilized, eliminating wines that were simply off the mark. 
Bruce and Schramsberg have grown more consistent, less erratic than they were a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Napa Valley-based Schramsberg, which makes only sparkling wine, has had to 
adapt to a shrinking supply of top-quality Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes; 
both varieties are in demand. To cope with this, Jack Davies has developed a 
unique method of payment to growers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price of the Wine 
</P>
<P>
Using an "evergreen" contract arrangement, Schramsberg pays growers based on a 
formula pegged directly to the price of the wine into which the grower's grapes 
go. Prices are "always higher than the Napa Valley average," said Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Schramsberg continues to experiment, first under wine maker Greg 
Fowler (who came on board in 1980) and now under Alan Tenscher, Fowler's 
successor in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Experimentation led to use of malolactic fermentation for small lots of wine 
(converting stronger acid into weak acid, which softens the wine), the dropping 
of sulfur dioxide use during production, and trying small quantities of grapes 
from other regions (such as the central coast and Mendocino) for complexity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handling the Grapes 
</P>
<P>
The greatest change is in the handling of the grapes. In 1982, Fowler 
discovered that the standard method of dumping grapes into the press wasn't 
gentle enough, and that if he used a suction device -- like a huge vacuum 
cleaner -- he could dump the fruit into the press with less damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the idea from David Bruce," said Fowler, who is now head wine maker for 
Domaine Mumm, across the Napa Valley. "The original idea came from Germany, 
where they use it to unload botrytised grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"The big drawback is that it's slow, but it gets the fruit into the press with 
a minimum amount of damage to the fruit, without tearing the skins and beating 
up the stems." 
</P>
<P>
The first wines to see this gentler method were from 1982, and Davies now has 
ready for release a small amount of a great wine from that harvest, and it's a 
wine new to the Schramsberg line. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Blanc de Noirs Late Disgorged ($25) is a marvelously complex, rich 
wine with deep Pinot Noir character and as much Frenchlike elements as I have 
seen in a California wine. The extended time on the yeast, en tirage as the 
French say, is the key to this superb wine. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Schramsberg's 1984 Blanc de Blancs Late Disgorged ($23) is an 
exceptional, deeply complex wine, one of the best I have tasted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Champagne Memories 
</P>
<P>
The latest regular release of Schramsberg Champagne is the 1983 Blanc de Noirs 
($20), which offers a marvelously complex aroma and creaminess in the finish 
that, again, is reminiscent of French Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1983 was Jack's first attempt to go to a lighter style, to get the alcohol 
down and to make a more delicate wine," said Fowler. "But we still retained 
strong Pinot character." 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Jamie Davies are true pioneers of the second wave of Napa Valley wine 
interest. An electronics executive with Ducommun Inc., Jack acquired the old 
facility once owned by Jacob Schram and slowly expanded it into a large, modern 
winery that sits above the caves dug by immigrant laborers in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
Schramsberg's caves, since enlarged extensively, now hold 2 million bottles of 
wine sitting en tirage. Davies intends to make this aging on the yeast a longer 
process, to give more complexity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart of the Collection 
</P>
<P>
More complexity is at the heart of the new collection of David Bruce wines too, 
but for those who recall the days when Bruce wines were termed "monsters," 
these latest wines are actually less dense and more compact. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, whose Santa Cruz Mountains winery was founded in 1964, was among the 
first wave of wineries to see the potential to make deeply concentrated wines 
from grapes that ripened to any degree desired. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the early Bruce Chardonnays closed in on (and topped) 15% alcohol. The 
1971 Bruce Chardonnay, with 15.5% alcohol, was reckoned by some critics to be 
an utter classic. His 1970 Zinfandel, with 17.5% alcohol, was a stunner; a 
Grenache was so dark and opaque that it was considered bizarre and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement generated by these massive brutes might have prompted Bruce, a 
dermatologist, to raise his prices excessively. He demurred, though he recalled 
that he did put out his 1969 Chardonnay, a tiny-production wine, at $22. "It 
was a monster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The monsters have recently been tamed. With Keith Hohlfeldt as wine maker 
(since 1982), Bruce wines are more mainstream, but they still retain the house 
style that made the man and his liquid famous. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnays are the more exotic wines of the line. Using 100% malolactic 
fermentation to generate big, rich, buttery elements, Hohlfeldt crafts wines of 
breadth and bigness. But they are in much better balance than the wines of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Tasting the 1987 Chardonnay with a California designation ($11) one sees that 
richness in a tighter, leaner package than ever. "We didn't know much about 
acid back then," said Bruce. "So we made wines that were big, with a slightly 
tannic finish, and people didn't seem to mind them." 
</P>
<P>
The prototype Bruce Chardonnay is the 1986 Estate Bottled Santa Cruz Mountains 
($18), a wine that hearkens back to the old days when butterscotch flavors 
played tag with the fruit elements. (Butterscotch usually won.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oddball Experiments 
</P>
<P>
Bruce always liked to play around with oddball things, like Grenache, and his 
latest experiment has yielded three wines that retail for $6.50. All are good 
examples of table wine that lean in the direction of the Rhone Valley. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed the 1987 Coteau de Shandon, a white wine that is made up mostly of 
Chenin Blanc, but with some oak-aged Chardonnay for depth. It reminded me of a 
white Hermitage at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Also enjoyable was a 1987 Vin Rouge that is a blend of Carignane, Petite Sirah 
and Cabernet Pfeffer, the latter adding an intriguingly spicy, peppery note to 
the otherwise tart, deeply flavored wine that has high acid and low tannins. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the three wines, however, was a pink wine called Vin Gris (federal 
officials rejected a humorous name, Gran Vis). It is a bone-dry rose made 
entirely from Petite Sirah. It is a striking example of Rhone richness in a 
pink wine, reminiscent of the Bandol Rose made famous by importer Kermit Lynch 
(which is more expensive). 
</P>
<P>
Bruce's fine 1985 Pinot Noir ($18) with spice and depth will be succeeded by an 
exceptional 1986 and a superior 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, Bruce says, "I was never aware I was making 'cult' wines. I 
was too busy being a doctor to pay attention to that." 
</P>
<P>
Schramsberg's first wine, released in 1967, was a nonvintage effort made in 
1965. Soon after the first vintage-dated wine, from 1966, hit store shelves 
about Woodstock time in 1969, retailers began clamoring for more and more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Price 
</P>
<P>
"And they wanted me to raise the price, to slow it down," said Davies. "Well, 
opportunism is one thing, but I hoped to be around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Both have survived the two decades since in health better, perhaps, than some 
"Woodstockies." 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Bandiera Chardonnay Carneros" ($6.50) -- For those who 
like the leaner, more Chablis-like styles of Chardonnay, this is a spectacular 
effort. Delicate lemon-scented aroma with a faint touch of slate and an 
attractive floral note. The taste is crisp and fruity, no residual sugar, and 
ends with snap. An exciting wine, better by far than the winery's 1987 version. 
Bandiera also has a companion red wine, 1986 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 
($6.50) that is another excellent value. Wonderfully herbal fruit, delicate oak 
and a nicely rounded finish for near-term drinking.

 MICROWAVE . . .: THIRST-AID FROM ICE TEA, LEMONADE, LIMEADE AND ORANGEADE 
MIXES 
</P>

authors specializing in microwave cookery.

<TEXT>
<P>
Is anything more welcome on a summer day than a frosty glass of ice tea or 
lemonade? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that you can brew the tea in an instant by microwave and even 
make big batches of lemonade, limeade and orangeade mixes without overheating 
either the kitchen or the cook or making a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps fruit ades aren't something you usually heat. Maybe you just stir the 
water, fruit juice and sugar together cold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Boost From Heat 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong with that except that the sugar never really dissolves as 
completely as it should, the flavors never mellow properly and the drinks 
always seem a tad cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
Our spicy microwave tea, sweetened with honey, and our trio of fruit ades 
positively sparkle in the glass and taste intensely spicy or fruity. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, our three fruit ades are prepared from handy mixes that can be 
stirred together in minutes, days ahead of time, then stored in the 
refrigerator. If tightly capped, they will keep two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When you're in need of refreshment, all you need do is add ice and water or 
club soda and stir. 
</P>

 FOOD BRIEFS: ABALONE AQUACULTURE COMES OUT OF ITS SHELL ON CENTRAL COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aquaculture's strides toward becoming a reliable source of scarce seafood 
species are evident from a Central California shellfish operation's recent 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Abalone Farm Inc., of Point Estero, harvested its one-millionth 
commercial-sized abalone. The milestone is significant because the mollusks 
have proved difficult to cultivate, and, as a result, there are less than 
half-a-dozen such operations currently in existence. 
</P>
<P>
The firm began growing the prized shellfish in cement tanks on a bluff 
overlooking Morro Bay in 1981. Initially, the Abalone Farm counted only one 
restaurant as a customer. 
</P>
<P>
But in subsequent years, the facility expanded and now distributes into five 
states and exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The abalone, which sell for $2.50 each or about $30 a pound, are harvested when 
they reach only several inches in size. 
</P>
<P>
One of the company's first marketing obstacles was to persuade chefs to accept 
the farm-raised variety, which is noticeably smaller than the plate-size, wild 
abalone that are caught by scuba divers in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Abalone Farm expects to market 50 metric tons of the shellfish or 
about 600,000 of the mollusks. The production is expected to double annually 
through 1993. The firm also sells abalone seeds to other aquaculture ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Developing the facility and related activities have proved difficult, according 
to a company representative. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of getting to the (one-millionth) abalone has been as slow as an 
abalone's pace," the firm stated. 
</P>
<P>
Change of Rank -- The seafood industry's recently launched advertising campaign 
had to make a last-minute switch in the name of its cartoon mascot at the 
request of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion, whose theme is "Eat Fish and Shellfish Twice a Week," originally 
set out to call its officious, mustachioed "spokesfish" the "Sturgeon General." 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked that the name 
be shelved because it was disrespectful of the agency's real-life surgeon 
general. There was also the possibility that the public might confuse the 
commercial's recommendation about seafood consumption with health and dietary 
guidelines issued by the most recent occupant of the surgeon general's office, 
C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought it was denigrating to the surgeon general's office," said Paul 
Ahrens, assistant account executive for W.B. Doner &amp; Co., the 
Baltimore-based agency that developed the campaign. "They also said that it 
took away from the seriousness of the office and that making fun of the surgeon 
general was not in good taste." 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which designed the $6.5 million campaign for the National Fish and 
Seafood Promotional Council, solved the problem by simply renaming its cartoon 
character "America's Official Spokesfish." 
</P>
<P>
Although the campaign's main thrust will come in October, National Seafood 
Month, the television commercials for seafood have already been airing. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going well, so far was we can tell," said Ahrens. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is also conducting research to measure attitudes about seafood both 
before and after the promotion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulating Bones -- A federal proposal would increase the number of bones 
present in fish fillets, according to a Washington-based newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
The National Marine Fisheries Service is in the final stages of adopting a 
regulation that would allow seafood processors to sell fish with bones still 
remaining in the flesh as long as the product was labeled as such, Nutrition 
Week reports. The measure is considered a labor-saving device and one that may 
lower the price of certain seafood varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would encompass all species and the presence of cartilage would no 
longer be considered a "workmanship defect," according to the federal 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation was originally requested by food retailers and the seafood 
industry. The proposal was then formulated by the fisheries service in 1985 
when the agency asked for public comment on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the comments received were positive, although the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration said that most consumers believe that the term fillet indicates 
boneless fish, the newsletter stated. FDA officials urged that labeling clearly 
indicate the presence of bones. 
</P>
<P>
Comments are being accepted on a final version of the regulation until Sept. 6. 
Once the regulation is approved, the products will be sold as "semi-boneless 
fillet-style" or as "bone-in fillets." 
</P>
<P>
The size of the bones allowed by the agency will depend upon the species 
involved, said Thomas J. Moreau, technical services unit director, with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service in Gloucester, MA. 
</P>
<P>
The fisheries service conducts a voluntary seafood inspection program for the 
U.S. Commerce Department. Prior to the current regulation, any fillets 
containing bones would not qualify for the U.S. Grade A designation. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulation will allow (bone-in) product to be processed under federal 
inspection and be eligibile to be graded," said Moreau. "If it does, in fact, 
contain bones then it will have to be labeled properly, but it can also then 
carry the U.S. Grade A stamp and the U.S. Department of Commerce Inspection 
mark." 
</P>
<P>
Moreau said that the size of the fish bones will vary but that the cartilage 
can be easily removed by consumers.

 LET'S EAT OUT: ADRIANO: EVEN THE DAILY SPECIALS CAN BE SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BUSH SMITH, Smith is a free-lance restaurant reviewer in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adriano Ristorante in Santa Ana gives a feeling of warmth and sureness the 
moment you enter. And the waitress was not too far off when she claimed, 
"Everything we serve is wonderful," and, she could add, a good value. 
</P>
<P>
Janina Musci, owner and hostess, sets the tone with her friendly greeting, her 
inquiry: "Is this your first time here? How did you hear about us?" And on my 
second visit, she said, "Nice to see you again." You can sense the teamwork in 
this restaurant, where service is friendly and attentive. (Yes, they could and 
did time dinner so we'd get to the not-too-distant Performing Arts Center on 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Adriano, hidden away in the Target shopping center, looks pretty, 
with its pink lace curtains, burgundy carpet, chairs and canopies over the 
espresso bar and kitchen opening. Pastel murals of the Italian countryside 
soften the walls, and fresh flowers brighten cloth-covered tables. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something Special 
</P>
<P>
Almost everything we tried from the regular menu was good, though I'd mark down 
the calzone, which was slightly burned. But the samplings from the day's 
specials were special. (Chef Tony Musci, Janina's husband, was born in Bari on 
the Adriatic coast of Italy, but he creates both northern and southern 
cuisine.) Clams with linguine starred fresh steamers, tender and sweet; the 
sauce was flavorful with broth, plus a pleasant hotness and a hint of Pernod. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh salmon, sauteed and served with fresh tomatoes, capers, green onions and 
a touch of rosemary, made such a hit with our resident 10-year-old gourmet that 
he was reluctant to give the rest of us a sample. A fork easily cut the veal 
medallions, delectably crowned with baby asparagus, pimiento and mushrooms. 
Rigatoni with a delicate cream sauce enhanced both dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Other popular specials include a Milanese-style osso buco, fettuccine with 
scampi in a creamy sauce and a lightly breaded boneless chicken breast topped 
with fresh spinach, provolone cheese and a light mushroom-wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The house salad is crisp and fresh, if not remarkable, but the insalata 
Adriano, brimming with romaine, artichokes, mozzarella, mushrooms and black 
olives, is almost a meal. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot more to consider on Adriano's menu, from some 20 pastas 
(including two gnocchi dishes) to homemade sausage in wine and tomato sauce, 11 
different pizzas and the more predictable chicken and veal dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Prices top out at $16.95 for dinners, which include salad or soup (a comforting 
chicken with tortellini on both my visits). Hot, crusty rolls can't compete 
with Tony's own focaccia, which proved addictive for our children and myself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homemade Tiramisu 
</P>
<P>
Of the desserts, which include a respectable cheese cake, only the tiramisu is 
homemade. It's served pudding style, heavy on the Amaretto, and arrived at the 
table frozen. As it thawed, the flavors balanced better. 
</P>
<P>
A better choice to top off dinner, I think, is a frothy cappuccino, available 
decaffeinated, nicely topped with chocolate and cinnamon, served with a crisp 
wafer. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, specials of fresh pasta, veal, chicken and fresh seafood, $7.95 
to $10.95, supplement the regular menu. There's a small wine list with Pinot 
Grigio and Chianti available by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Tony and Janina, who were partners in D'Angelo's in Laguna Hills, opened 
Adriano Ristorante a year ago. A few months ago they doubled its size -- 
obviously a wise move, because they had a full house the Thursday I was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriano Ristorante, 3314 S. Bristol, Santa Ana; (714) 957-6909. Open for lunch 
Tuesday-Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; dinner Fridays and Saturdays from 
5 to 10 p.m.; Sunday and Tuesday-Thursday from 5 to 9 p.m. Closed Mondays. Lot 
parking. Reservations, lunch and dinner. Accepts MasterCard, Visa, American

Birmingham 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Chick Epstein, 9th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-7; tied for 3rd in league, 2-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: "As our quarterback goes, we'll go," says Epstein of the 
Braves. That places a lot of responsibility on the left arm of senior Danny 
Larson (6-2, 185), a returning all-league performer who threw for more than 
1,300 yards last year. Who will shoulder the load with Larson is another 
matter. Grant transfer Jake Brescher (6-3, 170) has impressed Epstein at wide 
receiver, and sophomore running back Daryl Moore, the son of former NFL player 
Manfred Moore, will start. Up front, Epstein expects good things out of junior 
center Jason Mansfield (6-3, 180), a second-team all-league selection who will 
play a role in the frequent deployment of the shotgun offense. Mansfield is 
just part of an inexperienced offensive line that includes Shaw Rast (5-11, 
190), Donnell Grey (6-0, 230) and Robert Taracevich (6-0, 210), all starters 
last season. On defense, Epstein is unsure about a defensive line that will be 
composed almost entirely of newcomers. At linebacker, though, is junior Jon 
Zuccaro, an honorable mention all-league selection who also might play 
fullback. Also returning at linebacker is Anthony McComb (6-2, 200). In the 
secondary, Larson, who was an all-league safety as a sophomore, will team with 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We have a lot of inexperience and a lot of kids who will play both 
ways," Epstein said. Larson should have a big year, but Reseda and Monroe are 
major obstacles in the league. "I hope we can -- and should -- do better than 
last year," Epstein said. "We played well in the summer passing league, but 
that doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monroe 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dave Lertzman, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-2; 1st in league, 7-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Like league rival Birmingham, Monroe's fortunes will rest 
heavily on a returning all-league quarterback. The Vikings' man will be senior 
Jesse Wallace (5-11, 195) who, unfortunately for Lertzman, will have trouble 
finding experienced targets. One receiver Lertzman does like is Gerrit Maxwell, 
who broke his collarbone last season. Monroe's only returning offensive lineman 
is senior Gerrard Taft (5-9, 195), who Lertzman calls "the hardest hitter on 
the team." Junior Jason St. John (6-0, 200), a linebacker, also will play 
center. Lertzman will also take a chance at tackle, using sophomore man-child 
Paul Pedroza (6-4 1/2, 290), who has never played before. Another big but 
inexperienced lineman is senior Casey Dugan (6-5, 250). The running game has 
large shoes to fill with the graduation of Curtis Scott (1,943 yards). Lertzman 
will look to second-team all-league linebacker Jim Rose (5-9, 170) to add the 
tailback position to his chores. Junior Fabian Speights (6-0, 200) will round 
out the backfield. On defense, many of the same names appear. Wallace will play 
cornerback and Maxwell will play safety. Rose, St. John and Speights will play 
linebacker. The line will be anchored by senior Tom Taylor (6-0, 200), a 4.0 
student who bench presses 330 pounds. Scott Christenson (6-0, 180), a senior 
who didn't play last year, also will play on the line along with candidates 
Dugan, Pedroza or junior Darnell Lowe (6-3, 200). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Monroe went unbeaten in Valley Pac-8 Conference play last year, but a 
repeat performance will be difficult. Still, with Wallace, the Vikings have a 
shot at winning another title. "We appear to have good athletes. If we go in 
thinking we have a chance, then we'll be competitive," Lertzman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Joel Schaeffer, 12th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-2; 2nd in league, 6-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Schaeffer appears to have another solid if inexperienced 
team, with its strength lying mainly in its linemen. Division I recruit Jason 
Kiederling (6-5, 265), a senior, will keep opposing defensive lines on edge at 
offensive tackle, and senior center Arturo Rodriguez (6-0, 195) also could be a 
force. Guards Edgar Fernandez and Michael Green are Schaeffer's "clones" at 
tackle: Both are 5-10, 190-pound juniors. Reseda is green at the skill 
positions. Schaeffer has tabbed Andre Jackson (5-9, 170) at quarterback. 
Jackson backed up graduated Coley Kyman last year and has no experience 
starting. The Regents will move tight end Donald Johnson (6-1, 205) to 
fullback, but the tailback situation remains uncertain. Joey Tushnet (5-9, 170) 
and Steven Culp (5-10, 170) are the two candidates fighting for the job. 
Schaeffer has confidence in the defense, though, which traditionally is strong. 
Rodriguez and Johnson form a tough tandem at inside linebacker, and Schaeffer 
is high on junior defensive end Marco Mendoza (5-11, 190). Jackson enjoys 
playing outside linebacker "He doesn't want to play quarterback unless I let 
him play defense," Schaeffer said. In the defensive secondary, Rocky Tribble 
(6-3, 200) will play cornerback and wide receiver Herman Williams (6-1, 180) 
will play safety. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Schaeffer knows that it will be an unusual year for the Regents in 
that they are green at the skill positions. "We're going to have to claw and 
scratch for everything we get," he said. "We've got some seedlings that we're 
planting." Considering the fact that Reseda has won 31 of its past 35 games, 
it's likely to be a bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kenji Mochizuki, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-6; 3rd in league, 2-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With 18 starters returning, the Wolves may contend for the 
league title in 1989. Four talented running backs will share time but Mochizuki 
has been impressed by senior Birmingham transfer Diallo Frazier (5-7, 155). 
Joining Frazier in what looks to be a ground-oriented game is senior Tony 
Indecato (6-0, 175), junior Aaron Gadasy (5-5, 140) and sophomore Harold 
Boudeux (6-0, 175). That group will run behind an experienced offensive line: 
all of last year's starters return, including by senior tackle Lae Freeman 
(6-5, 265). He is joined by fellow seniors Edvin Babayovo (6-3, 225, guard), 
Jeremy Gross (6-0, 206, center), Corey Borns (6-0, 235, guard) and Fernando 
Frausto (6-0, 235, tackle). "We're going to win with our line," Mochizuki says. 
The Wolves have a new quarterback in senior Roy Vasich (6-2, 180), last year's 
backup who "has improved quite a bit," according to Mochizuki. Vasich will 
throw to senior wide receiver Cuneyt Karacuha (5-11, 165). The Wolves also 
boast experience on defense, with Babayovo at linebacker and Freeman and 
Frausto as down linemen. Mochizuki is "really high" on junior lineman Jose 
Martinez (5-10, 210). Senior David Hwang (5-11, 170) will anchor the defensive 
secondary at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Van Nuys is playing in a league without a dominating favorite, leaving 
the race wide open. The Wolves have experience on their side, but Mochizuki is 
hesitant to say anything. "I don't like to predict," he said. "I don't know 
what (the rest of the league) has."

Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Myron Gibford, 10th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-8; 4th in league, 1-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The fact that junior Brandon Ruedy (6-0, 190), a 
linebacker-tight end last season, is the team's quarterback should give some 
indication that Gibford is trying to shake up things. "We had to find somebody 
who could do the job," he said. "We were terrible last year." Senior Kyle Beck 
(5-10, 150), who rushed for 136 yards as a reserve last year, is the best of a 
good corps of running backs that also includes seniors Michael Hamilton (6-0, 
160), a converted receiver; Kenya Smith (5-10, 165), a transfer from Kansas; 
and juniors Mukasa Crowe (5-10, 160) and Rayna Stewart (5-9, 165), who will 
come off the bench. "We're going to alternate," Gibford said. Junior tight end 
Keyawn Murphy (5-10, 165) was the best receiver on last year's B team. Senior 
Bobby Hayes (6-0, 240), who returns as center and team captain, is the only 
experienced lineman. Senior linebacker Greg Garrison (6-1, 240) begins his 
third varsity season. Senior defensive back Pat Minooei (5-8, 155), a transfer 
from El Camino Real, is small, "but he is a hitter," Gibford said. Junior 
Delvon Hardaway (5-11, 160) will play defensive back and wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Chatsworth ranked 16th last season both offensively and defensively 
among Valley-area City Section teams. Consequently, Gibford is stressing a 
wide-open attack. "But it's going to be hard," he said. "(A record of) 6-3 is 
going to be a great year for us. Granada Hills and San Fernando are loaded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Darryl Stroh, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-3; tied for 1st in league, 6-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Stroh is up to his whistle in talented skill-position 
players. "We're going to throw the ball a lot better than we did last year," he 
said. Senior Chris Gadomski (175 attempts, 85 completions, 1,158 yards, 4 
touchdowns) didn't fare too badly last season. If Gadomski doesn't measure up, 
junior Brian Martin (6-2, 175), a transfer from Illinois, is ready. "It is 
conceivable that he will start," Stroh said. "We're looking to start the best 
player." Granada Hills has plenty of experience. Among the returning starters 
are senior tailback-defensive back Leon Glasgow (5-9, 175, 372 yards rushing), 
senior wide receivers William Moringlane (6-3, 210, 26 catches, 466 yards) and 
Jermaine Love (6-0, 165, 8 catches, 106 yards, 1 touchdown) and senior guard 
Terence Bito (6-1, 224). Junior running back Brett Washington (6-0, 215, 616 
yards rushing), also a returning starter, probably is the team's fastest 
player. Senior tight end Charles Carpenter (6-1, 185) moves from backup to a 
starting role. Defensively, juniors Derrick Stewart (5-10, 185) and Robert 
Haywood (6-1, 185, 4 interceptions) return in the secondary. Junior nose guard 
Robert Kalinowski (6-0, 215) is the best prospect of a still-to-be-determined 
line. The same goes for the offensive front. "That's really going to be our 
area in question," Stroh said. Senior tackle Bart Barbuscia (6-1, 240) played 
backup last year. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Highlanders are flooded with talent and experience on both sides 
of the line. Stroh likens this year's crew of skill-position players to the 
crop that fashioned a City Section 4-A Division championship two years ago. 
"That's where the talent that we know of is," he said.

PLAYERS TO WATCH: All-conference tailback Ontiwaun Carter (5-11, 175), who 
rushed for 1,190 yards and nine touchdowns and caught 13 passes for 184 yards 
as a sophomore, is one of the best players in the Valley this fall. "He 
electrified people as a 10th-grader," Francola said. "And he's bigger and 
stronger." Senior wide receiver Jason Rosen (5-11, 165) caught nine touchdown 
passes in the L. A. Games this summer. Senior Tony Vasquez (5-11, 170, 36 
attempts, 12 completions, 216 yards, 2 touchdowns), who started at quarterback 
the final three games of last year, will lead a run-and-shoot offense. Sizable 
offensive linemen David Boghossian (6-2, 270) and John Jones (6-2, 275), both 
are seniors and both bench press more than 350 pounds. Junior wing back-safety 
Keith West (6-0, 175), an all-league soccer player, also will be the punter. 
West had five interceptions last year. Senior Ryan McGrath (6-6, 220) will 
start at wide receiver and middle linebacker. Junior defensive back Damon Tice 
(6-0, 190) was the B team's hardest hitter last season. Sophomores Anthony 
Jones (5-10, 160) and Alex Swasky (6-0, 205) are vying for starting positions 
in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Kennedy probably would be the best team in the West Valley League, the 
North Valley's sister league. But competing in the same league with Granada 
Hills and San Fernando is a tough lot. Still, with Carter, Kennedy is capable 
of scoring against anyone from anywhere on the field. "If we can combine a 
running and passing game, we'll be difficult to stop."

COACH: Tom Hernandez, 8th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-4; tied for 1st in league, 6-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Talent abounds offensively. Is there a better all-around high 
school quarterback in the state than senior Michael Wynn (6-3, 205), the 
leading passer among Valley City Section teams last year? Hernandez doesn't 
think so. "He's definitely one of the best quarterbacks in the country," he 
said. Wynn's statistics as a junior: 209 attempts, 108 completions (51.6%), 
1,614 yards, 24 touchdowns. Wynn also rushed for 190 yards in 92 carries. 
Senior tailback-defensive back Maurice McFarland (6-0, 205) rushed for 670 
yards and five touchdowns last year. Senior fullback-linebacker Vincent Hall 
(5-11, 190) also returns as a two-way starter. Seniors Johnny Carter (5-10, 160 
pounds, 14 carries, 79 yards) and Will Taylor (5-11, 170), who rushed for more 
than 1,600 yards with the B team last year, will not be sitting by idly. 
"Basically," Hernandez said, "all these guys will be all over the place." 
Offensive linemen John Ybarra (6-3, 250), a senior, and Rene Acosta (6-2, 245), 
a junior, both played backup last year. Several players graduate to starting 
roles in what Hernandez insists is an "improved" defense. Senior linebacker 
Gilbert Quiroz (5-11, 210) was a second-team all-league selection last year. 
Senior Lance Whitaker (6-8, 260) is new at defensive end. Senior Duane West 
(5-11, 150) and junior Keith Woods (5-11, 160) move to full-time roles in the 
secondary. Senior defensive tackles Victor Hernandez (6-1, 240) and Cornelius 
Chisolm (6-0, 230) both return as starters. Senior linebacker Juan Ochoa (5-11, 
210) transferred from Alemany during last season. Junior Jose Servin (5-10, 
160) was an all-league kicker for the B team last year. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Depth and talent is a tough combination to beat. "We've got them in 
every position," Hernandez said. "We just have a couple of questions where kids 
have to come through." Certainly not where ballhandling is a prerequisite. 
Wynn, a dangerous ballcarrier from the pocket, should emerge as the dominating 
player in the conference.

Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rudy Lugo, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-8; 4th in league, 0-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Lugo praises junior David Erhardt (6-2, 180) as "probably the 
most talented quarterback I've ever seen in high school." Erhardt completed 71 
of 167 passes for 795 yards and four touchdowns last year. But he'll need 
blocking. "Last year, a lot of the time he was running for his life," Lugo 
said. Senior tackle Bob Moose (6-2, 230) is a Division I prospect but might be 
forced to play on defense, too. Senior Doug Kreider (5-9, 175) returns at 
center and is a good pass blocker. Senior wide receiver Reynaldo Gallegos 
(5-10, 150) is elusive and has good hands. Junior Hugo Escamilla (5-8, 180) 
will double as a kicker and fullback. Senior linebacker Elvis Palacios also 
will play at fullback. Twins Dalton and Darrin Payne, both 5-10, 155 and 
juniors, are potential deep threats. Junior guard-linebacker Brian Bolognia 
(5-11, 175), who played on the B team last year, and senior running 
back-defensive end Calvin Williams are typical of several players: They start 
both ways. Explained Lugo: "We're down in numbers." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Canoga Park was outscored, 217-80, last season. Consequently, Lugo is 
stressing ball control. "We're in a pretty tough 4-A league," he said. "You're 
never in easy. We'll have to keep things really simple." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Landress, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-5; 2nd in league, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Look for Cleveland to run the ball with senior tailback Pat 
Bryant (5-11, 185) carrying the load and offensive linemen Curtis Hudson (6-1, 
255), a senior, and Warren Whitaker (5-10, 210), a junior, leading the way. 
Bryant rushed for 276 yards in 46 carries last year in part-time duty. "He is 
as good an athlete as I've ever coached," Landress said. He called Hudson "the 
best guard in the City." Junior Jon Palacio (5-10, 220), senior tackle Dave 
Unger (6-3, 225), a starter last year, and junior tight end Lance Johnson (6-0, 
195) all are strong and should help the Cavaliers' ground attack. Senior 
fullback Lamont Roberson (6-0, 195) moves into a starting role this season. 
Senior flanker Roderick McMillan (5-11, 165), who was ineligible last season, 
is expected to play this fall. Left-hander Steve Bryant (5-11, 180), a senior, 
is the quarterback. On defense, three-year starter Vincent Johnson (5-8, 165) 
heads the secondary and senior Will Johnson III (6-0, 235) is the team's best 
linebacker. Al Martinez (6-2, 220) returns as another starting linebacker. 
Senior nose guard Eric Young (5-7, 235) anchors the line. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Cavaliers have talent but little depth. "It's just going to depend 
on injuries," Landress said. "It wouldn't surprise me if we won the league and 
it wouldn't surprise me -- if a few guys got hurt -- if we wound up on the seat 
of our pants." Pat Bryant and good blocking should be more than enough to lead 
Cleveland into the playoffs.

El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ralph Stam and Mike Maio, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-7; 3rd in league, 2-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Conquistadores are small -- not in numbers but size. 
Center Ed Yates (5-10, 185) returns, as does guard Tony Candella (5-7, 165), 
and both typify the team's undersized front. Senior wide receiver Aaron 
Guerrero (5-6, 138) might be the smallest player in the league. After 
rebounding from consecutive winless seasons, however, the Conquistadores are 
showing a lot of desire, Maio said. "We're small, physically, so we'll have to 
trap and do those kinds of things. We'll have to substitute a lot," Maio said. 
Senior running back Bobby Kim (6-0, 205), who rushed for 173 yards in 47 
carries last year, arguably is the team's best player. Senior Jamal Anderson 
(5-11, 200, 44 carries, 145 yards) and junior Lejon Carr (6-1, 185, 79 carries, 
220 yards) also return at running back. "We'll build the team around them," 
Maio said of the trio. Senior Tony Bordwell (5-9, 150), an inexperienced 
quarterback, completed just one of 13 passes as a backup last year. Junior 
linebackers Troy Snyder (6-0, 210) and Chris Griggs (5-10, 165) both started as 
sophomores. Senior defensive tackle Abdul Zaid (5-10, 220) is the team's 
strongest player. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: A continued upward swing is the Conquistadores' main objective. Early 
indications, Maio said, are positive. "We might be in the best condition on the 
first day of practice than we've ever been," he said. "We feel things are going 
in the right direction." 
</P>

Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Stevenson, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-4; 1st in league, 5-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: How do you replace graduated tailback Kelvin Byrd, who rushed 
for 1,480 yards and 13 touchdowns last year? "You don't," Stevenson said. 
"Hopefully, a new guy will step in and do the job that he did." Senior Steve 
Lockridge (6-2, 200), who rushed for 107 yards as Byrd's backup, will try. 
Lockridge also will return as a starting linebacker. "Nobody will go both ways 
full time," Stevenson said. Senior Edwin Velasco (5-11, 165), quarterback of 
last year's league-champion B team, will lead an "option-oriented" offense. 
Senior Wolfgang Von Aspe (5-11, 190) returns at fullback-inside linebacker and 
senior Gregory Bernard (6-0, 235), who will start as a defensive tackle, also 
will play fullback. Senior Chad Petrilli (5-11, 165) returns at wide receiver. 
Junior Darnell Hendrix (6-2, 190), a transfer tight end and middle linebacker 
from Jefferson, also could draw attention. "He's really going to be 
outstanding," Stevenson said. Senior defensive back Irving Carter (5-10, 200) 
transferred from Antelope Valley. Senior Jason Levine (6-0, 180) and junior 
Greg Levy (6-0, 185) return as offensive linemen, and junior linebacker Vance 
Swendell (5-11, 170) returns at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Toreadors had the most explosive offense among Valley-area City 
teams last season, averaging 308 total yards a game. "We also had a great 
running back," Stevenson said. Without Byrd -- and no proven successor -- the 
offensive load must be shouldered by several players. "I think it's going to be 
a very, very difficult season," Stevenson said. A nonleague opener at Servite, 
an Orange County power, offers proof of that.

Grant 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bill Foster, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-6; 3rd place in league, 2-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Grant has been tabbed by coaches as a team to watch. One good 
reason is the return of senior tailback Shawn Booker (5-11, 165). Booker ran 
for 662 yards and a 5.4-yard average last season and should carry much of the 
offensive load. Booker has an experienced and talented line in front of him, 
led by senior Nick Avila (6-3 1/2, 265), a three-year varsity player at tackle. 
Tight end Anthony Melton (6-0, 235), a converted defensive tackle, should also 
have a big year, according to Foster. Joining that pair on the line are 
returners Seung Rho (6-2, 190), a guard, Miguel Gonzalez (6-1, 210), a junior 
center, and tackle Mark Segal (6-1, 225). At quarterback, Foster has two 
candidates: senior Andy Wells (5-9, 150) and senior Marlowe Lewis (5-10, 165). 
Foster would prefer Wells to win the job to free up Lewis, one of the team's 
best athletes, to play slotback and receiver. Foster also is overseeing a 
battle for the fullback slot between senior Geerson Martinez (5-7, 185) and 
Tony Johnson (5-10, 175). The defense reads like the offensive roster, with 
standouts being Booker and Lewis at cornerback, Avila on defensive line and 
Gonzalez at linebacker. Foster is looking for a big year out of senior safety 
Josh Kesselman (5-10, 150). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "The team I'm really watching for is Grant," said the coach of the 
league favorite, Sylmar's Jeff Engilman. "They could sneak up." Foster shares 
the enthusiasm of his rival. "If we play as a team, and play fundamentally 
sound," Foster said, "We have a good chance to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Fred Grimes, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-6; 2nd in league, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The offensive-backfield situation is a bit jumbled for 
Grimes, but one thing is certain: Senior Mike Lewis (5-11, 175) will be there 
somewhere. Lewis, a first-team all-league selection at safety last year, will 
be looked at as a tailback and a quarterback. "Without a doubt, he's our best 
athlete," Grimes said. Senior Rob Wylie is also being considered for the 
position but Grimes, for all practical purposes, is heading into practice 
without a passer. So the Huskies will run the ball. Senior Gill Kalantirski, a 
starting defensive back, likely will join Lewis in the backfield at fullback or 
tailback. The rest of the Huskies are inexperienced. Seventeen players will 
return for their junior season, one of whom is John Gawronski (6-3, 205), an 
offensive tackle and outside linebacker. Grimes' most experienced lineman is 
Kyu Lee (5-11, 225), who will play offensive guard and nose tackle. Two more 
juniors will be lining up at wide receiver for the Huskies: speedy Leon Gable 
(5-9, 155) and promising Louis Barragan (5-9, 155). But as Grimes says, the 
Huskies will only throw "when we have to." On defense, Grimes speaks highly of 
Gable and Lewis in the secondary and senior Keyin Hayes (6-2, 235) on the line. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Grimes is entering the season with his fingers crossed. "I don't know 
if we can beat anybody," he joked. More seriously, "It depends on how these 
11th-graders come through," he said. "If we stay healthy and keep our heads 
screwed on, we could be OK. If we lose one or two key kids, we could hang it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poly 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Fred Cuccia, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-8; 4th in league, 0-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Poly enters the season in a different state than most other 
City teams: Coach Kevin Kennedy resigned in mid-August, leaving the program 
without a coach. Fred Cuccia was hired Aug. 23 and met with the players for the 
first time that night. It is likely that the first player he met was junior 
Jonathon Campbell (5-10, 175), an all-league performer at safety last season 
who has "blue-chip potential" at running back, according to Kennedy. Campbell 
has a talented backfield mate in senior running back Daruth Thomas (6-2, 190), 
who was ineligible last season. Campbell and Thomas should carry a load, too, 
since Kennedy said he had no candidates for quarterback. When Cuccia does find 
one, he can try to utilize wide receivers Eddie Guerrero, a second-team 
all-league performer, and Carlos Guerra. A green offensive line will be 
anchored by senior John Rosenthal (6-0, 210) who has trimmed down from 230 
pounds with some work in the weight room. Also spending time in the weight room 
was defensive lineman Charlie Lemos (5-11, 220), who likely will play both 
ways. The linebacking corps will feature Brian Butterfield (5-8, 160), whom 
Kennedy called "small, real quick and smart." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: When Cuccia took over the floundering program he didn't even know the 
team's schedule. But that doesn't alter his optimism, even though he has a team 
that went winless in league play last year. "Hey, we're going to be there," he 
said. "We're going to be aggressive and well-conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jeff Engilman, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-4; 1st in league, 5-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Listed as the ninth-best running back in the nation by Super 
Prep magazine, tailback Jerome Casey is one strong reason why Sylmar should 
waltz to another league title. And strong is the operative word. "He's my first 
legit 400-pound bench presser," Engilman said. Add a 6-foot, 185-pound frame 
and breakaway speed (10.7 in the 100) to that strength and you have one of the 
City Section's best backs. Just who will hand Casey the ball is another matter. 
Engilman is studying two candidates at quarterback: junior Danny Terry (5-10, 
160) and sophomore Toby Brookens (6-0, 155). Both are good running 
quarterbacks, but Engilman said that Terry may have the edge coming into 
practice. Meanwhile, a stellar Sylmar receiving corps may be making some news 
of its own. Tight end London Woodfin (6-3, 225) will team with wide receivers 
Stacy Lyons, Joseph Vaughn, Giramar Johnson and Harold Augustus. Lyons (5-10, 
160), a senior being recruited by Division I colleges, runs a 4.4 40, according 
to Engilman, and Vaughn (6-1, 175) is a "great possession receiver." Johnson 
and Augustus are both juniors. A good offensive line, anchored by senior James 
Jackson (6-1, 270), and junior Ken Green (6-2, 225), is still a question mark 
because of its inexperience. On defense, Sylmar's strength lies in its 
secondary, featuring Casey, a standout safety, and Lyons and Vaughn as solid 
cornerbacks. Woodfin, a Division I prospect, should be a force at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I hate to put a thing on us," Engilman said, "but I'd say in the 
league we're the favorites." Don't believe him? Fred Grimes, coach of league 
rival North Hollywood, is a Spartan believer, too. "In our league, it's gotta 
be Sylmar," he said.

Rio Mesa 
</P>
<P>
COACH: John Reardon, 22nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-6; 5th place in league, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Rio Mesa has not had a winning record since 1985, when it 
last advanced to the playoffs, and the once-mighty Spartans have won just seven 
league games since. Reardon sees only one solution: "We need a game-breaker, a 
kid who can rush for a hundred yards-plus a game or someone like that. I think 
you need one to be a championship team. And I don't know if we have one." His 
best bet appears to be tight end and defensive end Zelmer Lee (6-3 1/2, 210), 
who Reardon says has attracted Division I attention. Along the offensive line, 
Eric Paulson (6-2, 225), John Manachio (5-10, 185), Marco Cadena (5-11, 195) 
and Matt McHale (6-2, 215) are the favorites to start. Scott O'Neil (5-9, 185) 
will start at fullback and either Sal Balsano (5-8, 180), Gody Abelera (5-8, 
170) or J.R. Nunnery (5-10, 170) will go at tailback. Senior Henry Wilson 
(5-11, 170), a part-time starter last season, appears to have an edge over 
junior Angel Lopez (5-9, 165) at quarterback. Fred Kim (5-6, 140) or Charlie 
Thompson (6-1, 175) will be the split end. On defense, junior cornerback Sam 
Garcia (6-1 1/2, 207) and senior free safety Myron Hart (5-10, 175) could be 
among Ventura County's best at their positions. Darren Mitchell (6-0, 300), 
Lance Roberts (6-2, 247), Gadiel Plazza (5-11, 200) and Lee will man the front, 
Eric Lopez (5-10, 190) and Gilbert Gutierrez (5-8, 180) are the linebackers and 
Carlos Cendejas (5-9, 170), Jamie Lidel (5-7, 160) and Abelera will join Hart 
in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Reardon, despite nearly resigning his position last spring, is glad to 
be back, if that can be an indication of the Spartans' chances in the league. 
"I'm happy I decided to stay," he said. "Otherwise I'd end up being a sports 
writer or something." That horror aside, Reardon expects to compete along with 
the likes of Santa Barbara, Oxnard and Buena for a playoff spot. "That's our 
goal," he said.

L.A. Baptist 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mark Bates, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-6; 5th in league, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Knights will pull a switch of sorts in their backfield 
this year with senior Chris Robinson (5-10, 170) moving from tailback to 
quarterback and Danny Stepper moving from quarterback to all-purpose back, 
playing flanker and running back. The Knights will run an option offense, and 
junior Colin Van Buren (6-0, 180), last year's fullback, will move to tailback. 
Filling the fullback position will be either Jeff Hampston (6-2, 185) or Joel 
Schlecht. Underlying these offensive changes is the fact that the Knights lost 
most of their linemen to graduation. Returning offensive lineman Alan Vanek 
(5-10, 175) will try to hold the fort. L.A. Baptist looks strong at receiver, 
though, with returning senior Kurt Rayners (5-11, 170) and first-year senior 
John Darby (6-3, 180). On defense, the prognosis is good. Hampston returns at 
linebacker and will team with sophomore Jeff Faller (6-2, 170). In the 
defensive backfield, Stepper and Robinson return. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: In a league with Montclair Prep, the best L.A. Baptist can hope for is 
to be competitive. And that is what the coaching staff is hoping for. "We 
should be able to compete," offensive coordinator Greg Frazier said. "We should 
be in the middle somewhere."

LAST SEASON: 6-5; 1st in league, 4-1

<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Mounties are, quite frankly, dripping with talent. 
Starting with the obvious, there is last year's leading rusher in the Valley 
and, according to Super Prep magazine, the 10th-ranked running back in the 
nation -- Michael Jones (6-2, 205). Giannini calls him "the best player in 
California." Jones alone would be enough to terrorize the Alpha League, but the 
Mounties also will feature another top runner: junior transfer Derek Sparks 
(6-2, 210). Sparks, a fullback, comes with healthy credentials: As a sophomore 
at Banning, he was All-City and the state Sophomore Player of the Year. Add 
another transfer to the backfield, junior option quarterback Leland Sparks 
(5-10, 180) -- Derek's cousin who came from Texas -- and you have one of the 
Valley's most explosive trios. At receiver, Shad Knighton returns from last 
year and is joined by by Chatsworth transfer Jason Blatt (6-2, 225), who will 
play tight end. Montclair Prep boasts a large offensive line led by junior 
Donovan Roy (6-6, 260) and senior Bill Silletti (6-5, 250). Giannini feels that 
junior inside linebacker Neimad Durham (6-2, 225) is one of the league's best. 
Also on defense, look for Leland Sparks to shine at safety. OUTLOOK: The 
Mounties are ranked No. 1 in Division IX in the Southern Section preseason 
poll, so winning the Alpha League should be just one step in what looks like a 
historic year for the school. "I really think that we have the possibility of 
being one of the best teams in the Valley," Giannini said.

COACH: Mike Plaisance, 10th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-2; 2nd in league, 3-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: While he is unsure about the Crusaders' strength at the skill 
positions, Plaisance couldn't be more pleased with his team's situation on the 
lines. With the entire line from an offense that netted more than 3,000 yards 
last year returning, Plaisance will look for big things from senior guard Frank 
Castellucci (5-11, 185), whom he calls a "human highlight film." Said Plaisance 
about center Andy Kaminski (5-10, 252): "He is beyond the shadow of a doubt the 
best center in the league." The Crusaders should also get help from senior 
tackle Manny Albarca (5-10, 186). The skill positions suffer from lack of 
experience, however. Plaisance feels safe he has a future star in sophomore 
tailback Chad Everett (5-9, 150). The quarterback, senior Matt Bates, is 
inexperienced as are his receivers. On his defensive line, though, Plaisance 
touts senior Craig Fromel (6-2, 230) and Brett Wood (6-3, 272). At cornerback, 
newcomer Miles Brown, a sophomore, is "the quickest kid in the school." 
Plaisance says whatever his linebackers lack in strength they make up for in 
brains. Jeff Agnor (5-11, 175) will be a mainstay at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: While Plaisance concedes that Montclair Prep is a runaway on paper, he 
still likes his team. "I'd like to think we have the ability," he said. "I have 
20 question marks at the skill positions. Our bright spot is the lines. It 
depends how well our skill positions -- especially the running backs -- come 
along."

Verdugo Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Charley Mack, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-5; third in league, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Mack coached the B team last year and is bringing many of his 
former players with him to the varsity. Senior Darrell Evans quarterbacked the 
B team last year and will challenge Lance Novak (6-0, 190) for the job. Novak, 
one of the team's top athletes, may move to tight end or play running back. 
Verdugo Hills will emphasize the short passing game, and Joe Letscher, a 
standout two-way player up from the B team, will lead the receiver corps. He's 
small (5-6, 150) but tough. "He won't take no for an answer," Mack said. The 
team's toughest player is senior Mike McDonagh (6-0, 210), who will play 
fullback and anchor the defense at linebacker. Senior Daryl Weber (5-9, 210) 
returns at center. The Dons have half-a-dozen 200-pound players, an improvement 
from last year, but a power game remains out of the question. Said Mack: "We're 
going to rely on small players who are fighters." Mack will try to use a 
two-platoon try to keep his players rested, but with only 60 players in the 
entire program, including the B team, he may not be afforded that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Mack has established lowered expectations for his first year: no 
blowouts. "Our goal is to be competitive and play tough in each game. We want 
players to enjoy the experience and come back next year. I plan on being here a 
while and I want to build a program," he said. Mack also wants to eradicate the 
team's image as a forgotten school. "We want to get away from the attitude that 
Verdugo Hills is out in the middle of nowhere and no one cares about us. We 
don't want other schools to take us for granted."

Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rob Dearborn, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-9; 6th in league, 0-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior quarterback-free safety Robert Hernandez (6-2, 170) 
already has caught the attention of local college scouts. Now he needs to find 
a receiver to catch his passes. Last season, Hernandez threw for 615 yards and 
two touchdowns but had a completion rate of 37% (56 of 151). "Our biggest 
weakness is our receivers," Dearborn said. "Hernandez throws really well, but 
we have no one that can catch." Senior fullback-strong safety Jeff Cox (6-0, 
200), a two-time varsity letterman, was second on the team with 10 receptions 
for 109 yards. Senior tailback-cornerback Tony Upshaw (5-10, 180) has above 
average speed and is the Musketeers' biggest running threat. Senior tackle 
Pedro Lozano (5-11, 230) and senior guard Victor Magdaleno (6-1, 210) are 
Moorpark's strongest and best blockers and should provide better protection for 
Hernandez. Dearborn plans to use them on the strong side and run most of the 
plays in their direction. Defensively, Moorpark has two good inside 
linebackers. Senior Tom Uphoff (5-11, 190) led the team in tackles and was a 
second-team all-league selection. Senior Rick Ray (5-11, 190) is also a 
returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Eventually, Moorpark, which has not won a league championship since 
1941, will compare its roster to those of neighbors Agoura and Thousand Oaks. 
Until then, the Musketeers will continue to experience growing pains. "We 
worked hard in the weight room this summer and played well in passing leagues," 
Dearborn said. "But the biggest thing I was banking on last season was the 
offensive and defensive lines and they didn't do the job. Hopefully, one year 
of experience will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ron Veres, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-2; 2nd in league, 4-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The super class of '89 (Jason Stein, Jess Garner, Gary 
Silverman, etc.) has graduated, leaving Oak Park little behind from last year's 
offense that was seventh best among Southern Section Valley-area schools. Worse 
still, the Eagles have but 12 players on the team. Senior Kent Richter (5-9, 
145), who sat out last season, will be the tailback and has as much speed as 
his predecessor, Stein. Both were members of the school's 400-meter relay team 
that was second in the Southern Section 1-A Division. Senior Carlos Pena (5-10, 
185) earned all-league honors as a two-way lineman and will start at fullback 
and middle linebacker. Junior Mike Stern (6-1, 185) will shift from receiver to 
quarterback. "He saw limited action as our backup QB, but he's an athlete," 
Veres said. He'll have senior Erikk Cass (6-1, 175), senior Mike Devine (5-11, 
165), junior Chris Ruhle (5-11, 165), and sophomore Jeff Gibbons (5-10, 165) 
for targets. None has caught a pass on the varsity level. Strong 
tackle-defensive end Aaron Majors (6-2, 195) and guard-defensive tackle Adam 
Jones (5-10, 150) are the returning starters on the front line. Juniors Zach 
Siciliano (6-2, 190) and Chris Kelly (6-1, 175) and sophomore Mike Banks (6-1, 
185) are the other linemen. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: This will be the third consecutive season in which the Eagles have had 
fewer than 25 players on their roster, but that hasn't separated them from 
success. Since Veres has taken over, he has compiled a 17-6 record, and twice 
guided Oak Park to the playoffs. Before his arrival, the Eagles had trouble 
winning one game. Team speed will again be the key to their success. "The 12 
kids we have are pretty good players," Veres said. "With a little bit of luck 
and no injuries, we could do all right."

CLINIC OFFERS PARENTS CLASS TO MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A clinic in Highland Park has become the setting for an experimental program to 
teach low-income, Spanish-speaking Mexican-American parents the skills they 
need to care for their infants. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern Parents," or "Padres Modernos," is a Spanish-language version of a 
10-week program called Minnesota Early Learning Design (MELD), developed in 
1973 to teach parenting skills to middle-income Caucasian families and used in 
90 cities throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Carnegie Corp., the James Irving Foundation and Stuart Foundations are 
paying for a four-year, $500,000 pilot program to adapt the curriculum to 
low-income Mexican-Americans who do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Park, with its heavy Mexican-American population, was identified by 
MELD as an ideal setting for the experiment. Northeast Community Clinic on 
Figueroa Street, which already provided medical, legal and psychological 
assistance to nearby residents, agreed to give "Padres Modernos" a try. 
</P>
<P>
MELD officials say little or no research has been done on Latino parenting 
programs that concern children younger than 2 years old, and they hope to fill 
this void by developing a culturally specific curriculum that can identify and 
correct developmental problems in the early stages of the infant's life. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the third group of the pilot project got under way. Participants 
sat on folding chairs, forming a circle in the clinic's small classroom -- two 
couples expecting their first children, a pregnant woman, a young mother, two 
social workers and volunteer Toni Valdez, a mother of eight who acted as 
discussion leader. 
</P>
<P>
After a round of introductions, Valdez reminded the group why they were meeting 
with the social workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of information from the American psychologists and sociologists 
that we can use, mixed with what we've learned from our experience," Valdez 
said in Spanish. "We have always adapted to different customs in order to 
survive, without losing touch with our roots. That's why we are 'Modern 
Parents,' " she said. The participants nodded and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Abuse 
</P>
<P>
The subject of this meeting was child abuse. Valdez asked Maria Santana, one of 
the MELD social workers, to talk about sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual abuse by parents, baby-sitters and relatives is more prevalent than most 
people suspect, Santana explained. "Know your babies' bodies," she warned the 
parents. "Open their little legs, look for bruises and watch for abnormal 
behavior too, like excessive crying or if the baby is afraid of somebody. 
Sometimes rapists don't leave marks." 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, they talked about different forms of sexual, physical and verbal 
child abuse and how to prevent it. Santana and Eddy Farias, the social workers, 
identified the problems. Valdez, a feisty, talkative and often funny figure, 
interjected anecdotes from her own experiences and told of some mistakes she 
made in raising children. The parents seemed at ease. Slowly, they began asking 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes one baby is darker than another, and people treat them differently," 
Adelina Verdugo said. "Some people think the one with the lighter skin will be 
smarter and better looking. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, Farias replied. This kind of inadvertent discrimination is just as 
dangerous as it is prevalent. The darker child suffers from a lack of 
self-esteem, and the lighter child may feel that he cannot fulfill his parents' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the difference between the way American parents raise their children 
and the Mexican way of doing it?" Antonio Zepeda asked. 
</P>
<P>
American parents tend to stress individualism and personal achievement, whereas 
in Mexico there is more emphasis on the unity of the extended family, Farias 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role of Church 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the Catholic Church plays a bigger role in the education process 
in Mexico, with the local priest often serving as the family adviser. In the 
United States, on the other hand, religion is more focused on satisfying 
spiritual needs, Farias said. 
</P>
<P>
These are precisely the type of questions that the "Padres Modernos" curriculum 
needs to address before it is fully developed and ready to use, said Karen 
Leaf, MELD evaluation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is not to tell parents what's right and what's wrong, but to analyze 
and examine both cultures so parents can choose what values to pass on to the 
child. We want to empower parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a group of parents that traditionally has not a received a lot of 
attention from service providers or the academic community," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The MELD method combines the professional experience of trained child-care 
experts with the practical experience of a "volunteer parent coordinator" whose 
role is to bridge the cultural gap between the experts and group participants 
by relating the discussion topics to anecdotes and personal experiences that 
group members can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Leaf said, the "Padres Modernos" experience has proven at least one 
thing: that the need for such a program exists. "One of the biggest questions 
we had was whether people would come voluntarily, and we've discovered that, 
yes, people really want it and need it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in no small part to Farias' extensive recruiting efforts in churches, 
clinics and schools, about 40 parents have participated in the program to date. 
More importantly, most have stayed in touch after the sessions, Farias said. 
"They are developing a support system similar to the one that was traditionally 
provided by the extended family, which, in most cases, remains behind in Mexico 
when a young couple immigrates to the U. S." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Experts 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the input from its Los Angeles-based staff, MELD has asked a 
range of Latino experts to comment on the curriculum draft -- a series of 
booklets that illustrate and address such topics as "The Baby Plays" and "Child 
Security and Emergencies" -- and has interviewed 150 young Mexican-American 
parents. Plans are under way to kick off a "Padres Modernos" program in the 
Northeast Valley Health Corp. in Pacoima to complement the one already in place 
in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did is link up with Hispanic agencies and community leaders," said Ann 
Elwood, MELD executive director. "We took our technical skills and combined 
them with their cultural and environmental skills." 
</P>
<P>
Elwood hopes that once the curriculum is developed, it can be made available 
nationwide at a cost of $30,000 to $60,000 to schools, churches and community 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Smith, a spokeswoman for the Carnegie Corp. -- the main funder of the 
pilot program -- said the possibility of developing a national curriculum for a 
neglected group was what prompted Carnegie to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"As a national foundation, we're interested in early-childhood programs for 
low-income groups, and we're particularly interested in potential for much 
wider application," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The MELD program "will help us know if this type of curriculum can be useful to 
the community and to Hispanics throughout the country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Valdez, for one, is a believer already. "Sometimes I look back at the way 
I raised my children, and it's a miracle that they are still healthy," she said 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
For example, "when their nose bled, I made them lie down on their stomachs 
until they got all the blood out of their system, like my grandma taught me. 
Years later, when I took a first aid class, I found out I was supposed to do 
the exact opposite. I said, 'Oh my God! How could I ever do something like 
that?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's important to read, to be informed and to attend discussions 
like today's. Because even people who don't have an education, they listen and 
some things rub off on them."

SALVATION ARMY MAY JOIN PROJECT ON HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advocates for the homeless suffered a major defeat this week in efforts to 
build a housing project outside the Ventura city limits, but immediately turned 
to the Salvation Army to discuss the possibility of building a shelter 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Project Understanding and the Salvation Army might join 
forces was raised just 24 hours after the Ventura City Council rejected a 
proposal to build a transitional housing project on county land two miles north 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Almost in shock at the surprise City Council action -- taken after city 
officials balked at meeting county requirements that they guarantee water to 
the project for 60 years -- Project Understanding officials at first denounced 
the council vote as a "devastating setback" for the homeless in Ven tura. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Driskell, executive director of Project Understanding, telephoned Salvation 
Army Capt. Ed Patterson on Tuesday, however, after being informed by local 
Salvation Army board members that the organization might be willing to add its 
resources to the hunt for a local shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Under a tentative plan to be discussed by Driskell and Patterson in coming 
weeks, the Salvation Army might provide space for some housing units for the 
homeless at its Community Center at 155 S. Oak St. in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Project Understanding's contribution to the joint project would include 
construction costs, to come from a $200,000 grant already provided by the City 
Council on condition that the poverty agency find a suitable site in the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army, which had unsuccessfully bid for that grant earlier this 
year, emphasized this week that any future involvement with Project 
Understanding is at a preliminary stage and must be approved by the Salvation 
Army's state leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Patterson said, his organization could initially provide about 10 
beds for the homeless at its present location and could expand that after 
moving next year into a new site in East Ventura at Henderson and Petit roads 
if a decision is made to join Project Understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important factor in joining with Project Understanding would be the 
cooperation of agencies that would be produced," Pat terson said. "Second is 
the fact that they have the money, while we have the building. Third would be 
the opportunity of pooling our resources in this effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to hash this over internally first," Patterson added. "If we were to 
go ahead, we could start with a 10-bed capacity by building onto our present 
location, and gradually expand when we move. I would say ultimately we could 
provide transitional housing for maybe 10 families and 10 to 15 single men and 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Although any possible site for the homeless remains subject to City Council 
approval, initial reaction from council members to the prospect of the 
Salvation Army's involvement in the effort was favorable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has 'Most Experience' 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jim Monahan, who favored the Salvation Army over Project Understanding 
when the council was first debating the matter, said the Salvation Army has the 
most experience in operating homeless facilities, and he voiced some support 
for an Oak Street site. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where you go, you are going to have some opposition," Monahan said. 
"But I think a shelter can work there. I'm not going to rubber-stamp whatever 
they want, but they are probably the best-equipped group to do this sort of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Also praising the prospect of a joint venture was Councilman Richard Francis, 
who stunned Project Understanding officials Monday by leading the council 
turn-around on the issue of build ing a housing project just off Ventura Avenue 
at Bard Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the idea of Project Understanding working with the Salvation Army," 
Francis said. "Project Understanding has a great track record of genuine 
concern for the poor, but they are naive politically. The Salvation Army has 
more political acumen and probably could pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
Francis, one of the council's most vocal supporters of Project Understanding's 
earlier efforts to find a site for the homeless somewhere in the Ventura area, 
introduced the council motion killing the proposed county site after the issue 
of a 60-year guarantee of city water for the project was raised during a 
meeting last week called by Ventura County Supervisor Susan La cey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Described 
</P>
<P>
Project Understanding had proposed building about 100 units of transitional 
housing on 4.5 acres of a decaying lemon orchard on the city's outskirts. The 
land would have been donated to the group by developer Richard Komorowski on 
condition that the City Council give him the right to build 77 houses on an 
adjoining 21 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Though several council members had voiced unhappiness with Komorowski's 
handling of the proposal -- the developer at first had of fered 25 acres to 
Project Understanding and proposed building 25 homes -- the council was leaning 
toward support of the project until county officials raised the water issue. 
</P>
<P>
County officials specifically objected to the language of the city's so-called 
"will-serve" letters, routinely submitted to the county for projects outside 
the city limits, promising a supply of city water only as long as there is not 
some emergency situation requiring that water be preserved for city residents 
exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Lacey, who later said she was surprised that the issue became a 
reason for dropping the project, said her only purpose in calling the meeting 
was to alert city officials that the county felt a stronger pledge of water 
services was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Promise Surmised 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of city staff officials and council members, however, was that the 
city was being told essentially that no project would be approved in the county 
without a firm promise of city water. Their decision was that no exception 
should be made for any project, including one for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Water was the issue," Francis said. "I wish there were other ways to approach 
the problem. The only way we could have promised water to that project was if 
we could have annexed the area as part of the city, and that is impossible 
because there is an oil field between us and them -- and the oil company 
doesn't want to be part of the city." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm not here to change long-term city policies. We have a serious 
water crunch in Ventura. As important as it is to find someplace for the 
homeless, the water issue takes precedence. We just can't promise water to 
people outside the city that eventually may be desperately needed by people who 
are actual residents."

MONTEREY PARK OKS PLAN TO REDO ATLANTIC SQUARE MALL;

<P>
COUNCIL APPROVES PROJECT DESPITE COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORS

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years after work began on the idea and months after residents first 
raised detailed arguments against the plans, the City Council on Tuesday 
approved a major overhaul of Atlantic Square Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of votes taken after eight hours of debate Monday and Tuesday 
nights, the council granted Champion Development Inc. of Long Beach approval 
for the $27-million to $30-million project. It will be a joint venture with the 
city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Fulfill Pledges 
</P>
<P>
"This project will enhance Monterey Park . . . and become one of (the city's) 
richest assets," Mayor Patricia M. Reichenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say the project on South Atlantic Boulevard at Floral Drive 
will fulfill their pledges to restore a quality, general interest shopping 
center to the city, which in recent years has lost a number of restaurants and 
department and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
As the revamped center provides added variety in shopping, Councilwoman Judy 
Chu said, it will also boost the city's sagging sales tax base. Monterey Park 
has among the lowest returns per capita on sales tax in the San Gabriel Valley. 
City officials say that is because residents shop at malls in Montebello, 
Arcadia and West Covina. In the last year, Monterey Park also lost its biggest 
generator of sales tax, a car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited and we took a lot of effort to create a 
pedestrian-friendly shopping center," developer Bob Champion told the council. 
But he said, "'It's been a long, arduous road to get here." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Mark Lewis said, "This project resembles, just barely, the project 
that was originally submitted." 
</P>
<P>
Based largely on complaints from neighbors of the center, the developer made 
dozens of revisions in the original plans. Even Monday and Tuesday, 12 
residents criticized the plans, on which the Planning Commission had attached 
more than 70 specific requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an outhouse back in Minnesota that looked better than (those plans), 
and we also had part of the universe on it. We had a moon on the door," 
resident Len Gustafson told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Champion seemed to take the criticism in stride, saying: "As a developer, it is 
our goal to get overall acceptance by as many people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Criticisms have varied from concerns about traffic, parking, pollution and 
congestion to placement of trash bins, truck delivery locations and walkways. 
"We have a right to ask questions," resident Lucy Ammeian told the council 
Tuesday. "We just want the best for our community." 
</P>
<P>
The plans call for a Mediterranean-style center, with fountains, arches and 
tree-lined walkways. City officials say construction may begin as soon as 
January, with a completion date of Thanksgiving 1990. The city still must buy 
the center from Mex-Am Shopping Centers. 
</P>
<P>
In the plan, Champion will double the size of the supermarket and include 
additional anchors of a drug store, sporting goods store and a major 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the changes, Councilman Christopher F. Houseman said, "I have big 
concerns about this." Houseman said he still thought Champion had not ensured 
the center will be revived in the manner the city and nearby residents deserve. 
He was the only council member to vote against major approvals required for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Councilman's Situation 
</P>
<P>
Houseman's involvement and his possible conflict of interest became part of the 
debate. At the beginning of Monday's meeting, the council adjourned to a closed 
session. Assistant City Atty. Stephanie Scher said later that she advised 
Houseman not to participate in discussions on Atlantic Square, except as a 
private citizen in the audience, because of two possible conflicts of interest: 
</P>
<P>
Houseman acknowledged that, during the last year he had received a consumer 
loan from MPR Auto and Truck Repair, which is owned and, in part, operated by 
Stephen Tan, a member of the Planning Commission. Tan, also in the insurance 
business, owns insurance offices in a shopping center across the street from 
Atlantic Square and therefore, Scher said, could be directly affected by the 
economics of the shopping center project. Tan has consistently excused himself 
in Planning Commission deliberations about Atlantic Square. 
</P>
<P>
Scher said she also was troubled by comments Houseman made at a contentious 
Planning Commission meeting that lasted until 3:15 a.m. July 14. At that 
meeting, the commission voted 3 to 0 to approve the project. After that 
meeting, three planning commissioners wrote the city manager, saying they 
believed Houseman "has prejudged the matter and therefore has disqualified 
himself from voting on the case." 
</P>
<P>
Houseman refused to stay out of the debate. He said the California Fair 
Political Practices Commission had advised him that only "a very limited and 
very strained" interpretation of its rules would suggest he not vote on the 
Atlantic Square project. "I know I don't have any conflict or financial 
conflict" as far as the loan goes, Houseman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his opposition before the Planning Commission referred only to the 
project "as it was at that time. In no stretch of the imagination was that 
prejudging or showing bias. I urged (the Planning Commission) not to rush into 
a decision in the wee hours of the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Scher told Houseman it was his decision whether to vote, and she advised the 
council to give no more weight to his comments than to a member of the 
audience.

STATE PILES TAINTED SOIL NEAR FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has dumped 2,000 tons of 
lead-contaminated soil on an embankment near the Ventura Freeway about 10 miles 
north of Ventura instead of hauling it to an Oxnard landfill as required by 
county environmental health authorities, a county spokesman said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The soil, which came from a canyon in the hills above the Rincon, was part of 
up to 12,000 tons of contaminated earth that the county had ordered shipped to 
the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard three years ago in a major environmental 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
But a Ventura County environmental inspector, acting on a tip, followed a truck 
hauling soil from the canyon and discovered that Caltrans was instead dumping 
truckloads of soil in a dirt area between the Old Rincon Highway and the 
Ventura Freeway about half a mile north of the Mobil Oil Corp. pier. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce W. Dyar, Caltrans regional manager for Ventura, said he ordered the 
dumping on a temporary basis. Dyar said he planned to transfer the soil to the 
Oxnard landfill within several days. 
</P>
<P>
Dyar said he ordered the dirt dumped there because a contract with a trucking 
company to haul the waste was about to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The county counsel's office is reviewing the dumping with environmental health 
officials, but declined to say whether it would recommend the imposition of 
penalties against CalTrans. 
</P>
<P>
The county has ordered Caltrans to remove the material from the site near the 
freeway and ship it to Bailard. That cleanup will continue into next week. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Gilday, a county Environmental Health Division spokesman, said the soil 
is contaminated with low levels of lead that probably would not create a health 
hazard for passing bicyclists and others in the area. No residences are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the dumping posed "a potential hazard to ground water and surface 
water." The ocean water near the pier is a popular surfing spot, Gilday said, 
and rains could cause the lead to trickle into the ocean or underground water 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
"The proper place for it is in a well-managed landfill where there's lots of 
controls to keep it from escaping into the environment," Gilday said. 
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized dumping was discovered Aug. 22 after county environmental 
health authorities went to the Rincon Canyon area to check on the cleanup of 
another unauthorized dump site that may date back 30 years, Gilday said. 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, the county discovered that Caltrans and the state Parks 
and Recreation Department had been dumping brush clippings and waste from roads 
and highways in the remote canyon, Gilday said. The clippings were contaminated 
with high levels of lead from car exhaust and in turn were contaminating the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
The county ordered the dumping stopped and told Caltrans and the state parks 
department to clean up the site. Since then, 10,000 tons have been transported 
to Bailard. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was coordinated by Shell Oil Co. and Conoco. The oil companies 
agreed to get involved "purely from a P.R. point of view," said Susan King, an 
environmental affairs coordinator at Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
Both oil companies deny that they ever dumped anything on the site, which is 
owned by Cynthia Wood, the Santa Barbara heiress on whose property California 
State University wants to build a Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
But Shell once held an oil and gas lease on the site, and Shell and Conoco both 
used the land to gain access to other fields that they leased in the area, said 
officials with both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Shell and Conoco have also agreed to terrace the Rincon Canyon site and replant 
it with native vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said cleanup of the canyon site has been completed. Final soil 
samples will determine whether any contaminated earth remains.

CITY ATTORNEY'S SURPRISE DECISION TO RESIGN STUNS POMONA COUNCIL

<P>
City Atty. Patrick Sampson is resigning after 16 years of service, a move some 
council members attributed to sweeping changes by a new council majority and 
bitter dissension among city officials over those changes. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson announced his intention to leave City Hall at the beginning of Monday 
night's City Council meeting, surprising council members, who said they had no 
prior knowledge of his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said the news was "earth-shaking. . . . You've 
been here for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson offered no explanation for his plans, merely telling the council: "I've 
always believed it has been a privilege to work for the city." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, the 52-year-old graduate of UCLA Law School evaded 
questions about his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any comments about the council or the city," Sampson 
said. "I don't want to criticize; I don't want to praise." 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues, however, were quick to cite recent council actions -- including 
the elimination of three top-level administrative positions and the firing of 
former City Administrator A. J. Wilson -- as reasons for Sampson's departure. 
The actions, they said, have created an atmosphere of divisiveness and 
antagonism that has become commonplace at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson is the second high-ranking city employee to resign this month. Former 
City Planner Konradt Bartlam left his post Aug. 17 to work for the city of 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overhaul' Urged 
</P>
<P>
The resignations followed suggestions by the council majority -- Bryant, Nell 
Soto and Tomas Ursua -- for a complete overhaul of the redevelopment staff and 
other city departments. At a recent meeting, Bryant said staff members should 
be reviewed individually to determine whether they should be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just pass it off as a coincidence," Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer 
said. "It's not a coincidence. There's a new majority and some kind of a new 
direction. I think the staff is concerned and, to a certain extent, rightfully 
so." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant acknowledged that because of "cost-saving" actions the council majority 
took, "there is reason for department people to be apprehensive if they've been 
classed among the deadwood. (Sampson) may have felt insecure and applied that 
to his job, but I don't know how that would affect him. There is nothing in the 
new majority to make him feel threatened." 
</P>
<P>
"That man was indefatigable," Bryant added. "He had answers to hairy problems. 
He gave sound and concrete advice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputy to Serve 
</P>
<P>
Sampson said he has no definite career plans. He intends to spend time with his 
wife and two sons and travel to London to visit his daughter. He said he may 
return to teaching local government law at the University of La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Upon Sampson's departure, Deputy City Atty. Bill Curley will serve as interim 
city attorney while the council searches for a permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Sampson became the first city attorney to enter the position as a 
council appointee. His predecessor, Robert C. Gustaveson, was elected in 1963 
and then appointed in 1965 when the City Charter was changed to make the post 
appointive. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson first worked as deputy under Gustaveson for 10 years, at the same time 
working part time at private firms in La Verne and Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his tenure with the city, Sampson said he has taken a 
conservative approach to his position, rarely crossing the "very fine line" 
separating strictly legal advice from political advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some city attorneys have become involved in policy areas. We find this more 
with elected city attorneys, who seem more likely to cross over into the 
policy-making area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Arlo E. Rickett Jr., who preceded Gustaveson, was asked by the 
City Council to resign in 1951 for failing to carry out the spirit and intent 
of his office. In one case, Rickett refused to sign an agreement with the 
Metropolitan Water District, a decision Sampson said stemmed from personal 
objections rather than a professional opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an example of a city attorney doing something beyond the scope of his 
powers," Sampson said. "He was criticized for that. Gustaveson ran against that 
type of philosophy and won." 
</P>
<P>
But on several occasions, Bryant has criticized Sampson for refusing to take 
any risks. 
</P>
<P>
"I would become agitated and say, 'Don't tell me what we can't do; tell me what 
we can do,' " Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Took Job Seriously' 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said Sampson "wasn't a high-profile city attorney. That may have been 
an irritation to some people. But he took the job seriously. He was an 
excellent research attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer praised Sampson for the work he did in helping to defend the city 
against charges that its at-large election system discriminated against Latinos 
and blacks. At the time, only two Latinos, and no blacks, had ever been elected 
to the City Council. A federal judge ruled in favor of the city, and a circuit 
court recently upheld the ruling after it was appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson said the case will probably stand out as the most memorable in his 
16-year tenure, because he was put in the position of collecting evidence to 
defend the at-large system but believed that residents should have the final 
say about what system is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
"I had suggested very early on in the process that voters should select 
whatever voting scheme they wanted, and recommended to the council that they 
put it on the ballot," Sampson said. "I have always felt that even in the 
absence of discrimination, a federal judge has no right to tell citizens how to 
elect people. I think eventually it will be put on the ballot."

TRAVEL COSTS FOR COLLEGES FLY TOO HIGH, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Community College District's proposed budget allows an 
expenditure of more than $100,000 for travel by administrators and trustees -- 
nearly twice the sum they spent just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The $57.8-million budget is to be considered by the district's Board of 
Trustees at their meeting Tuesday, and the travel expenses are almost certain 
to spark a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
While some administrators and board members argue that attending seminars and 
conferences is both necessary and justified, two trustees have questioned the 
frequency of the trips. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Greg Kampf, who joined the board in July, said he is "a bit suspicious 
of the amount of money" proposed for travel. He said he would ask for "a full 
accounting of exactly what kinds of conferences and who's doing the travel." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Hirschberg, a trustee since 1987, was more critical. He said the 
district's "ballooning, runaway" travel budget reflects skewed priorities, 
diverting money from education to unnecessary trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travel Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Administrators are "crisscrossing the country in search of conferences," he 
charged. "It's been my impression over the last year that a lot of the 
administrators have been away from their desks a little bit too much. They're 
more valuable to us here . . . being available to the students and the staff 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Hirschberg's comments angered board President Tom Ely. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick on travel," he said. "It sounds like everybody's going out and partying 
and attending conferences with funny hats and noisemakers and drinks. It's not 
that kind of thing in any regard." 
</P>
<P>
Such trips actually have benefited the district by "millions and millions of 
dollars," said Ely, a 10-year trustee. He said the benefits stemmed from 
staying on top of pending legislation and keeping abreast of cost-cutting 
measures instituted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized Hirschberg's claims as dishonest and one-sided, contending that 
travel expenditures are a convenient target for someone bent on political 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the district spent $55,000 of its $75,700 budgeted travel allowance 
for some 60 employees, including its six trustees. The expenses ranged from 
mileage for trips between Ventura, Moorpark and Oxnard colleges to air fare, 
hotel and restaurant bills for trips to Washington and Sacramento to meet with 
legislators. The following year, the district spent $76,047 of its $93,000 
travel budget. It proposes a $101,895 travel budget for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$21,100 for Trustees 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget earmarks $21,000 in travel expenses for the trustees and 
$12,400 for Chancellor Barbara A. Derryberry. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Orange County's Coast Community College District has budgeted 
$5,640 in travel for Chancellor Alfred Fernandez for the 1989-90 year, less 
than half Derryberry's allowance. However, a Coast district spokesman said, 
some of Fernandez's travel during the year is paid by other educational 
organizations that he represents. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Community College District, a three-college district with almost 20,000 
more students than the 31,000 in the Ventura County district, has also budgeted 
only $12,000 in travel for its trustees, compared to the $21,000 proposed for 
the Ventura County district. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kimberling, Ventura's vice chancellor of administrative services, defended 
the administrators' travel increases, pointing to the board's decision to 
create the new position of executive vice chancellor and an $8,800 infusion in 
state funds earmarked for travel. Apart from those developments, the district's 
proposed travel budget hasn't increased at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's budget is . . . essentially identical to the same level we 
experienced in 1988-89," Kimberling said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberling also said the $55,000 figure for the 1987-88 year was artificially 
low because trustees voted that year to limit their travel expenses to $1,000 
each. That decision was made because of conflict on the board over allegedly 
excessive travel expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figure Doubted 
</P>
<P>
Derryberry said her proposed travel budget was not out of line. She said she 
doubted that Fernandez, Ventura's chancellor before leaving for Coast, could 
get by with just the $5,640 budgeted by the Coast district. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going on at Coast, but you're not getting the right 
information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts larger than Ventura spend less on travel, but their locations 
help make travel less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Rios Community College District in Sacramento, the budget calls for 
$6,000 for the chancellor's travel expenses and $14,000 for the eight-member 
board. That three-college district has 70,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Community College District Chancellor Hilary Hsu cautioned 
against "comparing apples with oranges." That district's seven board members 
spent just $5,000 for travel last year, but they drive to meetings in 
Sacramento, rather than fly, and do less overall driving than their 
counterparts in Southern California, Hsu said.

1ST TENANT CITED UNDER RENT LAW PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A former West Hollywood tenant who faced up to 12 years in prison and $30,000 
in fines for lying to the city's Rent Stabilization Commission pleaded guilty 
to a lesser charge this week, ending the city's first prosecution of a tenant 
under its tough, 4-year-old rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Gelvin, 33, of Los Angeles pleaded guilty Tuesday to one felony charge 
of "making, possessing and uttering a fictitious instrument, to wit, a check" 
while seeking a $25 rent reduction before the commission in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin had faced three felony charges for preparing false documentary evidence, 
submitting false documentary evidence and perjury under oath before Tuesday's 
preliminary hearing. Each felony carries a maximum four-year prison term and 
$10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Repay Costs 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely will send a message that the rent control law applies equally 
to landlords and tenants," said prosecutor Iver Bye, deputy district attorney 
for Los Angeles County. Bye spoke after Gelvin entered his plea at a 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plea bargain agreement worked out in Beverly Hills Municipal Court, 
Gelvin will serve three years of probation and reimburse West Hollywood for 
costs incurred in its investigation, estimated at $5,000, said Bye. The maximum 
sentence for the felony is a three-year jail term and $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin is the first tenant to face criminal prosecution under West Hollywood's 
law, but at least two dozen landlords or their agents have been prosecuted 
since the law was enacted in 1985. The city, where an estimated 85% of 
residents are renters, last year began a "get tough" policy against rent 
control violators. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin's lawyer said at the time of his client's arrest and arraignment in May 
that city officials sought to make an example of him. But he praised county 
prosecutors Tuesday for their fair treatment of the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the agreement was a fair disposition," said Charles R. English, 
partner in the Santa Monica firm of Chaleff &amp; English. "It was a stupid, 
irresponsible act on behalf of my client, and he's very remorseful about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bit of Overkill' 
</P>
<P>
English, a criminal defense lawyer and president-elect of the Los Angeles 
County Bar Foundation, had called the original charges and penalties against 
Gelvin "a bit of overkill." Gelvin refused comment and referred questions to 
his attorney. English said his client worked as a manager for a Los Angeles 
company that he declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
City officials denied that they singled Gelvin out as an example to other 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think his actions speak for themselves. It wasn't so much (that Gelvin 
was prosecuted because he was a tenant). Mr. Gelvin was prosecuted because his 
actions came before the attention" of the rent board, said Steven H. Rosenblit, 
West Hollywood city prosecutor, after Gelvin's plea. 
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely no desire to make an example of anybody. This was simply 
an alleged felony that we discovered that we then submitted to the district 
attorney's office," said a West Hollywood rent commission hearing examiner at 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin admitted falsifying personal checks while attempting to reduce his $548 
monthly rent two years ago before the Rent Stabilization Commission, when he 
accused his landlord of eliminating one of two parking spaces to which he was 
entitled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rent Reduced 
</P>
<P>
At that time, a hearing examiner reduced Gelvin's rent at his 949 Larrabee St. 
apartment by $10 a month, after Gelvin presented several canceled checks with 
notations indicating that the rent check included money for "extra parking." 
</P>
<P>
But Gelvin appealed the decision, insisting he was entitled to a $25 reduction. 
During the appeal, the landlord, Ashkenazy Management Co., presented bank 
photocopies of the checks Gelvin had offered at the earlier hearing that did 
not contain the notations. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Gelvin admitted that he entered notations on some checks after they 
were cashed to make it appear that he was paying for the extra parking space. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a thoughtless act that he's paying substantially for, but that's life," 
said English. 
</P>
<P>
Bye, the prosecutor, said mitigating factors led to the reduced charge. 
According to Bye, some of the checks Gelvin submitted to the rent commission as 
evidence in 1987 included authentic notations of parking payments. Gelvin 
apparently falsified others in the belief that he was clarifying the payments, 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
It also was taken into account that Gelvin has no criminal record, Bye said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the negotiated felony charge, Gelvin also has the option of requesting 
that his conviction be reduced to a misdemeanor if he meets probation 
requirements, Bye said, an option not allowed under the original charges. 
</P>
<P>
Formal sentencing was set for Sept. 19 by Municipal Judge Judith O. Stein, who 
presided over Tuesday's hearing.

GRAFFITI KING WHO FOUND A WAY TO MAKE HIS TALENT PAY EXPLAINS THE LURE OF BARE 
WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Matthew C. Dunn has done some "burningest" pieces in his time, but his days as 
a Los Angeles graffiti king are, for the most part, behind him. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Venice resident now holds a grown-up's job as a computer 
graphics designer. Graffiti are strictly a sideline these days, and a 
commercial one at that -- his work has appeared in advertisements in Rolling 
Stone, Sports Illustrated and L.A. Style magazines. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Dunn, who boasts of having once stolen 75 cans of spray paint at a 
time, will "burn" a graffiti "piece" on your baby's bedroom wall -- for a 
price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Streets 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a gang of one," said Dunn, brash and affable. "I've always done pretty 
much what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
To encounter Dunn is to encounter a grown-up version of the hundreds of 
graffiti "taggers" and gang-member look-alikes who roam Los Angeles each night, 
engaging in an activity that will cost the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District alone $8 million this year in cleanup costs for its buses and 
buildings. But grown up or not, he retains strong ties to the street and 
remembers with affection the nights of his youth spent with his graffiti crew. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it for fun and fame," said Dunn, dressed in sweat-top and knee-split 
jeans after a day of computer design work at a Beverly Hills travel agency. 
And, although he has shaken the habit -- turning instead to steady work, a 
girlfriend and a lucrative graffiti-painting hobby -- he sees little evidence 
that many other painters will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn grew up in a middle-class Westside neighborhood and attended Culver City 
High School and Santa Monica College. There, he toyed with the punk-rock 
movement, break-dancing and rap music. Members of his old graffiti group still 
work in music, art and dance across California and in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at a kitchen table in the Venice house he shares with two roommates and 
their dog, Dunn leafs through his portfolio, a set of Polaroid photographs and 
a pile of his graffiti sketch books, the vital ledgers he used to measure his 
life's work as recently as two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people live for this," he said, showing dozens, then hundreds of pages of 
sketches, highly stylized, broadly imaginative, bursting with color. Some are 
whimsical, some menacing. 
</P>
<P>
"They spend their days racking (stealing) paint, sketching pieces. There are 
graffiti conventions, underground newspapers," he said. Dunn remembers how, 
fresh out of Culver City High School in 1980, he worked ideas for his book of 
drawings in cars, at work, at friends' homes, anywhere he had an instant. Then 
came nights spent searching for concrete canvases. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, who has enrolled in several art courses but never completed one, says he 
was drawn by "the finished product," the artistic impact of the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy and Impact 
</P>
<P>
"You break letters into bits, you change the whole style of a letter, you whack 
it out, you really exaggerate its curves or harden its corners, you slice it 
up, add thickness, put arrows through it or give it motion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You make it bust," he concluded. "Bust," it becomes clear, is a central 
concept of graffiti art; it refers to the energy of the completed work, and the 
impact it has on a viewer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an energy to that (spray) can," he insisted, hands shaking with 
intensity and eyes staring at a remote point, "It's carried out to that paint. 
It's part of that experience." 
</P>
<P>
It is an experience, he says, that is hard to let go. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hooked," he confessed. And even now, Dunn says, he has an occasional 
relapse; just two months he was out on a midnight burn, which was interrupted 
by the arrival of police. 
</P>
<P>
But in his bedroom there is evidence that Dunn has moved to different concerns. 
On the wall is a spray-painted 4-by-6-foot self-portrait on canvas. "I haven't 
decided if I'm going to sell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has fewer reservations about parting with other, less personal works. In his 
first venture into commercial art, he sold a work for a case of beer. This 
year, he launched a personal venture called Coolart -- involving the home 
delivery of graffiti. For somewhere between $25 and several hundred dollars, 
depending on the size and complexity of the job, he will paint a wall, a room, 
a storefront or the side of a garage. Together with his work for advertisers, 
Dunn says his painting has netted him between $6,000 and $7,000 so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
His television and print credits include backdrops for music videos and 
advertisements for H. J. Heinz Co.'s Steak-Umm microwaveable snack and TDK 
Electronics Corp. (the latter netted him $2,000). A work on an 8-by-10-foot 
piece of denim brought $700, although Dunn learned that the item later sold for 
$10,000 to a group of clothing designers interested in the look, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But most young graffiti crew members paint only out of competition, ego, and 
fascination. "They don't care" about money or what society thinks, Dunn says. 
"They want the exposure, they want to be up, they want the approval of their 
fellow artists." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broken Homes 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, though no social scientist, believes urban graffiti are a symptom of 
broader social problems: 
</P>
<P>
"Society has inherent problems. Families are broken up, everybody comes from a 
broken home, right? Kids don't have their needs met; then, on the street, they 
find some way of getting their needs met, if it's punk or dance or art." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn's father left the family when he was 2 months old. 
</P>
<P>
"All the best painters I know and the people into the underground scene come 
from an alcoholic family or an abusive family or a broken home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a conscientious painter," he added, insisting that he works only in 
"places that are OK to paint." For Dunn, these include public areas, run-down 
buildings, freeway retaining walls, auto or train yards, alleys -- anywhere, in 
short, where he determines that "there's a cement wall there and (paint) 
doesn't do any harm." 
</P>
<P>
He offhandedly condemns what he sees as ugly graffiti: black, one-line scrawls 
typically written by gang members in roll-call fashion, or bland pieces put up 
by graffiti painters who are simply after exposure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Wrong Way 
</P>
<P>
But moments later, he insists that there is no need to be judgmental. "It does 
violate (a code) for me to tell what another artist should be doing," he said. 
"I could never say what another artist does is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Clean-up efforts, which do not attack the underlying social issues, will keep 
failing because they don't meet the painters at their level, Dunn says. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is no way to do it," Dunn contended, dismissing the latest effort 
by Los Angeles against graffiti: legislation that would pay property owners to 
clean off paint or face heavy penalties. "The only way to get control of it is, 
if the leaders of the crews stop tagging up nice buildings in nice 
neighborhoods. And that'll never happen." 
</P>
<P>
Reduced to their basics, Dunn says, graffiti are just communications from a 
group of youths who feel they have no other voice. 
</P>
<P>
"There was such a rush the first time I went out and did it," he said, "It's 
not gang activity. . . . It's not bad street stuff. Everyone's just trying to 
bust better." 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's a part of me, it's my vision, my heart," Dunn said. "It's my 
best, busting out to you to see what you can do."

AERIAL ARTIST DOES HIS PAINTING AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Miller splashes reds and blues and golds and silvers against the Long Beach 
night sky. He views himself as an artist who paints a panorama of bright 
flashes accompanied by loud booms. 
</P>
<P>
Miller launches the fireworks that appear Friday and Saturday nights over the 
fantail of the Queen Mary. Officially, he is a pyrotechnist. The license plate 
on his Honda Civic reads PYRO. But the Ontario man speaks of fireworks as if he 
were a floral designer -- a dash of blue here, a hint of sparkle there. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the "red-tip comets," one of the 90 types of effects used in the Queen 
Mary show. "They'll start out as a nice beautiful gold . . . and at the end of 
the tentacles it will burn to a bright red." 
</P>
<P>
Or a "tiger tail." He explains: "When it comes out of the gun you will see this 
column of gold that arcs into the sky." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'1812 Overture' Was the Best 
</P>
<P>
When he thinks of the best fireworks displays, he remembers shows like the one 
he gave to accompany a performance of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" by the 
Dallas Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
During one passage, he said, he fired a volley of shells that appeared in the 
sky as a field of gold. Then he started shooting "green mare's tails" to give 
the effect of sprouting plant stems. Next, still in time to the music, came 
large "chrysanthemums" -- flower-like bursting shells that filled the sky with 
changing colors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were sitting back, you would see a field with flowers growing in it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mary show is not quite as elaborate, but it still presents a 
challenge. Miller, 36, and his team arrive in Long Beach in the late afternoon 
to set each of 235 onion-shaped skyrocket shells into mortars on the rock dike 
astern of the old liner. They attach electrical wires to light the fuses. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m., the taped music starts to play. Miller or a fellow crewman from San 
Diego Fireworks, which has the Queen Mary contract for the summer shows, stands 
at a control panel about 100 yards from the mortars. 
</P>
<P>
Miller listens as prerecorded cues are called out through a pair of headphones. 
Each time a number is called, he rubs an electric pencil against a 
corresponding number on the control panel, which causes an electrical charge 
that instantly fires the skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to get the skyrockets to explode in time with the music, a feat 
that requires years of practice because of the delay from the time of launch 
until the shell detonates. Atmospheric conditions complicate the procedure, 
affecting the time it takes for the skyrockets to explode. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moisture Affects Speed 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the shells and can see if they are going off slow or fast in time with 
the music," he said. "I will either shoot a half-second early or half-second 
late in order to keep (up). The black powder in the lifting charge absorbs 
moisture out of the air. The more moisture, the slower (the fuse) burns. 
</P>
<P>
When the timing is right, the thud of the exploding shells echoes across the 
Queen Mary's decks with the beat of such tunes as, "Britannia Rules the Waves." 
</P>
<P>
"When it's right on, it's incredible," said Rick Buche, manager of 
entertainment at the Queen Mary who regularly attends the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is the first to admit, however, that he tinkers with an imperfect 
science. Sometimes shells explode prematurely, too late or not at all. As 
required by his state license, he must shut down the show if winds are blowing 
too strongly or in a direction that could make the skyrockets a hazard aboard 
the ship. And pleasure boats sometimes slip into the restricted area directly 
beneath the bursting fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
If the show is temporarily interrupted, Miller said, he tries to fire the 
remaining skyrockets whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have creative control and as I know all the shells and (their) location, I 
will insert them in the show where they best fit the music and theme of the 
music," Miller said. "If they don't fit, I just dump them into the finale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varied Explosives 
</P>
<P>
The finale is an assortment of just about everything that can explode, from a 
"salute," an aerial bomb that erupts into a bright flash with a halo around it, 
to a "peony," another type of flower-like shell that features a smaller, more 
intense burst than a chrysanthemum. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has become such a fixture in his five summers at the Queen Mary that he 
is pointed out during his interview by a guide on a passing boat loaded with 
tourists. They wave at the man in shorts and a beret. Miller waves back. 
</P>
<P>
"I love fireworks," he said as he wired fuses in the bright afternoon sunshine. 
"I can't believe they pay me to play with fireworks. It's like a Walter Mitty 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July is to pyrotechnists what Christmas is to Santa Claus. 
Sometimes Miller will travel from state to state to participate in several 
shows leading up to the national holiday. Besides his Queen Mary duties for San 
Diego Fireworks, Miller travels with the National Fireworks Ensemble, an elite 
corps of five pyrotechnists and their crews who arrange super shows of 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ensemble staged one of the shows in Long Beach Harbor under the 
sponsorship of a local radio station. The skyrockets were launched from two 
barges to coincide with disco dance music broadcast over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a Marine sniper during the Vietnam War, participated in his first 
fireworks show, a bicentennial Fourth of July show in Arcadia in 1976. He 
received his license two years later and will have conducted 502 shows in 10 
states when the Queen Mary season ends with a Labor Day show. 
</P>
<P>
Through his many shows, Miller has established himself as one of a handful of 
fireworks technicians who ply their trade in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky to have the guy," Buche said of Miller. "He is one of the masters 
of the business."

COUNCIL CONSIDERS 'MANSIONIZATION' LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'BDTimes Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to homeowners concerned about the "mansionization" of their 
neighborhoods, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday introduced a temporary 
ordinance that would establish size limits and a stringent review process for 
the construction or major expansion of single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, "mansionization" -- tearing down existing houses and building 
new ones that nearly fill their lots -- has become a trend in several Los 
Angeles County communities, particularly on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades and the city of Los Angeles have adopted 
anti-mansionization measures recently. Critics contend such measures deprive 
individuals of private property rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale ordinance, which council members said they will adopt Tuesday, 
will last from one to two years. During that time, the city's planning staff 
would work on a permanent ordinance that would regulate construction according 
to each neighborhood's characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal introduced Tuesday by the planning staff calls for limits on 
height, landscaping, open space and parking. It would also limit the minimum 
distance between the building's exterior and the adjacent street and property 
lines and establish a floor-area ratio -- a method for controlling building 
size by measuring the relation of floor space to the lot area. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would also require that all new construction of more than 700 
square feet be approved by the city's Design Review Board. Planning Director 
John McKenna told the council that the 700-square-foot limit was proposed 
because it amounts to a "sizable addition to an already existing house." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, more than 100 residents attended the debate on the council's 
proposal. About a dozen addressed the council, with a slight majority favoring 
the ordinance. Representatives of three homeowners associations said they 
supported the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Tamara Campbell made an emotional plea against it. "Once again, the government 
is intruding into our private rights," she said. "This ordinance would make our 
homes subject to the taste of bureaucrats and our neighbors. We live in a free 
society. These things shouldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner said after the meeting: "A few years back, we all felt that 
government at every level should stay out of our lives. But with the increase 
in property values, many people with a whole lot of money are imposing their 
desires on the rest of the city until the government has to step in." 
</P>
<P>
If adopted next week, the ordinance would take effect within 30 days.

VENTURA GROWTH PLAN'S FRUSTRATED OPPONENTS PONDER NEW STRATEGY

A Ventura citizens group opposed to the City Council's growth plan is trying to 
regroup in the wake of the council's final vote this week in favor of a 
population of 115,000 by the year 2010. 
</P>

But the group concedes that it is only beginning to learn the political basics 
needed to overturn city policy in an initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's estimated population now is 90,000. The citizens group, called the 
Alliance for Ventura's Future, would like a slower rate of growth than the one 
the City Council approved. 
</P>
<P>
The group has scheduled a Sept. 13 meeting at Anacapa School to plan its 
strategy in the wake of final City Council approval of the city's comprehensive 
growth plan initially approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Alliance for Ventura's Future originally had hoped to organize a referendum 
on the growth plan to be included on the Nov. 7 ballot, when four City Council 
seats will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Plans Frustrated 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Bean, vice chairwoman of Alliance as well as a council candidate, said 
this week, however, that the group's plans were frustrated by the timing of the 
council's final actions. 
</P>
<P>
She said the council's decision to postpone until Monday a final vote on the 
comprehensive plan made it impossible for the citizen's group to get a 
referendum on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternative would have been to force a special election sometime 
around Christmas, Bean said. Alliance members decided that that would have been 
politically divisive. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out with the idea of a referendum, but they kept postponing the 
final date for the council vote," Bean said. "This makes it much harder for us. 
An initiative campaign is much harder to organize than a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Involves More Expense 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be legally airtight, and that involves added legal expenses," she 
added. "We will be discussing the costs and general strategy Sept. 13 with some 
experts from Santa Barbara who ran a similar initiative campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Councilman Richard Francis was among several council members 
questioning whether an initiative campaign on the growth issue will be 
successful in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to underestimate the public, but my personal opinion is that 
there must be some difficulty in the organization or they wouldn't have 
switched from the referendum approach to this one," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
The group's present goal, Bean said, is to have the initiative written this 
fall and placed on the general election ballot next June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Although Alliance members privately say their goal is to limit Ventura's 
population to 102,000 by the year 2010, Bean declined to discuss a figure and 
said any initiative proposal specifying a population limit would be rejected by 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"The language has to be couched in certain legalese," she said. "This is not 
going to be simple to write. The goal is to stop the rapid growth in Ventura. 
It will be hard, but I wouldn't be involved if I didn't think it has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara, a citizens group collected 10,500 signatures for an 
initiative campaign aimed at limiting future commercial growth. The Santa 
Barbara group has delayed filing its petitions, however, because of a 
city-sponsored ballot question on the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Clerk Barbara Kam said the timing of the city's final approval of 
the growth plan was not related to the effort of the citizens group in any way, 
but was simply the result of the lengthy time required in printing copies of 
the planning documents. 
</P>
<P>
Kam said that any referendum effort launched later than early July would not 
have qualified for the November ballot. She said an initiative drive aimed at 
next June's ballot will require the signatures of 15% of the 52,000 or so 
registered voters in the city.

'I FIND (OLDER WOMEN'S) EXPERIENCE ATTRACTIVE. I LIKE GOING OUT WITH A WOMAN 
WHO ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS.'; 
</P>
<P>
AT THIS CLUB, THERE ARE NO ODD COUPLES 
</P>

Charles Roberts' parents never said anything, but he could tell they 
disapproved by the looks on their faces. Roberts, a 35-year-old chemical 
engineer who lives in Eagle Rock, likes older women -- 20 or 30 years older. 
From time to time he's gone out with women closer to his own age, but, he said, 
"I just don't seem to get excited about the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was one of half a dozen men in their 20s and 30s at a recent 
brunch-time meeting of the DecMay Club at a Wilshire Boulevard hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The group, made up of nonsmokers interested in meeting older women or younger 
men, is neither shocked at the youthfulness of some of Cher's beaus nor 
horrified at the recent marriage of fashion designer Mary McFadden, 53, to 
Kohle Yohannon, 22. Nobody snickers at the notion of a man's choosing to be 
with a woman old enough to be his mother or even his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safe, Comfortable Place 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984 by Phyllis Sidney, the club has a core of about 30 active 
members, said Sidney, a designer of fashion accessories. At the brunch, the 
ratio of men to women was about 3 to 1. But that was a fluke, said Sidney. 
Usually the number of men and women is about equal. Judie Gold, who described 
herself as "57 going on 25" and was at her first club meeting, said she thought 
the mix was perfect. "This is a lovely turnout," said Gold, who is assistant to 
the head of TV at Motown Productions. "Ask any woman." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney, who is 60 and lives in West Hollywood, said she started the group 
because there was no safe, comfortable place for women such as herself to meet 
the younger men they prefer. Sidney, who used to joke to friends that their 
sons were too old for her, said she finds she likes men "up to about 40." 
</P>
<P>
Bars weren't the answer for Sidney. And at most singles events, she found, the 
expectation was that women, at least, would show interest only in men their own 
age or older. 
</P>
<P>
"I would approach a man I found attractive and that I thought was appropriate, 
and he would look at me with complete bewilderment," she recalled. Sidney ran 
an ad proposing the unusual social club in a local alternative newspaper. 
"Eleven people showed up at the first meeting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Dating Going On' 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Sidney recalled, an organization that facilitates December-May 
liaisons for women "was considered beyond avant-garde -- it was considered 
sick." One of the best things about the group, members say, is that they don't 
have to deny, explain or justify preferences that some people regard as odd, 
comic or even distasteful. "Everybody who comes here knows why they're here," 
Sidney said. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which runs ads in singles publications, meets as often as five times 
a month for brunch, picnics and parties at members' homes. Dues are $20 for six 
months. So far, the organization hasn't resulted in a wedding, but, Sidney 
said, "there's been a lot of dating going on." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, which is open to people of any age, say they don't buy 
the conventional view that women become less desirable as they age. "I find 
their experience attractive," said Robert James of Long Beach. "I like going 
out with a woman who already knows what she wants," said James, 23, who looks 
even younger. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she was married to an older man for 16 "yucky" years. She turned to 
younger men because "men my own age would try to sabotage me. I've never found 
a young man who would do that." 
</P>
<P>
Her male contemporaries, she said, tend to be domineering and patronizing or 
worse toward women. "Older men presume a lot," she said. "I don't need someone 
to tell me to cross the street. If I need a man, I need a man. All my 
experiences with younger men have been delightful. Younger men don't feel that 
they have to be in charge of the world, in charge of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, she said, "with younger men, I could be who I really am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finds Younger Men Fun 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she finds it easier to find like-minded companions among young men, 
but she wouldn't say no to the right silver-haired man. "I would go out with a 
man my own age if he was playful, if he was helpful," she said. She also said 
she finds that younger men are more fun. Her profession -- designing bows and 
other decorations for women's hair -- is demanding, creative work, she said, 
"and I need to keep my spirits up." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the men at the brunch chose not to be interviewed. Others said they 
felt comfortable with older women in ways they did not feel with women their 
own age. James said he doesn't think he is particularly attractive to female 
contemporaries because they place so much emphasis on "appearance and status." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a very glamorous life style," said James, who works in retail and 
goes to college part-time. "What I have to offer women are not things that can 
be bought." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight-year-old Mike Holland of Glendale, who has dated a woman 20 years 
his senior, said he likes the independence so many older woman show -- "they 
take control of their own agenda." Holland, who runs his own equipment rental 
business, said he thinks "there's more pretense involved in relationships with 
younger women." 
</P>
<P>
As did several other club members, Holland said he would not be put off by an 
older woman's inability to have children, since he doesn't particularly want to 
have children of his own. Holland has not discussed his interest in older women 
with his family, he said, "but my friends respect my choice." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she has only once had to ask someone who came to a meeting not to 
come back. He was a problem drinker, she said. As to the possibility that some 
young hustler will join the club in hopes of meeting and exploiting a wealthy 
older woman, Sidney doesn't worry about it. "These are all older women, and 
they can take care of themselves."

ORIENTATION FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campus tour for parents will coincide with the start of a mentor program 
during a three-day orientation for Latino students at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
The mentor system, which will match 50 students to campus and community 
members, is meant to boost the students' self-esteem, said John Gonzalez, 
director of the college's Hispanic Student Center, sponsor of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The mentors include professors, doctors, architects and public relations 
professionals, "nurturing people willing to go the extra mile (who) realize the 
students haven't had many positive role models in their lives," Gonzalez said. 
They will give advice on careers and school as well as invite students to their 
workplaces, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which will run from Tuesday through Thursday, will include 
workshops on self-image, overcoming negative stereotypes, note-taking and time 
management. It is part of a drive started in February to increase the number of 
Latino students and help them succeed. Latinos make up more than 30% of the Los 
Angeles County population but only about 12% of the college's 18,000 students, 
college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour for parents will take place from 5 to 6 p.m. Wednesday, starting at 
the Santa Monica College Concert Hall.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: THE FORMATION OF A COMMITTEE FOR SUCH A TASK MAY NOT 
USUALLY BE AN EVENT OF HIGH DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a small, crowded room Saturday, the Friends of the Echo Park Library 
appointed a committee to find the right spot for a branch library. 
</P>
<P>
Its mission is to lift the branch out of the cramped, poorly located and 
ill-designed temporary home that it was dropped into 15 years ago when its 
original building was damaged in the 1971 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Formation of a committee for such a task may not usually be an event of high 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
But this one took some doing, as it was clear to all in the room that the 
committee would be heading through some flak. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Friends already know where they want the new branch to be 
and library officials have already ruled their choice a poor one. 
</P>
<P>
The site in question is old Fire Station 6, put into semi-retirement a couple 
of years ago by the Fire Department when a new station was built on Virgil 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The fire station has great appeal to the community because, aside from Echo 
Park Lake itself, it is one of the few public amenities that has some grace and 
is thought of as binding, rather than dividing, the community. 
</P>
<P>
The 1920s structure stands prominently on a lazy curve of Edgeware Road near 
major bus routes and on one of the few streets that crosses the freeway. There 
is still vivid resentment among Echo Park's old-timers over bisection of the 
community by the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Against those largely intangible qualities, the downtown library staff sees 
several fatal deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
They think that the fire station is too small, too old and in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
There are counter-arguments ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends say the building could be expanded from the rear onto three empty 
lots and still cost less than a new building. The librarians contend that the 
lots belong to a church that wants to build on them. The Friends say the church 
could be persuaded to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The librarians say the new branch should be on a business street so it will get 
more use. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends say it will get more use if it has free parking nearby. 
</P>
<P>
And so on. 
</P>
<P>
And that brings up the committee. The Friends invited the community to join in 
the search. Sixteen people showed up Saturday, counting two library officials 
and four of the Friends. 
</P>
<P>
Adding spark to the moment, library officials had hinted that if the debate 
becomes protracted, the $5 million allotted to the branch replacement from a 
recent bond issue could be lost or diminished. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was interpreted as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you get the feeling there is never going to be a library?" asked Sue 
Nelson, a former Westsider who helped prod Washington into creating a national 
park in the Santa Monica Mountains before moving to the old suburb north of 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through this," Nelson said. "Anything that bides time in order to 
let anybody who makes the final decision make it. It makes it look as if the 
community is participating, when it is actually just running around." 
</P>
<P>
Regional Librarian Sonja Williams tried to ease her apprehension with a simile. 
She suggested that they think of the money as being in a pot. 
</P>
<P>
"Down the line, some of these things occur now, some later," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are seven, 10 years down the line. You may wind up using that pot at a 
greater rate. It may cost more to complete the project than what it was 
originally set to cost." 
</P>
<P>
Her simplification was not appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
"So what if your strategy is to destroy this site and not use it?" Nelson 
snapped. "What if you calculate that?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's paranoid," said Sylvia Galan, the Echo Park librarian, who up 
to that moment had tried to take no side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman moved from Nelson's Machiavellian insight to a simple 
proposition: 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't the library say, 'OK, you want it here? Here's the money, you build 
your library?' " asked longtime resident Sophia Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about building a 12,500-square-foot new building as opposed to 
going to an old building that has 4,000 square feet," Williams said with 
growing frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"But what if we can't find the land?" Lewis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even tried," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes we have," several voices said at once. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stall," Nelson concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think we should look a little," Lewis at last conceded. "Look some, 
and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
"Two months," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Mayerson, president of the Friends, asked a soft-spoken man named Craig 
Weingarten, who seemed familiar with the community's bus lines, to head the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted but offered his own doubt that the job could be done under a ground 
rule prohibiting the use of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
That thought unleashed a new outpouring of Angst about developers, who are 
perceived as snapping up all the land in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
Later, one of the Friends summed up the day: 
</P>
<P>
"They thought the Friends group was difficult to deal with," Karen Jaeger said. 
"Now they've seen Echo Park in the raw."

<P>
POLICE STEP UP ENFORCEMENT TO CURTAIL STREET CRUISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pico Rivera officials and police are trying to put an end to cruising, in which 
scores of juveniles and adults take to the streets at night to show off their 
cars and socialize. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, police have been stepping up efforts to curb the 
crusing along Whittier Boulevard and other main streets on Wednesday, Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic that enforcement efforts are working," said Sgt. Rick Adams 
of the county Sheriff's Department. "We've noticed that the traffic is more 
controlable." 
</P>
<P>
From Aug. 23 through 27, police cited 313 cruisers along the main streets, 
Adams said. Usually, police issue an average of 550 citations for moving and 
parking violations and tow away about 14 cars and motorcycles over a two-week 
period, Sheriff's Capt. Tom Sams said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Pico Rivera City Council authorized the use of city funds, about 
$9,000 a week, to pay Sheriff's Department and city employees to put up 
barricades to divert traffic. 
</P>
<P>
About four years ago, city officials vowed to stop the crusing and on a couple 
of occasions were successful by stepping up enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Manager Dennis Courtemarche, crusing in the area "comes and 
goes," but is "much more concentrated and larger" now. 
</P>
<P>
The cruisers are not necessarily residents, Sams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Flyers distributed in the South Bay at the first of June were advertising for 
people to come to Pico Rivera" to cruise, Sams said. Other cruisers have come 
from as far as Moreno Valley. "We've even issued a citation to someone from San 
Jose," he said.

CHURCH LOT SOLD TO BUILDER FOR SENIOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin late in the fall on a 100-unit 
senior citizen apartment complex on a 2.2-acre site owned by the Hawaiian 
Gardens Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan Development Co. of Costa Mesa answered the agency's request last year 
for a senior housing plan for the site on the south side of 226th Street, west 
of Norwalk Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The agency acquired the land for $785,000 from El Dorado Park Community Church, 
which used it as a parking lot, project manager Theresa Dobbs said. Whelan is 
buying the site from the agency for $950,000, Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Under church ownership, Dobbs said, the land generated little tax revenue for 
the city. The new development is expected to generate $50,000 a year in 
property taxes, according to an agency report. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 51 one-bedroom and 49 two-bedroom units, owned and operated by 
Whelan. It will take about a year to build the apartments, Dobbs said.

PROFESSOR ON STATE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Sue Grosz, an English professor at Santa Monica College, has been named 
to the California Community Colleges Board of Governors by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, who has been on the college faculty since 1971, will take her seat on 
the 15-member board at its Sept. 14-15 meeting in Sacramento. The board sets 
policy and provides guidance for 71 community college districts with 107 
campuses throughout the state. Grosz's term expires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely thrilled with the appointment, and I'm looking forward to being 
able to participate in policy-making at the state level," Grosz said. 
</P>
<P>
She said her special concerns include improving the academic quality of the 
community colleges, improving transfer agreements with the University of 
California and California State University, and implementing community college 
reforms legislated last year in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, who lives in West Los Angeles, recently served as president of the 
Academic Senate for California Community Colleges. She is also on the governing 
board of the Faculty Assn. of the California Community Colleges.

SECURITY AT PARK LABREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction crews have erected three guardhouses and set up gates and fences 
for a new security system at Park Labrea, the vast apartment complex east of 
Fairfax Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the equipment has been installed and many residents have been 
issued decals for their automobiles, operation of the security system is not 
expected to begin until November or December, a spokesman for Park Labrea 
management said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million-plus program will close off most of the streets in the 
4,212-unit complex to all but residents and their guests. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be able to enter by any of 11 automatic gates, and security 
guards will clear guests at the three checkpoints.

RACE SPONSORS CLEAR HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Chamber of Commerce's plans for giving an extra kick to the 
city's Western Hemisphere Marathon through corporate sponsorship won 
preliminary approval Monday from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council indicated a willingness to make an exception to its policy and 
allow a major sponsor to advertise the race and itself on street banners and 
signs. It asked the chamber to come back with a proposal outlining the number, 
size and placement of the signs. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed city staff to prepare an agreement giving the chamber 
administrative responsibility for the marathon in exchange for 15% of gross 
receipts from the race. Profits would go toward youth and community activities 
in Culver City and the surrounding area.

Teacher union leaders said that talks with the Compton Unified School District 
have failed to break an impasse, with two weeks remaining until the start of 
the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley Jones, executive director of the teachers' Compton Education Assn., said 
union leaders met for an hour Tuesday with district administrators, yet remain 
"light years apart" on key issues. He said there is a 6% gap between the 
district's salary increase offer and the amount demanded by the teachers.

WATER RATE PLAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors has rejected a plan by the city's Water 
Division staff to restructure city water rates after residents complained that 
the plan would increase costs for homeowners with extensive landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The board has instructed the Water Division staff to return with a revised plan 
on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan would have generated $839,000 needed for additional operating 
expenses by discouraging high-volume water use and rewarding conservation. 
Low-volume water users would have had lower bills under the plan, while 
high-volume users would have seen their rates rise as much as 40%. 
</P>
<P>
But after a contingent of homeowners from Chapman Woods protested at Tuesday's 
meeting that the proposed increase discriminated against homeowners, the board 
directed the staff to modify the plan and add a 3.15% rate increase for all 
water users.

AND THE BELLS CAME DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a year of fund-raising, reconstruction of San Gabriel Mission's 
bell tower has begun. Early this week, Mission Drive in front of the mission 
was closed to traffic, and as a small crowd watched, the mission's six bells -- 
each more than 1,500 pounds -- were taken down by crane. The lands of the San 
Gabriel mission once extended as far as San Bernardino, to San Pedro and beyond 
the Los Angeles River. Founded in 1771, it is the fourth-oldest of California's 
21 missions. It has been closed since suffering damage in the 1987 Whittier 
Narrows earthquake. Once the bell tower is braced, a report on what further 
repairs are needed will be prepared.

BOARD OKS $8-MILLION BOND ISSUE FOR PLANT DIVISION MOVE TO OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week endorsed the issuance of $8 
million in low-interest industrial bonds for a Santa Barbara electronics firm 
to relocate a division and expand in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Scientific Co., an aerospace firm that makes parts for commercial and 
military buyers, said it intends to boost its 208-person work force at Electro 
Kinetics division to about 358 at its proposed Oxnard facility within two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The 120,000-square-foot plant is to be built at MacInnes Ranch Business Park. 
The company operates a 55,000-square-foot plant in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Scientific was attracted by Oxnard's cheaper commercial rents, wider 
labor pool and a housing market that, while high, is more affordable than Santa 
Barbara's, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes very good business sense to relocate," said Robert Lynch, the firm's 
marketing director. Home purchases for new hires in Santa Barbara are 
"practically impossible," he said. "It's very difficult to bring outside people 
in when they have to pay $325,000 for a house." 
</P>
<P>
The relocation is supported by Oxnard, said Michael K. Haviland, the city's 
economic development director. 
</P>
<P>
While some Pacific Scientific employees are expected to relocate from Santa 
Barbara to Ventura County, the firm says it will hire additional semiskilled 
workers for its assembly lines as well as middle managers and supervisors. The 
Oxnard plant is expected to open late next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County assumes no direct liability for ensuring the bonds, although 
state and federal laws require that the county grant its approval before they 
are issued, said Marty Shaw-Halloway of the county administrator's office. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds are underwritten by the California Counties Industrial Development 
Authority. They are also supported by the California Manufacturers Assn. and 
the California County Supervisors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Scientific is the third firm to take advantage of industrial 
development revenue bonds in Ventura County recently. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the county approved $6.1 million in bonds for Image 
Laboratories to construct a manufacturing plant in Oxnard. In May, it approved 
$9 million in bonds for Aquaria to build a plant in Moorpark.

UNION OIL TO CLOSE AN OFFICE, MOVE STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union Oil of California plans to close one of its two Ventura offices and move 
at least 50 employees to Bakersfield as part of a wide-ranging reorganization 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
After the reorganization, which could be completed as soon as January, the 
number of local Unocal employees will drop to 80 or 85 from about 135, said 
company spokesman Art Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons cited for the move is Ventura's high housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to get people who were willing to move from other parts of 
the country like Texas and Oklahoma because of the high cost of living in 
Ventura," Bently said. "Housing costs are appreciably lower in Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Union Oil was founded in Santa Paula nearly 100 years ago by an oil prospector 
and two partners. 
</P>
<P>
Under a company reorganization announced in May, Bakersfield, where the company 
had maintained a small office, will replace Pasadena as the company's 
California headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of oil being produced in the San Joaquin Valley, and 
there are plenty of support facilities such as drilling contractors and well 
maintenance," Bentley said. "Quite simply, the center of the oil business in 
California is Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
The plans have received a cool reception from some Ventura employees. Four have 
quit, and four have retired rather than make the move, Bentley said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who resigned did not qualify for severance pay, which according to 
company policy goes only to employees whose jobs are being terminated, Bentley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're offered a job elsewhere, then we view it as his or her job isn't 
being terminated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop one employee who quit last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you be thrilled to move from Ventura to Bakersfield?," asked the 
employee, who asked not to be identified. "It's hot, it's smoggy, and it's 
dingy."

CITY'S LARGEST RETAIL, OFFICE PROJECT GETS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved final design plans for a 
20-story office and retail development on a key downtown block that has stood 
vacant for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote allows the Homart Development Co. of Chicago to begin construction 
in January on the city's largest project, to be built at Brand Boulevard and 
Broadway, north of the Glendale Galleria shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown merchants have long complained that the site is an eyesore and a 
detriment to retail sales in the area. Old-fashioned stores, including the 
historic Egyptian Village Cafe, were demolished years ago to make way for a 
previously proposed project that never materialized. Most of the block has 
since been surrounded by a deteriorating mauve construction wall. 
</P>
<P>
The development on the west side of Brand will feature a large open plaza with 
a water fountain, shaded seating areas and sidewalk cafes. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-story building, which will have retail stores and restaurants on the 
first two floors below an office tower, will be built at the southern end of 
the block. A temporary park will be constructed on the northern end of the 
block, where the developer eventually plans to build a second 22-story tower. 
</P>
<P>
A multilevel parking garage with space for 1,537 cars will be built along 
Orange Street, with retail stores on the ground level facing the street. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg on Tuesday again voted against 
the project, charging that the 790,000-square-foot development is 90,000 square 
feet larger than the city had deemed suitable for the site and that it would 
worsen downtown traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has agreed to install additional traffic lanes, update traffic 
signals and provide other measures to speed traffic flow on streets around the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The development is designed to draw shoppers from malls into the downtown 
retail zone, which will include a two-block shopping area on the east side of 
Brand called The Exchange, where 1920s-era buildings are being renovated or 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Homart had proposed to begin construction in October. However, city officials 
delayed the start until after the holiday shopping season at the Glendale 
Galleria, where traffic is congested. The first phase of the $41-million 
project is to be completed within two years.

RETARDED TO TRY HANDS AT 'POWER GARDENING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The barren land stretches for miles, with no greenery to soften the glare of 
sunlight off silvery electrical towers, prolific brown weeds and broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
But this fall a group of mentally retarded people, some with physical handicaps 
as well, will plant a garden on more than an acre of the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power's 2 1/2 miles of vacant right-of-way property in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The specially designed garden, to be planted on Whitnall Highway under DWP 
power lines, is intended to spruce up the community and provide therapy for the 
32 mentally retarded clients of VISTAS, a nonprofit program for mentally 
handicapped people with emotional problems, said Kathleen Lynch, executive 
director of the Panorama City-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
The group will invite non-handicapped residents of the area to cultivate plots 
on the property in January, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The garden project was hailed by city officials and community activists as an 
ideal way to get the blight-ridden neighborhoods near Whitnall Highway to 
blossom. And DWP officials said the project will offer insights into what to do 
with the largely vacant, trash-strewn land under their power lines in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried this kind of thing with other organizations and found that after a 
few months, people walk away from it," said Lee Moussafir, DWP's chief real 
estate officer. "But these folks seem like they're really trying to accomplish 
a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Moussafir said the department rents much of the 1,500 miles of rights of way it 
owns in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to nurseries and other 
businesses for about $1,200 a year per acre. But he said the agency has had 
difficulty leasing vacant rights of way in North Hollywood because growers and 
other tenants apparently fear that their plants and goods will be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP would rather rent the land than keep it vacant because of soaring 
maintenance costs, Moussafir said. "It's hard to keep up with the demand," he 
said. "We get a call from one location to remove a sofa, and the next week, we 
get another call about some other trash at the same site." 
</P>
<P>
Under its arrangement with VISTAS, the department will issue a license to the 
University of California's extension service to run the garden for two years on 
a trial basis, Moussafir said. The university's federally funded Common Ground 
Urban Gardens program, which teaches low-income groups, the elderly and youths 
to grow their own food, will maintain the property and train VISTAS staff 
members and clientele in gardening skills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project will cost about $54,000, in part because of special features such 
as 2-foot-high raised beds to make it easier for those with cerebral palsy to 
dig in the dirt, said Sherl Hopkins, demonstration projects coordinator for 
Common Ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaiser-Permanente Community Service Program has donated $5,000 to VISTAS 
for the program, and the rest is being funded by the state and federal 
governments, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
Two VISTAS staff members have already received 11 weeks of training from Common 
Ground. Since June, they have been running a small version of the North 
Hollywood garden project at the Sepulveda Garden Center, a community garden run 
by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks at Hayvenhurst Avenue and 
Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's making a tremendous difference already," Lynch said. "One of our autistic 
clients had been afraid to do anything and would never get his hands dirty. But 
ever since he's been working in the garden, seeing he can make tomato plants 
grow, he's become so much more open and talkative." 
</P>
<P>
Moussafir said the department will consider allowing other community activists 
to use the vacant rights of way. Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood 
Residents Assn., said the vacant property represents "an incredible 
opportunity" to transform power line routes in North Hollywood from barren 
urban scars into parkland.

PASADENA, UCLA TANGLE OVER ALCOHOL AT ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Pasadena Rose Bowl, fall means football and football means tailgate 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the past two weeks, began Act II of the set-to between Rose Bowl and 
UCLA officials. Subtitle: A tempest in a beer cup. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, all's well that ends well. 
</P>
<P>
At stake was the alcohol traditionally sold at two major UCLA tailgating 
parties at Brookside Park, the six-acre park owned by the city of Pasadena in 
front of the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, when the Bruins began playing their home games at the Pasadena 
stadium, about 1,000 members of the UCLA Cheer alumni association have met in 
the park for pre-game parties. In addition, a big tent goes up in the park 
before each game for the chancellor's party, a fete at which university bigwigs 
rub elbows with major contributors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invitations Sent 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after invitations for the Sept. 9 chancellor's party had been 
mailed, UCLA was informed that the city of Pasadena intended to enforce a 
longtime ordinance against drinking in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really old ordinance," said Greg Asbury, who took over as Rose Bowl 
manager in May. "Apparently, over the years, people tailgated and drank in the 
park, even though signs against it are posted throughout the area." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena officials say they didn't intend to enforce the drinking ban for 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1988 season, Cheer members sold their own beer, in between tossing 
around a football and barbecuing steaks, said Steve Salm, UCLA athletic 
business manager. That ended last fall, when the city required Cheer to use 
Service America Corp., the stadium's concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
But UCLA Cheer members decided after the season that they didn't like using the 
concessionaire, and so in February asked if they could go back to selling their 
own beer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Exemptions 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Asbury and other city officials decided to prohibit alcohol sales in 
the park but allow exemptions for organizations that meet certain requirements, 
including liability insurance and a state liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
Neither UCLA Cheer nor the chancellor's party met the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy floored UCLA, which got the word Aug. 14, less than four weeks 
before the first home game, Salm said. "We were looking at a narrowly defined 
question, 'Can UCLA Cheer serve beer?' and we were told, not only can't you do 
that" but a slew of new regulations were added. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the two sides had reached a compromise: UCLA Cheer won't sell beer. 
The chancellor's party will get an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is things are not significantly different than the way they 
were in the past," Salm said. "I guess it's like Shakespeare wrote, 'Much Ado 
About Nothing.' "

The heavy hand of City Hall once again proposes to harass the citizens of the 
city. The citizens don't desire or need to be chased from their street parking 
spaces at night. But City Hall, in its infinite wisdom, wants to inflict this 
dastardly harassment and to collect a fee so as to increase the city 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
If there were an off-street space available, a resident would gladly use it to 
get away from the graffiti, vandalism and risk of a stolen auto, a problem 
brought on by the City Council with its loose commercial and multifamily 
building policy over the past 10 or more years. Has any graffiti painter been 
arrested? 
</P>
<P>
Not for street sweeping at midnight! Who wants to be awakened at 3 a.m. by a 
roaring sweeping machine? Most cars are off the street in the daytime when 
sweeping is done every two weeks or less often. People do go to work elsewhere. 
Even for this, the citizens are harassed by being required to vacate a street 
once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Residents keep the peace by parking their cars on the street and thus not 
making them available for nighttime revelers to use them while they occupy 
bars, restaurants, et al., until 2 a.m., then litter and wake up the 
neighborhood as they depart. Is this parking policy aimed at supporting the 
bars? 
</P>
<P>
Divide and conquer! Pick on one small area first, then another, then another -- 
each so the rage of citizens will not be too loud and can thus be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing positive is attained. The citizen is harassed, the car owner is 
harassed and assessed, the city squeezes more money out of the citizen, the 
city establishment grows unnecessarily, another attack is made on the citizens' 
freedom.

HARBOR DISTRICT BOARD BRISTLES AT IDEA OF TRIMMING BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Oxnard Harbor District, which governs the Port of Hueneme, bristled this 
week at a suggestion by the mayors of Oxnard and Port Hueneme that the 
district's boundaries be reduced, stripping some county residents of the right 
to elect port commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
District president Ray Fletcher said he does not want city officials in Oxnard 
and Port Hueneme to "mess up a good thing" by attempting to shrink the district 
to the size of those two cities. Such a move, he said, would affect the 
composition of the present five-member board of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have has worked well so far, and we have brought the harbor to 
success," said Fletcher, an Oxnard resident. He said he fears losing a pool of 
qualified port commissioner candidates who live outside Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The district now spans those cities as well as Camarillo and parts of Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi said the port commissioners have jumped the gun with 
their vociferous opposition, which surfaced at a district meeting this week, 
because neither city officially has moved to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"No action of any definitive nature has taken place yet," Takasugi said. "It 
may develop, but at this moment it's just conjectural, 
let's-suppose-this-happened speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said he believes that the harbor district's boundaries are outdated 
because Oxnard and Port Hueneme bear the brunt of the industrial port's 
activity without what he called 'adequate represention" on its board. 
</P>
<P>
At present, only one commissioner, Fletcher, is from Oxnard. Three are from 
Camarillo, one is from Thousand Oaks, and none are from Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real impact of the port on other cities except Port Hueneme and 
Oxnard. So that's why I guess there's been some speculation on our part that 
perhaps a study should be done, or perhaps we should reduce the size of the 
district," he said. Altering the district would require the approval of the 
county's Local Agency Formation Commission.

30 RUN FOR BOARD OF COMPTON SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED DISTRICT FACES GROWING DISCONTENT BY TEACHERS, PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty people have filed to run for election to the board of a Compton Unified 
School District that is facing growing teacher and parent discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Five seats on the seven-member board will be on the November ballot. Four of 
the positions carry four-year terms. The fifth seat, to fill an unexpired term, 
will be for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The district is losing about 128 of its teachers this year. Many are switching 
to the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers won a three-year, 
24% pay raise in the spring after a four-week strike, according to district 
teachers union officials. 
</P>
<P>
Compton parents at board meetings and other gatherings have expressed concern 
over the district's low student scores on state tests. The scores average in 
the first percentile on a scale of 1 to 100. School buildings are crumbling 
and, according to some parents, are unsafe. And the district's swelling Latino 
enrollment, which could exceed 50% this year, is resulting in more pressure 
from Latino residents for better bilingual services and an equal share of the 
district's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the candidates are long-time incumbents seeking new four-year terms. 
They are John Steward, a deputy probation officer for Los Angeles County; 
Kelvin Filer, a Compton attorney; Sam Littleton, a medical social worker at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, and Manuel Correa, a retired city 
police commander who is also the only elected Latino official in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth incumbent is Lynn Dymally, whose father is Rep. Mervyn Dymally 
(D-Compton). She was appointed to the board only last month to replace Bernice 
Woods, who was elected in June to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Some district residents were angry over the appointment, which was made without 
public notice. Critics also see it as an attempt by Dymally's father to grasp 
more political power in the city. The residents launched a petition drive to 
have the congressman's daughter removed but failed to gather the necessary 
number of signatures in time to meet the deadline. Organizers of the drive were 
attempting to force the school board to remove Dymally and leave the seat 
vacant until the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally has already served one term on the board, but in 1987 decided not to 
seek reelection. Known also by her married name of Lynn Dymally Lee, the 
congressman's daughter faces three challengers vying to serve the remaining two 
years of Woods' term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Win Seat Earlier 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Acquanetta Harrison Warren, 33, who tried two years ago to win a 
seat on the board. A product manager for First Interstate Bank, Warren and her 
husband have two children in the Compton schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also running is Kalem Aquil, a 41-year-old electronics technician with the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District who is making his first bid for 
public office. He has three children in the city schools and is a member of the 
district's advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth challenger to Dymally is Omar Bradley, 30, a high school English 
teacher in the Lynwood schools, who ran unsuccessfully for the City Council 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's sister-in-law, Paula L. Howard, is among the 26 candidates running 
for four-year terms. Howard, 36, is a physical education teacher in the Lynwood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also running for four-year terms are Margaret Moore, 58, a community liaison 
with the school district, who almost won a spot on the board when she was a 
candidate two years ago; Madelina D. Dewberry, a former teacher who is now 
manager of human resources at American Express' Culver City office, and 
47-year-old Earnest Spears, executive director of the Compton Chamber of 
Commerce. Spears ran unsuccessfully this year for city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Run for Board 
</P>
<P>
Gorgonio (Greg) Sanchez Jr., a quality control manager for a manufacturing 
company and a member of the city government's Latino Advisory Committee, is 
making his second run for the school board. He was an unsuccessful candidate in 
1985 but this year, he says, the Latino community is organizing a voter 
registration drive. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Sadie R. Benham, a child-care center teacher; Muhammad 
Abdullah, a student at Cal State Long Beach; Verda M. Cheathen, a teacher; Gary 
Leon Daniels, a minister and a teacher; Hyacinth Dandridge, an educator and 
community activist; Deborah M. Gayles, library assistant; Nancy L. Johnson, a 
retired teacher; Roy E. Little, a vocational rehabilitation counselor; and Saul 
E. Lankster, a former school board member who listed his occupation as educator 
and business administrator and operates a florist shop. 
</P>
<P>
Also running are Chester L. Hammond Sr.; youth services counselor; Dhanifu S. 
Karim, student and counselor; Malcum Mumford, a sheet-metal worker; Ken 
Perkins, who is self-employed; Otha Ray Scott, an educator; Mae Thomas, a 
community parent facilitator; Walter E. White Jr., a retired property manager; 
and Patricia Moore, who works for the city as a business license inspector. She 
is not related to the councilwoman of the same name.

PYROTECHNIST LIGHTS UP SKY WITH AERIAL ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Miller splashes reds and blues and golds and silvers against the Long Beach 
night sky. He views himself as an artist who paints a panorama of bright 
flashes accompanied by loud booms. 
</P>
<P>
Miller launches the fireworks that appear Friday and Saturday nights over the 
fantail of the Queen Mary. Officially, he is a pyrotechnist. The license plate 
on his Honda Civic reads PYRO. But the Ontario man speaks of fireworks as if he 
were a floral designer -- a dash of blue here, a hint of sparkle there. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the "red-tip comets," one of the 90 types of effects used in the Queen 
Mary show. "They'll start out as a nice beautiful gold . . . and at the end of 
the tentacles it will burn to a bright red." 
</P>
<P>
Or a "tiger tail." He explains: "When it comes out of the gun you will see this 
column of gold that arcs into the sky." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'1812 Overture' 
</P>
<P>
When he thinks of the best fireworks displays, he remembers shows like the one 
he gave to accompany a performance of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" by the 
Dallas Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
During one passage, he said, he fired a volley of shells that appeared in the 
sky as a field of gold. Then he started shooting "green mare's tails" to give 
the effect of sprouting plant stems. Next, still in time to the music, came 
large "chrysanthemums" -- flower-like bursting shells that filled the sky with 
changing colors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were sitting back, you would see a field with flowers growing in it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mary show is not quite as elaborate, but it still presents a 
challenge. Miller, 36, and his team arrive in Long Beach in the late afternoon 
to set each of 235 onion-shaped skyrocket shells into mortars on the rock dike 
astern of the old liner. They attach electrical wires to light the fuses. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m., the taped music starts to play. Miller or a fellow crewman from San 
Diego Fireworks, which has the Queen Mary contract for the summer shows, stands 
at a control panel about 100 yards from the mortars. 
</P>
<P>
Miller listens as prerecorded cues are called out through a pair of headphones. 
Each time a number is called, he rubs an electric pencil against a 
corresponding number on the control panel, which causes an electrical charge 
that instantly fires the skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to get the skyrockets to explode in time with the music, a feat 
that requires years of practice because of the delay from the time of launch 
until the shell detonates. Atmospheric conditions complicate the procedure, 
affecting the time it takes for the skyrockets to explode. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moisture Affects Speed 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the shells and can see if they are going off slow or fast in time with 
the music," he said. "I will either shoot a half-second early or half-second 
late in order to keep (up). The black powder in the lifting charge absorbs 
moisture out of the air. The more moisture, the slower (the fuse) burns. 
</P>
<P>
When the timing is right, the thud of the exploding shells echoes across the 
Queen Mary's decks with the beat of such tunes as, "Britannia Rules the Waves." 
</P>
<P>
"When it's right on, it's incredible," said Rick Buche, manager of 
entertainment at the Queen Mary who regularly attends the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is the first to admit, however, that he tinkers with an imperfect 
science. Sometimes shells explode prematurely, too late or not at all. As 
required by his state license, he must shut down the show if winds are blowing 
too strongly or in a direction that could make the skyrockets a hazard aboard 
the ship. And pleasure boats sometimes slip into the restricted area directly 
beneath the bursting fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
If the show is temporarily interrupted, Miller said, he tries to fire the 
remaining skyrockets whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have creative control and as I know all the shells and (their) location, I 
will insert them in the show where they best fit the music and theme of the 
music," Miller said. "If they don't fit, I just dump them into the finale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varied Explosives 
</P>
<P>
The finale is an assortment of just about everything that can explode, from a 
"salute," an aerial bomb that erupts into a bright flash with a halo around it, 
to a "peony," another type of flower-like shell that features a smaller, more 
intense burst than a chrysanthemum. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has become such a fixture in his five summers at the Queen Mary that he 
is pointed out during his interview by a guide on a passing boat loaded with 
tourists. They wave at the man in shorts and a beret. Miller waves back. 
</P>
<P>
"I love fireworks," he said as he wired fuses in the bright afternoon sunshine. 
"I can't believe they pay me to play with fireworks. It's like a Walter Mitty 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July is to pyrotechnists what Christmas is to Santa Claus. 
Sometimes Miller will travel from state to state to participate in several 
shows leading up to the national holiday. Besides his Queen Mary duties for San 
Diego Fireworks, Miller travels with the National Fireworks Ensemble, an elite 
corps of five pyrotechnists and their crews who arrange super shows of 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ensemble staged one of the shows in Long Beach Harbor under the 
sponsorship of a local radio station. The skyrockets were launched from two 
barges to coincide with disco dance music broadcast over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a Marine sniper during the Vietnam War, participated in his first 
fireworks show, a bicentennial Fourth of July show in Arcadia in 1976. He 
received his license two years later and will have conducted 502 shows in 10 
states when the Queen Mary season ends with a Labor Day show. 
</P>
<P>
Through his many shows, Miller has established himself as one of a handful of 
fireworks technicians who ply their trade in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky to have the guy," Buche said of Miller. "He is one of the masters 
of the business."

CAL STATE LONG BEACH 49ERS HEAD INTO NEW SEASON WITH AN IMPROVED TEAM, ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two lean seasons, the Cal State Long Beach football team, which begins 
its 1989 schedule against Cal State Northridge at noon Saturday at Veterans 
Stadium, is hoping to regain respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good-looking athletes now," Athletic Director Corey Johnson said 
while watching a recent practice. "Before, we had guys who didn't look good in 
uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
It has taken until now for the 49ers to recover from the crisis of late 1986 
when the university almost dropped football because of money problems. The 
effect that had on recruiting was reflected in the overall records of 4-7 in 
1987 and 3-9 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been rough," said Larry Reisbig, 48, who is starting his third season as 
49er coach. "I knew three years ago it was going to take a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
But fund-raising efforts by the 49er Athletic Foundation have put football back 
on stable financial ground, Johnson said. The foundation has raised about 
$800,000 in the last two years, which has increased football scholarships to 
70, 20 more than in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The team appears to finally have decent depth, and Reisbig said that for the 
first time since he has been coach he is being contacted by players who want to 
transfer to Long Beach. "Everything is positive now," he said. "We're 
competitive, we're going to scare a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the new atmosphere and 11 returning starters, the 49ers have been 
picked by Big West Conferences coaches to finish sixth in the eight-team 
league. They tied for fifth last year with a 3-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
But because the Big West, with the exception of Fresno State, is composed of 
some of the weakest teams in Division I-A, even a little improvement could make 
most of the teams contenders for second place behind Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s the 49ers have had three outstanding quarterbacks -- Todd Dillon, 
Doug Gaynor and Jeff Graham. This season they will have untested senior Paul 
Oates, who as Graham's backup played in just seven games the last three years, 
throwing 29 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Oates, 24, is a left-hander from Granada Hills and a former minor league 
baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Oates is going to make us exciting," Reisbig said. "He has a quick, 
strong arm and is a good leader." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Expects to Have Jitters 
</P>
<P>
Oates, whose passes are sometimes too hard for his receivers to handle, has 
waited patiently for this chance. He is confident but says, "The first few 
games I should have some jitters." 
</P>
<P>
He will work behind an offensive line that could be one of the team's 
strengths. It includes 6-foot-5, 290-pound Dave McKinnon and 6-5, 300-pound 
Cornelius Harrell, both seniors. McKinnon was second-team all-Big West last 
season and Harrell won honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
The top receiver is Derek Washington, who caught 48 passes for 752 yards last 
year. His 105 career receptions rank seventh in 49er history. Another target 
for Oates will be Kelly Ryan, who averaged 12 yards on 23 catches last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Seay, who caught 31 passes for 480 yards last year as a sophomore, may 
not be with the team. Seay, who lost a kidney when he was shot during a 
children's party last Halloween, was declared medically ineligible in July. He 
has sued CSULB in an effort to resume his career, but Sept. 11 is the earliest 
that there could be a decision in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Southerland, the leading rusher last year, is not expected to play 
because of nerve damage in his shoulder. His replacement at tailback will 
likely by Freddie Leslie Jr., a transfer from Los Angeles Southwest Community 
College. Jeff Fassett, a hard runner from San Jacinto Junior College, has been 
impressive in practice. 
</P>
<P>
The fullbacks will be Jim Bittner, who played in eight games last year, and 
Herman Nash, who was Pasadena City College's most valuable player in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Graham, who threw for 2,720 yards, the 49ers averaged only 16.8 
points a game in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And they gave up 32 a game, mainly, said defensive coordinator Ken Visser, 
because of a line that was the weakest at the school in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Visser has changed the defensive alignment from a 3-4 to a 4-3 in hopes of 
getting a better pass rush. To strengthen the line, he moved 6-4, 240-pound 
linebacker Pepper Jenkins, an aggressive pass rusher, to end. Jenkins joins two 
veterans, 6-3, 250-pound Lemuel Hawkins and 6-3, 245-pound Richard Hensley. A 
promising newcomer is Raul Garcia, a transfer from Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a big problem: The status of Dan Duffy, who made 65 tackles 
last year and was second-team all-Big West, is uncertain. He is seeking 
reinstatement after being disqualified academically last spring. 
</P>
<P>
If the defense is to regain the prestige it had several years ago, the linemen 
must come through, Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
At inside linebacker, the 49ers have Mark Ziegenhagen, who had 63 tackles last 
year and Gene Lemmers, who had 28. Outside linebackers will be Pat Workun, a 
redshirt last year, and Greg Hollins, a transfer from San Diego City College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baseball Player Contends for a Spot 
</P>
<P>
The defensive backfield includes veterans Marc Tourville, Keith Washington, 
Stan Davis and Leon Patterson. Contending for Tourville's free safety job is 
Jay Carballo, the shortstop on the 49er baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
The punter will be Fred Morales, a newcomer from DeAnza Junior College in 
Cupertino. Reisbig said that junior Rick Schwendinger will be the place-kicker 
in Saturday's opener. Leo Rowland, a transfer from Diablo Valley Junior 
College, had been recruited for that job but he injured his back. 
</P>
<P>
Reisbig is happy he won't have to play Oregon and UCLA back-to-back this 
season. Last year the 49ers lost to Oregon, 49-0, and to UCLA, 56-3, on 
successive weeks. Long Beach will play at Oregon Oct. 28, but UCLA isn't on the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Only four of the 49ers' 12 games will be played at home, one more than last 
year when the average attendance at Veterans Stadium was only 5,209. 
</P>
<P>
An improved team will not necessarily mean improved home attendance, which, has 
been poor throughout the '80s. And the outlook for this season, despite the 
high hopes, does not look much improved -- a university official said about 325 
season tickets have been sold.

LOOK AT THE RECORD, NOT THE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lately, it seems to be the practice for candidates who are running for office 
to introduce bills and make statements that make them appear to be 
environmentally inclined and look good to the casual reader. The latest is Sen. 
Pete Wilson's wilderness and river protection bill. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has no interest in protecting the environment, as his voting record 
clearly shows. The bill that he is introducing carefully leaves the Sespe open 
to damming and includes less than half of the valuable wilderness area 
available for protection in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Voters are going to have to be more careful than ever before in deciding which 
candidates to support and not be taken in by statements that are not supported 
by the record.

LENNON FAMILY TO STAR IN VENICE BACK-YARD SPIKER TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lennon-family watchers, whether fans of show business, boxing or volleyball, 
will have plenty to do during the seventh annual Venice Backyard Volleyball 
Championships from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Lennon sisters -- Diane, Peggy, Janet and Kathy -- will sing the national 
anthem before the championship final. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran boxing announcer Jimmy Lennon will introduce the tournament's king and 
queen in his usual orotund voice if health permits. If Lennon, who had heart 
surgery, cannot perform, Jimmy Lennon Jr. will pinch-hit for him -- in the same 
pear-shaped tones. 
</P>
<P>
Among players expected to take part are Denny and Tony Lennon, who won the 
tournament in 1986; 1987 winners Mike Lennon and Mike Sanders and Shaun Davis 
and Kevin Lennon, defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament began with 12 teams in 1983 behind the home of Bob and Jeanette 
Lennon, 932 Harding Ave., referred to as "The Backyard Volleyball Capital of 
the World." Its principal organizers were Denny Lennon (one of Bob's sons), Ray 
Castro and Mike Boehle, a Lennon cousin and a professional on the beach 
volleyball tour. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has expanded to four back yards and more than 40 two-player 
teams. Top players such as Boehle are randomly matched with those of lesser 
ability to keep the matches relatively even, and the result has been fierce 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Boehle, for instance, and a teammate have finished second twice and third once, 
but he managed to win only once, with partner Gary Conley in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Other champions were Brett Palmer-Ivan Smulovitz in 1984 and Mark 
Carrillo-Linda Nelson in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The other back yards are at 944 Harding, home of Elizabeth (Sis) Lennon, whose 
daughters used to sing on Laurence Welk's television show; 919 Harding, where 
Mary Lennon Blaser and husband Bill live, and at 850 Coeur D'Alene Ave., home 
of Pat and Darlene Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament organizers don't seem to be beating the bushes to round up players, 
but they have provided a phone number so that prospective players can leave 
their name and phone number: (213) 823-0941. Calling that number, organizers 
warn, is no guarantee that anyone will play. The entry fee is $12. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't play in the back-yard championships, you are still welcome as a 
spectator. Admission is free.

BRUIN SOCCER TEAM OPENER FRIDAY; TOP SCORER BREAKS LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's soccer team won't have Bill Thompson, last year's leading 
scorer, in the lineup in its opener Friday at the University of Akron. But the 
Bruins will have eight starters and 18 lettermen from last year's 13-5-4 team 
that went to the Western Regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Thompson, who had 13 goals last season, has a stress fracture in 
his right leg and will be out six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Among returning starters are senior goalkeeper Anton Nistl, who needs six more 
shutouts to break the UCLA career record of 30, and three other three-year 
lettermen: defender-midfielder Will Steadman, midfielder Steve Black and 
forward Chris Roosen . Junior midfielder Ray Fernandez, who had 17 points on 
five goals and seven assists and finished as the Bruins' second-best scorer, is 
also back. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will play Saturday at Cleveland State and open at home at 3 p.m. 
Tuesday against Southern California College. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine and UCLA women's volleyball teams will open the regular season 
this week, the Waves against USC, ranked 16th nationally, at 7:30 tonight at 
Firestone Fieldhouse and the No. 1 Bruins at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Loyola 
Marymount. Pepperdine will also play host to No. 14 San Diego State at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday. UCLA, defending Pacific 10 Conference champion, will be led by 
All-American middle blockers Daiva Tomkus and Elaine Young and outside hitters 
Jenny Crocker, Samantha Shaver and Jenny Evans. All-American setter Ann Boyer 
is the only one of last year's starter's who completed her eligibility. Traci 
Broadway and Jennifer Gratteau are trying to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team, 6-5 last year, will scrimmage at 1 p.m. 
Friday at Orange Coast College and open the season at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 9 at 
Chaffey College. SMC, after a Sept. 16 bye, will play its home opener against 
Harbor at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 23 at Corsair Field.

FROM DEPRESSION TO ENORMOUS WEALTH; 
</P>
<P>
WAR TURNED IMPOVERISHED U.S. INTO A SUPERPOWER

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In September of 1939, just a week after World War II had erupted in Europe, The 
American Home advertised why a housewives magazine like itself mattered in a 
time of distant trouble. "Hitler threatens Europe," the ad proclaimed, "but 
Betty Havens' husband's boss is coming to dinner -- and that's what really 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
The ad fixed an awful truth: World War II, the most fearsome and bloody 
cataclysm of world history, caught America napping and unawares. An enervated 
giant, the United States in 1939 was weak, poor, isolated and ignorant of the 
rest of the world. Eighteen other countries -- even Turkey -- had more soldiers 
than the United States. The American Army outnumbered the Bulgarian army, but 
only by 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
Americans were so oblivious of events abroad that James McClure Clarke and his 
roommate left for a bicycle trip through Europe in the summer of 1939 just 
after their graduation from Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the sort of thing a lot of young men did," Clarke, now a 72-year-old 
Democratic congressman from North Carolina, recalled in his Capitol Hill office 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Unaware that war was imminent, they cycled into Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"On every train, at every station," he said, "there were German soldiers. And 
if you greeted anybody, they would 'Heil Hitler.' And even when we climbed in 
the mountains, you would see young people, Boy Scout age, groups of them, and 
they would raise their hands, 'Heil Hitler.' When we were in the Black Forest, 
I remember seeing a big sign put up there by Hitler saying the Jew is our enemy 
and then talking about the Jew in North America, listing Franklin D. Roosevelt 
and Henry Morgenthau and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
That sign, of course, told a lie. Aside from its virulent anti-Semitism, it was 
wrong about Roosevelt, although correct about Secretary of the Treasury 
Morgenthau's Jewishness. But for Clarke, it hit home: Morgenthau's son was a 
Princeton classmate. 
</P>
<P>
War was declared before Clarke and his friend could return to the United 
States. They boarded the British liner Antonio during the first week of the 
war. The Antonio's sister ship, the Athenia, leaving only a few days earlier, 
had been stalked by a German U-boat and torpedoed. More than a hundred people 
died when the ship sank in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Did these experiences make Clarke and others like him more vitally concerned 
about events in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
"Not much, I'm afraid," Clarke replied. "I think it took a while for America to 
wake up. It took Pearl Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, once America woke up, it somehow transformed itself swiftly into an 
enormous, engulfing and astounding dynamo that would shake and cow the world. 
By the end of World War II, a nation once bereft of military strength had 
turned itself into the most awesome military power ever seen; a nation once 
contemptuous of entangling alliances had turned itself, however reluctantly, 
into a natural leader of grand alliances, and a nation still impoverished and 
reeling from the Great Depression had turned itself into an Olympus of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mobilization for war altered society in quiet but profound ways that 
would not make themselves obvious for two decades or more. Rural blacks 
migrating to the cities or fighting in American armies would never go back 
easily to sharecropping and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosie the Riveter," the popular song heroine working in a war factory while 
her boyfriend fought in the Marines, would return to the kitchen after the war, 
but her legacy would lead to the women's liberation movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400,000 Lost Lives 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the carnage suffered elsewhere, U.S. casualties in World War II 
were, relatively speaking, light. More than 400,000 military personnel lost 
their lives -- about 292,000 in combat -- a tragic and bitter waste, but no 
more than a small statistic when measured against the 50 million Europeans and 
Asians slaughtered. There were more American civilian deaths from pneumonia and 
tuberculosis during the war than deaths on the battlefield. The wartime 
population of the United States, in fact, increased by a healthy 6%. The enemy 
inflicted negligible damage on the American mainland in a handful of incidents, 
and the United States was the only belligerent to end the war richer than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Americans owed the relative comfort and low cost of their victory to geographic 
distance, natural resources and a good deal of luck. But many preferred to 
believe that God-given American pluck and ingenuity had counted far more. While 
many Europeans agitated for radical changes in the political systems that had 
driven them to Fascism and war, Americans felt more pride in their own system 
than ever before. An era of great self-confidence came after the war. 
</P>
<P>
"American experience," wrote Henry R. Luce in a Life magazine editorial, "is 
the key to the future." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the year 1939 now seems like a last, lost age of innocence in 
America, undarkened by the clouds in Europe. The Hit Parade was led by a song 
that asked: 
</P>
<P>
 Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those peepers? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those eyes? 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old vocalist named Frank Sinatra joined the Harry James band. Only 3% 
of Americans earned enough money to pay income tax. Almost 50 million people 
glimpsed the wondrous sleek highways and blight-free cities of the future in 
the General Motors Futurama pavilion at the New York World's Fair. New Pontiacs 
sold for $862 and Florsheim shoes for $8.75. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Temple and Clark Gable were the biggest box office stars of the year. 
Hoping to do something about what it called "our national shame," Standard 
Plumbing Fixtures reported in its advertisements that 15 out of 100 homes in 
213 American cities still had no indoor toilets. Lou Gehrig retired from the 
Yankees, and Ted Williams joined the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Telephone Co. explained that it did not hire Jewish women as 
operators because their arms were too short to operate phone equipment. Two new 
products -- DDT and nylon stockings -- were introduced. "Gone With The Wind" 
premiered in a banner movie year that included "Stagecoach," "Wuthering 
Heights," "Four Feathers," "The Wizard of Oz" and "Ninotchka." Pepsi-Cola 
challenged Coca-Cola with a catchy jingle: 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola hits the spot, 12 full ounces that's a lot; 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as much for a nickel too, Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you. 
</P>
<P>
The war probably left the United States with no more dramatic legacy than its 
transformation from unabashed isolationism to eventual guardian of the Free 
World. The day war erupted in Europe, Washington correspondent Phelps Adams 
asked President Roosevelt in his crowded White House office, "Mr. President, 
can we stay out of it?" 
</P>
<P>
The President, who had been awakened at 2:50 a.m. with the news of the war, sat 
silently, his eyes cast downward, for several long moments, and then replied 
solemnly, "I not only sincerely hope so, but I believe we can, and every effort 
will be made to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Roosevelt, sounding more firmly convinced that America could avoid war, 
warned on radio, "Let no man or woman thoughtlessly or falsely talk of America 
sending its armies to European fields." 
</P>
<P>
As far as many Americans were concerned, Europe had botched the peace cemented 
for them by American intervention in World War I. They were in no mood to get 
involved again. Sen. Hiram Johnson of California admonished Americans against 
heeding the echoes of the First World War. "Beware the words 'We cannot keep 
out,' 'Our entry into the war is inevitable,' 'We must fight to preserve 
democracy' and all the Devil's messages we heard 20 years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arthur Vandenburg boasted: "My passion is to keep America out of other 
people's wars." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feted in Germany 
</P>
<P>
Charles A. Lindbergh, who had touched the romantic fancy of both Europe and 
America with his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927 and had been feted in 
Nazi Germany, told Americans at many isolationist rallies that a Nazi victory 
in Europe would not hurt the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
The isolationist mood was so strong that Roosevelt, accused by Republican 
candidate Wendell L. Wilkie of dragging America into war, pledged in a 1940 
presidential election rally: "I have said this before, but I shall say it again 
and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." 
</P>
<P>
Many skeptics believed that he never intended to keep that pledge. But the 
attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941, demolished the issue. With their 
infamous bombing of American territory and ships and citizens, the Japanese had 
turned World War II into an American war, not another people's war, not a 
foreign war. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war, no one could deny the United States the status of a 
superpower, bristling with more military and economic strength than any other 
country. It had led its allies to victory over Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and 
militaristic Japan, and it now had the power and influence to lead much of the 
world in peace as well. It was reluctant to do so at first, but it finally 
faced the reality wrought by World War II: a world divided into two hostile 
camps led by superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, once allied 
against the Axis. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1945," recalled Don Cook, the 69-year-old retired foreign correspondent who 
wrote "Forging the Alliance," a recent history of the founding of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, "you could never have gotten a two-thirds 
majority in the Senate for entering an alliance with Europe. The rump element 
of isolationism in the United States was still extremely strong and still had 
electoral appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew most of the isolationist senators because I had covered the Senate in 
the prewar period. The extent of their conversion from isolationism was a 
reluctant readiness to get into the United Nations. They weren't going to 
repeat the mistake after World War I of not joining the League of Nations. But 
the United States had no intention of using military force in its role in the 
world. The senators had not reached the point of committing our power." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in five years, the United States learned to commit its power and entangle 
itself in Europe and elsewhere. The Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the 
Berlin Airlift, the NATO treaty and the Korean War followed swiftly. By 1950, 
isolationism was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"This may have been the first real major sweeping change in foreign policy 
since the founding of America," said Cook. 
</P>
<P>
World War II also swept the United States into the terrors of the Nuclear Age, 
for much of America's immense new power came from its monopoly of nuclear 
bombs, the kind that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and brought the 
war to a close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Scientists 
</P>
<P>
That short-lived monopoly -- the Soviet Union developed its own atomic bomb 
four years later -- came out of the prescience of refugee scientists living in 
the United States in 1939. Unlike other Americans, they could not ignore the 
awful horror of Adolf Hitler, for they had fled from him. These scientists knew 
that scientific research had made an atomic weapon feasible and that, though 
Hitler had driven many scientists away in his obsession for ethnic purity, 
enough scientists remained in Germany to create a bomb that might ensure his 
infernal domination of this planet. 
</P>
<P>
Three Hungarian refugee scientists -- Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Edward 
Teller -- met with German-born Albert Einstein, probably the world's best-known 
physicist, in Princeton in 1939 and urged him to write Roosevelt about the need 
for an American program to build an atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
In a now famous letter, dated one month before the outbreak of the war in 
Europe, Einstein told Roosevelt that recent scientific research indicated "that 
it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of 
uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like 
elements would be generated." 
</P>
<P>
"This new phenomenon," Einstein went on, "would also lead to the construction 
of bombs, and it is conceivable -- though much less certain -- that extremely 
powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear exactly what role Einstein's letter played in the President's 
decision, but Roosevelt finally ordered an all-out program known as the 
Manhattan Project in 1942 to develop an atomic bomb. American scientists, many 
of them refugees from Hitler, won the race with the German scientists but not 
in time to use the terrible weapon against Nazi Germany. The first and, thus 
far, only nuclear devastation in history, came in the American bombing of the 
two Japanese cities in August, 1945. The precarious reality of the Nuclear Age 
has governed American foreign policy ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans now are too young to remember how poor their parents and 
grandparents were half a century ago. It was no accident that John Steinbeck's 
"The Grapes of Wrath," a long novel about impoverished Oklahoma farmers 
trekking to California, selling for $2.75 a copy, led the best-seller list in 
1939. The Great Depression of the 1930s had weakened the United States far more 
than any country in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all Roosevelt's New Deal programs, 10 million people were unemployed in 
1939, more than 15% of the work force. The American share of world 
manufacturing was lower than it had been at any time since 1910. At least 
one-third of Americans lived in or near poverty. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States had enormous productive potential. In 1938, for example, 
two-thirds of its steel plants were idle. In 1939, it was spending less than 2% 
of its gross national product on defense. If Americans had the will to harness 
the potential, they could create a colossus of fearful military might and of 
enormous wealth. Once the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Americans showed that 
will. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war, the American economy overshadowed the economies of the 
rest of the world in a show of relative wealth never seen before. Americans had 
a higher standard of living than any other people in the world and produced 
more goods per capita than anyone else. Half of the world's manufacturing now 
took place within the United States. Practically any American who wanted a job 
had one. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans feared that unemployment and depression would return after the 
demobilization of the armed forces. But, though the economy would experience 
ups and downs and though thick pockets of poverty would persist, especially for 
blacks, most Americans have lived for the last 50 years in an era of bounding 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
World War II changed the United States in other, less obvious ways as well. In 
1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution, citing the local customs of 
Washington, refused to allow the reknowned black opera singer Marian Anderson 
to sing in the DAR's Constitution Hall in Washington. The blatant refusal 
struck many Americans as scandalous, and the federal government let Anderson 
sing instead, with Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and other prominent white Americans 
in attendance, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the shame of the DAR refusal did not change most American attitudes toward 
blacks. Benny Carter, the 82-year-old black jazz saxophonist and composer, 
recalls what it was like taking his big band around the United States during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Black Hotels' 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't interested in getting into any serious incidents, but it was the 
same old thing," Carter said recently. "My bands were mostly black. There might 
be two out of 17 who were not minority musicians. We had problems about where 
to stay in the South. We stayed mainly in the homes of people -- what they 
would consider bed and breakfast places now. There were no black hotels, and we 
weren't welcome in the others." 
</P>
<P>
As industries girded for war, they tried to hire as few blacks as possible. In 
1941, for example, Douglas Aircraft had only 10 blacks among its 33,000 
employees. Under the threat of black demonstrations, Roosevelt created a Fair 
Employment Practices Committee in 1941 to ensure some kind of fairness in 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
The committee had little power, but its creation was looked on later as a 
significant first step toward civil rights. As the war progressed, blacks were 
drafted into the army or lured to jobs in the North. That began the enormous 
migration of blacks out of rural America into the cities of both the South and 
the North, making the problems of this repressed minority national rather than 
regional. Rioting soon erupted in Detroit. By 1945, the status of American 
blacks had not improved very much, but the war had laid the seeds for the civil 
rights movement that followed. 
</P>
<P>
For women, the war offered, but only briefly, an immense opportunity. The Great 
Depression had made it even more difficult for women to work. With millions of 
men unemployed, a working woman was looked on by many as a usurper -- snatching 
a job out of the hands of some family's breadwinner. Public opinion polls 
showed that most Americans in 1939 would support laws to prohibit the 
employment of women whose husbands earned more than $1,600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The war changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
Factories needed women to replace the millions of men drafted into the armed 
services. The number of women in the labor force increased during the war to 19 
million from 14 million. Nearly half of all American women worked at some time 
from 1941 to 1945. Many took jobs once typed as masculine: riveting, welding 
and operating cranes. 
</P>
<P>
There was a good deal of male anxiety about this. Columnist Max Lerner 
complained that the war may have created "a new Amazon" who could "outdrink, 
out-swear and out-swagger the men." Social workers and journalists began to 
blame an increase in juvenile delinquency on absent, working mothers. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended, millions of women left or lost their jobs to make room for 
the returning men. In Los Angeles, for example, the proportion of women working 
in the aircraft industry dropped from a high of 40% during the war to 18% in 
1946. The sexual division of labor reasserted itself, and many women were 
forced back into lower paying "women's work." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as Secretary of Interior Harold Ickes predicted in a magazine article in 
1943, the role of women would never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is as good a time as any . . . to warn men," he wrote, "that when 
the war is over, the going will be a lot tougher, because they will have to 
compete with women whose eyes have been opened to their greatest economic 
potentialities." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, the numbers of working women never dropped to the levels of the 
Depression and, in a decade, started to increase to levels well beyond what had 
been reached during the war. There is little doubt that the ground for the 
women's liberation movement was set during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended, a nation that had produced 71,000 naval craft, 300,000 
aircraft and 2.5 million military trucks now hungered for more ordinary goods. 
Radio still dominated popular culture, but television, delayed by the war, 
would come swiftly. New products such as dishwashers, garbage disposal units 
and aerosol sprays reached the market. Teen-agers, whose families could hardly 
afford to buy them toys five years earlier, now had loose change in their 
pockets and wanted records. By 1945, the sales of records had increased tenfold 
in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
No one expected the United States to return to 1939. No one wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us like myself who came out of high school in the Depression," 
said Cook, "the war offered us a sense of adventure and change. . . . I think 
practically anybody of my generation would say that the war was decisive in 
framing one's life and one's future. And, in varying degrees, a considerable 
majority would say these were the best years of our lives. They gave us 
momentum. . . . It was tragic for a number of people . . . but there was an 
exhilaration to those times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"One of the best things you realized (serving in the wartime military) was the 
great diversity of the country. Gosh, here you are thrown in with guys from 
Georgia Tech, Louisiana State, Iowa -- it just made you realize what a big 
country it was and how a relatively small percentage of the world the Ivy 
League was. . . . And it was also good for making some of us more confident in 
being able to stand on your own." North Carolinians returning from the war 
"realized there was a world beyond the mountains. They went all over the place. 
They went to the Pacific, they went to Europe, they were prisoners of war. It 
was an eye opener to them."

"Our soldiers were not fighting to make the world safe for democracy like in 
World War I. This was much more of a crusade of our own. . . . The war took 
over everyone's life whether you were drafted or not. It had this sense of 
adventure. I don't like the word 'purity,' but the war had an uplift about it, 
because we were fighting Nazis and fighting for ideals. It had an idealism 
about it."

CALIFORNIA LEADS STATES IN SPENDING FOR AIDS PROGRAMS 
</P>

States spent $252 million of their own money on AIDS programs in fiscal 1989, a 
sharp increase over the previous year, with California heading the list at $77 
million, a study released Wednesday reported. 
</P>
<P>
"As the epidemic spreads, more and more states are feeling its fiscal impact 
and are realizing that there's only so long they can rely on federal dollars to 
cope," said Mona J. Rowe, one of the authors of the study. 
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by George Washington University, found that states spent 
nearly $500 million in combined state, federal and private funds, excluding 
Medicaid, on AIDS activities in fiscal 1989. The largest amounts were devoted 
to education, patient care and testing and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The $252 million spent by the states represents an increase of $100 million, 
62% more than the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"As state and local governments assume increasing fiscal responsibility for 
solving social problems, AIDS will become another of the pressing issues 
forcing difficult political and budgetary trade-offs," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not surprising that the majority of states continue to rely heavily on 
federal funds to support the bulk of their AIDS activities," it continued. "Yet 
few states rely solely on federal dollars, and few of those with a high 
prevalence of the disease have been able to avoid allocating millions of their 
own general revenue to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The study said that between fiscal 1986 and fiscal 1989, spending by states 
alone increased ninefold, in response to the rate of growth in AIDS cases over 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a few states allocated money for AIDS research, reflecting "the 
historical role of the federal government" in that area, California was a 
startling exception, with nearly $18 million earmarked for research. 
</P>
<P>
"California is the only state that has passed several bills supporting the 
development of biological research," Rowe said. "California has a large 
university-based system that has developed an expertise in AIDS. The state 
clearly wants to continue to maintain the initiative in that realm." 
</P>
<P>
California, which ranks second nationally in the number of AIDS cases, also 
outspent every other state in education and in testing and counseling, 
allocating about $19 million in each of the two areas. New York, which leads 
the nation in AIDS cases, was second, spending a little more than $10.5 million 
in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
"California, in terms of absolute dollars, has definitely made a commitment in 
education and information, testing and counseling and research," Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the study, Gov. George Deukmejian said the latest research shows 
that "California's commitment to fighting AIDS is unmatched." 
</P>
<P>
The study said that education and testing and counseling were the two program 
areas most likely to attract state funds. The study said that 41 states 
dedicated general revenues to supplement federal funds for AIDS education and 
information, while 35 spent general revenues to support testing and counseling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
California and four other states -- New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and 
Rhode Island -- are spending $2 to $3 per capita for AIDS programs. The 
District of Columbia, which has a relatively high percentage of cases, is 
spending $9.91 per capita, more than any state. Hawaii is second with $3.62 per 
capita. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to last year, almost all states reported an increase in state funding 
for AIDS programs, although the rate of increase varied. The state of 
Washington, for example, reported a twelvefold increase from fiscal 1988, while 
Georgia reported a tenfold rise, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
But states such as California and New York, which previously had budgeted 
significant amounts for AIDS activities, experienced smaller percentage 
increases, the study said. California and New York reported increases of 31% 
and 35%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
State appropriations for patient care experienced large increases in the last 
several years, the report said. Florida, for example, third in the nation in 
the prevalance of AIDS, budgets about 70% of its state funding to inpatient 
care services, including hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
Ten states reported using state funds for programs involving the antiviral drug 
AZT, the study said.

WOMAN SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR HELPING BOYFRIEND IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cynthia Lynn Coffman, who said she helped her boyfriend kill two young women in 
a five-day crime rampage, Wednesday became the first woman sentenced to death 
in California since the state reinstated capital punishment 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, 27, sitting eight feet away from co-defendant James Gregory Marlow, 
33, tearfully told a San Bernardino County Superior Court judge, "I'm sorry for 
what happened and I'm ashamed that I let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Don A. Turner, who upheld jury death verdicts for both of them, said 
Coffman "was in this thing up to the hilt, and enjoyed it right up to the last 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, the mother of a 9-year-old son, will be sent to the Correctional 
Institution for Women at Frontera. If her appeals, expected to take at least 
seven years, are unsuccessful, she would be executed at San Quentin State 
Prison, site of the state's only gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The last woman executed in California was Elizabeth Ann Duncan, on Aug. 8, 
1962, for the murder of her daughter-in-law in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman and Marlow were convicted of first-degree murder five months ago for 
the Nov. 7, 1986, slaying of Corinna Novis, 20, of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Slaying 
</P>
<P>
The two are now scheduled to stand trial in Orange County for the murder of 
19-year-old Lynell Murray of Huntington Beach, strangled at an oceanfront 
Orange County motel five days after the Novis killing. Details of the Murray 
slaying were presented to jurors at the penalty phase of the couple's trial in 
San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
The two are also under indictment in Whitley City, Ky., for the July 7, 1986, 
killing of Gregory Hill, 28. Police believe that was a murder-for-hire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still very difficult for judges and juries to vote death for an 
attractive young woman," Turner said. "But this jury got to know (Coffman) too 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Coffman moved to California from Missouri, the judge said, because she found 
middle-class married life dull. But when she met Marlow, he said, "the two of 
them just clicked." 
</P>
<P>
"For Ms. Coffman, here was a man who was thrilling, who was exciting, who was 
dangerous," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow and Coffman had once been lovers -- she has "Property of Folsom Wolf," 
his nickname, tattooed on her bottom. But by the time of the trial, they were 
enemies. They asked for separate trials, which the judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman testified that she was under Marlow's domination during the two-county 
murder binge. She told jurors that Marlow had raped her, beat her, and cut off 
all her hair. He once told her, she said, 'I am the devil, and I own you.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said she believed Marlow intended only to kidnap and rob Novis, not kill 
her. After the two kidnaped Murray at a Huntington Beach cleaning store where 
she worked, Coffman said, she helped twist a towel around the victim's neck in 
the motel room. She said, however, that Marlow forced her to do it. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors in both San Bernardino and Orange counties said that while 
Marlow may have been the actual killer, Coffman was equally responsible.

STRIDES MADE ON NEW WASTE DISPOSAL AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders have agreed to create a powerful 
new state agency to oversee solid waste disposal but still are negotiating over 
the makeup of the new board and whether incineration should be a part of the 
package, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Major strides toward an agreement were made during a closed-door meeting 
Tuesday when the Republican governor gave in on some key points and offered 
legislative leaders a compromise plan to create the new board, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal calls for a full-time, six-member board that would 
begin operation Jan. 1, 1991, with powers comparable to the state Energy 
Commission or Water Resources Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
After sleeping on the proposal overnight, the Legislature's two top Democrats 
-- Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) -- indicated on Wednesday that they are 
generally supportive of the governor's plan. 
</P>
<P>
But a stumbling block still is incineration, which is controversial because it 
produces air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Creates a Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"The governor is into incinerating everything, or as much as possible," the 
Speaker said. "That spews stuff into the air, and that creates a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Frost, Deukmejian's chief of staff, said the governor still believes 
that incineration must be part of the state's new policy on solid waste 
disposal, along with recycling and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We fully agree (with recycling) and are completely committed to that," Frost 
said. "But we also believe that another option that should be available is 
incineration. We don't think that recycling and source reduction is going to be 
enough to stop the proliferation of acreage that is being gobbled up by 
landfills." 
</P>
<P>
Frost said technology exists today that would allow for the clean burning of 
trash without a diminution of air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's chief of staff said that Deukmejian's compromise proposal on the 
makeup of the board "was in response to (legislators') concerns raised to us." 
He said he fully expects some give by Democrats on "concerns we are raising to 
them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"One of them is incineration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All sides appear to be in agreement on a establishing a new state policy 
mandating at least a 25% reduction in the volume of garbage collected by local 
governments by the mid-1990s. Ultimately, the goal would be a 50% reduction in 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is in response to the growing problem local governments have in 
finding ways to get rid of ever-increasing piles of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators agree that the primary emphasis on the new solid waste program 
should be on recycling and measures aimed at cutting down on the amount of 
garbage going to landfills, such as expansion of programs that transform 
leaves, grass clippings and other organic matter into compost. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would require local governments to submit a plan to 
the revamped state solid waste management board laying out in detail how they 
planned to meet the state target. The new agency would have to approve the 
plan. The state board would have the power to levy fees and impose penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), chairman of the Assembly Natural 
Resources Committee, is a member of a legislative task force that has been 
advising the governor and legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to create a strong board," he said. "It must have powers like the 
Air Resources Board, or the Water Resources Control Board. The governor's 
proposal is real progress toward that goal." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Deukmejian was talking about requiring the curbside separation of 
trash, which would make recycling easier. Now he is said to be in agreement 
with lawmakers that placing a requirement on local governments to reduce trash 
25% would have the same effect without actually mandating the separation. 
</P>
<P>
Frost said even though most of the methods of collection and separation of 
garbage will be left up to local governments, "I would certainly expect that 
(requiring curbside separation) is one of the methods they would use to meet 
the goals."

AIDS GROUPS URGE FIRM TO LOWER AZT PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Charging that the stratospheric cost of the drug AZT "must be measured not only 
in dollars but in lives," a broad coalition of AIDS organizations Wednesday 
called on manufacturer Burroughs Wellcome Co. to substantially lower the drug's 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The organizations said the urgency of their call was underscored by two 
factors: the expiration of an emergency federal subsidy program for AZT at the 
end of September and the release of data earlier this month confirming the 
efficacy of AZT in delaying progression of the human immunodeficiency virus in 
hundreds of thousands of people with no symptoms or early symptoms of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, whose trade name is Retrovir, costs $8,000 to $10,000 per year for dosage 
recommended for full-blown AIDS, making it one of the most expensive 
prescription drugs ever produced. Even the lower dosage that was shown to be 
effective in cases of early HIV infection costs $3,500 to $4,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The call for lower prices was initiated by San Francisco-based Project Inform 
co-founder Martin Delaney and was joined by 16 groups, ranging from the 
mainstream American Foundation for AIDS Research to the militant AIDS Coalition 
to Unleash Power. 
</P>
<P>
The new evidence that AZT can delay the development of full-blown AIDS "offers 
dramatic promise of buying precious time for the majority of those infected 
with HIV," the joint statement said. But the promise would be hollow if the 
drug's high cost "limits it use among the needy and discourages support by 
third-party payers." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the groups argued, a substantial cut in the drug's price will be 
necessary if Congress is to be persuaded to authorize and fund continued 
subsidies of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not questioning Burroughs Wellcome's right to a reasonable profit," said 
Dr. Neil Schram, a Los Angeles physician who is head of the American Assn. of 
Physicians for Human Rights AIDS Task Force. "But there is a difference between 
a reasonable profit and an unconscionable profit." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's statement was the third time in a week that Burroughs has come in 
for sharp criticism for its pricing of the life-extending therapy, which is the 
only antiviral drug for HIV approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, in an unusual bit of jawboning, National Institutes of Health 
AIDS research chief Dr. Anthony S. Fauci urged the physicians at the group's 
convention in San Francisco to apply "pressure" to bring the cost of the drug 
down. On Monday, the New York Times printed a sharply worded editorial titled 
"AZT's Inhuman Cost." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs, a subsidiary of a British firm that is 75% owned by a charitable 
foundation, cut the price of AZT by 20% in December of 1987 but since then has 
consistently defended its price. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of our marketed products like Retrovir pays for current and future 
research and development," said spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett in a telephone 
interview from the company's Research Triangle, N.C., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she added, "we review the prices of all our products on an ongoing 
basis." AZT confronts the company "with a number of unknowns," Bartlett said. 
"It's very unclear how many new patients may start taking the drug as a result 
of the new data." 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the manufacture of AZT is "a difficult and multi-step 
process that takes place over a period of months." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$200 Million in Sales 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs' worldwide sales of AZT jumped to more than $200 million in the 
fiscal year that ends today, from $159 million in fiscal 1988. The brokerage 
firm of Wertheim Schroder predicts that this will climb to $1 billion by 1992, 
even assuming a 20% price cut and lower doses. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs does not make available profits on individual drugs, although 
securities analysts estimate that Burroughs' gross profit margin on AZT -- its 
profit before marketing, research, and administrative expenses -- is about 80%. 
</P>
<P>
"The next move will be a 20% price cut," predicted Samuel D. Isaly, a partner 
in the New York health care consulting firm of Mehta &amp; Isaly. "It is in 
their financial and economic interest to lower the price," he added, since a 
lower price would spur demand for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Isaly noted that maintenance therapy for other chronic conditions, such as 
arthritis or high blood pressure, costs consumers between $500 and $1,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS organizations, in their statement, said a lower price for AZT "is not 
only morally appropriate but economically justified." They noted that Burroughs 
initially cited its need to quickly recoup its investment on AZT in case a 
better antiviral came along and killed the market for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years later, this has not occurred," the statement said, and new 
antivirals for use against HIV are at least a year away from marketing 
approval.

U.S. STILL GLOBAL LEADER, JAPAN PRIME MINISTER SAYS 
</P>

Despite Japan's emerging economic power and its recent attainment of "equal 
footing" in a once-subservient relationship with the United States, America 
remains No. 1 where global leadership is concerned, Japanese Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"No country can replace the United States in its position and role as leader of 
the Free World," Kaifu told the Japan Society of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the United States can respond to various problems with 
confidence, and at the same time Japan will do its utmost to continue 
cooperating with and supporting American leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu arrived here earlier in the day on the first stop of a 10-day tour of the 
United States, Mexico and Canada. Japanese officials have said the visit is 
aimed primarily at evoking positive feelings among the American public and at 
reassuring the U.S. government that Japan's basic economic and foreign policies 
will remain unchanged amid a climate of domestic political instability. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, whose administration is only three weeks old, is a member of a minor 
faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and his tenure is considered 
uncertain at best. In the past three months his two predecessors were forced to 
resign as the result of bribery and sex scandals, and pressure is mounting on 
Kaifu from party elders who would like to see him dissolve the lower house of 
Parliament and call a general election this fall -- a move that could hasten 
his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Few surprises are expected at Kaifu's scheduled meeting with President Bush in 
Washington on Friday, but Japanese officials said they expect the prime 
minister's skills as a communicator to help defuse rising bilateral tension. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's remarks to an audience of about 1,000, Kaifu emphasized that 
ties between Japan and America are changing dramatically but remain 
fundamentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Association of Partners' 
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relationship "is no longer the protector-protected, teacher-pupil 
bond it once was," he said. "Especially in its economic aspects, this bond is 
increasingly becoming an association of partners cooperating and occasionally 
competing on an equal footing." 
</P>
<P>
Japan overtook the United States as the largest donor of foreign aid last year 
after a booming global trade surplus propelled it into the status of the 
world's largest creditor nation, with massive investments in the United States 
and corresponding power in the international financial arena. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Kaifu said, there has been too much emphasis on the negative aspects of 
the changing economic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We must avoid failing to see the forest for the trees," he said. "We risk 
being unable to see the comprehensive structure of our sound U.S.-Japan 
relationship if we peer at it through glasses that permit us to focus only on 
such recently played-up controversies as U.S. trade with Japan or Japanese 
investment in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of the close military alliance between the two 
countries, Kaifu noted that it was in San Francisco that Japan signed the 
formal World War II peace treaty and also committed itself to a security pact 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has chosen to seek its national survival and development through close 
cooperation with the United States," he said. "San Francisco is where Japan 
decided the course of its postwar history. And I believe it was here that we 
made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Growing interdependence in the U.S.-Japan relationship has meant that "friction 
has occasionally arisen between us," he said. "One even gets the impression 
that we are criticizing each other in ever louder voices. To be frank, this is 
not a good development, but in a sense we might call it a natural one."

VATICAN GINGERLY HANDLES PAPAL WISH TO VISIT BEIRUT

<TEXT>
<P>
Against their better judgment, Vatican diplomats are maneuvering through the 
tangled web of Middle East intrigue and violence in a long-shot attempt to 
arrange a visit by Pope John Paul II to war-shattered Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to what he calls an "interior command," the Pope wants to go 
immediately. But chances are slim that he will get his way, and this would not 
dismay aides who fear for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Who in Lebanon today can guarantee the Pope's well-being? Nobody," a Vatican 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul has been warned repeatedly about the dangers involved in a visit to 
Lebanon, the official said, but is adamant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pontiff 'Insists' 
</P>
<P>
"We have told him how dangerous it is," one aide said. "He insists." 
</P>
<P>
Time and again in recent months, the Pope has decried the violence in Lebanon, 
and last week the Vatican acknowledged that it is trying to arrange a papal 
visit as a peacemaking gesture. But the initial momentum appears to be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Vatican says it is exploring the possibility "at various 
levels." It said there have been conversations with Christians and Muslims 
alike, as well as with officials of outside countries directly involved in the 
violence and in the search for peace: Syria, Iran, France and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As now envisioned, a papal visit would last a few hours and would take John 
Paul to Christian and Muslim sections of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
But the basic arrangements of the sort that have become routine in John Paul's 
globe-trotting become controversial and perhaps insurmountable dilemmas in a 
country caught up in civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"How would we get him there?" one aide said. "Where would he land? How would we 
transport him through the city? Where would he make his appearances? To whom? 
We have questions but no answers." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a papal visit were diminished Wednesday by internal maneuvering 
in Lebanon. Amid parallel cease-fire initiatives by France and the Soviet 
Union, two Islamic leaders warned that a papal visit at this time would be 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah fundamentalists, Sheik 
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who told reporters in Beirut over the weekend that 
the Pope would be welcome, changed his mind Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fadlallah, an influential figure among Shiite Muslim terrorists believed to be 
holding 14 Western hostages, including eight Americans, said that a papal visit 
now could further entangle the search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is "too complicated to be solved by the Pope's visit," the 
British news agency Reuters quoted Fadlallah as saying. "There are 
complications which make the visit difficult." 
</P>
<P>
These reservations were echoed by Nabih Berri, chief of Lebanon's pro-Syrian 
Amal militia, another Shiite group. He told the Milan newspaper Corriere della 
Sera that the Pope's timing is bad. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always ready to receive the Holy Father, but this does not seem to be the 
right moment," Berri said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viewed With Suspicion 
</P>
<P>
The French peace proposal, which is viewed with suspicion by Syria, calls for 
an arms embargo, reforms to give Muslims greater political say and the 
withdrawal of occupying foreign military forces. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Pope accused Syria of seeking to destroy Lebanon and 
Muslims of trying to wipe out the Christian areas of Beirut. That drew 
immediate fire from Muslims. Fadlallah, for one, lamented what he called the 
absence of John Paul's usual "superior impartiality." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Vatican has been scrupulously neutral in its public statements.

SUPPORT FOR AOUN CAUSE: CRADLE TO GRAVE

An East Beirut woman who gave birth to triplet boys last week made it clear 
that in the beleaguered Christian enclave, military recruiting begins in the 
cradle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to have three boys," she said proudly in a television interview. "We 
Christians must increase our numbers." 
</P>
<P>
The new mother and other residents of Lebanon's 310-square-mile Christian 
sector continue to rally behind the commander of the Lebanese army, Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun, in his "war of liberation" against Syrian troops and their 
Lebanese Muslim allies. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1 million Christians in Lebanon, but the power and influence 
traditionally accorded them are in jeopardy. Christians now account for just 
40% of the population, and they are counting on Aoun, who heads one of 
Lebanon's two rival governments, to maintain their predominance against the 
Muslim majority and its Syrian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Outside heavily populated areas of East Beirut and its suburbs, the Christian 
enclave includes scores of coastal towns and mountain villages, none of them 
entirely free of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In one mountainside village, Mazraat Kfardibiane, an 8-year-old Christian boy, 
recently challenged a friend to a game of chess. When his opponent chose the 
black pieces, he announced, "You are Syria." Setting up the white pieces, he 
said, "I am Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
For most Beirut children, formal education stopped last March, when shelling by 
Christian and Syrian forces made schooling secondary to survival. But for many 
of Lebanon's youngsters, political education at their parents' feet has begun 
where the three R's stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Political commitment to Aoun's cause has also caught the imagination of young 
Christian men who once preferred the life of the militias. 
</P>
<P>
"They are volunteering (for the regular army)," said a resident of Elysar, a 
community between East Beirut and the port of Juniyah. "They don't even want 
basic pay." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Dissent 
</P>
<P>
In Christian towns, political discussions over endless cups of coffee produce 
little dissent. Any attempt to play the devil's advocate is met with suspicion. 
The Arabic label khayyin, or traitor, is applied to those who don't share the 
battle cry, "Syria out of Lebanon!" 
</P>
<P>
It is becoming equally popular as an epithet against those who question that 
Aoun will be Lebanon's next president. There has been no elected head of 
government since last September, when Parliament failed to agree on a successor 
to President Amin Gemayel. When his term expired, Gemayel left Lebanon in the 
hands of Aoun, his army commander, who has adopted the title of premier -- as 
has Salim Hoss, the head of a rival Muslim government in West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"I support Aoun in his war against Syria, but I do not necessarily want him for 
president," said a resident of Douma, a mountain village. Aware that this is 
political heresy, he spoke out of earshot of his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Most Christians are feeling singularly oppressed by the five months of war, 
which started when Aoun attempted to take control of ports run by Muslim 
militias in defiance of his government. Blockaded and shelled since March, 
residents of the eastern sector often liken their struggle against the Syrians 
to that of the Algerians against France, Afghans against the Soviet Union and 
Vietnamese against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Aoun's support is in East Beirut, an area he wrested from the 
rightist Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, in February. His turf is 
clearly marked with posters of the 54-year-old general framed by a Lebanese 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
While his popularity extends throughout the enclave, Aoun's direct influence is 
limited in wide areas still under the control of Samir Geagea, 37, commander of 
the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces. There are no Aoun posters where the militia 
maintains its camps. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like Geagea, but people are afraid to put up Aoun," a Douma resident 
said.

A British television station reported Wednesday that 11 British mercenaries 
were involved in an unsuccessful attempt in June to kill Pablo Escobar, a 
reputed Colombian cocaine baron. 
</P>
<P>
Independent Television News said the men were hired by a rival drug gang to 
kill Escobar, said to be a leader of the Medellin cartel. The report did not 
name the rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
It showed film of men in camouflage gear in helicopters and in a jungle, and 
said the "exclusive" footage depicted rehearsals for the June 4 assassination 
attempt. Independent Television News said it understood one of the mercenaries 
made the film. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt failed when one of two helicopters crashed while flying low over 
the Escobar estate, killing the pilot, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
It said the British mercenaries had intended to drop explosives on Escobar's 
house, land and kill everyone in the area. The report said all the mercenaries 
survived the crash, implying the pilot was Colombian.

CAPTIVE WHOOPING CRANES TO BE SPLIT INTO TWO FLOCKS

Federal officials and wildlife experts announced plans Wednesday to split the 
world's only captive flock of endangered whooping cranes to diminish the 
possibility of losing all 54 birds to a single epidemic or disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just putting your eggs in two baskets instead of one," said David 
Thompson, an education specialist with the International Crane Foundation, a 
private, nonprofit organization specializing in the breeding of cranes. "We're 
talking about a whole species here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22 Birds to Be Moved 
</P>
<P>
In November, 22 of the 54 birds will be moved from the Patuxent Wildlife 
Research Center in Laurel, Md., to a breeding center at the International Crane 
Foundation's headquarters in Baraboo, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 whooping cranes in existence, with the only self-sustaining 
wild flock consisting of about 140 birds that migrate between Wood Buffalo 
National Park in Canada and Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Splitting the captive flock will also speed plans for a second self-sustaining 
wild flock of the regal white birds, which can stand 5 feet tall and have 
5-foot wings with black tips, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt to establish a wild flock in the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge 
in Idaho was made in 1975, but the birds have not produced eggs. That refuge is 
still home to 13 whooping cranes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% of Wild Flock Lost 
</P>
<P>
The sole self-sustaining wild flock lost about 10% of its population last 
winter during its migration south, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
John Turner, director of the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, called the split of the captive flock a "win-win situation for 
America's premier endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation is providing a grant of $200,000 for 
the construction of 12 to 15 pens to house the whooping crane flock at the 
Baraboo facility.

MOSBACHER GUIDELINES ON TURTLES SCORED; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE SERVICE CALLS COMMERCE DEPT. PROTECTION PLAN INADEQUATE

<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in a highly critical letter, has charged 
that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher made a serious error in allowing 
shrimpers to trawl without using devices that allow endangered sea turtles to 
escape from the nets. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by Acting Deputy Director Richard Smith, called a new set of 
interim shrimping guidelines by Mosbacher "inadequate" and said he believed 
they would "further threaten the survival of the endangered Kemp's ridley sea 
turtle." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversees commercial 
fishing in U.S. waters, said shrimpers were flagrantly violating the interim 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules call for shrimpers either to use the escape hatch devices or haul 
in their nets every 105 minutes to check for stranded sea turtles. But Brian 
Gorman, the Commerce spokesman, said the U.S. Coast Guard had sighted 409 
shrimpers violating the time limits as of last Friday. Of 64 vessels that were 
stopped, only three were using the devices that would free the turtles. 
</P>
<P>
"They are certainly doing themselves a disservice," said Gorman. "We wanted a 
system in place that would protect turtles and that the shrimpers would 
embrace." 
</P>
<P>
In another arena, environmentalists applauded the Fish and Wildlife Service 
letter, saying that it only bolstered their contention that Mosbacher was 
making a mistake in what they see as pandering to the shrimping industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased by it, principally because it makes all the arguments that 
we've made -- that, biologically, tow time fishing is unsound and could lead to 
the extinction of the species and, secondly, that the enforcement is 
difficult," said Steve Moyer of the National Wildlife Federation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrimpers Protested 
</P>
<P>
The furor over what are known as turtle excluder devices, or TEDs, erupted a 
month ago when shrimpers blockaded ports along the Gulf of Mexico to protest 
the use of TEDs, which were about to become mandatory after more than 10 years 
of study and negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, in reply to the blockade and at the urging of Gulf Coast 
congressmen, at first said the devices would not have to be used for the next 
three months, the height of the shrimping season. But a federal judge in 
Washington said Mosbacher had no right to suspend the regulations designed to 
protect the turtles. In reply to that, Mosbacher set up the interim guidelines 
that will be in effect until Sept. 7, when he will issue permanent rules 
regarding sea turtle protection. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service letter is only one of about 1,000 letters 
received by the Commerce Department during the comment period before the 
permanent rules are enacted. Gorman said all but a few favored use of the 
turtle escape hatches. Shrimpers have claimed they lose as much as 40% of their 
catch because of the TEDS, a figure disputed by both the government and

In the course of the sea turtle controversy, Mosbacher's own scientists at the 
National Marine Fisheries Service urged him not to balk at ordering the use of 
turtle excluder devices. When that was leaked to the press, an internal memo 
was circulated throughout the fisheries service threatening termination if 
employees discuss internal documents with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"This incident demonstrates a degree of untrustworthiness and unreliability 
that, according to departmental regulations, could warrant removal from the 
federal service," the memo said.

BLACK YOUTH'S MOURNERS CALL FOR END TO VIOLENCE

Mourners packed a church and the street outside Wednesday to remember a black 
teen-ager killed last week by a white gang, cheering as the Rev. Louis 
Farrakhan and others demanded an end to racial violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We say, as the Jews say, 'Never again. Never again. Never again,' " the Black 
Muslim leader said to cheers and applause from more than 300 people attending 
Yusef Hawkins' funeral at Glover Memorial Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people stood outside singing hymns and listening to eulogies for 
Hawkins, 16, who was shot to death Aug. 23 in the predominantly white Brooklyn 
neighborhood of Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
The service began an hour after two white Brooklyn youths, including one 
identified as the gang's leader, were charged with murder. Both remained free 
on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police continued hunting for an 18-year-old man believed to be the triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as white children can get away with killing black children, and white 
law enforcement does not know how to make examples of its own . . . then 
justice is far off," Farrakhan said. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the speakers advocated violence, the Rev. Al Sharpton indicated 
the time for a passive response to such incidents had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to let you down. They're going to pay this time, Yusef," 
Sharpton said. "It's time for us to change our ways. We can run a man for the 
White House, but we can't walk a child through Bensonhurst." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins' slaying triggered a racial furor in New York unseen since a black man 
died fleeing a white gang in the Howard Beach section of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"Let freedom ring from Howard Beach, Mr. Mayor," the Rev. Curtis Wells, pastor 
of the church and a cousin of the victim, said in addressing Mayor Edward I. 
Koch. "Let freedom ring from Bensonhurst. We're not going to take it any more. 
We're going to walk where we want to walk." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins and three friends were answering an ad for a used car when up to 30 
whites carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one gun confronted them, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury Wednesday charged Keith Mondello, 18, and Pasquale Raucci, 19, 
with second-degree murder and Raucci with manslaughter.

BILL ON AESTHETICS OF COVERING RESERVOIRS PASSES SENATE PANEL

<P>
A Senate committee on Wednesday approved legislation requiring water officials 
to take into consideration secondary benefits -- such as recreation, scenery 
and aesthetics -- when considering whether to cover storage reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles), was prompted by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's 
proposal to cover several reservoirs. The department's aim was to prevent water 
evaporation and to meet new federal and state water quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
Roos wants to build a home on a hillside lot he owns that has a commanding view 
of Silverlake Reservoir -- one of those that could be covered. But the 
assemblyman told the committee he does not have a conflict of interest, 
according to a legislative counsel's opinion saying he would not benefit any 
more materially than any of his neighbors under his bill. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-4 vote sent the measure from the Appropriations Committee to the Senate 
floor after it was amended to exempt cities and water districts in all counties 
except Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego. The measure already has passed the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by Ray Howell of the Committee to Preserve Lake 
Silverlake, who argued that it was "premature" for the reservoir to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition came from Jerry Jordan of the California Municipal Utilities Assn., 
who said "there may be no economic alternative other than covering reservoirs" 
to meet new state and federal water quality standards expected later in the 
year.

BILL CALLS FOR DISCLOSURE ON CAMPUS CRIME 
</P>

<P>
An Assembly committee Wednesday overwhelmingly approved legislation requiring 
all colleges in California to disclose campus crime statistics to prospective 
students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
With parents of several slain college students standing by, the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee sent the proposal by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to the 
Assembly floor on an 18-1 vote. The bill already has passed the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would allow the Legislature to punish through budget sanctions 
public universities that do not disclose crime statistics. It would also give 
the attorney general authority to fine private colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the disclosure requirement would pressure campuses to beef up 
security and provide better lighting in parking lots and other remote areas. 
"This is going to reduce college crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Figures in a special state Senate committee report released Wednesday show an 
increase in on-campus crime in California between 1983 and 1988. Incidents of 
rape on University of California campuses, for example, tripled during those 
five years from 6 to 18 reported cases. 
</P>
<P>
Property crimes accounted for much of the increase in campus crime over the 
five years, the report showed. But for the last two years of the period -- 1987 
and 1988 -- violent crime actually decreased by 16% on University of California 
campuses and 35% at California State University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators on the committee expressed overwhelming support for the Torres 
measure, and several asked to be added as co-authors. Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), whose district includes four college campuses, 
cast the lone dissenting vote because analysts said the cost of the proposal to 
the state exceeded a committee threshold which would have required the bill to 
be held over until next week. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres said he had the support of both public and private institutions, 
which would likely pay any expenses. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before the hearing, parents of several students murdered 
on college campuses throughout the nation made emotional pleas for passage of 
the measure. The parents haltingly recounted horror stories of their children's 
deaths and blasted universities for callously trying to cover up violent crime 
statistics to avoid criticism and keep enrollment high. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Clery, whose daughter Jeanne was raped and killed in her dormitory room 
by another student at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, criticized the 
"medieval myth that a college that looks safe is safe." 
</P>
<P>
"(Administrators) will go to any length to cover up rates of crime on their 
campuses," Clery said.

BILL TO APPOINT TRUSTEE TO RUN FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF OAKLAND SCHOOLS OKD BY 
PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unprecedented legislation authorizing appointment of a state trustee to 
supervise the financial affairs of the beleaguered Oakland school district was 
approved Wednesday by the state Senate Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The state has appointed a few such trustees in the past but always at the 
request of local school officials. In this case, if the legislation is approved 
by the full Senate and signed into law by the governor, the state will impose a 
trustee on the unwilling school district, to try to solve its fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
'They're going to go broke by next April and they don't have a plan to do 
anything about it,' California Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Oakland school board is offered a $10-million state bailout 
loan, if it agrees to accept a trustee that would serve until the loan is paid 
off. But even if Oakland decides not to seek the loan, it would get the trustee 
for at least 30 days, and perhaps for as long as three years, if Honig decides 
that is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The 50,000-pupil school district faces at least a $2.6-million deficit in the 
next year, despite laying off teachers and administrators and cutting back on 
art, music and sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Sjoberg, acting state auditor general, said an investigation by his office 
found that the deficit will climb to at least $16 million if the district 
follows through on plans to build up reserves to pay for self-insurance, 
asbestos abatement and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen district employees and former employees have been arrested or 
indicted in recent weeks on charges of misappropriating funds or stealing 
school district property and more arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
An Alameda County Grand Jury found 'gross mismanagement" in the district and 
the state controller's office is investigating the possible misuse of more than 
$5 million in state desegregation money. 
</P>
<P>
The district has had no superintendent since last December, and two potential 
successors have turned down the job. All of this prompted Assemblyman Elihu M. 
Harris (D-Oakland) to propose legislation authorizing Honig to appoint a 
'trustee-adviser" to supervise the district's finances for at least 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
'There is a time when the state has a responsibility to step in when things are 
out of control," Harris told the committee, "and let me tell you, in Oakland 
things are out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said the bill means "we are 
going to step further than we've gone before" in terms of state control over 
local districts. But Hart said it is a necessary step because "the Legislature 
appropriates billions of dollars each year for schools and we have an 
obligation to make sure the money is spent properly." 
</P>
<P>
School board members, city officials and others from Oakland argued that 
conditions in the Oakland schools are not as bad as Harris portrayed them and 
that the district should be allowed to work out its own problems without state 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to be held accountable, let us do it our way," said school 
board member Sylvester Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges also said Harris introduced the bill only because he is "running for 
mayor" of Oakland in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee waved aside those objections and approved the bill by a 6-2 
vote, sending it on to the Senate Appropriations Committee. It has already 
passed the Assembly.

N.C. STATE TRIES TO COOL VALVANO CONTROVERSY

RALEIGH, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a regularly scheduled Board of Governors' meeting in a nondescript state 
building in nearby Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
It was Item 9 on the agenda, noted only as, "President's Report." 
</P>
<P>
It was the reason that an otherwise barren meeting room was jammed with 
reporters and the proceedings were being covered live statewide on radio and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
It was the release of an internal report detailing results of a six-month 
investigation into alleged corruption in the North Carolina State basketball 
program. And it was a bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
The report was delivered last Friday by C. D. Spangler, the president of the 
Board of Governors of the 16-school University of North Carolina system. 
Spangler found widespread academic abuse in the basketball program, saying, 
"The rules have been manipulated in order to serve one overriding purpose: Keep 
the players eligible." 
</P>
<P>
Spangler was sharply critical of both the system that fostered the abuse, and 
the coaches and administrators who engineered it. As a result of the report, 
Wolfpack Coach Jim Valvano must quit as athletic director by Dec. 31. The dual 
role was judged to be a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler also suggested reforms in an academic oversight system that appeared 
ripe for abuse and manipulation. He suggested a mandatory drug-testing program 
to replace the school's voluntary, non-punitive program, in which few athletes 
had participated. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that some players had sold complimentary tickets and traded their 
basketball shoes for goods at local stores. Players received a discount at a 
local restaurant and were given special payment terms at a Raleigh jewelry 
store. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the report that Chancellor Bruce Poulton, who had resigned 
earlier in the week, had been a willing enabler of Valvano and others in 
athletics who sought to wrest control of the players' academic standing. The 
report, which stopped short of fixing blame on any one individual, nevertheless 
showed a basketball program that held the academic performances of its athletes 
in low regard. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel H. Poole, who headed the investigating commission, complained during the 
probe that Valvano and some of his players were not fully cooperating. In 
return, the chancellor complained that the commission was improperly conducting 
"a criminal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Spangler and others were clearly concerned that the scandal had stained the 
integrity of the entire North Carolina University system. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it has been, it is, and will continue to be a constant struggle 
to maintain athletic integrity," Spangler said. "Athletics and academics are in 
tension by the nature of their time demands, but athletics and academics cannot 
be allowed to be in conflict in a great university." 
</P>
<P>
The Book That Loosed a Thousand Lips 
</P>
<P>
Peter Golenbock has written nine books, most about professional baseball. His 
collaboration with relief pitcher Sparky Lyle resulted in "The Bronx Zoo," a 
best-selling book about the New York Yankees' 1978 championship season. 
</P>
<P>
His new book, "Personal Fouls," has been the source of more than a year's worth 
of speculation and controversy. The book's subtitle promises information about 
the broken promises and broken dreams at North Carolina State. But months 
before the book was published, some of its allegations were widely known. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock says he doesn't know how an advance copy of the book's dust jacket -- 
promoting allegations in the book -- was released to some bookstores in North 
Carolina months before the book was to have been published by Simon and 
Schuster. Those dust-cover proofs began a controversy that still rages. Not 
only was a book being judged by its cover, but Valvano and the entire 
university as well. 
</P>
<P>
In the resulting hubbub, Simon and Schuster canceled its plans to publish the 
book. Not until "Personal Fouls" was actually published, six months later and 
by another publisher, were the specific allegations made public. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, based on that proposed dust jacket alone, the University system launched 
its internal investigation -- using State Bureau of Investigation officers. 
Results of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s investigation are expected 
by November. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things alleged in the book: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A player dumped the Florida game in the 1987 NCAA tournament because he 
wished to avoid drug testing that winning teams were subject to. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players were given masking drugs to ensure that they would pass mandatory 
NCAA tests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least one star player had a habit of playing while under the influence 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Star players received lavish gifts of jewelry and even automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coaches steered players into classes where sympathetic professors would 
take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Valvano and his coaching staff cared only for keeping players eligible, not 
educating, or graduating, them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There was racial dissension among the players and discipline was 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the more serious allegations made in the book were found credible by the 
university's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, though, and after a lengthy odyssey for the manuscript, Carroll 
&amp; Graf Publishers, Inc., finally brought out the book. Carroll &amp; Graf 
is a small New York publishing firm that annually prints 100 new titles. It is 
known as a reprint house for out-of-print books and, besides mysteries and 
science fiction, has published such titles as "Erotic Reader" and "Maid's Night 
In." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, this small house has taken on a controversial book and allocated a 
$150,000 promotional budget and a 16-city book tour. 
</P>
<P>
No city in the state of North Carolina is included on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Inside Flap 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock writes in the book: "Writing about college basketball is a lot like 
what I always imagined writing about the Mafia would be like." 
</P>
<P>
He said in a recent interview that almost all of the people he interviewed were 
afraid, mostly of retribution professionally and of being blackballed in 
basketball. The book alleges that one former player, who was known to be a 
source for Golenbock, had his shoulder dislocated by an assistant coach. 
Golenbock said that the player's girlfriend was also threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock said that when he traveled to Raleigh, he used an assumed name and 
arranged spy-novel meetings with some sources, in one instance meeting at a 
phone booth at night. Golenbock said he taped his interviews and has the tapes 
in a safe-deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock's previous books have been criticized by some for inaccuracy, which 
has become a major theme in the criticism of "Personal Fouls." 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of some, the integrity of Golenbock's entire book has been 
undermined by numerous errors -- from misspelled words and names to incorrect 
dates and places. The publisher said "as many as humanly possible" of the 
mistakes have been corrected in the book's second printing. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock's book tour has been spiked with tough questions and some outright 
criticism of both the book and Golenbock's reporting methods. Golenbock said he 
interviewed 12 people for "Personal Fouls" -- a number about equal to those 
interviewed for some newspaper articles. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock admits that he misrepresented himself to those he interviewed -- he 
told some players he was a magazine writer interested in athletes who transfer; 
he told others he was writing in general about the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock also admits to having paid at least two players about $200 each for 
their interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't talk to me if I hadn't," Golenbock said. "This is the lesson 
they learn, to get paid for everything." 
</P>
<P>
It is also the rationale Golenbock uses to defend a book that relies almost 
entirely upon anonymous sources. No one, he said, would speak to him on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he could independently verify the truth and accuracy of what each 
source said -- in many instances reconstructing entire conversations -- 
Golenbock said, "You have to look them in the eye and judge for yourself if 
they were truthful." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Golenbock never interviewed Valvano for the book, indeed, he has 
never even met the coach. Each time Valvano is quoted in the book it is 
qualified by, "Valvano reportedly said . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock said he tried "three times on two occasions" to reach Valvano for an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who has not otherwise acknowledged the book, cracked that if he did 
happen to meet Golenbock, he would "tell him that for someone who purports to 
be concerned about education, I'm surprised he doesn't spell better." 
</P>
<P>
Litigation 101 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it started with the attorney general of North Carolina. His involvement 
might have been the first in the lawsuit-threat chain. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from the attorney general, acting on behalf of the state-run school, 
was sent to Simon and Schuster, claiming in part to have found, "an adequate 
nucleus of facts to establish a libel claim." 
</P>
<P>
The school also was in the midst of a fund-raising drive, whose goal was $150 
million over four years. The athletic department is also seeking money to build 
a $50-million, 25,000-seat sports arena. The school threatened to hold Carroll 
&amp; Graf responsible for any shortfall in the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the letters we received, that was the oddest," Herman Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon and Schuster's Pocket Books division had Golenbock under contract to 
write the book, but dropped publication weeks before the February due date. The 
publisher said only that the manuscript had not met its publishing standards, 
but it was an uncommon and expensive move so late in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock, who was paid anyway by Pocket Books, said he was never told why the 
book was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
As the manuscript was being shopped around to other publishers, Valvano's agent 
and attorney, Art Kaminsky, sent letters to publishers, warning of the book's 
potential for a libel suit. Graf said that had it not been for Kaminsky's 
letter, he might never have considered publishing the book. 
</P>
<P>
"There seemed to be an unusual effort to suppress publication," Graf said. 
"That aroused suspicion and interest in the book at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said that the manuscript was essentially the same as what Pocket Books 
turned down, with additional detail. He said an attorney who specialized in 
First Amendment issues reviewed the book. 
</P>
<P>
Graf also said that his company has received several threats. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a few phone calls from people with strange accents, threatening 
to burn us down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, no lawsuits have been filed but it is a sure thing that the 
controversy has helped sales. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Personal Fouls" has become the company's first best seller, and 
will move to No. 5 on the New York Times' best-seller list next week. The first 
printing of 200,000 is sold out, as is half the second printing of 40,000. Graf 
said that in North Carolina, eager customers were pulling the books out of 
cartons. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock has reportedly made $550,000 from the first printing alone, although 
he refuses to confirm the figures. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said: "This could be one of the most important sports books in recent 
years." 
</P>
<P>
All of this, before the book's "official" publication date of Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Fair-Haired Winner 
</P>
<P>
Valvano came to North Carolina State in 1980, led the Wolfpack to the national 
title in 1983 and took the athletic director's job in 1986. Although the 
university received 63 applications for that job, Valvano was the only 
candidate interviewed by Poulton. 
</P>
<P>
"He set it up this way," Golenbock said. "He bullied his other coaches to make 
him AD. They knew he'd take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who is not paid extra as athletic director, is credited with boosting 
the morale of the athletic department. His energy and enthusiasm have been felt 
in all areas, it is acknowledged, not just revenue-producing sports. 
</P>
<P>
"When I accepted the postion three years ago, I did so in the spirit of service 
to the department," Valvano said. "In that same spirit, I will step down." 
</P>
<P>
While not admitting that in his case a conflict of interest existed, Valvano 
did acknowledge that the situation had potential for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, if you have your druthers, you couldn't have it that way," he said. 
"Whether it's true or not, there can be an appearance of conflict. In today's 
athletic world you have to remove that. 
</P>
<P>
"In the three years I was there, I did not abuse that. I am proud of the 
accomplishments I made. I don't think there is a program in the country that 
has had the kind of scrutiny we've had." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine just when or how things veered so wildly out of 
control in the basketball program. Some faculty members, though, had complained 
for years of academic abuse among athletes. Other professors apparently were 
either so cowed by the athletic department or enamored of its success that they 
did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the school's athletic council, an oversight group for the athletic 
department, refused to pass a resolution saying that athletes who did not 
attend class would not be allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
For another example, the Poole Commission's investigation had been closed for 
three weeks before it was pressured into interviewing members of the school's 
Faculty Senate Select Committee on Academic Integrity. 
</P>
<P>
However, some professors and staff members have come forward, at great risk to 
their popularity. And their stories have chilled educators around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A former head of the school's physical education department told the Raleigh 
News &amp; Observer that three failing grades for Chris Washburn in 1985 were 
changed to passing grades. Washburn had been admitted to school with an SAT 
test score of 470. A student who signs his name to the test is automatically 
given 400 points. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Lauffer, who is now retired, said that he met with Poulton to 
discuss the matter. Lauffer said Poulton told him not to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
Lauffer also said that it was routine for assistant coaches to pester 
instructors about the grades of players. 
</P>
<P>
Lauffer told the News &amp; Observer: "The thing that really disturbed me was 
the fact that (Poulton) told me that Valvano was a very popular personality, 
and he was good for the university, and (Valvano) could buy and sell me, so 
there was no need to get into a hassle." 
</P>
<P>
Poulton denied meeting with Lauffer. 
</P>
<P>
It was also revealed that Poulton readmitted an athlete to the university using 
an unusual contract, in which the player pledged to attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
Equally disturbing was information revealed by Hugh Fuller, head of N.C. 
State's tutoring program. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller released to the Raleigh News &amp; Observer seven years' worth of memos 
sent by faculty members to school administrators, detailing complaints about 
poor academic performance among athletes. Fuller is responsible for arranging 
for classroom tutoring and academic assistance for all university students. 
</P>
<P>
The memos chronicle a pattern of abuse both shocking in its brashness and 
clever in its use of the system: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Academic tutors hired by the athletic department did course work for 
basketball players. One player, for instance, would customarily bring to a 
writing class essays written by tutors, then spend the class time -- when the 
actual writing was to have been done -- copying the tutor's work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Athletes abused policies that allow students to withdraw from classes for 
academic or psychological reasons. If a player was failing a class, an 
assistant coach would pull the athlete out. 
</P>
<P>
"You have people whose parents and grandparents died several times while in 
college," Fuller said. "You know, they'd say, 'My grandmother died,' again." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a memo dated Dec. 15, 1986, Fuller wrote to Associate Provost Lawrence 
M. Clark that one star Wolfpack player was "essentially caught . . . cheating" 
in an English course but still passed the course. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fuller said one player was kicked out of study hall after bringing a 
television set to a session. He said instructors were given orders to reinstate 
the player. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano told the Faculty Senate that the basketball program has a graduation 
rate of 86%. The Faculty Senate is the main voice for the 1,445 faculty members 
and serves as an adviser to the chancellor. The Poole Commission report showed 
the true graduation rate to be 24% from N.C. State and 32% including players 
who transferred to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Faculty Senate reported the findings of its own investigation. 
Its report showed a sorry picture of the team's academic health, finding that 
10 of 12 current players are not in good academic standing and that seven of 
those 10 are under the most severe form of warning -- meaning their grade-point 
average had fallen below either 1.25 or 1.95, depending on the number of 
courses the student had completed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information was shocking. Of the 43 players recruited by Valvano 
since 1980, 29 were either on academic warning or had been when they left 
school. Twenty-one of the 43 transferred or left North Carolina State before 
earning degrees. Only two of the 21 had left the school in good academic 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
That report included some harsh language directed toward Valvano and his 
program. 
</P>
<P>
One passage read: "Any subverting of existing policies and procedures to 
cynically foster a marginal academic performance predicated on lengthening 
their academic eligibility is clearly immoral and unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
It is not a new problem. In the 1982-83 season, the year Valvano's team won the 
national championship, the Wolfpack's cumulative grade-point average was 1.67, 
a D-plus. One player had a semester GPA of 0.23. One player had attended school 
eight regular semesters and five summer school semesters. He had played 
basketball for four seasons. Yet he had passed only 76 semester hours and had a 
GPA of 1.12. 
</P>
<P>
Poulton has an interesting philosophy regarding these problems and whose 
responsibility they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Valvano was hired by North Carolina State University to coach basketball," 
Poulton said. "His record as a basketball coach is a tremendously successful 
one. The faculty at N.C. State is charged with the academic oversight of 
students. The athletic department does not have the responsibility of students 
being students. Who gives the grades? The faculty gives the grades." 
</P>
<P>
The Incredible Teflon Coach 
</P>
<P>
Poulton has resigned and Valvano will have to eventually step down as athletic 
director. But why was Valvano not fired as basketball coach? Certainly 
university officials appear sincere when they say they have no intention of 
removing Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any doubt about his remaining coach," said John Gregg, 
of the school's Board of Trustees. "I hope he does." 
</P>
<P>
There is also the matter of Valvano's contract and its structure. 
</P>
<P>
That contract is automatically renewed for five years each Aug. 1. Valvano's 
annual salary is $100,035. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also contains two significant clauses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That if Valvano leaves North Carolina State for another NCAA Division I 
school or NBA coaching job, the school will be compensated $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That the school or team that hires Valvano must pay administrative, 
recruiting and resettlement costs for finding a successor, in addition to 
"potentially increased compensation costs and loss of ticket revenues." 
</P>
<P>
This last is thought to have been a stumbling block in Valvano's negotiations 
with UCLA in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Another clause may be a factor in Valvano's current situation. The contract 
says that if Valvano is fired for any reason other than a major NCAA infraction 
or a felony, the school must compensate him $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Given these considerations, it is understandable that North Carolina State 
officials may be hesitant to fire Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it would be difficult to imagine Valvano doing better for himself 
financially in the pros or elsewhere. His business interests are lucrative and 
varied. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano has curtailed, at Poulton's request, appearing in local TV commercials. 
However, he has begun serving as host on ESPN's "Lighter Side of Sports," and 
through his private company, JTV Enterprises, Valvano oversees various real 
estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
According to the News &amp; Observer, JTV Enterprises is a sub-chapter S 
corporation not subject to federal income tax. Valvano is the company's 
director and sole shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, like many other big-time basketball coaches, has a lucrative deal with 
a shoe company. His four-year deal with Nike is reportedly worth $160,000, and 
the company provides Valvano and the Wolfpack with shoes and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano is also a sought-after motivational speaker and his contract with the 
Washington Speakers Bureau reportedly guarantees him a minimum of 25 speaking 
engagements a year, at $8,500 a speech. If that guarantee holds up, Valvano has 
the potential to earn $212,500 a year just from speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Like many coaches, Valvano conducts a summer basketball camp and has a weekly 
television and radio show, his with Capitol Broadcasting. Valvano's automobile 
is provided by South Square Motors, a Durham, N.C., car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano is also part-owner in a company that designs sports sculpture and other 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a man without options," Valvano said. 
</P>
<P>
He has had offers from both the National Basketball Assn. and other Division I 
schools in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I want to be part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
'Be True to Your School' 
</P>
<P>
On the day Spangler's report was delivered, a banner was raised by students on 
the N.C. State campus. it read: "We're with you, Coach V." 
</P>
<P>
Students here don't appear to blame Valvano for any of the mess. In fact, the 
media are more commonly blamed. Particularly singled out is the Raleigh News 
&amp; Observer, which has been aggressively covering the story on its front 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
Poulton said last week that he had resigned "to spare my family and the 
university the daily outpouring of hate from the News &amp; Observer." 
</P>
<P>
For many here, it's someone else's fault, but certainly not Valvano's. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks T. Raiford, president of the Student Senate, said the vast majority of 
students support the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a fine job as coach," he said. "He's got a great personality and 
great charisma." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Nixon, student body president, thinks the school is being picked on. 
</P>
<P>
"This sort of thing happens at schools all over the country," he said. "We are 
taking steps to see it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
If lessons have been learned and officials properly chastised, it's difficult 
to determine. Poulton, for one, remains defiant, saying once again, "There is 
no scandal at North Carolina State." 
</P>
<P>
And there is a move among the Board of Regents to reinstate Poulton, who may 
himself be maneuvering to regain his job. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also this to consider: 
</P>
<P>
A sign outside the Four Square Baptist Church advises: "Confessing your sins is 
no substitute for forsaking them."

BACK TO WALL, ABBOTT GIVES ANGELS A LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The day after the blitz, when the Boston Red Sox strafed seven Angel pitchers 
for 30 hits and 21 runs in a doubleheader sweep, struggling Angel rookie Jim 
Abbott took his turn on the Fenway Park mound. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations were made. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Clark, scheduled to start Friday night in New York, volunteered to give 
up that assignment and move to the bullpen, just in case. Bert Blyleven 
volunteered to take Clark's turn in the rotation, which would mean he'd have to 
pitch on three days' rest come Friday. And shortstop Kent Anderson, emergency 
relief specialist, volunteered his services again, should things really turn 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evening, Abbott kept them all waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Righting both himself and his team with a startling four-hit, complete-game 
performance, Abbott shut out the Red Sox, 4-0, before 34,182 at Fenway Park, 
moving the Angels back within two games of first-place Oakland in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Angels' 19th, least-expected and most significant shutout of the 
season, all things considered. Among them were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nine-game winning streak Boston took into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The depleted state of the Angel bullpen, which could scarcely afford 
another early-inning washout by a starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fenway Park, historically a chamber of horrors for left-handed pitchers, 
particularly 21-year-old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abbott's recent slump. Winless in his last three starts and 1-3 in his last 
five, Abbott was pushed back in the rotation -- giving him six days' rest 
instead of four -- because the Angel coaching staff believed he was beginning 
to show fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
After shutting out the Red Sox for the second time this season -- he beat Roger 
Clemens, 5-0, on May 17 in Anaheim -- Abbott joked about the cautious handling 
he'd received and all the pregame care that went into this start. 
</P>
<P>
"I should've pitched a complete game -- I've had enough rest," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
But a shutout? At Fenway, whose green walls were riddled by so many Boston hits 
the night before? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they got a little tired scoring so many runs last night," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Could be. Abbott has a habit of getting right to the heart of the matter, even 
if he doesn't always pick the proper place to state it. Abbott made this 
observation to a cable television reporter, whose live feed was patched into 
the Angel clubhouse for the viewing pleasure of the battered Angel pitching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
So when hearing Abbott's crack about the exhausted Red Sox, Angel reliever Bob 
McClure arched an eyebrow and raised his voice, demanding, "What's that 
supposed to mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Gee, give up 21 runs in one night and everyone gets a little sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
McClure was only kidding. The mood in the Angel clubhouse was light again -- 
and not surprisingly, what with Abbott giving every other pitcher on the roster 
the evening off. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (11-9) snapped Boston's nine-game surge by limiting the Red Sox to 
doubles by Marty Barrett and Mike Greenwell, a single by Ellis Burks and a bunt 
single by Luis Rivera. He was only in trouble once, in the third inning, with 
the bases loaded and Greenwell at bat. 
</P>
<P>
The predicament was partly Abbott's fault -- he walked Rick Cerone and Barrett 
-- but Angel second baseman Johnny Ray also had a hand in it. With two out, Ray 
misplayed a routine grounder by Burks into an error, loading the bases for 
Boston's cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott didn't risk another mishap afield and retired Greenwell on his own with 
a quick strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Another Red Sox runner would not see third base again. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a key moment," Abbott said. "The game was still up for grabs. They're 
such a good-hitting team, and with them playing as well as they are, it 
could've (meant) a big momentum swing for them." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Manager Joe Morgan certainly thought so. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've walked two guys and you get an error like that and the other 
team's hot, you kind of expect a score in that situation," Morgan said. "Then 
when (your) guy doesn't deliver, you kind kind of wonder if it's not going to 
be your night." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored all the runs Abbott would need against Boston starter John 
Dopson (9-6) in the fourth inning. A single by Chili Davis, a walk to Brian 
Downing and another single by Jack Howell produced one run before Anderson 
drove home two more with a double to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, whose big league pitching debut was ruined when rain halted Tuesday's 
second game after 7 1/2 innings, added another double in the eighth inning, 
which contributed to another Angel run. Lance Parrish scored from first on the 
play when Red Sox right fielder Kevin Romine, trying to throw Anderson out at 
second base, wound up throwing the ball away instead. 
</P>
<P>
When Abbott continued to coast through the Boston batting order, Anderson knew 
that debut would have to delay until some other, distant day. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, I didn't have to get in there tonight," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, hitting's more his game, right? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Anderson said with a laugh. "Sometimes. Not as often as I'd like." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott took care of the pitching. With a seven-strikeout, 129-pitch 
performance, Abbott recorded his second major-league shutout, helped the Angels 
reclaim a game in the AL West standings and, perhaps most importantly, gave the 
Angel bullpen some time to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important for us to get our pitching back intact," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said. "Maybe things are starting to come together." 
</P>
<P>
That beats the Angel outlook of Tuesday night, when everywhere they turned, 
everything seemed to be falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, a little autonomy can go a long way. Wednesday night, Angel Manager 
Doug Rader credited Jim Abbott's sudden pitching reversal to "adjustments" made 
by pitching coach Marcel Lachemann -- adjustments that entailed giving Abbott 
more strategic freedom on the mound. Previously, Abbott was told when to pitch 
out, when to throw over to first base, even when to step off the pitching 
rubber by Rader and Lachemann from the Angel bench. Wednesday, in Rader's 
words, "We just turned the game over to Abbott." The result, according to 
Lachemann, was a more aggressive and assured pitcher.

CONTROVERSIAL USOC CHIEF ELECTED TO OLYMPIC BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were it not for the money generated by the sales of television rights and 
sponsorships in the United States, most of the 92 members of the International 
Olympic Committee acknowledge that they would be meeting this week on the 
picnic grounds of a public park instead of at a plush resort hotel hard by the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in only three of the last 17 years has the United States been represented 
on the 11-member executive board, which has been described as the IOC's 
equivalent of King Arthur's Round Table. Only the smartest and bravest need 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States re-asserted itself Wednesday when Robert Helmick, a Des 
Moines, Iowa, attorney, was elected by acclamation to a four-year term on the 
executive board. He had no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
That firmly established Helmick, 52, as the most influential American in 
international sports since the late Avery Brundage, the IOC's president from 
1952 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
An IOC member since 1985, Helmick also is president of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee (USOC), a vice-president of the Pan American Sports Organization and 
the immediate past president of the International Federation of Amateur 
Nautical Sports (FINA), which governs swimming, diving and water polo. He was a 
water polo player at Drake University from 1960-64. 
</P>
<P>
Since Brundage retired from the IOC in 1972, the only American on the executive 
board has been the late Julian Roosevelt, who served from 1982 until his death 
in 1986. German Rieckehoff, an IOC member from Puerto Rico, said this week that 
even Roosevelt might not have been elected if the IOC had not felt it was 
important to have an American on the executive board during the 1984 Summer 
Olympics at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any reservations about saying that the United States has not been 
well-treated (by the IOC)," Rieckehoff said. "The United States has been very 
generous. Nevertheless, the little people are suspicious about the big fellow." 
</P>
<P>
In the initial years after the Brundage administration, there also was 
resentment toward the United States because of his uncompromising style. About 
two-thirds of the IOC members have been elected since then, but many of them 
have found other reasons to take offense, not the least of which was the 
U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics at Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick said that the period between 1980 and 1984, when Los Angeles was 
preparing to stage the Games, also was one of extreme tension between the IOC 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a good many strained relationships when a country organizes the 
Games," Helmick said. "It takes a great deal of compromise and negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Left unsaid was that the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee (LAOOC) often 
was unwilling to compromise. It had no choice in some cases because of its 
commitment to private financing, which was mandated by the city's taxpayers. 
But it also did not have to compromise because the IOC had nowhere else to 
turn. There were no other viable candidates for the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Games reaped unprecedented financial profits, thus making it safe for 
cities to bid for future Games, but the IOC still slapped LAOOC President Peter 
Ueberroth's wrist by refusing to consider him for membership. Helmick was 
elected as one of two IOC members from the United States in 1985, followed by 
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the USOC has been criticized by IOC members for demanding 10% of 
the rights fees that U.S. television networks pay for the Olympics. From the 
1988 Winter Games at Calgary through the 1994 Winter Games at Lillehammer, 
Norway, that will net more than $150 million for the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick explained that the USOC simply is replacing lost income. When the 
networks sell the Olympic rings to sponsors for use in commercials, that 
damages the USOC's ability to attract sponsors because it cannot offer them 
exclusive use of the rings. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may seem mercenary to some IOC members, Helmick said that they do 
not understand because television in many of their countries is publicly 
instead of privately financed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of divisiveness because the IOC is not getting the right 
information," Helmick said. "It is not having these things explained. My 
objective is to bring the IOC and the USOC together. I have told (IOC President 
Juan Antonio) Samaranch that we (the IOC and the USOC) could work together 
instead of fighting all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"What's good for the IOC, and what's good for the USOC, is to have a USOC 
member on the executive board. There is a member from the Soviet Union, and 
there is a member from China. It's difficult to see how decisions can be made 
if major countries are not part of those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Also considering running for the one executive board position available this 
year, Rieckehoff decided against it because he also believes the United States 
should be represented. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we always have a U.S.S.R. member on the executive board and not the 
U.S.?," he asked. "That's preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Helmick was a candidate last September in the IOC session at Seoul, but 
withdrew largely for political reasons. With four Latin Americans among the six 
candidates for two positions, he said that he did not want them to be able to 
say that his candidacy cost them votes if they lost. Dividing their support, 
they lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be able to tell the Latin Americans, 'Look, I stepped aside last 
time; now the time is right for me,' " Helmick said. Anti-apartheid leader Sam 
Ramsammy said Helmick won the African votes by supporting the successful 
candidacy for vice president last year of Senegal's Keba Mbaye. 
</P>
<P>
But although he is politically astute, Helmick would not win a popularity 
contest among IOC members. Last year at Seoul, he suggested to DeFrantz, the 
popular president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, that she 
might be more electable as a candidate for the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period, there was a certain segment of the IOC that was apparently 
desirous that I as a person not be on the executive board," Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, 36, said she was approached during the last year by several IOC 
members, who encouraged her to run for the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk is cheap among IOC members," she said. "They might have just been saying 
that to be nice. But Bob and I discussed it and came to the conclusion that 
I've got plenty to do and I'm enjoying learning." 
</P>
<P>
She said that they also decided that Helmick is better able to represent the 
USOC as its president. Even when Roosevelt was on the IOC executive board, the 
USOC did not benefit because of his antagonism toward the USOC's president at 
the time, William Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is a very important National Olympic Committee," DeFrantz said. 
"Samaranch has said that it's the most important NOC. It's essential that we 
have eyes and ears on the executive board." 
</P>
<P>
Rieckehoff said Helmick deserves a place on the executive board "because he has 
been of great help to every National Olympic Committee in the world who has 
requested for the United States to help." He referred to a USOC program that 
used part of its share of the L.A. Games' surplus to finance sports programs in 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
But on a personal level, some IOC members complain that they do not sense any 
warmth in their personal contact with Helmick. 
</P>
<P>
"They think he's distant," said one person close to the IOC who spoke on the 
condition that he not be identified. "When he speaks to them, he's looking over 
their shoulder as if he's looking for someone more important. They get the 
feeling he believes he's better than them." 
</P>
<P>
But a television executive from a U.S. network who also asked to remain 
anonymous said IOC members distrust Helmick because he is independent. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't get their hooks in him," he said. "They're more comfortable with 
someone they can figure out. But Helmick can't be controlled. The executive 
board is supposed to be like King Arthur's round table, and the king, 
Samaranch, tells them what to do. Helmick will do what's best for the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Helmick said he is not concerned about his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any organization like this, it's dynamic and fluid," he said. "People 
have a variety of reasons for being for or against one particular person. 
Alliances change quickly here." 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to make enemies by presenting the U.S. agenda to the 
executive board. But he said he also believes the IOC will benefit from his 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the United States is entitled to a member on the executive 
board," he said. "But in order for the IOC to make good decisions, they should 
have the major sections of the world represented on the executive board. I 
submit that a very important part of the sports world has not been represented. 
When we are, it will be good not only for the USOC but also for the IOC."

MCENROE, WILANDER ARE OUSTED IN U.S. OPEN

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Paul Haarhuis? 
</P>
<P>
"I come from Mars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis, a 23-year-old qualifier from Eindhoven, the Netherlands, scored 
Wednesday night's biggest tennis upset on earth. 
</P>
<P>
And then, only three hours later, Pete Sampras, 18, from Rancho Palos Verdes 
tried to match it. 
</P>
<P>
All Sampras did was knock off the reigning U.S. Open champion, Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
All Haarhuis did was eliminate four-time champion John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night of upsets at the 109th U.S. Open, where 19 minutes into 
Thursday, New York time, Sampras finally finished Wilander, 5-7, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
And all at once, the name Haarhuis became important. It's pronounced 
HAR-WHO-IS. Now, the emphasis is even more on the WHO. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who tried and failed before the match to find anybody in the locker 
room who knew anything about Haarhuis, was strangely at a near-loss for words 
to explain his 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 second-round loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't think," McEnroe said. "I just couldn't do anything. It was 
just one of those days you just hope you don't have in your whole career. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of the last time I played that poorly for an entire match. I've 
got no one to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander felt much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a terrible match," he said. "Obviously (Sampras) made me play bad, 
but I think it's more my own fault." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, a successful player in the juniors but one who has spent his 
professional career volleying in Michael Chang's shadows, warded off four break 
points in the final game before he ended Wilander's misery with a service 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who said he "choked" when he double-faulted on his first match point, 
won his most important match on his second match point as Wilander returned the 
high-kicking first serve long. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say it's a dream come true, but it hasn't hit me yet," Sampras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start, I didn't really believe it myself that I could beat Mats 
Wilander." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe found himself unable to fully correct his first-set inadequacies, which 
included missing all eight of the break-point chances he had against Haarhuis. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe had eight aces, as did Haarhuis, but made only 51% of his first serves 
and won only 59% of the points when he advanced to the net. 
</P>
<P>
And while McEnroe struggled with his service games, Haarhuis won his in a 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis, who had nearly twice as many winners as McEnroe, served for the match 
after McEnroe double faulted at break point in the 11th game of the fourth set. 
</P>
<P>
An emphatic forehand volley winner ended the match after 3 hours 19 minutes. 
Haarhuis found it difficult to express his good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good," he said. "I don't know what to think. I'm just very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 460 in January and up to No. 115, Haarhuis attended Armstrong (Ga.) 
State College in 1984-86 before he transferred to Florida State for two years. 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year at Tallahassee, Haarhuis was ranked among the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s top 30; he earned a degree in economics last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis, who qualified in his first Grand Slam event at the French Open, 
advanced to the third round before losing to Alberto Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
But never before had he managed a victory of such magnitude as upsetting the 
world's fourth-ranked player. If McEnroe knew nothing about Haarhuis, Haarhuis 
knew all about McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him play many times on TV," Haarhuis said. "He's one of the all-time 
greats of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said he allowed himself to become distracted at the Open, which is easy 
but can also produce disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
"To lose to a guy I haven't even seen play before, it's pretty bad," McEnroe 
said. "This is a tough one to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier, Chang was breathing easier. 
</P>
<P>
If this is the U.S. Open, which it is, then Chang must be playing Tim Wilkison, 
which he was. 
</P>
<P>
Chang met Wilkison in a first-round match on the same court where they played 
last year, which seemed odd to Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always in your mind . . . you see him coming in and you think you're in a 
dream," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
When Chang closed his eyes last year, he saw himself beating Wilkison to reach 
the round of 16. Nothing much changed this time, except that the match was two 
sets shorter and two rounds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Clouds gave way to bright sunshine Wednesday, which was a hot day at the U.S. 
Open but just opening day for Chang. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-seeded player began his march toward a potential fourth-round match 
against Tim Mayotte, his Wimbledon conqueror, by continuing his once-every-Open 
series against Wilkison. He won, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's match was carried over from Tuesday night because of a rainstorm that 
had also delayed top-seeded Ivan Lendl from completing his first-round match, 
which he did swiftly Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had no problems defeating Diego Perez of Uruguay, 6-1, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 
but second-seeded Boris Becker needed 4 hours 26 minutes and five sets to turn 
back Derrick Rostagno of Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who saved two match points in the fourth-set tiebreaker, avoided losing 
in the second round, as he did last year, with a decidedly uphill 1-6, 6-7 
(7-1), 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The match turned on one lucky shot, and Becker knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"The guardian angel helped me, but he came a bit late," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker saved his second match point, trailing, 6-5, in the tiebreaker when he 
hit a forehand and the ball tipped the net cord on its way over, forcing 
Rostagno to change his stroke in a futile effort to come up with it. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said Rostagno had read his shot and was in perfect position to volley a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
"The only chance I had to win that point was to hit the tape," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno, who put up little resistence after he lost the tiebreaker, said he 
was done in by a freaky shot. 
</P>
<P>
"If that didn't use up all of his luck, nothing would," Rostagno said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the turning point of the match," he said. "He probably had the 
feeling that nothing could go wrong after that." 
</P>
<P>
Coming back from an 0-2 deficit for a second time at the Open, Becker said the 
match reminded him of his recent Davis Cup victory over Andre Agassi, when he 
won the last three sets. 
</P>
<P>
Becker explained that his slow start was because of a lack of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"After so many highlights in the year, it's very, very difficult to fire myself 
up for the U.S. Open," Becker said. "You go out on the court without any great 
motivation, especially in the second round with Derrick Rostagno. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, it's a match over in four sets." 
</P>
<P>
Chang needed only three to stop Wilkison, a crowd-pleasing extrovert, who went 
down hard last year after he won the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
If last year's match was important for Chang -- he was regarded as too frail 
for five sets -- this one was ordinary. Wilkison thought so, especially after 
the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a better player than last year," Wilkison said. "For that matter, he's a 
better player than I am, obviously. He's still got those real good passing 
shots. He's got the same game, just a better one." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been different if Wilkison had been able to pull out the first 
set, which he led, 2-0, and 5-4. Wilkison had one set point, but Chang's 
down-the-line backhand winner at break point saved him. 
</P>
<P>
Then Chang discovered a groove with his shots, for which he was grateful after 
he lost some of his edge by taking 2 1/2 weeks off following Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl needed only to hold serve to win when play resumed with him leading 
Perez, 2-0, in the third set. Regardless of his opponents the rest of the way 
(perhaps including Mayotte or Chang in the quarterfinals), Lendl said his 
confidence will be running high. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that if I play well I can beat anyone," Lendl said.

ARUM TRYING TO MATCH FOREMAN AND COONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boxing promoter Bob Arum said Wednesday he is trying to bring together George 
Foreman, 41, and Gerry Cooney, 33, in a heavyweight fight at Atlantic City, 
N.J., in January or February. 
</P>
<P>
"George has agreed to everything we've proposed," Arum said. "Cooney says he 
wants to do it, but he hasn't signed anything." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, Arum said, wants to enhance his bargaining strength with Arum's rival 
promoter, Don King, when Foreman negotiates for a championship fight against 
Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"If George were to beat Cooney, he'd be coming off a heavily promoted event and 
he'd be in the spotlight," Arum said. "It would take him from a $5-million 
payday against Tyson to maybe $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
Arum said Foreman and Cooney would both earn seven-digit paydays in the 
proposed bout, which will be shown on pay-per-view television. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, heavyweight champion in 1973 and 1974, has been waging a comeback 
since 1987. He's 18-0 on the comeback, but all his bouts have been against 
little known heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman was 45-2 when he retired in 1977. He won the championship in 1973 on 
his 25th birthday by knocking out Joe Frazier. He lost it 22 months later when 
he was knocked out by Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
When he began training for the comeback in late 1986, his weight was in the 
320-pound range. Lately, he has fought in the 250s. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney hasn't fought since June, 1987, when he was knocked out by Michael 
Spinks. Before that, he had been in virtual retirement after his loss to Larry 
Holmes in 1982. Since Holmes, Cooney has fought four times. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney's longtime trainer, Victor Valle, confirmed Cooney-Foreman negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Arum made us a good offer, and Gerry and I are still discussing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerry is in training now, privately. The date they're talking about is Jan. 
15, at Caesars Atlantic City."

THE RESELLING OF DAYTIME TELEVISION; 
</P>
<P>
'IT ISN'T ALL SOAP, HAMBURGER HELPER. THE PROFILE OF THE ADVERTISER IS 
CHANGING, THE PROFILE OF THE AUDIENCE IS CHANGING.'

<P>
For the last few years, while the Big Three networks wrung their corporate 
hands over the dwindling prime-time audience, they seemed blissfully unaware 
that daytime TV -- that predictable, comfortable blend of game shows, talk 
shows and soap operas on the air between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. -- was losing ground 
even faster. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with prime time, daytime's audience has shrunk less rapidly -- 
dropping only 6% to prime-time's 9% since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But daytime has been getting hit where it hurts -- in the network pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
In prime time, the networks grumble merely that advertising revenues aren't 
climbing at the rate they used to. In daytime, however, the networks' combined 
yearly advertising revenues have plummeted from $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Although the networks haven't concocted any solutions yet, they've at least 
begun admitting that when $200 million is missing, it's time to figure out 
where it went. 
</P>
<P>
"The reselling of this part of the day is going on at all the networks," said 
Michael Brockman, ABC's president of daytime, children's and late-night 
entertainment. "The networks are beginning to realize that they have sort of 
taken for granted this 'daypart,' and it has become imperative for us to bring 
to focus . . . that this is still a very vital and alive and powerful part of 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Johnson, CBS' vice president of daytime programs, described the networks' 
current state of concern over daytime as being "not in a panic, but not 
complacent either." 
</P>
<P>
That's evident in the recent game of musical chairs in the networks' executive 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
The latest plot twists in "As the Daytime Executives Turn": Johnson, who served 
as NBC's vice president of daytime and children's television from 1978-81, was 
hired at CBS last spring, returning to daytime television following a stint as 
a studio executive at Lorimar and several years in independent production. She 
accepted the position at CBS, she said, because she was eager to work once more 
with Brockman, who was then CBS' vice president of daytime, children's and late 
night programming. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Johnson got to CBS, however, Brockman left. In April, ABC split its 
entertainment division in two and named Brockman to the newly created position 
of president of daytime, children's and late-night entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at NBC, Brian Frons, who was vice president of daytime programs, was 
promoted to vice president of creative affairs in May. To fill his position, 
the network brought in Jackie Smith, who was president of daytime programs for 
ABC from 1977 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Brockman's move to ABC is particularly significant. Under ABC's new structure, 
Brockman is independent of ABC Entertainment and, like the presidents of other 
divisions such as ABC News and ABC Sports, now reports directly to John B. 
Sias, president of the ABC Television Network Group. Before, daytime fell under 
the aegis of the entertainment department, rather than getting its own division 
and its own president. 
</P>
<P>
"The awareness on the part of the networks that they're sort of going to have 
to get their act together and figure out ways to revitalize the area, in some 
ways and in varying degrees, is reflected in these changes," Brockman said. 
</P>
<P>
TV executives wistfully recall that daytime was once a great "daypart," as the 
networks refer to the various portions of their broadcast schedule. Compared to 
prime-time series and movies, daytime soap operas were cheap to produce; game 
shows and talk shows were even cheaper. Although industry experts disagree on 
whether daytime used to make more money for the networks than prime time, the 
lower production costs insured that their profit margins were higher. The 
audience the advertisers craved, women aged 18 to 49, were home, they were 
watching -- and they were buying. 
</P>
<P>
Then things changed. More and more women got jobs, and daytime ratings began to 
decline. More importantly, worried advertisers began to divert a greater 
percentage of their money to prime-time TV, rather than daytime TV. Along with 
the same threats facing prime time -- more competition from independent 
stations, cable TV and videocassettes -- local stations are buying more 
syndicated game shows and talk shows now than ever, leading them to pre-empt 
many network daytime shows. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Becker, vice president of television research at CBS, said that even 
though daytime ratings have not dropped sharply, advertisers fear that the 
women who are still at home watching daytime TV aren't the young, affluent ones 
they're after. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers are saying: 'Ratings or no ratings, how can I believe that there 
aren't a lot less women watching? And if I do believe the ratings, who could 
these women be?' " Becker said. "(Advertisers believe) these are probably 
economically undesirable women, if you will -- somewhat older, they are likely 
to be somewhat poorer, and maybe these are not the leading-edge women that they 
want to get. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether that's true or not, those kinds of perceptions do influence the people 
who buy advertising," Becker continued. "Especially since, when I go into the 
advertising agencies these days, the people who are making the decisions don't 
look like they're old enough to be working full-time." 
</P>
<P>
Equally painful for the networks has been an innovation introduced in 1983: the 
15-second advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Seaman, NBC's vice president of daytime advertising sales, said the 
networks switched from 30-second commercials to 15-second commercials in every 
daypart except the Saturday morning children's block because they believed 
shorter spots would attract smaller advertisers who couldn't afford 30 seconds, 
and would provide another option for the regular pool of advertisers as well. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic may have attracted smaller companies, but it also led advertisers to 
discover something else: that, according to research studies, one 15-second 
spot was 80% as effective as a 30-second spot, for only half the price. 
</P>
<P>
Frugal advertisers did not buy twice the number of daytime commercials, 
however. They began buying more prime-time spots with the money they saved in 
daytime. And because there are fewer major advertisers that buy daytime spots, 
the demand -- and the price -- for the available advertising time dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Seaman said the networks experienced the same financial hardship when they 
switched from 60- to 30-second spots years ago, but they eventually recovered 
and hope the same thing will happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there was going to be some dislocation, that it would be rough going 
for a few years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most plans to revitalize daytime are still in the talking stage, the 
networks have taken a few tentative steps to make their daytime lineups both 
more attractive and more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, currently in last place in the daytime ratings, introduced a new daytime 
serial, "Generations," in March. Besides the attraction of a new soap to 
viewers, said NBC's Frons, the network hoped to bring more advertising dollars 
back to daytime: although some daytime executives scoff at the idea, NBC 
believes that soaps are draw a more affluent audience than game shows, and thus 
can command higher advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, meanwhile, expanded its "Home" show from 30 to 60 minutes a day earlier 
this year. Although the 19-month-old, do-it-yourself home-improvement show, 
which Rob Weller hosts, does not represent a new daytime concept, it was the 
first such show to come along in years and provided at least some relief from 
the steady diet of games and soaps. 
</P>
<P>
Neither 'Generations," the story of two affluent Chicago families, one black 
and one white, or "Home" have been ratings successes, however; "Home" currently 
ranks 18th and "Generations" 20th out of 21 programs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, ABC's Brockman argues that "The Home Show" remains attractive to 
advertisers because of its young, affluent audience. 
</P>
<P>
In October, NBC plans to introduce "On-Line, " two daily, 30-second "vignettes" 
providing information on car care, life insurance, health and other such 
topics. Each spot would be sponsored by a company in that business. After the 
spot, the viewer would be provided with a 900 number to get more information 
from the sponsor on the subject. The call will cost between 50 cents and $2. 
</P>
<P>
All three network daytime chiefs point out that daytime TV has never thrived on 
innovation, however. While putting on a new show or changing the time slot of a 
failing one can sometimes rescue a prime-time series, moving or canceling a 
15-year-old soap opera or favorite game show can spell disaster in daytime. 
"It's a life-style viewing pattern, rather than: 'Honey, what's on tonight?' " 
CBS' Johnson explained. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson added that, while families often watch prime-time shows together, 
daytime viewers usually watch alone, allowing them to become more attached and 
involved than they might with a night-time series viewed as the result of a 
family consensus. The fact that the show airs five times per week, rather than 
just one, strengthens the habit. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of racing to change their schedules, the networks instead hope to 
infuse new money into daytime by persuading advertisers that, although it may 
not be reflected in the Nielsen ratings, working women still find time for 
daytime TV. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, ABC recently released two studies contending that the Nielsen 
ratings, which only measure viewing done in the home, fail to account for 
nearly three million women who watch soap operas while at work, on communal TV 
sets in college dorms, in lunch rooms, hospitals and on portable televisions 
almost anywhere. And all three networks are reminding advertisers that many 
working women now tape their favorite daytime shows and watch them in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Johnson, advertisers need to know that women who work are also women 
with money. Hyundai recently became the first auto manufacturer to buy a spot 
on a soap opera, and others have followed. "It isn't all soap and Hamburger 
Helper anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The profile of the advertiser is changing, the profile of the audience is 
changing. It's all in transition now."

<P>
ON THE WAGON AND OUT OF COURT, EX-BEATLE TOURS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
"It was madness -- madness on a scale you wouldn't believe," said former 
Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, recalling the Fab Four's final tour in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like we had it all under control, but we didn't sometimes. I don't 
think people have gotten that crazy over a band since. It was this wild 
merry-go-round that kept spinning faster and faster. Sometimes, it was enough 
to drive you to drink." 
</P>
<P>
That last comment was a wry reference to the fact that Starr is a recovering 
alcoholic, a condition that's received as much attention in the last few months 
as his first tour since the Beatles' final concert in San Francisco in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking coffee in a sprawling suite in a Beverly Hills hotel, Starr was 
talking about the old Beatles days because, as a touring performer, that's his 
last frame of reference. He's currently touring with what he calls the 
All-Starr Band, with dates Saturday at the Pacific Amphitheatre and Sunday and 
Monday at the Greek Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
But Starr didn't appear to have much fun reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of what happened in those days was great but some of it was bad," he 
said. "Fans may have more fun remembering those days than we do." 
</P>
<P>
Starr, who has a very dry wit and a deep, droning voice, didn't come across as 
a legend. You quickly forgot that he's an ex-Beatle and focused on the fact 
that he's a 49-year-old grandfather who was wearing hip, colorful garb and dark 
shades, with his hair slicked back into a ponytail. His manner was basically 
easygoing, but touches of smugness and arrogance did surface at times. 
</P>
<P>
Starr didn't want to dwell on the Beatles. He was impatient discussing the old 
days, as if he'd answered one question too many about the Fab Four. "I've 
talked a lot about it," he said. "That's all people want to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
A favorite question is how he relates to fellow ex-Beatles George Harrison and 
Paul McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
"We're friends in a strange way," Starr said. "We're like a family. We get 
along sometimes and sometimes we don't. But more often, we get along." 
</P>
<P>
Will he go to see McCartney in concert? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he replied. "If I were in the same town, I wouldn't miss it. I've seen 
him every other time he's played." 
</P>
<P>
Chuckling, he added: "Maybe I can offer him some tips." 
</P>
<P>
Starr's wife, actress Barbara Bach, popped into the room and reminded him that 
he had to leave soon to catch a plane. "This tour is quieter than the last 
one," he said. "It's hectic but not like that other one. A sane tour is even 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for this tour wasn't Starr's. Promoter-agent David Fishof talked him 
into it. A few years ago, Starr had turned down Fishof's offer to sponsor a 
tour, but back then Starr was still drinking heavily. Last October, he and Bach 
checked into a rehab center and have been sober ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was suddenly ready to work. "I needed to do something creative," he said. 
"Hitting the road seemed like a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
In the two-hour show, Starr sings 10 songs, leaving some of the drumming to 
Levon Helm and Jim Keltner. "I knew I couldn't hold an audience by singing a 
whole show," he said. "Not with my singing." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, most critics have been kind, but some have been nasty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the greatest singer," he admitted. "People know that. What people get 
from me when I sing is a feeling of fun and good spirits. It's not great 
singing but people can connect with it. What I do best is connect with the 
audience. If I can convey this good feeling when I sing, and touch people with 
it, then I've done what I've set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
When he was assembling this band last spring, some of the old pals he called 
were also singers who could help him carry the show. The band includes 
guitarists Joe Walsh and Nils Lofgren, bassist Rick Danko, sax player Clarence 
Clemons and keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr. John. 
</P>
<P>
"The point was to surround myself with very talented, known people," Starr 
said. "They push you and make you better. But also, it's more interesting for 
the audience with those great musicians up there on stage." 
</P>
<P>
After the Beatles split in 1970, Starr, then a hot item, parlayed some of that 
star power into a successful solo recording career. His 1973 album "Ringo" 
featured the hit singles "Oh My My," "You're Sixteen" and "Photograph." But 
since then, his recording career has been all downhill. A 1984 album, "Old 
Wave," came out in Canada and Germany but was ignored by American labels. 
</P>
<P>
Starr has been in the news recently because of a suit involving an album he 
recorded with producer Chips Moman in 1987. In Fulton County Superior Court in 
Atlanta, Ga., Starr is trying to keep the album from being released; the 
Memphis producer wants to release it now to take advantage of the publicity 
surrounding Starr's tour. Moman demanded Starr pay more than $146,000 to 
prevent the release of the album, but Starr rejected that offer. 
</P>
<P>
The drum tracks on the album, Starr said, were recorded by other drummers. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to record my own drum tracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the drumming isn't the primary reason Starr wants this album off the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very good," he said. "I want to put it on hold, maybe add some more 
numbers. It needs a lot of work. No major record company wanted that record -- 
ex-Beatle or not. That should tell you something about the quality of the 
album." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Starr doesn't have a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the right offer came along, I'd take it," he said. "I'm ready to work 
again. The drinking problem may have been a stumbling block before, but that's 
out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
The shows on the current tour are being recorded -- partially financed by 
Starr. The plan, he said, is to make a deal with some company to market the 
live album. 
</P>
<P>
"This tour has taught me a lot," he said. "It's given me some confidence. I 
know I can sing. I know I can do well for some record company. All I need is a 
chance to prove it."

<P>
CRITIC AT LARGE: A DIRECTOR'S LEGACY FROM TRUFFAUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Francois Truffaut," said the French director Claude Miller during a recent 
visit to Los Angeles, "was there as a friendly ghost watching over us." 
</P>
<P>
A year before he died, in 1984 at the tragically young age of 52, Truffaut and 
Claude de Givray had completed a 35-page treatment of "The Little Thief," about 
a truant teen-age girl who is for all the world a sister in spirit to Antoine 
Doinel, the hero of Truffaut's "The 400 Blows." ("Little Thief" opens Friday at 
the Royal.) 
</P>
<P>
Realizing he would not live to make the film, Truffaut asked his friend, the 
producer-director Claude Berri ("The Two of Us"), to do it. But Berri, 
preparing "Jean de Florette," could not and, after Truffaut's death, he turned 
to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Miller had the assignment, at once enviable, daunting and melancholy, of 
making Francois Truffaut's last film. The choice made sense; Miller had worked 
closely with Truffaut for a decade, as his production manager on several films. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1967 I was working as an assistant director to Jean-Luc Godard on 'Two Or 
Three Things I Know About Her,' " Miller said through an interpreter. "Suzanne 
Schiffman was the script girl on the film and she and I got along. Later she 
asked me if I wanted to work with Truffaut on 'Stolen Kisses.' 
</P>
<P>
"I surely did. For 10 years I was with him on every film, from 'Stolen Kisses' 
to 'The Story of Adele H.' 'The Wild Child,' 'Day for Night,' 'Two English 
Girls,' all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Miller last chatted with Truffaut only two months before he died. "Even then he 
only wanted to talk about cinema." 
</P>
<P>
Janine Castang, the troubled girl who is the little thief, was to have been a 
character in "The 400 Blows," Miller says. "But Truffaut realized he had too 
much material already, and he put her aside, intending to make her story 
later." 
</P>
<P>
The story treatment Miller inherited included, he says, all the characters, a 
well-described analysis of her psychology and the chronology of the story. 
Miller co-authored the shooting script with Luc Beraud and Annie Miller, his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Truffaut didn't say everything he had to say about youth in '400 Blows,' " 
Miller believes. "Janine was intended to expose more things about Truffaut 
himself. One area in particular that was not exposed in '400 Blows' was 
sexuality, and he wanted to explore that through Janine in 'The Little Thief.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
"The 400 Blows," Truffaut's first feature after two attention-getting and 
still-shown short films, was a remarkable autobiographical document, reflecting 
the turmoil of Truffaut's own troubled youth, which included a term in reform 
school for theft. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud from age 12, was followed through a 
short film ("Love at Twenty") and three features ("Stolen Kisses," "Bed and 
Board" and "Love On the Run"), a sequence without exact counterpart in film 
history, and reflecting Truffaut's own arrival at a secure manhood after the 
terrors of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy and the girl are both revolting against the world at large, and 
especially against the world of adults. They both want to experience everything 
for the first time, including love and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
One story element not in the treatment but added by Miller (and evidently OKd 
by the friendly hovering ghost) is Janine's discovery of photography. "The 
whole photography thing is an homage to Francois," Miller says. "At 17 he had 
been in all kinds of trouble but he was saved by his love of cinema." 
</P>
<P>
What made "The Little Thief" workable was the actress Miller knew was available 
to play her. Charlotte Gainsbourg, born into show business as the daughter of 
actress Jane Birkin and singer Serge Gainsbourg, had worked for Miller when she 
was only 14, in a film called "L'Effrontee." She was 17 when she filmed "The 
Little Thief," and she has already received extraordinary reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps one of the reasons Truffaut didn't make 'The Little Thief' himself 
earlier in his career is that he didn't know Charlotte, that is, he didn't know 
an actress who could do Janine. After we did 'L'Effrontee' three years ago, she 
became part of the family. She was there when we were working on the script. We 
discussed the character with her. That's why I said yes to Claude (Berri) in 
the first place. I knew she could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Miller adds: "I can't remember whether it was Capra or Hitchcock who said the 
three most important things about a film are, first, the script, second, the 
script, and third, the script. But it is true," Miller says, "and with 
Francois' treatment and his spirit to guide you" -- he pauses eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The 400 Blows," "The Little Thief" is open-ended, a cliffhanger even. But 
Miller says he is optimistic about Janine. "At 16 or 17 you have your whole 
life ahead of you, as Truffaut did. And all those experiences, although as bad 
as they are, are good for your overall learning of life. That which doesn't 
kill you makes you stronger, as someone says." 
</P>
<P>
It is tantalizing to think of future glimpses of Janine -- in her own 
equivalents of "Stolen Kisses" and "Bed and Board." But Miller says it cannot 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have the right to do the film based on Truffaut's treatment. We don't 
have the right to continue because the characters are not our own. We are not 
entitled."

SALT SENSITIVITY IN OBESE CHILDREN CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fat youngsters are harmed more by a high-salt diet than slim children, and this 
helps explain why overweight people are especially prone to get high blood 
pressure, according to a new study. When obese adolescents switched from a 
high-salt to a low-salt diet, their blood pressures fell dramatically. But this 
change in food had no significant effect on normal-size youngsters. When fat 
children lost weight, their blood pressures also fell, and they stopped being 
sensitive to salt in their diets. The study was directed by Dr. Albert P. 
Rocchini of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor and was due 
to be published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. Experts have long 
known that people who lose weight also lower their blood pressure. The 
researchers theorized that overweight people get high blood pressure because 
their bodies are less efficient at getting rid of salt.

Moldavian leaders tried to placate outraged minority groups by considering a 
watered-down version of a plan to make their native tongue the official 
language of the ethnically diverse Soviet republic. Legislative leaders, 
reportedly at the urging of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, are leaning 
toward adopting the compromise to try to stop strikes by Russians and other 
groups opposed to the pending language law. The original proposal would make 
Moldavian the only official language of the republic. The compromise plan would 
make it the language of government officials and documents, while Russian would 
be the language for everyday contacts.

Borrowing technology from the space program, a new computerized, implanted 
insulin pump controlled by radio signals and computer chips appears to help 
some diabetics avoid daily insulin injections, researchers reported. The hockey 
puck-sized device is "a significant advance," said Dr. Christopher D. Saudek of 
Johns Hopkins University, who helped test the device. Researchers said they 
plan to test a slightly modified version before seeking Food and Drug 
Administration approval, and noted it could be years away from becoming 
commercially available. The pump was tested on 18 diabetics. Doctors said it 
generally worked well, although four of the devices became blocked when tissue 
grew over the catheter that releases the insulin. One also malfunctioned 
because of a faulty microchip.

A convicted drug dealer told federal investigators that he used crack cocaine 
on repeated occasions with Washington Mayor Marion Barry last December, a 
television station reported. Charles Lewis, convicted in April on cocaine 
trafficking charges in the Virgin Islands, told federal investigators he 
repeatedly used drugs with Barry at Lewis' hotel room, according to 
Washington's WUSA-TV. Barry, who has vehemently denied ever using drugs, has 
twice testified before a federal grand jury investigating the matter. He has 
also repeatedly denied seeing any drugs or drug use in Lewis' hotel room. Barry 
is vacationing at an undisclosed location.

POLICE ARREST TUTU'S WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested the wife of Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and about 200 
other women in central Cape Town as they protested South African capital 
punishment and the detention of children. "I'm very proud," Tutu said after 
hearing that his wife, Leah, was arrested while trying to march to the British 
Embassy to ask Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to intercede on the issues. 
"The women have shown us up. They have shown us how to organize these things." 
The march defied a ban on open-air protests. The women were released later 
pending a hearing. In another incident, police fired shotguns and tear gas in 
clashes with hundreds of students in Cape Town's Colored (mixed-race) suburbs. 
Three students were wounded in the anti-apartheid protest.

"The Cubans won!" salsa singer Celia Cruz shouted in Spanish as Cuban-Americans 
and southern Republicans celebrated Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's election to Congress 
in Miami. Ros-Lehtinen defeated Gerald Richman after an ethnically divisive 
campaign for the late Claude Pepper's seat. "Now it's time for healing, now we 
have to reach out to all those (ethnically divided) sections," Ros-Lehtinen 
declared. Ros-Lehtinen is the first Cuban-American elected to Congress. 
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater expressed delight at the GOP's latest 
Southern success; the party picked up a seat held by a liberal Democrat for 27 
years and won its first congressional victory in Dade County.

The Israeli military has drawn up a long-term plan that assumes its troops will 
still occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the year 2000, an army spokeswoman 
said. She said the plan, to be presented to the Cabinet next week, envisages 
troops spending their entire three-year compulsory service in the territories, 
scene of a 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, instead of the current rotating 
tours of duty. Meanwhile, another Israeli army spokesman said the military is 
creating a special unit to help put down the uprising after experimenting with 
soldiers specially trained in riot control.

Iraq has completed the forced relocation of thousands of Kurds, an Iraqi 
government spokesman said. Citing security reasons, Iraq announced June 26 that 
it was clearing Kurdish and Arab citizens from a 20-mile-wide strip along its 
borders with Iran and Turkey. Iraq has not confirmed the number of Kurds 
relocated, but estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000. Meanwhile, Iraqi 
officials said they hope media coverage they are arranging for a Kurdish 
election in two weeks will dispel "myths" of reported suffering caused by the 
relocation.

Building inspector Tom Harmon declared the building in this resort community

Lake Ozark Mayor Rick Moss said he saw the action as a positive step toward

DISPATCHER'S ACTIONS DEFENDED AFTER KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on Wednesday strongly defended the 
actions of a 911 emergency dispatcher who turned down a young woman's request 
for police protection after she had been warned that a gunman was en route to 
her home to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
The 911 call occurred shortly before Maria Navarro, 27, and three house guests 
were shot to death late Sunday in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the decisions we make don't turn out the way we wish they would . . 
. (but) that doesn't make the decision itself faulty," Block told reporters at 
a downtown press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Block announced that he had closed his own brief review of the dispatcher's 
role in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Clear and Present Danger' 
</P>
<P>
"We just cannot respond to every threat unless there is a clear and present 
danger," Block said. "The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly. She did 
not violate any established department procedures. Based upon the circumstances 
of the call . . . we don't see or find any fault with the manner in which she 
handled it." 
</P>
<P>
A survivor of the 11 p.m. shooting incident, meanwhile, told The Times that 
guests there, like the Sheriff's Department dispatcher, were not sure what to 
make of the initial warning Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
After Navarro received a telephone warning that her estranged husband was 
driving to her home -- a converted garage in the 3600 block of Lanfranco Street 
-- to kill her, she dialed 911 and tried vainly to get police protection at the 
house, guest Martin Gamboa said. 
</P>
<P>
After being told that no officers could be sent unless the estranged husband 
was present, Navarro hung up the phone and was "shaking and crying," Gamboa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maria said, 'What kind of police are these that won't send help? If he comes 
and kills people, what are we going to do?' " Gamboa recalled. 
</P>
<P>
However, the party continued, with the door to the home unlocked, while a guest 
stood watch near the street to await the possible arrival of the husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't leave because he'd threatened to kill her before but never followed 
through," Gamboa recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparently Scaled a Wall 
</P>
<P>
A short while later, a gunman identified by authorities as Raymond Navarro, 26, 
apparently scaled a wall and entered the home from the rear, avoiding the 
lookout and shooting six people, killing four of them. 
</P>
<P>
Two others are still being treated at L.A. County-USC Medical Center. Raymond 
Navarro, Maria Navarro's estranged husband, was arrested five hours after the 
killings and is scheduled for arraignment on murder charges Tuesday in East Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
In addressing the case Wednesday, Block said threats of violence are reported 
to 911 dispatchers "all the time" and that about half of the 50,000 calls that 
pour in at the East Los Angeles sheriff's station each year turn out to be 
non-emergencies. About a fourth of those 50,000 calls are pranks, he said, and 
a fourth are mistakes or temporary crises that do not require police 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Block said he had no figures on the number of threats reported to dispatchers. 
He added, however, that patrol cars are sent to respond only about 25% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that, more times than not, when 911 (calls) are made, there is 
no emergency when the (officers) get there," he said. "There is a difference 
between an immediate threat -- a clear and present danger -- and something 
that's just a threat. If someone's banging on your door or trying to get into 
your house, yes, we'll try to get there to prevent a crime." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff emphasized the dispatcher's instructions to Navarro to prevent the 
estranged husband from entering the house and to telephone again if he arrived. 
However, Block did not discuss the woman's apparent assertion that the attack 
would be carried out. At one point, Navarro told the dispatcher, "I'm sure he 
will," in discussing the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said one deputy who later arrived at the small home cursed and asked, 
"What do you mean, somebody called earlier?" The deputy appeared to express 
contempt for the 911 system, said Gamboa, who did not know the deputy's name. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher's decision to withhold assistance continued to draw mixed 
reactions from community members. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Cuevas, coordinator of the Domestic Violence Prevention program for the 
privately run Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, criticized 
Block for his "hard-line" defense of the dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"She may have been following procedure to the letter, but she did not show any 
compassion," Cuevas said. "She did not try to work with the woman to try to 
find other resources. . . . She could have suggested she call the (police) 
desk" to further discuss a plan of action. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't give (Navarro) any options at all," Cuevas said. "I thought she 
just shrugged her off." 
</P>
<P>
However, Block denied that Navarro was treated callously, pointing out that the 
veteran dispatcher was both female and a Latina. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Garcia, a member of one East Los Angeles gang-prevention program, also 
defended the dispatcher's decision, saying: "Most citizens don't realize the 
pressure, the amount of calls, that dispatchers receive on a daily basis."

GANG INVADES HOUSE; 1 OF 11 INSIDE SLAIN;

In a confusing standoff in Watts, police officers said they encircled a house 
for five hours Wednesday after an armed gang, apparently bent on kidnaping for 
ransom, invaded a residence occupied by 11 illegal alien Salvadorans and shot 
one of them to death. Police eventually stormed the house, only to find it 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said five of the attackers were arrested a few minutes after the 
shooting as they attempted to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Ten occupants, carrying the fatally wounded man, ran from the home after the 
arrests, but police said they continued to surround the home in the 100 block 
of East 94th Street in the mistaken belief that still more of the attackers and 
victims were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about 12:20 p.m., the officers lobbed tear gas into the residence 
and went inside, but the modest, two-bedroom home was empty. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the man who was shot to death was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said an off-duty LAPD reserve officer happened to be walking by the 
home at about 6:45 a.m. Wednesday when he saw the gang of armed men pull up in 
six vans and enter the home from a rear door that faces onto an alley. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were trying to take (the aliens) out and put them in another 
house in what clearly was a case of (kidnaping for) ransom," LAPD Lt. Bob 
Kimball said. Kimball said the attackers hoped to extort money from the 
victims' relatives in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after entering the house, the attackers shot one of the residents and 
pistol-whipped another, Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
He said detectives did not immediately determine why the two victims were 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the off-duty officer, who was not identified, called for 
help, and within a few minutes the house, which sits at the rear of a lot 
behind another home, was surrounded by dozens of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
At about 7 a.m., five of the attackers left the house and were taken 
immediately into custody, police said. Several other members of the gang were 
believed to have escaped during the arrests. Officers said they recovered two 
pistols, two shotguns and a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, police said, the surviving victims left the home carrying their 
fatally wounded companion. The man they carried out was taken to Martin Luther 
King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died about six hours later of a single 
gunshot wound in the head. The unidentified man who was pistol-whipped was 
treated for his injuries. A report on his condition was not available. 
</P>
<P>
The five suspects, none of whom were identified by police, were booked on 
suspicion of murder. The aliens were placed in the custody of federal 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Police, unaware that the home was empty, continued to surround the place 
throughout the morning, lobbing tear gas in about two hours before they entered 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-hour episode, residents were evacuated from about 20 homes 
surrounding the house where the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Cleia Thompson, who owns the house where the attack occurred and lives in 
another home in front, said she had no idea the house at the back was occupied 
by illegal aliens. She said she had rented it to a man named Carlos, who lived 
there with his wife, Elsie, their two daughters and a number of other people. 
</P>
<P>
"They mostly kept to themselves," she said. "You couldn't hear nothing . . . no 
fussing, no fighting, no loud noise." 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors complained that the chickens that the occupants raised wandered 
into neighboring yards and that their dilapidated cars lined the street. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's daughter said some of those residing at the house were sleeping in 
the back yard "under the trees." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's nephew, Darren Johnson, said large amounts of food were taken in to 
feed the group. 
</P>
<P>
"People would be . . . carrying in sacks of taco shells and beans and all kinds 
of food," Johnson said. "They could have supported a whole school." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said she had warned Carlos last week that too many people were living 
in the tiny house. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him they'd have to leave," she said. "He said, 'They're relatives. 
They're just visiting.' I didn't see them no more after that."

BALLISTICS FLAW CITED; MURDER COUNT DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in recent months, prosecutors dropped charges against a 
high-profile murder suspect because of disputed ballistics work by a Los 
Angeles Police Department firearms examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped their case against Alex Marti, 27, who had 
been charged in the murder of a suspected drug dealer whose body was found in 
Bel-Air two years ago. Marti is still in jail in connection with the apparently 
unrelated "Cotton Club" case, facing trial along with two others in the 1983 
execution of Broadway promoter Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said she sought the dismissal after Sheriff's 
Department forensic experts disagreed with LAPD examiner Jimmy L. Trahin, who 
said a .45-caliber revolver sold by Marti was the gun that killed Rene Vega two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas, she and fellow prosecutor David Conn had the weapon 
retested in the Vega case after reading about Rickey Ross, a veteran Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy charged in February with murdering three 
prostitutes in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD arrested Ross after Trahin identified the deputy's semiautomatic 
pistol as the murder weapon. When outside experts were called in, however, they 
found that Trahin had incorrectly analyzed the evidence and that his tests were 
inconclusive. Charges against Ross were dropped in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all take this very, very seriously, and the LAPD takes it very, 
very seriously, and the problem is going to be rectified," Thomas told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth said that the LAPD concurs with the district attorney's 
decision to drop the case against Marti because of a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
As for Trahin's status, Booth said the detective still is assigned to the 
firearms section, but he has not conducted any ballistic tests since the Ross 
case. Meanwhile, Booth said, the LAPD has ordered an audit "to see if there is 
any kind of problem.," 
</P>
<P>
In the Vega case, Marti, a former security guard for Hustler magazine publisher 
Larry Flynt, was connected to the slaying by a witness who told police that 
Marti had been asked to supply the gun used to kill the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Marti's lawyer, Richard S. Hirsch, said Wednesday the primary evidence against 
his client had been the revolver.

MURDER CHARGES DROPPED; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BALLISTICS TEST DISPROVES LAPD LAB RESULTS FOR 2ND TIME 
</P>

<P>
The accused triggerman in the "Cotton Club" trial had murder charges against 
him dropped Wednesday in an unrelated case when Los Angeles Police Department 
ballistics tests linking him to the murder weapon proved inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge David Horwitz dismissed a single count of murder against Alex 
Marti, 29, of Sherman Oaks on a motion made by prosecutors, who argued that new 
ballistics tests undermined their case against Marti. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said Marti had been charged with providing a 
gun to another man who allegedly shot to death reputed drug dealer Rene Vega in 
August, 1987, in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAPD Tests 
</P>
<P>
After the slaying, authorities recovered a .45-caliber handgun that Marti had 
allegedly once sold and that they believed was the murder weapon. Initial 
ballistics tests by the LAPD tied that gun to the Vega slaying, but more recent 
tests showed that the gun was not the murder weapon, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The reputed triggerman, Rod Colombo, and another man who allegedly aided in the 
killing, Scott Ashley, are still being prosecuted for Vega's murder. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this year that the prosecution had asked a judge to 
dismiss murder charges against a defendant because of faulty ballistics tests 
by the LAPD crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Ross, a former Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy, was 
charged with murder in connection with a series of prostitute killings earlier 
this year, but then was released from jail after new tests showed the gun was 
not the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rickey Ross Case Cited 
</P>
<P>
"When we found out about the misanalysis in the Rickey Ross case, we decided to 
have another comparison done" in the Marti case, prosecutor Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Marti had the gun tested at the same lab that ruled out Ross' gun 
and tests performed by the Sheriff's Department lab confirmed that the gun 
could not be positively linked to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to go forward in a case in which I don't think there's enough 
evidence," Thomas said. "This wasn't a Rickey Ross case where we had no other 
evidence, but we had slight other evidence, not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the ballistics evidence, prosecutors relied on statements by a key 
witness in the "Cotton Club" murder case, Lyle Kreutzer, who implicated Marti 
in both killings.

CHIROPRACTOR, COUPLE INDICTED IN KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wealthy Covina chiropractor and his secretary were indicted for their alleged 
roles in the kidnaping for ransom of a dental student in Mexico City in 
mid-June, U.S. Atty. Gary Feess announced Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury indictment charges Rolando Peralta, the chiropractor; 
Socorro Contreras, his secretary, and Rigoberto Herrera, Contreras' boyfriend, 
with one count each of international hostage taking, conspiracy and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that Peralta arranged for the abduction of Maria 
Robleto, 22, from her car on the campus of University Technological School in 
Mexico City on June 15, in order to obtain a ransom from her mother, Indiana 
Robleto, a Maywood dentist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held Hostage 6 Days 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Maria Robleto was held hostage for six days at a 
remote location in Mexico until Peralta's confederates, Contreras and Herrera, 
received $40,000 in ransom money and deeds to a Covina house and a vacant lot 
in Huntington Park. The indictment also charges that Peralta threatened to kill 
Indiana Robleto if she did not pay the required ransom. 
</P>
<P>
Peralta has been held without bail since he was arrested June 22. After a 
lengthy hearing, U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman concluded that "there is 
no bail that will ensure the protection of the witnesses in this case . . . and 
the defendant, in this court's opinion, poses a very definite threat to the 
community." FBI agent Jack Page said at a hearing that Peralta owned several 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Peralta, 51, said he was worth about $2 million. His lawyer 
Tony Brooklier said his client owned three restaurants, 
</P>
<P>
Contreras is also being held without bail, and Herrera is free on $200,000 
bail, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Romantic Involvement 
</P>
<P>
Asked why a wealthy chiropractor and restaurateur would want to kidnap someone, 
Gillam said that Peralta and Indiana Robleto had been romantically involved 
"and they had a bitter falling out." 
</P>
<P>
At the bail hearing, FBI agent Page said Indiana Robleto told him that she and 
Peralta had lived together for 2 1/2 years. He said she also told him that they 
had been involved in civil litigation over the two pieces of property that were 
part of the ransom payment. 
</P>
<P>
At the bail hearing, transcripts of taped phone conversations between Indiana 
Robleto and Contreras, and between Indiana Robleto and Peralta were introduced 
to show that negotiations over the ransom money had taken place and that 
threats were made on Indiana Robleto's life. 
</P>
<P>
Robleto learned that her daughter was kidnaped on the night of June 16 when she 
received an anonymous phone call from Mexico to her apartment in San Dimas 
telling her that Maria had been abducted and to demand the payment of money to 
"Rolando," according to the indictment. Soon thereafter, according to FBI agent 
Page, Indiana Robleto called the FBI and Page began working on the case, 
arranging for her phone calls to be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Demanded 
</P>
<P>
The next day, according to the indictment, Peralta called Robleto and told her 
she should pay him $140,000 and he would attempt to locate her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
During a series of negotiations, it was arranged that she would pay Peralta 
$40,000 and turn over the two deeds, according to the indictment. On June 21, 
Contreras and Herrera met with Robleto at her dental office and took the 
$40,000 ransom money and the deeds to the two properties. Later that day, Maria 
Robleto's captors freed her and put her on a bus bound for Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Gillam said that Peralta and Contreras were arrested the following day, after 
it had been determined that Maria Robleto was safe. She said that Maria 
Robleto, while still enrolled in school in Mexico City, "is having a difficult 
time recovering." 
</P>
<P>
The Times was unable to reach attorneys for any of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
A conviction under the hostage-taking count of the indictment carries a 
possible sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000. The 
extortion count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a 
$250,000 fine.

LOST IN THE HIMALAYAS;

<P>
FAMILY WAITS FOR WORD ON TEACHER IN MISSING PLANE 
</P>

<P>
Nighttime is the worst for Jonas and Judy Sidrys. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the visions come hardest, the haunting images of Jonas' sister, 
Vida, stranded or even dead in the brutal Himalaya Mountains where a Pakistani 
airliner carrying her and 53 others vanished last week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when it's daytime over there, and they're conducting the search," said 
Jonas, a doctor from Santa Monica who, with his wife, anxiously awaits word of 
his sister's status. "That's when you could get a call saying she's dead. It's 
almost impossible to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Search 
</P>
<P>
But despite the fears, the telephone call has yet to come. Vida Sidrys, 35, a 
Santa Monica teacher, remains one of the 54 targets of a massive search in the 
northern mountain ranges of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
She has been missing since the Friday morning, when the twin-engine passenger 
plane that was to carry her from the Himalayan tourism hub of Gilgit to a 
vacation spot in Islamabad, Pakistan, disappeared from radar screens. 
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government immediately launched a search for the aging Pakistan 
International Airlines plane and its passengers, which included five infants, 
but has thus far failed to find any traces. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they have no idea why the plane went down. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have slowed the search parties, which are using two large air force 
planes, helicopters and a small search plane to scan the Himalayan and 
Karakoram ranges. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they are doing what they can," said Judy Sidrys on Wednesday, "but 
it's just so frustrating. It's been six days now, and we still have not heard 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Still, hope persists. 
</P>
<P>
"She might have survived," said Jonas, who lives in an apartment downstairs 
from Vida's. "Vida is very athletic, very healthy. She also has some experience 
in backpacking. She would be able to survive in the outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said her sister-in-law is also an avid cyclist who rode her bicycle to 
Marymont High School, where she teaches Western civilization classes. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't even own a car," Judy said. "She just rode every day, and that's a 
pretty long way from here." 
</P>
<P>
The couple also described Vida as a seasoned globe-trotter. 
</P>
<P>
"She is really interested in exotic places and cultures and she likes to go to 
them," Judy said. "Each summer she plans trips to places like Bali, Nepal or 
India. That's why she wanted to go to Pakistan." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said she last talked to her sister-in-law about two days before she was to 
fly from Los Angeles to Gilgit. 
</P>
<P>
She said the teacher had just returned from visiting family members in Michigan 
and was packing for her vacation overseas as they talked. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really excited about this trip," she said. "At first, she didn't think 
she'd have the money for it, but she came up with it. She couldn't wait to go." 
</P>
<P>
But Jonas was wary of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw her itinerary, I was concerned because there was so much flight 
time, so much time . . . in the air," Jonas said. "She was flying over the 
Himalayas and that's a dangerous part of the world. There was just too much of 
an opportunity for something to go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, something did go wrong. But government officials from both the 
United States and Pakistan have yet to figure out what. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Find Aircraft 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the Pakistani government is just trying to find the plane and hope 
they are alive," said Philip Covington, a spokesman for the U.S. State 
Department. "I don't think they are operating under the premise that anyone is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the terrain is brutal, and it would be difficult to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Although they acknowledge that the Pakistanis are doing all they can to find 
the aircraft, the Sidrys family still wants the hunt intensified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's happening," Paul Sidrys, 26, another of Vida's brothers, 
said from the family home in Streator, Ill. "But it's hard to judge when you 
are halfway around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said her father-in-law has hinted at obtaining a visa to visit Pakistan 
just to be close to the search. 
</P>
<P>
"And a friend of (Vida) offered to go over there and help," she said. "But 
there's not a whole lot more that can be done. We just wish there were." 
</P>
<P>
Jonas said he also voiced his concern to the office of Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles) in an effort to expedite the search. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the family concedes, there is little they can do to bring Vida 
home. They have resigned themselves to spending each day waiting pensively. 
</P>
<P>
And each night in fear.

PRO-CHOICE UNIT TARGETS FOOD OUTLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle over abortion moved Wednesday to a Los Angeles fast-food restaurant 
-- a Carl's Jr. outlet -- where 100 pro-choice picketers protested the 
financial support that the founder of the Orange County-based chain has given 
to anti-abortion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The picketers described the late-afternoon action as part of a national 
strategy to fight back against major funders of anti-abortion organizations, 
including Carl's Jr. founder Carl Karcher and Domino's Pizza magnate Thomas S. 
Monaghan. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards that read, "Keep Abortion Legal" and "Carl Thinks Women Are 
Meat," the picketers marched outside a Carl's Jr. restaurant at Western Avenue 
and Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking money from the very people that they are using the money 
against," said Tammy Bruce, spokeswoman for the Fired Up for Choice abortion 
rights group, which organized the rally. "We have a choice and it is not to 
feed into that." 
</P>
<P>
Motivated in part by a July U.S. Supreme Court decision that opened the way for 
states to limit access to abortion, once largely reactive abortion rights 
groups are intensifying their lobbying efforts and increasingly conducting 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Spillar, national coordinator of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said 
the Carl's Jr. rally "is one of the first. But you'll see this happening more 
often." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters did not disrupt business inside the restaurant but did shout 
slogans and tried to persuade people not to go inside. 
</P>
<P>
One customer, who refused to give her name, said she is pro-choice and, because 
of the protest, will think twice before eating at Carl's Jr. again. But she 
added, "I don't think it's a benefit to them disturbing anyone when they're 
eating." 
</P>
<P>
Spokewomen for Carl's Jr. and Domino's said Wednesday that the boycotts are 
misguided, since donations made to anti-abortion groups have come from 
individual executives rather than from the corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., parent firm of Carl's Jr. restaurants, issued a 
three-paragraph statement Wednesday saying that allegations that "a set part of 
every dollar spent at Carl's Jr. is given to the pro-life movement is simply 
not true." 
</P>
<P>
At most, said Karcher Enterprises spokeswoman Patricia Parks, the firm itself 
has donated several hundred dollars to candidates and organizations associated 
with the anti-abortion movement. In the last five years, she added, no such 
contributions have been made directly by Karcher Enterprises to Operation 
Rescue or other such organizations. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Parks said, "It's true that Mr. Karcher has been very open 
and public regarding his support of the pro-life philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Karcher is not going to change his views, so we expect that the opposition 
against him will continue," she said. " . . . (But) from the company's 
perspective, we believe Mr. Karcher and the company shouldn't be punished for 
exercising his right to freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, anti-abortion groups have waged similar boycotts of 
pharmaceutical firms that market drugs designed to induce abortions.

Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis embodied the brash Wall Street professionals who rose to 
prominence in the 1980s riding takeover mania and the bull market. But like 
Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis B. Levine and a few others who rode this heady wave, 
Lewis' exuberance ultimately led to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 50, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three counts of securities law 
violations, was both a successful deal maker and trader. 
</P>
<P>
He was a preeminent player in the speculative game known as risk arbitrage. His 
firm, S. B. Lewis &amp; Co., speculated on mergers, aggressively buying stock 
in companies that were targets of takeover offers, making profits if the stock 
prices rose further but losing if the deals and stock prices collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a reputation of being a very smart arbitrager," said Frank E. Baxter, 
president and chief executive of Jefferies &amp; Co., a Los Angeles brokerage 
firm that executed trades for Lewis, including the ones involved in his guilty 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Involved in Many Big Deals 
</P>
<P>
But unlike other pure "arbs" such as Boesky who merely speculated on stocks and 
were often seen as an annoyance in corporate boardrooms, Lewis also was a deal 
maker whose counsel was sought by several prominent corporate chieftains. His 
firm collected hefty fees advising corporations on mergers, and he helped 
arrange several. 
</P>
<P>
Most prominently, he helped arrange American Express' 1981 acquisition of 
Shearson Loeb Rhoades, earning his firm a $3.5-million fee and helping speed 
the trend of large financial service firms buying Wall Street brokerages. He 
also helped negotiate American Express' purchase of Investors Diversified 
Services, a Minneapolis financial advisory firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' success was not entirely of his own doing. He undoubtedly was helped by 
the reputation and power of his father, Salim L. (Cy) Lewis, a Wall Street 
legend who turned Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. into an aggressive Wall Street 
trading house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy Stints 
</P>
<P>
After attending the University of Chicago and working for a year as a school 
counselor, the younger Lewis was lured to Wall Street and almost immediately 
began to make his own mark. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, he helped Salomon Bros., then largely a bond trading house, break 
into stock trading. He also served noteworthy stints at Merrill Lynch, Dean 
Witter and other firms, but his intensity and abrasiveness ultimately led to 
his quitting or being fired by several firms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Lewis became a special adviser to Securities and Exchange Commission 
Chairman Harold M. Williams. After leaving the SEC, he worked for a time with 
Boesky before forming his own firm in 1980, aided by a $4-million capital 
infusion from American Express. 
</P>
<P>
Other investors in his fledgling firm included former Treasury Secretary 
William E. Simon, Limited Inc. Chairman Leslie Wexner and two former SEC 
chairmen, Roderick Hills and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
In his arbitrage activities, Lewis is believed to have made huge profits. To be 
successful at arbitrage requires getting good information about the prospects 
that a takeover would be completed, and Lewis was meticulous and aggressive, 
often spending hours on the phone seeking tips or milking sources. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lewis also continued to advise on takeovers -- helping, for example, 
the Limited, a Columbus, Ohio, retailer, acquire the Lane Bryant apparel chain. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his close association with American Express and its chairman, James 
D. Robinson III, that appears to be pivotal in his guilty plea. Whether that 
friendship led Lewis to engage in illegal stock manipulation remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors allege that Lewis bought stock of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 
1986 to drive up the price and thus help American Express sell part of its 
Fireman's Fund stake at a higher profit. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors allege that Lewis requested two unidentified Jefferies 
employees to buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on May 8, 1986, in 
an attempt to drive its price up to $38 a share, substantially above its level 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also allege that Lewis promised to reimburse Jefferies &amp; Co. 
for any losses and that he hid his role through phony records. 
</P>
<P>
One day later, American Express announced that it would sell 8 million shares 
of Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share. It eventually made a profit of $88 million 
from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colleagues Shocked 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' downfall began when Boyd L. Jefferies, founder and former chief of 
Jefferies, pleaded guilty to stock fraud in 1987 and confessed to his own role 
in the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Close friends and colleagues then and now have expressed surprise that Lewis 
engaged in any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be shocked if Sandy did anything illegal," American Express chief 
Robinson said in 1987 when word began leaking out that Lewis was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was on vacation Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. But a 
statement issued Wednesday by American Express, which has not been accused of 
any wrongdoing, called Lewis "a man of integrity and high professional 
competence."

EXXON'S ENVIRONMENTALIST DIRECTOR GETS MIXED REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon Corp. elected a well-regarded marine scientist to its board Wednesday -- 
fulfilling a promise that it would add a director with an environmental 
background -- but the appointment drew mixed reviews from environmental groups 
who had favored a stronger advocate. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Steele, 62, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution in Massachusetts and president of its governing body, was elected 
to a one-year stint on Exxon's board, bringing its total membership to 15. He 
also was named to a new public issues committee formed in the wake of the March 
oil spill in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"My job will be to comment and to advise the board on (environmental) issues 
and on more general aspects," Steele said in an interview. But he rejected 
categorization as an environmental advocate: "I think the term environmentalist 
has too many political implications. . . . I have not been involved in advocacy 
on either side of these issues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Groups Object 
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups objected strongly to Steele's appointment. "We're mad 
as hell," said Brent Blackwelder, vice president of the Friends of the Earth 
and Environmental Policy Institute. "It's an outrage to citizens who had 
expressed concerns about the Exxon oil spill . . . and it's not what we 
understood by the appointment of an environmentalist to the board." 
</P>
<P>
But Exxon spokesman William D. Smith defended Steele's appointment and denied 
the suggestion that Exxon had backed off its earlier promise. 
</P>
<P>
"No one on the board has a particular constituency, and each is expected to 
bring specific experiences to a breadth of issues brought to the board," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others praised the choice. "Dr. Steele is a distinguished professional, a 
world-class environmentalist, head of an institution with a commanding 
international reputation. . . . I don't think anyone can object to this 
appointment," said New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who represents 
several city pension funds with heavy investments in Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's choice had been watched closely in part as a harbinger of future 
corporate appointments. The world's largest public oil company was fulfilling a 
promise made at its May shareholders meeting at the urging of Goldin and with 
the backing of California State Controller Gray Davis, a trustee of two 
California pension funds with large Exxon holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Goldin and Davis subsequently urged six other major oil companies to add a 
director with an environmental background and to create public issues 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
Steele's appointment came as a surprise to those who had expected the naming of 
a more prominent environmental advocate. The Woods Hole laboratory is perhaps 
best known in recent years as the base for researchers who found and explored 
the sunken wreckage of the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Blackwelder, writing on behalf of 14 public interest and environmental 
groups, had sent a letter to Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl nominating former 
Wisconsin governor and one-time Sen. Gaylord Nelson of the Wilderness Society 
for the slot. 
</P>
<P>
He said the environmental groups, representing more than 500,000 individual 
Exxon shareholders, would now oppose Steele's reelection at next year's 
shareholders' meeting and would nominate Nelson instead. 
</P>
<P>
Other names that had emerged as possible board candidates included Jay Hair, 
president of the National Wildlife Federation; Russell E. Train, chairman of 
the World Wildlife Fund, and Alice Rivlin, chair of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background in Mathematics 
</P>
<P>
Other environmentalists were more guarded than Blackwelder about Steele's 
appointment, though most expressed disappointment. "We don't want to prejudge 
him," said Sharon Newsome, a vice president of the National Wildlife 
Federation. "As a director of Woods Hole, he will have an important perspective 
that will be very useful to the Exxon board. . . . The one question we would 
have, and our hope, is that he would also be a good advocate on a broader array 
of environmental issues." 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a lot of confidence that Exxon would appoint someone to their 
board who was going to be a burr under their saddle," added Tim Mahoney, head 
of the Sierra Club's Alaska coalition. "Frankly, I'm not sure whether a strong 
environmental advocate would have been able to do much on the Exxon board, 
except be a gadfly." 
</P>
<P>
Steele, who expects to visit the site of the oil spill in two weeks, said his 
background was in mathematics and that his current expertise was in the 
dynamics of marine ecosystems. Six months ago, he retired from active 
administration of the Woods Hole laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that environmental issues are no longer externalities in the business 
of a large company like Exxon," Steele said. "They must be considered as an 
integral part of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Steele has chaired a committee of the Congressional Office of 
Technology Assessment charged with looking into technical problems of offshore 
oil drilling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, through its educational foundation, has contributed money to Woods Hole 
research, he said. He declined to discuss figures. 
</P>
<P>
Steele was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and he worked for 26 years at the 
Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen, Scotland. He joined Woods Hole in 1977 as 
director. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently a member of the board of the University Corporation for 
Atmospheric Research, the Arctic Research Commission and the National 
Geographic Society's committee for research and exploration.

SINGAPORE RECRUITING CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
ISLAND HOPES TO TAP INTO SOURCE OF ENGINEERS WHO MAY NOT WANT TO GO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Seizing what it views as a golden recruitment opportunity in the aftermath of 
China's military crackdown in June, the government of Singapore is eyeing the 
highly skilled pool of Chinese students in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore faces a shortage of engineers needed by international companies, and 
officials are hoping some of the students may welcome the chance to work in 
Singapore, rather than going home when their student visas expire. 
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Economic Development Board in Los Angeles, which in 1987 began 
recruiting engineering graduates from U.S. schools, conducted a recruitment 
campaign in March that drew about 200 applications, 30 of them from Chinese 
nationals, said K. K. Chan, director of the board's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
After the June bloodshed in China, the board decided to extend a special 
invitation to Chinese nationals who will soon graduate from U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the uncertainties in China, we thought maybe they will be 
interested in working in Singapore," Chan said. "These people who come out 
(from China) are the cream of the country. I would say it's a good target to 
aim at." 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering good salaries relative to Singapore's cost of living, 
Singapore will expedite immigration applications for the professional recruits, 
he said. Seventy-six percent of Singapore residents are of Chinese ancestry, 
and the development board is hoping that will make the country appealing to 
Chinese nationals looking for a familiar culture. 
</P>
<P>
The government also has been actively recruiting in Hong Kong, hoping to 
attract professionals there who may be wary of 1997, when Britain's lease 
expires and the colony is to be returned to China. Although 3.25 million Hong 
Kong residents hold British passports, Britain has denied them the right to 
freely emigrate there. 
</P>
<P>
After Singapore announced in July a program to recruit up to 100,000 Hong Kong 
workers, the response was so great that Hong Kong police had to be called in to 
control unruly crowds of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is home to nearly 700 international companies with manufacturing 
operations and more than 3,200 companies with service operations, creating a 
constant demand for engineering professionals. While the country's two 
universities, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological 
Institute, together graduate close to 1,000 engineers a year, the country still 
must recruit 200 to 300 overseas engineers to meet the demand, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Electrical and mechanical engineers are the most sought after, he said. An 
engineer with a bachelor's degree could expect to be paid about $650 to $900 a 
month while one with a doctorate could receive between $1,500 to $2,000 -- 
salaries that would guarantee extremely comfortable life styles given 
Singapore's cost of living, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
(In Singapore, the average salary for beginning production workers such as 
assemblers and mechanics is $236 a month, according to 1988 statistics from the 
Singapore Ministry of Labor. The average for beginning technicians is $300 a 
month.) 
</P>
<P>
The island republic previously only granted permanent residence to college 
graduates, professionals or business people with capital of at least $500,000. 
It is now recruiting any candidate with a secondary education and five years of 
work experience. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's recent "two is enough" family planning campaign "has been too 
successful," Chan said, explaining why the population growth rate has slowed in 
the country of 2.6 million people. The government is now offering tax benefits 
to couples who have a third child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deadline Over 
</P>
<P>
The government's open invitation to overseas workers is worrying some Singapore 
residents, however, who say the tiny nation is already battling traffic and 
housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the deadline for U.S. students to submit resumes, the board had 
received more than 100 applications from Chinese nationals studying in this 
country, Chan said. The board will forward the resumes to U.S. and 
international companies in Singapore such as Minnesota Mining &amp; 
Manufacturing, IBM, Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T and Motorola, he said. Company 
representatives will make campus visits this fall to interview applicants, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For Chinese nationals whose U.S. visas are about to expire but who fear 
persecution or political uncertainty if they return to their homeland, the 
prospects of permanent residency in a country outside China could be very 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Yong-ping Zeng, a University of Southern California student who will soon 
graduate, would like to stay in the United States when he graduates, but he 
sent a resume to the development board last week to keep his options open. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy getting a job in the United States, he said. "First they require 
you to have a green card, but to get a card you need a job. It's a bad circle." 
</P>
<P>
But Wang Shiqing, a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA who is not job hunting, 
said even if he were, he would not find Singapore attractive as a place to live 
and work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a small place," Wang said.

TOP WALL ST. SPECULATOR PLEADS GUILTY TO 3 COUNTS; 
</P>
<P>
LEWIS ADMITS '86 SCHEME WAS 'WRONG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, for years one of Wall Street's brightest stars, pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to three federal felony counts stemming from a 1986 scheme to 
drive up the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a dazzling deal maker and stock speculator, pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan to a single "margin," or credit, violation; a 
record-keeping infraction and one count of stock manipulation in the May, 1986, 
episode. Prosecutors have alleged that the manipulation was designed to lift 
Fireman's Fund stock just before a public stock offering that might otherwise 
have exposed American Express Co. to heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
American Express owned the Fireman's Fund stock that was offered for sale, as 
well as a stake in Lewis' company. 
</P>
<P>
The counts carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a possible 
fine of up to $2.75 million. Lewis' company, S. B. Lewis &amp; Co., pleaded 
guilty to two felony counts -- a margin violation and keeping false books and 
records. Lewis was indicted last November on 22 counts, a figure that was later 
reduced to 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledged to Reimburse Jefferies 
</P>
<P>
In a 15-minute hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, Lewis 
acknowledged that he had done "wrong" but contended that his intention had been 
only to protect American Express from the harm that might have been done by 
stock traders called "short sellers," who can profit from falling stock prices. 
Lewis, 50, also tried to emphasize the culpability of Boyd L. Jefferies, 
founder of the Los Angeles investment firm Jefferies &amp; Co. and the 
government's prime witness against him. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies pleaded guilty to securities law violations in May, 1987, and has 
since cooperated with prosecutors in building other cases. 
</P>
<P>
Until the practice was recently barred, short sellers have tried to profit from 
stock offerings by driving down the price of the stock before the offering was 
made. The intent was to sell borrowed shares of higher-priced stock before the 
offering, then profit by repaying them with the lower-priced shares available 
in the offering. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he spoke to Jefferies on May 8, 1986, the day before the offering, 
and both of them agreed that something should be done to frustrate the short 
sellers. Lewis acknowledged that he suggested that Jefferies secretly arrange 
to push up the price of the shares by making large purchases of the stock later 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to reimburse Jefferies for any losses he might incur. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis admitted that, under the arrangement, Jefferies gave him 100% credit for 
all the stock Jefferies would purchase. Such an arrangement is a violation of 
margin rules, which limit the amount that investors can borrow. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis acknowledged that he repaid Jefferies by having Jefferies bill another 
firm, R. D. Smith &amp; Co., for $150,000, and then paying Smith a phony 
"advisory fee" of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis contended that it was Jefferies, rather than he, who suggested pushing up 
the price of Fireman's Fund stock by 25 cents a share to $38 by the close of 
the trading session. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors took exception to that contention. Assistant U.S. Atty. Anne C. 
Ryans said prosecutors would present evidence at the sentencing that Lewis did 
suggest the $38 price as a goal and that, contrary to the statement of his 
attorney, Stanley B. Arkin, Lewis did intend that the stock purchases would 
affect the offering price. 
</P>
<P>
American Express, which was not accused of wrongdoing in the episode, said in a 
statement Wednesday that it was "saddened" by the development, adding that it 
had found Lewis to be a man of "integrity and high professional competence." 
The company said it had conducted its own investigation of the manipulation and 
found that none of its employees were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has had a long business relationship with American Express and is 
personally close to several of its officials, including Chief Executive James 
D. Robinson III. Lewis helped arranged American Express' 1981 acquisition of 
the Shearson Loeb Rhoads investment firm, now part of American Express' 
Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which will decide whether Lewis will be 
allowed to return to the securities industry, has so far brought no charges 
against him, according to spokeswoman Mary McCue. Lewis remains a managing 
director of S. B. Lewis &amp; Co., which has continued its normal conduct of 
business since Lewis' indictment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spared One Indignity 
</P>
<P>
Significantly for the Wall Street corruption probe, Lewis' plea agreement does 
not pledge his cooperation with prosecutors in developing cases. The 
government's strategy has been to enlist the help of defendants to track down 
the wrongdoing of others on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his attorney have taken a hard line on the charges since they were 
brought. As other prominent industry figures offered testimonials to Lewis' 
character last fall, Arkin was quoted as calling the indictment "irresponsible 
ruthlessness on the part of the U.S. Attorney's Office." Arkin declined comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The once-powerful arbitrager was spared one indignity. The TV camera crews that 
have thronged around other Wall Street defendants were occupied Wednesday 
waiting for a verdict in the tax evasion trial of hotelier Leona Helmsley, and 
they missed Lewis' departure. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and the defense will meet Sept. 25 to choose a date for the 
sentencing.

Toshiba, IBM Venture Set: Toshiba Corp. and IBM Japan Co. announced that they 
will launch a 50-50 joint venture in November to manufacture large-sized, high 
resolution color liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, mainly for use with 
computers. The two companies said the new firm, Display Technologies Inc., will 
initially be capitalized at $143 million and be headquartered at Toshiba's 
factory in Himeji, 375 miles southwest of Tokyo. The factory, due to start 
operations in April, 1991, will manufacture 10-inch, high-resolution color 
LCD's using thin-film transistor technology jointly developed by the two 
companies.

Two Supercomputer Firms to Merge: In a widely expected move, graphics 
supercomputer makers Ardent Computer Corp. and Stellar Computer Inc. said they 
will merge, linking two competitors that have had a bumpy start in an emerging 
segment of the computer industry. The privately owned companies said they plan 
to complete their merger by the middle of October and will name the new entity 
Stardent Inc. Both companies manufacture powerful graphics-intensive computers 
primarily used by scientists and industrial designers. The value of the merger 
was not reported.

Group Offers $200 Million for Arby's: A group of eight franchisees said it has 
offered more than $200 million in cash to buy the Arby's fast-food chain from 
DWG Corp., the holding company controlled by industrialist Victor Posner. The 
group, calling itself R. B. Partners Ltd., said it made the offer Aug. 1 in a 
letter to Posner, who has so far not responded to the proposal. In a letter to 
fellow franchisees, the group said Posner's legal and financial problems could 
threaten the future of Atlanta-based Arby's. Posner pleaded no contest in 1987 
to federal income tax evasion and was sentenced last year to five years 
probation. DWG, a Miami-based holding company, controls Arby's Inc., the 
marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100-store Arby's 
restaurant chain.

ARCHER PLANS TO LICENSE 'QSOUND' TO NINTENDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archer Communications Inc., a small Canadian firm bent on developing and 
selling a three-dimensional sound technology, said Wednesday that it agreed to 
license its "QSound" system to Nintendo of America Inc., which dominates the 
video game industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement was conditioned on certain undisclosed requirements 
being met in the next 90 days, the news sent Archer's stock up $1.50 in 
over-the-counter trading in the United States, to $19.375 on volume of 270,500 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
The high-flying stock of the Calgary, Alberta, firm has come under scrutiny by 
regulators and the financial press because the company has yet to ship a 
product or record a profit, yet its market value has soared to more than $200 
million. In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission mailed questionnaires 
to some shareholders asking how the company's stock was brought to their 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Archer began courting the Hollywood film and recorded music community two years 
ago, and now counts among its investors the post-production film company of 
Todd A-O, film producer George Folsey Jr. and record producer Jimmy Iovine. 
Late last year, the powerful talent agency, Creative Artists Agency, agreed to 
represent the sound technology in exchange for stock warrants and a percentage 
of the firm's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the company has repeatedly missed its own deadlines to introduce the 
technology to various industries, heightening the suspense about whether it 
would secure an agreement with a video game manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement appeared to allay some, but not all, questions about 
Archer's product for the video game market or the impact on Archer's earnings. 
Neither company would divulge how much Nintendo has agreed to pay in royalties 
or guaranteed minimum payment. Nintendo will invest about $5 million in 
exchange for 294,000 shares of Archer's stock as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Archer President Lawrence G. Ryckman said the royalty on game units may be in 
the "medium price range" of 10 cents to $1.25. He estimated that as many as 50% 
of Nintendo games might use the technology. One industry source said Nintendo 
expects to have 45 million units on the market by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Howard C. Lincoln, senior vice president of Nintendo of America, declined to 
say just how much the technology will cost consumers, who spend about $80 to 
$110 for video game consoles and $25 to $50 on individual video games. But he 
acknowledged that consumers initially must purchase a device to enable them to 
hear the enhanced sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to have concluded this agreement, and if the conditions are 
fulfilled within the 90-day period, we'll have further announcements," Lincoln 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lincoln nor Ryckman would spell out the conditions, but the Archer 
president said they are "not onerous" and are legal in nature, such as proving 
ownership of certain patents. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't (a question of) . . . technology, like 'does it work'," Ryckman said.

MERGING JAPANESE BANKS FACE PROBE

One of two Japanese banks planning a major merger admitted Wednesday that it 
urged clients to buy stock in the bank in June before the negotiations had been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure by Taiyo Kobe Bank has prompted a probe by the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange, although officials said they did not suspect insider trading was 
involved in plans to create the world's second-largest bank, despite large 
share purchases made by a securities firm affiliated with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was intended to increase the number of stable shareholders of the bank's 
stock," said Fukio Yamamoto, spokesman of Taiyo Kobe Bank, which announced 
Tuesday that it would merge with Mitsui Bank next April. "It had no connection 
with the merger talks" going on then, Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Taiyo Kobe has been seen as the main beneficiary of the merger in terms of its 
stock price, which is well below its merging partner. Taiyo Kobe stock had been 
steady at about $9.80 a share until late June, then began rising. It closed at 
$11.40 Monday, the day before the merger was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in both banks' stock was suspended Tuesday to give investors time to 
digest details of the merger. On Wednesday, Taiyo Kobe stock closed at $13.50 
after the maximum one-day gain of $2.10 allowed under exchange rules. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange said they would conduct a "routine-type" 
probe, not based on any suspicion that insider trading or illegality was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Hitoshi Shimakura, head of the Transaction Inspection division of the world's 
largest exchange, said his office would look into recent price fluctuations of 
both stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"The real key is when the actual decision on the merger was made," he said. "As 
far as insider trading laws are concerned, anything that occurred before the 
final decision to merge has to be handled separately." 
</P>
<P>
Kenichi Suematsu, president of Mitsui Bank, said Tuesday that the merger plan 
was formally approved by the boards of both banks Monday. He said negotiations 
for the merger began in March.

ZZZZ BEST CO. INSIDER IS ORDERED TO PAY $900,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a former ZZZZ Best Co. official to 
disgorge profits and pay damages totaling nearly $900,000 stemming from insider 
trading violations while at the now-defunct carpet cleaning firm. 
</P>
<P>
Jack N. Polevoi of Woodland Hills, who pleaded guilty in June to four counts of 
stock and tax fraud and other violations and is serving an 18-month prison 
sentence, was ordered by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher to disgorge 
$224,861 in illegal profits plus interest, and pay triple damages of $674,582. 
</P>
<P>
The action against Polevoi, a former ZZZZ Best vice president, was based on 
findings that in mid-1987 he and his twin brother, Jerry, ordered 54,200 shares 
of the Reseda firm to be sold short. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Polevoi had inside knowledge that company founder and Chairman 
Barry M. Minkow was considering resigning and the firm was "in a state of 
disarray and chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Selling short is a method by which an investor seeks to profit from a decline 
in the stock price, by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later. ZZZZ 
Best shares fell from more than $5 each at the time the short sales were made 
to 75 cents when Polevoi completed the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Polevoi and others also laundered $712,000 in ZZZZ Best corporate funds and 
bank loans through Las Vegas casinos in the days before the firm collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty, while large, is dwarfed by the $26 million in illegal profits and 
restitution charges levied against Minkow. He was found guilty on 57 counts of 
fraud, conspiracy and other violations, and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

AUSTRALIAN PILOTS STRIKE RUINING TOURISM

Australia's tourist industry, starved of domestic airline services for the past 
week, is facing ruin because of widespread cancellations by nervous overseas 
visitors, operators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts and hotels reported a slump in occupancy rates since the weekend, when 
travelers realized that the dispute, which has grounded all domestic airlines 
since last Thursday, was set to continue for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's bleeding here at the moment," said Gaynor Cooper, marketing 
manager of the Yulara Resort in the shadow of Ayers Rock in the central 
Australian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect to be 100% full at this time of year, but our occupancy rate 
is very low. People are canceling because they are afraid they won't be able to 
get back home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Australia's most important foreign exchange earner and reaped $4.9 
billion from about 2.2 million visitors in the last financial year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had quite massive cancellations from abroad. There's been a huge loss of 
confidence," said Owen French, manager of a string of island resorts off 
Queensland. "Overseas travel agents are just taking Australia out of the 
schedules." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
About 1,600 pilots resigned en masse last week after the three largest domestic 
airlines refused to consider their demand for a 30% pay raise, bringing chaos 
to the transport system of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said they had received more than 800 responses from pilots to job 
advertisements they placed in newspapers around the world. But they warned it 
would take about four weeks for the applications to be processed and new pilots 
to be trained. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few charter flights still serve tourist hot spots such as Ayers 
Rock, most foreign travelers come to Australia on multi-stop tickets, which are 
no longer feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly got worse since yesterday, and we're now around 20% to 30% down 
on normal," said Yvonne Singleton, public relations manager at Sydney's Menzies 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of cancellations of groups, mainly Japanese, for 
September." she added.

BOYFRIEND OF SLAIN WOMAN FREED AFTER LAB TESTS SHOW HIM INNOCENT 
</P>

The boyfriend of Denise Marie Duerr was cleared of murder charges Wednesday 
after laboratory and lie detector tests demonstrated he was not involved in the 
brutal stabbing death of the 21-year-old Garden Grove woman, a Riverside County 
deputy district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clyde Spontak, 22, of Garden Grove, was released late Wednesday from 
Riverside County Jail, where he had been held since April. 
</P>
<P>
Spontak, who emerged from the jail about 8:20 p.m. wearing a purple sweat shirt 
and neon green shorts, said he was happy to be free and that he had spent many 
hours thinking about Duerr. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a nightmare, I could never have had such a bad dream," said 
Spontak, who had wept before television cameras as he proclaimed his innocence 
in the days following Duerr's death. 
</P>
<P>
Spontak, who said he plans to return to Orange County and seek work, added, 
"I'd spend the rest of my life in jail if I could get her back." 
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, his attorney, Thomas Brown of Westminster, said, "It's been a 
long haul. . . . He (Spontak) really is very concerned that the person who did 
this be punished." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators now believe Cameron Charles Seaholm, 22, a high school classmate 
of the couple who also was charged in Duerr's murder, is responsible for the 
crime, Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C. Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm is accused of stabbing Duerr about 20 times with an ice pick, wrapping 
her body in a sheet, putting her in the trunk of her car and dumping her in the 
hills near Corona, Lough said. Seaholm remains in custody in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm, a drifter who sometimes stayed in the apartment shared by Duerr and 
Spontak, told police he stole Duerr's 1984 Fiero while high on cocaine and 
discovered her body in the trunk after the car got a flat tire. Seaholm 
admitted to dumping the victim's partially decomposed body, but insisted he was 
not involved in her slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Proctor, Seaholm's lawyer in Santa Ana, did not return calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's developments in the case provided little comfort to the Duerr 
family, some of whom expressed doubts about Spontak's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know," said Ronald Ducharme, Duerr's stepfather. "It doesn't 
bring the kid back." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duerr, Denise Duerr's uncle and manager of the electronics store where 
she had worked, said he is taking a "wait-and-see" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's guilty of nothing else, he's guilty of having Denise in that 
environment that caused the whole thing," Duerr said of Spontak. "I don't plan 
on having any contact with him at all." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "that environment" was responsible for the delay in dropping charges 
against Spontak, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially believed that arguments between Duerr and Spontak over his 
suspected drug dealing led to her death. Spontak had lied to authorities about 
his whereabouts at the time of Duerr's death, leading to his arrest, Lough 
said. Investigators also linked Spontak to the crime because Duerr is believed 
to have been killed in the garage of the apartment shared by the couple. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe (Riverside County Sheriff's deputies) had probable cause to arrest 
him and I still believe that," Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
But after a few months in jail, Spontak provided investigators with another 
account that was verified by neighbors and other acquaintances, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us chapter and verse and explained why he had lied to us," said Lough, 
who declined to provide details of Spontak's subsequent account except to say 
that investigators were able to confirm his information. 
</P>
<P>
Spontak "wasn't in a position to explain his whereabouts because of his other 
criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm told investigators that he and Spontak had planned to sell about a 
half-pound of cocaine about the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown agreed that if his client "had gotten his story straight in the 
beginning, I don't think he would have been taken into custody." 
</P>
<P>
Spontak also passed a lie detector test, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never act upon that independently. . . . But it did contribute to" the 
charges bring dropped, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators were working to verify Spontak's new account, laboratory 
tests were under way on bloodstained sheets and other physical evidence from 
the crime. The tests revealed the presence of body fluids other than Spontak's 
on Duerr's body. 
</P>
<P>
A pretrial hearing for Seaholm, who has pleaded innocent, is scheduled for 
Sept. 25.

MARINE NCO, WIFE CHARGED WITH STEROID SALE ON BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Marine sergeant and his wife were indicted Wednesday in San Diego County on 
federal charges of running a steroid distribution center out of their home at 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-count grand jury indictment, Gunnery Sgt. Matthew J. Sigloch, 37, and 
his wife, Rene M. Sigloch, were accused of conspiring to distribute and sell 
anabolic steroids with an estimated street value of as much as $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that the couple sold their wares from a "menu" of 
available steroids, offered samples and even gave special rates for bulk sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday by San Diego U. S. Atty. William Braniff, 
Sigloch is accused of distributing the illegal body-building chemicals from his 
office at the air station and using an office telephone to negotiate thousands 
of dollars in sales. The couple allegedly stored the steroids at their home on 
Hannibal Street inside the base. 
</P>
<P>
Sigloch is assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 46, which performs aircraft 
maintenance. His wife is also employed on the military base, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Jim McLain, an air station spokesman, said Wednesday evening that the base 
had not heard about the indictment or the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the gunnery sergeant solicited steroid sales of as 
much as $100,000 -- bearing an estimated street value of $400,000. The 
indictment also charges the couple with arranging the steroids to be smuggled 
into the United States from across the Mexican border, at times transporting 
shipments through express mail. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of the male hormone testosterone, 
which stimulates the buildup of muscles' mass tissue and protein in the body. 
They are illegal without a doctor's prescription because they can cause damage 
to the liver. The steroids cannot be legally imported and brought into the 
United States, Braniff said, so the drugs are often smuggled over the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials have said in the past that Orange County is 
considered a prime area for steroid use because of the high concentration of 
health clubs and the abundance of money.

SAN DIEGO FREEWAY WILL GET MAJOR CAR-POOL LINK TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 14-mile, southbound car-pool lane on the San Diego Freeway between the 
Corona del Mar (California 73) and San Gabriel River (Interstate 605) freeways 
will open today, Caltrans officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound car-pool lane, which has been opened in stages since last 
December, will now extend the same distance. 
</P>
<P>
The lanes on the San Diego Freeway are expected to surpass those on the Costa 
Mesa Freeway (California 55) as the most heavily used in California, in part 
because regularly scheduled bus service is planned. Only a few charter buses 
and vans now supplement automobile and truck traffic in the car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, county transportation officials hope to link existing car-pool 
lanes and special busways into a 250-mile, countywide network involving 
virtually every Orange County freeway and three planned tollways. 
</P>
<P>
All of the car-pool lanes are reserved for vehicles carrying a driver and one 
or more passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Fines for violating this rule, and for crossing into and out of the special 
lanes at other than designated entrances and exits, range from $246 for the 
first offense up to $613.50. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda described today's lane opening as an 
opportunity for motorists to gain a "round-trip express ticket in a reserved, 
uncongested freeway lane." 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the car-pool lanes from the Corona del Mar Freeway to the 
juncture of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine is expected next 
summer.

SEARCH FOR LOST MARINE FLIERS FINDS FRUSTRATION 
</P>

LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No movement could be seen on the baking desert sand Wednesday except for the 
hulking shadows of two U.S. Marine helicopters, gliding in tandem like giant 
green insects a scant 200 feet aloft. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, the Tustin-based helicopters scoured a 500-square-mile area just 
north of Lake Havasu, searching in vain for any sign of a lost Marine 
observation plane and its two-man crew. The OV-10A Bronco, based at Camp 
Pendleton, vanished without a trace last Thursday while on a routine practice 
flight over the Southern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I say UFOs kidnaped 'em," Capt. Mike Griggs, co-pilot of one of the 
helicopters, said in exasperation as he maneuvered his olive-green CH-46 Sea 
Knight back toward the Marine Corps Air Station at Tustin following Wednesday's 
search, which yielded no fresh clues. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what happened to the twin-engine Bronco, so far, is a mystery 
to Marine Corps officials. 
</P>
<P>
They know only that pilot Sergio Vivaldi, 29, of Port Chester, N.Y., and his 
observer, 1st Lt. Joel Piehl, of Bismarck, N.D., departed Camp Pendleton at 
11:30 a.m. last Thursday on what was to be a three-hour reconnaissance flight. 
The plane never returned. The crew made no radio contact. Air-traffic-control 
radar was unable to track them. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 150 planes have spent more than 800 hours scouring every nook 
and cranny over 324,000 square miles of Southern California desert between the 
Mexican border and Nevada. They also have checked witnesses' reports of black 
smoke, possibly from a plane, seen billowing in the towering mountains above 
Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
But, as of Wednesday, the Marines were no closer to finding the plane -- which 
did not carry an emergency transmitter as most civilian planes do -- than they 
were when the search first started. 
</P>
<P>
"Your guess is as good as mine," Maj. Gen. Royal Moore Jr., commander of the 
3rd Marine Air Wing based at El Toro, said in a briefing before more search 
efforts continued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although military aircraft disappear from time to time while on practice 
flights, Marine officials say that most are located within a matter of days, if 
not hours. With the OV-10A Bronco now missing for so long, Moore said the 
disappearance has few precedents. He also said the Marines may be forced to 
call off the search if something is not turned up soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep this up forever," the general said, adding that neither he nor 
any of the other Marines involved in the search want to give up. "Our real 
concern is that we're leaving somebody in the battlefield. We have two Marines 
that we can't find." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said, however, that there was little more new ground to search. Marine 
officials, working out of a command post at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, already had divided the Southern California desert into 
30-mile-by-30-mile quadrants, then arranged for individual military planes and 
helicopters to canvass each tract. 
</P>
<P>
This was done, first, by other OV-10 Bronco planes, which flew from north to 
south at altitudes of 500 feet, beginning at the Arizona border and working 
back, Moore said. The planes were followed by teams of slower-flying 
helicopters, assigned to cruise from west to east at 200 feet, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marked the completion of the search through all the quadrants. The 
two remaining quadrants -- located on both the California and Arizona sides of 
the border north of Lake Havasu City -- were scoured by six Tustin-based 
helicopters, flying in formations of two. 
</P>
<P>
With that task completed, Moore said he intends to concentrate the search on 
the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountain ranges near Palm Springs. Military 
planes, assisted by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol, already have been 
looking without success throughout those mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Marine officials say it appears increasingly likely that the plane crashed and 
the crew members either did not survive or were seriously injured. That 
speculation is based on the fact that there have been no distress signals 
picked up from the pocket-held emergency beepers that all Marine airmen are 
required to wear in the event they go down. Moore said signals from the beepers 
can be detected 150 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The task, then, has been to find where the plane may have crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with this area is it is extremely rough (terrain)," Moore said. "I 
could lose probably 100 OV-10s in there." 
</P>
<P>
Flying over the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains while en route to the 
search area Wednesday, Maj. J.V. (Ace) McLain, public affairs director for the 
3rd Wing, peered from his helicopter at brush-choked canyons and ravines below. 
Neither he nor three other crew members aboard could pick out anything of 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like looking for a needle in a haystack; only we don't even know where 
the haystack is," McLain said. 
</P>
<P>
While it seemed unlikely that the missing plane had veered as far east as the 
Arizona border -- more than 200 miles away from Camp Pendleton and at the outer 
limits of the Bronco's three-hour flying range -- the helicopter crews left no 
stone unturned in a grueling, six-hour search. Although the two target areas 
were distinguished as "Echo" and "Zulu" by the Marines, the stark, sun-baked 
terrain looked much the same. 
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters piloted by Maj. Stan Wells and Maj. Mike 
Minnehan were responsible for the far northern part of the "Echo" quadrant, 
stretching from Needles on the south to Laughlin, Nev., on the north and 30 
miles west from the Colorado River. Wells' crew, riding in "Knightrider 50," 
included co-pilot Griggs and the crew chief, Cpl. Paul Romano. Minnehan's crew, 
riding in "Knightrider 53," included the co-pilot, Capt. Mike Griggs, and crew 
chief, Cpl. Todd Hanna. The helicopters flew in formation -- five rotor-lengths 
apart -- at speeds of about 65 m.p.h over flat desert lake beds dotted with 
sagebrush and pocked by washes. At slower speeds, they followed the contour of 
jagged mountain ranges. The helicopters cleared some peaks by a margin of less 
than 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is pretty, and fun to fly in," Griggs remarked to Wells as their 
helicopter glided precariously close up an Arizona mountainside studded with 
saguaro cacti. 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines weren't here on a sightseeing trip and they never let the 
purpose of their mission get far from mind. 
</P>
<P>
With so much terrain to scan, the search grew monotonous. The quadrants were 
examined by the helicopters flying first in one direction, then in another and 
another until their area was completed. It took a total of seven "passes," for 
instance, to clear the "Echo" sector. For the Marines wearing stifling flying 
suits, the search was also made more grueling by 109-degree temperatures, for 
which the only relief came in two refueling breaks at the air-conditioned 
airport at Lake Havasu City. 
</P>
<P>
But even in their discomfort, the Marines were reluctant to call off the search 
as daylight waned. 
</P>
<P>
"These (missing airmen) are our brothers in arms," McLain said. "They would 
have done the same for us."

<P>
FIRE RAISES FEARS OF ARSONIST'S RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A home was ransacked and then set afire in a posh Newport Beach neighborhood 
Wednesday, raising fears that an arsonist responsible for a series of blazes in 
the area has begun again after a three-month hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished a blaze at 1815 Port Westbourne Place that caused 
$15,000 in damages and killed a family poodle, said city Fire Capt. Ray 
Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The home is in the Harbor View Hills neighborhood where there have been at 
least a dozen suspicious fires in the last year, ranging from trash can 
bonfires to residential blazes. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's blaze -- the first of suspicious origin since May -- marked what 
seems to be the return of the arsonist, Police Lt. Tim Newman said. The house 
had been ransacked before the arsonist set a room on fire, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong possibility that this particular fire is related to the 
others," Newman said. "We haven't had one in quite a while, but the fact that 
it is an arson and it is in this neighborhood shows that it might be the same 
person." 
</P>
<P>
The fire had been set shortly before 11:40 a.m. in a room in the back of the 
house, Pendleton said. A neighbor, who noticed smoke billowing from the room, 
called firefighters, who extinguished the blaze in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Since July 15, 1988, three neighborhood homes and four cars have been set on 
fire, and there have been numerous trash can blazes. No injuries have been 
reported, police said.

KRISHNAS DID NOT BRAINWASH CYPRESS GIRL, COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a long-awaited ruling on religious liberty, a state appeals court dismissed 
a claim that the Hare Krishna sect brainwashed a 15-year-old Cypress girl and 
cut by more than two-thirds a $9.7-million verdict against the group. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the brainwashing claim, the 4th District Court of Appeal in San 
Diego dismissed claims that the Krishnas intentionally caused Robin George 
emotional distress and libeled her. It left her only a $75,000 award tied to 
the wrongful death of her father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freedom of Religion at Issue 
</P>
<P>
However, the court left intact a $2.9-million judgment for Robin's mother, 
Marcia George, for emotional distress and libel. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated case began in 1977 when the George family sued the sect, 
contending that the group had brainwashed Robin into joining the movement, then 
hid her from her parents. The complex lawsuit included claims of libel and 
wrongful death, the latter because stress allegedly brought on the heart attack 
that killed Robin George's father in 1976. In 1983, an Orange County jury 
returned a $32.5-million verdict against the sect, a judgment cut to $9.7 
million by the trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
In their appeal, the Krishnas contended that the verdict interfered with their 
constitutional right to freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on both sides said Wednesday that appeals of the most recent, 
105-page decision are almost certain because neither side can be considered a 
complete winner. 
</P>
<P>
Robin George "got clobbered," said Lynde Selden, a San Diego attorney 
representing the Georges. "And, if anybody was wronged by this Krishna 
behavior, it was Robin. I think her mother agrees. Robin was injured the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
Now 29 and known by her married name, Robin George Westerkamp, the interior 
designer who lives in Orange County called Wednesday's ruling "sad." 
</P>
<P>
The court apparently didn't understand the "element of mind control and how 
that interferes with your thinking," she said. "The court is looking at this 
case and saying, 'This girl did these things and had a choice -- there must be 
something wrong with her.' 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't gone through this myself, if I was Joe Average or something, I 
would probably think I didn't deserve anything. But it's not that simple. 
(It's) not like joining the Baptist church. It's a totally different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia George was out of the state Wednesday, her daughter said. She could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Krishnas, including about 35 who had walked to San Diego from San 
Francisco en route to Tijuana to publicize the case, gathered Wednesday 
afternoon at Horton Plaza downtown to celebrate what they called "a victory for 
religious freedom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Court Was Wise' 
</P>
<P>
"The court was really very wise on that brainwashing fiasco," said Mukunda 
Goswami, a spokesman, noting that the $9.7-million award would have forced the 
Krishnas to sell six temples -- in San Diego, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach, 
Brooklyn, New Orleans and outside New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to recommend that we take it to the (state) Supreme Court, if for 
no other reason than we don't think the evidence will sustain any of those 
causes of action as to the old lady," said W. Marshall Morgan, the Los Angeles 
attorney who represented the Krishnas, formally known as the International 
Society for Krishna Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Niddrie, the San Diego lawyer who handled the appeal for the Georges, 
said he had read only parts of the opinion, but said it "troubles me in that it 
gives these types of organizations the opportunity to . . . mistreat their own 
members as long as it doesn't sort of adversely affect the interest of people 
on the outside. I don't think that's the state of the law in California." 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the latest turn in a case that began when Robin George, then a 
15-year-old Cypress teen-ager, ran away from home in November, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
She spent most of the next year in Krishna temples in New Orleans and Ottawa, 
Canada. The following November, she ran away from the Krishnas and returned 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1976, less than four months after she returned home, her father, 
James George, died of a heart attack. The stress caused by his dealings with 
the Krishnas and his inability to locate his daughter for the year she was gone 
"significantly shortened his life," an expert testified at trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Month Trial 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1977, Marcia and Robin George sued the Krishnas in Orange County 
Superior Court, contending that the sect brainwashed Robin and then conspired 
to hide her from her parents. After a five-month trial, a jury returned the 
$32.5-million verdict. Judge James A. Jackman reduced the amount to $9.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego attorney Milton Silverman represented the Georges at trial, but did 
not take part in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The "centerpiece" of the appeal, according to Justice Howard Wiener, who wrote 
the lengthy opinion, was the brainwashing claim. The Georges contended that 
Robin had been brainwashed and could not leave the temples even if she wanted 
to. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1988 ruling from the state Supreme Court -- in a case involving 
the Unification Church -- Robin needed to show that the Krishnas physically 
restrained her from leaving, which they did not, Wiener said.

MYSTERY WOMAN SOUGHT;

<P>
POISONED CAKE SPOILS A PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are looking for a woman who delivered a poison-laced chocolate cake to a 
retirement party for a county's sanitation supervisor last week, causing nine 
people to become ill. 
</P>
<P>
The cake, with chocolate icing and a "Happy Retirement" inscription, was 
dropped off before work hours at the offices of the Orange County Sanitation 
Districts at 10844 Ellis Ave. in Fountain Valley last Thursday, said Fountain 
Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold. The delivery person, a young woman, gave the 
cake to a worker and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The worker then brought the cake to the desk of retiring supervisor William 
Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a bonus since we were going to have a bigger cake later in the 
day," said Clarke, 60. "I figured, 'Well, let's eat it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Within two hours, Clarke and seven others had diarrhea, nausea and headaches. 
No employees were hospitalized, although one sought medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I only took a few bites when I realized it had some chemical in it," said 
Randy Harris, a maintenance foreman. "It had a bitter taste to it." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman, described as white, standing 5 feet, 2 inches and in her 
mid-20s with brown hair, drove away in a dark-colored Ford Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet what tainted the cake, pieces of which were taken to the 
Orange County Health Care Agency for analysis, Griswold said. Police say the 
woman was attempting to poison the employees, although they don't know why or 
who she is. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I probably made some enemies," said Clarke, a 29-year employee 
who retired as superintendent of operations and maintenance at the sewage 
treatment plant. "If I found out who did it, I'll be screaming mad." 
</P>
<P>
Some employees said they thought the cake contained a laxative, because 
reactions were quick. But that doesn't explain the other symptoms, said Blake 
Anderson, director of technical services at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still not sure if this was intentional," he said. "But it's rather 
suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who supervised about 300 people, said he had no idea who brought the 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
"It disturbs me that someone did this," said Clarke, of Buena Park. "I thought 
of myself as a good boss." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ooten, who had some of the cake, said Clarke was a "likable" supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said his 24-hour illness taught him "to find out where food comes from 
before I eat it." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke figured the baker eventually will be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, someone will brag about it," he said.

LURE OF LAGUNA IS SUBJECT OF SUIT;

HOMEOWNERS ALLEGE FRAUD

<P>
George and Yolanda Davis always loved Laguna Beach. For 30 years, they came 
down from San Mateo, Calif., each summer for a vacation on its balmy, breezy 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
And when it came time for George to retire from his job as a restaurant supply 
salesman last year, the Davises thought they had found the ideal spot: a 
two-story, three-bedroom home off El Toro Road which, according to the sales 
brochures, signs and documents, appeared to be in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Or so they thought. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Laguna Audubon tract home the Davises bought for $233,900 
is not in the city of Laguna Beach at all. Instead, it is in the planned 
community of Aliso Viejo, across the street from an apartment and town home 
complex that is in Laguna Beach. And the Davises are hopping mad. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, they and the owners of about 140 other homes filed a lawsuit in 
Orange County Superior Court against the Kathryn G. Thompson Development Co., 
the general partner of Laguna Audubon, and other companies involved in the home 
sales. The homeowners allege that Thompson and the other companies -- the 
Saddleback Escrow Co. and Martin Advertising Agency -- fraudulently misled them 
into buying houses they believed were in the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Scott Karlin, who is handling the case for the Laguna Audubon 
homeowners, said they are asking for $5 million in compensatory damages and 
unspecified punitive damages. "We're asking for the difference between the 
value of a property in Laguna Beach versus Laguna Hills," Karlin said. "The 
estimates range from $30,000 to $100,000 per house." 
</P>
<P>
The Kathryn G. Thompson Development Co. referred calls about the lawsuit to its 
attorney, Angelo Palmieri, who declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Martin of Martin Advertising, which handled the advertising for the Laguna 
Audubon project, also declined to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises, and other homeowners who are suing the developers, had plenty to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract of sale says 'Laguna Beach,' " said Estella Chaidez, a neighbor 
of the Davises, holding the document in question as proof. She paid $213,900 
for her house on Hummingbird Lane. "If it says 'Laguna Beach,' I expect to live 
in Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners point to brochures, business cards given to them by the 
development's sales agents, floor plans and billboards that appear to suggest 
that Laguna Audubon is part of Laguna Beach. One billboard -- it has since been 
removed -- virtually screamed at motorists that the address was "LAGUNA BEACH." 
Sales brochures described the project as in "the Laguna Beach area" or in "the 
coastal highlands of Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Laguna Audubon homeowners moved in, they were sent license plate 
frames that said "Laguna Beach" across the top and "Laguna Audubon" at the 
bottom. And just before they moved, the sales agents gave them a list of useful 
phone numbers, including the numbers for Laguna Beach police and fire 
departments -- neither of which serves the development. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally found out we didn't live in Laguna Beach when a neighbor took his 
dog to get registered at the city pound," said George Davis. "They told him he 
didn't live in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The development is in the 92656 ZIP code, which for about a year did have a 
Laguna Beach mailing address, according to Laguna Beach postal Supt. William J. 
Aspinwall. About a year ago, the Mission Viejo Co., which is the major 
developer of the Aliso Viejo planned community, got Aliso Viejo recognized in 
the National ZIP Code directory. 
</P>

For Davis and other homeowners, though, the matter is more important than an 
address on an envelope.

"Aliso Viejo -- what's that, a subdivision of Tijuana?" Davis said. "I thought 
we were buying in Laguna Beach. . . . Let's face it, I wouldn't have moved here 
if we had known."

SUNNY HILLS MIGHT BE TEAM TO RUN PAST LA HABRA FOR A CHANGE 
</P>

<P>
Traditionally, predicting the winner of the Freeway League has been easy. 
</P>
<P>
The six-team league has been dominated by La Habra High School, which has won 
five titles in the past six years. The streak was interrupted in 1987 when La 
Habra's undefeated team forfeited two games for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, there is an overwhelming favorite in 1989, but this time that team 
should be Sunny Hills. Even Jack Nicholls, La Habra's coach, admits as much. 
</P>
<P>
"The big reason we won the title last year was beating Sunny Hills in our 
league opener," Nicholls said. "I feel strongly that if we want to repeat, 
we're going to have to beat them again." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra upset Sunny Hills, 14-0, last season, shutting out a team that 
averaged 24 points in its other nine regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big, big win," Nicholls said. 
</P>
<P>
Shutting out Sunny Hills this time around would be quite an accomplishment. The 
Lancers figure to have one of the best running games in Orange County with 
three talented running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pizula, who averaged 9.1 yards per carry as a junior, is among the top 
backs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Overby is a strong, slashing-style runner who will start at fullback. But 
the most impressive back is speedster Mike Sullivan, who gained 1,200 yards on 
the Lancers' sophomore team last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, the school's junior class president, was ineligible to play for the 
varsity last year after transferring from Servite. 
</P>
<P>
"All three have power, speed and the God-given ability to run to daylight," 
Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said. "This is by far the best group of running 
backs I've coached." 
</P>
<P>
They will have the benefit of running behind three all-league offensive linemen 
-- center Robert Sung, guard Darren Correll and tackle Pat Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the most talent and the most experienced coaching staff," said Rick 
Foley, Buena Park's coach. "That's a pretty tough combination to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Devaney, who had been downplaying his team during the preseason, finally 
admitted this could be his best team in 10 seasons at Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"A team rarely goes through this league undefeated, but Sunny Hills could do it 
this year," said John Turek, Troy's coach. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
BUENA PARK -- Six victories in four seasons leaves little room for optimism, 
but third-year Coach Rick Foley is confident his team will end the longest 
league losing streak (27) in the county sometime in '89. "Our goal is to make 
the playoffs, and for the first time in my six years here, we're not picked to 
finish last," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Foley had two full-time assistant coaches and seven walk-on coaches 
on his staff. This year, he has seven full-time coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes have one of the biggest offensive lines in the county, anchored by 
tackles Jason James (6-5, 295) and Jim Perricone (6-5, 255). They also have two 
of the county's quickest players: all-league cornerback Malcolm King and wide 
receiver Charles White. 
</P>
<P>
Foley thinks the program turned around last year, when the sophomore team tied 
Sunny Hills for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Medellin and tailback Chris Medina, who led the sophomores to 
a 9-1 record last year, are among the top newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON -- The Indians were the surprise of the Division VI playoffs last 
year, advancing to the semifinals by upsetting La Mirada and Kennedy. 
Quarterback Rene Arias returns for his third season after completing 34 of 75 
passes for 589 yards and 6 touchdowns and rushing for 211 yards and three 
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Arias was seldom 100% last year in Fullerton's triple option; he suffered a 
hyper-extended elbow in the team's second game and never fully recovered. "In 
our offense, Rene is going to get hit on almost every play," said Steve 
Nishimoto, Fullerton's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Marcus Roberson, the backup to Steve DePhillips the past two years, 
finally gets his chance. "Our offense is quarterback-fullback oriented, so 
Marcus figures to carry about 20 times a game," Nishimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Patel, who started at cornerback last year, will move to wide receiver. 
He caught only three passes last year, but averaged 36 yards per catch. D.C. 
Olsen, a 215-pound junior, is the biggest player on the team and will double at 
linebacker and either guard or center. 
</P>
<P>
Nishimoto lost his most versatile player when wide receiver-defensive back John 
Bailey quit the team after spring football to concentrate on baseball. Bailey 
was the county's 13th leading scorer as a junior, serving as the team's punter 
and field goal kicker. He also caught seven touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
LA HABRA -- The Highlanders, who have won more league titles in the past six 
seasons than any other county school, opened with three straight losses last 
season. But they rebounded to go 4-0-1 in league play, allowing an average of 
six points per game. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to win ballgames with our defense," Nicholls said. "I go by that old 
Marijon Ancich philosophy that defense wins ballgames. Most of our kids like 
playing defense better than offense, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Highlanders' offense should be strong with five returners, plus a 
quarterback (Mark Moreno) who started five games. Halfback Mark Brown, who 
scored 11 touchdowns as a junior, is stronger and faster as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate Mark carrying the ball or receiving it about 25 times a game," 
Nicholls said. "He's as good as anybody in the North County." 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Jeff Besinaiz, the best hitter on the team, doubles at linebacker. 
Three offensive linemen -- Chad Pitcher (center), Dan Lediff (guard) and Herman 
Hernandez (tackle) -- also return. 
</P>
<P>
SONORA -- Two Division I-linebacker prospects, Scott Tibbets and Scott Sanders, 
head a 32-player squad under second-year Coach Larry Allen. "All we need is 
about nine more players just like them," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora's only victory in 1988 was over Buena Park, 14-6. In the past four 
years, the Raiders have a 13-28-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting a losing attitude," Allen said. "We've had five coaches here 
this decade, so there's little sense of continuity and no tradition. We've had 
problems getting kids to come out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Lewis, a wide receiver last year, has moved to quarterback. He improved 
over the summer and beat out David Stack for the starting spot. Stack will 
start in the defensive secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbets, an all-league selection, also plays fullback and was the team's 
second-leading scorer as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can compete with the La Habras and Fullertons, but Sunny Hills is 
another story," Allen said. "They're the cream of the crop in this league." 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS -- The only question mark is at quarterback, where unproven junior 
Rick Orr outplayed La Mirada transfer Jamal McKenzie to earn the starting job. 
Orr is an adequate passer at best and probably will throw less than 12 times 
per game because he has several fine backs. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs visited Sunny Hills last spring to scout Correll, a 
strong lineman whose quickness defies his 245 pounds. Correll also will play 
linebacker. "Defensively, we're smaller than we've been in the past, but we're 
much quicker," Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
How deep is Sunny Hills' backfield? David Wilde, a star running back on the 
Lancers' sophomore team two years ago, has been moved to wide receiver to get 
some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills will make a six-day trip to Edmonton to play LaZerte High on Sept. 
22. The trip, three years in the making, will cost each player $400. 
</P>
<P>
TROY -- The Warriors are the youngest team in the league with only 15 seniors 
on their 39-player roster. Coach John Turek will be counting heavily on players 
from a sophomore team that finished 5-4-1 and has only one player, Jeff Dorsz 
(6-5, 250), with good size. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a team with so many question marks," Turek said. "We could be 
pretty good, or we could be pretty bad. We could score some points, but we're 
also going to give up some points." 
</P>
<P>
Troy has only two returning starters, captains Bill Preisler and Adam Petecki. 
Preisler will double as a defensive end and offensive guard and Petecki doubles 
at linebacker and center. 
</P>
<P>
Another part-time starter, fullback Chad Brasington, joins tailback Ed 
Gunderson and quarterback Greg Windle in the backfield. Windle is a 
dropback-style left-hander who Turek said is "very accurate." Gunderson has the 
potential to become the best back Turek has coached at Troy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some good skilled-position players, but for the first time since 
I've been here, we don't have the physical size up front on either line," Turek 
said.

RUNNING: WINNING A RACE OF DETAILS, DETAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putting on a road race used to be such a simple matter. Toss up a start/finish 
line. Ready, set, go. 
</P>
<P>
How times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like planning a huge wedding every week of the year," said Herb Massinger 
of Race Pace Promotions in Dana Point. "It's that planning and taking care of 
all those tiny details, day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
Said George Guibert of Elite Racing, which has offices in Costa Mesa and San 
Diego: "It's a very intense, emotional, involving thing. . . . You become the 
event." 
</P>
<P>
Massinger, 33, and Guibert, 38, have organized races throughout the county for 
the past five years. They've seen the events develop from low-key neighborhood 
affairs to more elaborate productions with big-name runners, corporate 
sponsors, prize money -- and lots of details. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Race Pace, which has put on such races as the Bastille Day 8K and 
the Mid Summer Night's Dream 12K, and Elite Racing (San Clemente Fiesta 5,000, 
Carlsbad 5,000), organize the majority of road races each year in the county. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to continue -- if it doesn't drive them crazy first. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to know what is going on every minute; you've got to be on your 
toes," Guibert said. "It's like a war game." 
</P>
<P>
Massinger and Guibert have witnessed a few too many races -- including one or 
two of their own -- where something unexpected ruined the whole event. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, about a year before he became involved with race production, Massinger 
ran in the San Francisco Marathon. There he learned his greatest lesson: Always 
make sure you have your portable toilets delivered on time. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 10,000 runners in Golden Gate Park without one toilet," he said. 
"There was no backup facilities. The race director was at Safeway at 6 in the 
morning trying to buy every roll of toilet paper in the store. . . . The race 
people just stood on a stage, throwing rolls of toilet paper at the people 
below." 
</P>
<P>
Guibert's biggest nightmare came during the Carlsbad 5,000. The 3.1-mile course 
crossed a set of railroad tracks twice during the race. Before the race 
started, an oncoming train was to be radioed to stop before reaching town. 
</P>
<P>
But because of a mix-up in communication, the race started early. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden we heard, 'On your mark, get set, go!' " said Guibert, who was 
about 50 yards ahead of the start in the lead vehicle. "It was like in a 
Western when you see a runaway herd coming your way. There was no way we could 
stop them." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the train was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all facets of race production are this exciting. According to 
Massinger and Guibert, most runners who plunk down $15 to run a race and then 
complain have little idea of all the work that goes behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's such a complex event, most people don't see the scope of work the 
job involves," Massinger said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical day? 
</P>
<P>
"You might be at a 7 a.m. meeting to meet Caltrans because that's the only time 
you can talk to them," Massinger said. "Then from 8-9 you're in bicycle pants 
riding around measuring the course. Then at 10, you're in a suit at a business 
meeting with a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"At 11, you get a call from the city and find out they just tore up a sewer 
line and you'll have to design a new course. Then you turn around and someone 
tells you we just lost a thousand race entries in the mail . . . It goes on and 
on and on." 
</P>
<P>
The work starts months before race day. Among the items on the agenda: 
establishing and training a corps of volunteers to help on race day, securing 
permits, renting parking space for race entrants, putting together advertising 
and promotions, designing T-shirts and race brochures, mailing entry forms and 
reserving equipment such as sound systems, waste containers, tables, chairs, 
canopies, radios or walkie-talkies, generators . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
According to Guibert, cost for an average event is $25,000 and up. Many cities 
require a $1-million insurance policy. T-shirts cost the race director $3.50 to 
$4 each. A morning's worth of traffic control by city police is about $7,000. 
Then there's the cost of banners, trophies, ribbons, and, if offered, 
appearance fees and prize money for the elite athletes. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the race director is paid as a consultant to the charity 
that benefits from race proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fee might be $5,000 for a race, though that might mean you'll work a year 
for it," Massigner said. "We try to establish a management fee based on the 
scope of the work we think we'll be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Massinger added that Race Pace is also working toward incentive bonuses, 
meaning that if his event raises more money for the charity than originally 
expected, Race Pace would earn a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios Coming to OC? According to Guibert, Arturo Barrios of Mexico, who set 
the 10,000-meter world record-holder last week, is planning to come to Santa 
Ana Nov. 26 for a race appropriately called the Arturo Barrios Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios, who set the 10,000 record in 27 minutes 8 seconds last week, is 
competing in Europe, but his wife, Joy Rochester, said her husband is very 
interested in doing the race because it will benefit Latino education in Orange 
County. Barrios, a resident of Boulder, Colo., received a degree in mechanical 
engineering from Texas A&amp;M and is working toward a master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Arturo wants to be a positive influence in academics as much or more so as in 
athletics," Rochester said. "He wants to do a race to benefit a scholarship 
fund possibly for Hispanics growing up in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Guibert said Elite Racing would like to organize the race much like the 
Carlsbad 5,000, where many elite runners would be invited to compete for a cash 
purse of at least $20,000. A "peoples' race" also will be offered, Guibert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cheese of Irvine was the first county finisher at the Mule Run Ultra 50K in 
Bishop last weekend. Cheese, who coaches the Corona del Mar High School's 
girls' cross-country team, finished third overall in 4 hours 6 minutes. Fred 
Shufflebarger, the overall winner in 1986 from Laguna Beach, was fifth in 4:11 
and Earl Towner of Laguna Beach was seventh (4:19). Renee Ortego of San 
Clemente was the first county woman to finish in 5:29. Laura Knebel of Trabuco 
Canyon was 104th overall in 6:00:33. Finland's Jussi Hamalainen won the race in 
3:53:49 . . . The first meeting of the Orange County Cross-Country Coaches 
Assn. is scheduled for Sept. 13 at 7 p.m. at the Coors Hospitality Room in 
Anaheim. . . . PattiSue Plumer has compiled enough points that she only has to 
finish the 3,000-meter race at Monte Carlo this weekend to win the women's 
3,000-meter title of the Mobil Grand Prix Series. Plumer, who was featured on 
this month's cover of Track &amp; Field News, will win $10,000 for having 
compiled the most points through the 1989 Grand Prix meets.

EX-O.C. BANK HEAD, 2 ALLEGED MOB FIGURES ACCUSED OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Orange County bank president and two alleged associates of a Los 
Angeles organized crime family have been indicted by a federal grand jury for 
wire fraud and conspiracy, the U.S. attorney's office announced Wednesday in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments, which stemmed from two separate investigations, were issued in 
October, 1987. But they were kept under seal until Aug. 24 and not disclosed 
until Wednesday because of another investigation that was recently concluded, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted in the first case Wednesday were Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, former 
President of Far Western Bank in Tustin, and Morton Goodman, 53, of West Hills, 
an alleged Los Angeles organized crime family associate, according to the 
announcement by U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis was charged with 18 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy 
to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 5 in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that McGinnis, while president of Far Western in 1984, 
supplied casinos in Las Vegas with fraudulent credit information, allowing 
Goodman and his associates to obtain large credit lines for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman is being held on $250,000 bail pending his arraignment in Los Angeles, 
also scheduled for Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement follows a lengthy investigation and other indictments. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, John DeMattia, 52, a reputed mob associate of Goodman, pleaded 
guilty to wire fraud in the alleged scheme to arrange for gambling credit at 
the Las Vegas casinos by inflating bank account records at Far Western. At the 
time, prosecutors said DeMattia had the help of an unnamed bank official. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal prosecutor Richard Stavin said last April that Far Western 
provided financial references for clients of several casinos, including the Las 
Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
DeMattia also pleaded guilty in April, 1988, to extortion in another case 
involving several organized crime figures in Los Angeles. He is still serving 
his three-year sentence in Lompoc federal prison, according to Steve Nielsen, 
one of the two Los Angeles Police Department organized crime investigators who 
worked on the case. 
</P>
<P>
William A. Dougherty, a Villa Park attorney representing McGinnis, said he was 
surprised by Wednesday's announcement. "The matter has been pending for over 
five years" he said. "We've cooperated, given hand-writing samples. All of a 
sudden we get an unsealed indictment. We're planning to plead not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty also asserted that all the bank accounts that McGinnis had vouched 
for "were good. They didn't put kited checks in the account." McGinnis faces a 
maximum of 100 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Goodman nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Goodman faces a 
maximum of 25 years if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis is no longer with Far Western. The institution is a small bank with an 
unusual niche in the industry. After McGinnis left, the bank grew 17-fold 
between 1986 and 1988 by purchasing auto loans made by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In the second indictment announced Wednesday, stemming from a separate 
investigation, Feess said that Rocco Toce, 46, of Marina del Rey, also an 
alleged associate in Los Angeles organized crime, was arrested by the Los 
Angeles Police Department on Aug. 24 after being charged in a federal 
indictment with making false statements on a loan application and with 
conspiracy. This case also stems from a 1987 sealed indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The charges involve activities at Sunwest Bank in Tustin, where Donald 
Hinrichsen, a former bank vice president, allegedly accepted bribes in return 
for granting unsecured loans to several reputed mob figures, including DeMattia 
and Toce. A trial has been scheduled for Oct. 31.

REGULATORS SETTLE LAST CASE IN COLLAPSE OF BUTTERFIELD SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators, acknowledging a lack of evidence, have agreed to settle the 
last piece of litigation accusing defendants of conspiring to defraud 
Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana and contributing to its collapse 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative settlement, reached Monday, would bring the government's total 
compensation in two lawsuits it had filed to about $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The bailout of Butterfield, which regulators declared insolvent and seized in 
August, 1985, cost the federal government $281 million. That's the amount of 
federal assistance pledged in the sale of Butterfield last September to Downey 
Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, which operates a now healthy Butterfield 
as a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year of the S&amp;L's failure, regulators filed two civil lawsuits 
against 19 defendants alleging they conspired to defraud Butterfield through a 
series of about 50 real estate transactions in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In one suit, regulators claimed that Donald W. Endresen, Butterfield's former 
president and chief executive, and other directors and officers conspired to 
increase the S&amp;L's sagging net worth by inflating the value of the 
properties. That suit was finally settled earlier this year when the 
defendants' insurer agreed to pay about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the second suit, regulators accused 13 Oregon brokers, appraisers and 
companies of conspiring with Endresen and S&amp;L officials to pay inflated 
prices -- a total of $85 million -- for the Pacific Northwest properties, 
mostly in Portland. The properties were worth less than $50 million, regulators 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators previously settled with nine Oregon defendants, receiving a total of 
about $500,000, lawyers said. Monday's tentative settlement with three brokers 
and an appraiser would bring the government an additional $1 million. The U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles is expected to approve the last settlement within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
None of the defendants in either lawsuit admitted any liability in settling the 
cases. In an unusual twist, two of the remaining Oregon defendants will receive 
letters explaining that there was insufficient evidence for the government to 
bring fraud and conspiracy claims against them. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery process "did not supply as much evidence as we had originally 
believed of fraud or conspiracy to defraud," said Peter Diedrich, a Los Angeles 
lawyer representing the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The last defendants are brokers Michael J. Safley, R. Michael Van and Thomas V. 
Clarey, and Portland, Ore., appraiser Alan A. Paget. The brokers were doing 
business as Riverside Realty in 1984 when the alleged damages were incurred. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement calls for the federal government to receive $1 million from the 
defendants' insurance company. In return, Safley and Van will be provided a 
letter explaining the lack of evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Folawn, who represents Safley and Van, the bulk of the 
settlement will come from Paget's insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Paget was named in the lawsuit because the government claims that some of his 
appraisals were inadequate. They allege he used faulty economic data, incorrect 
zoning and invalid professional standards in arriving at property values.

UEBERROTH, TALBOT TO BUY HAWAIIAN AIRLINES PARENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advancing a step in their proposed acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, Peter V. 
Ueberroth and Newport Beach developer J. Thomas Talbot have signed a definitive 
agreement to buy the airliner's parent company, HAL Inc., for $22 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The investment group headed by Ueberroth and Talbot is offering to buy all the 
stock of HAL Inc. but needs 51% to complete the transaction. That simple 
majority -- nearly 1.25 million shares -- would cost $27.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
HAL Chairman John H. Magoon Jr., who owns 56.9% of the company's stock, has 
agreed to tender 1.1 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The definitive agreement, already approved by HAL's directors, is subject to 
approval by government agencies, the company's shareholders and the airline's 
unions. HAL has scheduled a stockholders meeting for Oct. 19 to obtain the 
required shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest inter-island airline, also serves Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Anchorage, Las Vegas, Australia, New Zealand, 
Guam and other South Pacific islands.

CHINESE UPHEAVAL MAY BENEFIT ENGINEER-HUNGRY SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seizing what it views as a golden recruitment opportunity in the aftermath of 
China's military crackdown in June, the government of Singapore is eyeing the 
highly skilled pool of Chinese students in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore faces a shortage of engineers needed by international companies, and 
officials are hoping some of the students may welcome the chance to work in 
Singapore, rather than going home when their student visas expire. 
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Economic Development Board in Los Angeles, which in 1987 began 
recruiting engineering graduates from U.S. schools, conducted a recruitment 
campaign in March that drew about 200 applications, 30 of them from Chinese 
nationals, said K. K. Chan, director of the board's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
After the June bloodshed in China, the board decided to extend a special 
invitation to Chinese nationals who will soon graduate from U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the uncertainties in China, we thought maybe they will be 
interested in working in Singapore," Chan said. "These people who come out 
(from China) are the cream of the country. I would say it's a good target to 
aim at." 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering good salaries relative to Singapore's cost of living, 
Singapore will expedite immigration applications for the professional recruits, 
he said. Seventy-six percent of Singapore residents are of Chinese ancestry, 
and the development board is hoping that fact will make the country appealing 
to Chinese nationals looking for a familiar culture. 
</P>
<P>
The government also has been actively recruiting in Hong Kong, hoping to 
attract professionals there who may be wary of 1997, when Britain's lease 
expires and the colony is to be returned to China. Although 3.25 million Hong 
Kong residents hold British passports, Britain has denied them the right to 
freely immigrate there. 
</P>
<P>
After Singapore announced in July a program to recruit up to 100,000 Hong Kong 
workers, the response was so great that Hong Kong police had to be called in to 
control unruly crowds of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is home to nearly 700 international companies with manufacturing 
operations and more than 3,200 companies with service operations, creating a 
constant demand for engineering professionals. While the country's two 
universities, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological 
Institute, together graduate close to 1,000 engineers a year, the country still 
must recruit 200 to 300 overseas engineers to meet the demand, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical and mechanical engineers are the most sought after, he said. An 
engineer with a bachelor's degree could expect to be paid about $650 to $900 a 
month while one with a doctorate could receive between $1,500 to $2,000 -- 
salaries that would guarantee extremely comfortable life styles given 
Singapore's cost of living, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
(In Singapore, the average salary for beginning production workers such as 
assemblers and mechanics is $236 a month, according to 1988 statistics from the 
Singapore Ministry of Labor. The average for beginning technicians is $300 a 
month.) 
</P>
<P>
The island republic previously only granted permanent residence to college 
graduates, professionals or business people with capital of at least $500,000. 
It is now recruiting any candidate with a secondary education and five years of 
work experience. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's recent "two is enough" family planning campaign "has been too 
successful," Chan said, explaining why the population growth rate has slowed in 
the country of 2.6 million people. The government is now offering tax benefits 
to couples who have a third child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Chinese nationals whose U.S. visas are about to expire but who fear 
persecution or political uncertainty if they return to their homeland, the 
prospects of permanent residency in a country outside China could be very 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Yong-ping Zeng, a University of Southern California student who will soon 
graduate, would like to stay in the United States when he graduates, but he 
sent a resume to the development board last week to keep his options open. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy getting a job in the United States, he said. "First they require 
you to have a green card, but to get a card you need a job. It's a bad circle." 
</P>
<P>
But Wang Shiqing, a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA who is not job hunting, 
said even if he were, he would not find Singapore attractive as a place to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a small place," Wang said of the country that's about one-fifth the 
size of Rhode Island.

HIGH STRESS INUNDATES HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. LEIGHTY, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fast-paced world of computer technology is leading to stresses and strains, 
and even defections from a pressure-cooker environment that psychologists say 
will get worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
In an industry that prides itself on having "user friendly" chips, circuitry 
and communications gear that is always getting speedier, smaller and smarter, 
there is a frequent breakdown of a most valuable resource -- its people. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California's hectic Silicon Valley area of Santa Clara County, 
there's a new buzzword -- balance -- that comes from an innovative but vague 
concept called stress management. 
</P>
<P>
Balance, says Jean Hollands, a psychotherapist and director of Growth and 
Leadership Consultants in Mountain View, simply means gaining an equilibrium 
between work and leisure, mind and body. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to let employees know they can balance their jobs and home life; that 
it's all right to go to Little League and so on," Hollands says. "Companies 
aren't practicing it, but they're beginning to talk about it. It doesn't mean 
that it's all right if there's a major project." 
</P>
<P>
Hollands, whose clients include some 150 Silicon Valley firms, says those 
working in the high-tech industry, from keyboard operators to hardware 
engineers, generally encounter more stress than the average person and exhibit 
more mental and physical symptoms as a result. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Source Is Attitudinal 
</P>
<P>
She sees the main source of stress to be attitudinal, and, for relief, she 
relies on a training program that teaches basic communications -- or how to 
relate to others -- for people lost in the nanosecond culture of machines and 
linear thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications skills are necessary," Hollands says. "People with built-up 
stress don't even realize it until they've had a heart attack, stroke or 
ulcer." 
</P>
<P>
Even physical exercise, she says, is often a manifestation of stress for 
overachievers. Instead of jogging, for example, they are attracted to such 
ultra-endurance events as triathlons. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is the most conscientious group of human beings in any one 
geographical location on earth," Hollands says. "If there was a test for 
perfectionism, this group would pass with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
"People down here don't know how to play. They work at play." 
</P>
<P>
An expert in relationships and author of a marital-survival guide, "The Silicon 
Syndrome," Hollands says the soaring divorce rate once prevalent in the valley 
has slowed down and is nearly at the national average today. However, she says 
the stresses haven't decreased, and may even be greater because of the 
financial pressures of living in the expensive region and the percentage of 
families with both partners working. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are in the forefront here of acknowledging that changing partners 
doesn't always fix a stressful situation. The disease AIDS has also created a 
sexual depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Relief Valve' 
</P>
<P>
"People are not sexually acting out anymore, so they have to stay with what's 
at home. They're attempting to make their marriages work here in the valley, 
and I think in the United States, and that adds to stress -- there's no relief 
valve of reaching out to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Stress on the job isn't always bad. A little stress can make the adrenaline 
flow, give spark to creativity and edge the psyche toward peak performance. On 
the negative side, stress can lead to a variety of illnesses, the use of drugs 
or alcohol or even total mental or physical breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
But in Silicon Valley, Hollands says, heavy drinking is often shunned by the 
health-conscious young urban professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcoholism isn't a popular sport here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In a study by the National Center for Health Statistics, more than half of some 
40,000 workers surveyed reported feeling "moderate" or "a lot" of stress. The 
insurance industry estimates the cost to business of stress-related problems 
and mental illness at $150 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Brauer of the Brauer Medical Center in Palo Alto says there is a wide 
variety of stress-related ailments, both physical and mental, that he treats 
with biofeedback, massage, hypnotism, acupuncture and electro-therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"Silicon Valley is a real hotbed for stress-related problems -- the great 
masquerader in medicine today," says Brauer, an assistant clinical professor in 
the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures in the technological terrain, he says, included earning top pay 
because of the area's extremely high standard of living. Competition in product 
development is also deadly, leading to long hours on the job with resulting 
strains on relationships and family life. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a competitive element in the valley of needing and wanting to get 
ahead faster," Brauer says. "There is this 'Alice in Wonderland' sense that no 
matter what you do there is so much more you can do and that is possible. 
They're creating change that is new and exciting -- and rapid change 
automatically creates stress." 
</P>
<P>
When people don't adapt to stress, he says, their system simply overloads, 
resulting in such physical symptoms as headaches, high blood pressure, ulcers, 
heart disorders, asthma, allergic reactions and digestive problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost any problem a person would seek medical attention for could be 
stress-related," Brauer says. "There are emotional problems as well that may 
not be recognized as relating directly to stress, such as depression, phobias 
and sleep disorders." 
</P>
<P>
At the clinic, he says, people are given a complete examination and every 
possible physical cause for the problem is looked at to determine if there is a 
treatable medical condition present. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us the confidence to go ahead and look at the ways we can influence 
the imbalance that has occurred in the body. We look at a person's energy 
systems, their thinking style, the way they eat and how they handle time and 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
After pinpointing stressful areas that need changing, Brauer uses combinations 
of techniques to accomplish the goal. In one treatment called 
"electro-relaxation," two sensors are attached to the earlobes and electronic 
signals are relayed to the brain to stimulate the production of endorphins, 
which are the body's natural sedative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture Used at Times 
</P>
<P>
Combined with hypnosis and other relaxation methods, Brauer says, the brain and 
body become integrated and balanced, resulting in a calmer, healthier person. 
</P>
<P>
Oftentimes, he adds, a purely physical approach is taken, such as acupuncture 
for acute headaches. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent stress, Brauer says, people should take breaks on the job and do 
simple exercises, take a walk or even jog. People at computer terminals, he 
says, can learn mini-relaxation processes that only take a minute or two to do 
but can be extremely helpful in relieving unneeded stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Some stress allows a lot of creative work and productive activity to occur. 
It's not entirely negative, but it's a question of balance," Brauer says. "You 
can function more efficiently if you take a break from it." 
</P>
<P>
Brauer says the machines he uses at the clinic, such as a galvanic skin 
response unit -- a fancy lie detector -- are appreciated in Silicon Valley by 
people accustomed to relating more to technology than to their cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
"They are intrinsically comfortable and respectful of the process. Of course 
that's not true everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Brauer says big companies, especially with soaring health insurance costs, 
should take the forefront in evaluating areas of stress and in using 
intervention programs as a form of preventive medicine before their best 
workers get sick or burn out. 
</P>
<P>
Or quit? 
</P>
<P>
Oakland psychologist Craig Brod says the demanding pace and stress, which most 
companies go out of their way to ignore, is causing a massive defection or 
"brain drain" from the nation's high-tech zones. 
</P>
<P>
To stem this migration of discontent, Brod says he has tried without success to 
interest computer companies into funding a study of stress and technology 
similar to those being done in Japan, Scandinavia and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Problem Avoided 
</P>
<P>
Although some companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, Apple, AT&amp;T and Safeway, 
have programs to encourage employees to wind down and exercise with spas, 
laughter clinics and "beer busts," Brod says the broad problem is avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old story; the vendors didn't want any association with the word 
stress. There's a great big denial going on. They could implement technology 
more effectively, but instead they're repeating a proverbial ill." 
</P>
<P>
DEALING WITH STRESS 
</P>
<P>
Here are some symptoms of stress and ways that people can cope with pressures 
as suggested by psychologists and the American Institute of Stress. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs of stress: 
</P>
<P>
Headaches, irritability, unexplained and frequent illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Nervousness, rapid pulse, increased use of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Insomnia, high blood pressure, loss of concentration, persistent fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Tips for dealing with stress: 
</P>
<P>

Relaxation technique 
</P>
<P>
For people working at computer terminals, Dr. Alan Brauer of the Brauer Medical 
Center in Palo Alto suggests a simple two-minute exercise done three times a 
day to help relax tensions and stress: 
</P>
<P>
* Sit in a chair, feet flat on the floor, hands resting at the side, neck 
slumped forward, eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
* Count down from 22 to zero, visualizing each number and concentrating on the 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrate on the cool air being breathed in and the warm air being exhaled as 
each number is counted. If distracted, return to the last number that was 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
* "Visualizing each number is a neutral phenomenon. It's a way of assisting the 
mind to go into neutral and allows natural relaxation reflexes to occur."

NEW SEAL BEACH COMPLEX OFFERS CHEAP SEATS FOR 2ND-RUN FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Land hadn't been to the movies in a couple of years. The 75-year-old 
Garden Grove resident enjoys films, but he and his wife Grace just "don't have 
the habit," as he put it earlier this week. Land thinks that's about to change. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because of Super Saver Cinemas 7, a seven-theater complex that opened last 
Friday in Seal Beach, charging $1.50 for "any movie, any time." 
</P>
<P>
True, the movies there aren't quite first run (tickets in first-run theaters 
usually cost around $6.50), but they're not golden oldies, either. The Super 
Saver chain -- which is based in Texas and which enters the California market 
with its Seal Beach complex -- offers movies that have left the premiere 
circuit but usually have yet to hit the video stores. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of theaters nationwide are selling cheap seats for second-run 
films. Thirty percent of the 150 AMC Theaters in Southern California show 
movies for less than $2, according to a company spokesman. Century City Center 
theaters in Orange, owned by the San Francisco-based Syufy Enterprises chain, 
shows double features for $1. 
</P>
<P>
But Super Saver officials, who have opened eight other discount theaters around 
the country since 1987, say they offer something different: "a first-class 
presentation" with "deluxe" decor. Ads tout the Seal Beach outlet as "Southern 
California's most luxurious theater." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to go back to the fun and flavor of mass entertainment, which was 
the original concept of the motion-picture business," said Jim McKenna, 
director of theater operations for FSA Super Saver Cinemas No. 1 Ltd., based in 
El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the movie audience has dropped by the wayside because of high prices 
or because the theaters' decor wasn't what they wanted. We're trying to recover 
that audience by giving them both: a first-class presentation and admission 
they can afford." 
</P>
<P>
The AMC Orange Mall Six theater in Orange offers decor ordinaire, as does the 
Century City in Orange: clean and neat and inconspicuous, with simple lighting 
fixtures, concession stands and flooring. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Saver in Seal Beach, modeled after the chain's other theaters, looks 
-- and sounds -- like a disco. Flashing lights and neon tubes, programmed to 
pulse to pop music, throw colored beams throughout the darkened, 
3,000-square-foot lobby where they bounce off reflective walls. Fog 
periodically streams from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn, candy and soft drinks are sold for standard or lower-than-average 
prices from a circular counter made of illuminated glass brick. One enters the 
theaters via a dimly lit "Magic Tunnel of Lights," which one customer likened 
to the entrance to Disneyland's Space Mountain ride. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said Super Saver spent about $750,000 to refurbish the building, a 
former furniture store in the rear of the Rossmoor Center, a large outdoor 
shopping mall on Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The seven theaters -- three with Dolby stereo -- range from 175 to 325 seats. 
The largest screen is 31 feet wide and 14 feet high. (The biggest screen at the 
Edwards Newport Cinema, flagship of Orange County's largest theater chain, is 
75 by 38 feet.) 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 people attended during the complex's first weekend, McKenna 
said. One evening this week, the theaters ranged from about half to an eighth 
full. About 40 people milled about the lobby, and all who were interviewed gave 
the place thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's spectacular -- it's just like a light show," Land said, straining to be 
heard over the thump-thump of an old Michael Jackson hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's excellent," said Dan Gilbert of Seal Beach. "Instead of renting a 
movie, you can come here. The seats are comfortable, the sound is good, the 
picture is clear and the screen is of sufficient size." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Zamost of Long Beach, who brought three of his children, said he likes it 
because he now can afford "to bring these kids to movies I normally wouldn't 
want to see." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna wouldn't discuss company profits but did say that all Super Savers 
around the country are successful. Other new theaters are scheduled to open at 
Indian Hills Mall in Pomona by Feb. 1 and at the Norwalk Plaza shopping center 
by spring. 
</P>
<P>
Super Saver is able to negotiate relatively low rents for its theaters because 
they generate a lot of foot traffic for adjacent retailers, McKenna said. Also, 
renting second-run movies generally enables the company to save about 30% on 
the original rental cost. 
</P>
<P>
Several Hollywood film studios charge that discount houses rob ticket sales 
from first-run theaters where the studios make most of their profits, and one 
-- Paramount Pictures -- recently increased the amount it charges second-run 
theaters: The new rate is $1.05 or 35%, whichever is higher, for each adult 
ticket sold. Paramount spends millions of dollars producing and distributing 
its films and has the right to a fair return on its rentals, a studio 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna insists that discount theater sales don't hurt studios' profits. 
"Paramount's summer business is indicative to us that that isn't true," he 
said. (This summer, the spokeswoman said, Paramount grossed $250 million -- 
slightly more than last year.) In any case, he no longer rents Paramount 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Super Saver in Seal Beach is now showing "Karate Kid III," "K-9," "Who Framed 
Roger Rabbit," "UHF," "Rainman," "Weekend at Bernies," "Licence to Kill" and 
"Ghostbusters II." Screenings begin at noon. The last one starts at 9:55 p.m. 
Films will run from one to 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rainman" was released on videocassette Wednesday, but the movie won't 
necessarily be pulled from the theater, McKenna said. Often films available on 
video have an even stronger draw at Super Savers, he said, because videos can 
cost more than admission. Other Super Saver officials point to the advantage of 
not having to return the video and the risk of a late fee. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Saver company was founded by Bob Garner, who played football for a 
short time with the then-Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers. Garner is 
managing general partner of the limited partnership, which hopes to triple in 
size by the end of 1990, McKenna said. Other Super Saver theaters are in 
Oklahoma, Colorado, Arizona and Ohio.

AT LAGUNA HILLS SEMINARS, INTERIOR DESIGNER KEEPS CROWDS IN STITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN, Pamela Marin is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theoretically, the lecture would be an hour long, the subject interior 
decorating and the audience attentive, note-taking, cowed. That was the plan, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
What came to pass was a two-hour jam session of shoptalk, gossip and one-liners 
-- a comedy routine by turns cocky and flirtatious that elicited wide-eyed 
adulation from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the personal magnetism of Mario Buatta, a.k.a. The Prince of Chintz. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Buatta came to town to deliver a seminar for local interior 
decorators at Design Center South in Laguna Hills. Even before he arrived -- 
after spending a weekend in Morocco at the birthday party of one of his 
clients, Malcolm Forbes -- Buatta's high-profile name doubled the expected 
number of attendees, so a second lecture was added to the program. In all, 
nearly 500 designers -- including dozens from outside the county and one from 
as far away as Telluride, Colo. -- paid $10 each to hear Buatta's talk. 
</P>
<P>
By the look of the crowd pressing around him after each session, it was clear 
His Highness pleased the masses mightily. 
</P>
<P>
Buatta is known for popularizing the English "country" look, replete with 
antiques, bushels of fresh flowers and acres of chintz. On this occasion, he 
jump-started his lectures in an Italian accent thick as pizza dough. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone take-a this course before? No? Good! OK, when I was-a little-a boy, my 
mama say, 'Piccolo Mario, what-a you gonna be when you grow up?' " 
</P>
<P>
In faux broken-English, a machine-gun stutter, Buatta laid out the 
possibilities, as his mama saw them: actor ("because-a you such a showoff"), 
psychiatrist ("because-a you crazy") or lawyer ("because-a you talk-a so 
much"). He said he chose interior design because it would allow him to be all 
of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"Any questions? Any answers?" Buatta asked, shifting to his normal cadences. 
"OK, who's here today? All designers? So we can talk about clients, right? Tell 
all the deep, dark, secrets! Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the first "secrets" to emerge was that the man who grew up to design 
rooms filled with elaborate fine furnishings -- rooms cushioned and draped in 
floral-patterned fabrics and accented with period bric-a-brac -- grew up in an 
altogether different aesthetic environment. Interiors surrounding the child 
Mario were stark, modern and, as he saw it even then, cold and impersonal. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I grew up in a house that looked a lot like this room," Buatta said, 
gesturing to the white-walled conference room. "In my mom's house, you couldn't 
walk on the carpet because you might leave footprints," he said. "You couldn't 
touch the table, because you might leave fingerprints. You couldn't sit on the 
couch because you might leave fanny prints. One day I said, 'Mom, why do we 
live like this?' She said, 'We're expecting guests.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he spoke of his family home in Staten Island with humor, it made a 
lasting imprint on Buatta's outlook toward interior design. Clutter and mess 
and personality are what make a house a home, he told his audience. Or, as he 
put it later, "your house should be a scrapbook of your life." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after his lectures, Buatta rhapsodized about Southern 
California in general and Orange County in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the physical look here," he said. "I love the look of the ocean and the 
line of the land along the shore. I loved (Orange County) from the first time I 
saw it 20 years ago, when it was just miles and miles of desert." 
</P>
<P>
Of current styles and trends, he said he thought the newly-rich-in-the-'80s 
folks have mostly missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of rooms that are self-conscious looking," he said. "I see a lot of 
rooms that are filled with very expensive furnishings and all these other very 
expensive things just thrown together, and none of it has any character or 
history or personality. So much new money -- they just don't get the point of 
what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
During his lectures, Buatta showed a slide of an 18th-Century Sheraton writing 
box, which he described as "my first antique." 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of his own apartments through the years gave way to slides of clients' 
homes and finally to the rooms he restored in the Blair House, the White House 
guest quarters. Buatta and East Coast society designer Mark Hampton were 
jointly commissioned for the restoration, which is nearing completion now and 
which earned the two designers a cover of Architectural Digest magazine earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
For the note-takers in the crowd, there were tips on such matters as lining 
curtains with merino wool, whether drapes can both "puddle" and "traverse" 
(yes), and how to preserve the pattern on delicate blue-and-white Chinese 
export porcelain (don't dust it too often). 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, the two seminars were brief encounters with an extroverted designer 
at the top of his field who calls his work, simply, "one American's point of 
view on English decorating." 
</P>
<P>
Any questions? Any answers?

LIFE ON WHEELS: TRAFFIC CAN TURN OUR LIVES INTO LATE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 12:45 by the time I slid into my seat at the noon luncheon. My silk 
jacket had an embarrassing diagonal crease across the front, an imprint of the 
seat belt that had pressed against it for the past hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Any place else, my hostess may well have been miffed at my tardiness. But this 
is Orange County, so instead, she was sympathetic. So were the others seated at 
my table. 
</P>
<P>
"The 55?" asked the woman seated on my left. 
</P>
<P>
I nodded. She understood. 
</P>
<P>
As I unfolded my napkin and picked up my fork for a few belated bites of salad, 
I explained the details -- not that I really needed to. 
</P>
<P>
After spending more than 45 minutes trapped between the Katella Avenue and 
Chapman Avenue exits, I finally saw what the holdup was: Five crumpled cars 
were over on the shoulder, their drivers -- apparently uninjured -- pacing in 
the gravel around a California Highway Patrol car, talking to an officer with a 
clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
Past the wreckage, I could see that the freeway was wide open and traffic 
moving swiftly. But instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, I had to 
get off at the next exit and find a pay phone so that I could call my hostess 
and let her know I'd be late. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a newcomer to Orange County nearly six years ago, I would have been 
ashamed to show up 45 minutes late for anything. Back in the Midwest, where I 
came from, it just wasn't done. The only justifiable reasons for being that 
late were blizzards and floods, and in those cases everything was canceled 
anyway. And if there did happen to be a freeway accident serious enough to 
cause delays, no explanations were necessary because it would be the lead item 
on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
But the highways here are flooded every day, not with snow or water, but with 
cars and trucks, along with the occasional spilled load of something weird or 
toxic or both. So I soon learned not only that I couldn't promise to show up at 
a specified time, but that nobody really expected me to. 
</P>
<P>
It's an odd combination. We have in Orange County one of the nation's highest 
concentrations of expensive, fast, state-of-the-art cars. But when we get in 
them to go someplace, we have to approach the journey with an attitude of "I'll 
get there when I get there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that we don't try to be prompt; I know I do, and when I 
can't be, I try to call, at least. But if you're late, you're late. What can 
you do? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some situations simply have no flexibility. A few weeks ago, for 
example, I took a shuttle bus to Los Angeles International Airport. My flight 
was at 6:20 a.m, so the bus picked me up at 4 a.m. Sure enough, I was at the 
gate with time to spare -- a good thing, because my ticket was non-changeable 
and non-refundable. But most of us can't routinely allow two hours between 
appointments, which means that we're going to be late now and then. 
</P>
<P>
For business dealings, I still make appointments for specified times, and most 
of the time I arrive on time or a few minutes early, just in case. The same 
goes for dental and medical appointments, or scheduled events, such as last 
week's luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
But in other situations, there's more slack. When we go out for dinner, my 
friends and I meet in an area where the early arrivals can shop or browse until 
everyone has arrived. If we're going to a movie, we don't get irked if one of 
the group hasn't shown up by show time. We know it isn't a snub; they're just 
stuck in traffic somewhere. And if we're getting together at someone's house, 
we usually don't even set a time, not even "sevenish." Instead, we leave a 
"window" of a half hour or more either way. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, when I was arranging to visit a friend in Pasadena who used to 
work in Orange County, we considered the time of day and the routes I might 
take and decided that I'd be there sometime between 7 and 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I'll see you whenever you get here," he said. It's a phrase I'm hearing -- 
and using -- more and more. 
</P>
<P>
All this doesn't mean that I don't get frantic whenever I'm late; I'm not quite 
Southern-California-laid-back enough for that yet. My blood pressure still goes 
up. I still pound the steering wheel and make disparaging remarks about the 
ancestry of the drivers around me. I still worry that whoever is expecting me 
won't understand and that my life, or at least my day, will be ruined. But so 
far, that hasn't happened. And eventually, I get where I'm going. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of strange that this would happen to you, considering that it's the 
kind of thing you write about," said that patient hostess at last week's 
luncheon. Not at all, I told her. That's exactly why I write about it. 
</P>
<P>
Looking Like New 
</P>
<P>
Do you wash your car often? Or do you wait until the kids can write graffiti in 
the dust? We'd like to know about your car-cleaning habits, inside and out. Do 
you wash it yourself? What kind of cleaner works best? Do you insist on a 
chamois, or will paper towels and rags do just as well? Maybe you go to a 
carwash. Or do you prefer having your car detailed? 
</P>
<P>
A Little Road Music 
</P>
<P>
What's the sound track for your daily commute? Do you prefer rock to get you 
going, or easy-listening to calm your nerves? Maybe you keep it on the all-news 
channel. Tell us what you like to listen to when you drive, and why. 
</P>
<P>
Life on (2) Wheels 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you out there, zipping between lanes. Are you crazy, brave, or what? If 
you travel the freeways and surface streets of Orange County on a motorcycle, 
we'd like to hear from you. Why do you prefer that mode of transportation? How 
often are your brushes with death? And how do you feel about helmets?

The slump season? Orange County has never heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
Those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer only stimulate social activity in orange 
blossom land, where just last week, amid a frenzy of security measures, Vice 
President Dan Quayle partied for the Grand Old Party at the new Five Feet Too 
restaurant in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the slew of soirees that surrounded the recent visit by the 
Kirov Ballet, and all the elite at-home splashes -- such as the exotic 
Caribbean-style shindig held by the Angels of the Arts on Saturday at Deeann 
Baldwin's ultramodern Emerald Bay digs. 
</P>
<P>
As local socialites ready new ball gowns for the official opening of Orange 
County's social season -- South Coast Repertory's annual ball on Sept. 16 -- 
others have been dressing down with flair for such avant-garde gatherings as 
the "Another Opening! Another Show!" benefit staged on Sunday at Five Feet Too. 
</P>
<P>
This party for the Laguna Art Museum -- not the gourmet feast prepared for the 
Quayle visit -- was billed as the official opening of the bistro that has 
locals learning how to wield black lacquer chopsticks with panache. 
</P>
<P>
"And tonight I get to be myself," said Five Feet Too owner Michael Kang, his 
starched white chef's jacket flopped open at the neck. "And that could be a 
security problem. Maybe I'll take my clothes off!" (He didn't. But he did hop 
up on the kitchen counter to strike a pose for the paparazzi.) 
</P>
<P>
The party, the second in the museum's Perspectives series, had a futuristic 
flair, with decor dreamed up to reflect Orange County in the year 2020. For 
example, the pitch-black tables were graced with bottles of "San Onofre water" 
(available, said event co-chairman Anton Segerstrom, "because in the year 2020, 
San Onofre will have been converted from a nuclear power plant to a water 
desalinization facility -- the water shortage in Southern California, you 
know"). 
</P>
<P>
And a weathered orange sat at each place setting. "The oranges are from 
Alaska," explained a tongue-squarely-in-cheek Segerstrom. "The greenhouse 
effect melted the polar cap, so you can no longer grow oranges in Southern 
California, you know." Another sad touch: a fragment of "the last orange tree 
in Southern California" sat in a display case in front of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
You'd have thought the 100 or so guests would be a little down, with all the 
grim reminders of the way they were. But no. They giggled. They squealed. They 
gyrated to an otherworldly sounding band. They wolfed down pizza, soup, 
burritos and aged black angus New York steaks dressed with a secret sauce. 
</P>
<P>
And they philosophized: "I won't even be here in the year 2020!" said 
co-chairwoman Norma Glover. "But isn't this a blast?" 
</P>
<P>
Faces in the crowd: museum director Charles Desmarais, Don and Claudette Shaw, 
Barry Brief, Vesta Curry, Bob and Nadine Hall, Teri and John Kennady, Sandy and 
Harold Price, and Margie Shackelford. 
</P>
<P>
Mark your calendar for these remaining Perspectives parties: On Sept. 15, Betty 
Edwards, author of "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain," will speak at Mary 
Newman's Corona del Mar home; Ed Chatlin will teach guests how to sculpt on 
Sept. 17 at Tricia and Al Nichols' Laguna Beach manse; on Sept. 24, guests will 
have lunch at restaurateurs Bill Magnuson and Ulf Strandberg's (they own Gustaf 
Anders in Santa Ana) Laguna Beach retreat; and on Sept. 28, guests will hear 
Charles Credard and Alan Fausel, noted authorities on California art, talk 
about the booming California art market at the home of Martha and Jim Newkirk. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, Dolores Milhous of Linda Isle will take guests on a Newport Bay 
cocktail cruise and treat them to an Italian feast, and a murder mystery party 
and progressive dinner will be staged Oct. 21 at the homes of Gail and Ron 
Waters, Anne and Howard Cusic, and Jane and Joe Hanauer. Tickets are $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and wow! It wasn't easy. In fact, he almost 
threw in the towel. But after solving extensive problems with water seepage, 
Bob Elliott of Linda Isle got his below-sea-level wine cellar. It, and the rest 
of his breathtaking new manse, was on view Sunday when Chapman 100 staged a 
Summer Sizzler to make money for Chapman College scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Guests, dressed in California casual wear (the dress code on invitations this 
summer), mingled among the 17 varieties of imported marble at Debbi and Bob 
Elliott's, whose home is between billionaire Donald Bren's and author Joseph 
Wambaugh's. They sipped champagne, nibbled at cheese puffs and waxed ecstatic 
over the cellar's wine collection, the prize of which is a $1,500 bottle of 
1961 Chateau Lafite Rothschild.

TWO PRO-CHOICE SOLDIERS WIN GROUP'S SALUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana Heights resident Pat Cox described herself as a Republican and an 
active member of the Presbyterian church. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Miles said, right off, "I have five children of my own, and my husband 
has five children from a previous marriage. We're a big family." 
</P>
<P>
These two might be considered unlikely foot soldiers in the war for women's 
reproductive rights. "The stereotypes have gotta go," said Cox, briskly. "This 
is about a woman's choice." 
</P>
<P>
Cox and Miles were honored on Saturday by members and friends of the South 
Coast Organization of Planned Parenthood -- a fund-raising group they founded 
11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the benefit -- a Mexican-themed buffet dinner held in a banquet 
building in Costa Mesa -- were 110 guests who paid $125 each. The evening 
netted about $12,000 for the local chapter of Planned Parenthood, according to 
event chairwoman Gloria Longley. 
</P>
<P>
During cocktail hour, mariachis serenaded, margaritas flowed and waiters 
bearing silver trays stacked with crispy goodies (chicken flautas, nachos, 
empanadas) threaded through the casually attired crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests was Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of the local chapter 
of Planned Parenthood. Seigle said that although the pro-choice movement had 
suffered setbacks lately -- including an unfavorable Supreme Court decision and 
the governor's recent budget cuts for family planning services -- she was 
encouraged by the reaction of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The public support that has come out has been overwhelming," she said. "We've 
gotten hundreds of calls: 'What can I do?' 'How can I help?' 'Can I stuff 
envelopes for you?' 'Where do I send the check?' It's been phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
The same reaction was noted by Phyllis Wallace, president of the 106-member 
fund-raising group founded by Cox and Miles. "We've had a lot of activity 
lately," she said. "I think that many people feel that Roe vs. Wade (the 1973 
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) is something they don't want to see 
reversed." 
</P>
<P>
Miles stressed the "many positive things about Planned Parenthood," such as its 
fertility clinic, pregnancy counseling and prenatal care programs. 
</P>
<P>
"And choice is positive," she added. "Sometimes, when people find out about my 
big family, they say, 'Barbara! How can you -- of all people -- be involved 
with Planned Parenthood?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I say: 'Listen. I had five children because I love children. And I support 
Planned Parenthood because I love children. Anyone who thinks this organization 
is anti-child is wrong, wrong, wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising for AIDS: The hills were alive with the sound of music. And 
laughter. And a couple of dozen belly-flopped splashes! 
</P>
<P>
By the time the sun blazed its last on Sunday, the back-yard party at Al 
Roberts' and Ken Jillson's Laguna Beach digs had netted more than $120,000 for 
the AIDS Services Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' and Jillson's fourth annual "Big Splash" bash -- an afternoon 
get-together highlighted by a stage show of Jillson's creation -- drew 400 
guests at ticket prices ranging from $50 for general admission to $10,000 for 
dinner and eight pool-side seats for the show. 
</P>
<P>
This year's entertainment was a musical tribute to Hollywood, performed by a 
cast of 35 amateurs who made up for their lack of talent or rehearsal time with 
the sheer joy of their vamped-up abandon. 
</P>
<P>
There were Mae West, with three-inch eyelashes, and Annette Funicello, 
shimmying at her own Muscle Beach party. Carmen Miranda, Faye Wray, Esther 
Williams and the Andrews Sisters were among the others making waves (some 
literally, splashing the top-ticket donors) before the 50-minute spectacle was 
through and guests made for the buffet tables. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an incredible day because the community can be together in one place 
and because everyone knows that all the money they spent (for tickets) is 
actually going to help others," said Joel Miller, executive director of the 
AIDS Services Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said proceeds from the event -- which was completely underwritten by 
Roberts and Jillson -- will be used for direct-assistance cash grants to cover 
outstanding bills for AIDS patients in financial crisis, to fund ASF's food 
bank and to cover costs at the two residences for AIDS patients run by the 
foundation.

Immigration agents rounded up 54 illegal aliens boarding flights at Los Angeles 
International Airport early today, bringing to 131 the number of arrests made 
in a week-long crackdown on alien smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants, from Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and 
Mexico, were arrested while trying to board red-eye flights to the East Coast 
and other parts of the country, said Ernest Gustafson, district director for 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said the aliens were dropped off at the airport in clusters by 
smugglers, who were paid $1,000 to $2,000 by their "human cargo." Officials 
seized a car owned by a smuggler, but none were arrested, Gustafson said.

The suspected gunman in the racially motivated slaying of a black teen-ager in 
Brooklyn surrendered to police in upstate New York today, ending a weeklong 
manhunt in a killing that sparked tension citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Oneonta police said Joseph Fama walked into the police station and said he was 
wanted for murder in New York City. Oneonta is about 130 miles northwest of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Fama, 18, shot Yusef Hawkins on Aug. 23 in 
Brooklyn's predominantly white Bensonhurst neighborhood, where the 16-year-old 
and three black friends had gone to look at a used car. Police said the four 
blacks were mistaken for friends of a white woman in the neighborhood who 
reportedly had switched boyfriends to date a black man.

Morris (Moe) Dalitz, a leading Las Vegas businessman and gaming pioneer, died 
early today at his home here. He was 89 and had been in ill health for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to Las Vegas in 1949, Dalitz acquired an ownership 
interest in the Desert Inn and Stardust hotels. In the early 1950s he entered a 
partnership to form Paradise Development Co., which built Sunrise Hospital, the 
Boulevard Mall, the Las Vegas Country Club, the city's convention center and 
many buildings at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.

Dalitz was listed in a 1978 California attorney general's report on organized

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN RADER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
JUROR HOLDS OUT TO FREE ACCUSED KILLER OF VALLEY FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror holding out for acquittal today forced a mistrial in the prosecution of 
Harvey Rader, a one-time Reseda auto dealer accused of killing a San Fernando 
Valley family of four in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors vowed to re-try Rader, possibly as soon as next month. 
</P>
<P>
The mistrial, declared by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell, 
prompted a relative of the victims to burst into tears in the courtroom's back 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said after they were dismissed that the lone holdout, who 
avoided reporters, insisted that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence 
against the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bodies Never Found 
</P>
<P>
Rader, 47, became a suspect shortly after the murders of Sol Salomon, his wife, 
Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and Mitchell, 9. Their bodies 
were never found and Rader has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Sol Salomon had a business relationship with Rader that soured, according to 
Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Lonnie A. Felker, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rader was arrested in 1983 after his cousin, Ashley Paulle, told Los Angeles 
authorities that Rader killed the Salomons and that he had been Rader's 
accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Paulle told authorities that Rader shot Sol Salomon, beat Elaine to death, 
killed Mitchell with a baseball bat and strangled Michalle. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the district attorney's office gave Paulle immunity in return for 
his testimony against Rader. But it later revoked that promise and sought to 
prosecute Paulle as well. 
</P>
<P>
But a court here later threw out the case against Paulle, ruling that the 
district attorney's office had improperly revoked the immunity promise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remained in London 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Paulle has returned to his native London and refused to return to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The jury had deliberated for about three weeks before reaching what the judge 
called "a hopeless" deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
"A hung jury is not a very satisfactory result," Parnell said, adding, however, 
that she had no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think justice was done in this case," Margaret Malarowitz, mother of 
Elaine Salomon, said outside court. "He (Rader) has no right to walk the 
streets. I'll never stop. I'm going to see that justice will be done." 
</P>
<P>
In court, Malarowitz had burst into tears after the jury foreman told Parnell 
that the panel of six men and six women had deadlocked at 11-1 in favor of 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Felker was out of town on vacation, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Ann Ferrero, 
who stood in for him, said a pretrial proceeding in the re-trial has been set 
for Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy Public Defender Mark Lessem, who defended Rader, said his 
client was "disappointed," adding: "We had hoped to win." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, a British subject, was returned today to the County Jail, where he has 
been held without bail since his arrest last summer after he completed a 
federal prison term for passport fraud.

MASSIVE E. GERMAN ESCAPE PLAN DEVISED; 
</P>
<P>
HUNGARY, W. GERMANS READY TO MOVE 20,000 BY RAIL, SOURCES SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Hungarian and West German officials have devised a plan that would allow up to 
20,000 East Germans to flee to the West in the next few days, government 
sources disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the 150,000 to 200,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary are 
thought to be seeking passage to West Germany, and Bonn and Budapest have 
agreed to help them, the sources said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Austrian officials confirmed Bonn had asked them to arrange for 
special rail transportation for 15,000 to 20,000 East Germans to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
A reported plan to allow East Germans out of Hungary without the usual 
documents authorizing their departure may have been intentionally leaked by 
officials to let would-be emigres in East Germany know about the rare escape 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Most areas of East Germany receive Western radio or TV broadcasts, and the 
reports of the purported agreement between West Germany and Hungary were widely 
circulated today. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Austria had agreed to allow the escapes during the next few days, one 
West German official told the Associated Press: "I cannot deny that." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, West Germany has denied it is working with Hungary to aid the 
escapees. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen described reports of the plan as "pure 
speculation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Austrian Railways officials in Vienna told the Associated Press they 
had been asked by Bonn to ready railroad cars for a mass transport of refugees 
from the Hungarian border on Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
One official said he expected the exodus sooner, perhaps this weekend. He said 
West German railroad administrators told them to prepare for up to 20,000 East 
German passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian Railways has promised to make up to 50 train cars available within six 
hours at an unspecified border point with Hungary, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
A Frankfurt-based national newspaper said the refugees would be allowed passage 
to West Germany on the basis of their East German visas for Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported that the "pragmatic solution" had 
been worked out between West Germany and Hungary during confidential 
negotiations.

Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, is separating from her 
husband, Mark Phillips, after 15 years of marriage, but they do not plan to 
divorce, Buckingham Palace announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The queen, on holiday at Balmoral, Scotland, was described by royal sources to 
be "obviously saddened" but to understand the couple's decision, which was 
taken in principle earlier this year, according to Press Assn., Britain's 
domestic news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. Mark Phillips have decided 
to separate on terms agreed between them," the announcement said. "There are no 
plans for divorce proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the separation were not disclosed, but Anne, 39, will continue to 
live at the couple's home, Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire, 80 miles west of 
London. Phillips, 40, will move to another house nearby, the palace said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 8, will live with their mother at 
Gatcombe, and Phillips will have full access to them, the palace said. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said Phillips was receiving a financial settlement from the 
queen that would make him wealthy. The palace said it was unable to comment on 
a cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Anne, in Puerto Rico for a meeting of the International Olympic 
Committee, brushed past reporters this morning without answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
Palace informants said the couple had already decided to part before an 
incident last April when affectionate letters written to Anne by royal aide 
Timothy Laurence, 35, were stolen and sent to the Sun newspaper. Details of the 
letters were not disclosed, but the disclosure of the princess' close relations 
with the handsome Royal Navy commander, an aide to her mother, provoked a rash 
of speculation about how long her marriage could last. 
</P>
<P>
Philips has been linked with various women, most recently a 45-year-old public 
relations consultant in Canada with whom he was reported to have been seen at 
candle-lit dinners.

Chad and Libya signed a peace accord today that calls for an end to fighting 
over a disputed strip of desert that has been the focus of 16 years of 
bloodshed, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Algiers by Chadian Foreign Minister Acheikh Ibn 
Oumar and his Libyan counterpart, Jaddallah Talhi. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the parties to try to resolve their dispute through a 
political settlement within a year. If that fails, they are to take the issue 
to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to rule on who holds 
sovereignty over the Aozou strip, a 45,000-square-mile band of mineral-rich 
desert between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Chadian Embassy in Paris, Chad and Libya agreed to the 
withdrawal of all forces from the disputed region, leaving it under the 
administration of a group of African observers until the court renders its 
decision.

Vietnam's leadership admitted today altering the last testament of revered 
leader Ho Chi Minh, falsifying the date of his death and defying his wish to be 
cremated. 
</P>
<P>
A communique signed by Communist Party leader Nguyen Van Linh said the party 
Politburo decided to preserve Ho's remains instead of following his wish to be 
cremated so that Vietnamese from the defeated south and foreigners could pay 
their respects to him. Ho had requested that his ashes be placed in three urns, 
one each for northern, central and southern Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Linh wrote that the Politburo also decided to announce that Ho died on Sept. 3, 
1969, instead of his actual date of death, Sept. 2, because Sept. 2 is 
Vietnam's national day. He said the leaders falsified the date "to prevent the 
date of Uncle Ho's death from coinciding with the day of great national 
rejoicing."

MURDERS PROMPT ENTERTAINMENT FIRM TO ORDER INTERNAL REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
The execution-style murders of entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his 
wife have prompted his company, LIVE Entertainment, to hire an outside law firm 
to conduct an internal review, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
"All who worked with (Menendez) find it inconceivable that he was involved in 
any unsavory dealings that might have led to this tragic event," the company 
said in a prepared statement, adding that "many of the rumors which are the 
subject of press speculation are frankly absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were found dead Aug. 20 in their Beverly 
Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Although police have refused to disclose details of the slayings, The Times 
reported Wednesday that sources close to the case said the couple were killed 
by at least two people who fired more than a dozen blasts from 12-gauge 
shotguns, including a coup de grace shot to Menendez after he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, LIVE said it is cooperating with police and has retained the 
law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison "to assist us in 
conducting an internal review." 
</P>
<P>
The company did not specify what areas of its business will be reviewed.

NATION'S BIGGEST RETAILERS REPORT MIXED SALES RESULTS FOR AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's biggest retailers today issued mixed sales reports for August, 
with department and apparel stores benefiting from back-to-school business but 
mass merchandisers suffering through another month of lackluster results. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said consumers continued to spend carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not boom times, and we see a cautious consumer," said Walter Loeb, 
an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. "I believe we are heading for a 
slow-growth period." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and 
retail sales are considered a key indicator of spending trends. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have cut back on purchases of what are called discretionary items -- 
as opposed to necessities such as food -- because of rising mortgage payments 
and other credit costs. 
</P>
<P>
Their caution has hurt big general storeowners such as the nation's largest 
retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sears said its August sales were up 2.3% overall, but sales at stores open at 
least a year -- known as same-store or comparable-store sales in the industry 
-- fell 1.1%. K mart Corp. also had a disappointing August, with overall sales 
up 4.8% and same-store sales up 1.5%.

The Yugoslav national bank is planning to introduce a 1-million-dinar bank note 
this fall, the official Tanjug news agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The new note, worth $35 at the current rate, is intended to ease difficulties 
caused by the country's 800% annual inflation rate. One dollar is worth almost 
30,000 dinars today. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavs and foreign tourists are obliged to carry huge quantities of paper 
money even when doing simple everyday shopping, and banks and other financial 
institutions have reported growing confusion in counting, handling and storing 
the vast quantities of small, nearly worthless, bills.

Sir James Goldsmith, one of the three financiers leading the hostile takeover 
bid for BAT Industries PLC, said today a British regulatory panel must extend 
its deadline or his takeover attempt will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all conditions of a bid, 
including U.S. regulatory hurdles, must be completed within 81 days of the 
posting of the bidder's formal offer document. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see the offer 
succeeding," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., posted its $21.4-billion bid 
for BAT and its U.S. subsidiaries Aug. 8, which leaves the group 58 days to 
meet U.S. regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has significant 
interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S. 
holdings as Farmers Insurance Group and the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall 
Field department stores.

Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, who is battling inoperable stomach and lung 
cancer, was released Wednesday from University Hospital in Denver after being 
admitted Monday night for treatment of a fever. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, 21, was "doing fine," according to Dr. Wayne Gersoff, team physician. 
Gersoff said Aunese's temperature was near 101. "That's not catastrophically 
high, but for someone in his condition, it was high enough (to warrant 
hospitalization)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although growth of the tumor in Aunese's stomach has apparently slowed, Gersoff 
said Aunese's battle continues. He likened Aunese's fight for life to a 
three-way skirmish: the tumor versus his body, chemotherapy versus the tumor 
and the patient versus chemotherapy.

The Assn. of Tennis Professionals today toughened its code of conduct and drug 
tests. The group, which takes over control of the men's tour in 1990, also 
announced a new ranking system and changes to speed up play while allowing 
breaks between sets. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the four-step penalty system -- warning, point, game, default -- ATP 
Tour-sanctioned events will have a three-step system -- warning, point, default 
-- and the group will add testing for steroids and other possible 
performance-enhancing drugs to the tests already done to detect cocaine, heroin 
and amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
The association also said it will change its computer rankings to reflect the 
player's best 14 results, and players with 10 or more years on the circuit will 
be allowed to play fewer tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The association will also speed up play by reducing the maximum time between 
points from 30 seconds to 25 and mandating tie-breakers for all sets, including 
final sets, in tour events. There will be a 90-second break at the end of each 
set.

LEMOND GETS $5.7-MILLION SALARY FROM FRENCH TEAM

<P>
Greg LeMond, the newly crowned world cycling champion and two-time Tour de 
France winner, has agreed to a three-year $5.7-million contract with a combined 
French team. 
</P>
<P>
An international bidding war sparked by the most dramatic Tour de France finish 
in history has elevated LeMond to the same tax bracket as America's 
highest-paid baseball, football and basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond will be paid $1.8 million in 1990, which gives him a higher salary than 
Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway. Elway, in the middle of a six-year 
$12.7-million pact, earns $1.45 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond's salary this year was reported between $500,000 and $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with two merged French teams, Z and Fagor, will be guaranteed by a 
bank letter of credit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, LeMond will enter six U.S. races in a Denver-based Coors Light 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The brewery paid LeMond an estimated $225,000 as a co-sponsor this season. The 
final figure has not been worked out for next year but could be lower because 
LeMond will probably not ride in this country's biggest race, the Tour de 
Trump.
