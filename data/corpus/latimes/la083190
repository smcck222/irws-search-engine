SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: NO MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS 
BIRDBRAINED SUGGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I like birds, I really do. 
</P>
<P>
I rescued a bird from a neighbor's cat. I feed the ducks at the Wild Animal 
Park. I brake for birds. 
</P>
<P>
However, I prefer real birds to imaginary birds conjured up by enviro-lobbyists 
and enviro-bureaucrats. Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council is considering whether to build a 2.4-mile road 
through Mission Trails Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The road, an extension of Jackson Drive, would connect the very busy Mission 
Gorge Road and California 52. The goal is to ease traffic on residential 
streets in Allied Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report has been completed, processed by the Planning 
Department and sent to the council. It says the road will disturb about 2.6 
acres of bird habitat. 
</P>
<P>
As ecological penance, and to keep the bird-loving federal government at bay, 
the report suggests that the city buy and maintain 6.1 acres for birds 
somewhere else. You always have to replace more than you destroy. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds fair. If we wreck the home of a woodpecker or a red-breasted thrush, we 
should provide him and his family with a suitable replacement, no? 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't any birds on the 2.6 acres. The last bird was spotted in 1975, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
And the habitat is hardly a work of nature. Actually, it's a drainage ditch 
built by man and then left untended so that weeds grew up in the soggy dirt. 
</P>
<P>
If the drainage ditch had been cleaned regularly, there would have been no 
weeds, no potential habitat and no need for "off-site mitigation." But it 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to some bureaucrats at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
They find this situation somewhere on the far side of ridiculous. They won't be 
quoted; the last thing they want is to get into a dispute with environmental 
groups or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
One estimate says it will cost the city $30,000 per acre for the 6.1 acres. 
</P>
<P>
You can do the multiplication yourself on the full cost of protecting phantom 
birds. Feel free to shed some taxpayer tears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
So's Your Mufti 
</P>
<P>
The media go to war. 
</P>
<P>
* Navy Capt. Michael Sherman is in Saudi Arabia to take charge of media 
relations for the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
He has already had experience working in a hostile part of the world rife with 
tribalism and ancient hatreds: Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He's normally the Navy's liaison with the movie industry, including advising on 
the San Diego filming of "The Hunt for Red October." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman has yet another qualification for Saudi duty. "He can swear in Arabic," 
says a friend in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Timing is all. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ghougassian, former ambassador to Qatar, had trouble getting noticed by 
the media when he was running for the Republican nomination in San Diego's 44th 
Congressional District last spring (and losing). 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
He has done 14 interviews in two weeks on the U.S.-Iraq standoff, including 
with local reporters, the television networks and Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
* In reaction to a Times story about Camp Pendleton, a woman from Alhambra 
writes that the Marine Corps should take its own camp followers to Saudi Arabia 
to maintain morale. 
</P>
<P>
But she's not a candidate: "I am a skinny 80-year-old, married 57 years, so 
would be ineligible." 
</P>
<P>
See, everybody wants somebody else to do the dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Thanks, I'm Depressed 
</P>
<P>
Things in general. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego diet: consume lots of serious drama. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at the intermission snack bar at the La Jolla Playhouse boomed during the 
zany "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the somber "My Children! My Africa!" 
</P>
<P>
Snack bar sales are way down. 
</P>
<P>
* Poster on the fence of a downtown construction site: "King Stahlman Bail 
Bonds. Unofficial Bail Bondsman for the Over the Line Tournament." 
</P>
<P>
* Bumper sticker spotted in parking lot of Coronado golf course: 
"Archaeologists Assume Superposition."

OCEANSIDE ASKS JUDGE TO REVIEW GROWTH LAW; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: CITY FILES MOTION REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OF A DECISION THAT 
FAVORED DEVELOPERS IN A SUIT OVER BUILDING LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside has asked Vista Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Hoffman to reconsider 
his decision that favored developers in a suit against the city's 
growth-control law. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Charles Revlett said Thursday that a motion has been filed asking 
Hoffman to change his Aug. 23 ruling because, he contends, it was based on 
factual and legal errors. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the motion is set for Sept. 17. The issue is being monitored by 
cities throughout the state that have growth limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's decision favored the Building Industry Assn. of San Diego and 
developer Del Oro Hills by concluding that the city's growth control law, 
Proposition A, does not guarantee enough lower-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the association praised the decision as doing much to invalidate 
Proposition A, it has become clear that Oceanside will continue to defend its 
law that was passed by voters in April 1987 and has cost the city $1.5 million 
in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Revlett said the City Council, which discussed the litigation in closed-door 
session Thursday, "is unified. They are well aware that, once an ordinance is 
passed by initiative, they have a duty . . . to implement that ordinance to the 
very best of their ability." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Bagley was reluctant to talk about the city's attitude, saying, "I 
don't want to say anything that would give comfort or discomfort" to the 
association or Del Oro Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The association's attorney, Donald Worley, was unavailable Thursday to comment 
on the city's request for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A limits residential building to 800 units a year, or a cumulative 
total of 10,600 new dwellings by 1999. The 10,600 figure includes additional 
units that are exempt from Proposition A, including housing for seniors, low-or 
moderate-income families and rehabilitated units. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoffman agreed that Oceanside has exceeded its fair share of 
affordable housing, he felt Proposition A didn't assure that the city would 
provide sufficient lower-income housing in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Revlett argued that the judge based his decision on errors, including an 
undercount of how many affordable housing units the city actually has plans to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
If Hoffman declines to reconsider, Revlett said he "definitely would not rule 
out" filing a writ to request that the state Court of Appeal consider the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of that appeal could help determine whether there is a trial, now 
planned to begin in October, over a separate aspect of Proposition A.

AUTHORITIES BLAME FATAL FIRE ON CHILDREN PLAYING WITH MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young children playing with matches in a neighbor's carport started a fire 
Wednesday that killed an 80-year-old woman, fire investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The children, a boy and three girls, ranged in age from 6 to 8 years, said 
Detective Charlie Inot of the Metro Arson Strike Team. 
</P>
<P>
"They ignited some newspapers on top of a chair in the carport, and the fire 
got out of control and went up into the house," Inot said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeweline Wallace was found dead near the doorway of her second-story studio 
apartment in Southeast San Diego. She died of asphyxiation and burns, a 
coroner's office spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started Wednesday about 4:26 p.m. in a house in the 3500 block of 
Durant Street, and it took 30 firefighters more than two hours to put it out. 
</P>
<P>
The house was damaged and a car and a mobile home were destroyed, neighbors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor said he saw Wallace, who is hard of hearing, come out onto her porch 
while the fire raged, so he yelled for her to come down. 
</P>
<P>
"I called to her to come out, but she ran back in," neighbor Robert Woods said 
Thursday. "I tried to run up the steps after her, but all the steps caught 
fire. She probably got frightened and figured the safest place was to run back 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor said two of her daughters were with the group of children who 
had the matches, but told her they weren't the ones playing with them. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter "feels a little responsible because she didn't come and tell me 
(one of the children) had matches," Addra Regnier said. 
</P>
<P>
After the fire started, Regnier said, her daughter ran home to tell her parents 
about the fire. 
</P>
<P>
At least one, but possibly all four, of the children involved will be referred 
to the San Diego Fire Department Juvenile Fire Setters Program for counseling, 
Inot said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house, Lincoln McDaniel, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Regnier and her 7-year-old daughter, Beth, were saddened by the death of 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids knew her, she used to give them cookies and soda," Regnier said. "She 
was a grandmother to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who was a widow, shared the small apartment with her sister, and the 
McDaniel family lived in the main house below, neighbors said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAHONY ASKS REVIEW OF ABORTION FOES' 
SENTENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has asked prosecutors and the courts to 
review what he believes are "unusually harsh" sentences imposed on abortion 
foes convicted of trespassing in protests outside women's clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In letters mailed earlier this week to Los Angeles Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Reiner, City Atty. James Hahn, the presiding judge of the Superior Court, 
Richard Byrne, and the presiding Municipal Court judge, Jon Mayeda, Mahony 
asked that they gather the arrest and sentencing records of demonstrators 
convicted of trespassing and other misdemeanor offenses during clinic protests 
in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
"By analyzing this data, you and I will be able to compare the arrest records 
and sentences imposed in connection with pro-life activities to arrest records 
and sentences imposed in other cases," the archbishop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner and Hahn had the day off and were not available for comment Thursday, 
and there was no immediate response from the two judges.

DEVELOPERS ASK COUNTY TO EASE PROPOSED LIMITS ON SANTA CLARITA GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of developers urged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Thursday to relax the restrictions of a proposed county plan that would 
dramatically reduce growth in the Santa Clarita Valley during the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed General Plan, recently approved by the Regional Planning 
Commission, developers who now hope to build 38,000 housing units would be 
limited to 12,500 units. The proposal is an attempt to hold the valley's 
population, now estimated at 147,000, to 270,000 by 2010. The crackdown on 
rapid growth was triggered by concern that the fast-growing area was far 
outstripping its ability to provide additional schools, roads, police and fire 
stations and water. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hearing, the supervisors said they would decide on Oct. 18 
whether to modify the proposed General Plan. The board members offered no clues 
as to how they would vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Vannatta, planning deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said he 
thought the board would probably do only "fine-tuning" of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll see wholesale changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners who testified Thursday said they hoped their projects would be 
exempt from the proposed curtailments. And many offered to pay for improvements 
such as parks, school sites, roads and water treatment plants to increase their 
chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
At least two developers even brought along community supporters to show that 
their housing projects were too worthwhile to jeopardize. And three Santa 
Clarita Valley school superintendents enthusiastically testified on behalf of 
two major housing projects. It was an unusual sight because the superintendents 
usually have fought vigorously against proposed housing projects for fear that 
the newcomers' children would overwhelm the schools. In some cases, the school 
districts have sued the developers and county to stop projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Battles between the schools and developers in the Santa Clarita Valley have a 
long history," said Scott Brown, superintendent of the Castaic Union School 
District. But he told the board he supported a major Castaic development after 
the builder promised to donate two elementary school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed General Plan, the developer of the Northlake subdivision 
would be permitted to build 1,800 homes in Castaic instead of 3,000. To make 
the larger subdivision acceptable to residents and the board, the developer has 
promised to donate sites for a library, fire station and two parks. The builder 
also threw a barbecue for 900 Castaic residents. 
</P>
<P>
Yet members of the Santa Clarita City Council, who want to limit unchecked 
growth in the unincorporated portion of the valley, urged the board not to give 
in to the developers' desires. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask the County Board of Supervisors to resist the pressure that you will be 
getting at this hearing and not increase the future housing unit and population 
count further," said Carl Boyer III, Santa Clarita's mayor pro tem.

FAX BLIZZARD URGED IN BID TO RESCUE CCC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to keep the California Conservation Corps in the San Fernando Valley 
proceeded on two fronts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Valley legislators mounted a campaign to inundate Gov. George Deukmejian with 
letters urging that he rescind a budget cut that would close the corps' center 
on Oat Mountain, north of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
And the CCC chief appealed for donation of an office in the Valley that the 
corps could use if the center must close. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the corps, which pays young people minimum wage to work on 
natural resource and emergency assistance projects, announced plans to close 
the Oat Mountain center by Oct. 5 due to budget cuts. Since 1978, an average of 
60 to 80 CCC youths have lived in rugged dormitory quarters atop Oat Mountain 
to work on Valley projects. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that closure won't result in reduced services for the Valley, the CCC 
should open a satellite office that would be a daily congregation point for 
corps members working in the Valley, said Bud Sheble, CCC executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my recommendation," Sheble said. "What we're seeking now is community 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the corps had considered replacing the Oat Mountain center by 
staffing its Valley projects with CCC workers based at the agency's centers in 
Camarillo, San Pedro and Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But the long commutes involved would delay the start of work and would lower 
productivity, Sheble said. A better plan for maintaining service would be to 
recruit CCC workers from the Valley, have them live at home and commute to a 
satellite office each day, he said. The satellite office would be both a 
morning congregation point for the work crews and a place to store tools and 
vehicles, Sheble said. 
</P>
<P>
Needed to make such a plan work, Sheble said, is someone to donate facilities 
for a satellite office. "We're hoping leaders like Assemblyman Katz and Sen. 
Robbins will help us in this regard," Sheble said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Sylmar, and Sen. Alan Robbins, D-Tarzana, have led 
the protests against Oat Mountain's closure. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Katz, Robbins and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson 
have called on several hundred community leaders to fax letters to the governor 
calling for money to keep Oat Mountain open. 
</P>
<P>
As a way to bolster the CCC's budget, Katz said he has asked the governor to 
consider advancing by two weeks the start-up date of a state tax on 
out-of-state vehicles that do not meet California emission standards. That 
measure alone could earn more than $7 million in additional revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through this before, and we won," Katz said. In the early 1980s, 
Deukmejian cut funding for Oat Mountain from the budget, a move later reversed 
amid an outcry similar to the one seen now, Katz said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man who drove his car into two men outside a bar, killing one of 
them, was sentenced Thursday to 15 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Guzman Valle of Escondido also was ordered to pay $6,000 in funeral 
expenses to the family of Alfredo Chavez Sandoval, 33, who watched the 
sentencing by San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the March 20 incident outside 
a Southeast San Diego bar. He earlier had been involved in a dispute with the 
two men over a woman inside the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman's attorney, Wayne Gomez, told the judge the defendant had no 
recollection of what had occurred that night. 
</P>
<P>
Although Guzman had been drinking and had cocaine in his system, the judge 
remarked that the defendant probably knew what was happening. "All of this over 
some misunderstanding in a bar," Mudd said. 
</P>
<P>
Injured in the same incident was Cirenio Samano, 34, who suffered a broken leg, 
but did not appear at the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, Guzman was a cook at a Rancho Bernardo seafood restaurant.

POLICE PREPARE FOR LONG WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans who love a good party will probably be out in force this weekend, 
armed with picnic baskets, coolers, boom boxes and plans for big Labor Day 
celebrations. Local law enforcement officials say they'll be ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the city has been savoring the prospect of a three-day weekend, 
law enforcement officers have been gearing up for one of the more hectic 
stretches of their working year. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Rick O'Hanlon estimated that 200,000 people will flock to city 
beaches on Monday. To meet that onslaught, the department's Northern Beach Team 
will deploy about 70 police personnel, including 40 to 50 uniformed officers 
just to handle potential problems in the Mission Bay and La Jolla Shores areas, 
O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
That's about triple the number of police that usually patrol the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have your drunks, fights that break out and large parties that you have to 
deal with," O'Hanlon said. Also, the Beach Team will close the parking lot at 
Sunset Point and use that area as a command post for its officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of those parking spaces might dismay some late-arriving beach-goers. 
O'Hanlon said police towed about 85 cars on the Fourth of July, and they may 
equal that record Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I would tell people is to come early," O'Hanlon said. "If 
you're not here by 10 o'clock, you're not going to get a space. And, if you're 
parked illegally, you're going to be towed." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend will be what California Highway Patrol officers call a "maximum 
enforcement period," said CHP spokesman Jim Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
That means that about 70% of the CHP's available work force will be on duty, 
contrasted with about 50% on an ordinary weekend, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
A local cellular phone company is also urging its customers to tip off CHP 
officers to drunken motorists this weekend, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
US West Cellular issued a release encouraging customers to use their car phones 
to dial 911 and report people driving erratically, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It increases the number of eyes that we'll have on the roadways, looking for 
erratic drivers," Anderson said. "We'll get some calls from them (car phone 
owners) this weekend, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
Like O'Hanlon, airport officials expect to be keeping tow truck operators busy 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Day is typically the third-busiest holiday at Lindbergh Field, ranking 
behind only Christmas and Thanksgiving, said Gerald Reas, the airport's 
director of land operations. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's parking lots will probably be filled throughout the weekend, Reas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon predicted that only one thing can stop the hordes from advancing to 
beaches this weekend: cloudy or rainy weather. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Atkin, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said police 
shouldn't expect too much help from Mother Nature. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The debate in Yucaipa over the "Impressions" reading series brings to mind 
another book that has long been banned in our public schools. 
</P>
<P>
It is a compilation of stories containing numerous descriptions of murder, 
torture, genocide, rape, bestiality, adultery, incest, homosexuality, group sex 
and devil worship. Ironically, it is still found in most church-run schools. It 
is, of course, the Bible.

JEROME ROSENSTEIN; PRECIOUS-METALS DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Rosenstein, a self-employed precious-metals dealer for 40 years, has 
died at his Burbank home. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenstein died Saturday of a heart attack, said his son, Barry Rosenstein. 
</P>
<P>
A native of New York City, Rosenstein moved to California in 1940. During World 
War II, he served three years in the U.S. Army, stationed in New Guinea. After 
he was discharged, he returned to California and settled in Burbank in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
He started buying and selling precious metals from pawn shops, a profession he 
continued until his death. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his son, Barry Rosenstein of Thousand Oaks; a sister, Alice 
McFall Hickok of Portland, Ore.; and a grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service was held Wednesday with burial at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park in 
Los Angeles, which handled the arrangements.

CAMPAIGN WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
WHY NOT THE BEST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's almost Labor Day, and the campaign for California governor is more than 
half over and not an inch closer to any distinction or intelligent discussion 
of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
The camp of former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein has sought to tar Sen. 
Pete Wilson with S&amp;L goo, but we don't think it'll stick. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson people have retaliated with similar charges about the involvement of 
Feinstein's husband in a questionable S&amp;L deal in Oregon, but we think the 
attack is a very questionable reach at best -- and, like the S&amp;L mud thrown 
at Wilson, utterly irrelevant to the reality of governing the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The sad truth about this campaign is that these are two candidates who do have 
something to offer voters, but they're not getting that message across. They 
are running for the most important governorship in the nation, and they're 
acting like two feuding small-town district bosses. They should wise up and 
show the voters what they have in their heads rather than what new campaign 
trick they have up their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
But newspapers often complain like this -- and just as often do very little 
themselves to elevate the campaign. So in the spirit of putting our newsprint 
where our mouth is, The Times has invited both candidates to participate in a 
series of issue face-offs on our Op-Ed Page. Both have agreed, and the series 
will start sometime in September. The point of the gubernatorial face-off is to 
give voters a better idea of how these two candidates think about the issues. 
We sincerely hope the series helps.

TUNNEL FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of Caltrans, District 7 -- and especially the bridge, construction, 
maintenance and traffic forces -- I want to express our thanks to the motoring 
public who helped us deal with the closing of the downtown Hollywood Freeway 
(101) due to last month's fire, which destroyed a portion of the RTD Metro Rail 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
I realize the inconvenience to commuters was horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
However, California drivers have proven once again that when we ask for their 
help, they are more than willing to respond. 
</P>
<P>
While the various freeway closures were in place, Caltrans' maintenance forces 
removed graffiti from signs and walls, replaced some signs and washed the rest. 
They also replaced 4,200 pavement markers; stenciled pavement markings on all 
closed ramps; repaired guardrails and one bridge joint; swept shoulder areas, 
as well as maintained closures and barricades at all approaches to the downtown 
101 slot. 
</P>
<P>
When Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol began reopening freeway 
sections and ramps, it was very gratifying to see motorists smile and give us 
the thumbs-up sign as they drove by. I also want to thank the Los Angeles City 
Department of Transportation and County Health; RTD/Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission/Metro Rail; the fire companies from throughout the 
Southland; the Los Angeles police and CHP, Cal/OSHA; Tutor-Salib-Perini, Metro 
Rail contractor and the Red Cross.

AND SO, ON TO BAGHDAD?; 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING GULF POLICY IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the days and weeks and probably months ahead, the resource America is going 
to need in greatest abundance is not more military hardware, ground forces or 
burden-sharing by allies, but wisdom. We are going to need a lot of that. But 
will we have enough when the crunch comes? One has to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Washington policy-makers are said to be deeply divided over the proper aim of 
U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. Some circles in the Bush Administration tilt 
toward a policy whose rationale absolutely requires the toppling of Saddam 
Hussein by whatever means necessary. They would not accept even the complete 
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait as an end-point in the military crisis. Direct 
military action against Iraq, not to mention Kuwait, is required. 
</P>
<P>
But that course goes disturbingly beyond the original purpose of the U.S. 
military commitment and would represent a substantial escalation of U.S. aims. 
The United States is in Saudi Arabia to deter aggression, to protect U.S. oil 
supplies and to defend Saudi Arabia, an important ally, the site of a great 
deal of the world's oil and a country in the same geopolitical ballpark as 
Israel, another ally this nation cares deeply about. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, absolutely: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait, as demanded by United Nation 
resolution, and it is the purpose of the punishing and nearly all-embracing 
economic embargo to effect that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq must also be prevented from realizing any design on Saudi Arabia. And that 
is precisely the purpose of the American military commitment, which, it must be 
said, has so far achieved its goal of deterring Iraq from Saudi Arabia with 
seeming surety. In that sense, it might be argued, U.S. policy is already a 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of the political and even biological future of Saddam Hussein 
is not an appropriate issue for U.S. military forces -- it is a problem for the 
Iraqis themselves. If the United States were to deal with that issue directly, 
it would put at risk the most startling and commendable achievement of the Bush 
Administration's crisis management in the gulf: the broad anti-Hussein 
international political consensus. 
</P>
<P>
If American forces are attacked in any way, our retaliation should be swift and 
merciless. But we must not risk a wider conflict by losing sight of the clarity 
that instructed our initial involvement two weeks ago. We especially owe it to 
the tens of thousands of American military personnel who are putting their 
lives on the line in the Persian Gulf to maintain a policy that is cool-headed, 
wise and just. 
</P>
<P>
It is a policy that must not be buffeted off course by the winds of domestic 
politics, or by the overreaching of military and policy theorists for whom war 
is a kind of academic exercise -- in theory an extension of diplomacy by other 
means. While threats of war may be an extension of diplomacy, war itself is the 
proof of diplomacy's failure. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee puts the 
issue clearly, leanly and correctly: "Our military mission is to defend Saudi 
Arabia." Let's keep that in mind.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE DENY POCKETING WAGES OF EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster electrical contractor and his wife pleaded not guilty Thursday to 
charges that they violated the state labor code by pocketing employee wages on 
public works projects in Santa Clarita and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster Municipal Judge Howard M. Swart set an Oct. 17 preliminary hearing 
date for James and Brenda Paxin of Paxin Electric Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who are free on their own recognizance, were charged earlier this 
month after a state investigation indicated that they falsified pay records in 
order to pocket $170,000 in employee wages on contracts at Lancaster City Hall 
and a Santa Clarita park. 
</P>
<P>
The Paxins both face charges of violating state labor law requiring the payment 
of the prevailing wage on public projects. James Paxin has also been charged 
with perjury for allegedly providing to government officials fraudulent pay 
documents that over-reported pay and under-reported hours worked by employees.

COLLEGE TEXTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I staunchly applaud the insightful educators who developed the long-overdue 
"Heath Anthology of American Literature" (Column One, Aug. 27). I'm personally 
gratified and professionally inspired that college students will have the 
opportunity to experience a more diverse and meaningful literary menu; one 
which more accurately reflects the multiethnic cultural fabric in our nation's 
campus populations. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities have an obligation to make great literature come 
alive, to inspire students to dance with their minds. Who can say Emerson's 
journals are more relevant to Latino students than a Mexican-American folk 
ballad? Where more appropriate for students to discover the beauty of American 
Indian writings than in a literature course? 
</P>
<P>
As a Latino educator, I strongly support the idea of expanding the traditional 
definition of the classics. Educators must refocus their creative vision and 
wake up to our multiethnic challenges.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHICANO UPRISING; 
</P>
<P>
DERAILED THEN, MAKE HISTORY NOW; 
</P>
<P>
LATINOS HAVE LEARNED AND ENDURED ENOUGH IN 20 YEARS TO START ASKING HARD 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERSISTENCE OF REPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLORIA J. ROMERO, Gloria J. Romero is an assistant professor of psychology 
at Cal State Los Angeles. She is a member of the 1990 National Chicano 
Moratorium Organizing Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month, the African-American community in Los Angeles observed the 
25th anniversary of the Watts uprising. This week, the Latino community is 
observing the 20th anniversary of the National Chicano Moratorium. The two 
events had similarities whose significance seems to have been lost over the 
intervening years. Each emerged as a community's legitimate protest against 
oppressive socioeconomic and political conditions -- which today stand far from 
being addressed as we had hoped two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1969, the median income of a Mexican-American family in Los 
Angeles was 29% below the statewide median; 16.7% lived below the poverty line; 
75% of our housing stock was more than 20 years old, and only 29% of it was 
considered sound. Today, the median family income for Chicanos is only 62% of 
that earned by white families nationally, while 28% of us live below the 
poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
For us Chicanos, the experience of Watts five years earlier was inspiring. It 
represented the determination of an oppressed people to fight the system and 
shed the yoke of racism. Little did we know that what happened in Watts had 
sanctioned the police apparatus' wide use of "safeguards" to ensure that an 
uprising of that magnitude would never be repeated here. 
</P>
<P>
The spark that unleashed the violence in both communities was caused by the 
same source: conflict with a racist law enforcement system. 
</P>
<P>
The height of our mass protest came during the National Chicano Moratorium, on 
Aug. 29, 1970, when more than 20,000 of us marched in East L.A. to protest the 
war in Vietnam and the disproportionately high casualty rates for Chicano 
troops at a time when we were denied equality at home. It was against this 
political climate that, when the march peacefully assembled for a rally in 
Laguna Park, 1,500 law officers tear-gassed and indiscriminately beat children, 
women and men under the excuse that shoplifting and bottle-throwing had 
occurred 1 1/2 blocks away. By day's end, three Chicanos had been killed and 
hundreds injured, and more than 400 had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The violent suppression not only altered the course of the Chicano movement; it 
significantly derailed it. It turned our organizing, spirit and energy away 
from anti-war efforts and focused our attention on the issue of police 
brutality and unequal justice (which still consumes too much of our time). 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of both the Watts and the Chicano uprisings, 
official commissions issued reports that focused on the violence that occurred 
rather than the reasons for the protest; both reports adopted a "blaming the 
victim" mentality. In our case, that attempt to distort the truth largely 
centered on the official justification that excessive force had been used 
because of moratorium organizers' presumed links to leftist and "communist" 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
What have we learned after 20 years? Well, we are keenly aware that history is 
made twice: in the actual unfolding of events and in the interpretation and 
recording of those events. It is the latter that is the most important if we 
are to survive as a people. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, history has been more kind in the recording of Watts. A book has 
been published, a major conference has been held, and the media have done cover 
stories, special sections and long analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for the National Chicano Moratorium. No book has been written, no 
in-depth analyses have been published. The Los Angeles Times has only run 
articles commemorating its columnist, Ruben Salazar, who was murdered that day 
when a 10-inch tear-gas projectile was fired into his skull by a sheriff's 
deputy. Despite evidence of a cover-up and a coroner's jury finding that 
Salazar had died "at the hands of another," the Sheriff's Department was 
exonerated of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, we are better equipped to interpret and record the history. 
It has taken us 20 years, but we have learned that the extensive police-state 
apparatus that was created to stifle our movement in 1970 was part and parcel 
of the open repression that was used against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 
African-American quest for equality. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, we understand that the repressive actions used against us 
on Aug. 29, 1970, were essentially no different from those that historically 
have been used to silence people -- particularly prominent critics -- 
struggling for justice anywhere. Ruben Salazar was one who had begun to suspect 
he would be silenced, but he never thought it would take murder to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In a society afflicted with historical amnesia, we should begin by correcting 
the record. The first step in this historical healing is demanding a reopening 
of the investigation into the murder of Ruben Salazar. The answers to many 
questions we have asked ourselves for 20 years are lying in sealed vaults. 
Twenty years have passed, and now we are better equipped to make history in the 
second round.

SIBERIA LONGS FOR A CONNECTION ACROSS THE PACIFIC; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: VLADIVOSTOK AND ITS REGION SMOLDER OVER THEIR ISOLATION FROM 
MOSCOW. WE SHOULD BUILD A BRIDGE OF SORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CURTIS PERRY, John Curtis Perry is director of the North Pacific 
Program at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's nearest overseas neighbor is the Soviet Union. Yet our view of that 
country is Eurocentric; we tend to look at it the long way, eastward across the 
Atlantic instead of westward across the Pacific. Many people in Vladivostok, 
the leading city of Pacific Siberia, are urging us to look across the Pacific. 
Don't ignore the regions closest to you, they say. 
</P>
<P>
At a time of global trend from nationalism and centralization to regionalism 
and local authority, the geography of proximity takes on new importance. Yet 
Vladivostok, headquarters of the Soviet Pacific fleet, has remained remote to 
Americans and even Soviet citizens because of poorly developed transportation 
networks and government security policy. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to this long-sealed fortress city, capital of the Primorie (Maritime 
Province) reveals a smoldering rage against the Moscow bureaucracy and a warm 
desire for economic independence for the region. Some are even talking of 
political autonomy. In the Primorie's case, yearnings for greater independence 
do not stem from ethnic differences with Moscow (Slavs heavily predominate in 
the Soviet Far East) but erupt instead from a sense of administrative abuse. 
"They treat us like a colony!" is the cry. Local people find the central 
authorities condescending in their attitudes and incompetent at dealing with 
local problems. Why for instance, Vladivostok asks, is Leningrad dictating the 
study of Pacific oceanography? What do they know about the Pacific? 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is to blame, the local economy is certainly in a bad way, 
suffering from its narrow base of timber, fish and extractive industries. The 
region must import 50% of its food. Existence is characterized by scarcity, 
dilapidation and alarming environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot believe how bad our life is," one woman scientist remarks. "We talk 
of nothing but the struggle to find essential material things: food, clothing, 
a flat." No wonder turnover is high; many workers and intellectuals who come to 
the Far East soon leave in disgust. Yet the foreign visitor is impressed by the 
courage and intellect of the people, their savage self-mocking humor and 
ruthless candor. "We are survivors," they say proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Civilians do not conceal their resentment toward the military. "They have made 
of our Primorie a wasteland surrounded by a hedge of missiles," one scholar 
remarks. Some people talk of the desirability of getting the Navy out and 
wistfully refer to Singapore as a possible paradigm, a great naval base turned 
into a center for the manufacture of high-tech consumer goods. But the iron 
grip of the military keeps the "open" status of Vladivostok ambiguous, even 
four years after Mikhail Gorbachev's speech there promising it. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's intellectual community, there is thirst for change, a longing for 
international interactions in commerce and culture. The phrase "joint venture" 
hangs on everyone's lips. The citizens of Vladivostok respect the Japanese. Old 
Toyotas and Mazdas find appreciative new owners here. South Korea is attracting 
new admiration. But everyone wants to practice English and visit the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
World peace depends on a stable Soviet Union. It is to no one's interest to 
have that huge nation fall into economic collapse and political chaos. What can 
and should the United States do? Massive investment in the Soviet Union or even 
just in the Primorie is unfeasible. Even if we were to find and commit the 
money, the scale and complexity of the problems is too great, and not to be 
solved by anyone except the Soviet people themselves. 
</P>
<P>
What many people of the Primorie would like is the chance to study in the 
United States in order to develop a stronger sense of the entrepreneurial 
culture they perceive necessary to the success of a market economy. We should 
offer them this opportunity. American troops occupied Vladivostok for a year 
and a half at the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution, their presence 
interpreted by the Soviets as imperialist aggression. We now have the 
opportunity to erase that image. A program bringing 100 scholars a year from 
the Primorie for the next five years would cost relatively little. Yet in a 
population of only 2 million, it would create a critical mass for change and 
yield great return, both to local benefit and that of U.S.-Soviet relations.

THEY'RE RUNNING A PROTECTION RACKET; 
</P>
<P>
AZTECS: IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT, THE ORNERY BUNCH UP FRONT 
WILL BE A KEY.

<P>
OK, so San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire is a consensus choice as one of 
the best quarterbacks in the land. 
</P>
<P>
He is going to pass for thousands of yards and pass for dozens of touchdowns. 
He hopes to lead the Aztecs to a bowl game, a return to glory and an Academy 
Award. Or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McGwire, Dan McGwire, Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
So who's going to protect him? 
</P>
<P>
The short answer to that is, a group of guys whose numbers are better known 
than their names. Guys who wear the numbers of offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers such as 60 (Nick Subis), 65 (Derek Sang), 64 (Kevin Macon), 63 (Jim 
Jennings), 73 (Tony Nichols). 
</P>
<P>
You hear about McGwire and the vaunted SDSU offense. You hear about the Aztecs' 
dangerous wide receivers and talented running backs. Well, these are the guys 
in the trenches, the guys who admittedly laugh at weird things during film 
sessions and have developed a fierce loyalty to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique group," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. "Their athletic ability 
is much improved. I like offensive lines with an ornery temperament. I don't 
like offensive lines to be passive. 
</P>
<P>
"We play smash-mouth football, and you can't do that and be passive. We're 
getting close to what a good Division I offensive line is all about. Good leg 
strength, good arm strength, and we're going to average pretty good size." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE GUYS 
</P>
<P>
Three starters -- Subis, Sang and Nichols -- return from last year's offensive 
line, but none of them are in the same positions they played then. But that 
goes along with Luginbill's attitude that he wants athletes, not just big guys, 
up front on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the best 11 athletes on the field at all times, for whatever situation 
we're in," Luginbill said. "The offensive line is a skill position, it's just a 
different type of skill." 
</P>
<P>
In his search for athletes, Luginbill has two former fullbacks -- Macon and 
Jennings -- playing on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two fullbacks have proved to be pretty good," said Dave Lay, offensive 
line coach. "Maybe we need a bunch of fullbacks." 
</P>
<P>
If the season were starting tomorrow, the players lining up in front of McGwire 
would be: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle, Subis (6-feet-6, 285 pounds, senior): He has now played every 
position on the line. Two years ago he started every game at guard, last year 
he started every game at center. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the best athlete on the offensive line," Luginbill said. "He has a 
real chance to play football beyond this level if he has the type of year he's 
capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Subis missed most of spring practice with a broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard, Sang (6-5, 270, senior): He's being pushed by redshirt freshman 
Carlson Leomiti (6-4, 330), having been moved to strong guard last spring after 
playing weak guard last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek is a guy who keeps scrapping and scrapping and finds ways to block you," 
Luginbill said. "Carlson is probably the better athlete, but Derek has the 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center, Macon (6-3, 260, junior): He played fullback his first two seasons 
here but was moved to center last spring, and impressed the coaches as one of 
the most improved players during spring practice. He's being pushed by Bonner 
Montler (6-2, 250). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard, Jennings (6-4, 270, junior): Like Macon, he came to SDSU as a 
fullback but was moved to the line when Luginbill installed the one-back 
offense, eliminating the fullback position. He played quite a bit as a reserve 
guard last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting better with experience," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle, Nichols (6-5, 275, sophomore): He started the first nine games at 
tackle last season as a redshirt freshman before missing the final three games 
with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Judd Rachow (6-6, 265, junior), meanwhile, will swing between strong- and 
weak-side tackle. Redshirt freshman Chris Rodahoffer (6-5, 235) had nearly 
earned some playing time, too, but he fractured an ankle in practice Tuesday 
and will be out at least four to six weeks. That means sophomore Joe Heinz 
(6-3, 285) and redshirt freshman Bob Shults (6-4, 240) may also get more looks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a chance to be a really good offensive line," Lay said. "We 
have good athletes, pretty good size and strength and good movement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT THEY THINK OF THEIR JOBS 
</P>
<P>
The two who have converted from fullback -- Macon and Jennings -- both say they 
are still adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more difficult than fullback, dealing with different schemes," 
Macon said. "Especially at center, calling what schemes the defense is in." 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said the most difficult part of the transition has been learning to 
pass-block. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still my biggest fault," he said. "I feel more confident as a player, but 
I still will have mental breakdowns. Physically, I know I can get the job done, 
but if I you do one thing wrong, you can get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jennings doesn't have any illusions of returning to fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself an offensive lineman now," he said. "I'm about 40 pounds 
away from playing fullback." 
</P>
<P>
Because of SDSU's quick-passing game, Aztec offensive linemen have to be 
equally adept at both pass and run blocking. They need to be able to fire off 
the line of scrimmage during a run or back off a little bit and form a pocket 
when McGwire passes. This is why SDSU coaches want "athletes" up front. 
</P>
<P>
"They all pull, they all trap, they all pass block," Lay said. "They don't just 
line up and drive back or pass block the whole game. They've got to have 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not into the stereotype where linemen are passive. We want aggressive, 
maybe defensive-minded guys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN 
</P>
<P>
The ability to be different. On offense, the quarterback, running backs and 
receivers all get to play with the football. On defense, everyone gets a chance 
to tackle the person with the football. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive linemen rarely get to see the football. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensive linemen have to have the ability to take suffering and make 
something good out of it," Luginbill said. "Our offensive linemen are ornery -- 
they don't like getting stuffed. I like our mentality. We've got a toughness." 
</P>
<P>
Why do they have to make something good out of suffering? 
</P>
<P>
"Because they get their heads beat in constantly," Luginbill said. "They've got 
to come off the ball and smack somebody right in the mouth. That's the only way 
they get to enjoy football. Pass protection is not the fun part. They like to 
lay their ears back, come off the ball and smack somebody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SO WHAT EXACTLY DO OFFENSIVE LINEMEN ENJOY? 
</P>
<P>
"All of the interesting people you meet," Subis said. 
</P>
<P>
No, really. 
</P>
<P>
"Flatbacks," Rachow said. 
</P>
<P>
Flatbacks? 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line takes pride in flatbacks -- knocking the other guy over," 
Rachow said. "And stoning people on the line -- stopping their penetration." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of things offensive linemen get a kick out of, and some of 
this amuses them during film sessions. When someone misses a block on film, 
that person can usually expect to see the other linemen looking over at him, 
eyes piercing the darkness, smirking. 
</P>
<P>
This group's most memorable moment in a film session, so far, came last year 
after the Hawaii game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaii runs a different kind of defense -- there doesn't seem to be any kind 
of logic to it," Sang said. "We changed some blocking schemes, and Nick was 
asked to block two guys at one time." 
</P>
<P>
So during the film session, after one play during which Subis didn't carry out 
his assignment to former offensive line coach Steve Devine's satisfaction, 
Devine got after Subis. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, frustrated, Subis said: "What the hell do you want me to do, jump up 
and do a backflip?" 
</P>
<P>
They still use that one on each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANYTHING ELSE? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing this sport for 13 years," Subis said. "I get joy out of not 
getting beat. If I get beat once or twice in practice, I feel the day is shot." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sang: "I enjoy frustrating the hell out of people. If there is any joy, it 
is that the one guy in front of you wants to go somewhere, and you stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy beats you two out of 80 plays, he's the hero and you're the goat. 
Your goal is to make sure he doesn't make it onto the front pages. You're 
usually going against a headliner, and you have to keep the big names off the 
front page." 
</P>
<P>
And, on the other hand, Sang and his teammates want to keep at least a couple 
of their own headliners on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sang: "I want to see Dan McGwire in the paper 10 times this year throwing 
for 500 yards." 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, maybe Sang will jump up and do a backflip. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Steve Matuszewicz, who sprained an ankle in SDSU's scrimmage 
Wednesday, will miss the season opener Sept. 8 in Oregon. He is expected to be 
out seven to 10 days. . . . Running backs T.C. Wright (shoulder) and Curtis 
Butts (hip) were held out of practice Thursday. . . . SDSU Coach Al Luginbill 
said he hopes linebacker Lou Foster (hamstring) and defensive back Zac Stokes 
(shoulder) will return Monday. . . . Linebacker Tyrone Morrison and defensive 
back Darrell Lewis, who transferred to SDSU after quitting the Ohio State team 
last week, practiced for the first time with the Aztecs. Both were used on the 
Oregon "look" team. Neither is eligible to play for SDSU until next season.

SADNESS, TENSION, BAD FEELINGS -- AND THEN A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the managing of Dick Williams, the Padres won their first and only 
National League championship in 1984. He tells of his Padre years in his 
soon-to-be-released autobiography, "No More Mr. Nice Guy," written with Times 
Staff Writer Bill Plaschke. The Padre chapter is called "McNightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 With my talented but unusual team intact, our 1984 year began on a down note 
when owner Ray Kroc died on Jan. 14. He had been sick, and his death was not 
unexpected, but it still shook those who knew him as a man who both loved and 
respected the game and its importance in society. 
</P>
<P>
He had bought the team in 1974 when it was moments away from being moved to 
Washington, D.C. He put his bleep on the line then, and he kept it on the line 
every day by promising that his players would try -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
As complacency swept through the game, he became angry. Like me. Ray Kroc and I 
thought alike and cared alike. 
</P>
<P>
True to my history, the more we won, the more I expected us to win. The safer 
we were in first place, the more I demanded and the tougher I grew. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to return was my temper. Not that it had ever left, but true to 
my pennant race personality, I exchanged "mad" for "fighting mad." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing illustrates that more than what happened Aug. 12, a Sunday afternoon in 
Atlanta. Sickos will remember it as a day when baseball became a war game, 
pitchers became gladiators, batters became targets, and one manager was tagged 
as evil. 
</P>
<P>
In our Saturday night game, Alan Wiggins had bunted twice for base hits, which 
the Braves thought was rubbing it in. Wiggins came to the plate to start the 
Sunday game, and Pascual Perez's first pitch hit Wiggins in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Rule Number One: If a pitcher is trying to hit you, he throws directly behind 
your back. 
</P>
<P>
Rule Number Two: When Rule Number One is in effect, get the guy. In this case, 
Perez. 
</P>
<P>
And so before my team took the field, I said loudly, "We know what we've got to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
It ended in a 5-3 Braves victory, but most will remember two brawls, three hit 
batters, five arrests of fans, eight brushback pitches and 16 ejections. 
</P>
<P>
I've been sorry for many things in my career, but my only regret about that 
"Battle of Atlanta" was that Atlanta Manager Joe Torre ended up looking like 
the good guy. 
</P>
<P>
This was cemented a couple of days later, when Ballard and McKeon informed me 
about my $10,000 fine and 10-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"Both managers got the same punishment?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, no," Ballard said. "Torre only got three days and $3,000." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, while I didn't drink as much as in previous pennant races, it was 
worse because this time my so-called notoriety placed me in the public eye. 
This led to one problem that was made public and blown out of proportion. It 
may even have helped cost me my job. 
</P>
<P>
We played in Houston on a Saturday afternoon, and I ended up walking into our 
hotel bar before dinner. Among others sitting on a stool laughing and joking 
was Carmelo Martinez, our young outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you'd hit better than .237 if you didn't spend time down here," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, I know, it came out sarcastic. Martinez brushed me off with a wave of the 
hand, which at that point was like waving a red blanket at a bull. I repeated 
it again and again until Martinez stood up as if to challenge me. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness my coaches pulled me away. I wanted to anger Martinez, but not 
past the point of common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Norma received a phone call at home. It was from my 
favorite club president, Ballard Smith. Here is how she recalled the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to tell Dick he has to stop drinking," Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
She answered Ballard as much in confusion as in anger. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I tell him to stop drinking if I never see him drink?" she asked. "I 
know when he's drinking too much. I've gone through hell with it. But this is 
not one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
Before a stunned Ballard could get in another word, Norma added a final 
rejoinder: "If I told Dick that you called, he'd quit on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the phone there was silence. Norma said it was then that 
she knew that was exactly what Ballard Smith wanted. He wanted me gone. 
</P>
<P>
Later, we found out it was so he could give the job to Jack McKeon. Why would 
McKeon want my job? And in the middle of a pennant race? The longer I was 
there, the clearer it became. As anybody who's ever bought a "Trader Jack" 
baseball cap will attest, the man has a stadium-sized ego. 
</P>
<P>
The race finally ended on Sept. 20. We beat the San Francisco Giants in the 
afternoon and then went to Goose Gossage's house and waited for Houston to lose 
to the Dodgers that night. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, amid the tension and bad feelings and everything else that pops up 
during six months of devoting everything to victory, we were able to relax. And 
how. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc walked in that night and shouted, "Well, dammit! We did it, didn't 
we? Dammit!" 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the splashing started, Jack McKeon actually left the party and sat 
in his car. It was truly unusual behavior for someone who turned out to be a 
shark. 
</P>
<P>
All told, it was quite a night. 
</P>

<P>
LOYOLA'S WESTHEAD IS EAGER TO CZECH OUT HIS 6-FOOT-10 CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big question facing the Loyola Marymount basketball team after losing its 
starting front line -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Per Stumer -- was where the 
power and rebounding were going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
The big answer Czeched into campus this week when 6-foot-10 Czechoslovakian 
National Team center Richard Petruska started classes. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody really knows what Petruska can do for the Lions. He wasn't a standout on 
the Czech team and he has never played in a run-and-gun system like Coach Paul 
Westhead's. As the Loyola coach wryly noted, "He has to make a double 
transition -- just playing U.S. college style basketball, and playing Loyola 
outer space-style basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chris Knight's play in the NCAA Tournament was promising, the 6-9 
junior remains an unproven talent. The other returning front-line players, 6-7 
junior John O'Connell and 6-8 sophomore Chris Scott, are too small to defend 
imposing centers. In the coming season, the Lions will face the likes of 7-1 
Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State and 7-1 Ron Reis of Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
So at 6-10 and a self-professed 220 pounds, Petruska can be a physical force 
under the basket. Two years ago, when the Czechs played Loyola in an exhibition 
game, Petruska made 15 of 17 shots and scored 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a low-post player," assistant coach Jay Hillock said. "We think he can 
score points. He's not cat-quick like Hank, but we think he can be an impact 
player in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Petruska is believed to be the first Czechoslovakian player to play for an 
American college. The 21-year-old, who has friends in Fullerton and was looking 
to attend a California school, appeared headed to UCLA until Ed O'Bannon left 
Nevada Las Vegas and enrolled at Westwood. Petruska then turned to Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"When he told friends and relatives he was thinking about coming here, people 
in Czechoslovakia knew of our running game," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Leuice, Czechoslovakia, the left-handed Petruska played three 
seasons with the Czech team, making two U.S. college tours. His favorite stop 
was Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Petruska, who was cleared by admissions last week although he doesn't speak 
fluent English, has an idea of what Loyola's offense is about. "We run," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He will room with senior Tom Peabody and figures to pick up beach slang -- and 
probably assorted bumps and bruises -- quickly. He might even learn to "Hang 
10." 
</P>
<P>
If he can hang 18 or 20 points a night, grab rebounds and keep up with the 
fast-break style, Petruska might be the big man Loyola lacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's bigger than we've been able to recruit," Westhead said. "We look to him 
as a player who can help us right away. His performance against us two seasons 
ago gives a pretty good indication of what he can do in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Before Hank Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding, Loyola 
centers in the 1980s were tall, but failed to make a major contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lahm, a 7-footer who weighed less than 200 pounds, had problems holding 
his own under the boards and transferred after two seasons to Murray State, 
where he ended up having a productive career. Leonard Agee, a 6-10 standout at 
Hawthorne High, added some offense punch but played only one season. Larry 
Irwin, at 7-2 the tallest player ever at Loyola, played two seasons without a 
notable contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' best big man in recent years was 6-10 John Veargason, who capably 
backed up Gathers when the team won the West Coast Conference Tournament went 
to the NCAA Regionals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Cano is calling this a rebuilding year, but his counterparts around the 
country apparently have faith in the Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer coach. In 
the first Division II poll of the Intercollegiate Soccer Assn. of America, the 
Lady Toros are tied for second with North Carolina-Greensboro. The top-ranked 
team is another traditional power, Barry University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the top 10 are Dominguez Hills' perennial rivals Sonoma State (sixth) 
and Cal State Hayward (seventh). 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills men's and women's teams open the season at home on Saturday 
against San Diego State. The women play at 1 p.m., and the men at 3 p.m. The 
San Diego State men's team is rated 20th in Division I. The Dominguez Hills men 
are unranked. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Loyola Marymount volleyball Coach Steve Stratos said having 
assistants take over some coaching responsibilities has been a new -- and not 
entirely comfortable -- experience. Stratos, who has previously coached on the 
high school and club level, is Loyola's first full-time volleyball coach and is 
assisted by Larry Smoot and graduate assistant Pam Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed you have to do everything yourself if you wanted it done 
right," Stratos said. "It's tough (for me) to delegate authority, but they've 
done such a good job I can step back, oversee things, step in when I see 
something and not actually get involved in every drill. I never trusted anyone 
enough before to do that."

BASEBALL: PROSPECTS GET A CHANCE TO SHOW THEIR STUFF WITH MAJOR LEAGUE TEAMS.

<P>
For some minor league baseball players, Sept. 1 can be as exciting as Christmas 
morning. Starting today, major league teams can expand their rosters to 40 
players and a few select minor leaguers will be rewarded with promotions. 
</P>
<P>
Pennant contenders, such as the Dodgers and the New York Mets, will be adding 
reserves to help the battle for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams will use their additional roster spots to test their top prospects 
against major league competition. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Chris Donnels (South Torrance High, Loyola Marymount), catcher 
Kelly Mann (Culver City), outfielder Brad Bierley (Rolling Hills), third 
baseman Joe Redfield (Miraleste) and outfielder Eric Bullock (Harbor College) 
are among the minor leaguers from the South Bay-area who might be promoted. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets need a replacement for shortstop Kevin Elster, who will miss 
the remainder of the season because of tendinitis in his right shoulder. Elster 
was placed on the disabled list Wednesday and will undergo surgery next week. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson recently replaced Elster at shortstop and the Mets have rotated 
journeyman Tom O'Malley and Gregg Jeffries at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Donnels, who began the season on the New York's 40-man roster, had 10 home runs 
and 11 stolen bases for the Jackson (Miss.) Mets in double-A. 
</P>
<P>
Despite consistently hitting below .200 for the Richmond Braves in triple-A, 
Mann has the defensive skills to become a top catcher in the major leagues. The 
Braves need a replacement for veteran Ernie Whitt, the free agent who flopped 
after signing a multi-year contract with the team in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock (Indianapolis), Bierley (Iowa) and Redfield (Denver) had good seasons 
at the triple-A level and might be called up by the Montreal Expos, Chicago 
Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock earned the distinction as the first South Bay-area player to be called 
up this season when he replaced veteran outfielder Tim Raines on the Expos' 
roster in June. 
</P>
<P>
Although veteran outfielder Kal Daniels has been hampered by back pains, it's 
doubtful the Dodgers will promote Billy Bean despite the fact the former Loyola 
Marymount standout has been hitting close to .300 for the Albuquerque Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
An award-winning week -- For the second consecutive week, a third baseman from 
the South Bay has been honored as Player of the Week by Howe Sportsdata 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Berry, the former West Torrance standout, was honored this week as the top 
hitter in the Southern League (double-A). Berry went 10 for 22, including three 
doubles and a home run for the Memphis (Tenn.) Chicks. He scored four runs and 
had 10 runs batted in. He had a batting average of .455 and slugging percentage 
of .727. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ken Pennington (El Camino College) was selected the top hitter in 
the Eastern League. 
</P>
<P>
Pennington had 10 hits, including two home runs and seven RBIs for the 
Williamsport (Penn.) Bills, a double-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. He 
raised his batting average from .244 to .257. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle considers Pennington its third baseman of the future. The Mariners 
traded veteran third baseman Jim Presley to Atlanta for Pennington and pitcher 
Gary Eave during the off-season. Eave was later dealt to the San Francisco 
Giants for pitcher Russ Swan. 
</P>
<P>
Still a star -- San Jose Giants shortstop Royce Clayton (St. Bernard) was 
selected to the 1990 California League All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas pitcher Steve Maye, who lead the league in complete games; second 
baseman Brian Turang (Loyola Marymount), and outfielder Dan Lewis (El Camino) 
received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
California League managers also picked the best players for 21 hitting and 
pitching categories. Clayton earned the most honors for South Bay players, 
being selected as the infielder with the best arm and best defensive shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Davis (Cal State Dominguez Hills) finished in a tie for second as the best 
fielding pitcher and Turang received votes for being best defensive second 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, along with Turang and Lewis, were also nominated as most improved 
player.

ELBOW ROOM FOR FANN'S FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some athletes wear their emotions on their sleeve. Albert Fann, Cal State 
Northridge's All-American tailback, wears them on his elbow pads. 
</P>
<P>
Fann printed the initials T. A., T. G. and K. L., then added an R. I. P. below. 
They stand for Tracy Anderson, Tom Gray and Ken Lesure, all former Northridge 
teammates who have died within the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a senior linebacker, was gunned down on the streets of Pacoima, in 
September, 1988. Gray, a nose tackle, died of a heart ailment last December. 
Lesure was killed this summer in an accident on the Harbor Freeway. He had 
pulled to the side of the road to help a stranded motorist and was struck by a 
hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my own little tribute to those guys," Fann said. "They were all great 
people." 
</P>
<P>
What's in a name: The Moorpark College football team is 39-12 the past five 
seasons and was 9-2 and won the Western State Conference championship last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Coach Jim Bittner apparently isn't known well enough in the college's 
athletic department to have his name spelled correctly. 
</P>
<P>
When the school's sports information office issued a release this week 
previewing the 1990 team, Bittner's last name was misspelled -- "Bitner" -- six 
times. In two other instances the second 't' was written in. 
</P>
<P>
However, the coach shouldn't feel too badly. Freddie Bradley, the Raiders' 
All-American tailback, had his first name spelled "Freddy." All Bradley did 
last season was rush for 1,266 yards and score 23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Highly touted: Three Valley-area football teams are in the JC Athletic Bureau 
preseason Top 20. Moorpark (9-2 last season) is ranked sixth; Glendale (5-4-1) 
is 19th and Ventura (7-4) is 20th. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau picked Moorpark 11th nationally. Moorpark, at No. 9, is the only 
area team in Cal-Hi Sports Magazine's state Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Home from the range: Bob Shoup might have taken a sabbatical from Cal Lutheran, 
but he has not taken a sabbatical from football. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, the former Cal Lutheran coach, spent several weeks in the spring working 
as a volunteer coach with the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a really enjoyable experience for me," said Shoup, who handled the 
specialists, outside linebackers and defensive backs during spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
Champion assistant: It is somewhat fitting that Cal State Northridge women's 
volleyball Coach Walt Ker would hire a Division I veteran in conjunction with 
the team's move to Division I. The "vet," Mora Kanim, played on UCLA's 1984 
national championship team and served as a Bruin graduate assistant in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The past three years she coached at Marymount High in Los Angeles and in the 
Zuma Bay U.S. Volleyball Assn. club program. 
</P>
<P>
Kanim, and assistants Angela Brinton-Collins and Anna Garcia, both former CSUN 
stars, will be relied on heavily for scouting this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every opponent will be scouted or videotaped," Ker said. "I didn't have to 
rely on scouting reports in Division II because we played the teams so many 
times that I knew every team's idiosyncrasies. As for Division I, I see the 
Final Four every year, but I don't know the teams after that." 
</P>
<P>
No bull: The Pierce College football program appears to be on the rise after 
posting 1-9 and 4-6 records the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be a whole lot better this year," Coach Bob Enger said. Enger 
was hired two years ago when Pierce revived its program after a two-year hiatus 
brought on by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"If this year's team were to play last year's, we'd be in for a nice field day. 
. . . We expect to be in contention (for the division title) this year." 
</P>
<P>
Enger's biggest goal, however, is to post a winning record. If the Brahmas can 
do that, he figures Pierce will start to land the quality players who have 
opted to play for other local schools in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Success breeds success," he said. "If we start winning again, the good players 
will want to come here. . . . Right now, we feel like there are two Pierces. 
One (in Woodland Hills) and one in (Moorpark)." 
</P>
<P>
Enger's reference to Moorpark might have some validity -- the Raiders have 21 
players from San Fernando Valley high schools on this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
Losing the edge: Although Pierce holds an 11-2 series lead against Moorpark, 
the Brahmas have been outscored, 106-20, in the past two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's most recent victory over Moorpark was a 27-14 win in the 1985 Brahma 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Macho mascot: Antelope Valley College has adopted a new "hard body" mascot to 
exemplify what the school believes is the desert dwelling-type of marauder the 
nickname is based upon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new mascot is only a logo and the flouncing fuzzball of a parrot 
(for pirate-type marauders) previously seen frolicking at Antelope Valley 
athletic events still will be on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the previous mascot's uniform, a duck suit, reportedly was 
blown up by the cannon that is shot when the football team scores. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Lee and staff writers Mike Hiserman, John Ortega, Brendan Healey and 
Theresa Munoz contributed to this notebook.

CHARGERS' BOTTOM LINE: SPENCER'S VERSATILITY MIGHT COST HIM JOB 
</P>

<P>
As football has grown more complicated, so has the market for players who can 
meet its needs. That's good news for specialists but bad news for players who 
have the ability to contribute in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the Chargers' workout Thursday at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium, Coach Dan Henning addressed the plight of a veteran player who is a 
shining example of this but whose football light may soon be snuffed out. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Spencer is described in the 1990 media guide as the Chargers' most 
experience runner and blocker. In 1989, Spencer rushed for 521 yards on 134 
carries, second only to Marion Butts. 
</P>
<P>
But his position is endangered; 13 players must go by Tuesday, the NFL's 
deadline to get rosters down to 47. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he would be disappointed if the Chargers do let go of Spencer, a 
six-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"I would miss him," he said, "but it would be based on other people are capable 
of doing what he can do, and he just gets caught in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Spencer, who started at running back for part of last season, then 
started at H-back for the last game, would have had a better chance if they had 
to cut a total of 27 players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy that was very valuable to us last year in a number of areas," 
Henning said. "If we had to go to a 33-man roster, Tim Spencer would have a 
better chance of making this team than five or six other guys that have a 
chance now because we're at 47. 
</P>
<P>
With specialization, Henning said, you are constantly putting in new players 
for specific purposes, diminishing the need for a player with Spencer's 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim is a very complete type of football player," Henning said, "but there are 
some other people in his area that do some specialized things better than he 
does any one individually, so, at the 47-man squad, he can be a very valuable 
guy to us or he might slip through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five years ago, Henning said, Spencer would have been invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have about 14 players on offense, 14 defensive players, a couple of 
kickers, a few spares, and you get more into a homogeneous type of offense and 
defense game plan, the way it was 45 years ago. . . . A a guy doing as much as 
Tim does would become doubly valuable as you go down in numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Arthur Cox, nose tackle Les Miller, tackles Joel Patten and Leo Goeas 
and guard/tackle Broderick Thompson aren't injured and will miss Saturday's 
final exhibition game Saturday against the Raiders . . . Coach Dan Henning said 
the exhibition season is too long and should be whittled down from four to 
three games. "It's a serious pain in the (tail). The way it ought to be is play 
three games and give you two weeks before the season. Everyone's worried about 
who's going to be where, when and whether they're going to make the team. 
Legitimately you're talking about letting 13 guys go, but that doesn't mean 13 
guys are uptight, because 26 don't know whether they're one of the 13, so you 
have almost 40% of the team worried about where they're going to be Tuesday."

LEAGUE'S FIRST FAVORITE? ST. AUGUSTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fret not, little Harbor League. The sun is shining in your small corner of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
So many things are happening so quickly for you. Just think, you are about to 
celebrate your first birthday, you are playing football for the very first 
time, and dear but departed Tony Clark is an entire time zone away. 
</P>
<P>
Due to circumstances beyond its control, the Harbor League was so closely 
linked to Clark last year -- he is now splitting his time playing basketball at 
Arizona and baseball in the Detroit Tiger organization -- that it suffered a 
bit of an identity crisis. With Clark leading Christian High to second in the 
state in Division IV basketball and becoming the second player taken in the 
baseball draft, the Harbor was little more than a showcase for his talents. 
</P>
<P>
But he never played a down of football, and the line of opportunity forms here 
as schools attempt to make a name other than "Clark" for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine would like to be the first to do so, and barring an extraordinary 
turn of events, the Saints will hang the Harbor's first football championship 
banner in its gym. There are few measuring sticks on which to base this 
prediction other than an overwhelming thumbs-up endorsement by the leagues' 
five coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the front-runner, no doubt," said Bud Mayfield, second-year coach at 
Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dale Peterson, in his first year at Christian: "You would think Saints is 
the favorite. Marty placed a lot of kids in college last year." 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine finished the 1989 season tied for third in a strong Central 
League, won by Crawford -- which it defeated in regular season -- and Lincoln. 
And in the San Diego Section 2-A playoffs, the Saints defeated Kearny in the 
quarterfinals before losing to San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
"People are judging us on our ability to beat Kearny and Crawford," said Marty 
Martin, St. Augustine coach of three years. "That's why they're picking us. 
Based on that, it's justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
Martin is known for having a keen football mind and finding a way to win. He 
has 17 returning players, six of them starters, and his team has as many 
victories (seven) last year as the rest of the league's teams combined. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stay healthy, we should be there," Martin said. "We want to set 
realistic goals, but this is the year we should be able to win a league 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
After St. Augustine, the pecking order is a tossup. There are lots of question 
marks and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"Saints is the one to beat," Marian Coach John Pappas said. "I don't know how 
it lines up after that. Since the league is newly formed, it's hard to speak 
about the rest of the teams. No one really knows much about anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because they come from a variety of compass points. 
</P>
<P>
Christian and St. Augustine are the only schools to play in the same league 
(City Central) last year. Coronado, after shuffling between the Metro and South 
Bay leagues for several years, was independent for the 1988 and 1989 seasons. 
Marian, also forced to play in the Metro and South Bay leagues, was a guppy in 
a pool of sharks before bailing out for two years and joining the Desert 
Coastal League, in which it won the 1-A title in 1988. After years of success 
in the City Western League, falling enrollment made Clairemont a misfit, and 
the Chieftains went 13-35 from 1985-89 before changing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that some may look down their noses at the competition level of the 
Harbor League but that it's not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Some look down on the league, but we've been respectable," he said. "We can be 
as competitive as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
What the new league does, he said, is open the door for competitive schools 
that otherwise would be floundering in leagues with larger enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
"The league has created the situation that the best teams should be able to win 
a championship," Martin said. "We'd still be in the hunt in the City 
(Central)." 
</P>
<P>
While it's a start, there is still disparity. Marian's enrollment last year was 
325, Clairemont's 1,063. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy to be in the 2-A," said Pappas, who has only 40 players out 
for both varsity and junior varsity teams. "A restricted 2-A yes, but not this. 
We're not comparable to the other schools." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HARBOR LEAGUE FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion: None. The league is dipping its big toe into football for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Who should win: St. Augustine (7-5 in 1989, 3-2 in City Central League). 
</P>
<P>
Who could win: Christian (3-7, 1-4 in City Central), Coronado (1-7 as an 
independent). 
</P>
<P>
Who should look toward 1991: Clairemont (1-8, 0-5 in City Western League), 
Marian (2-8, 2-3 in Desert Coastal League). 
</P>
<P>
The Game: St. Augustine vs. Christian, Oct. 26. This may be the only game that 
could blemish an otherwise perfect league record for St. Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
Impact players: Antione Henry, Clairemont running back, 5-11, 190; his 
week-by-week performance is synonymous with Clairemont's success. Justin 
Williams, St. Augustine defensive back/wide receiver, 5-11, 190; a double 
threat who intercepts footballs as well as he catching them. Chad Tomosaski, 
St. Augustine cornerback/wide receiver, 5-11, 165; was a big reason Saints 
allowed 9.8 points a game and upset the team that allowed just 5.3 -- Crawford; 
Tony Acosta, Marian defensive back, 5-11, 165; 1-A defensive player of the year 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
New faces: Adam Smith, Coronado quarterback, 6-2, 205; broken collarbone in 
first game last season made Coronado's bad situation -- very little experience 
-- worse. Chad De Grenier, Christian quarterback, 6-2, 190; led Scottsdale 
(Ariz.) Christian to Division I state title last year. Jack De Grenier, 
Christian offensive coordinator; Chad's father is former NFL (New Orleans) and 
USFL (Chicago) player. 
</P>
<P>
Last word: These teams desperately need each other. Their combined record last 
year, often against schools with twice or three times their enrollments, was 
14-35, and St. Augustine accounted for half of those victories.

Is That U?Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who started a controversy when she 
refused to let the U.S. national anthem be played before a recent concert, 
donned a wig and duped protesters and a television reporter at a Wednesday 
night performance in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. O'Connor, whose hair is closely 
cropped, wore a brown shoulder-length wig and baseball cap as she sat outside 
the gates of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center before the show. O'Connor 
mingled for nearly an hour as a half-dozen demonstrators asked her fans to 
boycott her performance. At one point, a television reporter for WNYT in 
Albany, who did not recognize O'Connor, interviewed her for a reaction story.

Kraft a Finalist: A work by Los Angeles composer William Kraft, 66, has been 
chosen for the final round in the competition for the Kennedy Center Friedheim

No Shot in the Dark: Three fans of a British rock band performing on the 
late-night television show "Into the Night" rushed the stage during Wednesday's 
taping, prompting a security guard to draw his gun, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The entire episode was captured by video cameras and shown on the show, which 
was broadcast Wednesday night on ABC. Members of The Mission/U.K. were 
performing during the taping when three young women rushed toward the band's 
lead singer, Wayne Hussey. "The security guard pulled his gun, then a stagehand 
saw the guard pull his gun and he tackled him, saying, 'Don't shoot,' " the 
spokesman said. No shots were fired and no one was injured. BETH KLEID

'THE LEMON SISTERS' SINKS DESPITE ITS ABLE CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Lemon Sisters" (selected theaters) are three white ladies from Atlantic 
City who want to be the Supremes. Best buddies Eloise, Franki and Nola have 
gone from 1959 to 1982 in a time warp; at 31, they're still doing '60s hits in 
small-time bars. As played by Diane Keaton, Carol Kane and Kathryn Grody, this 
unrelated threesome might not be offended if you called them "girls"; that's 
what they want to be: a girl group. And their movie, a bit like "The Fabulous 
Baker Boys," wants to be a ballad for show-biz wannabes. 
</P>
<P>
In a rotten but cute world, you can always rely on your cute pals to get you 
through rotten times. They'll be there with the party, the ambulance, the 
shopping bag full of money. So says "The Lemon Sisters," and its one of those 
pearls of movie wisdom where the shiny thin shell barely covers the grain of 
sand inside. The people that made this movie -- writers Jeremy Pikser and Mo 
Gaffney and director Joyce Chopra, working from Keaton's idea -- never seem 
tight with their material. They don't empathize with these "little people." 
Secretly, they condescend, make them into butts and foils. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lemon Sisters" is set in Atlantic City, but it's a kiddie-land resort as 
far removed from the boardwalk of blighted dreams and losers that we saw in 
Louis Malle's 1980 "Atlantic City" as "Roseanne" is from "Raging Bull." That's 
not necessarily bad. "The Lemon Sisters" isn't trying for anything profound or 
poetic. But the title is a giveaway. The sisters are called "Lemons" because 
they're supposed to be awful -- and they wear their awfulness with pride. One 
is a fruitcake; the other a couch potato; the third makes taffy. 
</P>
<P>
Only the occasional monochrome flashbacks to the past -- the three little girls 
huddling under piers or playing oceanside -- have any amplitude or warmth. In 
the present, Chopra and the writers keep putting their foot on the nutty-cutie 
pedal and jamming it to the floor. The candy-colored boardwalk world, shimmery 
pink and yellow, has an oddball on every corner, hawking local color. 
Bag-ladies, hustlers, goombahs, hoods and flakes: They're all here, jostling 
like rush-hour riders on the Goofball Limited. It says something about the 
movie's attitude that the only time a "Lemon" succeeds is when she makes such a 
tangle-footed wreck of a lounge date that she's hired as a comedian. Keaton's 
character, Eloise, lives in a TV museum, full of such cherished boob-tube 
artifacts as Ralph Kramden's jacket, Davy Crockett's coonskin cap and an 
Enterprise chair from "Star Trek" -- and the movie is a TV show too, a silly 
one. In one sequence Elliott Gould, as a lovable bozo of a saltwater taffy 
concessionaire married to Grody's Nola, opens a new store with a huge, 
dumb-looking mechanical bunny outside and immediately -- that very second! -- 
he has his business destroyed when a nearby casino starts handing out free 
taffy. As Gould stares out toward the ocean with spaniel eyes, his mechanical 
rabbit keeps whomping away before his empty store, his blasted dreams. It's the 
movie's specialty: big-bunny irony. 
</P>
<P>
The lead actresses -- Keaton, Kane and Grody -- are friends in real life, and 
they obviously saw "Lemon Sisters" as a vehicle for that friendship. They're 
all good; in fact the movie's ensemble, which also includes Gould, Aidan Quinn, 
Ruben Blades and Estelle Parsons, is amazing. But "Lemon Sisters" doesn't 
create a world: It packages a cast. 
</P>
<P>
Keaton's role is a showcase for her virtuoso whining, pouting, stomping and 
neurasthenic tics; Carol Kane sails off once again into frizzy-haired 
ditz-land, and Kathryn Grody seems to be the sensible frumpy type mediating 
between her out-there buddies. That isn't a put-down. Kane is an under-used 
comic genius, and this is the kind of movie a frizzy-haired ditz can walk away 
with. That's exactly what she does: in a tie with slick-haired mensch Ruben 
Blades. 
</P>
<P>
There's a built-in self-mockery that cuts apart this whole film. It pretends to 
be on the side of losers and dreamers, then keeps snickering at them. Midway 
through, Eloise, Franki and Nola start singing "Stop! In the Name of Love," and 
Kane starts shaking and Keaton flashes her drop-you-dead grin and suddenly this 
cheek-pinching movie opens up. There's something almost insanely pleasurable 
about that performance. But, abruptly, "The Lemon Sisters" cuts it short. It's 
not about pleasure in performance; it's not even really about friendship. It's 
just a taffy-pull of self-congratulatory nostalgia, full of big-bunny irony.

STAGE BEAT / OPEN FESTIVAL: HAUNTING PORTRAIT OF EVIL IN STRINDBERG'S 'PELICAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was said that the pelican gave her own blood for her young. It's no more 
true for the bird than for the self-deceived mother Elise in August 
Strindberg's fascinating chamber play "The Pelican," surfacing in a rare 
production at 2nd Stage. Elise proclaims concern for her son and daughter while 
skimming the cream from their milk for herself, much as governments and 
corporations do. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Salome Jens understands the rapidly shifting moods and colors of 
Elise's self-made trauma and plays her as the haunting theme in a concerto of 
the damned. The play is like a piece of music and, directed by Jules Aaron in 
that manner, played out on a fantasist setting by John Iacovelli -- the 
family's home seen through a distorting mirror, as the characters are through 
Strindberg's own dark glass. 
</P>
<P>
Daughter Gerda (a not yet quite focused Sabina Weber) is late in discovering 
the true evil of Elise, as is Gerda's husband (coolly avaricious Steven 
Memell), who is also his mother-in-law's lover. But fiery alcoholic son 
Frederik (strong, volatile Chris Jordan) does not have this blind spot, nor 
does the family's longtime maid (irascible Danna Hansen). It's a nightmare they 
eventually have to share with the others as they all self-destruct in this 
imaginative staging of Strindberg's tone poem on how little evils beget large 
ones. 
</P>

Lightweight Routine in 'Somersaults' 
</P>
<P>
If there were such a thing as dinner theater in Russia, Alexsei Arbuzov's "Do 
You Turn Somersaults?" would probably be a regular menu item. Arbuzov's work is 
intimate, human and frequently funny. But definitely lightweight. Under Alison 
Jane Frazer's buoyant direction, Theatre 40's charming production couldn't have 
a better cast. 
</P>
<P>
William Denis is the self-contained, almost abrasive civil servant Rodion, 
medical director of a sanatorium in Riga. His problem is Lidya, a cashier from 
a Moscow circus who wants to be "restored." As his relationship with Lidya 
grows, so does his performance, shaded with just enough self-doubt and amused 
acquiescence to Lidya's overriding charm. 
</P>
<P>
Denis is a fine foil for June Claman's impeccable, gossamer Lidya. Hers is a 
stylish performance, from the cobweb delicacy of her high comedy to the 
unadorned pathos of her description of entertaining WWII troops near Berlin, 
unaware that her 18-year-old son has been killed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight as the play is, the performances give it some weight and not a 
little depth. 
</P>
<P>
 At 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills; Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; ends 
Sept. 19. $10; (213) 466-1767.

Getting to the Root of Charles Bukowski 
</P>
<P>
"Short Hairs &amp; Long Shots," an evening of Charles Bukowski's prose and 
poetry, conceived by Robert Villanueva, is not only for fans of the underground 
poet and writer. It's also a trip for those of us who think Bukowski usually 
reads like second-rate Saroyan with a hangover. 
</P>
<P>
He still does, but director Joanne Gordon turns LATC's Theatre 4 into the kind 
of scroungy pad Bukowski probably lived in during his less affluent days, an 
environment that lets the images ricochet off the consciousness of the audience 
as it tries to keep out of the way of the performers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pieces reflect Bukowski's fascination with his own body and libido. 
The sizable company has a ball with this fascination, in performances of dark 
color and surprising humor. 
</P>
<P>
The production is an R-rated theme-park ride for anyone who wants to wallow 
along with Bukowski in the burnt umber shadows of his perception. And for 
newcomers to Bukowski, it's a rewarding introduction by a group that gives him 
more vitality than he has on the printed page. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St.; Thursdays through Saturdays (also Sept. 16), 8 p.m.; 
ends Sept. 22. $15; (213) 466-1767.

A Skin-Deep Tribute to Dorothy Parker 
</P>
<P>
A sparkling wit, short-story writer and essayist, Dorothy Parker was also an 
alcoholic, drug-using sexaholic. But most of Parker is skimmed over in Laurel 
Ollstein's "Laughter, Hope and a Sock in the Eye" at Burbage Theatre Ensemble. 
Even her two marriages to Alan Campbell are seen through rose-colored glasses, 
not as the tortured, nightmarish traps they were for the desperate Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Ollstein, directed with froth and good cheer by Michael Keegan, has written a 
Parker tribute that looks no deeper than her most famous wisecracks, and its 
cheerful approach would be acceptable to the most bluestocking women's club. 
Parker herself would glower into her martini and crack wise at the evening's 
thinness. 
</P>
<P>

Two Uneventful Trips at Heliotrope 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these two trips at the Heliotrope Theater are "Fantastic Voyages." 
</P>
<P>
David Ellzey's "Waystation Earth" is totally earthbound, from its kid 
fantasizing winning at basketball to its audience participation jazz combo. 
Ellzey is a charming and effective mime, whose most telling pieces are a very 
clever bit about a baby going through the pangs of birth and a poetic 
visualization of the evolution of man. Nothing new here, and Ellzey's work is 
predominantly aimed at a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Rafel's "It Began in Kathmandu" is a kvetching travelogue about her 
"life-changing trip" to Nepal. From her stunned horror, Rafel probably thought 
Nepal was no more primitive than Beverly Hills south of Wilshire. She's fixated 
with the excrement in the streets, in the halls, by the wells, on the 
mountainside -- and by the public manner of her own contribution to the waste. 
The five minutes she devotes to her "life-changing" meeting with a female guru 
are unconvincing and simplistic. As the sun sets, we bid fond farewell to 
excrement-filled Nepal. 
</P>

Good Intentions at Haunted Studio 
</P>
<P>
Two one-acts by young Latino playwrights at the Haunted Studio Theater have 
good intentions, but only one of them even makes it halfway. 
</P>
<P>
The interminably long "The Taco of Death," by Bob Herrera, has a sophomorically 
comic plot concerning the kingpin of Taco Row in East L.A., who may be killing 
off his competitors. Herrera's raunchy humor is juvenile and his dialogue by 
the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
David Nava Monreal's "Cellmates," about a prisoner with a visitor who knows too 
much about his past, is little more than a cliche revisited, but fares much 
better than "Taco;" Monreal has a strong sense of character and his dialogue 
gives off sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Director William Zamora can't do much to help "Taco," and could have given a 
little more subtlety to the vivid excitement of "Cellmates," though Larry 
Acosta and David Laporte give strong performances in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6419 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; ends Sept.

CANADIAN BRASS RETURNS TO BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few people go to Harlem Globetrotters games expecting to see a real basketball 
contest. Similarly, few go to hear the Canadian Brass for the music; it's there 
simply to provide material for sight and sound gags, or for showing off the 
players' considerable virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that the show Wednesday night at Hollywood Bowl wasn't 
funny. That would be humbug. It's just to point out that these days the 
Canadian Brass, in live concert at least, is essentially a comedy group that 
performs music, not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Even what potentially could have been the musical anchor to its program, Bach's 
Toccata and Fugue in D minor, emerges not so much as great music as it does 
display piece, revealing that brass instruments can do more than most expect. 
And this most famous of brass quintets performs virtually no music originally 
written specifically for such an ensemble. Wednesday, the closest it got was 
with excerpts from Pezel's "Funf-stimmigte blasende Musik." Arrangements made 
up the entire program. 
</P>
<P>
Fine. But they are not always 100% effective. The arrangements of Mozart's 
"Rondo alla Turca" and the Queen of the Night's aria, for instance, while 
impressively played, didn't do proper justice to the music. 
</P>
<P>
The most effective arrangement of classical music turned out to be of Barber's 
Adagio, which the group performed completely straight, in a somber, smoothly 
flowing account. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, "The Tribute to the Ballet," the group's oft-repeated spoof of 
balletic conventions, complete with pas de deux, splits and a tutu, remains 
fresh and funny, as do the adept verbal introductions to each work. TIMOTHY 
MANGAN

DEPARTURE OF HOSTAGES STALLED UNTIL WEEKEND; 
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD: BRITISH WOMEN SAY THEY WERE GENERALLY TREATED WELL WHILE BEING 
SHUTTLED TO STRATEGIC SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The evacuation of hundreds of foreign women and children detained in Iraq was 
further delayed Thursday even as several dozen of the hostages provided a 
gripping inside look at their lives, shuttled between hotels and strategic 
sites throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, anger and frustration mounted two days after Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein announced that all foreign women and children could go free 
immediately. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iraq has 
imposed a series of "burdensome" new bureaucratic obstacles and paper work for 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
"This emotional roller coaster is inhumane and disgraceful," Tutwiler declared. 
</P>
<P>
But several Western diplomats in Baghdad reported that Saturday is likely to be 
the earliest departure date now and said they are confident that Hussein's 
order will be carried out once bureaucratic tie-ups over exit visas are solved. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no concern whatsoever," Joseph C. Wilson IV, charge d'affaires at the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, said. "There seems to be some confusion in the 
implementation of the president's decree. But I have every confidence that the 
government will honor the president's commitment." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials already had chartered a flight to take American hostages 
home Thursday night before Iraqi authorities informed them of the further 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
While the diplomatic controversy raged, more than 50 foreign women and children 
were permitted to meet with journalists for an hour Thursday, the first 
government-sanctioned contact between the hostages and the outside world since 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
With an outpouring of emotion ranging from joy at the prospect of freedom to 
anxiety for those who might be left behind, the hostages recalled weeks spent 
under the constant supervision of the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
All the hostages interviewed, most of whom were British, French or Japanese, 
praised the Iraqis and stressed that they had been treated well. 
</P>
<P>
Most said they had been moved frequently -- up to nine times -- between hotels 
in Baghdad and key petrochemical plants, oil refineries, fuel storage depots 
and power plants elsewhere. None said they were aware of being housed near 
chemical weapons stores. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their hourlong media appearance, it was clear that the movements of 
foreigners in Baghdad are still severely restricted. The free-for-all press 
session, at which no U.S. hostages appeared, was held on the mezzanine of 
Baghdad's Mansour Melia Hotel, which was surrounded by soldiers carrying 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Americans who remained secluded in their hotel rooms were allowed 
access to a representative of the U.S. Embassy but declined to meet with 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 foreigners are believed to be still held in Iraq and occupied 
Kuwait, including an estimated 3,000 Americans. The State Department on 
Thursday lowered its estimate of the number of private American citizens inside 
Iraq from about 500 to about 400. It said slightly more than 100 Americans of 
Iraqi descent have succeeded in leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, denied reports that 
foreign-operated planes are being required to bring in food and medicine before 
the women and children can leave Iraq. The Iraqi ambassador to the United 
States, Mohammed Mashat, also denied the reports and said, "We are working to 
expedite (the foreigners') departure." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the British Foreign Office announced that Iraq was arranging to 
evacuate some British women and children aboard Iraqi Airways at an unspecified 
time, and Virgin Atlantic Airways said it had secured Iraqi permission to pick 
up more evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
A trickle of foreigners arrived Thursday in Amman, Jordan. Among them were a 
British teen-ager of Arab origin who had been visiting family friends in 
Baghdad, a pregnant Spanish woman, a Lebanese man with a French passport and 
several Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy. I just wanted to come out," the British teen-ager, May 
Barakat, 17, told reporters as she passed through the airport immigration 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages in Baghdad told reporters that the continuing delays were 
confusing and frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind this at all," said one British woman who did not give her name. 
"I just would like somebody to tell us what's going on and when we're going 
home. . . . Somebody should be telling us something by now." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the interviews with hostages were conducted out of earshot of the many 
Iraqi Information Ministry guides who were the journalists' escorts. But the 
exercise clearly was part of Iraq's propaganda campaign to temper the world's 
opinion of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
During the sessions, the women were surprisingly forthcoming, occasionally 
critical and predictably shaken. 
</P>
<P>
One Briton, Margaret Hearn, was both conciliatory and angry when she spoke of 
her Iraqi captors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they genuinely thought we were doing some good," she said. "I think 
they were embarrassed about using us, and they did everything they could (to 
help us)." But, she added: "Of course I feel used." 
</P>
<P>
Especially effusive in her praise for Hussein was Jacqueline Blears, whose 
6-year-old daughter, Rachel, apparently helped to change the Iraqi leader's 
mind on the issue of freedom for women and children during an internationally 
televised program with the hostages Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say anything political," Blears began. She recalled that during the 
broadcast she had asked Hussein's interpreter if the cameras could focus on 
Rachel for her family back in Britain because it was her birthday, which 
Hussein himself then mentioned prominently. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Blears said, the president approached them. "It was his 
personal present to her that her, myself, my husband and son were allowed home, 
and later on it was decided that all women and children -- which is fantastic 
-- were allowed home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Blears is an exception, because she is apparently the only woman whose 
husband also has been promised freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of the others, Sheila Grosvenor's husband was not. And, in many ways, 
Grosvenor's story is poignant and typical of their long month as recipients of 
what Hussein has called "forced hospitality." 
</P>
<P>
Grosvenor was among the wives of 35 British military advisers in Kuwait working 
as the British Liaison Team to the Kuwaiti government when Iraqi troops overran 
the country Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the Iraqi army escorted all 35 officers out of the British camp, 
"and the families were left to cope on their own," Grosvenor recalled, her 
3-year-old daughter, Kayleigh, by her side. 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not see her husband again for two weeks -- and then only after 
the British wives were driven 28 hours by bus out of Kuwait to Iraq's huge oil 
refinery at Baiji, about 125 miles north-northwest of Baghdad, where all were 
reunited. For the next 11 days, she said, they stayed at the refinery and were 
well fed and cared for, along with the families of Iraqi refinery workers who 
were taken there as well. 
</P>
<P>
Grosvenor said the Britons spent long hours discussing the tense situation with 
their Iraqi counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"They were scared, too," she said of the Iraqis. "They were scared of a war as 
well. I kept telling them that I couldn't believe we would actually go to war. 
I mean, you don't believe it's really possible, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
Describing the psychological impact of her month in captivity, however pleasant 
the accommodation, Grosvenor said, "I felt all sorts of emotions. . . . I 
thought any moment we were going to die. It's a situation we've never come 
across before, and every moment we're here it's frightening, because you just 
don't know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Grosvenor and the other women remain deeply concerned about their husbands 
and other male hostages. 
</P>
<P>
And the hardest part, Grosvenor said, was being reunited only briefly before 
being separated again so the wives could be taken to the Baghdad hotel 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the cruelest part, to reunite us for just 11 days and then split us 
up again," she said, her voice beginning to crack. "I mean, the children can't 
understand why their daddy is not coming home with us." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said the new requirements for the hostages' exit 
include a personal letter from each foreign woman stating that she wants to 
leave Iraq. The letter must then be translated into Arabic and must have a 
stamp on it showing that all Iraqi taxes have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler acknowledged that these may be the usual exit requirements for leaving 
Iraq and may be imposed in some other countries as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "These are not normal circumstances. These people have not 
been held for three weeks in normal circumstances. I would think that the 
decent thing to do . . . is to waive the routine, normal bureaucratic 
processes, not create new ones." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials also have implied that the foreign women and children in Kuwait 
might have to make the long trip to Baghdad before they are allowed to leave 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said one reason the United States objects so 
strongly to the Iraqi exit requirements is that officials fear some women or 
children will be placed in a position where Iraqi officials could force them to 
disclose the whereabouts of their husbands or fathers.

SUMMER NIGHTMARE NEARS END IN BEACH COMMUNITIES;

PARKING: FIERCE COMPETITION EVERY YEAR FOR TOO FEW SPACES LEAVES RESIDENTS AND 
VACATIONERS HOT AND BOTHERED.

Louise Lyons has been around the block a few times. 
</P>
<P>
At 62, she is the matriarch of meter maids in Manhattan Beach. It is her job to 
prepare recruits for the kind of interaction they will have with citizens when 
the seaside community swells with summer tourists. 
</P>
<P>
On her Cushman scooter, she leads them to a remote part of town in the quiet 
hills above Santa Monica Bay. There, she plays the part of a Manhattan Beach 
resident upset about a parking ticket. For her performance, Lyons draws on a 
decade of experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a resident!" she screams at the rookie meter maids. "I'm a taxpayer! I pay 
your salary! Don't you have anything better to do? Why don't you get a new 
job?" She spares them the obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
"I push them just about as far as I can push," she says of the exercise. 
"Sometimes it shakes them up pretty good. But you have to be able to take it 
because, in this job, you are going to be verbally pounced on and ripped up." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons and her beleaguered troops bear the brunt of a problem that emerges every 
summer as the single hottest issue in oceanfront enclaves throughout Southern 
California -- too many cars, not enough spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians have campaigned on the parking issue. Police say it is their 
biggest headache. Towing companies have made money off it. Communities up and 
down the coast have come to depend on the hundreds of thousands of dollars they 
reap in parking fines to subsidize their municipal governments. 
</P>
<P>
For want of a good parking spot -- or even a bad one -- neighbors battle 
neighbors. Exasperated tourists, their cars crammed with cranky kids, succumb 
to temptation and park in red zones, in handicapped spaces and even in 
strangers' garages. For them, a parking ticket is a fair price for family 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people just lose their brains," says Manhattan Beach resident Ken 
Sigler, adding that his own experience on the front lines has taught him this: 
Nothing erases chalk marks on tires better than rubber thongs. "They leave 
absolutely no trace," he promises. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the parking wars are communities where homes are densely 
clustered at the edge of the sand -- as they are in the South Bay, Newport 
Beach and San Diego's Mission Beach. In these areas, locals are forced to vie 
with inlanders and each other for a piece of the curb. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rite of summer that no one likes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the season's traditional opening on Memorial Day, beach locals have been 
counting the weeks, the days and now finally the hours until its official close 
this Labor Day weekend, after which the tourists vanish, life mellows and 
residents do not have to arrange their schedules around the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Bradley, for one, can't wait. He rents a place on the Balboa Peninsula in 
Newport Beach, a six-mile-long mecca for vacationers and throngs of Orange 
County teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sucks," he says of the peninsula's recurring parking nightmare. In 
fact, the 20-year-old Bradley says he had been fuming over the problem all 
morning -- ever since paying $300 in delinquent parking tickets to reclaim his 
Honda from a tow yard. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Market owner Sam Hammad sells a popular T-shirt that seems tailor-made 
for Bradley, one that illustrates how emotionally charged the parking issue has 
become in the wealthy community, where police wrote nearly 34,000 tickets last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
On the shirt's front are a pair of muscular hands wrapped tightly around the 
neck of a bedraggled meter maid ticketing a car. "Welcome to Newport Beach," it 
says. On the back is the likeness of a Newport parking citation with a red 
slash through it and the words, "$29 for a Parking Ticket Is a Crime." 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, Hammad himself could be called a discounter. He charges only 
$20 to park on his store's lot when evening cruisers and sightseers bring 
traffic on the narrow peninsula to a virtual halt. 
</P>
<P>
Trudy Truelock and her family, who spend a month every summer vacationing in 
Newport, have learned over the years to run for cover when the street sweeper 
comes rumbling through. Inevitably, she says, it is followed by a parade of 
cars that, once the sweeper passes, race for the empty curb. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a zoo," Truelock says of the weekly spectacle. "They (drivers) almost run 
overkids. They'll yell, 'Hey, that's my spot!' People are absolutely rude to 
each other. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
In Newport, as in other beach cities, parking is a political hot potato. On one 
side are businesses that want more parking to accommodate more customers. On 
the other are residents with big homes and garages who fear that additional 
parking will mean more congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"As a police department, we're stuck in the middle," complains Lt. Tim Newman. 
"We're literally pulled because you have competing interests. What's good for 
business seems to be bad for residents. . . . Who do we listen to?" 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has struggled for remedies, it seems that in the end, most 
everyone reaches the conclusion of "Uncle" Charlie Bauman, president of the 
Balboa Improvement Assn. "I don't think there's a solution," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Down the coast in San Diego's crowded Mission Beach, the story is similar. 
Consider this statistic: on the Fourth of July, the city towed a staggering 
200-plus cars off Mission Beach streets. That's how tough it was to find a 
legal parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bell, a Mission Beach resident for 15 years, says the parking crunch 
creates "high tension" in the neighborhood, causing the most laid-back locals 
to lose control -- especially when brazen beachgoers block or park in their 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen people let air out of tires. I've seen them scratch, kick and throw 
stuff at cars," he says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Bell says he still remembers the peeved look on his wife's face the day he kept 
her waiting at San Diego's Lindberg Field. "She was not happy," he recalls, 
"and neither was I." 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't seen her for two months," Bell explains. "My only assignment that 
morning was to be at the airport to pick her up. I went outside and someone had 
blocked my garage.After I kicked the car a couple times, I got some friends 
together and we bounced it clear out into the alley." 
</P>
<P>
John Wiggins, who lived in Mission Beach for six years, says he misses the 
coast but not the cost. A bartender, he says he racked up $4,000 in parking 
tickets in his last two years there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get home at 2 or 3 in the morning and I wasn't about to walk a mile home 
from the nearest parking spot, so I parked in the red," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As bad as it is, residents fear parking is going to become even scarcer now 
that Mission Beach's Belmont Park has been commercially developed and its 
historic Big Dipper roller coaster is running again for the first time in more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Despite overwhelming community opposition, the City Council approved the park's 
redevelopment and the coaster's refurbishing because, as Councilman Bruce 
Henderson put it, "the right to ride the coaster is the birthright of every San 
Diego child." 
</P>
<P>
Up north in the South Bay, the Hermosa Beach City Council faced a near 
insurrection over its parking enforcement policies. 
</P>
<P>
To cool things off, the council adopted a resolution that, if put before 
motorists of every traffic-clogged city in Southern California, would probably 
pass with nary a dissenting vote. The council empowered parking enforcement 
officers to cancel tickets on the spot -- even after they've been tucked under 
the wiper. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone has a good excuse, the parking person can void the ticket, smile 
and say, 'Have a good day,' " explains Councilman Robert Essertier, who was 
elected on a promise to make parking officers more friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose a little revenue and people feel more positive about their city, 
then I think it is well worth it," says the 41-year-old councilman, adding that 
roughly 10% of the city's parking citations are voided at curbside. Last year, 
Hermosa police wrote about 83,300 parking tickets, more than one-third of them 
during the three months of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Essertier understands well the economics of the parking issue. He recently 
remodeled his Hermosa Beach home and adjacent rental property to boost their 
value. He added a bedroom, a bathroom and, most important, expanded the garage 
to hold 11 cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Parking," he says, "has a tremendous value to people in this real estate 
market." 
</P>
<P>
In Hermosa, residents can purchase an annual permit for $25 that lets them park 
free at designated meters, if any free meters can be found. The permits are so 
treasured that, perhaps inevitably, they are stolen and counterfeited. Parking 
officials say one forger was hawking excellent replicas for $20 apiece at 
neighborhood bars. 
</P>
<P>
While the politics and logistics of parking vary from beach to beach, meter 
maids will tell you that when it comes to a ticket, human nature is the same 
everywhere. People get mad. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times when I just wanted to haul off and hit someone square in 
the mouth," says meter maid boss Lyons of Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, she recently cited a driver for parking in the wrong 
direction. He complained to police, and Lyons was dispatched to his house. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a discussion but I refused to void the citation," she says. "When he 
finally accepted that fact, he just took the cup of coffee he was holding and 
threw it on me. It went all down the front of my slacks and down my shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"For a couple of seconds, I was just totally blank." 
</P>
<P>
She filed a complaint with police, forcing the man to hire an attorney and 
appear before a hearing officer. At that point, Lyons says, she dropped the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have requested a trial but I figured I had gone as far as I wanted to 
go," she says. "I made my point. I very definitely made my point." 
</P>

<P>
BMW now sells a car for just under $20,000. L'Ermitage Restaurant in West Los 
Angeles has added a $15 entree to its menu of high-priced French cuisine. The 
five-star Wigwam Resort in Arizona is offering $59-a-night rooms. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
America's debt-pinched upper-middle class is starting to think twice about 
splurging on luxuries, and some marketers who raked in business from 
free-spending baby boomers during the 1980s are cutting prices and scrambling 
to keep the money flowing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, signs of a slowdown in luxury buying are not yet as common as gold 
cards, but they are popping up in all sorts of places. Even Sharper Image, a 
purveyor of trendy gadgets and once a shining symbol of conspicuous 
consumption, is losing customers and money. 
</P>
<P>
What stands out about the emerging trend is that many luxury-goods merchants 
say they have never seen this happen before. 
</P>
<P>
The very rich tend to spend freely in good times and bad. But in the 1980s, an 
unprecedented flood of people came into affluence for the first time, and the 
luxury-goods business took off. In particular, the so-called low end of the 
luxury market exploded, catering to professionals who felt they could indulge 
in fancy restaurants, fine chocolates and European cars, if not million-dollar 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the new wealth that fueled the spending, however, dried up with the 
string of disasters that have hit Wall Street, the savings and loan industry 
and real estate. Also, the confidence of affluent consumers has been eroded by 
months of downbeat economic reports and, most recently, the Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, luxury merchandise has attracted "people who can really afford 
it," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report. "What is dropping 
off is the customer who went for luxury who couldn't really afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Market researchers and economists sense that the mood of upscale Americans has 
swung away the glitz of the '80s. "We're not dealing with that mad acquisitive 
state of mind any more," said Susan Hayward, senior vice president with the 
Yankelovich Clancy Shulman research firm. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of the times: A key measure of consumer debt, after hitting an 
all-time peak last year, has flattened. On average, consumers' debt from credit 
cards, auto loans and personal loans now equals 18.5% of their after-tax 
income, down from 18.8% last year. 
</P>
<P>
The aging of the American consumer also is playing a role in curbing spending. 
Many prosperous baby boomers have reached a point in their lives where they are 
married and having children. There are new demands on their time and money. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was single, I used to go out to the West Beach Cafe or 72 Market 
Street. Now I just go home," said Jeffrey Hirsch, 36, referring to a pair of 
trendy Venice restaurants. Hirsch, a marketing consultant, was married in 
February, and his wife is expecting their first child in December. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers' changing attitudes are crimping many businesses. On tony Rodeo 
Drive, high-end jewelers are said to be doing fine, but many other merchants 
are beginning to see their sales rise more gradually or even decline. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it, the fabulous acceleration that occurred through 
March has slowed down, but there's no recession on the street," said Donald G. 
Tronstein, a property owner with 11 retail tenants on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In Meccas of high living such as Southern California, the super wealthy and 
some other high-living consumers continue to spend. Even now, in the face of a 
nationwide slump in retail sales, customers are snapping up $3,000 handbags at 
the Hermes store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't think there is another way of spending money," said Francine Bardo, 
manager of the leather goods and apparel shop. "They need something and they're 
going to go to the usual store to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
But, even Hermes' sales have leveled off this year, Bardo said, after rising 
sharply last year. She said some other Rodeo merchants, particularly the less 
well-known retailers, have complained of sales declines of as much as 20% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, expensive restaurants have been pounded. According to the 
most recent figures from NPD Group, a market research firm, the number of meals 
served at fine dining establishments is off 4.2% from a year ago, while all 
other restaurant categories posted increases. 
</P>
<P>
Customers at pricey restaurants may be getting fussier. "I'll no longer spend 
$100, $150 or $200 for dinner unless the service is exquisite and it's a 
wonderful dining experience," said Sabra Lande, a fragrance firm executive in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Morris, a vice president with L'Ermitage, said there have been "horror 
stories" in the restaurant business. Aside from a slowdown in July, she said, 
L'Ermitage has been spared. Even so, it followed the lead of some competitors 
this month in adding the $15 entree of angel hair pasta, sauteed Italian 
vegetables and Parma ham. Before, its cheapest offering was $28 for such 
entrees as striped bass Viennoise. 
</P>
<P>
In the auto industry, the luxury market remains relatively strong mainly 
because of the popularity of new, less expensive status cars such as Toyota's 
Lexus and Nissan's Infinity. 
</P>
<P>
Over the first seven months of 1990, U.S. sales of cars costing more than 
$50,000 fell 1%. But sales of cars in the $35,000 to $50,000 range jumped 75%, 
and sales of models costing $25,000 to $35,000 climbed 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"The better value is attracting people," said Cynthia Certo, director of 
forecasting for the research firm Integrated Automotive Resources in Wayne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate prices are soft across the country, particularly in the badly 
slumping Northeast. But hardest to sell are houses in the pricey $300,000 to 
$800,000 range in California and East Coast communities, said Kenneth T. Rosen, 
chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who bought them were stretching to get into them, and people aren't 
willing to stretch that much now," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharper Image's stores and mail-order operation are finding it hard to attract 
eager buyers too. (Its latest catalogue still offers, though, many expensive 
nonessentials, such as a $1,995 reclining chair with massage rollers and a 
built-in stereo.) 
</P>
<P>
The result: This summer the company announced a layoff of about 110 workers and 
a quarterly loss of $1.6 million, its worst ever. 
</P>
<P>
Private country clubs are losing members, despite the booming popularity of 
golf. The percentage of households with annual income exceeding $60,000 that 
belong to a country club is 14.4%, down from 19% a year ago, according to a new 
national survey by Mendelsohn Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
The same survey found that the percentage of $60,000-plus households spending 
more than $1,000 on fine jewelry over the past year declined to 14.9% from 17% 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently sensing a shift in the attitudes of upscale consumers, advertisers 
are beginning to stress quality -- and even value -- rather than luxury. One 
recent example: A magazine ad proclaimed that even though "Jack Daniel's is 
priced above many whiskeys, a sip will prove its worth." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, an ad for the four-star San Diego County's Rancho Bernardo Inn 
trumpeted a special package deal: "One of the country's fine resorts offers one 
of the country's finest values." For its part, luxury auto maker BMW this 
spring introduced its low-end 318 series, with prices beginning at $19,900. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing designers, meanwhile, keep coming out with less expensive fashions, 
following the lead of such trendsetters as Donna Karan, who brought out her 
lower-priced DKNY line in the spring of 1989. "The freest-spending people of 
the Reagan era have now pulled back, and it's being reflected (in slumping 
sales totals) at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman 
Marcus," said Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that the 1990s will bring a re-emergence of the so-called 
middle market, an area abandoned by merchandisers who went after upscale 
customers in the 1980s. Eric Miller, publisher of the Affluent Markets Alert 
newsletter, speculates that the trend will help retailers such as Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co., whose stores have struggled in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the luxury market is hardly on the verge of collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Makers of gourmet foods, for example, have come out with 2,592 new products so 
far this year, up 49% from 1989. Miller said the affluent also will continue to 
pay dearly for time-saving conveniences and experiences they deeply enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Maid and gardening services, for example, are still popular and despite a 
current slump in travel, many will be hard pressed to sacrifice long-planned 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
What will suffer the most, Miller said, are frivolous purchases such as VCRs 
loaded with unnecessary options or accessories. "People are still going to want 
their electronic goodies," he said, "but they're going to want to buy ones that 
they use." 
</P>
<P>
Said Barnard, the retailing newsletter publisher: "People today no longer feel 
the need to show off, to show the rest of the world, 'look at how rich I am.' "

</P>

GREATEST SUCCESS IN YEARS. LAWMAKERS CITE INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE PUBLIC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation designed to benefit consumers on a host of topics -- from minivan 
safety to cloth diapers to Small Claims Court actions -- is meeting with its 
greatest success in the Legislature in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing weeks of the Legislature's 1989-90 session, lawmakers have 
approved dozens of bills to curb the abuse of personal credit information, 
require banks to beef up security at automatic teller machines and prevent the 
accidental poisoning of children by toxic household products. 
</P>
<P>
And in a significant departure from the past, the Legislature approved a bill 
that provides prison terms for employers and supervisors who knowingly expose 
consumers or workers to hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
While the Legislature is still stymied on such major issues as auto insurance 
and health insurance, advocates for consumer groups are pleased with the 
success rate for bills of a moderate scale that could benefit large segments of 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Pollyanna by nature, but I do think things are better," said Harry 
Snyder, a Consumers Union lobbyist who has been pushing legislators for years 
to pass such measures. "I think legislators are fed up with not accomplishing 
stuff. . . . They are tired of being treated like potted palms by the special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
The surge in consumer actions comes at a time when legislators have been 
battered by accusations that they serve special-interest campaign contributors 
at the expense of the public. The influence of special-interest lobbyists has 
been highlighted this month by the corruption trial of former Sen. Paul 
Carpenter taking place in federal court three blocks from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The push for consumer protections also comes during an election year in which 
92 of the 120 members of the Legislature are up for reelection and a new 
governor will be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
But legislators themselves discount the importance of election-year politics or 
their image problems. They say that consumer interest has intensified in the 
Legislature because of increased pressure from the public, heightened 
sensitivity among business leaders and a growing awareness among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly it's tied in to the environmental movement," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar). "The public is more conscious about what they buy from a toxic 
standpoint, from a recycling standpoint and also from a safety standpoint. That 
increased pressure from the public puts more pressure on the Legislature to 
pass consumer-oriented bills." 
</P>
<P>
Among the consumer measures sent to Gov. George Deukmejian in recent weeks was 
a measure by Katz that would require manufacturers of toxic household products 
-- such as antifreeze, insecticides or cleaners -- to use child-proof 
containers or add chemical agents to make them taste bitter. More than 130,000 
poisonings occur in California every year, most of them involving children 
under the age of 6, Katz said in pushing for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Also awaiting action by the governor is a bill by Assemblyman Johan Klehs 
(D-Castro Valley) that would require automobile dealers to notify buyers 
whether new minivans comply with federal safety standards. Under federal law, 
minivans do not have to meet the same crash-protection standards as other 
passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has also sent to Deukmejian a measure by Sen. Charles Calderon 
(D -- Whittier) that would require banks to provide adequate lighting and other 
security features to prevent assaults on customers using automatic teller 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to reduce accidents caused by automatic garage door openers, the 
Legislature passed a bill by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) that 
would establish minimum safety standards for the devices. At least 44 children 
have been killed nationwide -- including six in California -- by automatic 
garage door openers since 1982, Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
And Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) won passage of a bill that would 
require all office computer terminals to conform to national safety and 
ergonomic design standards. Injuries and stress complaints related to computer 
use constitute the fastest growing category of employee disability claims, 
Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
However, among the most significant consumer measures approved by the 
Legislature this year are bills that would impose penalties on corporations and 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
One bill by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) would make it a crime 
for a corporation or manager to knowingly conceal a dangerous product or 
business practice from consumers, employees or regulatory agencies. The measure 
provides up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000 for a manager 
convicted under the law. 
</P>
<P>
A bill by Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) would increase the limit on 
Small Claims Court awards from $2,000 to $5,000. At the same time, it would 
place a limit of two cases per year involving any claim over $2,500, thus 
restricting the ability of businesses to use the Small Claims system for 
recovering debts. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, consumer-oriented legislation has fared well this year because 
it addresses environmental issues such as air pollution and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
One such measure by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) would require child care 
facilities to give parents a choice of using cloth diapers instead of the 
disposable plastic diapers that cannot be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
A bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would give a sales tax break to 
buyers of low-polluting automobiles while boosting the tax on high-polluting 
vehicles. A consumer could save as much as $700 when buying a low-polluting, 
medium-priced model, according to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to protect the public from credit abuses, the Legislature has 
sent a number of measures to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
One bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) would prohibit merchants 
from requiring customers to write their telephone numbers or home addresses on 
credit card slips. This information is sometimes resold to telephone 
solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill by Areias would prohibit merchants from requiring customers to 
disclose their credit card numbers on the back of personal checks. In some 
cases, the information has been used illegally to charge purchases to credit 
card holders. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate leaders are becoming much more sensitive to their public image," 
said Areias in explaining why his measures succeeded. "They are aware of the 
increasing concern by the general public as it relates to consumer protection 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain which of all these consumer-related bills the governor will 
sign. Some bills, such as the measures that increase penalties for businessmen 
and require new standards for computer terminals, are strongly opposed by 
business groups who often have the Republican governor's ear. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this year, Deukmejian signed a variety of consumer bills including 
measures to curb telephone harassment, prohibit the mail-order sale of hearing 
aids by unlicensed distributors and require retailers who refuse to give 
refunds or exchanges to disclose their policy in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown predicted that consumer legislation will win even 
broader support in the future. "The level of interest is going to increase and 
you're going to see every member having some bill he or she calls a consumer 
bill," the San Francisco Democrat said.

UPDATE / NICARAGUA'S REBELS;

<P>
DISARMED AND DISILLUSIONED, THE CONTRAS BATTLE HARDSHIPS OF PEACE 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Ramon Hernandez lost his youth in combat and his farm in northern 
Nicaragua while fighting for the U.S.-backed Contras against Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
After ousting the Sandinistas in last February's elections, Nicaragua's 
conservative leaders achieved a peace settlement by offering Contras like 
Hernandez a new start. The 30-year-old peasant and thousands of other rebels 
exchanged their assault rifles last May and June for the promise of new farms 
and houses in what was to become a privileged resettlement community in the 
southeastern corner of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the government's part of the bargain remains unfulfilled. Much to the 
dismay of 5,000 ex-combatants who languish in hammocks and subsist on 
international donations, the government is unable to obtain land for them in 
the new communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought nine years so we could have democracy and work in peace, but it was 
all a waste of time," Hernandez said. "I gave up my rifle and my ammunition, 
and here I am without a house, without land, without decent food and full of 
uncertainty . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
His bitter comments one recent Sunday at a squalid campground in the town of El 
Almendro were echoed by other idled and ragged counter-revolutionary veterans, 
some of them drunk, who said they felt abandoned by President Violeta Barrios 
de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras' plight is a measure of Chamorro's inability to satisfy even her 
staunchest supporters in a politically divided, bankrupt postwar Nicaragua. Not 
the least of her woes is a greedy scramble for choice farmland as peace 
increases mobility in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations troops reported disarming 19,720 rebels before ending their 
Nicaraguan peace mission on June 29. Each disarmed Contra became eligible for 
rice-and-bean rations until December, a change of clothing, farm tools and a 
$50 start-up grant, paid for by the U.S. Congress and distributed by the 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by their leaders to stay intact, about half of the members of 
disarmed force lined up for resettlement land promised by the government -- 
42,000 acres near Rio Blanco in central Nicaragua and 28,000 acres near El 
Almendro in the southeast. Both expanses were considered remote enough to keep 
the ex-rebels free from harm by vengeful Sandinistas or competition from rival 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Security is turning out to be the lesser problem. Of all the disarmed rebels, 
six have been killed, under circumstances being investigated by the OAS. On the 
other hand, most former combatants who went to claim land in El Almendro and 
Rio Blanco found settlers already there. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us 28,000 acres with 28,000 problems," said one former rebel. 
</P>
<P>
It's not clear if the unexpected settlers are squatters sent by the 
Sandinistas, as rebel leaders contend, or former owners who had been driven out 
by the war and are returning. In any case, the government has no title records 
to straighten out the mess. So far, only 200 Contras have been legally 
resettled and thus made eligible for housing materials. Nearly 6,000 who had 
hoped to get land have given up and left El Almendro, scattering to live with 
relatives throughout Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras have formed a political party to lobby for their cause. But 
government ministers, accusing party leaders of seeking more land than can 
possibly be acquired, have ignored their demands and are trying to work 
directly with the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the government's natural allies, but they treat us like enemies," said 
party President Oscar Sovalbarro. On the phone recently, he warned Chamorro's 
minister for resettlement: "All my men want is a piece of land and they won't 
bother anyone. But, if there's no solution, they will take up arms and go back 
to the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel frustrations nearly exploded last week after 156 disarmed combatants 
seized an abandoned Sandinista cooperative near El Almendro. As Sandinista-led 
police officers and army troops headed out to evict them, the Contras rallied 
500 villagers to their side. A clash was averted with a negotiated withdrawal 
of the Contras -- and a new promise of land. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the Contras are disarmed, they are no longer a priority," said an 
international official who wonders how many of the idled rebels will eat after 
December. "I think it would take an armed confrontation for the government to 
pay enough high-level attention to solve this problem."

Bags packed, 41 speeches ready, his pronunciation of Swahili, Kirundi and 
Kinyarwanda polished with the help of tutors, Pope John Paul II ends a quiet 
and sedentary summer here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On the road again. 
</P>
<P>
Like a salesman canvassing a rich new territory, the 70-year-old pontiff is 
returning for the second time this year to Africa, where the Roman Catholic 
Church is growing even faster than the continent's mushrooming population. 
</P>
<P>
The arduous 10-day journey will take him to the dirt-poor, AIDS-assaulted East 
African nations of Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda and then to the troubled Ivory 
Coast in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There, John Paul will accept the gift of a St. Peter's-sized basilica from a 
patriarch-president who rebuts widespread corruption charges by insisting that 
he built the $200-million church with his own money on family land. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's aides say the papal themes during this trip will mirror those voiced 
in a January visit to five equally poor West African nations. By his very 
presence, the Pope will remind wealthier nations that a desperately poor 
continent of 610 million people needs more help to confront its social and 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The developed nations, John Paul warned in January, "cannot abandon their 
common and current responsibilities for the south, for the problems of the 
Third World." 
</P>
<P>
In East Africa, where fledgling health systems are strained to the breaking 
point by AIDS, the Pope will appeal anew for compassion for sufferers of the 
disease and greater education to check its spread, Vatican aides said. 
</P>
<P>
This last foreign trip of 1990, the 49th of his reign, will mark John Paul's 
seventh visit to a teeming continent where Catholicism has grown by 50% in the 
last decade, to more than 80 million African Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the continent's growing religious fervor and nearly universal deprivation, 
most Africans live under dictatorships. Tanzania has been a one-party state for 
all of its 26 years of independence. John Paul may use it as a forum to call 
for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the mostly Catholic neighboring countries of Burundi and Rwanda 
are torn by violent tribal rivalries, which may invite a papal lecture on 
fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
In a return visit to the Ivory Coast, John Paul will stop only at Yamoussoukro, 
the new capital and hometown of 85-year-old President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. 
There, he will meet with clerics planning a 1993 synod of Africa's 487 bishops. 
And he will consecrate the new Our Lady of Peace basilica. 
</P>
<P>
The air-conditioned church, framed by 128 Doric columns enclosing a piazza 
larger than St. Peter's, is crowned by a 525-foot dome, the tallest in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Local critics, including 127 university professors arrested earlier this year 
for demonstrating against government corruption, call the church 
Houphouet-Boigny's white elephant monument to himself in a nation of 10 million 
where most people exist at subsistence level. 
</P>
<P>
Houphouet-Boigny offered it to an embarrassed Vatican last year. After he 
promised to build an adjoining hospital and social services center, John Paul 
accepted the gift and responsibility for maintaining it. To have rejected it, 
Vatican officials say, might have alienated vigorous Catholic communities 
across Africa.

BUSH'S MOVE TO SHARE BUILDUP COSTS MIRRORS U.S. SHIFT IN MILITARY ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
DEPLOYMENT: NATION NO LONGER SEES ITSELF AS THE 'ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY.' 
ANALYSTS POINT TO A POSSIBLE RESURGENCE OF ISOLATIONISM.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's plea to U.S. allies to share in the financial burden of the 
Middle East crisis reflects a major change since the Vietnam War in America's 
view of its military role in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the 20th Century, the United States has seen itself as the 
"arsenal of democracy" and a principal financier in times of war. But over the 
past decade, Americans have become increasingly less willing to assume the 
burden for defending the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, such as Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), a member of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, see this shift as a resurgence of isolationism in the 
United States that began after the nation's long and costly military adventure 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people in the United States who believe that we shouldn't 
be the world's policeman," Shelby said. 
</P>
<P>
But others think this new attitude is rooted primarily in global economics. 
Americans no longer feel it is fair for the deficit-ridden United States to 
shoulder most of the burden for the defense of nations such as Japan and West 
Germany, which are currently cash-rich. 
</P>
<P>
"We once were the economic and military leaders of the world," said Ronald J. 
Bartek, a House Armed Services Committee expert on allied burden-sharing. "We 
still have the world's best military, but we no longer have the world's leading 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, this change in American attitudes was something that Bush 
could not ignore as he geared up for what may be a long commitment that so far 
has cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $46 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Bush earlier this week, members of Congress told the 
President bluntly that the U.S. military deployment in the Middle East would 
quickly lose popular support across the nation unless Japan, West Germany and 
other allies, as well as the the Arab nations, carry more of the financial 
burden. The issue is expected to be debated at length when Congress reconvenes 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), the Senate's most outspoken critic of the role that 
U.S. allies play in their own defense, said Americans are demanding to know why 
the United States has assumed the major burden in opposing Iraqi aggression 
when the Japanese are more dependent on Middle East oil and the oil-rich Arab 
nations have more at stake in this confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go, people are saying, 'These other countries have to help us,' " 
Dixon said. "American taxpayers think: 'Uncle Sam always pays, and in the end 
that is me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Modern history is filled with examples of America's role as financier of wars. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the United States entered World War I, it loaned huge sums of money 
to the Allies at standard interest rates. And ultimately, while more than 
100,000 Americans died in that war, perhaps the most significant American 
contribution was in financing and producing weapons for the Allied victory. 
</P>
<P>
In World War II, U.S. involvement began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 
"lend-lease" program, under which he loaned equipment to the democratic enemies 
of Hitler's Nazi Germany. After Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States became 
the chief Allied military force and later poured billions of dollars of aid 
into Europe under the Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
And during the Korean War, which -- like the Iraqi blockade -- was regarded as 
a United Nations action, the United States received only limited allied 
support. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the United States' agonizing defeat in Vietnam that Americans 
began to complain that their country could not always be "the world's 
policeman." And since the end of that war, there has been a residual reluctance 
to get involved in Third World conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, a swelling chorus of members of Congress has been 
demanding an increased financial commitment from NATO allies for the defense of 
Europe and a greater Japanese role in the security of the Pacific region. This 
led to some U.S. troop reductions in Europe and the Pacific as well as cuts in 
military construction outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there now appears to be growing congressional sentiment for a cut 
in U.S. troops in Korea, another nation whose economy has soared in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, it is clear that the economic realities of the 1980s have overcome 
whatever lingering sentiment there was from the post-World War II era that 
Germany and Japan should never again be allowed to pose a military threat to 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that it's an accident that our burden-sharing controversy 
reached its peak in the 1980s as our deficit mounted and as Americans felt 
themselves coming under greater economic pressure from our allies in the global 
markets," said Ted Carpenter, director of foreign policy studies at the CATO 
Institute, a libertarian think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), who headed a special House panel that explored 
the issue of military burden-sharing two years ago, said Americans are furious 
that Japan and West Germany are heavily dependent on the United States for 
their defense while they appear to be beating the U.S. in the world 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
She said the NATO imbalance is particularly frustrating for Americans now that 
the Soviet threat to Europe appears to have diminished and Germany is on the 
verge of reunification. It is estimated that 60% of the U.S. defense budget is 
aimed at defending Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As Schroeder puts it, "Everybody on Main Street is saying, 'You mean we've got 
300,000 Americans over there to protect West Germany against East Germany, and 
all of the East Germans are shopping at the malls in West Germany? You mean 
we're keeping the Pacific safe so that the Japanese can ship us Subarus?' "

DIPLOMACY: JORDAN'S WASHINGTON AMBASSADOR ACCUSES BUSH OF ACTING AGAINST THE 
BEST INTERESTS OF THE GULF REGION.

Jordan's ambassador to the United States declared Thursday that the Bush 
Administration is adding "fuel to an already troubled region" and cannot hope 
to arbitrate the Persian Gulf conflict as long as it supports Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the sharpest public rebuff yet from a Jordanian official, Ambassador Hussein 
A. Hammami declared that Washington's deployment of military units in the Arab 
world is both unwarranted and unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not delude yourself that most Arabs welcome the presence of American troops 
in the region," he said in his speech at the Washington Press Club. "Arabs are 
extremely wary of the United States and Western intentions in the region." 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that the United States has not been honest about its motives. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than to defend the legitimate government of Kuwait, he said, the 
Administration was intent on "assuring the continued flow of oil." 
</P>
<P>
"That purpose is contrary to the best interests of the region," Hammami said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Administration has been working to gently coax Jordan's 
support for the tough U.S. posture in the crisis, a crucial step needed to 
tighten the economic embargo on neighboring Iraq and to defuse Arab tensions 
about Western intervention. Hammami's address clearly reflected that success is 
not imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, it is counterproductive for foreign forces to come and 
try to resolve the problem" posed by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, he said. ". . . 
It will not produce stability; it will be rather the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Hammami insisted that Jordan is not aligning itself with Iraq in Baghdad's 
determination to keep Kuwait as Iraqi territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is neither siding with Iraq, nor is it against Kuwait," he said. "We 
simply seek to avert a catastrophe which would engulf the Middle East with 
repercussions affecting the whole world for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Hammami said the United States and other Western nations are also insensitive 
to the economic damage suffered by Jordan from the U.N-imposed embargo. The 
loss of trade revenue with Iraq, the influx of 20,000 refugees from Kuwait per 
day and the need to import higher-priced oil from other sources have strained 
Jordan's economy to the limit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless "Jordan has repeatedly stated that it will comply with these 
sanctions," Hammami said. Jordan is asking the United Nations to provide $2 
billion annually to compensate for the loss, and the United States has also 
pledged to help organize relief. 
</P>
<P>
Hammami called on the United States to reassess its strong support for Israel 
if it wants to build credibility with the Arab nations and people. 
</P>
<P>
No nation can be "the defender of the rights of the Kuwaitis to 
self-determination when it rejects that right for the Palestinians," he said.

IMMIGRANTS CITED AS KEY TO POPULATION GROWTH OF 1980S; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: DEMOGRAPHERS ALSO SAY EARLY FIGURES SHOW RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING 
RESIDENTS. BUREAU OFFICIALS CAUTION AGAINST RELYING ON PRELIMINARY NUMBERS.

<P>
Waves of immigrants, seeking the American Dream, contributed heavily to the 
nation's estimated population growth of 23 million people during the decade, 
according to demographers and social scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, growth in the nation's rural areas reversed itself once again as 
millions of Americans migrated to urban centers, according to preliminary 
Census Bureau figures that estimate the nation's total population at 245.8 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates, based on the census mail returns and follow-up interviews this 
spring, are subject to change, bureau officials said. They refused to discuss 
the significance of the figures and cautioned against relying on them. 
</P>
<P>
However, observers are studying the early returns as a way to test their 
independent estimates of national population growth and demographic trends. 
And, they say, they're finding that the preliminary findings match their 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting counts that are consistent with what we've known," said Jeffrey 
Passel, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington. "Maybe their 
counts are a little bit lower than what we were expecting, but they're in line 
with the kinds of projections we made. People are showing up in the places we 
expected them to be." 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious examples of matching trends, he says, can be found in a 
comparison of the early findings of the nation's two most populous states: 
Nearly all demographers predicted that California would be a winner and New 
York a relative loser in the census count. 
</P>
<P>
California showed about 29.3 million residents, a 23.7% increase over the 1980 
count. New York, where a failing economy has nudged away jobs and workers, 
showed a paltry 0.4% population gain to 17.6 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners in the preliminary tally include Nevada (49.1% increase), Arizona 
(+33.1%), Florida (+31.1%) and Texas (+11.8%) in the Sun Belt. Losers, 
including Iowa (-5.1%), Illinois (-0.9%), Pennsylvania (-0.8%) and Michigan 
(-0.9%), are clustered in the Rust Belt. 
</P>
<P>
John Connolly, an assistant to Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, said 
these early figures are "working numbers," adding: "We expect these numbers to 
rise throughout the country. We don't know how much of a rise because we're not 
finished counting yet." 
</P>
<P>
But demographers say the figures are helpful. In particular, they point to the 
numbers to prove their belief that legal and illegal immigration is boosting 
the nation's population. In some states, for example, the infusion of 
immigrants during the 1980s prevented a decline in total population, said 
Passel, an immigration expert. 
</P>
<P>
"New York grew by about 70,000 people, if the census figures are to be 
believed," he says. "But New York got close to 1 million immigrants over the 
decade. Clearly, without the immigrants, New York would be losing population at 
a pretty rapid clip." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that California, Texas and Florida are magnets for immigrants, as well 
as for native-born residents seeking jobs and warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind all these changes is economics, said William P. 
O'Hare, director of policy studies with the Population Reference Bureau, a 
Washington-based firm specializing in demographic trends. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of the nation's immigrants are going to the Sun Belt states," he 
said. "They're following the jobs. I don't see anything about that trend that's 
going to change in the next couple of decades." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Johnson, a demographer at Loyola University in Chicago, said his analysis 
of the preliminary figures shows that rural areas are losing residents once 
again, reversing a short-lived trend during the 1970s of rural community gains 
and urban population losses. 
</P>
<P>
Passel said the shift in population from one region to another creates severe 
pressures as communities grapple with housing and employing the new residents. 
"My sense is, however, that population growth is probably less of a problem for 
the place getting the people than it is for the places losing them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse if you lose your jobs and your tax base. Then the communities are 
left with infrastructure problems. How do you support the infrastructure with 
few (work-age) people?" 
</P>
<P>
The political implications of that fact are not lost on local and state 
officials, who also stand to lose or gain congressional representation based on 
the census figures, because the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are 
apportioned by state population. Also at stake are federal dollars from 
programs funded on a population basis. 
</P>
<P>
California is expected to gain seven additional congressional seats, bringing 
the state to 52 representatives. New York, by contrast, is expected to lose 
three seats. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials, such as those in Los Angeles and New York, are complaining 
about an undercount of their residents and are preparing to mount challenges to 
change the numbers before final figures are reported to President Bush on Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, while pleased with the way Los Angeles fared in the 
preliminary report, said he couldn't wholly embrace the census tally, 
"especially in light of the disastrous undercount reported across the country." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins was more blunt, calling the preliminary 
returns "unadulterated nonsense." He was joined by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who 
said the state was undercounted and his Administration will "do anything we can 
to challenge it."

POLITICAL FIGURE FATALLY SHOT IN N.Y. OFFICE 
</P>

<P>
A former Democratic state senator and congressional candidate who was running 
for a post on the Democratic State Committee in next month's primary election 
was fatally shot Thursday at his campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Vander Beatty, a one-time political powerhouse in Brooklyn's predominantly 
black Bedford-Stuyvesant section who fell from political grace in an election 
fraud scandal, was shot once in the neck and once in the arm about an hour 
after midnight, police said. He died 20 minutes after being taken to Brooklyn 
Jewish Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, 49, was in his campaign office in the Prospect Heights section of 
Brooklyn when an unidentified male shot him and fled in a blue Oldsmobile, 
authorities said. No motive for the crime was immediately apparent, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated death across town, an assistant district attorney was killed in 
a hail of gunfire from a passing car as he shopped inside a food store near the 
Bronx County Courthouse, where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Healy, 30, was shot once in the head by gunmen who fired more than a 
half-dozen bullets into the store at around 11 a.m., police said. Michael 
Philbin, chief of Bronx detectives, said that Healy was not the target of the 
drive-by shooting but "happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty served in the New York Legislature as an assemblyman and senator from 
1970 to 1982, when he stepped down to make an ill-fated run for the 
congressional seat then being vacated by longtime lawmaker Rep. Shirley 
Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was defeated in the Democratic primary by Major Owens but attempted to 
force a new election by forging signatures on more than 2,800 voter 
registration cards. Owens went on to win the seat in the general election and 
still holds it. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was later convicted of forgery and election fraud in connection with the 
voter registration scheme and served 19 months in jail. He was released in 
September of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a substantial power base when he was in office," said a Democratic 
political activist in Brooklyn who asked to remain unidentified. "One would 
probably think of him as an old-fashioned ward heeler. I would categorize him 
as a political moderate." 
</P>
<P>
After years of relative political inactivity, Beatty was attempting a comeback 
this year by contending for Democratic state committeeman from the 57th 
Assembly District, a racially and ethnically mixed area of Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
The slayings of Beatty and Healy, the Bronx prosecutor, were the latest in a 
mounting wave of killings that has swept over New York this year. Homicides 
jumped 25% in the first half of 1990 to a record high of 1,051. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has campaigned recently for gun control, said at a 
news conference to announce Beatty's murder: "Somehow, we're going to have to 
get the citizenry of this country outraged at the proliferation of guns." 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm, the former congresswoman, was stunned by news of Beatty's death. "Oh, 
God," she said. "I just got the shock of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Healy was hit as he bent over to take a box of doughnuts from a shelf of the 
Mark Food Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes before the shooting, police responded to a call to check out a 
dispute by four men who apparently were brandishing guns at a site down the 
street from the store. But when four patrol cars arrived they found nothing and 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it was unclear whether there was any connection between the 
reported dispute and the subsequent drive-by shooting in which Healy was slain.

EARTHQUAKE SWARM RUMBLES THROUGH SALTON SEA AREA

<P>
A swarm of small earthquakes rattled the desert near the Salton Sea on Thursday 
evening, but no damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The largest quake, at 8:37 p.m., measured 4.4 in magnitude, according to 
preliminary estimates by seismologists at Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
It was followed by a 3.2 temblor that rumbled across parts of Imperial and 
eastern San Diego counties at 9:24 p.m., said Caltech spokeswoman Heidi 
Aspaturian. 
</P>
<P>
The first quake, at 6:05 p.m., had an estimated 3.7 magnitude. An aftershock 
measuring 3.0 hit 18 minutes later. "Seismologists here are referring to it as 
a swarm," Aspaturian said. "They haven't yet identified a fault." 
</P>
<P>
All were centered five miles west of Salton City, about 130 miles southeast of 
downtown Los Angeles. The area, just east of the San Diego County line, has 
experienced similar seismic activity before, but the cause of the quakes is not 
yet known, said Caltech seismologist Riley Geary.

After a week of roller-coaster negotiations, the two Germanys early today 
initialed a treaty setting conditions for their Oct. 3 political unification. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which constitutes the final important piece of legislation between 
the two Germanys on their internal aspects of unity, is scheduled to be signed 
later today in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
It must be ratified by both German parliaments before unification occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the treaty, which deals with a broad spectrum of subjects ranging 
from education and finance to local government administration, has been held up 
by prolonged, sometimes heated, attempts by West Germany's major political 
parties to find a compromise on an abortion law for a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
While negotiators had worked through a series of complex issues involved in 
merging East Germany's highly centralized, former Communist political system 
with its democratic West German counterpart, they ran aground in their attempts 
to reconcile sharply conflicting abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat-led coalition had hoped 
to complete talks last week. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's former Communist government enacted a de facto 
abortion-on-demand law in the early 1970s, while an emotional national debate 
in West Germany a few years later left the country with strict 
abortion-by-exception legislation that still remains on the books. 
</P>
<P>
All major parties in both Germanys agreed at an early stage in the talks that 
both laws should remain in force during an interim period until new, all-German 
legislation can be drafted by a united German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
However, they were deeply divided over how the two laws should be applied. 
</P>
<P>
In a significant concession, Kohl's Christian Democrats seemed to pave the way 
for agreement Wednesday by dropping their insistence that a woman's residence 
be the determining factor -- a principle criticized by feminist groups as 
highly discriminatory because it meant that West German women who obtained an 
abortion in what is now East Germany would be subject to criminal prosecution, 
while East German women would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats, whose support is required for the necessary 
two-thirds majority for parliamentary ratification and who had insisted that 
this provision be scrapped, seemed ready to back the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
However, within hours, a new dispute erupted between the West German parties 
over the length of the period during which the two laws should be permitted to 
exist parallel to each other. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats wanted to ensure that tougher West German legislation 
applied to all of a united Germany if there were no consensus for a new law 
within two years. But this was rejected by the Social Democrats, who wanted a 
five-year interim period, with no commitment to extend existing West German 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's party, along with its Bavarian sister organization, the Christian 
Socialists, draw much of their support from the Roman Catholic southern and 
southwestern parts of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At a midnight press conference, the party leaders agreed on the two-year limit 
but dropped any reference to the subsequent preeminence of the tougher West 
German law. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, together with a majority of West German members of 
Parliament, in recent years have become disillusioned with the ineffectiveness 
of criminal prosecution in halting abortion and instead now talk of including 
the issue in a larger legislative package that would deal with support for 
pregnant women and mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can speak of a real breakthrough," said Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine, a 
candidate for chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
As the abortion dispute tied the West German side in knots in Bonn, the East 
German Parliament in East Berlin briefly placed today's signing in doubt when 
it overwhelmingly rejected plans Thursday to ship about 6 million files 
maintained by the Communist Ministry for State Security -- the secret police, 
known as the Stasi -- to the West German National Archive in Koblenz. 
</P>
<P>
With only two opposing votes, the Volkskammer overturned the selection of 
Koblenz, which had been approved by a team of East and West German negotiators, 
and demanded that the files be distributed to regional East German centers and 
be made accessible to the individuals concerned. 
</P>
<P>
A hastily arranged compromise will place the files in the hands of a trustee 
and leave the final decision on their location to an all-German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The first all-German election since the early 1930s is scheduled for Dec. 2.

CANADA ARMY TOLD TO CLEAR MOHAWK BARRICADES AT OKA

Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa revived his order Thursday night to have the 
Canadian army clear the Mohawk barricades at the town of Oka after last-ditch 
talks aimed at a peaceful settlement broke off. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement shattered beliefs that the seven-week conflict was on the 
verge of being resolved after other Mohawks at a reservation south of Montreal 
agreed Wednesday to help soldiers dismantle a blockade of a commuter bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa said the negotiators from the Iroquois Confederation, which includes 
the Mohawk tribe, pulled out of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for the government of Quebec to pursue any discussions without 
these negotiators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion, Mohawk negotiators who arrived for scheduled talks 
were informed of the provincial government's decision by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not aware," said Chief Billy Two-Rivers of the Kahnawake reservation. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when the army would move on the barricades at Oka, the resort 
20 miles west of Montreal where the conflict began in July when a Quebec 
policeman was killed during a shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement struck between the Mohawks at the Kahnawake reservation and an 
army commander Wednesday afternoon took the Mohawks at Oka by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff began July 11, when policemen stormed a blockade erected by 
Mohawks to stop the town from extending a golf course onto land they regard as 
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
In sympathy with their tribal brethren, the Kahnawake Mohawks set up a 
fortified blockade on the Mercier Bridge linking the island of Montreal to its 
southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the collapse of the negotiations regarding the Oka 
barricades would affect the agreement to clear the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A solution to the impasse at Oka appeared imminent earlier Thursday. Quebec 
Indian Affairs Minister John Ciaccia, who met with Indians for 20 hours, 
reported some progress.

POLICE SAY MAN SHOT WIFE, SELF

A Camarillo man fatally shot his wife in their bedroom Thursday evening, 
confessed his crime to his 15-year-old stepson and then shot himself with a 
rifle while the boy pleaded on the phone to police for help, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the man and his wife, whose names were not released, died at Pleasant 
Valley Hospitalin Camarillo. The woman, in her late 30s, suffered multiple 
gunshot wounds and died shortly after her arrival at the hospital. Her husband, 
age 38, suffered one shot to the head. He died at 7:19 p.m., police and 
hospital authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Lt. Gary Markley said the 15-year-old boy was 
unharmed. The boy's 8-year-old half-sister, the child of both the man and the 
woman, was at a baby-sitter's at the time of the shootings, Markley said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Joe Harwell said the killings stemmed from domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Harwell said the boy was doing chores outside the family's home about 5:25 p.m. 
when he heard a scuffle. The boy knocked on the door of a bedroom at the home, 
on Jeffrey Drive in an upscale unincorporated pocket of hillside Camarillo 
houses overlooking the city, but could not get in. His stepfather told him to 
call 911, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
As the boy talked on the phone with a police dispatcher, his stepfather came 
out through a sliding-glass door. The boy's view was partly obscured, but he 
watched as his stepfather slumped to the ground, Markley said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they believed the man had been involved in motion pictures and 
police said he may have also run a video wedding business. The woman worked as 
a secretary. They had been married for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Kathy Barnett, who lives two doors away, said that the neighborhood is 
generally a quiet one and that the couple usually kept to themselves. The homes 
are isolated on large lots, and a six-foot chain-link fence bordered with 
oleanders isolated the victims' home. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father arrived at the home late Thursday to pick him up, and the girl 
was taken into protective custody by the county's child protective services 
division.

ANXIOUS WAIT ENDING FOR KIN OF BANKER WHO ESCAPED

Abdalla Touny's timing couldn't have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old American bank officer flew halfway around the globe to arrive 
in Kuwait City on Aug. 2, just one hour before Iraqi troops invaded the tiny 
desert emirate, trapping him in the midst of an international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With the borders closed and troops moving through the countryside, Touny hid in 
the basement of the family home near Kuwait city and from there, he spoke only 
once with his wife, Abla, who was in the United States, wrapping up the family 
vacation just as he became trapped. 
</P>
<P>
She did not hear from him again for three weeks. "Oh God, you have no idea what 
it was like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, as TWA Flight 861, landed at Los Angeles International 
Airport, Abla Touny waited nervously for her husband, as did their children, 
who carried yellow and red flowers and a yellow cardboard sign with hearts on 
it, and the legend: "Welcome home dad." 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks "we kept calling the State Department and they kept telling us 
everything was fine. We asked them to send a message (to Touny) but there was 
no answer." Abdalla Touny is one of the small number of foreigners who have 
managed to escape Kuwait across the desert. About 12,000 Westerners are 
believed to be still held in Iraq and Kuwait, including about 2,900 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Abla Touny said her husband left their home and headed across the desert by 
car. His first try was for the Saudi Arabian border, but he was turned back 
there by Iraqi soldiers, his wife said. When he reached Jordan, he was broke 
and exhausted, and had ditched his American passport, knowing the Iraqis were 
looking for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-born Tounys, naturalized U.S. citizens, had lived in Kuwait for 
two years. Abdalla worked as an officer for the Bank of Kuwait; his wife was a 
clinical chemist at the University of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The couple and their two children, Dinah, 13, and Sharif, 18, came here on June 
3 for a summer vacation. They expected go back to Kuwait and spend at least 
another year there before returning to their permanent home in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Abdalla decided to return to Kuwait first. His wife and daughter were to follow 
two weeks later. Sharif would stay on as a student at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the invasion, Touny was still unaware that Iraqi forces had 
occupied the country until his wife called him. Abdalla then called the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait, where officials suggested he "just stay put" at his villa, 
his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
He kept up phone contact with the embassy, but his wife did not hear from him 
again until six days ago, and was startled to hear he had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Abdalla called again from Cairo; he said he was on his way 
home.

OAKLAND EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR RELOCATION DECISION BY RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: NEGOTIATIONS TO KEEP THE TEAM IN L.A. APPARENTLY ARE MAKING LITTLE 
PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland has extended by 30 days its deadline for Raider acceptance or rejection 
of the city's offer to return the football team to the Bay Area, authorities 
there announced Thursday. The original 45-day period had been scheduled to 
expire today. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure by both Oakland and Alameda County officials discredits reports 
that the Raiders might seek an immediate termination of their contract to play 
in the Los Angeles Coliseum through 1991 so they could return to Oakland this 
season. The regular National Football League season will begin before 
expiration of the new deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland announcement said the 30-day extension was necessary because 
geological tests on the costs and time required to lower the stadium floor and 
expand the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum have not been completed, and 
therefore the city and county could not guarantee the terms of their 
$127-million offer to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The new delay in the time allowed for a decision by team owner Al Davis over 
where his team will play comes at a time when negotiations to keep the team in 
Los Angeles have apparently made little recent progress. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, describing a new offer to Davis by the Los Angeles Coliseum's 
private managers, Spectacor Management Group, participants in the discussions 
said they were awaiting a response within that same week. 
</P>
<P>
But Spectacor chief Ed Snider said Davis has not responded to the offer yet. 
</P>
<P>
While Snider said that "his people are working very hard with our people in 
reviewing documents and so forth," a Los Angeles Coliseum commissioner who has 
been active in efforts to keep the team expressed impatience with Davis this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has the final best offer within 1% of what Oakland or Los Angeles 
is going to give him," Commissioner Richard Riordan said. "I'd bet my life he 
knows that. So, I'd say, 'Al, in the name of God, make up your mind, for the 
good of L.A. and for the good of Oakland.' " 
</P>
<P>
As usual, there was no public comment from Davis or his aides. Raiders 
officials have occasionally been talking to both Oakland and Los Angeles 
newsmen, but always on condition that nothing be attributed directly or 
indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
The continued uncertainty over the Raiders' future may be having an adverse 
effect on the team's ability to draw fans in Los Angeles. Attendance at the 
first exhibition game two weeks ago was announced at 28,000 in the 92,000-seat 
Coliseum, although some observers believed it was less than that. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he believes that a Davis commitment to stay in Los Angeles in 
exchange for Coliseum renovation and private advance payments to the team 
"would have a positive effect on his fan support. . . . It is getting late, 
however, for him to sell many more season tickets."

4 CANYONS LABELED OK FOR USE AS TRASH SITES; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILLS: A COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT ENDORSES AREAS IN THE SAN 
FERNANDO AND SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Four mountain canyons ringing the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys are 
environmentally suitable for use as landfills, according to a county report to 
be released today that suggests that at least three of them eventually will 
have to become dumps to solve Los Angeles County's waste disposal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report appears to set the stage for increasingly 
heated conflicts over the future of the rustic land, pitting dump proponents 
against parkland supporters. 
</P>
<P>
County sanitation officials have long touted the sites as potential dumps and 
have been trying to acquire property in the canyons -- Towsley, Elsmere, Blind 
and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
But the report is their first declaration that the sites are geologically 
suitable for landfills, and that they could be developed without serious risk 
to ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Most other environmental problems -- such as noise, odor, dust and traffic -- 
could be avoided or reduced by careful operation of landfills, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
It concedes that some problems, such as loss of wildlife habitat, are 
unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
The draft study, which has been in the works for nearly a year and a half, was 
sponsored by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which disposes of 
trash for 78 cities, and by the county Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials face neighborhood opposition and serious political 
obstacles to turning the canyons into dumps. Elsmere Canyon is partially within 
the Angeles National Forest and the other three are part of county-designated 
Significant Ecological Areas -- lands containing rare plants or valuable 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mountain parks and trails already exist or are planned in Towsley, 
Blind and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mission-Rustic-Sullivan site provisionally has been put off 
limits to landfill development. A complex agreement reached earlier this year 
between Los Angeles city and county officials prohibits a dump at the site if a 
landfill is opened in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
BKK Corp., a private waste disposal firm, is seeking approval for the Elsmere 
dump, with the understanding that the county and city will buy out its interest 
and operate the landfill once permits are obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the sites are within the Santa Clarita Valley: Elsmere, just north of 
Sylmar and east of the city of Santa Clarita; and Towsley, just west of the 
Golden State Freeway and south of the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
Blind Canyon is in the Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, two miles north 
of the Simi Valley Freeway. Mission, Sullivan and Rustic -- three canyons 
considered as a single dump site -- are above Brentwood, immediately south of 
Mulholland Drive and west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy environmental report does not rank the sites in order of 
suitability. However, it cites a need over 50 years for about 550 million more 
tons of publicly owned landfill capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nellor, chief of planning and engineering for the solid waste management 
department of the Sanitation Districts, acknowledged Thursday that developing 
at least three of the four canyons would meet that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said more specific plans for new landfills will be contained in the 
final version of the report, to be issued after public hearings and a 60-day 
comment period. 
</P>
<P>
The report says new landfills are only a part of an "integrated" solid waste 
strategy needed to avert an "impending disposal crisis in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy also requires that existing landfills be expanded and waste 
reduction and recycling programs be aggressively pursued. In the short run, 
these two elements will be more crucial, the report says, because developing a 
new landfill takes five to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows "we have to use the combination of solutions to avoid a 
serious and health-endangering trash crisis in the county," said Steve Maguin, 
chief of solid waste management for the Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the rest of the world, we're simply throwing away far more trash than the 
land can absorb," he said. "No solution will work unless all of us practice 
waste diversion." 
</P>
<P>
Under a state law that took effect in January, cities and counties must cut 
landfill disposal at least 25% by 1995, and 50% by the year 2000, by some 
combination of recycling and eliminating waste. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report assumes these deadlines will be met, although it says it is 
uncertain how this can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the deadlines are met, the report says, new landfills and landfill 
expansions will be required to meet the needs of a county population growing 
about 1% per year. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 10 big landfills and 2 waste-to-energy plants take the county's 
trash output of more than 48,000 tons per day. Seven of those landfills have 
room to expand -- including Sunshine and Lopez canyons in the San Fernando 
Valley, Chiquita Canyon in the Santa Clarita Valley and Scholl Canyon in 
Glendale -- but most face expiration of their permits within the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, the public has 60 days to comment on the draft of an 
environmental impact report that outlines the possible measures to handle the 
growing amount of solid waste generated in Los Angeles County each day. Public 
hearings will be held in October throughout the county. After the hearings, 
sanitation officials will make recommendations on, among other things, 
landfills and recycling when the final impact report is submitted to the board 
of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts and the Board of Supervisors. 
Copies of the report are available at selected county libraries. Copies of the 
40-page summary are available at the Sanitation Districts, 1955 Workman Mill 
Road, Whittier 90607-4998.

Political Considerations 
</P>
<P>
Towsley Canyon: The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has purchased 145 acres 
of parkland in the canyon and hopes to obtain more. Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
and Santa Clarita oppose a dump in Towsley. 
</P>
<P>
Blind Canyon: Entertainer Bob Hope has tentatively agreed to sell the canyon to 
the conservancy for a park. The canyon straddles Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties and would require approval from both counties to become a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Elsmere Canyon: Located partly in Angeles National Forest, the canyon is just 
outside Santa Clarita, which opposes the dump. But an Elsmere landfill has the 
backing of the Los Angeles City Council and county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>

LAWYER TOLD TO AMEND SUIT OVER CONSERVATION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura Superior Court judge Thursday gave an attorney 30 days to amend for a 
second time a lawsuit challenging Ventura's stringent water conservation 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"In the suit, we allege that the ordinance is arbitrary and capricious, and the 
judge asked us to be more specific," said Ventura attorney Lindsay F. Nielson, 
who filed the suit in May. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Melinda K. Johnson's decision extends the first legal challenge to a 
water-conservation ordinance in California since a statewide drought began four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the ordinance -- which sets penalties for families and 
businesses that use too much water -- violates residents' constitutional rights 
to equal protection because a family of four is allowed the same amount as a 
person living alone. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson threw out a second contention in the lawsuit -- that the city should 
have done an environmental impact report before adopting the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the 35-day statute of limitations for requesting the 
environmental report had expired when Nielson filed the first amended version 
of his complaint in June. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also ruled Thursday that the suit was flawed because Nielson did not 
specify in which capacity he had signed the complaint -- as a plaintiff or as 
an attorney representing a plaintiff. But she gave Nielson 30 days to clear up 
this technicality. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still alive," Nielson said of the judge's ruling. "The city has a lot of 
defenses going for it. If we can get to the merits of this case, that's what 
I'm interested in, but there are a lot of minefields ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Nielson said he would review recent case law before deciding whether to go 
forward with the suit or possibly appeal the judge's decision on the 
environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael R. Dougherty, who represented the city, said he hoped that 
Johnson's ruling would discourage Nielson. "He seems to be losing enthusiasm, 
but only time will tell," Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit had come close to being thrown out of court in June, when Johnson 
ruled that it was seriously flawed. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious problem at the time was that Nielson had taken issue with the 
wrong ordinance: In three separate documents, it mentioned a 1989 water waste 
ordinance instead of the 1990 mandatory water-rationing ordinance that the suit 
intended to target. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also ruled in June that Nielson's suit was flawed because Nielson had 
not signed it. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge gave Nielson 30 days to fix his complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Nielson had called those mistakes "typing errors" and said he was sure that he 
could bring back a complaint that would stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
But when Nielson refiled his suit last month, the city challenged it again. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Dougherty said. "If Nielson decides to go forward with the 
lawsuit, we might" challenge its technical merits again.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former UCLA Medical Center employee was ordered to stand trial Thursday on 
charges he shot and killed a co-worker and seriously wounded his supervisor in 
the university's first homicide in 20 years.

<P>
Brian Keith Major, 18, who has pleaded not guilty, is charged with one count of 
murder and one count of attempted murder.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MAY HAVE TO PAY POLICE FOR FAKING 
DISAPPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rialto police said Thursday they are considering making three women who faked 
their own disappearance pay for the $10,000 investigation into what police 
feared was a bloody kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the taxpayers be duped for a harebrained idea like this?" asked 
Rialto Police Capt. Phil Greek. 
</P>
<P>
He said an investigation of the hoax by Suzanne Ballinger, 38, her 17-year-old 
daughter, Sherry Richards, and Sherry's friend, Laura Fleming, 18, cost the 
Police Department about $10,000. Greek said he has asked the city attorney of 
Rialto to look into possibly billing the women. 
</P>
<P>
The three turned up unharmed in Ogden, Utah, Wednesday night, nearly a week 
after they abandoned a blood-stained car in North Hollywood, Greek said. As for 
the motive for the hoax, Greek said Ballinger was seeking sympathy from family 
members. He said she was frustrated with driving two hours to work in Van Nuys 
and was upset about her financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
The department does not plan to file criminal charges against the women.

MAN RETURNS AFTER HOAX DISAPPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Navy air traffic controller whose apparent drowning while surf-fishing off 
Mugu Rock triggered a joint military and civilian search-and-rescue effort last 
week staged his disappearance to escape family problems, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer 1st Class Edwin Loder, 39, turned himself in to superiors at 
Point Mugu Naval Air Station earlier this week after a trip to Washington 
state, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Loder reported her husband missing on the morning of Aug. 19 after finding 
his abandoned fishing tackle and car near Mugu Rock, a 500-yard spit extending 
from the Pacific Coast Highway. Police thought that Loder, who had gone fishing 
the night before, fell into the surf and was swept away by riptides. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department and the Navy sent helicopters and divers to search for 
Loder that day and the next and continued twice-daily flyovers the rest of 
week, Sheriff's Lt. Joe Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Loder returned to the base Sunday night and told superiors that he left the 
area because of family problems, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials had Loder detained to undergo medical evaluation and returned 
him to duty in another job pending a base investigation, said Lt. Commander 
Gene Okamoto, a Navy spokesman. Loder was not gone long enough to be considered 
absent without leave, but could face other charges, Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Harwell said the Sheriff's Department is awaiting the outcome of the Navy 
investigation before deciding whether to file criminal charges against Loder, 
who could be forced to reimburse the department more than $5,000 spent on the 
search effort. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY IN DRUG MONEY CASE SUES OVER 
SEARCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspended Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, who is scheduled to stand 
trial with eight other narcotics officers in a money-skimming scandal, has 
filed a lawsuit contending that local and federal investigators violated his 
civil rights in searching his two homes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Terrell H. Amers and his wife, Genevieve, filed suit Thursday in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles claiming that their Pomona home was illegally 
searched and the couple was harassed, coerced and threatened last September 
during a nine-hour ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Amers said another home in Arizona was searched a month later without a 
valid warrant. Named as defendants in the suit were the county of Los Angeles, 
Sheriff Sherman Block and a dozen local and federal agents investigating the 
money-skimming allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Amers and the other indicted narcotics officers are scheduled to stand trial in 
October. The deputies, who had worked on an elite team investigating major drug 
cases, are accused of stealing more than $1.4 million from suspected drug 
dealers and money launderers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MENENDEZ BROTHERS APPEAL TO HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Beverly Hills brothers accused of the shotgun murders of their parents for 
a $14-million inheritance have asked the California Supreme Court to block 
prosecutors from using a tape of an alleged confession. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Menendez, 19, and Joseph Lyle Menendez, 22, petitioned the high court on 
Wednesday to overturn an appeals court decision permitting prosecutors to take 
possession of a tape made by the brothers' therapist after the slayings of Jose 
and Mary Menendez in their home on Aug. 20 last year. 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court declines to keep prosecutors from using the tape, defense 
lawyers said they will challenge its use as evidence on other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, who deny killing their parents, are being held without bail 
pending a preliminary hearing Oct. 22.

MOBIL CLEANS UP OIL SPILL FROM PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minor spill from a leaking pipe at the Mobil Oil Co. piers 10 miles north of 
Ventura turned white sea foam to a frothy brown along 300 yards of beach early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, a crew of 30 men in white suits had removed the oil from the water and 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
The crew spread spongy booms to soak up much of the estimated 10 gallons of oil 
that seeped through a pinhole in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The spill posed no danger to swimmers and little harm to aquatic life, Ventura 
County Environmental Health officials said. Nevertheless, Mobil was right to 
call out a full cleanup crew, said Greg Smith, specialist in the hazardous 
materials section of the environmental health division of the County Resource 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a small spill spreads out over a wide area," Smith said. "And all the 
small spills add up, so even the little stuff has to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
Matt West, production technician at the Mobil office in Ventura, said Mobil 
discovered the spill about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday. The leak, about 300 yards 
offshore in the pipeline leading from the pier to shore, was stopped, but 
officials did not know the cause of the leak. 
</P>
<P>
"We want this cleaned up as fast as possible," West said. "We would rather have 
overkill than not have enough." JOANNA MILLER

Reconstruction art done by the Ventura County Sheriff Department's crime

identification of the body, Assistant Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran 
said.

The work was done in an attempt to reconstruct the appearance of the skull and 
possibly link it to Jeanetta LaBelle, who is believed to have drowned in San 
Antonio Creek during a flood in 1969.

"A drawing can't be good enough," O'Halloran said. "You can't just draw general

TEACHERS WIN 5.62% RISE IN SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a yearlong labor dispute, teachers in the Santa Paula Elementary School 
District ratified a salary increase Thursday, and the board of trustees 
approved the agreement at its regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will receive an overall 5.62% increase in salaries and benefits, 
retroactive to September, 1989, union and district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The salary increase falls under a contract that expired June 30. Negotiations 
for a new contract will begin this fall, probably in October, said Randall 
Chase, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule includes incentives such as higher salaries for new teachers 
and bonuses for bilingual teachers, designed to make Santa Paula schools more 
attractive to teaching recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Ishida, president of the Santa Paula Federation of Teachers, which 
represents 134 teachers, said most teachers will receive an increase that will 
amount to about 5.42%. The rest of the increase will boost salaries for 
beginning teachers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 99 teachers who voted, six opposed the pay proposal, Ishida said. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said the district's salary schedule "was redesigned because we need to 
increase entry-level and lower-level salaries." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ventura County superintendent of schools office, teachers at 
the Santa Paula Elementary School District earned less under the old schedule 
than those in three other school districts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The increases will bring minimum salaries for most new teachers -- depending on 
their education and experience -- to more than $24,000 a year. The previous 
minimum was slightly more than $20,000 a year. The new maximum salary for 
teachers with 11 years of experience and a master's degree will be $42,331 a 
year, Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
Annual anniversary bonuses for teachers with at least 15 years of experience 
will increase from $975 to $1,000 a year, Chase said. The district will 
continue to pay full health benefits, which have risen by about 6% over the 
past year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new salary schedule includes a $500-a-year bonus for bilingual 
teachers with full credentials, Ishida said. That bonus will increase by $100 
annually, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Costs of the salary increases are expected to be close to $400,000 and will be 
taken out of this year's budget, district officials said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

The Thousand Oaks City Council will discuss Tuesday night whether to issue 
tax-exempt municipal bonds to provide low-interest loans to first-time home 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, buyers would be able to borrow up to $175,000 to purchase 
houses and condominiums in the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the loans, Thousand Oaks would issue $31.5 million in 
tax-exempt municipal bonds to cover 200 loans at 3%-under-market interest 
rates.

To qualify for the loans, buyers must have annual incomes lower than $51,200,

5 ABUSED HORSES RETURNED TO OWNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five abused horses, including two pregnant mares, were returned by court order 
to their owner, Dennis Alamillo of Fillmore, over a protest by the Humane 
Society of Ventura County, which spent five months rehabilitating the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Society Director Joleen Hoffman said that both the Humane Society and county 
animal regulation had documented a lack of food and water for the horses on 
numerous occasions since June, 1989. The horses were impounded March 29, 1990, 
after an examination by veterinarian Dr. A.E. Sloan determined that "the horses 
were not being taken care of in even a minimal capacity," according to a report 
filed with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing Wednesday morning, Alamillo, 28, pleaded no contest to two of 
six counts of animal abuse. Municipal Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. fined 
Alamillo $530 and sentenced him to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed the courts could make such a horrid mistake," Hoffman said of the 
decision to return the horses to their owner. When Alamillo arrived at the 
society's Ojai shelter about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Hoffman found it difficult 
to believe his court order was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy sheriffs were called after Alamillo reportedly threatened to walk his 
animals out through the society's office. Finally, the horses were taken by 
their owner to the corral at the west end of Fillmore's 4th Street from which 
they were impounded. 
</P>
<P>
Alamillo's lawyer, Jan L. Helfrich of Ventura, said the reports of abuse were 
exaggerated and described the horses as thin but not starved. Although the 
paddocks where her client kept the animals have no on-site water, Helfrich said 
that Alamillo brought water in daily and that the Humane Society must have 
impounded the animals on the only day they were without water. Alamillo could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Randall Thomas said the veterinary report on the date the 
horses were taken from Alamillo described the water buckets as dry for at least 
24 hours and containing dried fecal matter. Pictures taken by the Humane 
Society after the horses arrived in Ojai were "compelling," Thomas said. "Two 
of the horses were walking skeletons."

Judge Campbell said the threat of jail on two counts of abuse and the terms of 
probation, which give the Humane Society the right to monitor Alamillo's care 
of the horses, convinced him that "the animals' safety could be ensured." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said her staff remained shaken after the court decision. "We're all 
shocked and depressed about this." She would not comment on the findings of the 
society's first inspection Thursday but said there are plans to file for 
restitution of expenses for the care of Alamillo's animals, which she estimated 
cost the society more than $3,000. JANET BERGAMO

VIOLENCE CLAIMS ANOTHER YOUNG LIFE IN RAMPART DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Pebbles" was a 15-year-old Westlake girl who was shot to death early Thursday 
by a gunman who demanded money from her. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman had chosen Pebbles not for her money, witnesses said, but for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Pebbles was her gang moniker, friends said. Her true name was withheld by 
authorities until her family could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
She had been talking with her boyfriend in front of the Stuart Hotel in the 700 
block of Union Avenue at 3:20 a.m. when a car that had often been seen in the 
neighborhood passed by, turned around and dropped off a young passenger, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and witness reports, the young man went up to Pebbles and 
asked, "Where's the 20?" Before she could respond, he pulled out a handgun and 
started shooting, striking her several times in the head and upper body. 
Pebbles was taken to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, where she died, said 
Rampart Division Police Lt. Doc Warkentin. She is the third youth in the 
division to die violently this month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to detectives, the killing may have been related to drugs -- although 
Pebbles was carrying none when she was shot. Friends and residents living in 
the long-term, tenant hotels that line Union Avenue said Pebbles was a gang 
member, and like others before her, was killed as retaliation by a rival gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"She died for the silliest reason in the world," said a 30-year-old man, who 
identified himself as the boyfriend standing with Pebbles when she was shot. He 
declined to give his name. The gunman wasn't after money, he said; "She died 
for some (thing) that her homeboys did." The boyfriend also declined to say 
what precipitated the killing, only that "she had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Mandy Birseno, 11, who has lived in the neighborhood for two months, said she 
often saw the 4-foot-6, 105-pound Pebbles, who was known as a giggly teen-ager 
with curly brown hair and a pigeon-toed gait. 
</P>
<P>
Birseno said she did not know where the slain girl lived. "I think she stayed 
with different friends," Birseno said. By late Thursday, detectives had yet to 
find anyone in Pebbles' family. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend, too, said Pebbles did not live with her family. But he was 
speaking of the gang that people said she belonged to when he added, "She was 
an Orphan."

UNUSUAL CASE OF DRUG-RAID DEATH IN HANDS OF JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Mack Charles Moore didn't fire the gun that killed Dexter Herbert. In fact, it 
was a Gardena police officer who shot Herbert during a narcotics raid last 
year. But Moore is standing trial for second-degree murder in Torrance Superior 
Court because, prosecutors say, he provoked the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Thursday, prosecutors said Moore should have realized what 
the consequences would be when he turned, with a shotgun in his hands, toward a 
police officer during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Moore turned on the police officer in an angry manner, head Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gilbert L. Garcetti said, prompting the officer to fire his own gun. The bullet 
missed Moore but struck Herbert, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have realized the grave consequences," Garcetti said as he urged the 
jury to find Moore guilty because he provoked the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore's attorney countered in his own closing argument that too many 
questions linger in the case for the jury to find Moore guilty, including the 
question of whether Moore even held a gun in his hands at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one witness who claims to see Mack Moore with that gun, and 
that's Mr. Mathieson," said Moore's attorney, Jeffrey Gray, referring to 
Gardena Police Officer David Mathieson, who shot Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred March 24, 1989, during a police Special Weapons and 
Tactics narcotics raid on a Budlong Avenue apartment in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
According to trial testimony, three Gardena police officers entered the 
apartment moments before the shooting, and several others were on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was at the end of a hallway, his back to Mathieson, allegedly holding the 
shotgun. Mathieson testified that he dropped to one knee, pointed his own 
9-millimeter gun at Moore and ordered him several times to drop the gun. 
Mathieson testified that Moore began to pivot toward him, pointing the gun 
slightly downward. As Moore turned, Mathieson fired, accidentally striking 
Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gray attempted to portray the circumstances as tense and 
anxiety-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what happened: There was an accidental shooting," Gray told the 
jury. "Imagine what it must be like to be a SWAT member -- the intensity, the 
anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
If jurors find Moore innocent, that doesn't mean they have determined Mathieson 
is a "bad guy," Gray added. "All it says is, 'Mack's not a murderer.' " 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, however, returned again to the issue of provocation. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is not an accident," Garcetti said. 
Instead, he said, Moore committed an intentional act that led to Herbert's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and the defense attorney said the provocative act argument is not 
used frequently. The prosecution is using the argument on the grounds that 
Moore, by turning and lifting the gun in the the presence of police, committed 
an act knowing the response could be fatal, Deputy Dist. Atty. Irene 
Wakabayashi said. 
</P>
<P>
Jury deliberations began Thursday afternoon.

SOUTH BAY POSTS MODEST GROWTH IN POPULATION; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: PRELIMINARY FIGURES SHOW A 7.45% INCREASE. SOME CITIES ON THE PENINSULA 
SHOW A DECREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The South Bay posted a 7.45% population increase during the last decade, well 
below the 17% growth recorded by Los Angeles County as a whole, preliminary 
U.S. Census figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, where a flurry of apartment construction in recent years prompted 
city officials to impose a moratorium on new building, recorded the biggest 
population increase at 24%. Lawndale and Inglewood experienced the next largest 
gains, with increases of 14% and 13% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
On the affluent Palos Verdes Peninsula, the census figures portray an entirely 
different story -- a decrease in population in two of the four cities and 
negligible increase in a third. Palos Verdes Estates, for example, experienced 
a 7% drop in population. 
</P>
<P>
Although some peninsula officials said the population declines were 
foreseeable, UCLA associate professor of urban planning Leo Estrada questioned 
whether the census figures are accurate. Competing demographic trends, such as 
an increase in the Asian population, should have canceled each other out and 
showed the cities slightly gaining in population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We see no signs to indicate there should have been a decline at all," Estrada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 7.5% increase in the South Bay's population includes 15 cities. Excluded 
from the figures released this week are the unincorporated county area of 
Lennox, and the San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City and Harbor Gateway 
communities, which are part of the city of Los Angeles. Those numbers have yet 
to be broken out of the larger census figure, which showed that the city of Los 
Angeles recorded a 15% increase in population during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Avalon on Santa Catalina Island is not included, either. Census officials 
are still tabulating figures for that city. 
</P>
<P>
Of the county's 86 cities, Palmdale and Lancaster topped the list in growth. In 
Palmdale, the population exploded from 12,297 to 65,357, a 432% increase. In 
Lancaster, the population grew from 48,027 to 95,101, a 98% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary figures can be challenged by cities, and may be adjusted by 
census officials in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
David Heer, a professor of sociology at USC and an authority on demographics, 
said he believes the preliminary census figures are basically "on target." He 
said he has been examining the difference in population counts taken by census 
officials and the state's Finance Department. Based on his analysis of 
demographic trends, he believes the state generally underestimated the 
population in cities that are mostly Latino or becoming more Latino and 
overestimated the population in cities that are mostly Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
Heer said that when an area experiences an increase in its Latino population, 
the typical household size increases. Although 1990 Census data on household 
ethnicity and size is not yet available, the 1980 Census showed that the 
average Latino household had 3.7 members, while Anglo families had 2.5 members, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, associate planner Bill Barnett said the city's increasing Latino 
population is an important factor in the community's population growth. 
Although new housing has been built during the past decade, redevelopment 
projects in areas affected by jet noise from Los Angeles International Airport 
have actually demolished some housing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our net change in units has not been that appreciable," Barnett said, adding 
that "it's the population within the units that is changing." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne officials said they were uncertain if ethnic changes were responsible 
for their city's population growth. They added that the city's population surge 
during the past decade coincided with a large number of new apartments being 
built. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the census estimated that there were 23,907 dwelling units in the 
city, and Hawthorne officials now estimate the number to be just over 29,000. 
In January, Hawthorne officials, worried that police, paramedic and other city 
services were being severely strained because of the growth, imposed a 
moratorium on apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had tremendous growth and we were aware of that," Mayor Betty 
Ainsworth said. "The growth has been so rapid, and we could not keep up the 
services." 
</P>
<P>
The census figures show little growth in several South Bay cities -- Torrance 
experienced a 2% increase, Manhattan Beach a 1% increase and Hermosa Beach no 
increase. And on the peninsula, Rolling Hills, like Palos Verdes Estates, 
experienced a declining population, the census figures showed. Population in 
the private, gated community declined by 6%, according to the census figures. 
In neighboring Rolling Hills Estates, the population increased by a scant 2%. 
</P>
<P>
The census figures show a 13% increase for Rancho Palos Verdes, but the figure 
may be skewed because the city annexed the Eastview area from Los Angeles 
County in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 8,000 people reside in the annexed area, so the city's population 
should have jumped from its 1980 Census count of 36,577 to 44,577 when the land 
was acquired. The census data released this week show the city's 1990 
population to be 41,486, suggesting a decline has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Mel Hughes said he believes the actual population of 
the city may have been underestimated by census takers. "It's not clear to me 
they really know where the (city) boundaries are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes and others living on the peninsula said a decline in the area's 
population from 1980 figures would not surprise them because the population is 
aging and high real estate prices prohibit most young people from moving there. 
</P>
<P>
"In an affluent area like the peninsula is, there aren't too many people with 
families who can afford to live here," Palos Verdes Estates City Clerk Barbara 
Culver said. "The school district has been declining in the last 10 years to 
about half of what it once was, as far as numbers of children. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Proposition 13 (the 1978 initiative that cut property taxes), we have an 
increasing number of elderly. They've been able to stay in their homes rather 
than be forced to sell because of rising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Estrada, however, said he believes the census figures that indicate 
population declines in the peninsula cities are wrong. He said the 
"suburbanization" of Asians and Latinos into the South Bay should have 
compensated for such factors as an increase in single parents, widows and 
widowers and baby boomers reaching adulthood and moving from their parents' 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought these (would) play off each other," Estrada said.

FELANDO MAY VACATE HIS ASSEMBLY SEAT IN 1992 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six-term South Bay Assemblyman Gerald Felando says his run for reelection this 
year may be his last. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Felando said that although he has not yet made a final 
decision, he is thinking about serving just one more two-year term -- assuming 
he wins reelection on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"With another two years, that gives me 14 years in the Assembly," the 
55-year-old San Pedro Republican said. "I think it might be time to step aside 
and let someone new with fire in their guts take a stab." 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which state legislators have proven virtually invulnerable to 
electoral challenge, Felando's comments raise an unusual prospect -- wide-open 
competition for a local Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
"An open seat would bring candidates out of the woodwork," said Manhattan Beach 
City Councilman Bob Holmes, who is weighing a run for the Assembly in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Felando said his consideration of a 1992 departure is not prompted by his 
recent bout with a rare form of cancer or by the possibility that voters this 
fall might approve ballot proposals limiting the number of terms lawmakers can 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer, a form of lymphoma called mycosis fungoides, has been in remission 
for over a year, Felando said. And since the two ballot questions that would 
affect legislative terms are not retroactive, neither would prevent him from 
seeking an eighth term. 
</P>
<P>
Felando said his only reason for considering a change of course is that he 
believes by 1992 it may be time for new leadership in his 51st Assembly 
District. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will not make a final decision until after the fall election, 
however: "I have to sit down and think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Two challengers are scheduled to face Felando on Nov. 6 -- Democrat Marilyn 
Landau and Libertarian William Gaillard. Landau said she doubts Felando's 
comments about bowing out of the Assembly will affect the race. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks, however, are likely to stir interest among South Bay politicos 
eager to run for an open Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
At least two South Bay Republicans are hoping to compete for Felando's 
political turf, a largely Republican area that includes Torrance and coastal 
areas from Manhattan Beach to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Banking on the possibility that Felando will forgo an eighth term, Holmes, a 
Republican, has already begun notifying supporters that he is considering a run 
for the Assembly in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, another Republican, also expresses 
interest in running for the Assembly, although he says he will make no move to 
run until Felando decides to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made absolutely no secret of my enjoyment of public office," Walker 
said. "If the people were to support me for higher office, I would enjoy that 
equally well." 
</P>
<P>
Walker was preparing to run in the 51st District in 1988, when Felando was a 
candidate for the 42nd Congressional District seat. He abandoned the effort 
after Felando dropped out of the congressional race and opened another bid for 
reelection to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Felando were to announce today that he is leaving the Assembly in 1992, 
the shape of that race would be clouded by a major question: how the district's 
lines will be redrawn next year to account for population shifts reflected in 
the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, for instance, could find himself in the heavily Democratic 50th 
Assembly District if that district, now represented by Curtis Tucker Jr., is 
pushed south from El Segundo to include Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The more immediate question for would-be candidates, however, is whether 
Felando will run in '92. Said Holmes: "Clearly, one would have to have a death 
wish to run against a Republican incumbent in a Republican district."

$400,000 AWARDED FOR STREET REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $400,000 federal grant has been awarded to the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency for street improvments in a six-block area of Wilmington 
Industrial Park, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Economic Development Administration funds, coupled with a matching $400,000 
from the CRA, will go toward repairing C Street and Lecouvreur Avenue with 
sewers, storm drains and paving. 
</P>
<P>
The work is scheduled to be completed by June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park was designated a CRA project by the Los Angeles City 
Council in 1974 with the aim of converting the area's dirt roads, junkyards and 
vacant land into a business center. Since then, according to the CRA, 28 new 
commercial buildings have opened in the project area, generating nearly 1,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The latest grant, applied for two years ago, will allow further improvements to 
the area, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Opening up C Street will provide the community and industrial park workers 
with more access to businesses within the park, as well as make the area more 
attractive and functional," Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said in a prepared 
statement released after the grant was announced. Flores' district includes 
Wilmington.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN PUSHES FOR 'BIG GREEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein on Thursday called for 
support of Proposition 128 -- a sweeping environmental measure on the November 
ballot -- as a way to force Los Angeles County officials to improve treatment 
of sewage before dumping it into the ocean off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"California is growing, and unless we do right by the environment, I really 
believe it will be an ecological Armageddon," said Feinstein, who was joined by 
representatives of environmental groups at a press conference on the Santa 
Monica Municipal Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, known as Big Green, would require full secondary treatment of 
all sewage dumped into the ocean by the year 2000, and would no longer allow 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts has not been required to fully 
treat its sewage because its application for a waiver, first submitted in 1979, 
has been tied up in appeals with the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
The delay, environmentalists charge, has resulted in a de facto waiver for the 
district, which discharges 355 million gallons of sewage daily with only 56% of 
it receiving secondary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, Feinstein's campaign released a statement charging 
that when Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson was mayor of San 
Diego, he fought the federal clean water program. The result, the statement 
said, was a $2.5-billion cleanup bill, and "the quarantine signs that go up 
around Mission Bay one out of every four days of the year stand as a living 
testament to the lack of executive leadership in that city a decade ago." 
</P>
<P>
But when she spoke, Feinstein talked only of her efforts as mayor of San 
Francisco to build a new sewer system, noting that "others have not done that. 
They have fought the clean water act. They have gotten their ocean waivers. 
They have clung to those ocean waivers." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said he opposes Proposition 128 because it creates a new post for an 
elected environmental czar. But Feinstein said that is merely an excuse for 
Wilson to avoid supporting the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unreasonable to have someone designated by the voters who will be 
forthright, direct with the electorate and will move Big Green into fruition," 
Feinstein said. "What it does is guard against a governor who may be lethargic, 
a governor who doesn't want to put their hands on the issue, or even a governor 
who may be opposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the issue-oriented tone of the morning, gubernatorial 
partisans spent the afternoon exchanging accusations about campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
The state Republican Party filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against 
Feinstein and her husband, Richard C. Blum, alleging the couple's loans of more 
than $3 million to her campaign violated state contribution laws. While not 
filed by Wilson's campaign, the effort dovetailed with Wilson's attempts to 
call Blum's and Feinstein's financial dealings into question. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein's office quickly produced letters from the state's campaign 
watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices Commission, showing that as early 
as last year the FPPC had approved the use of such loans. Earlier this month, a 
complaint against the couple was dismissed as groundless, the FPPC said. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party argues that the loans came from Blum's assets and should 
not be allowed under the $1,000-per-person limitation. The Feinstein campaign 
argued -- and the FPPC agreed -- that an unlimited amount of money could be 
donated if it came from community-property assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein campaign later released a statement publicly demanding that 
Wilson, one of California's two U.S. senators, return more than $2 million in 
donations from corporations to his gubernatorial campaign. The statement noted 
that such donations are not allowed under federal law.

BALLOT QUANDARY: SALES TAX MEASURES EXCEED LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State senators moved Thursday to correct a quandary on the November ballot that 
could have Los Angeles County voters approving local sales tax increases that 
it may be illegal to collect. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is this: State law requires that the total sales tax collected, 
excluding a temporary earthquake tax, cannot exceed 7%. 
</P>
<P>
A 6 1/2% tax is now being collected in the county. But on the ballot are two 
measures -- one for jails and one for transportation -- that each call for 
local half-cent sales tax increases. If both pass, the total sales tax would be 
7 1/2%, above the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) attached amendments to a 
rail transit bill that provide that if both Los Angeles County sales tax 
measures pass in November, both would carry an increase of 0.25%, rather than 
0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has a problem," said Robbins. "Both of the (tax) proposals seem to 
be doing well and if both pass the maximum will be exceeded. Therefore the 
question is, if they both pass, what happens? No one knows." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he made the move at the request of the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors and county transit and jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
But if the measure wins final approval in the Senate it will move back to the 
Assembly, where Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said 
he will argue against it. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said officials would be misleading the voters if they ask them to approve 
a half-cent sales tax increase which may turn out to be only a quarter-cent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens when you wait until the last minute to do things," he 
said.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He walked into the crowded room, past the silver coffee urns and the plates of 
little cookies, to "open a dialogue" with about 200 Long Beach residents. His 
first mistake was on his upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
A mustache. The very thing that led the Walt Disney Co. to fire several of its 
Queen Mary employees just last year, perched boldly under the nose of David 
Malmuth, executive in charge of Disney's proposed plan to build a $2-billion 
theme park in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"How come you get to wear a mustache?" a woman from the audience demanded to 
know. Malmuth blushed. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code doesn't apply to executives, he tried to explain. The answer was 
about as well received as a traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Malmuth, Disney's mild-mannered provost for the Long Beach venture, had come to 
the first of what is to be a year's worth of open community meetings to explain 
this thing called Port Disney and to allow the people who live here to air 
their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
At times, it seemed less like an airing of feelings than a baring of teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"The way things sound right now, Disney is trying to take over our front of the 
ocean!" Belmont Heights resident Stanley Kaufman boomed. "I think Disneyland is 
working very much for Disneyland!" 
</P>
<P>
"Here, here!" someone in the audience brayed, and half the room burst with 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is months away from deciding whether to build a theme park around the 
Queen Mary or next to Disneyland in Anaheim, pitting the leaders of both cities 
in a sort of bidding war. But already, Long Beach's citizenry is divided over 
whether a 350-acre Disney resort will make their city or break it. 
</P>
<P>
As sure as there is a faction of residents that regards Disney as a cold and 
profit-hungry corporation, there is a faction that sees a corporate savior 
descending on a town with its back to the fiscal wall. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not mistaken, this town has been very, very fortunate to have McDonnell 
Douglas as a major employer," one resident said, pointing out thousands of 
recent layoffs at the aircraft plant. "I think we would be foolish if we didn't 
take a very, very fair look at the opportunity to advance the good will of this 
city in a partnership with Disney." 
</P>
<P>
More applause. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, Long Beach voted down a zoo," another woman said. "Now we go to Los 
Angeles and San Diego. Are we supposed to live here and work here and spend all 
our entertainment dollars outside the city?" 
</P>
<P>
The city is in financial trouble. A poor retail sales tax base translates into 
millions in lost revenues, while the need for more police, health care and 
other services is exploding. 
</P>
<P>
"This community will need a fiscal engine to drive it into the 21st Century," 
City Manager James Hankla said at a recent Disney presentation before the Long 
Beach area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done about all we can do with the reserves at our disposal, and the 
reality is we need more. In 30 years, there hasn't been a project that has at 
once excited me and to a certain extent frightened me like Disney." 
</P>
<P>
The question Long Beach needs to answer about Disney, Hankla said, is this: 
"Will the juice be worth the squeeze?" 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of other questions on the lips of Long Beach residents 
already. 
</P>
<P>
Will Disney recycle? Will Disney pollute? Will the theme park be free of 
plastic-foam cups? Will Disney hire Asians, Latinos and blacks? Will 17,000 
cars from a Disney parking lot strangle Long Beach streets into gridlock? 
</P>
<P>
The questions came during three community presentations -- one a docile, 
invitation-only meeting with the local chamber; a second closed-to-the-press 
session with community and business leaders aboard the Queen Mary, and the 
third, an open public meeting arranged by the Belmont Heights Community Assn. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people showed up full of questions and, in some cases, speeches. A 
community liaison hired by Disney scribbled notes on three giant pads; Malmuth 
painted an enticing picture of a resort that he promised would bring "tens of 
thousands of new jobs and tens of millions in new revenue" to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"When all is said and done, if this project doesn't strengthen this community, 
it's not a plan you will support," Malmuth said, "and we need your support."

SYMPHONY'S POPS SALUTE RINGS FALSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the San Diego Symphony's summer season was announced last spring, the 
theme for this week's pops program vacillated between the overtly militaristic 
and the benignly nautical. 
</P>
<P>
It started out with a military emphasis, but when the pops program book went to 
press last month, "Splash on the Bay" was the chosen theme. Then, in light of 
the recent military deployment in Saudi Arabia, guest conductor Andrew Massey 
took the opportunity Wednesday night to stress the military character of the 
pieces still left over from the original plan. He also dedicated the concert to 
the men and women of the American armed forces. Richard Rodgers' "Victory at 
Sea" and Franz von Suppe's "Light Cavalry" overture were prominent on the list 
of military salutes. 
</P>
<P>
Patriotism did not ensure good music, however. Rodgers' smug orchestral suite, 
written for a 1952 television documentary depicting the glories of the American 
naval forces during World War II, was the kind of facile, jingoistic music 
contrived long after the grim realities of combat had faded. The symphony's 
seamless performance did justice to the composer's style, but such musical 
platitudes rang false with the threat of war looming in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's most respectable offering Wednesday was Wagner's overture to 
"The Flying Dutchman." Despite Massey's ponderous tempo, the orchestra infused 
the tuneful composition with shapely melodies and an unusually expansive air. 
The brass section, bolstered by the return of principal trumpet Calvin Price, 
supplied apt Wagnerian grandeur. Massey and the orchestra also played marches 
by Edward Elgar and John Philip Sousa, choices appropriate to the guest 
conductor's English origin and his current post as music director of the Fresno 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, the program included unobjectionable renditions of Percy 
Grainger's string arrangement of "Londonderry Air," Lee Holdridge's "Love 
Theme" from the movie "Splash" and a pastiche of motion picture themes from the 
pen of Franz Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Menken's five-movement suite from "The Little Mermaid," a saccharine grab 
bag of insipid cliches, marked the absolute nadir of pops programming this 
season. "The Little Mermaid" should carry a warning label advising its lethal 
threat for anyone with so much as a diabetic symptom. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance at Hospitality Point was reported at 1,895.

AT THE GALLERIES: SHOW CELEBRATES 'RENAISSANCE' OF COMPUTER ART

<P>
Both jubilation and disdain greeted the arrival of photography 150 years ago -- 
jubilation at the new medium's astonishing technical abilities and disdain that 
the products of a machine could merit status as works of art. 
</P>
<P>
That same, simultaneous chorus of cheers and hisses now accompanies the 
computer's entrance into art's hallowed terrain. Since the mid-1980s, when 
personal computers opened up a playground of visual opportunities to the 
non-professional user, computer art has emerged as a promising, albeit 
beleaguered field. 
</P>
<P>
Few galleries feature computer art alongside work in more traditional media, 
though nationally-known artists such as Nancy Burson and Esther Parada have 
enhanced the credibility of the medium through many museum and gallery shows. 
</P>
<P>
Starting tonight with the opening of the city's first gallery devoted 
exclusively to computer art, the medium will have a more prominent place in the 
local landscape. The Verbum Gallery of Digital Art, upstairs at 670 7th Ave., 
opens with a public reception from 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the gallery's first season, its promoters extend their welcome to 
"the new renaissance in fine art" brought about by the computer. The pretension 
of the claim may be merely an example of promotional rhetoric, but it's bound 
to trigger the defenses of those who resist the computer's spreading tentacles 
of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gosney, director of the gallery and founder in 1986 of Verbum magazine, 
a journal of personal computer aesthetics, attributes such hostility to 
"computer-phobia, the overall resentment people have against the onslaught of 
computers in every realm of life. Art has always been a sacred area, and, for 
some people, it's the last straw for computers to get into art." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County artist Michael Johnson, whose work is featured in the gallery's 
first show, sees the problem in terms of the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"Galleries are in business to sell art, and if they have a product that sells, 
they don't want to think about changing it," by introducing something as 
controversial as computer art. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Johnson conceded, computer art "has a stigma." Its first products, dating 
as far back as the 1950s, were technically dazzling geometric designs. 
Relatively few people are aware of how the medium has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
Gosney's efforts in the field have intended to help clarify this growth, to 
mark the distinction between an earlier era of computer graphics and newer 
computer art. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he organized "Imagine," a traveling exhibition of computer art that 
was seen locally last year at United States International University. The show 
revealed a wide range of techniques and concerns among artists using computers, 
from the obsessively technical to the painterly and poetic. 
</P>
<P>
Gosney's choice of artworks for the gallery's inaugural season reflects a 
similar breadth. Some exploit the digital look, he said, and some don't. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's small, dye transfer prints only discreetly reveal their 
computer-aided technique. For each image in his series on the myth of Leda and 
the swan, Johnson combines, via computer, several staged photographs. 
Overlapping transparent images, water reflections and other features lending to 
the dreamlike quality of the images are also manipulated with the help of the 
computer. The finished prints, however, appear to combine photography and 
painting, and have little resemblance to the digital imagery of the computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Johnson's large ink-jet prints, approximately 23 inches by 29 
inches, make no secret of their electronic heritage. The prints, also from the 
Leda and the swan series, have a grainy -- or in computer language "pixellated" 
-- surface that could only be the product of a machine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this fact, Johnson calls his works paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"People might complain that there's no brushwork or surface that shows the 
artist's hand, but after there's enough computer art out there, they'll get 
used to looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
"I've just found a tool with which I can express myself with a little more ease 
than traditional painting materials. I'm making the exact same decisions about 
line and composition and color. The only thing different is the stroke." 
</P>
<P>
Gosney, whose own artistic experiments with the computer prompted his immersion 
in the field, affirms Johnson's sentiments in his own "first principle of 
computer art: The computer does not make the art, the artist makes it. The 
computer is a tool." 
</P>
<P>
Programs do exist that generate designs, colors and compositions, but Gosney 
dismisses these as novelties. What interests him is what he calls the 
"Macintosh aesthetic," the notion that "the computer should serve you, it 
should think like you." The Verbum Gallery, like its sister magazine, whose 
offices it wraps around, aims to showcase "pioneering applications" of computer 
art, but Gosney promises not to become blinded by impressive technique. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to just show off the tools, but to show off the content and 
creativity achieved with these tools. Computers are part of our lifestyle, like 
it or not. They're everywhere. What we're doing is celebrating the creative 
side of the medium. We're carrying the flame for a really human touch to all of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
CALL FOR PROPOSALS: Sushi's new visual arts coordinator has issued a call for 
proposals to San Diego-area artists. Jason Tannen, who was active in artists' 
organizations in Cincinnati before coming to San Diego last month, aims to 
bring to the downtown performance and visual art gallery's exhibition program 
"a solid mix of local, regional and national artists and artists' projects." 
</P>
<P>
He invites proposals in the visual, media and installation arts, with no 
restrictions on content or form. Exhibiting artists will receive hon o ra ri 
ums . San Diego-area artists are encouraged to arrange for a studio visit or 
appointment. The deadline is November 16. 
</P>
<P>
Call Sushi at 235-8466 for more information or send a self-addressed, stamped 
envelope to SUSHI Visual Arts Program, 852 8th Ave., San Diego, CA 92101 for 
guidelines and proposal form. 
</P>
<P>
ART DEMONSTRATION: Japanese artist Kazuaki Tanahashi will demonstrate 
one-stroke calligraphy using a huge handmade brush on Friday, Sept. 21, from 7 
to 9 p.m. at the David Zapf Gallery, 2400 Kettner Blvd. A suggested donation of 
$5 will benefit the California School of Japanese Arts, where the artist 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"When a line is alive," Tanahashi has written, "you always feel the breaths of 
the artist as well as the breaths of the brush. . . . Every brush stroke must 
be decisive, with no going back. It's just like the things we do in life." The 
artist's demonstration will be preceded by a slide lecture and signing of his 
latest book, "Brush Mind."

MIDEAST DEBATE CREATES RIFT IN O.C. DELEGATION; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: DANNEMEYER IS NOT SURE BUSH MADE RIGHT DECISION. ROHRABACHER AND DORNAN 
ARE AMBIVALENT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deep rift among conservatives over the Bush Administration's massive 
military buildup in the Middle East has penetrated Orange County's usually 
united congressional delegation, underscoring the national right-wing debate 
over America's role in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), echoing concerns raised by 
conservative columnists Patrick J. Buchanan and Robert Novak, is uneasy "about 
sending young Americans into a situation where they have little or no 
interests," Dannemeyer spokesman Paul Mero said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mero added that Dannemeyer, who is scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia today with 
a 22-member congressional delegation, is not certain that President Bush made 
the right decision when he dispatched 50,000 troops to Saudi Arabi after Iraqi 
troops overran neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"That is unclear in his mind," Mero said, "given the budgetary considerations 
and the energy considerations. . . . There is a big question mark when we get 
about 10% of our oil from the Middle East and Japan gets 90%." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's four other congressmen -- Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) and Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), all conservatives -- said they support the 
President's decision, as do nearly all of the conservatives in Congress. But 
Rohrabacher and Dornan also expressed some ambivalence about the military 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred that we change the law restricting assassinations," 
said Rohrabacher, who represents the coastal section of northwestern Orange 
County, "and instead of sending tens of thousands of American troops to the 
Arabian peninsula, that we simply assassinate (Iraqi President) Saddam 
Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
But, Rohrabacher added, "considering the limitations that Congress has put on 
the Central Intelligence Agency, I think (President Bush) has acted with 
courage and he's acted very responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dornan: "Americans don't die for sultans and emirs, and we shouldn't be 
dying for foreign oil when we're locking up our coastlines in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're the only superpower left in the world, and when a little country, 
however flawed its government, is swallowed whole by an aggressor nation, that 
cannot go unanswered." 
</P>
<P>
The American response to Iraq's invasion of oil-rich Kuwait has split the 
nation's conservative movement like no other crisis in recent memory, 
conservative leaders said. In some cases, conservatives who support the 
military action find themselves agreeing with traditional liberal opponents and 
taking exception with fellow conservatives who question the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is a watershed, and I think it may be that the conservative 
movement really may not quite ever look the same again," said Tom Bethell, 
Washington editor of the American Spectator, a leading conservative journal. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are conservatives such as Buchanan, former director of 
communications in the Ronald Reagan White House, who seemingly echo the 
"America First," non-interventionist philosophy of the late Robert A. Taft, the 
conservative Republican senator from Ohio who died in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is that Americans are not to be sent into battle unless America's 
vital interests are engaged: not the interest of some vague new international 
order, or some Utopian democratist ideology," Buchanan recently told the 
Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are conservatives steeped in the "stop-Communism" brand of 
international interventionism championed since the early 1950s by right-wing 
stalwarts such as William F. Buckley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"For the 40 years of the Cold War, from 1947 until 1989, conservatives would 
say, 'We know why we're engaged in the world. We are there to defeat the Great 
Satan,' " said Burton Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation, 
a conservative research center that strongly supports the military buildup in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
As the influence of the Soviet Union has diminished, "we are now in the stage 
as conservatives of asking, 'What further justifies America intervening in the 
world?' And this is a debate in its early stages." 
</P>
<P>
Pines added, "On the calculus that I have here, yes, it is appropriate for the 
United States to be involved in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who agree is Cox, who represents central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the view that we have no business there at all, then you're ceding 
Saudi Arabia to Saddam Hussein," Cox said. "Isolationism has always been a 
flawed world approach, and it is increasingly so as the world becomes more 
interdependent." 
</P>
<P>
Bush deserves "very high marks for marshaling the formal support of most of the 
world's governments, as well as world public opinion, behind the defense of 
Saudi Arabia," Cox added. But he said the final judgment of the President's 
handling of the crisis must wait until it is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"His strategy remains to be seen, so it is certainly premature to be 
unqualifiedly praising the (military) exercise, or critical of it," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, who represents southern Orange County, said: "I continue to be very 
supportive of Bush's approach. I think he's handled it very well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the United States can withdraw and take an isolationist 
position. I think it would be a tragic mistake at this juncture, when the 
Soviet Union is becoming less and less of a superpower. It's time for the 
United States to take the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer leaves for Saudi Arabia today with a House delegation headed by 
majority leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). The only Californian in the group, 
Dannemeyer was chosen because of his membership on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, a Gephardt spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives will get a military briefing in Bahrain, a small island 
nation just off the Saudi Arabian coast, and then travel to nearby Dhahran in 
Saudi Arabia to inspect U.S. troops and meet with Saudi officials. Later, they 
will fly to Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak before 
returning to Washington on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has expressed outrage that U.S. troops are protecting oil production 
facilities in the Middle East when, he said, environmentalists in the United 
States have blocked exploitation of offshore oil resources and contributed to a 
continuing dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather explain to a parent why we have offshore drilling 
expanding off our coasts than I would explain why we sent their child to a 
foreign land to defend oil largely consumed by Japan and Western Europe," the 
Fullerton Republican said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan also expressed exasperation with environmentalists, suggesting that more 
oil drilling should be authorized in Alaska. A former advocate of increased 
drilling off the California coast, Dornan has reversed that position in recent 
months.

REPUBLICANS: When campaign warfare time comes every two years, nobody is 
stronger than Orange County Republicans, who outnumber Democrats nearly 2 to 1 
(above). . . . Before the Nov. 6 vote, local GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes is 
expecting visits from the President, vice president, governor, U.S. senator and 
former President Ronald Reagan. First up is Dan Quayle, due Oct. 25. "That's 
why I've always said how futile the Democrats' efforts are in this county, 
because they don't have the galaxy of big stars," says Fuentes.

COUNTY PLAN OFFICIAL UNDER INVESTIGATION BY STATE FPPC; 
</P>
<P>
GIFTS: C. DOUGLAS LEAVENWORTH'S DEALINGS WITH THE MISSION VIEJO CO. ARE BEING 
REVIEWED IN RELATION TO CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Planning Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth's relationship with 
a major development company is being examined by the agency chiefly responsible 
for enforcing California's conflict-of-interest law, according to an agency 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the matter under review," said Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. "We have a case open." 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said the FPPC's scrutiny of Leavenworth was prompted by an Aug. 10 
story in The Times, reporting that the commissioner may have violated state law 
in 1987 and 1988 by voting on matters affecting the Mission Viejo Co. within a 
year after he accepted $365 worth of gifts from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth voted 22 times during 1987 and 1988 on matters directly affecting 
the Mission Viejo Co., according to Planning Commission records. Each time, he 
voted in favor of the company's position. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions affecting a gift 
giver for 12 months after the value of those gifts reaches or exceeds $250. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said the FPPC would conduct interviews "if necessary," but she 
declined to elaborate further on what the agency's review could entail. The 
FPPC could levy maximum penalties of $2,000 per violation if it found that 
Leavenworth violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's case is in addition to a review of Leavenworth opened two weeks ago 
by the Orange County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice L. Evans said the FPPC's involvement "is 
not going to affect us at all. We'll do what we think is right. At some point, 
maybe we'll be able to coordinate our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office announced on Wednesday that it would not 
prosecute two other county planning commissioners, Roger D. Slates and Stephen 
A. Nordeck. The two were found not to have violated a state law that prohibits 
planning commissioners from soliciting campaign money on anyone's behalf from 
individuals with matters pending before them. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Leavenworth has denied that his decision-making has been 
influenced by the gifts from the Mission Viejo Co. Records show the firm gave 
him $1,207 worth of golfing privileges, meals and theater and sports tickets 
during the period from 1984 to 1989. Reached at his home on Thursday, 
Leavenworth said he was unaware of the FPPC's review. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," he said, "I would like to see the thing resolved as quickly as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth has also said, in a letter to Evans, that he did not knowingly 
violate any law but that his actions were "careless and inattentive with 
respect to some very significant and reasonable rules." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 16, Leavenworth amended his gift-disclosure report encompassing 1987 to 
revalue the gifts given to him by the Mission Viejo Co. In his revised 
disclosure statement, Leavenworth says the gifts from the development firm were 
worth $242.50 -- a reduction that placed his total $7.50 under the state law's 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth said the reductions were attributable in part to his originally 
estimating the gift values "on the high side." The commissioner also said that 
he had not been required to report gifts that he said the Mission Viejo Co. 
intended for his wife, such as when she accompanied him to a ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's five planning commissioners are appointed separately by members 
of the Board of Supervisors and serve open-end terms. The supervisor 
responsible for Leavenworth's tenure, Don R. Roth, indicated Thursday that he 
has not yet made a decision regarding Leavenworth, based on the commissioner's 
explanations and amended gift report. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard anything from the D.A.'s office," Roth said. "When I hear, 
then I will evaluate" Leavenworth's future on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth, a retired aerospace engineer originally appointed to the Planning 
Commission in 1982 by then-Supervisor Ralph Clark, and reappointed by Roth in 
June, 1987, said in a recent interview that he has enjoyed his years on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge," Leavenworth said, recalling his appointment eight years 
ago. "I had retired early and I had the time. . . . I feel like I'm performing 
a service -- and it makes me feel good."

AMBURGEY INVITES KEMP TO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Orville Amburgey on Thursday challenged Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Jack Kemp to a friendly debate on the issue of illegal 
aliens but conceded that neither he nor Kemp is likely to change his view on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Amburgey said he will seek an opinion from U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh on Kemp's authority to suspend sections of immigration law that 
require screening of a person's immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey contends that the provisions support his position that the city can 
lawfully require organizations that receive federal money to screen their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
"As an elected official, I've sworn an oath to respect the laws of my city, 
state and nation," wrote Amburgey in a letter mailed Thursday to Kemp. The 
letter was in response to a missive from Kemp to Amburgey outlining the 
secretary's opposition to screening out illegals from receiving emergency 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"Your letter instructs that the line between legal and illegal must be obscured 
when applied to laws governing legal residency in this county. Our city does 
not want to bear the burden of unsafe, unhealthy overcrowding of public 
facilities by those who do not have the legal right to be in this country," the 
letter continued. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp has said he would agree to meet with Amburgey to discuss the issues but 
could not be reached for comment Thursday on Amburgey's invitation for a 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey and Kemp have engaged in an increasingly lively, though lopsided, 
debate over illegal immigration and what, if anything, local governments can do 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
The debate stems from the city's attempts a year ago to deny grant money to 
charities and other groups unless they pledged not to serve illegal immigrants. 
The city eventually rescinded the policy when questions were raised about its 
constitutionality. CARLA RIVERA

10 GALLONS OF OIL SPILL NEAR PLATFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 10 gallons of oil spilled near offshore oil platform Emmy late Thursday 
afternoon, but it was quickly contained by booms around the platform and poses 
no immediate threat to city beaches, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the accident were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials had not determined if the spill came from the platform, 
owned by Shell Oil. 
</P>
<P>
"It was crude, but we don't know from where yet," Coast Guard Lt. Jim Pearson 
said. "All we know is it's near the platform." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said Shell officials promptly notified 
the city Fire Department of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the situation is under control," Mays said. "This is just a 
small spill, and they have booms all around it." A commercial oil-removing 
firm, Clean Coastal Waters, dispatched a boat from Long Beach to scoop up the 
floating oil. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said the incident Thursday adds to his concern about the safety of the two 
offshore oil platforms that face city beaches. He noted that in June about 180 
gallons of oil washed ashore, staining parts of Bolsa Chica State Beach, 
immediately north of the city. The source of that oil spill has not been 
determined officially. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been wary of oil at sea since the Feb. 7 rupture of the tanker 
American Trader caused almost 400,000 gallons to spill into the ocean about 1.3 
miles off Huntington Beach. BILL BILLITER

Travelers planning to use John Wayne Airport this Labor Day weekend were urged 
Thursday to arrive as early as possible because of the holiday crowds, airport 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Thanksgiving and New Year's, the Labor Day weekend always produces one 
of the biggest jams of the year at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's count came to 42,208 passengers for the three-day weekend, with a 
similar number expected this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials urged travelers to arrive at least two hours before their their 
flight departures and to arrange to be dropped off rather than drive or leave 
their cars in the airport parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Moving around the airport is expected to be a little easier now, however, 
because a new ramp leads traffic leaving the airport directly onto the 
northbound Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The new $62-million Thomas F. Riley Terminal is scheduled to open on Sept. 16, 
after a Sept. 8 open house. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

BURGLARY SUSPECT SHOT BY OFFICER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of breaking into a market was shot and wounded by a policeman 
Thursday after allegedly attacking the officer with a screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Lopez, 19, was listed in fair condition Thursday afternoon after 
undergoing surgery at UCI Medical Center in Orange for a bullet wound in his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was not injured, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating a false alarm at a Target store in the 1800 block of 
West Lincoln Avenue at about 4 a.m. Thursday when two people ran up to the 
squad car and alerted officers to a burglary in progress at a food store a 
block away. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the market, the officers spotted a car speeding away with two young 
men inside, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
The police car chased the suspects two blocks to Euclid Avenue and the Santa 
Ana Freeway, where the driver of the suspects' car lost control and the 
automobile rolled over, landing on its roof. After the car skidded to a stop, 
the suspects climbed out and began running. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers chased Lopez to North Manchester Avenue, an industrial area 
bordering the Santa Ana Freeway. After cornering him at 300 N. Manchester, the 
officer pulled out his handgun and ordered Lopez to surrender, but the suspect 
turned and lunged at the officer with a screwdriver, Barry said. The two were 
struggling when the officer shot the suspect at point-blank range, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's 16-year-old companion was found by officers a short time later, hiding 
in a commercial storage area, Barry said. Food and other items were found in 
the overturned car, which was later determined to have been stolen from an 
Anaheim resident. No firearms were found on the suspects or in the car, Barry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and the 16-year-old, whose name was withheld because of his age, were 
arrested on suspicion of burglary, auto theft and evading a police officer, 
Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the shooting, the 
16th this year involving a uniformed peace officer in Orange County. JAMES M.

4 TEENS ARRESTED IN BURGLARY OF CLUB

<P>
Four teen-agers were arrested by sheriff's deputies Wednesday morning in 
connection with a burglary at the Mission Viejo Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Robert Matsen of Laguna Niguel and Michael David Miller of Laguna Hills, 
both 18, and two 16-year-old males were charged with stealing about $4,000 
worth of golf clubs and other golf equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Police were alerted by a neighbor who heard an alarm at the clubhouse about 
3:30 a.m. Wednesday, Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Several patrol cars responded to the call and arrived at the country club, 
26742 Oso Parkway, just as the suspects were driving away in two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies stopped a black 1980 Saab being driven by Matsen near Oso Parkway and 
Interstate 5. One of the juveniles also was in the car, in which deputies found 
several pieces of golf equipment, Olson said. A few minutes later, deputies in 
another patrol car stopped a red 1988 Ford Bronco heading north on I-5 just 
past the Oso Parkway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the truck's driver was Miller, and the other juvenile was a 
passenger. More golf equipment and golf clubs were discovered in the vehicle, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Matsen were being held in the Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 
bail each. The juveniles were released to the custody of their parents. FRANK

LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT SWORN IN AS PLANNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William J. Cathcart, a landscape architect and former Chamber of Commerce 
president, has been chosen to replace David Hart on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart, president and partner in the architectural firm Cathcart/Begin 
Associates Inc., was sworn in by Mayor Don E. Smith this week at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart said he will try to bring a new perspective to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"In the landscape architecture profession, we are not environmentalists per se 
but we are not on the developer's side either," he said. "We believe that the 
environment must be protected, but if all the 'Ts' are crossed and the 'I's' 
are dotted, a planned community is permissible." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles native, Cathcart, 46, has lived in Orange for the past 18 years. 
He and his wife, Deputy City Clerk Cassie Cathcart, live in central Orange with 
their son, Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart graduated from Cal Poly in Pomona in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in 
environmental design. 
</P>
<P>
He is a former president of the Chamber of Commerce and Orange Kiwanis Club and 
chaired the traffic circulation committee for the citywide planning project, 
Orange 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Cathcart replaces David Hart, who resigned from the commission in May. MARY

2 ARE POSSIBLE SUSPECTS IN SHOOTING OF POLICEMAN 
</P>

<P>
A college football player and a university student are under investigation as 
possible suspects in the Aug. 4 shooting of an off-duty Huntington Beach 
policeman and a string of San Diego County robberies this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Arrington and Hubert Phillips were charged Thursday with armed robbery 
stemming from three holdups Tuesday morning -- of a doughnut shop and a motel 
in Escondido and the robbery of a cabbie in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, a star senior fullback with the Southwest High Raiders in San Diego 
two years ago, was redshirted the next year with the University of New Mexico 
football team. Arrington attended Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Ala., last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, both 19, pleaded innocent Thursday to the armed robbery charges. 
They are being held on $100,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were arrested after a 50-mile freeway chase that ended when 
their car crashed. 
</P>
<P>
A third young man, 17-year-old Cahill Muhammad, was found dead in the back seat 
of the car, the victim of what police Thursday called a self-inflicted gunshot 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are trying to determine if the men were involved in a string of up 
to 15 robberies in the last six weeks, including the one at a motel on Kearny 
Mesa Road in which Huntington Beach policeman Robert Barr was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at them in connection with that . . . and other robberies," San 
Diego Police Lt. Paul Ybarrando said. "But we haven't yet established if they 
are responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Barr was hospitalized for some time after he was wounded -- in the arm and leg 
-- at the motel. Having been told the motel was full, he was leaving when three 
masked gunmen charged into the lobby and ordered several guests to the floor, 
demanding everyone's wallets. 
</P>
<P>
Barr told investigators that, fearing the intruders would kill him if they 
discovered his police badge in the wallet, he tossed it beneath a lobby chair. 
When the gunmen ordered him to remove the contents of his pocket, he drew a gun 
on robbers and fired. He missed and was shot at close range. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Huntington Beach officers said Barr is continuing to recuperate at 
home and is walking on crutches. It is not known when he will return to work.

Orange Coast College has named John J. Waters, an associate professor of 
machine technology for 14 years, as director of the college's new Center for 
Applied Competitive Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The center is one of eight high-tech centers in the state started at community 
colleges in the last year to provide technical training and consultation to 
local small and medium-size manufacturing firms. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast's center will help firms improve the skills of their employees and 
the quality of their products. 
</P>
<P>
The college received $90,000 from the state and other sources to establish the 
center. That amount will be repeated for the next three years to maintain the 
center and allow it to buy equipment needed to train students and employees in 
the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, 43, worked as a machinist for two large companies and taught industrial 
arts at El Dorado High School before being hired by Orange Coast College in 
1976. He developed the curriculum for the college's computerized numerical 
control program. 
</P>
<P>
"Many small to medium-size firms work as subcontractors for large 
general-contracting firms," Waters said. "We'll assist those firms in improving 
the quality of the products they supply to general contractors."

<P>
Police arrested four Long Beach teen-agers early Thursday morning in connection 
with the shooting of a tow truck driver at an automated teller machine and the 
robbery of a woman at a 24-hour supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Riley, 18, and three juveniles, ages 14, 16 and 17, were arrested on 
suspicion of attempted murder and armed robbery, said Buena Park Police Sgt. 
Terry Branum. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the four were also involved in the robbery of a man at a 
Bellflower pool hall earlier in the night. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys, I guess, were all over the place," Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Fuller, 44, of Westminster, was listed in fair condition at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange with a bullet wound in his lower back, hospital spokeswoman 
Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller was returning home from work shortly after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday when he 
parked his tow truck at the Beach Boulevard branch of Home Savings &amp; Loan 
to withdraw money from an ATM, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Once he completed his transaction, Fuller was approached by four teen-agers who 
demanded his money, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
When Fuller refused and began running, one of the youths pulled out a handgun 
and fired once, wounding him, Branum said. The four fled without taking any 
cash from Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes after Fuller was shot, the suspects drove their 1976 Cadillac 
Seville into the parking lot of a 24-hour supermarket at the corner of Lincoln 
and Knott avenues, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
As they "cruised the parking lot," Branum said, the suspects saw two women walk 
out of the store and get into a car, Branum said. But before the women were 
able to drive away, one of the suspects got out of the car and robbed one of 
the women of her purse. 
</P>
<P>
They drove off, heading west on Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, Branum said, a Cypress police officer spotted the 
Cadillac near the intersection of Cerritos Avenue and Moody Street. 
</P>
<P>
Tailing them a few blocks, the officer pulled the Cadillac over and detained 
the four occupants for Buena Park police. 
</P>
<P>
The victim of the supermarket robbery, a 38-year-old Rancho Dominguez woman, 
was able to identify the four teen-agers, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the car turned up a .22-caliber pistol believed to be the weapon in 
the shooting of Fuller and two credit cards that belonged to the woman, Branum 
said. The pistol was reported stolen in Arizona two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's discarded purse and other personal belongings were found at the 
intersection of Valley View Street and Los Molinos Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officers searching the Home Savings &amp; Loan parking lot found a 
wallet belonging to a Bellflower man who had earlier reported being robbed at a 
Bellflower pool hall. 
</P>
<P>
The wallet was being checked for fingerprints to compare them to those of the 
four suspects.

Westminster High School suffered what might have been an inevitable defeat in 
its season-opening football game Thursday night. Unable to establish a consist 
offense, and victims of numerous letdowns on defense, the Lions lost to Robert 
E. Lee High, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Lee quarterback Brian Gegg's seven-yard touchdown run with 53 seconds remaining 
gave the Lancers the victory on their home field. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Westminster Coach Stan Clark stood at midfield and counted the 
faults of his football team. 
</P>
<P>
It took him some time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we played good at times and I know we played poor at times, but all I 
can remember are the poor times," he said. "We can't afford more of those poor 
times this year." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster's Matt Bailey, one of three quarterbacks used by the Lions, said 
changing defensive alignments by Lee confused his team. 
</P>
<P>
"One play their ends were coming in and putting pressure on us, the next play 
they were stacking up the middle," he said. "We didn't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who platooned with starter Kirk Pierce, finished with three completions 
in eight attempts for 21 yards and one interception. Pierce was five-for-nine 
for 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's winning drive covered 74 yards and took 13 plays. Twice during the 
Lancers' march, it looked as if Westminster had stopped them, but a slippery 
ball and an improbable tipped pass conspired against the Lions and extended 
Lee's drive. 
</P>
<P>
On first down from midfield, Lee fullback Terrill Anderson burst up the middle, 
but had the ball stripped from his hands. Three Lion defenders pounced on it, 
but the ball squirted out from beneath them and into the hands of Lee lineman 
Greg Ostinato. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the drive, on fourth and 12 from the Lions' 26-yard line, Gegg rolled 
to his right and fired a pass to Anderson along the left sideline. The ball 
glanced off Anderson's fingertips to teammate Jim Adamouski, who carried it 
down to the nine-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Gegg dove into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was the highlight of Lee's offense, finishing with 123 yards. Running 
back Gabe Blevins led Westminster's running attack with 32 yards in five 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' only points came with 7:25 left in the fourth quarter when Bailey 
scored on a three-yard rollout. The score was set up when linebacker Sal 
Fernandez recovered a Lee fumble at the 26. 
</P>
<P>
Lee took a 7-0 lead by scoring on its first possession after the half. Gegg 
scored on a one-yard run, capping a 10-play, 61-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the second meeting between the schools in three years. Westminster 
won, 14-0, here in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams struggled in the first half. Each team managed three first downs and 
combined for 77 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to forget this game," Bailey said. 'We can't let this get 
us down."

Bolsa Grande 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Holst (third year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 5-6, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 8 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four on offense, four on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jeff Miller, QB-DB, 6-0, 155, Sr.; Lepage Moaliitele, OG-LB, 
5-10, 180, Jr.; Marcus Wilson, RB-LB, 6-1, 200, Sr.; Maurice Wilson, RB-DE,

6-0, 175, Jr.; Steve Lim, WR-DB, 5-7, 140, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: As the Wilson twins go, so goes the Matadors' offense. The Wilsons are 
the key weapons in Coach Holst's triple option, which this season will have 
Miller at quarterback. Moaliitele is the class of an offensive line that 
includes 305-pound tackle Rayme Manuele. The team will feature a 4-4 defense 
led by linebackers Marcus Wilson, Moaliitele and Matt Leituala. The Matadors 
will find out how they size up with the rest of the league in a hurry. They 
face Rancho Alamitos in their league opener Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jeff Buenafe (third year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 3-7, 1-6 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 15 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Five on offense, five on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Dennis Amunson, RB, 6-1, 175, Jr.; Brent Brodhagen, RB, 5-11, 
205, Sr.; Brian Brodhagen, LB, 5-11, 200, Sr.; Scott Fridley, OG, 5-11, 170,

Sr.; Brian Swogger, WR, 6-5, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: John Fonseca, DT, 5-10, 225, Jr.; Raul Gonzales, DB, 5-8, 150, 
Jr.; Adrian Ioja, TE, 6-3, 212, Jr.; Mike Knee, C, 6-0, 176, Jr.; Doug Pluard, 
LB, 5-10, 185, Jr.; Bob Rosa, RB, 5-10, 145, Jr.; Glenn Sorensen, LB, 5-11, 
175, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Argonauts have finished seventh, eighth and seventh the past three 
years, winning one league game in that stretch. Buenafe is not optimistic about 
the new season. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mitch Olson (third year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 5-5, 4-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 11 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Vince Church, RB-DB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Scott Jones, WR-DE, 6-1, 
175, Jr.; Mark Leach, C-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Morgan Murakami, WR-DB, 5-10, 170,

Robert Togais, OG-DE, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Joe Youkhan, OT-DT, 6-3, 275, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: R.J. Gonzales, WR-DB, 6-2, 165, So.; John Guthrie, QB-DB, 6-1, 
170, So.; Ray Mobley, RB-DB, 5-10, 170, So.; Ed Montchaikul RB-DB, 5-10, 165, 
Jr.; Ryan O'Connor, OG-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Church, an all-league running back who last season ran for 641 yards 
and 11 touchdowns, is the team's mainstay. He has 4.5 speed in the 40 yards and 
plays a mean cornerback, the position where Olson says he's a a Division I 
college prospect. Youkhan adds muscle at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Roger Takahashi (fifth year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 9-5, 5-2 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 14 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One on offense, seven on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Eman Bayani, OT, 5-10, 220, Sr.; Walter Dawkins, RB-DB, 6-0, 
165, Sr.; Garett Frisby, OT-DG, 6-3, 185, Sr.; Don Hopkins, QB-DB, 6-0, 175, 
Sr.; Greg Livermore, LB, 5-9, 185, Sr.; Craig Reynolds, LB, 5-11, 170, Sr.; 
Jorge Sanchez, RB-DB, 5-9, 157, Sr.; Joe Slouka, DE, 5-8, 159, Sr.; Justin 
Sogoian, TE-P, 6-4, 180, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Sam Barbee, DB, 6-2, 165, Jr.; Bill Boulton, LB, 5-10, 180, Jr.; 
Brock Dehart, OL, 5-11, 160, Jr.; Steve Quach, WR, 5-7, 135, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: What the Aztecs lack in size they make up with speed. Quach, promoted 
from junior varsity, is the fastest player on the team. The offense is suspect, 
but the defense is solid, anchored by all-league selection Reynolds and by 
Sanchez, who had five interceptions last season. Dawkins will figure in both 
the offensive and defensive backfields. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Michalik (seventh year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 2-8, 1-6 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 10 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Six on offense, four on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jeff Lavere, OT-DT, 6-0, 275, Sr.; Matt McCready, TE-LB, 6-3, 
220, Sr.; Derrick Ragsdale, RB-DB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Ethan Siddall, QB, 5-10, 155, 
Sr.; Roger Wojceichowski, OT-LB, 5-11, 225, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Dan Grudt, TE-LB, 5-11, 155, Jr.; Mike Thayer, RB-LB, 5-7, 150, 
Jr.; Andre Roberson, WR-DB, 6-4, 190, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Lobos shared last place last year with Garden Grove, but Michalik 
sees better things ahead for his team. "We are going to surprise some people," 
he said. "I'm happy with the team." Contributing to the coach's cheerfulness 
are Ragsdale and Siddall, who will be entrusted with making Michalik's power-I 
and split-backs offense work, and McCready. Wojceichowski leads an 
inexperienced offensive line. He also will help out on defense, along with 
McCready and Thayer. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Craven (14th year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 8-2-1, 7-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 23 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jason Blade, DB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Ryan Bremer, TE-LB, 6-0, 190, 
Sr.; Chris Castellano, QB, 5-11, 160, Sr.; Mike Christie, DB, 6-2, 180, Sr.; 
George Figueredo, C, 5-11, 210, Sr.; Matt Langenfeld, OG-DT, 6-1, 230, Jr.; 
Chris Maroney, LB, 6-0, 185, Sr.; C.T. McDonald, OT, 6-3, 220, Sr.; Derek 
Nicholson, RB, 5-11, 160, Jr.; Dave Selof, OT, 6-2, 220, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Eric Stevens, WR, 5-11, 155, Jr.; Eddie Thompson, OG, 6-2, 215, 
Sr.; Dan Thomas, DE-DB, 6-1, 180, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Craven doesn't rate his team among the league favorites, but others, 
namely Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller, are not taking the lure. Said Miller: 
"He (Craven) says the same thing every year." The Fighting Irish have only six 
returning starters, but with 23 returning lettermen, there's got to be some 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mark Miller (fourth year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 4-6, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 17 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Nine on offense, eight on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Eric Moore, TE-DB, 6-4, 190, Sr.; Vince Otteman, RB-DT, 5-9, 
190, Sr.; Leonard Sims, OT-DE, 6-2, 240, Sr.; Chris Singletary, QB-LB, 6-1, 
225, Sr.; Tim Starke, LB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Lia Togia, OG-LB, 6-1, 220, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Marshall Brown, WR, 6-0, 160, So.; James Cabral, OT, 5-9, 215, 
Jr.; Luther Tolbert, DB, 5-8, 170, Jr.; Ulysses Trammell, RB, 5-7, 140, Sr.; 
Leon Vickers, RB, 6-0, 175, So. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Running back Dana Riddle, who carried the ball 381 times last year, 
has graduated. But the Vaqueros have plenty of returning starters, including 
all-league members Sims, Starke and Otteman. Much of the Vaqueros' hopes ride 
with senior quarterback-linebacker Chris Singletary, who's back after breaking 
his leg in the opening game of the last season. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Paul Allen (first year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 4-6, 3-4 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 17 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Five on offense, 10 on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Mike Carrasco, QB, 6-0, 181, Jr.; Jaime Estrada, LB, 5-11, 182, 
Jr.; Kevin Gilliam, RB, 5-8, 175, Sr.; Nicky Levale, RB, 5-11, 216, So.; Scott 
McGarrh, WR, 5-11, Jr.; Dang Nguyen, LB, 5-10, 165, Sr.; Joe Polman, LB, 6-2, 
211, Sr.; Noa Utu, LB, 6-2, 212, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ben Espinoza, OG, 5-10, 187, So.; Minh Nguyen, OT, 5-10, 195, 
So.; Ngan Nguyen, C, 6-1, 205, So.; Travis Tisor, RB, 5-9, 173, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: In his first year at as Santiago coach, Allen, an assistant coach at 
Whittier College the past three years, is trying to revitalize a team that 
hasn't finished higher than fifth the last two seasons. To do so, he'll have to 
depend on all-league linebackers Polman and Utu, both of who are on major 
college material because of their size and speed, to solidify a defensive unit.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO ALAMITOS WILL TRY TO KEEP PACIFICA AWAY FROM A 'THREE-PEAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacifica High School hasn't lost a Garden Grove League football game in two 
seasons, but the Mariners aren't bold enough to chant "three-peat" quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, coming off two 7-0 league seasons, , are looking for a third 
consecutive title and another playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacifica will have to survive the challenges from a league that is more 
balanced than in previous years, one that includes Rancho Alamitos, a team many 
league coaches consider the one to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"We are somewhat familiar with the character of their (Rancho Alamitos') 
athletes. They have good attitudes and talent," said Bill Craven, who begins 
his 15th year as coach of Pacifica. "It could be one of the best clubs they've 
had in many years." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Mariners? 
</P>
<P>
"We might have a little bit of potential, but we don't have the depth that 
we've had in the past," he said. "Defensively, we have a lot of question 
marks." 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica has 23 returning lettermen but only six returning starters. Gone are 
quarterback Bobby Anderson, whose 1,415 yards passing last year ranked fourth 
in the county's all-time single-season list, and Chris Shockley, who ran for 
1,154 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
To pick up the slack, Craven will rely on senior quarterback Chris Castellano 
to run a multiple pro-set offense, and on junior tailback Derek Nicholson for 
the ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Castellano throws the ball pretty well and he understands our system well," 
Craven said. "He (has) paid his dues and now we are going to put him in and see 
what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicholson has some pretty big shoes to fill. He's an I-formation type of 
runner, so we'll utilize that formation more than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pacifica was upset, 10-0, by Corona del Mar in the first round of the 
Division VI playoffs last year, Craven still has one of the most impressive 
high school coaching records (112-40-5), 11 postseason appearances and 10 
championships in the Garden Grove and Empire leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been fortunate to have consistency with our coaching staff and the 
players," Craven said. "Success breeds success. You don't do it without the 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of tradition is what Coach Mark Miller has been trying to build at 
Rancho Alamitos the past three seasons. This could be the year when it pays 
off. 
</P>
<P>
After tying with Santiago for fifth place in the league with a 4-6 mark, the 
Vaqueros appear primed for their finest hour. They have 17 returning starters 
and a host of talented newcomers. If experience is an accurate measure of a 
team's potential, Rancho deserves the team-to-beat label it has received. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to be the best team in Rancho's history," said Miller, who was 
somewhat skeptical of his colleagues' optimism about his team. "I think the 
other guys (coaches) are setting me up." 
</P>
<P>
Miller will count with the services of Chris Singletary, an all-league 
quarterback as a sophomore in 1988 but nothing more than an interested 
bystander last season after he broke a leg in the opening game. The injury 
forced Miller to focus the offense on the running game behind Dan Riddle, who 
led all county rushers with 2,082 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With Riddle graduated, the Vaqueros will hand the ball in their new veer 
formation to senior tailback Ulysses Trammell, a 9.8 sprinter in the 100 yards, 
and to sophomore Leon Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
When Rancho Alamitos passes the ball, Singletary's primary target probably will 
be sophomore wide receiver Marshall Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best receiver I've ever coached," Miller said. "He still has a lot to 
learn, but he'll be a real game-breaker." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was equally generous in his praise of Trammell: "He's a little guy but 
an exciting guy to watch. I brought him up to varsity for the last couple of 
games last year and he almost broke a kickoff return for a touchdown the first 
time he touched the ball." 
</P>
<P>
To help the little guys -- and the bigger ones -- get into the end zone, the 
Vaqueros will count on senior tackle Leonard Sims (6-feet-2, 240 pounds), 
junior guard Lia Togia (6-1, 220) and senior tackle Eduardo Lopez (6-0, 200). 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he'll have a better idea of how good the Vaqueros are after their 
non-league opener Sept. 7 against Troy, the Freeway League runnerup in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can play against them, we can play against anybody," Miller said. 
"That'll be a good indicator." 
</P>
<P>
And if everything pans out for Pacifica and Rancho Alamitos, their 
season-ending mano a mano on Nov. 9 will be a schedule-maker's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow: Orange League.

LUCZAJ, READY TO BUILD, WANTS PAST TO BE HISTORY AT BUENA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of a production error, a number of copies of Thursday's Times of Orange 
County were distributed without the Freeway League prep football preview. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luczaj knows what to do with the artifacts of a losing football program 
-- relegate them to the dumpster of history. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about the past," Luczaj said from his office at Buena Park High 
School. "We don't deal with the past. We've tried to change anything that we 
possibly, humanly, know how and that's what we do." 
</P>
<P>
At Buena Park, where Luczaj is attempting to right his second Freeway League 
football program in 10 years, there's a lot of negative history to bury. The 
Coyotes last qualified for the playoffs in 1981. Until last season, they hadn't 
won a league game since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in 1981 during his first year at Fullerton High, Luczaj has attempted 
to wipe away reminders of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, there's no talk of the 28 consecutive league losses, a 
six-season streak that ended last year. The white helmets of years past have 
been replaced by green ones and new jerseys have been acquired. Luczaj enlisted 
the players to clear out and wash the weight room "from the roof to the floor" 
so it could be re-painted. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a part of Luczaj's psychological sales job -- trying to convince 
players at a school with little football tradition that they can be successful. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Luczaj took over a struggling Freeway League football program, he 
led Fullerton to the league championship in 1981, but it might not go so 
smoothly the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Luczaj isn't the unknown sophomore team coach he was when he 
took over at Fullerton. Luczaj may have been out of Freeway League football 
since he resigned at Fullerton after the 1986 season, but his reputation as a 
resuscitator of football programs is still strong. 
</P>
<P>
For another, with the players the Coyotes have returning, Buena Park doesn't 
figure to challenge the consensus favorites -- Sunny Hills and Troy. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sunny Hills didn't lose a game until it met the eventual Division 
VI champion, Corona del Mar, in the semifinals of the playoffs. And the Lancers 
likely will be strong again despite losing all-division running back Brian 
Pizula, who gained 1,226 yards and scored 19 touchdowns during the regular 
season, and the bulk of their offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Overby, who gained more than six yards per carry last season, and Mike 
Sullivan, who gained more than eight per carry as a wingback, should pick up 
the slack for the Sunny Hills running game. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the season Troy, which has qualified for the playoffs in John 
Turek's first six years as coach but has never won a league championship, 
breaks through. Warrior quarterback Greg Windle was a first-team all-league 
selection as a junior and his receivers, Steve Friedrich and Chad Hartford, are 
two of the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunny Hills and Troy, the league is difficult to handicap. La Habra 
missed the playoffs only three times in the '80s, but one of those times was 
last season, and the Highlanders will have to replace their quarterback and two 
top rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Buena Park, Fullerton and Sonora have new coaches this season. Former 
Chaffey College defensive coordinator Pat Ward takes over at Fullerton, which 
finished third last season, and former San Gabriel Coach Terry Cox assumes 
responsibility for Sonora, which finished last.

With D.C. Olsen, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound linebacker, Fullerton has one of the 
league's best hitters -- he set a county record with 13 home runs and batted 
.595 for the Fullerton baseball team last season -- and his move from the 
offensive line to fullback likely scares many a defensive coach. 
</P>
<P>
Cox has tried to bolster Sonora, which has only seven returning lettermen, by 
disbanding the sophomore team and promoting the players to the varsity. Cox 
said only 23 of the 41 players truly belong on the varsity. Quarterback Ryan 
Lewis, who missed the league season last year with an injured shoulder, returns 
and he'll be protected by two of the bigger linemen in the league, Scott DeBie 
(6-2, 245) and Robert White (6-5, 270). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Medellin, a part-time starter at quarterback last season, is one of only 
three experienced offensive players for Buena Park and the Coyotes' defense is 
just as green. 
</P>
<P>
"It dawns on me every time I look out at practice that we're not very big and 
not very fast," Luczaj said. 
</P>
<P>
But Luczaj said he is glad to be back coaching football in the Freeway League. 
He returns after two seasons as baseball coach at Fullerton High and two as an 
assistant coach for the Fullerton College football team. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj resigned the Fullerton High football job partly because he couldn't get 
any assistant coaches hired as full-time teachers, and he doesn't have any 
assistants who aren't walk-ons this time around. But his assistants, two of 
whom are Coyotes' assistants from last year, are experienced, Luczaj said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park's program is in similar shape as Fullerton's in 1981, Luczaj said, 
and the players are taking to the system well. But the tradition of losing runs 
deep at Buena Park, which last won a Freeway League football championship in 
1965.

<P>
Outlook: The Coyotes ended a 28-game league losing streak last season, but they 
still have only won one league game since 1983 and last made the playoffs in 
1981. Without defensive back/running back Malcolm King (Cal State Fullerton) 
and linemen Jim Perricone (Cal State Fullerton) and Jason James (Fresno State), 
who earned Division I football scholarships, the Coyotes lose quite a bit of 
talent, but returning quarterback Medellin and a two young running 
back/linebackers, Barrios and Starks, give Luczaj reason for optimism.

</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Kelle Whitehurst, TE-DE, 6-3, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: In his first head coaching position, Ward, the defensive coordinator 
at Chaffey College the past three years, will be faced with the task of 
replacing quarterback Rene Arias, a three-year starter and three-sport 
all-league player. But Ward says junior Daniel Chacon, who played cornerback 
last year, will be a capable replacement. And of course, the Indians have D.C. 
Olsen, possibly the league's best athlete, at linebacker.

Jr.; Jason Johnson, RB-DB, 5-9, 160, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Highlanders missed the playoffs last season for the first time 
since they forfeited two league games in 1987. Greg Mitchell, starting free 
safety and backup quarterback last season, takes over at quarterback for Mark 
Moreno. Whether they can return to playoffs probably depends more on the young 
runners who replace Mark Brown and Jeff Besinaiz, who gained more than 1,300 
yards between them last season.

Fletcher, DL, 6-2, 185, Jr.; Kurtis Lucero, DB-WR, 5-10, 165, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Cox is faced with a task that humbled five coaches during the 1980s -- 
turning around Sonora's football program. Cox, the former San Gabriel coach, 
replaces Larry Allen, who resigned after winning one league game in two years. 
Cox says attitudes have improved. Among those who should contribute are 
quarterback Lewis, who injured his shoulder and missed the league games last 
year, and Drake, who gained more than 2,000 yards in two years for lower-level 
teams.

David Wilde, DB-WR, 5-8, 170, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Marlon Womack, RB, 6-2, 195, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Leading rusher Brian Pizula has graduated. But with Overby and 
Sullivan, who each averaged more than six yards a carry last season, returning 
to the backfield, the defending league champs' ground game shouldn't suffer 
despite the loss of linemen Robert Sung (6-1, 235), Darren Correll (6-2, 255) 
and Pat Marshall (6-1, 230). On defense, where the Lancers shut out six 
opponents last season, the situation on the line is unclear. But Devaney is 
confident in the linebacker corps, headed by Overby, and the secondary, which 
includes Sullivan and Choe, a three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Turek (seventh year)

Returning lettermen: 20 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Nine on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Greg Windle, QB, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Steve Friedrich, WR-DB, 5-11, 
170, Sr.; Chad Hartford, TE-DB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Chad Brasington, RB, 6-1, 195, 
Sr.; Jeff Dorsz, OL, 6-5, 255, Sr.; Robert Blankmeyer, OL, 5-10, 200, Sr.; 
Bodie Berg, C, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Ryan Russell, WR, 5-8, 145, Sr.; Marty Gomez, DE, 
5-10, 175, Jr.; Robert Long, DT, 6-1, 190, Sr.; Bryan Ferguson, LB, 6-1, 180, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jim Falletta, TE-LB, 6-4, 205, Jr.; Roger Cruz, DL, 6-2, 220, 
Sr.; Brent Coon, DB-RB, 6-1, 185, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With Windle (the league's top quarterback), Friedrich (one of the top 
receivers), tight end Hartford and flanker Russell (both second-team all-league 
receivers), running back Brasington and all but two of the offensive line 
returning, Troy might have the firepower to challenge Sunny Hills, the 
defending champions.

EECO REVEALS PLAN TO REPAY ITS CREDITORS

<P>
EECO Inc., the computer products maker that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection in May, said Thursday it has filed a reorganization plan to repay 
creditors and hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Scott O. Davis, chief financial officer, said the plan calls for the company to 
pay $7.5 million to its largest secured creditor, Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles, 
and take out a loan of $3.5 million to satisfy the remainder of Sanwa's 
$11-million claim. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy its second-largest creditor, businessman Gary Beeson, the company 
will turn over ownership of its computer keypad manufacturing plant in Phoenix 
to Beeson, who is owed $6.5 million from the sale of his video-editing business 
to EECO. The company plans to lease back the facility from Beeson. 
</P>
<P>
The company's unsecured creditors claim they are owed a total of $9.5 million. 
Davis said the plan would pay unsecured creditors an amount equal to about 11 
cents on the dollar. That amount would be paid in a note tied to the expected 
sale of EECO's hotel computer subsidiary and EECO stock. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bergh, attorney for the creditors committee, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Santa Ana and EECO creditors.

FASHION ISLAND MALL WILL GET NEW MANAGERS;

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rouse Co., which operates Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, South Street 
Seaport in New York City and other well-known shopping venues, will manage the 
Irvine Co.'s Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The companies recently signed a 10-year management contract with options to 
renew. Rouse replaces Donahue Schriber, a Newport Beach developer that oversaw 
the recent renovation of the mall. How much Rouse will be paid was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, of Baltimore, has also worked for several years with the Irvine Co. to 
develop a big mall at the company's Spectrum industrial park at the junction of 
the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine. But the mall project has been 
delayed because the Irvine Co. has been unable to sign up enough department 
stores for anchor tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue Schriber is a developer of shopping centers and malls around Southern 
California, including two centers in Tustin that the company is developing for 
the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue Schriber officials say the company is no longer interested in managing 
the Fashion Island mall because it generally does not like to manage other 
firms' properties on a long-term basis. And, the developer says, it's busy with 
its other development projects, including the Irvine Co.'s Tustin Marketplace 
shopping center, which is still expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, the largest publicly held developer in the nation, operates 78 malls and 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
It specializes, though, in splashy retail centers such as Faneuil Hall and 
South Street Seaport, in which old downtown buildings are renovated and filled 
with stylish shops that appeal to tourists as well as local residents. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse will assume management of Fashion Island on Sept. 1. The company named 
Richard Oliver, the general manager of the company's Owings Mills, Md., 
shopping center, to manage Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-store Fashion Island, built in 1967, had been losing sales to the newer 
and glitzier South Coast Plaza mall in Costa Mesa for years. Both of the malls 
cater to affluent shoppers with stores such as Neiman Marcus at Fashion Island 
and Tiffany's at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., a giant Newport Beach-based landowner, began renovating Fashion 
Island several years ago, and the new version recently opened.

JOSEPH N. BELL: WWII PILOTS ALIGHT FOR ART OF THE DOGFIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of a local art gallery didn't seem, at first, to be the stuff of 
which columns are made. The invitation came with a bunch of junk mail, and I 
almost threw it away. But a name caught my attention. One of the "honored 
guests" was to be Col. Bud Mahurin, a leading ace in World War II and the 
highest-ranking American pilot to be shot down behind enemy lines in the Korean 
War. 
</P>
<P>
I went to high school with Bud Mahurin. He was a year ahead of me at South Side 
High of Ft. Wayne, Ind. I didn't know him well, but we were acquainted and had 
a lot of friends in common. I hadn't seen him for almost 40 years. So I went to 
the opening. And I had a hell of a time. 
</P>
<P>
For three blissful hours I was carried back into the romance of the last holy 
war in the company of German and American fighter pilots who fought each other 
one-on-one in the sky in the type of combat we will never see again. 
</P>
<P>
Because I was a Navy pilot in the same war, I'm a member of this very select 
fraternity -- even though the edge was taken off by the fact that I was 
transferred from dive bombers to transports before going overseas. This 
probably saved my life, but Navy ace Richard Best, who was also an honored 
guest, called it "bad luck," which paralleled my own feelings at the time. 
</P>
<P>
All these aging hotdog pilots were gathered for the premiere of the Virginia 
Bader Fine Arts West Coast Gallery in Costa Mesa. The Bader Gallery displays 
only art relating to World War II aviation, which seems a rather narrow focus 
but has been enormously successful for Bader, a blond, amiable Englishwoman 
whose cousin was the fabled British ace, Douglas Bader, who became an RAF wing 
commander with two wooden legs. 
</P>
<P>
Bader ran an art gallery in London until she decided to make a living from her 
consuming avocation, World War II aviation art. She went from air show to air 
show selling this art and setting up symposiums for the aces of that war. 
Interest was so strong that she opened a successful gallery in Alexandria, Va., 
10 years ago and has now opened a West Coast branch in Costa Mesa -- and moved 
her home here. 
</P>
<P>
She says, "People have more nostalgia for World War II air combat than any 
other era," and judging by the crowd attending the opening, she may well be 
right. The pilots who came from considerable distances to support their friend 
-- Gen. Guenther Rall flew over from Germany -- were a tremendous magnet for 
the visitors, signing autographs and telling war stories indefatigably. 
</P>
<P>
I looked up Bud Mahurin, first -- a remarkably well-preserved 70 -- to swap 
reminiscences of Indiana and mutual friends. I was startled to find that he 
lives in Newport Beach and directs an organization called the National Security 
Industrial Assn., which he tried unsuccessfully to explain to me in the din of 
the growing crowd. We parted with plans to get together for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, another guest had sat down near me, an 83-year-old German named 
Hanns Scharff, who was known to American pilots as The Interrogator -- and once 
wrote a book by that title. His job in World War II was to interrogate all 
captured American pilots, and he did it with such astonishing success that the 
U.S. Air Force brought him over here after the war to find out why their pilots 
had been so easy to break down. That was in 1948, and he's lived here ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Scharff looks like he was sent over from Central Casting to play a Sydney 
Greenstreet-like character in German, a heavy-set man with thick lips, hooded 
eyes and an air of amiable menace. "The Americans opened up to me," he 
explained, "because they were conditioned by their own Intelligence to believe 
we would do bad things to them. They were scared, and when we were nice to 
them, they talked freely." 
</P>
<P>
Scharff said that after his book was published, a number of American pilots he 
had interrogated looked him up. One was also a guest at the opening, a slight, 
animated man with a ready laugh named Hub Zemke. He's an almond farmer now in 
Northern California, but he is still the quintessential American kid, who wins 
some and loses some and doesn't take any of this very seriously. He greeted 
Scharff like an old friend. Zemke was shot down on Oct. 31, 1944, parachuted 
safely, and soon after was given the Scharff treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting bread shoved through a hole in the cell wall," he recalled, 
"when all of a sudden I was ushered into this guy's" -- gesturing at Scharff -- 
"plush office. He was sipping tea and blowing smoke in my face and talking 
softly, and he asked me if I'd like some tea and a cigarette. Hell, we were 
pushovers for this guy. We thought we were over there playing baseball! Show us 
a little friendliness, and we'll talk about anything!" 
</P>
<P>
This good-natured feeling permeated the gathering, a sense of gladiators who do 
their damnedest to knock off their adversaries, then raise a cup to them when 
it is over. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dashing was Guenther Rall, Germany's third leading ace in 
World War II with 275 kills, who retired a few years ago as the head of the 
West German Air Force. Rall is a man of modest size, full of zest and good 
humor, with a ruddy face, sparkling eyes, and a ready smile. His only visible 
mark from all those years of air combat is a missing left thumb that was shot 
off in the last year of the war. 
</P>
<P>
And, quite remarkably, the man Rall says shot it off is Hub Zemke. After 
telling the story of being shot down -- he tumbled almost 30,000 feet before he 
could get his parachute open -- at a Gathering of Eagles a few years ago, Rall 
was approached by a World War II historian who said he had put together the 
events of that day and the man who shot him down was at the same meeting. 
That's when Zemke and Rall met for the first time. Zemke says he isn't sure 
that's right, that he remembers the encounter but thinks that it was one of his 
wingmen who brought Rall down. 
</P>
<P>
Mahurin is the only one of the "honored guests" who still flies. He has a Piper 
Cherokee at John Wayne Airport and logs "maybe 40 hours a month." The others 
have various infirmities that ground them, and Guenther Rall has another 
reason, explaining -- apparently not frivolously -- that "it is much too 
dangerous to fly in Germany any more because there are so many planes in the 
sky." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the opening turned from admiring the work of Southern California 
artists Craig Kodera, Mike Machat and Stan Stokes -- pilots all -- to listen 
slack-jawed to these stories. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is the sort of thing that perpetrates war, this sense of game, 
deadly though it is, played by honorable gladiators who never personalized the 
combat and were ready to salute a worthy adversary. ("It's going to be a sad 
day for me," said Bader, "when these men aren't around any more.") The romance 
flourished most visibly in air combat, and it is probably well that it can 
never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
Rall caught this when he said: "The days of dogfights in the air are gone 
forever. Now they just lock on each other miles away. Never again will we see 
the person we're fighting. " 
</P>
<P>
Thus ends noblesse oblige in war. There was something wonderfully clean about 
air combat. Somebody won and somebody lost; the decision was clear. Wars ended 
that way, too. Unconditional surrender. Somebody won and somebody lost. But 
like air combat, clear decisions in war are also a thing of the past. Now, 
nobody wins -- and everybody loses. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me as I was driving home that cataclysmic decisions about war 
are now being made by a man who went through precisely the same training I did 
in World War II and who once made life-or-death decisions predicated on the 
clear, clean rules of air combat. I wonder if he still reasons that way in this 
new and very different world. 
</P>
<P>
I left with a hope that whatever need we may have to engage in air combat can 
be satisfied in the future in Virginia Bader's galleries. And with -- I must 
admit -- a sense of gratitude and elation that one day I had been a small part 
of it.

WHITE ACTOR WILL PLAY LEAD ROLE IN 'ROMEO AND JULIET'; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: WITH THE DIRECTOR'S ORIGINAL PLAN TO SELECT A BLACK ROMEO HAVING BEEN 
REJECTED, CASTING FOR THAT CHARACTER IN LA HABRA COMMUNITY THEATRE'S PRODUCTION 
HAS BEEN NARROWED TO TWO MEN, BOTH WHITE.

A white actor will play Romeo in a controversial production of "Romeo and 
Juliet," after the director's original plan to cast a black actor as Romeo with 
a white Juliet was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Casting for Romeo in La Habra Community Theatre's production of the 
Shakespearean classic has been narrowed to two actors, both white, director 
Marla Gam-Hudson said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Gam-Hudson had placed an ad seeking a "black Romeo" in her intention to cast an 
interracial couple in the lead roles, but the company's board of directors 
nixed that idea in an emergency vote last week. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said that an interracial romance in the play would be too 
controversial for local audiences, and instructed Gam-Hudson to cast actors of 
the same race to portray literature's best-known star-crossed lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Gam-Hudson, who had said she would respect the board's decision, said "seven or 
eight" black actors auditioned for Romeo during two days of open auditions 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Race was not a factor in her choice of the two finalists, the director said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the black actors who auditioned "were not even close to Romeo's age. 
Most of them were late 30s," Gam-Hudson said. "Even if (the board) decision had 
never come down, they would not have been considered." 
</P>
<P>
A black actor is being considered for one of the other major roles in the play, 
Gam-Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
The director said she does not know the ethnic background of the woman she cast 
as Juliet. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 actors auditioned for the play, which will open Oct. 26 at La Habra's 
Depot Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Gam-Hudson said she had expected a bigger turnout and believes press coverage 
of the board's decision deterred some from trying out. Gam-Hudson said the low 
turnout hurt her plans for a multiracial cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I didn't have a lot to choose from, as far as that went, it is 
predominantly white," she said.

BONEDADDYS: A BAND FOR THE BODY; 
</P>
<P>
THE EIGHT-MAN DANCE GROUP TAPPED AFRICAN, CARIBBEAN AND LATIN STYLES IN SHAKING 
THE WALLS OF THE NEW PEPPERS GOLDEN BEAR CLUB.

<TEXT>
<P>
The band and the room were a good match Wednesday night as the Bonedaddys 
played the first dance-oriented show at the new Peppers Golden Bear. Both had 
the physical presence to shake things up quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based Bonedaddys are an engaging dance band that explores the 
rhythmic pathways of World Beat, a melting pot of Third World styles. Along 
with the African, Caribbean and Latin American sources associated with World 
Beat, the Bonedaddys worked in a good deal of straightforward American funk 
during their 65-minute early set. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of coming off as ethnic archivists, the unpretentious eight-man band 
kept the focus on igniting the rhythm and motivating the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonedaddys are one book that you can judge by its cover: the band works in 
garb worthy of a New Orleans Mardi Gras street party. Amid the colorful kilts, 
fezzes and robes sported by various members, guitarist Jai Vatok's furry Panda 
bear headdress was particularly loony, not to mention appropriate to the venue. 
(Already well into the merchandising game on its fifth night of operation, 
Peppers Golden Bear was selling little teddy bears at an outdoor booth, along 
with the usual T-shirts.) Special sartorial kudos also go to guitarist Paul 
Lacques, who sported a toga with a vivid color portrait of Martin Luther King 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
King's image, underlined by the "I have a dream" slogan, was as close as the 
Bonedaddys came to provoking thought during their opening set. The band's 
latest album, "Worldbeatniks," does hold a touch of social consciousness with 
an original song proclaiming the return of hippie values, and a cover of 
Nigerian activist Fela Kuti's sardonic "Zombie." But the Bonedaddys' primary 
appeal is to the body. 
</P>
<P>
The opening "Soul Makossa" was held back a bit by singer Kevin Williams' use of 
rap-show boilerplate to try to rouse the audience. (Peppers executive Ken Moon 
said 244 tickets were sold for the show; he added that Huntington Beach 
authorities have signed off on a maximum capacity of 570 for the club, up from 
early projections of about 500.) But the Bonedaddys proved capable of getting 
the dancers moving without histrionics in a set that cooked early, percolated 
along at a more easygoing pace in the middle going, then built to a fine climax 
with numbers like the Afro-chant "Dangwa" and the funky soul tune, "Shoo-Ra, 
Shoo-Ra." 
</P>
<P>
The room augmented the Bonedaddys impact: With its arsenal of high-tech audio 
and lighting gear, Peppers was unusually reflective of sound's physical 
dimension. During a few synth-organ swoops, it felt as if a jet plane were 
rumbling outside the walls. Bass notes hit with a knee-shaking impact, too. 
Peppers also has an uncommonly springy dance floor: while dancers jumped and 
shook in an area near the stage, listeners sitting on stools toward the rear of 
the dance floor were shaken by the trampoline effect. 
</P>
<P>
Further back, in the rectangular room's raised, carpeted rear section, 
sight-lines over the dancers allowed one to see the musicians from the waist 
up. The music's physical vibration carried to the back of the room, but the 
vocals did not. A bank of speakers aimed at the far seats was functioning, but 
vocals that were clear out front sounded muffled in the club's rear half. Moon 
said speaker angles and placements will be adjusted to address that problem. 
There also were some audio glitches on stage, where feedback intruded on 
several Lacques guitar solos. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed after the set, Bonedaddys percussionist Mike Tempo said that "they 
seem to be pretty together here for just opening a new club." The band also 
played at a private inaugural party at Peppers Golden Bear last Saturday. 
"We're kind of helping them break it in," Tempo said. "We hope it'll become a 
regular stop for us. We like the place, and we want to be in Orange County a 
lot more." (Perhaps Peppers also can become a regular stop for the Bonedaddys' 
Chameleon Records label-mates the Wild Cards, a fine Orange County roots-rock 
ensemble whose lively, danceable shows are far too seldom seen in the band's 
home county.) 
</P>
<P>
Several Bonedaddys fans interviewed during the evening said they liked the new 
club but still missed the old Golden Bear, which closed early in 1986. If this 
shiny, affluent heir to the name can provide options for up-and-coming acts 
that haven't had a high-profile forum in Orange County, some of that warm 
regard will probably rub off on it, too.

RANDY LEWIS: A FRUSTRATED NATION TAKES IT OUT ON THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there was an outburst of raging goofiness in the days before Pearl Harbor 
was bombed, the history books I read certainly neglected to mention it. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that increasing tensions throughout the world over the crisis in 
the Middle East may be the only explanation for the rash of absurd 
controversies over arts and entertainment that cropped up this week. 
</P>
<P>
First, the board of directors at the La Habra Community Theatre's board quashed 
a director's plan to cast a mixed-race couple in the leads for her production 
of "Romeo and Juliet," saying, among other things, that they didn't want a 
Shakespeare play saddled with a message. 
</P>
<P>
Then the honchos planning next month's inaugural festivities for the John Wayne 
Airport called an emergency meeting to deal with the ruckus over a painting of 
a winged male torso a la Icarus slated for use on the new terminal's official 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't enough nuttiness right here in Orange County, several radio 
stations around the country decided to ban records by Irish pop star Sinead 
O'Connor because she objected to the playing of the national anthem before a 
concert she gave in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
What could be behind this proliferation of teapot tempests except misplaced 
frustrations over impending major trauma? 
</P>
<P>
It's mind-boggling enough that some government officials are paying more 
attention to one small-potatoes rap group from Florida than to the financial 
crisis looming from a national debt of nearly $3 trillion. (For those of you 
who don't normally get paid in trillions, if you owed this much to your bank 
and were making payments of $10,000 a day, after one year you'd have paid back 
more than $3 million. It would be 300 years before you'd reach $1 billion and 
it would take almost a million years to pay off the full debt. And that doesn't 
include the interest, which is compounding the tab by something like $500 
million per day. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Saddam Hussein has unexpectedly made it anybody's guess whether the 
United States will be facing another Vietnam, minus the rubber trees, to what 
battlefield does the nation turn its eyes? 
</P>
<P>
The arts. 
</P>
<P>
How controversial would it have been to stage an interracial "Romeo &amp; 
Juliet" in La Habra? Somewhat less than the rounding up of hostages in Baghdad, 
I'd venture. 
</P>
<P>
But I can certainly sympathize with the objections against turning this 
medieval soap opera into a "message play," as some board members protested. A 
plague o' both your houses -- that would make worms' meat of him! 
</P>
<P>
And the airport art poster? The complaint was raised by an airport commissioner 
who had volunteered the services of his printing plant to produce it. He 
objected because the male Icarus figure (representing flight) was nude. But 
even more troubling to him was the absence of any airplanes or something more 
appropriate for commemorating the John Wayne Airport terminal. (Maybe, as a 
colleague suggested, a still from the Duke's 1951 classic "Flying Leathernecks" 
would have satisfied all concerned, since it would include Wayne, dive bombers 
and the Marines, all in one tidy image.) 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the airport arts commissioners endorsed the original artwork 
on Wednesday and are expected to formally approve it at a meeting on Saturday. 
With that out of the way, one hopes focus might return to more significant 
matters, like whether all the landing lights are plugged in by opening day. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Sinead O'Connor hubbub -- why, I haven't heard of such an outrage 
since Roseanne Barr muffed "The Star-Spangled Banner" in San Diego. As long as 
we've got some momentum for a constitutional amendment barring any damage, 
physical or otherwise, to the American flag, we probably ought to come up with 
a rider protecting the national anthem from defamation, denigration or off-key 
renditions. 
</P>
<P>
Better still, with so much tension everywhere we turn, we need to get our mind 
off these weighty problems with a nice diversion, such as a good play, a 
concert or a movie. It doesn't matter which, as long as it's one with 
airplanes. And no Sinead O'Connor.

<P>
There's a line in Woody Allen's "God," a paraphrase of an old Hollywood maxim, 
that goes like this: "Theater is for entertainment. If you want to deliver a 
message, call Western Union." 
</P>
<P>
That's Woody being glib, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, after all, has throughout most of his career been the main man of the 
big-brain set, a comic who does deliver messages, along with the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
But that crack makes sense for "God," one of his earlier efforts apparently 
designed solely for yuks. Or, when it sinks in the corn, yucks. 
</P>
<P>
This frantic one-act isn't great Woody, but hey, even God got to rest on the 
seventh day. 
</P>
<P>
It has some moments, though, which the Orange Coast College Repertory Theatre 
Company tries to take advantage of in its outdoor on-campus production. 
</P>
<P>
The nervy, enthusiastic actors know they're hamming it up -- it's even 
acknowledged in the program, where everybody thanks "The William Shatner School 
of Acting" -- and the fun they have can be catching every now and then. 
</P>
<P>
All the horseplay is pretty self-indulgent, but since the comedy lasts only 
about 45 minutes and the sunny alfresco setting can be so pleasant, it's 
reasonably bearable. 
</P>
<P>
Director Eric Person keeps everything moving along, which helps, even when the 
cast almost speed-reads over the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the plot, centering on a chaotic play within a play that features 
ancient Greeks with names like Trichinosis and Hepatitis as well as appearances 
by Stanley Kowalski and Blanche DuBois, welcomes a speedy, elbow-in-the-ribs 
treatment. 
</P>

FIRST SAVE TOUGH ONE FOR DODGER WALSH, 3-2;

<P>
BASEBALL: HE RETIRES KRUK WITH TWO OUT IN THE NINTH INNING. BROOKS CONTINUES 
TORRID AUGUST WITH GO-AHEAD DOUBLE.

<P>
The Dodgers presented rookie Dave Walsh with his first career save opportunity 
Thursday, although he is forgiven for not immediately thanking them. 
</P>
<P>
There were two out in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. The tying run was on second base. Jim Gott was pitching. And Walsh 
was not believing his ears. 
</P>
<P>
"When Perry (pitching coach Ron Perranoski) went to the mound, I thought he was 
just going to talk . . . then all of a sudden he is calling for me," recalled 
Walsh. "I was, uh surprised." 
</P>
<P>
He was more surprised when his first three pitches to John Kruk were balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Nice job,' " Walsh said. "I thought, 'Man, this is the only batter 
you've got to get. This is, like, do or die.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walsh threw a strike and then pitched Kruk inside, forcing a weak pop fly to 
right field to end the game and give the Dodgers a 3-2 victory before 24,160 at 
Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can see," a relieved Walsh said later, "this team is on a 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to only their second three-game sweep on the road this season, they 
remained 5 1/2 games behind the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds, 
who defeated Chicago, 6-5. They have won 12 of their last 16 games and are 
31-17 since the All-Star break, the best record in major league baseball during 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
Their only problem is, the Reds are getting hot again. And despite seven 
victories in their last nine games, the Dodgers have gained no ground during 
that time. They have 32 games remaining and the Reds have 33, with six meetings 
remaining between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But no matter when it is, the game is still not going to change for you. . . . 
Two weeks from now you are still going to have to get three outs and then go 
out on the field and hold them," said Eddie Murray, reflecting an attitude that 
has been adopted by this calm, veteran team. "I'm not going to sit here and let 
anything put pressure on us. Every game is still just a game." 
</P>
<P>
Murray's poise led to a run-scoring single against Darrel Akerfelds in the 
fifth inning that gave the Dodgers a 2-2 tie. Then he drew a walk against Joe 
Boever in the eighth to set up the series' offensive hero, Hubie Brooks, who 
drove a two-strike pitch into the left-center field gap for a go-ahead double. 
</P>
<P>
Despite entering the series with a sore left knee he aggravated again in the 
third inning Thursday, Brooks had eight hits in 13 at-bats with a homer, three 
doubles and five RBIs for the three games. Living up to his reputation as one 
of the clutch players in baseball, Brooks is batting .359 in August with five 
homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie Brooks is the kind of guy who can carry a club," Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. "When he gets hot, he stays hot." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks heard the quote, chuckled and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't carry a club, man," he said, pausing. "But I can sure help." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't know how to explain it. Sometimes I come in and swing good, 
sometimes I don't. But we're not that far out of first place, so every day I'm 
going to come in here ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's tough. Sometimes it's a real struggle. But I'm going to be out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Few imagined that Walsh, who had made seven appearances with no decisions since 
being recalled from triple-A Albuquerque Aug. 11, would be out there at the 
end. He had a 6.35 earned-run average in 5 2/3 innings and had allowed six 
unearned runs in one-third of an inning against the Phillies last week. 
</P>
<P>
But with injuries to Ray Searage and Pat Perry, Walsh is the club's only 
left-hander relief pitcher. After Gott allowed a one-out single to Von Hayes in 
the ninth inning and Dale Murphy advanced Hayes to second base with a grounder, 
bringing up left-handed hitting Kruk, Lasorda felt he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they didn't have Carmelo Martinez (a right-handed hitter traded to 
Pittsburgh earlier in the day), so I knew Kruk would have to bat, so I wanted a 
left-handed who could throw him the breaking balls," Lasorda said. "This is 
like the Marine Corps -- I want to get a guy out there and find out what he can 
do in the heat of the battle. How else will I ever know?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Walsh: "The other day I was thinking, just two years ago I was washing my 
own uniform in Mexico (Mexican League) . . . and now look at this. It's pretty 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
He saved the game for Ramon Martinez, who earned his 16th victory but his first 
in five starts, despite allowing 10 hits in seven innings with just two 
strikeouts. Martinez, who still leads the National League with 190 strikeouts, 
has averaged just four strikeouts per game in his last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have recalled four minor leaguers -- two pitchers and two position 
players -- who will join the team when the rosters are expanded Saturday. 
Infielder Jose Vizcaino, catcher Darrin Fletcher and right-handed pitcher 
Darren Holmes were recalled from triple-A Albuquerque, and left-handed pitcher 
Jim Poole was recalled from double-A San Antonio. The four will mainly serve as 
role players. . . . Vizcaino and Poole played for the Dodgers earlier this 
year, when Vizcaino batted .200 in 10 at-bats and Poole was 0-0 with a 5.40 
earned-run average in seven appearances. Poole was scored upon in just one of 
his seven games. Fletcher, a left-handed hitter, played five games for the 
Dodgers last season, collecting four hits in eight at-bats with a home run. 
Holmes, a 16th-round selection in the 1984 draft, will be making his major 
league debut. In 54 relief appearances in Albuquerque, he was 12-2 with a 3.22 
ERA with 95 strikeouts in 89 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Vizcaino batted .279 for Albuquerque and Fletcher batted .291 with a 
team-leading 13 homers and 65 RBIs for the Dukes. Poole was 5-7 with a 2.47 ERA 
for San Antonio with 75 strikeouts and 24 walks in 62 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels and Kirk Gibson both wanted to be in the lineup, but both were 
ordered to rest because of nagging injuries. Daniels is still nursing a pulled 
muscle in his back, and Gibson's left knee is as sore as expected after playing 
hard for two games on artificial turf. Both are expected to return to the 
lineup in Montreal today. . . . Ray Searage said he felt good while throwing 50 
pitches on the side in his first action since going on the disabled list with 
an inflamed left elbow Aug. 18. He hopes to throw again today, and if he 
continues to progress, he could be ready within a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers newest power hitting prospect, double-A outfielder Henry Rodriguez, 
was named Player of the Year in the Texas League. He led all double-A players 
with 28 homers and 108 RBIs for San Antonio.

RAIDER TOP DRAFT PICK SMITH IS SIDELINED BY KNEE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Defensive end Anthony Smith, the Raiders' first-round draft choice, might be 
lost for the season after injuring his knee, Coach Art Shell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith tore the medial collateral ligament and sustained a cartilage tear in his 
right knee during practice Wednesday and is scheduled to undergo surgery today 
at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
While the extent of the damage won't be known until the operation has been 
completed, the Raiders fear Smith will be sidelined for a minimum of three 
months, which means that he might be able to return in December or early 
January for the playoffs. The Raiders haven't reached the playoffs since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The injury occurred while Smith was engaged with a blocker. A teammate fell 
behind him, and he was pushed back over the top of the player on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak thing," Shell said. "It was devastating. You look at it on film 
and it's a fluke. Somebody lost their balance and hit him on the side of the 
leg. It seems so unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the nature of this game. Sometimes you go real hard and things 
don't happen, and you go easy and things still happen. It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he doesn't remember how he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what happened," Smith said from the hospital. "I haven't 
seen it on film. I want to see it on film to see what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Does Smith think he'll be able to play this season? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I haven't even talked to the doctor about that yet. 
I'm injured now and all I can do is rest and get better. Time will only tell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really devastated. The best thing about life is that there's always 
another day, and the best thing about football is that there's always another 
Saturday. Guys have been injured and they've been out on the field again. 
Devastation comes when you're not able to do what you love to do. I'm able to 
come back, so I'm not devastated." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates lamented the injury to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always bad to lose a No. 1 pick that has as much potential as he does," 
linebacker Greg Townsend said. "I think he would have been an impact player. 
</P>
<P>
Nose guard Bob Golic sympathized with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through the same thing he's going through now as a young guy coming 
into the league," Golic said. "I ended up in injured reserve my first year. I 
remember it was kind of a rough time because even though your friends are there 
and they're talking you through it, it's still a difficult thing to deal with. 
"It's a big blow because the defensive line was coming together. Having a young 
guy with that enthusiasm, talent and speed is something that we'll miss." 
</P>
<P>
The 11th player selected in the 1990 NFL draft, the 6-foot-3, 260-pound Smith 
played three seasons at Alabama before transfering to Arizona, where he earned 
All-Pacific 10 honors last season. Smith made 71 tackles with five sacks and 
six pass deflections in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As a backup to Scott Davis at left defensive end, Smith had one sack during the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensive line is a position where we have a number of good players, and, 
unfortunately, we just have one less good player," said position coach Bill 
Urbanik. "I'm sure we'll do fine this year even though we don't have Anthony 
Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Art Shell said the Raiders will probably bring back defensive tackle 
David Caldwell, cut earlier this week, to replace Anthony Smith. If Smith is 
placed on the injured reserve list before Monday's cut to 47, he won't be able 
to play this season. . . . Quarterback Steve Beuerlein said the Raiders have 
lowered their offer to him, a negotiating tactic the club used to force 
fullback Steve Smith to end his holdout. The Raiders' initial offer to 
Beuerlein, who earned $140,000 last season, was a three-year deal reportedly 
worth an average of $500,000 a season.

LUKAS HAS IT ALL -- EXCEPT FOR SLEEPING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LITKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's already got the jet, the Rolls, the Rolex and the Armani suits. More 
trophies, more titles and more money than the Trumps, even reunited. So how 
come D. Wayne Lukas still sleeps only five hours a night? 
</P>
<P>
Critics, and there are still plenty, say he needs the rest of the time to keep 
the wheels of his juggernaut turning. Lukas says otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I don't wake up every morning, look around and say, 'What's left?' 
Because other people have to find things to replenish themselves," he said. "It 
happens to me every day." 
</P>
<P>
Waking and winning or waking and preparing to win; it seems sometimes that he 
would have a problem drawing the line between the points on the map or the days 
on a calender. 
</P>
<P>
This particular Thursday began with a 4 a.m. arrival at California's Del Mar 
race track, where Lukas surveyed his well-manicured grounds and a 
better-manicured stable of horses. It will end sometime around 10:30 p.m. in 
Oklahoma, where he will look at a host of pricey yearlings with any eye toward 
deciding which horse gets plugged into which division of the Team Lukas 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the road show shifts to Chicago. There, he will personally administer 
the finishing touches on Steinlen, the defending champion and current favorite 
to win the Arlington Million on Sunday, which, coincidentally, is Lukas' 55th 
birthday. The gift, it seems, is already wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
By now, anyone with a passing interest in thoroughbred racing could draw the 
broad outlines of Lukas' career, or be asked to draw a flow chart for the sport 
and turn back a reasonably accurate one by always pencilling in Lukas' name at 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
If he is not the most beloved trainer in the world, he is, without argument, 
the winningest by every measure. In fact, it is precisely because of his 
success that people who follow the racket know what a flow chart is. But when 
he arrived on the thoroughbred scene 11 years ago, Lukas inspired little more 
than ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
A former basketball coach, he brought organization and an obsessive-compulsive 
personality into a world of gypsy crones and world-renowned savants. Lukas 
didn't arrive at a track so much as beautify it; he had assistants rake the 
gravel and attach planters outside his barn. He favored expensive cowboy boots 
and flashed even more-expensive jewelry, whereas the already-monied deans of 
the profession still walked around in the zippered models, hands stuck deep in 
their pockets so as not to encourage any more thievery than was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else was waiting for luck or money or magic to deliver just one good 
piece of horseflesh stretched over the right configuration; Lukas was 
collecting as much as he could beg, borrow or steal. Everyone else wanted one 
horse who could win everywhere; Lukas wanted a hundred, some of whom were bound 
to win somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else was building a career; D. Wayne Lukas, even then, was building an 
empire. What made it so hard to swallow is that he turned out to be so right so 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas won the Preakness after just two years and his first Eclipse Award as the 
nation's leading trainer four years after that. And even if the speed with 
which he achieved success was just impressive, the size of his successes were 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Lukas broke Charlie Whittingham's earnings record, then nearly doubled 
it the following year and has bettered his own record every year since. In 
1985, he won a record 70 stakes. In 1986, he became the first trainer ever to 
collect more in purse earnings than the nation's leading jockey. In 1987, he 
saddled a staggering 1,700 horses and won 92 stakes and some of his colleagues 
continued to whisper behind his back that he would win twice as many races "if 
he were any good." 
</P>
<P>
That determination, Lukas said, depends on your definition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who's still criticizing our program is looking pretty silly by now," 
Lukas said matter-of-factly. "The bottom line is to win, make money and develop 
champions. Those are the things that are supposed to be done in this game and 
we've accomplished all those. 
</P>
<P>
"What some of the old-timers took 50 or 60 years to accomplish, we've done in 
10. And so the criticism," he added, "is less and less. ... You can hammer 
somebody only so long." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Handicappers likely would bet his name more if they didn't see it so 
often, and so often on different horse's lines in the same race. As of two 
weeks ago, Lukas had saddled 827 horses this year and won in the neighborhood 
of $10 million. His closest pursuers had 578 and $3.6 million, respectively, 
and the disparity only promises to grow. 
</P>
<P>
He has been hammering the competition so mercilessly for so long now that most 
of the rest of the racing world wishes he would take up golf, take a few days 
vacation, stay out late going to a movie, sleep in once in a while, just kind 
of ... chill out. 
</P>
<P>
It won't happen anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is a vacation for me. If I lose, it's still a good day, just not as 
much fun. ... I like the finer things in life, but I don't need them to keep 
score," Lukas concluded, "and I don't feel like I have to apologize for any of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think God looked down one day and said, 'Give this Wisconsin boy all 
the runners in the world.' I earned them."

WALLY'S WORLD HAS BECOME UNSETTLED; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: JOYNER'S KNEE IS HEALING, AND HE HOPES TO PLAY AGAIN BEFORE THE 
SEASON ENDS. BUT ARE THE ANGELS IN HIS FUTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He will play again, probably within three or four weeks. Of that much Wally 
Joyner is certain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a setback, but with time it will heal itself and there will be no 
residual side effects," Joyner said of the broken kneecap that has idled him 
since July 11. 
</P>
<P>
A few minor details must be settled before he picks up his first baseman's 
glove again. One is ensuring that the tedious healing process is complete. Only 
last week was Joyner permitted to begin riding an exercise bicycle and to do 
isometric exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee. And, although 
trainer Ned Bergert said there's no reason he can't return this season, Joyner 
said the knee still won't allow him to do strenuous work. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any regressions, and that's helped me continue to keep my 
sanity, because over the past six, seven weeks I've lost my sanity a couple of 
times," he said. "One of the reasons why is my optimistic outlook. If somebody 
says, 'Four to six weeks and you'll be OK,' I say, 'I'm going to be ready in 
four.' The way I look at it now, the worst possible thing is that I can't play 
any more this season. I look at it that way so if I come back with a week or 
two left, that's a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
When he does play again, there's another detail to be decided: What uniform he 
will be wearing. It's becoming increasingly likely that if Joyner does play for 
the Angels again, it would be only briefly and only to showcase him for a trade 
the club has been trying to make. 
</P>
<P>
The maturing of first baseman Lee Stevens during Joyner's absence makes Joyner 
logical trade bait. His numbers and age (28) are good enough to bring a rich 
return, perhaps in a deal to fill the Angels' need for a power-hitting third 
baseman or an everyday second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in getting worried until something happens," Joyner said of 
the notion that he has played his last game as an Angel. "It's not up to me. It 
could hurt me in the long run if I said I enjoy playing here, and it could hurt 
me if I said I didn't. It's up to the Angels to make that decision and to make 
the moves. I've done it too many times and been disappointed too many times 
making the first move." 
</P>
<P>
This has been a year of disappointments for Joyner, who traces his injury to 
being hit in the right shin by a pitch from Milwaukee's Chris Bosio on May 15 
and damaging the knee by not walking properly on that leg. Joyner continued to 
play on the injured knee until a stress fracture was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the injury, I was doing well. It might have been my best season. It 
could have been easily," said Joyner, who peaked at .318 on May 24 and was 
hitting .268 with 41 runs batted in -- second on the club to Lance Parrish's 44 
-- when he was placed on the disabled list on July 16. "But we'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's disappointment began last winter with a salary dispute, another in a 
series of showdowns with the club. After his standout 1987 season, when he hit 
.285 with 34 home runs and 117 RBIs, the Angels renewed his contract for 1988 
at $340,000 after acrimonious talks. He settled shortly before an arbitration 
hearing in 1989. And he went to arbitration last February to get the $1,750,000 
he sought instead of the Angels' offer of $1,225,000. He will be eligible for 
free agency after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been bitter, just disappointed," Joyner said. "Arbitration doesn't 
bother me at all. The negotiations don't bother me. It's the negotiations 
before getting to arbitration that get me. It's frustration and more 
frustration. But this is not the right time and it's not my place to talk about 
that now. It's kind of hard for somebody on the disabled list to talk about 
what his future with the team is." 
</P>
<P>
He expects the future to hold many changes for the Angels, and one of those 
changes could be the permanent installation at first base of Stevens, who has 
done a creditable job in Joyner's absence. A solid defensive player who is 
streaky at the plate but has power, Stevens is hitting .239 with 20 RBIs in 41 
games. Stevens has had exactly half as many at-bats as Joyner did in 83 games, 
310-155, so comparing their statistics is not unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens has hit five homers and scored 20 runs, which compares favorably to 
Joyner's eight homers and 35 runs scored, but Joyner has more than twice 
Stevens' totals of hits (83-37) and doubles (15-5). Joyner also strikes out 
less, 34 times to 45 by Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he has replaced me and he plays first, but I think he's done me a 
favor by playing well because there's been less pressure on me to hurry back," 
Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my injury is not career-ending, career-threatening. Wherever I'm 
playing next year, I'll play like Wally Joyner. Hopefully, it will be for the 
Angels. If not, I'll make the adjustments." 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, ON THE BLOCK?: Wally Joyner (above) expects to be playing again before 
the season ends, but it could be so the Angels can showcase his talents. The 
emergence of Lee Stevens at first base might make Joyner expendable.

PIRATES GET MARTINEZ FROM PHILLIES FOR TWO MINOR LEAGUERS IN MIXUP

<P>
The Philadelphia Phillies sent outfielder-first baseman Carmelo Martinez to 
Pittsburgh on Thursday for two minor league outfielders who had been mistakenly 
placed on irrevocable waivers by the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies get Wes Chamberlain, 23, who was batting .250 at triple-A Buffalo, 
and Julio Peguero, 21, who was hitting .282 for double-A Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Doughty, the Pirates' general manager, said he was forced to place the 
two minor league players on waivers when he juggled his 40-man roster, but he 
thought he was placing them on procedural waivers that could be revoked if they 
were claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake. I misinterpreted the rules," he said. "We had to trade them 
or lose them, because we were going to lose them anyway. The waiver claims 
forced me to do something a little bigger than I planned to do, but I like the 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies claimed the minor leaguers, triggering the deal, and also will get 
a player to be named.

STRAWBERRY SLAMS GIANTS, 12-2; METS WITHIN 1 1/2 
</P>

<P>
Sid Fernandez struck out a season-high 12 and Darryl Strawberry put the game 
away with a grand slam in the eighth inning Thursday, leading the New York Mets 
past the San Francisco Giants at New York, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson hit a three-run homer and Gregg Jefferies added a two-run shot 
as the Mets trimmed the idle Pittsburgh Pirates' lead in the East to 1 1/2 
games. The victory also improved the Mets' record at Shea Stadium to, 43-22, 
best home mark in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play well enough at home to get back on top," Strawberry said who 
hit his fourth career grand slam and the fifth grand slam by the Mets this 
season. Strawberry, who drove in five runs, has 29 homers and 85 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Giants 8 1/2 games behind Cincinnati in the West, but 
Manager Roger Craig said his team isn't ready to be counted out. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out and we have to put a streak together," he said. "We're 
still in the pennant race." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez (9-10) struck out every Giants starter except Will Clark and fanned 
Greg Litton and Matt Williams three times each. The left-hander's previous high 
in strikeouts this season was 10. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6, Chicago 5 -- The Reds' title hopes got a boost when Danny 
Jackson, who was sidelined because of a partially torn rotator cuff, returned 
from the disabled list and pitched the Reds over the Cubs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson (5-2) gave up four runs and eight hits over five innings in his first 
start since July 12. The left-hander also tripled home a run. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble pitched 2 2/3 innings and Randy Myers got the last three outs for 
his 27th save in 31 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Atlanta 3 -- Pinch-hitter Terry Pendleton snapped a 12th-inning 
tie with a sacrifice fly and Dave Collins added a run-scoring single to give 
the Cardinals a victory over the Braves at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of only 3,672 showed up for the first appearance of Joe Torre, former 
Braves' manager, at Atlanta Stadium since he was fired following the 1984 
season. Torre was hired Aug. 1 as manager of the Cardinals, replacing Whitey 
Herzog, who resigned.

IN DARKNESS, HIS COMPETITIVE LIGHT SHINES; 
</P>
<P>
JUDO: LYNN MANNING LOST HIS SIGHT TO A BULLET, BUT NOT HIS DESIRE TO WIN AT 
LIFE. NOW HE HAS EARNED A GOLD MEDAL IN THE WORLD GAMES FOR THE DISABLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS EICHELBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Twelve years ago, Lynn Manning was fighting for his life. A gunshot to the head 
nearly killed him and left him blind. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he gained international recognition by winning a gold medal in judo 
at the World Games for the Disabled in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the events that accompanied his troubled childhood might have been 
most responsible for leading him beyond the limits of his disability and into 
that judo final. 
</P>
<P>
Although Manning defeated a Soviet competitor for the gold, he had considered 
quitting competitive judo, after a disappointing fourth-place finish in the 
1988 Paralympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynn made some mistakes in Korea (at the Paralympics), but he learned from 
them and has begun to play smarter," said Manning's coach, Neil Ohlenkamp. 
"Just like he fought through his life, he's fought his way to the top in judo. 
. . . The guy simply never gives up." 
</P>
<P>
Ohlenkamp was confident that Manning would bounce back after the Paralympics, 
but his judoist wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a severe disappointment to me, and I felt that it was a disappointment 
to the people who supported my going as well," Manning said. "I was thinking 
about that when I went to the Netherlands for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate fear was that I wasn't going to be able to bring back the gold 
this year, either. All I could see was coming back empty-handed again. I 
couldn't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Manning's victory in July might have brought him some recognition, but his 
athletic achievements are only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, 35, grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in a single-parent household 
of nine children. He says there were men around the home but none stayed long. 
</P>
<P>
When Manning was 9, the family was split up and he was sent to the first of 
five foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was (a 29-year-old) alcoholic with nine kids between 18 months and 
10 years, and it was a bit too much for her," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lack of parental support, however, Manning excelled in school, making 
the honor society in junior high and finishing high school with a B average. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he enrolled at Los Angeles City College, studying 
architecture at first, then changing to art. But the home problems continued. 
</P>
<P>
"(My mother) had been in and out of institutions," Manning said. "And since 
then, she's been to prison a couple of times. . . . Her story's pretty rocky, 
but I'm still in touch with her." 
</P>
<P>
Manning had taken a few classes at L.A. City when he began working as a 
juvenile counselor at the McCobb home for boys. About the same time, his art 
career began to blossom and he had sold a few drawings on commission. Then his 
life took a nasty turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just worked four days at the boys' home and had the next two days off 
and I went to a bar on Vine Street to have a few beers," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy wanted to pick a fight with me, and since the bartender didn't do 
anything about it, I threw him out myself. A half hour later, he came back with 
a gun and shot me behind the left eye and the bullet lodged in the other side 
of my head." 
</P>
<P>
His sight was gone and his art career apparently was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'OK, what am I going to do now?' " he said. "My background was pretty 
rocky anyway. I was used to losing things, having them snatched away at the 
last moment. So that didn't come as a major shock. I just had to get used to 
losing my sight." 
</P>
<P>
Manning had always enjoyed literature and decided to try writing poetry. 
</P>
<P>
He has had several poems published and hopes to sell a book of poetry and an 
autobiography that he has been working on for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the things I've overcome, but I can't imagine myself not doing 
it," Manning said. "I can't imagine myself doing anything else. You have to 
give it all, at anything you ever wanted to accomplish. If I didn't do it, then 
it wouldn't be done. It's something I don't think twice about." 
</P>
<P>
Manning has been married for three years and lists his marriage as one of his 
proudest accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make a positive contribution to my world," he said. "I hope to be a 
positive influence in the lives of anyone I come in contact with, whether 
through the written word or through sharing a couple of beers across a bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you have anything as an individual to contribute on a one-to-one 
level, then you affect the globe as a whole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To say you can't effect change is to say you can't affect one person in your 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
And Manning seems to have done that.

The Old Warson Country Club in St. Louis, Mo., withdrew from consideration for 
a Senior PGA Tour event because it refused to set a timetable for recruiting 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course, which has no black or Jewish members, was scheduled to be the 
site of the Southwestern Bell tournament in 1991. But the PGA Tour requires 
that courses take active steps towards integrating memberships. 
</P>
<P>
Old Warson President Greg Nooney Jr. said the club's board decided that they 
would not accelerate minority membership applicants ahead of a "big backlog" of 
other applicants.

BUBKA'S WIN STREAK ENDS IN EUROPEAN MEET;

TRACK AND FIELD: SOVIET POLE VAULTER LOSES IN MAJOR COMPETITION FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN SEVEN YEARS.

<P>
The streak is over for Sergei Bubka. 
</P>
<P>
After going seven years without losing in a major competition, the Soviet pole 
vaulter finished sixth Thursday at the European Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka, the world record-holder at 19 feet 10 1/2 and 1988 Olympic, world and 
European champion, made only two of nine vaults as teammate Rodion Gataulin won 
the event at 19-2 1/4. Soviet Grigory Yegorov was second. Austria's Hermann 
Fehringer third. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka cleared only 18-8 1/4. He blamed the loss on a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to get used to losses after a string of bad results this year," Bubka 
said. "Now I'm finally learning that the losses are a part of sports." 
</P>
<P>
"I had problems with injuries which hampered my usual training schedule, but I 
will be back. I won't give up that easily." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Elliott of Britain, the favorite for the men's 1,500 meters, fell during 
his semifinal in a crowded pack about 600 meters from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Team spokesman Tony Ward protested that Elliott was pushed. After the tape was 
viewed, officials ruled that Elliott's fall was caused by East Germany's Hauke 
Fuhlbruegge. Elliott made it to the final, while Fuhlbruegge was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
East German Katrin Krabbe won the women's 200 meters to become the first double 
gold medal winner at the championships, and Britain won two more men's golds. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of competition, East Germany led with eight gold medals. 
Britain was second with seven golds. 
</P>
<P>
Krabbe won the 200 meters in 21.95 seconds two days after winning the 100 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if I'll pick up three golds here, if things work out as they 
should," she said, referring to the upcoming sprint relay. "My win in the 200 
was tougher than the 100, but I was confident in both races." 
</P>
<P>
Heike Drechsler of East Germany, a gold medalist in the long jump, was second 
and Galina Malchugina of the Soviet Union third. 
</P>
<P>
In another upset, Paivi Alafranti of Finland won the women's javelin with throw 
of 222 feet, beating a strong East German team led by world record-holder Petra 
Felke. Karen Forkel was second and Felke third. 
</P>
<P>
John Regis won the men's 200 meters in 20.11 seconds and Roger Black the 400 in 
45.08 for the two British men's golds.

OIL PRICES HEAT UP AS HOPES FOR QUICK MIDEAST SETTLEMENT FADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As hopes dimmed for a quick and peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis, 
crude oil prices spurted higher Thursday, following some sharp declines earlier 
in the week. Wholesale gasoline and heating oil prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
The price of light crude oil for October delivery rose 85 cents to close at 
$26.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the benchmark grade of oil traded as high as $32.25 a barrel last 
week, tying a 1983 record. But the price slipped $4 on Monday and nearly $2 on 
Wednesday on news reports that hostages would be freed and that Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein was negotiating a secret agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, when no hostages were let go on Thursday and Hussein denied any 
softening of his stance, prices bounced back up, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the market was trading yesterday, you would think that peace had been 
declared, and we all know that it hasn't," said Thomas Bentz, director of 
trading for United Energy Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that people are starting to understand that Hussein is going to be 
there for a while," said Thomas Lewis, energy analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps, a 
Chicago-based investment firm. "The United States is not going to run in there 
and smash him to bits." 
</P>
<P>
Technical factors also played a part in Thursday's price increase, said Walter 
Zimmerman, a trader with Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York. A price of about 
$25.30 a barrel has become a support level in recent days at which traders are 
not willing to "sell short" or bet that the price will drop even more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got down to where there were no sellers," Zimmerman said. "You say, 'The 
market's looking for volunteers. Anybody want to sell short down here?' Nobody 
volunteers, so we go higher." 
</P>
<P>
Traders also were unwilling to sell short heading into the uncertainty of a 
long Labor Day weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a Middle East stalemate becomes likely, the market is becoming less 
volatile, said Kevin Kelly, manager of futures trading for Chevron Corp.'s 
international oil company in San Francisco. Kelly predicted a trading range 
between $25 and $30 a barrel, "so there is more upside within that range," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And even though President Bush said Thursday that he expects no "major 
imbalances" in the oil markets because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, several 
oil experts said there will still be a shortfall despite the agreement by this 
week by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to temporarily boost 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price for unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 4.35 
cents to close at 89.07 cents a gallon. The price for September contracts for 
home heating oil increased 3.9 cents to close at 75.54 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
In related energy developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
* Florida's attorney general accused Phillips Petroleum of charging independent 
gas distributors more for gasoline than company-operated service stations. "The 
evidence gathered thus far suggests that independent jobbers and distributors 
could buy Phillips gas cheaper at a company-operated service station than by 
buying wholesale directly from the company," Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed in a state court, he asked for an injunction against the 
pricing practice and a $5,000 fine. A Phillips spokesman said the company was 
unaware of the allegations and hadn't yet seen the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
* Texas energy regulators voted in an emergency session to allow maximum output 
from most of the state's oil wells starting Saturday, in a move that will boost 
output by between 20,000 and 30,000 barrels per day to help ease shortfalls 
caused by the Mideast crisis.

SIMMONS SEEKS TO DOUBLE HIS LOCKHEED STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas investor Harold C. Simmons, who made an unsuccessful bid for control of 
Lockheed Corp. last spring, has offered to buy an additional 10 million shares 
in the Calabasas-based company, which would nearly double his 19.8% stake. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, in an interview Thursday, said he still wants to control Lockheed and 
called on the company to eliminate its "poison pill" defense. The anti-takeover 
provision is triggered when an unwelcome suitor reaches 20% ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' offer was contained in an Aug. 29 letter from NL Industries, a 
Houston-based company he controls, to Lockheed Chairman Dan Tellep. Simmons 
offered $35 a share -- a total of $350 million -- for 10 million shares held in 
Lockheed's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed stock closed at $26.375 Thursday, down 37 1/2 cents on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed had no immediate response to the offer, which would give Simmons -- 
through NL Industries -- 35.6% of Lockheed's stock. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries' stake, the second largest after the ESOP's, was fattened 
recently to 19.8%. In a filing with the SEC, the firm said it bought 510,700 
Lockheed shares between Aug. 15 and Aug. 29 at prices ranging from $26.25 to 
$28.75. 
</P>
<P>
If NL hits 20%, the poison pill would entitle Lockheed to sell stock to other 
current shareholders at a discount, diluting the hostile buyer's stake. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, NL Industries President J. Landis Martin asked the aerospace 
concern to amend the poison pill provision to allow NL to purchase the shares 
from the ESOP. The ESOP, which holds slightly more than a 20% stake, is exempt 
from the provision. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said the poison pill discourages potential bidders and prevents 
Lockheed shareholders from cashing in on the kind of stock price rises that 
occur during takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind acquiring controlling interest if I could do it at a fair 
price," Simmons said. "I want to ensure value for Lockheed shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ESOP's exemption from the poison pill provision, Simmons 
accused Lockheed management of attempting to use the employee stock plan to 
obtain controlling interest of Lockheed stock. The ESOP is affiliated with a 
company savings plan that allows employees to buy company stock. Lockheed 
matches 60% of each employee's contribution to the plan, making the donation in 
the form of stock. At the current pace of stock contribution, the ESOP will 
have a 30% stake in Lockheed in about two years, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that ESOP members can vote on company issues, Simmons also reiterated a 
charge he made earlier this year, that Lockheed executives established the ESOP 
to entrench themselves. The NL Industries letter to Lockheed "highlights the 
fact that they set up the ESOP to keep votes in management's pocket," Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Scott Hallman denied the charge. He cited a Lockheed 
statement released when the ESOP was announced in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The ESOP is intended to stimulate employee involvement to make the company 
more productive and competitive by giving employees an added stake in the 
financial success of the corporation," Hallman said. 
</P>
<P>
ESOP votes are central to a legal dispute between Simmons and Lockheed. Simmons 
headed a slate of candidates that opposed Lockheed's directors in an expensive 
campaign for Lockheed board seats last March. Lockheed last April announced 
that the incumbent directors were reelected by shareholders at the company's 
March 29 annual meeting with 57.6% to 60.7% of the voted shares. 
</P>
<P>
The flap over the ESOP vote began hours after the board election. At that time, 
a spokesman for the ESOP trustee said the trustee did not receive instructions 
on how to vote a block of shares believed to number at least 500,000 of the 
roughly 12 million shares owned by the plan. The trustee voted the 500,000 
shares for management. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons contends that the 500,000 shares should not have been voted for either 
side. Simmons filed suit April 18 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in an 
attempt to void the election. The suit also challenges the ESOP because plan 
members have not yet paid for most of their stock. Lockheed management helped 
establish the ESOP, guaranteeing the loan the plan used to purchase company 
stock. Members gradually acquire the stock from the plan. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 22 Simmons amended his suit, contending that Lockheed's directors 
violated their legal obligations to shareholders by creating the ESOP.

UPS Awarded Cargo Route to Japan: The U.S. Transportation Department selected 
United Parcel Service Co. to operate a new all-cargo route to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Emery Worldwide Airlines was awarded backup authority. The new route was 
authorized in an agreement last year between Japan and the United States 
calling for a substantial expansion of air service between the two countries. 
UPS spokesman Ken Sternad said the company, which plans to operate six flights 
a week, had not yet placed a value on the route.

JUDGE MAY TOSS OUT PAYOLA CASE AGAINST ISGRO; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT THE PROSECUTION WITHHELD KEY DOCUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles said Thursday that he will decide over the Labor 
Day weekend whether to dismiss the biggest payola trial in 30 years and bring 
an end to the government's case against former record promoter Joseph Isgro and 
two other defendants due to claims that prosecutors improperly withheld key 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
"What is clear is that there has been a violation," said U.S. District Judge 
James M. Ideman. "Material that should have been turned over long ago was not 
turned over. . . . I have not decided what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ideman could end the trial if he decides to dismiss the case "with prejudice," 
meaning that the charges could not be refiled. 
</P>
<P>
Ideman suspended the trial until Tuesday after being informed that six volumes 
of testimony given in an earlier trial by a key government witness, Dennis Di 
Ricco, had not been given to either the defense or the grand jury that indicted 
Isgro, former CBS Records executive Ray Anderson and Isgro associate Jeffrey 
Monka. Court rules require the prosecution to make available to a defendant any 
information that might aid in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Di Ricco, an accountant and business associate of Isgro, was 
given in his own trial in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. He was 
convicted in that case on tax and obstruction of justice charges. But lawyers 
for Isgro and his co-defendants claim that in 74 instances, Di Ricco gave 
testimony in the San Francisco case that contradicts statements he later made 
before the Los Angeles grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly every key allegation made . . . (is) contradicted by his sworn 
testimony in San Francisco," said Isgro's attorney, Donald M. Re, outside the 
courtroom Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecutors in the case, William S. Lynch and Drew Pitt, left court 
without comment and did not return a later call seeking comment about the 
trial's turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning development in the five-year-long payola, mail fraud and 
racketeering case came in the second week of the high-stakes trial, which has 
been widely followed by the radio and recording industries. The case has also 
received unusually close supervision from the Justice Department, which 
dispatched Lynch, its senior litigation counsel, to Los Angeles from Washington 
to lead the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Isgro, one of the most powerful and controversial record promoters of the 
1980s, is accused of making cash payments to radio station employees in 
California and Texas in exchange for their promises to broadcast certain 
records promoted by Isgro. 
</P>
<P>
He is also charged with supplying radio station program directors with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Isgro, Anderson and Monka have pleaded not guilty to all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers first became aware of the withheld documents after Lynch 
reportedly let slip that he had more specific information about a money 
laundering scheme in which Isgro's bodyguard, David Michael Smith, allegedly 
acted as a courier between Isgro and Di Ricco. Smith testified in court on 
Tuesday and Wednesday that in the mid-1980s he had made several trips between 
San Francisco and Los Angeles to pick up briefcases containing between $60,000 
and $100,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Monka's attorney, Gerson S. Horn, uncovered the court documents that conflict 
with Di Ricco's grand jury testimony. In a conference in Judge Ideman's 
chambers, he questioned Lynch further about the laundering scheme. "I thought 
Di Ricco denied he ever gave cash to Smith," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Horn recalled prosecutor Lynch responding, "he didn't give cash in 1983." 
With that statement, "we knew the government had lied," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
If the transcript of the San Francisco trial is determined to contradict the 
Los Angeles grand jury testimony from Di Ricco, Ideman said he may dismiss the 
government's case "with prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
One key issue, Ideman said, will be whether "Isgro could be indicted in the 
absence of" the questioned testimony. If the case is dismissed, prosecutors 
could appeal. If Ideman's ruling is overturned, the defendants could then be 
retried.

VIDEO GAME MAKERS READY AD BLITZES; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: USING VASTLY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, SEGA AND NINTENDO ARE TRYING TO 
ENTICE CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS EARLY IN AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC MARKET.

<P>
Michael Jackson has thrown his hat into the video game ring. In fact, his hat 
becomes a weapon that Mr. Moonwalker tosses at the bad guys -- in a new video 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is just one of a handful of big-name celebrities in Sega of America's 
new video game marketing arsenal. Others include heavyweight boxing champion 
James (Buster) Douglas, San Francisco 49er quarterback Joe Montana and Los 
Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda. All will appear in Sega's new video 
games as well as in a $10-million ad campaign being launched next week for 
Sega's ballyhooed "Genesis" video game system. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, giant Nintendo also plans to launch its new $35-million ad 
campaign next week. 
</P>
<P>
The two rivals are trying to attract early Christmas buyers in an uncertain 
economic market. Sega would like nothing better than to muscle into Nintendo's 
dominance of the $3-billion video game industry. Analysts say Nintendo commands 
80% of the market, compared to Sega's 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The two campaigns appear to have far different strategies. Nintendo won't be 
using celebrities. Meanwhile, in a Nintendo-bashing ad campaign that vows, 
"Genesis does what Nintendon't," Sega mirrors the tactics of such 
celebrity-laden advertisers as Nike, L.A. Gear, Coke and Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrities can work incredibly well, if they're relevant to the product," 
said Mike Agate of the Los Angeles consulting firm Mike Agate Associates. "But 
generally these people are horribly expensive. You've got to justify them by 
incremental increases in sales." 
</P>
<P>
Sega will pay about $10 million over the next two years to the celebrities it 
has signed, estimates Michael Katz, president of the consumer products division 
at Sega. He says Sega will get its money's worth if the company can double 
annual sales of its popular Genesis system hardware to 1 million units. The 
hardware retails for about $189. 
</P>
<P>
"Our celebrities deliver a very targeted message to a very jaded audience," 
said Patrick Henry, management supervisor of the Los Angeles office of Bozell, 
the agency that created the campaign for Sega. Besides TV commercials, the 
campaign features a 69-second ad featuring Jackson that will be shown in movie 
theaters. The ad intermixes scenes from Jackson's "Moonwalker" music video with 
animated action from the video games. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson did more than Moonwalk for Sega. He made several trips to Japan to help 
design the video. In fact, the idea of featuring Jackson tossing his hat at 
pursuing villains in the video game came from Jackson himself, said Al Nilsen, 
Sega's marketing director. "Every time someone came up with something he liked, 
he'd say, 'The kids will love this.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a high risk with celebrities," said Katz. For example, boxer 
Douglas has yet to fight since he defeated Mike Tyson in February. Although 
Sega has a two-year contract with Douglas, some boxing experts believe that 
Douglas could lose his next fight. "If he loses, we will no longer be able to 
refer to him as world champion," said Katz. "But hopefully the game would still 
sell." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after former heavyweight champion Tyson lost to Douglas, Tyson's name 
was taken off Nintendo's boxing video game. "Our deal with him ran out about 
the time he got clobbered," said Don Coyner, manager of advertising at the 
Redmond, Wash.-based domestic distributor, Nintendo of America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was replaced by a fictional character named "Mr. Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Nintendo learned some sort of lesson from that experience. "We believe 
the product can sell itself," said Coyner. The campaign will mostly support 
GameBoy, a hand-held video game that Nintendo introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Why all of this maneuvering in early September? 
</P>
<P>
Video game makers are worried about the economy. Sega is even offering an extra 
game cartridge free to those who buy Genesis hardware before Oct. 31. "The 
economy now is not the strongest it's ever been," said Katz. "We want to get 
the product moving."

Marine Master Sgt. George Spear, a single father, bought his son a souvenir 
T-shirt on a recent Louisiana trip. Once home, he realized that he mistakenly 
had bought one reading: "My mother went to New Orleans and all I got was this 
stinking shirt." 
</P>
<P>
Spear threw it in the trash. His son, Brian, 17, found it and teased him -- 
"Dad, don't you know who you are?" 
</P>
<P>
These days, Spear is finding out. A Marine Corps journalist based at Camp 
Pendleton, he left Thursday for the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
He is a member of a new breed of Marine -- single parents. For this group, 
rapid deployment to the Persian Gulf posed questions that critics traditionally 
have aimed at women: Are they ready for action? And what about the kids? 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation, Spear says every Marine -- single or not -- is prepared. 
Marine children are ready for their parents' abrupt departure. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for them, and for thousands of other military families, the recent U.S. 
deployment in the Persian Gulf has only underscored a familiar reality. Life 
with the armed services can be hard not only on soldiers but on their kin, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the current crisis, Spear volunteered to go. When he and a colleague stood 
before their colonel, they realized that one of them would go. Spear looked at 
his colleague, a married man with young children. Spear volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an old war horse," explained the 40-year-old Alabama native, who has been 
a Marine for almost 22 years and served in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
But trying to explain his actions to Brian, who has learning disabilities, was 
harder. That night, Spear returned to his Oceanside home with the usual 
fast-food dinner for two. Brian skateboarded up to meet his dad, seemingly 
sensing that something was wrong. "I said it wasn't something he had done, but 
something I had done," Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't like to talk about being separated from Brian. It makes his eyes 
well with tears. And even today, crying doesn't seem macho. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the loneliest moment in a Marine's life when he has to turn his 
kids loose," he said. "It's like opening up your chest and pulling out your 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Spear sat down with Brian, showed him Kuwait on a map, explained to his son 
that he would live with Spear's mother and go to school in Cullman, Ala. And he 
tried to make Brian understand how his life is going to change. 
</P>
<P>
Cullman is a tiny town and the grandmother with whom he will live has few of 
what Brian regards as modern necessities, such as cable television. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before he left, Spear took care of essentials. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine walking out of your house," he said, "not knowing when you are coming 
back. Where do you put the car? Do you keep the cable TV? Discontinue the 
paper? What about the lawn? And the electricity? Do you need to keep the phone? 
My main concern is the doggone bills. It's quite an ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, you have to sever every connection -- with your family, 
society, friends. We know that's a professional hazard, that if we are called 
we have got to be ready. Physically, we are prepared, but emotionally you are 
vulnerable. When you leave flesh and blood behind, it tears at you." 
</P>
<P>
As he drove Brian to the airport, the boy kept asking, "Are you going to be OK, 
Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
Spear kept remembering how, after he had split with his wife and had taken 
Brian, then 3, to live with his mother, Brian had kept screaming, "Daddy! 
Daddy! Don't leave me, Daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
But this separation was different. "This time," Spear said, "he wasn't 
screaming it, but he was feeling it." 
</P>
<P>
And this time, Spear was fighting tears. He was sure Brian would come unhinged 
if he saw his dad cry. He hugged his boy, walked 10 steps from the gate, smiled 
and waved. Brian, looking hesitant, boarded the plane. Tears streamed down 
Spear's face as he drove from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
He went home and wept. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a Marine," he said, "is not as simple as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
"If the Army had wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued you one!" 
</P>
<P>
Once, it was more than Army bombast -- enlisted men needed permission to marry. 
Marriage was forbidden in the lowest ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Armed Forces must not only accommodate wives -- often from another 
country and culture -- but husbands of women in the military. (As of 1989, 
there were 229,000 women in the military, 10.8% of the total, a number that has 
increased dramatically since the male draft ended in 1973 and the all-volunteer 
force began.) 
</P>
<P>
In a 1989 report, "Families in the Army," the RAND Corp. identified other 
trends. More than half of today's Army wives have paid jobs; one in 10 Army 
personnel are members of families in which both partners are on active duty; 
there are more single-parent families headed by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Nancy Perez, a Navy family, are more traditional. They got engaged 
two weeks after her high school graduation. Then, he shipped out. When he 
returned from a six-month cruise, they were married. That was 11 years ago. She 
was 18; he was 22. 
</P>
<P>
On June 23, Perez, a chief petty officer aboard the carrier Independence, left 
on a routine five-month cruise. Earlier this month, she heard on the news that, 
as part of the Mideast crisis, his ship had been sent to the Gulf of Oman. She 
has no idea when he may come home. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Perez knew nothing about Navy life before meeting Daniel, a New Year's 
Eve blind date arranged by their mothers. She learned fast. When their 
daughter, Kristin, now 7, was two weeks old, he went to sea for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was really rough," she says. She and Kristin came to California to 
stay with her parents. "We left our apartment in Virginia with all of our stuff 
in it." It was burglarized. "I had to fly back and take care of that." 
</P>
<P>
Today, she takes separations in stride, reminding herself, "Hey, you've just 
got to keep on living." Her job in the Antelope Valley Bank boosts their income 
and helps time pass. 
</P>
<P>
About a week before Daniel left this time, they saw a house they liked in Sun 
City. She has bought it. Meanwhile, she and Kristin are saving for the house by 
living with her parents near Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
When he returns, he will commute from Sun City to his home base, Coronado. The 
cost of San Diego homes is prohibitive for them -- and they prefer not to live 
in Navy housing: "He doesn't want to have to work and come home to it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kristin will begin school next month near her grandparents' home and will 
transfer to a Sun City school in December, when the house will be finished. 
"It's going to be hard on her," Nancy says, "but she's really strong. She's not 
a wimpy little kid." 
</P>
<P>
Perez writes to Nancy and Kristin. "She can't finish his letters," Nancy says. 
"She comes out crying. He writes her some really good letters, explaining 
what's happening. He explained to her that there was some fighting going on and 
the United States was trying to help." 
</P>
<P>
She just takes things "day by day." She sends him care packages, with news 
clippings, candy and cookies. "I feel pretty safe that he's on a ship," she 
says. "I think I would be dying if he was in the Army or the Marines." 
</P>
<P>
At Ft. Irwin, the Army's National Training Center in the Mojave Desert, a 
Mexican-born 4-foot-11 soldier in camouflage fatigues and combat boots is 
helping soldiers and families through the current crisis, just as she helps 
them through the crises of everyday life. She is Col. Pilar Franco, USA, a 
doctor who is chief of community mental health service. 
</P>
<P>
"Families become very alarmed and concerned when there's a possibility of war," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
In times of peace, she deals with other family matters, "sometimes serious 
things like spouse abuse, child abuse. We do need the soldiers to be violent in 
the battlefield . . . but some of them don't have clear boundaries." This is 
not unique to the military, she says, but "soldiers are getting the idea that 
this is something that's not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"Going to war," she says, is the No. 1 concern of wives. Another is training 
accidents, maybe a chopper that goes down. 
</P>
<P>
There are problems, too, stemming from loneliness. "Wherever soldiers go, they 
find wives," Franco says. Many of them are from distant lands with far 
different cultures. Many such marriages are doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it's our younger soldiers," she says, "and they marry someone just as 
young and immature and unskilled. They find out marriage is more than just 
liking each other and having sex. Many of them don't even understand each 
other" because the woman speaks limited English. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the women, she notes, come from countries where "prostitution is an 
honorable, respectable way of making a living." Perhaps they were bought as 
brides at a dance hall. They have Hollywood visions of America -- two cars in 
every garage, big houses. Instead, "they come and find the squalor in which a 
soldier below the poverty line lives here. They need money and they want to 
work. And guess what they want to work at." 
</P>
<P>
Even where conflicting cultures are not a factor in military marriages, youth 
and poverty pose severe strains. Franco paints a typical picture: "The wife is 
17, pregnant, away from her home with no phone, living in a trailer park 
somewhere, scared to death. He takes the only vehicle. She feels like a 
prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% of Ft. Irwin's families live off post. There is a military wife who 
serves as mayor for these families, just as on post, there is a wife serving as 
mayor for each of the housing zones. There is an outreach program providing van 
transportation to the PX or the hospital. The volunteer Army Community Service 
supplies baby carriages, pots and pans and children's clothing to needy 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that in today's Army, spouses and children no longer are 
called dependents but family members, which is thought psychologically 
preferable. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Franco says, military children tend to be "more resilient" than their 
civilian counterparts. When they come to her for counsel, it is apt to be to 
express fears that their father is going to be killed or that they dare not 
make waves lest he lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
And, faced with long separations, many military wives grow strong. Sometimes 
that, too, creates domestic conflict. Says Franco: "He comes back and wants to 
take over again. But she's become more capable and she's not going to give up 
the skills she's learned" and the self-esteem that goes with that. 
</P>
<P>
For families with no built-in support system, a personal crisis like deployment 
of a son or daughter to the Mideast can be a frighteningly lonely experience. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Contatore, a marketing professional who lives in Playa del Rey, is a 
soldier's mother. Her only child, 2nd Lt. Daniel R. Kral, 23, stationed at Ft. 
Hood, Tex., with the 2nd Armored Division, called about two weeks ago to say he 
would be shipping out to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
At first, she says, she "cried nonstop." To her, Kral is still "my little boy." 
She had been a single parent from the time he was 6. She describes Kral, a 
career military man, as "very devoted to the Army and to his men and to his 
country. I respect him a lot for the way he feels." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she's sick with worry. She admits, "If I could grab him and run away 
with him, I would do it. But Danny wouldn't like that. Danny is not someone who 
runs away." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband of a year visited her son at Ft. Hood recently to help shut 
up his apartment. "I also had to arrange to be his power of attorney," she 
says. "That's what blew me away." 
</P>
<P>
Long before women wore uniforms, there was a special breed called military 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
Officers' wives, in particular, had a clearly defined role. They were 
helpmates, whose conduct could make or break a husband's career. They were not 
to be controversial. They were to be full-time homemakers, perfect hostesses, 
unflappable mothers. 
</P>
<P>
That traditional world of military wives -- one largely unchanged until the 
1980s -- is described by Bonnie Domrose Stone, wife of a retired Navy chief, 
and Betty Alt, wife of an Air Force colonel, in their new book, "Uncle Sam's 
Brides." 
</P>
<P>
Stone, who grew up in Los Angeles and lives in Lancaster, reared three sons 
while moving from pillar to post during 20 years as a Navy wife. She said in an 
interview that she would not do it again by choice. "You can't choose where you 
live, where your kids go to school or who your friends are going to be. That's 
all determined by the man you marry." 
</P>
<P>
Stone writes: "The military officer's wife is expected to play the part of 
dress-up Barbie to his GI Joe." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewing military wives for the book, she found that loneliness and what 
she calls the "Berlin Wall" that exists between officers' wives and enlisted 
men's wives -- the caste system -- were most often mentioned as negatives. 
</P>
<P>
Stone and Alt also found that economic hardship is a way of life for many in 
the military. Because enlisted men and their families often live at poverty 
level, more than $11 million in food stamps were redeemed in 1988 at military 
commissaries, they learned. 
</P>
<P>
Basic pay for active duty military personnel starts at about $700 a month for 
the lowest enlisted rank; a private makes about $800, a corporal about $900, a 
sergeant about $1,100, a master sergeant just over $2,000. Until recent years, 
there was no mandate for a military wife to receive any part of her husband's 
retirement benefits in case of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
For Bonnie Stone, the "biggest crisis" as a Navy wife was early in her 
pregnancy with her youngest son, Paul, now 21. Stone caught German measles from 
her middle son, and, in the face of warnings from doctors that the fetus might 
be damaged, she and her husband decided against an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he left" for sea duty, she says, "and I was left to carry through the 
pregnancy." Paul was born deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Times change, and the military with them. Stone sees more change coming as the 
"old guard" dies off and women's liberation and economic necessity dictate a 
different role for military wives. 
</P>
<P>
Coffees and teas, with officers' wives in proper white gloves and hats, are 
only a memory. To a new generation of wives, they seem as quaint as the 
once-mandatory courtesy call on senior officers, complete with engraved 
his-and-hers calling cards. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis and Connie Duffey represent a new generation of military families. 
</P>
<P>
They married in 1979, the summer of their graduation from Siena College, a 
Catholic school near Albany, N.Y. In college, he joined the Army ROTC. So did 
she. 
</P>
<P>
As newlyweds, they were both second lieutenants, he in flight school at Ft. 
Rucker, Ala., she at Ft. Bragg, N.C. But when she became pregnant -- an 
unplanned pregnancy -- in fall, 1980, they decided that, as she puts it, "two 
of us in the military was not going to hack it. Our priority was our children." 
She resigned, then an option. 
</P>
<P>
In 11 years of marriage, the Duffeys have moved six times, including more than 
two years in Seoul, Korea. They now live on post at the National Training 
Center at Ft. Irwin, an isolated enclave outside of Barstow in the Mojave 
Desert. Dennis Duffey, a major and a helicopter pilot, is commander of the 
247th Medical Detachment. The family includes Maureen, 9, and Patrick, 3, who 
was born in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Duffey is a career Army man. A college biology major, he chose to be a Medivac 
pilot so as to "help injured soldiers, as opposed to killing people." 
</P>
<P>
The Duffeys know from experience that a crisis deployment could happen with 
little notice. In October, 1983, he was told something secret was in the works. 
Three days later, he was on a plane bound for Grenada, where he spent three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
It was Thanksgiving before she and Dennis talked, she calling from a 
communications tent at Ft. Bragg, he answering on a field telephone. He recalls 
the conversation: "How're you doing? Over. I love you. Over. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Duffeys are outgoing people, quick to laugh, respectful of one another's 
opinions and of the right to voice them. They exchange affectionate repartee. 
</P>
<P>
The Duffeys share a conviction that Army life is what you make of it. In Seoul, 
she kept the books for an officers' wives' club duty-free shop, which grossed 
more than $2 million a year and contributed to American and Korean charities. 
She learned silk embroidery and created the framed tapestry that hangs in their 
quarters. And she learned to like kimchi, a spicy Korean cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
Like Army posts around the world, Ft. Irwin is a self-contained community with 
a Post Exchange, commissary, bowling alley, movie theater, chapels and a 
hospital. Maureen goes to the on-post school, where Connie is a substitute 
teacher. Patrick is dropped at an on-post day care home. 
</P>
<P>
She belongs to the officers' wives club and goes to luncheons but has not 
signed up for any fall activities, such as bridge, Cajun cooking or quilting. 
</P>
<P>
She sees her role as Dennis's wife as an "unspoken assignment." But, she 
emphasizes, whatever she does, or doesn't do, "certainly doesn't reflect on his 
efficiency report." 
</P>
<P>
She has seen significant changes in military family life in the last decade. 
Community involvement is more of a priority among wives; strictly social 
gatherings have largely given way to fund-raisers for causes such as holiday 
food baskets for soldiers' families. 
</P>
<P>
If she were giving advice to a new military wife, Connie Duffey says, she would 
tell her, first, to "get to know the other wives in the unit" and "to know what 
your husband does." 
</P>
<P>
Her other advice to a military wife: "Always remember that this duty station is 
not where you'll spend the rest of your life."

MENSWEAR: FOR FALL, VERRI COLLECTION OFFERS AN ELEGANT STYLE HARKING BACK TO 
THE '60S AND SOON TO BE FEATURED IN 'GODFATHER III.'

In case anyone hasn't noticed, Rodeo Drive has become a mecca for men's suit 
makers, particularly the 400 north block. It's already home to Polo/Ralph 
Lauren, Carroll &amp; Co., Bijan, Claude Montana, Gianni Versace and Giorgio 
Armani, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best location," says Pino Innocente, the Milan-based co-owner of 
Verri, an upscale men's clothing manufacturer that joined the pack this summer 
at 431 N. Rodeo Drive. Innocente's partner, Leonardo Brugognone, designs the 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
Named for its original location on Via Verri in Milan, Verri is known for its 
contemporary Italian styling ("our character is in the shoulder and the lapel") 
and expensive fabrics (suits retail for about $1,500). 
</P>
<P>
Rod Stewart, Warren Beatty and Ryan O'Neal are customers of the Verri store on 
Madison Avenue in New York. The late Andy Warhol, Innocente says, would buy six 
new blue double-breasted jackets each season, which he always wore with blue 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Verri label continues to be available at other stores in Los 
Angeles, especially Ecru and Avedon, the Rodeo Drive shop is the company's U.S. 
flagship. In his six-year search for the best location in Southern California, 
Innocente considered the not-yet completed Rodeo Two complex on Wilshire 
Boulevard, but decided its Old World European design was "too fake." He looked 
at Melrose Avenue but that wouldn't do. To his mind, "the king of Melrose is 
the Maxfield boutique." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to distinguish the Verri look from its competitors on the block, 
Innocente puts it in show business terms. "If you say Armani, you say 'The 
Untouchables.' (He refers to the 1987 film for which Armani supplied the 
suits.) If you say Versace, you say rock star. (Everyone from George Michael to 
Bruce Springsteen have been guests at the flamboyant designer's villa.) If you 
say Verri, after December you say, 'Godfather III.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, working in conjunction with Academy Award-winning costume designer 
Milena Canonero, Verri provided the production with about 250 suits as well as 
shirts, ties and overcoats to be worn by the film's principal actors, including 
Al Pacino, Joe Mantegna and Andy Garcia. "It's very Sicilian, really dressy," 
says Innocente. 
</P>
<P>
Verri, not coincidentally, is promoting the "Godfather III" look in its fall 
collection (and, currently, in its windows). It is a four-button, 
double-breasted suit with very wide (4 7/8 inches) peaked lapels. The trousers, 
pleated and baggy, taper at the ankle. Ties are wide and made of wild prints. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the look makes a strong '60s-through-'70s statement, which is 
where fashion trends in general are focused for the moment. "Everything is 
going back to the '60s. It was the most elegant period for men," Innocente 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Verri introduced a women's collection, tailored dresses, suits 
and coats, clearly inspired by men's tailoring. It is also available at the new 
store.

THE RIGHT SUIT FOR MEN WHO WOULD BE FISH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new surf style washed up on the Oceanside beach at the 14th annual World 
Bodysurfing Championships -- a Neoprene wet suit with built-in fins called a 
Sharkfin. More than anything it resembles a body surfing board. 
</P>
<P>
The look is pure Marvel Comics superhero. 
</P>
<P>
A plastic flotation shell on the garment's chest and small fins (femur skegs) 
attached to the thighs, give body surfers "more traction and directional 
control over the course of the wave," manufacturer Richard Shumacher says. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was designed by industrial designer Jairo Lizarazu, who has been body 
surfing for 14 years. "It's bio-technic surfing, or making a human into a 
fish," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Every time a Sharkfin prototype was tested it drew a crowd of onlookers. The 
attention was not lost on the test pilots, one of whom called the suit "the 
ultimate babe tool." 
</P>
<P>
The $195-$295 retail cost of Sharkfin suits has given Dave Hollander, owner of 
Becker Surf and Sports, pause. One drawback, he says, is that body boarders (a 
market the Sharkfin is aimed at) are youngsters ages 6 to 14 who grow too fast 
for a $200 suit to be practical. And as soon as they can afford it they buy 
surfboards. Plus, he notes, it takes a good-sized wave to appreciate the 
hydrodynamics of the Sharkfin and those waves are dominated by surfers. "A body 
surfer would be cut to shreds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hollander admits, "I've been wrong about a lot of things, like 
Boogie boards and Rollerblades." GAILE ROBINSON

The fashion mystery of the summer is finally solved. Charles Gallay just opened 
his new store, Gallay Melrose, to show what's been brewing for months behind 
those construction barriers. Gallay Melrose, "for people of the '90s," the 
owner says, will feature some new designer names Gallay brought back from the 
cutting edge -- notably Martin Margiela of Paris, who apprenticed there with 
Jean Paul Gaultier. And he'll give play to Vivienne Westwood, London's 
long-established mother of eccentric invention. In the past, Gallay has been 
among the city's first retailers to carry such vanguard labels as Azzedine 
Alaia, Romeo Gigli and, earlier, Sonia Rykiel and Karl Lagerfeld at his Alaia 
boutique, his Gallay shop on Sunset Boulevard and at the Charles Gallay store 
in Beverly Hills -- which he closed several years ago. As for what to wear in 
the new decade, Gallay suggests: "Clean, tight and sexy clothes, with some 
romance." 
</P>
<P>
CLOTHES THAT RATE: When Bill Cosby and Bart Simpson went head to head last 
week, Cosby made some concessions in his wardrobe. He exchanged his well-known 
sweaters for a new look of shirts and hand-painted ties. Marienbad, the design 
team that supplied many of the colorful crew necks, doesn't mind the switch 
because they also are supplying the ties (available for about $65 from Sami 
Dinar). The ratings win for Cosby indicates the public prefers characters in 
hand-painted ties to hand-painted characters. 
</P>
<P>
SUFFERIN' HANDBAGS: What do working women want? "Much more affordable 
accessories," says Paloma Picasso. Her By Paloma Picasso collection, introduced 
last week at I. Magnin in Beverly Hills, is priced from $95 to $380 (down from 
the $200 to $5,000 couture line she launched two years ago). While her new 
collection has "softer, more easygoing" shoulder bags, the designer says she's 
all in favor of the European penchant for constructed bags with short handles: 
"American women are keen on things that are practical. In Europe, you learn you 
have to suffer to be beautiful." Put that in your vive la difference! file. 
</P>
<P>
OAT COUTURE: Have you seen those billboards from the Milk Advisory Board with 
all the people dressed like cows in black and white Holstein-print clothing? 
Folks who have want to own those two-tone bathing suits and spotted shorts. In 
fact, the MAB received so many phone calls it entered a marketing contract with 
Rainbeau, a San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, to produce T-shirts, 
weightlifter's pants, tights, bike shorts, leotards and beachwear in the bovine 
print. The cow clothes are available at Allez in Santa Monica and Glendale, 
Alva's Dance and Theatric Company in San Pedro, Atascadero Fitness in 
Atascadero and the P.C.H. Pro Shop in Torance. Visions of raisins probably 
motivated this marketing tactic.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SANDWICHES AND DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: From time to time, you have written about a variety of different 
foods, including fast food, Mexican and Chinese food. What about submarine 
sandwiches? Can they be part of a normal diet, or are they more like cake, to 
be eaten once in a while but not to be made a regular part of a diet? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Today's submarine sandwich is not the same as it was when first 
introduced. Not only are different kinds of rolls and breads being used, but 
the ingredients that make up the sandwiches are different. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the submarine sandwich contained Italian meats and cheese. Today 
the fillings include a variety of salads such as seafood, tuna and chicken, as 
well as ham, turkey and roast beef. Moreover, a "submarine sandwich" can even 
be made with a pita pocket, which can be filled with a variety of fresh 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluating the nutritional value of a submarine sandwich, we can consider 
the bread, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and peppers as acceptable components of a 
diet. The diet remains acceptable with the addition of such meats as turkey and 
roast beef. The sandwich only begins to pose a problem if you add high-fat 
cheeses and other high-fat, high-calorie items. Fish is usually considered a 
good choice as a filling, but not when it contains a large amount of 
mayonnaise, which adds both calories and fat. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184, 
Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. He cannot give personal replies but will answer as 
many questions as possible in his column.

JAZZ NOTES: GRATIS CONCERTS GROW AT IAOJA FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation founder and president William J. 
Coffey Jr. envisioned a jazz festival in Los Angeles a few years ago, he wanted 
to have a half a dozen or so free events at venues scattered throughout the 
Southland. He's getting closer to his dream. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the association's third annual International Jazz Festival has three 
free concerts, up from one in 1988 and two in 1989. "Hey, it's growing," said 
Coffey. The gratis events -- all to be held Saturday, noon-3 p.m. -- will 
feature trombonist Luis Bonilla and guitarist Phil Upchurch at Barnsdall Park 
(4800 Hollywood Blvd.); bassist Larry Gales and saxman Rickey Woodard at Jim 
Gilliam Park (4000 S. La Brea Ave., Baldwin Hills), and the IAOJA "Jazz Goes to 
School" Band and violinist Susie Hansen at UCLA's Westwood Plaza (near parking 
lots 4 or 6 on Westwood Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
"We think these events are very important to what we do, in terms of educating 
the public and making jazz music accessible and affordable," said Coffey. "A 
$20 ticket, or having to travel a long way for an event, cuts a lot of folks 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The free shows will be followed by two ticketed concerts to be held Saturday 
and Sunday, 7-11 p.m., at UCLA's Royce Hall. Singer Dianne Reeves, pianist 
Dorothy Donegan and Gerald Wilson's Orchestra of the '90s are on tap Saturday, 
and keyboardist Joe Zawinul's Syndicate, singer Dwight Sills and organist Joey 
DeFrancesco -- CBS Records artists all -- will appear Sunday. Tickets are 
$9-$20. Information: (213) 825-9261. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, Zawinul and DeFrancesco are among those donating their services for the 
performances, proceeds from which benefit the "Jazz Goes to School" program, a 
seven-week course covering the history and culture of jazz as it relates to the 
history and culture of America. In February, the course will be presented at a 
dozen Los Angeles area schools for the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in high school in Denver, we had people like (saxophonist) Oliver 
Nelson and (trumpeter) Clark Terry come by and lecture and play and that 
heightened our awareness of, and curiousity for, jazz," said Reeves. "Then 
later, performing with a school band at the National Assn. of Jazz Educators 
convention in Chicago, that started my career. With IAOJA going into the 
schools, I wanted to be a part of that because something similar made me aware 
of a wonderful and sophisticated music." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to keep jazz out there," said Zawinul as to why he was 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey says that the thrust behind his jazz-in-school program is simply to 
build and maintain an audience for his favorite art form.. "If students become 
familiar with, and hopefully appreciate, jazz, then when they become adults, 
perhaps they'll support it since they've had prior exposure," he said. "If only 
1% of all (high school) graduates appreciated jazz music, it would enough 
broad-based support for musicians to do what they like to do -- which is play. 
Most jazz artists can't make a living at what they like to do."

WRITE ON: John Lewis, David Murray, George Russell and Steve Lacy are among the 
jazz musicians who have been given composition grants (ranging from 
$11,000-$21,000) by the Meet the Composer/Reader's Digest Commissioning Fund, 
which operates in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts. Lewis, 
of Modern Jazz Quartet fame, will compose a piece for guitarist Charlie Byrd 
and the Annapolis Brass Quintet; saxophonists Murray, Hamiet Bluiett and Oliver 
Lake will write a work for saxophone quartet and three African drummers; 
pianist/bandleader Russell will concoct a piece for his Living Time Orchestra,

RESURRECTING AN INDIAN TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC MUSIC: AS A BOY, ALVINO SIVA HEARD THE INDIAN BIRD SONGS FROM ELDERS. 
NOW, HE IS TRYING TO RE-CREATE MELODIES THAT ARE ONLY A FAINT ECHO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvino Siva had scarcely passed 5 years of age when the Cahuilla Indian Bird 
Songs first stirred his soul. The 1920s were drawing to a close, and Siva was 
living on the Agua Caliente Reservation east of here, in a stark desert land 
shared with the cactus and coyote. 
</P>
<P>
On holidays and other festive occasions, the bird songs would emerge -- flowing 
from the lips of Cahuilla tribal elders who, in turn, had adopted them from 
their forebears. With their complex rhythms, haunting melodies and accompanying 
dance steps, the ancient bird songs were entrancing to a young boy -- a 
challenge and a joy to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have these huge feasts, these celebrations, and then the singing and 
dancing would start," recalled Siva, whose parents picked fruit on the region's 
sprawling ranches. "It would go on for hours, all night long, and we kids would 
follow along with the old people as best we could." 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Siva mastered many of the songs, but when World War II 
erupted, he was swept off to battle. The young combat engineer chose to make a 
career of the Army, and, although he would occasionally murmur a bird song 
while alone on sentry duty, his repertoire gradually ebbed away. 
</P>
<P>
Siva is now 67, and he is worried. The bird songs -- once such a vital, 
inspiring part of Cahuilla tradition -- have lost their place in tribal life, 
having died with the elders who knew them so well. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to preserve this element of Cahuilla culture for generations yet 
unborn, Siva is attempting to resurrect the songs and rekindle an interest in 
them among younger Native Americans. With two other tribal members -- Robert 
Levi of Riverside and Sat Torres of Thermal, Calif., near the Salton Sea -- 
Siva has formed the Cahuilla Bird Singers. The group's goal is to record a 
collection of songs and share them with anyone who might listen. 
</P>
<P>
The bird singers will make two appearances next month at the Los Angeles 
Festival, joining other Native American artists at the Pan-Indian Pow Wow over 
Labor Day weekend and performing at UCLA's Sunset Canyon Amphitheatre Sept. 4. 
They can also be heard at occasional music festivals throughout Southern 
California and at the annual May fiesta on the Morongo Indian Reservation near 
Banning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art at the Bowers Museum in Santa 
Ana, bird songs are not specifically about birds. Nor do they mimic the 
chirping sounds made by the winged creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Apodaca wrote in a paper on the subject, the songs speak of the 
creation of all things on Earth, including humans, animals and plants. Common 
to tribes throughout Southern California, Arizona and Baja California, they 
also chronicle the settling of the planet's mythological First People, 
describing their search for a hospitable homeland and the hardships that 
confronted them along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have no ceremonial or spell-casting purpose, the songs have a 
distinctive magical sound. As the Cahuilla trio's sonorous voices mingle with 
the crisp swish of their gourd rattles, an attentive listener can wander easily 
into a rapturous trance, with visions of the settlers' adventures dancing in 
the mind's eye. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the songs were sung in sequence, with each work representing a 
chapter in the First People's journey. So numerous were the songs that 
performers typically began singing at sunset and continued past daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, Siva said, the Cahuilla songs' proper sequence -- along with the 
meaning of 90% of the lyrics -- has been lost. Although bird songs have 
fascinated anthropologists and have been described as perhaps the oldest music 
in America, there has been little formal research or documentation of the 
subject. So when the old "master singers" died, the meaning and traditional 
cycle of the songs perished as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad, and it's frustrating to me now because I had a chance to ask 
the old people, to write it all down," Siva said. "But we were young. We just 
didn't think the songs would disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Many have been salvaged. Over the past several years, Siva, Levi and Torres 
have searched their memories for shreds of melodies, fragments of lyrics. In 
such a way, they have managed to reassemble many of the historic works. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I'd be outside in my garden and I'd think of a song, run inside and 
tape record it," said Levi, 72, a brawny, bear of a man 
</P>
<P>
who learned the songs from his grandfather. "At first I would forget the song 
by the time I got the tape recorder going. But now it's all set up, so I just 
have to push a button." 
</P>
<P>
Songs return to Siva in a similar fashion, but at times the experience can be 
aggravating: "The worst is when I am lying in bed, and I'll remember a melody 
but I can't find the words. So I'll lie there and hum it, and that'll just 
drive me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Siva said, the group has been able to "remember enough songs so that we 
can sing straight through (in sequence) for about four hours, instead of eight 
hours, like we should." 
</P>
<P>
While the meaning of most of the lyrics still eludes them, the knowledge of 
just a few words frequently enables them to piece together a song's subject. 
Like a crucial piece in a puzzle, that discovery can sometimes enable the 
singers to string together several works in sequence, said Levi, a World War II 
Army veteran himself. 
</P>
<P>
In one song, for example, the First People "feel this strong wind, coming up 
behind them, and they are looking for a place to stay," Levi said. "Then in the 
next song, it's getting cold as the wind is catching up to them." 
</P>
<P>
The following piece tells of "clouds of rain gathering, and then of the rain 
falling on them," Levi said. "There is talk of the mournful cry of the 
bluebird, and the blackbird, and the cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on like this and they finally come down on a high plateau or mountain, 
and see this lush valley below," Levi said. "This, the songs says, is the land 
where they will stay." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Cahuilla Bird Singers obtained a grant from the California Arts 
Council, funds that enabled them to take on three young Native American men as 
apprentices. 
</P>
<P>
With this flicker of interest among their descendants, the Cahuilla Bird 
Singers hope they have ensured a remnant of the ancient songs will endure -- 
even after they are gone. For now, however, Levi said he is treasuring their 
mission for a simpler reason: 
</P>
<P>
"The songs, the dancing, that's the only thing that keeps me going. They make 
me feel real lively, like I'm ready to fly."

A TIMELESS RITUAL FROM JAVA; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: ROYAL COURT DANCERS WILL PERFORM PROGRAMS RICH IN ISLAND HERITAGE 
BEGINNING TODAY AT THE ARBORETUM.

JOGJAKARTA, Central Java 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by statues of giants, symbols of human passion, the massive Danapratapa 
Gate of the Sultan's Palace (or Kraton) dominates a courtyard gleaming with 
antique splendor. 
</P>
<P>
On the left, tourists gawk at gilded sedan chairs and other artifacts of a 
regime that seems an eternal part of Javanese culture -- but in fact came into 
being 20 years before the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
On the right, court dancers perform in a long, low pavilion (once a reception 
hall) that's open on all sides and supported by black wooden pillars decorated 
in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dancers appear isolated in the pavilion's wide, empty space, 
richness envelops them -- starting with the magnificent batiks they wear. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead: eight Waterford chandeliers and a sloping ceiling painted with golden 
starbursts. Underfoot: elegant tiles in green and cream. Behind: the red and 
gold instruments of a gamelan (percussion orchestra) famous for its unique 
honeyed tone. 
</P>
<P>
To be a court dancer today in Jogjakarta is to belong to this majestic, 
intricately ordered environment -- but only on a part-time basis. Since the 
1960s, there has been no permanent dance school or resident company in the 
Sultan's Palace, merely invitational rehearsals there once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the five dozen court artists appearing in three different Los 
Angeles Festival programs at the Los Angeles State and Couty Arboretum in 
Arcadia beginning today are all essentially free-lancers: bound to the Kraton 
both by contract and cultural tradition but also subsisting by other means. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the Indonesian government art academies have replaced the court as a 
central influence -- and, for the veterans in particular, the change in 
conditions has proven to be a process of reduction. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the current touring forces, distinguished musician R.M. Palen 
Suwondo remembers palace performances in the 1920s and '30s that involved 400 
to 500 dancers and musicians. "More people putting on the production than were 
invited to watch it," he said. "You'd start in the morning, go until five in 
the evening, break for two hours and then start again and go until five the 
next morning -- for three days!" The sultan's family and guests came and went 
during these marathons, as did the general populace (allowed to watch from 
certain fenced-off areas). 
</P>
<P>
In those glory days, Kraton dancers had highly specialized careers, recalled 
the dancer Sunartomo, who appears prominently in the Wayang Wong (masked 
dance-drama) performances on the American tour. "Teachers would look at your 
physical shape and select a single role for you," he said. "You studied that 
one character, nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
"Or sometimes the sultan would see someone with no dance training and say, 
'He'd be perfect for a particular character: Get him!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, of course, there is art outside the court. And if you're going to be 
a dancer, you'll need to do more than just one character -- or you won't get 
enough jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Today, men no longer dance all the roles in Wayang Wong, and performances are 
abridged or excerpted to about five hours. (The touring Wayang Wong has been 
shortened even more.) In addition, dance forms that were formerly seen only by 
the court have been adapted for wider viewing -- among them the austere 17th 
Century womens' ritual Bedhaya, included on the program tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Revered Jogjakarta choreographer R. Rio Sasminta Mardawa (a. k. a. Rama Sas) 
emphasized that the metaphysical weight and power of Bedhaya demands the 
dancers' "total concentration and freedom from outside thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
"The first part of Bedhaya," he explained, "reflects the essence of nine women 
trying to become one, going back and forth between their individuality and a 
group identity. Ego and desire tempt people out of the group, away from 
oneness, but when you finally see them down on the floor -- (arranged) 3-3-3, 
in every direction -- you've reached the integration of all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Before performing sacred forms of Bedhaya, he said, "dancers fast for three 
days, taking only water with nothing in it and rice with nothing in it." After 
this cleansing ritual, "they can eat on the day of the dance. But because this 
(public, secular version of Bedhaya) is not a ritual, the dancers won't do 
that. But even if they're not fasting, they must come cleansed and bring no 
(mental) baggage with them." 
</P>
<P>
If Bedhaya once represented a private Kraton heirloom -- performed only by 
relatives of the sultan -- the form named Golek Menak illustrates the 
continuing influence of the Jogjakarta court on Javanese cultural life. Newest 
of traditional court idioms, Golek Menak was commissioned by Hamengku Buwono IX 
in 1941 after a performance by wooden rod puppets (Wayang Golek). 
</P>
<P>
The sultan's idea (as modified over the next four decades): dancing based on 
both puppet motion and Indonesian martial arts, accompanied by vigorous West 
Javanese-style drumming and depicting stories drawn from a beloved Islamic 
epic, the Amir Hamzah romances. 
</P>
<P>
Mardawa danced in the premiere performances of Golek Menak and explained that 
the secret is for the dancers to think of themselves as made of wood. "A slight 
inclination of the neck is possible in dance," he said, "but not in Menak. In 
classical dancing, the hand is mobile, the fingers curl; in Menak, however, the 
hand must be frozen . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he insisted, "the essence (of Menak) comes from classical 
Jogjakarta court style: The smoothness, delicacy, flow, integration of 
movements are the same." 
</P>
<P>
Even for wooden court dancers in a contemporary Kraton, some things never 
change.

CBS MULLS LATE-NIGHT NEWSCAST, BUT 'IT'S NOT DEFINITE'

<P>
CBS News executives are weighing the possibility of introducing a new 
late-night newscast, but the network has no firm plans in place. 
</P>
<P>
CBS planned to run a late-night Persian Gulf special again Thursday night, 
making it the second night in a row that the network has put the team of Lesley 
Stahl and Charles Kuralt up against ABC's popular "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
But while executives at CBS News would like to have a regular forum to discuss 
world events in depth, a special is not scheduled for tonight, and CBS 
spokesman Tom Goodman said Thursday that the network will not run another 
late-night special unless breaking news dictates the need for one. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Goodman said, CBS would like to have another regular news program, and 
is considering using the 11:30 time slot, among others, for such a program. 
"Nightline" developed out of similar news specials on ABC more than 10 years 
ago, when Ted Koppel anchored a nightly broadcast during the Iranian hostage 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely not definite," Goodman said. "This is something that might 
develop into something and it might not." SHARON BERNSTEIN

DISNEY SAYS EX-OFFICIAL TRIED TO RAID PROJECTS 
</P>

<P>
Walt Disney Co., in a lawsuit filed Thursday, accused movie executive David 
Kirkpatrick of trying to raid Disney's film projects and executive ranks in 
violation of an agreement he signed on leaving the studio to join Paramount 
Pictures a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick is currently executive vice president of Paramount's motion picture 
group and previously was production president for Disney's Touchstone and Walt 
Disney Pictures units. 
</P>
<P>
"Mouses that live in glass houses shouldn't call other people louses," said 
Howard Weitzman, an attorney for Kirkpatrick. Weitzman said Kirkpatrick 
strongly denies the claims. 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Disney said Kirkpatrick 
tried to recruit one executive, Donald Granger, and told Disney officers that 
he expected to bring other Disney managers to Paramount, despite having signed 
an agreement not to recruit Disney employees for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Disney also said Kirkpatrick illegally used confidential information obtained 
at Disney to solicit from writer Ed Kaplan and producer Steve Tisch a film 
project called "The Dead Letter Department." 
</P>
<P>
Disney sought unspecified damages, and it asked the court to prevent

five-year employment contract from which Disney had released him. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two studios have often been strained since Michael 
Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg and other executives left Paramount to take charge 
of Disney five years ago.

Gannett Co. will consolidate its two newspaper divisions, with Gary Watson as 
president of the new group, effective Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 45, a 21-year veteran at Gannett, will oversee all of Gannett's daily 
papers, except USA Today. Gannett is the nation's largest newspaper chain, with 
137 daily and non-daily papers. 
</P>
<P>
Watson has been president of Gannett's 60-member community newspaper division 
since December, 1985. The division will be combined with Gannett's metropolitan 
newspaper group, whose current president, Brian J. Donnelly, will become 
executive vice president reporting to Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi Feller, Gannett's vice president for public affairs, confirmed the 
promotion and the consolidation but denied speculation that Watson would become 
second-in-command to Gannett Chairman and President John J. Curley. 
</P>
<P>
Feller said the company's vice chairman and chief financial officer, Douglas H. 
McCorkindale, and USA Today Publisher Cathleen P. Black would remain in those 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's office said he was traveling and was not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, according to the Washington Post, told the newspaper Wednesday that the 
consolidation of the two divisions was partly in response to the increasingly 
tough environment for newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Gannett's newspaper revenue fell 2% in the second quarter, compared to a year 
ago, and was down 1% for the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Feller said the Post was "off base" when it implied that economics was the 
reason for the change. She said the consolidation and promotion of Watson "just 
makes sense organizationally." 
</P>
<P>
She said Gannett created the two newspaper divisions in 1985 when "we were 
making some larger acquisitions of papers. . . . But now we've found that it 
would be better to have it in one place. You don't need to have the overlap." 
</P>
<P>
She said the change would not mean any reductions in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally an administrative restructuring, not a reduction in personnel or 
savings in costs," she said, noting that both divisions previously had been 
operating under one corporate staff. "The corporate staff stays the same. The 
folks running the papers in the field stay the same." 
</P>
<P>
Watson started with Gannett in 1969 at its Rockford (Ill.) Register Star 
newspaper. He held various editing and reporting jobs with the company, and 
later was named president of its Midwestern newspaper division and president of 
the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Civil lawsuit -- An article Aug. 12 incorrectly reported that The Wellington 
Group had been barred from conducting business or occupying its Torrance 
offices as a result of a civil lawsuit brought against the company by the state 
Department of Corporations. In fact, Wellington has remained open, though it 
was barred by the court from selling securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also incorrectly reported that The Wellington Group is part of 
Pentagon Investment Group, a real estate consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the story said the corporation was co-owner of Toluca Court apartments, a 
48-unit building taken over by the state as part of the court action. Roger L. 
Merwin, a Wellington Group vice president, said Wellington never owned a share 
of the building. Mark Harman, an attorney for the state, said state 
investigators believe that Wellington was a co-owner.

months before the attack on Pearl Harbor -- was the 251st Coast Artillery 
Regiment from Southern California, which was sent to Hawaii in November, 1940, 
and later became the first Guard unit to fire shots in World War II.

A military jury today acquitted a veteran paratrooper on charges that he 
unnecessarily killed a Panamanian during the 1989 invasion of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors deliberated nearly two hours before clearing Master Sgt. Roberto 
Bryan. The verdict was greeted by applause from other soldiers in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan sighed with relief. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan, a 19-year Army veteran and member of Ft. Bragg's 82nd Airborne Division, 
was charged with unpremeditated murder. A conviction would have carried a 
sentence of life in prison. 
</P>

The Army had said Bryan, 42, shot a Panamanian with his M-16 rifle without

2 GERMANYS SIGN TREATY ON UNIFICATION

<TEXT>
<P>
One day before the anniversary of the war that drove them apart, the German 
states signed a sweeping treaty today meant as a final blueprint for bringing 
them together. 
</P>
<P>
German leaders met in a 17th-Century palace of German princes to sign the 
document, which seeks to reconcile the stark differences between two societies 
that will form one nation Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The pact will allow East Germany to retain its liberal abortion law and gives 
Western investors more rights to buy East German land, a measure economists say 
is necessary to rescue the nation's dire economy. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls for Berlin to become the capital of a united Germany, guarantees 
some social programs for jobless East Germans and recognizes the five states 
East Germany will become in a united nation. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty leaves many crucial decisions on uniting the nations to the new 
government that will be elected to lead both nations Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The 900-page document was signed by West German Interior Minister Wolfgang 
Schaeuble, and East Germany's top unity negotiator, Guenther Krause. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the cabinets of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German 
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere formally approved the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to German 
unification," De Maiziere said. 
</P>
<P>
The parliaments of the two nations likely will approve the treaty next week. 
</P>
<P>
The signing took place on the eve of the 51st anniversary of World War II. On 
Sept. 1, 1939, Hitler's forces invaded Poland, and France and England declared 
the war that eventually split Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty promises that the new united Germany will respect the borders of its 
European neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The pact reconciles some fundamental legal and political differences between 
the two nations that followed vastly different paths after they were carved 
from the conquered Nazi empire. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble said the goal of the broad accord "was to again standardize what had 
been 45 years of developing separate systems of laws and differing economic and 
living conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The treaty itself was not necessary to German unification because East Germany 
already has voted to merge with West Germany.

SOUTH AFRICA: THE NATIONAL PARTY, WHICH CREATED APARTHEID, FACES DRAMATIC

<P>
In a major turnabout, President Frederik W. de Klerk called today for the 
whites-only ruling National Party to be opened to all races in the drive to end 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the National Party must open its ranks to all South Africans who 
share its basic values and hopes for a multiracial democracy. He said the party 
has to prepare for major changes confronting the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The new South Africa demands that those who belong together through inner 
conviction should come together," he told a party provincial congress in 
Durban. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the National Party to all races would be a historic change for 
the party that created apartheid and attempted to exclude non-whites from 
political power. The party has for decades been the main voice of Afrikaner 
nationalism, representing whites of mostly Dutch descent who dominate South 
African politics. 
</P>
<P>
The president, who also heads the party, asked the congress to give party 
leaders the authority to amend its constitution to admit all races. The 
congress was expected to approve, clearing the way for similar action at other 
provincial party congresses. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said South Africans of all colors who want a free-market economy, 
guaranteed human rights and other protections must band together to work for 
their common goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirement of no (racial) domination means that power has to be shared in 
such a way that a majority will neither have absolute power nor be able to 
abuse its power to the detriment of minorities or for their suppression," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and share power with the black majority. 
But he wants guarantees on rights for the white minority under any future 
black-majority government. 
</P>
<P>
The government is looking for allies among black political groups to buttress 
its position in negotiations with the African National Congress on sharing 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the government declined to confirm reports that scores of political 
prisoners would be released Saturday. The government and the ANC agreed Aug. 6 
on a review process to free political detainees starting from Sept. 1.

Fire broke out in the kitchen of an unlicensed Pasadena boardinghouse where six 
of 20 mentally handicapped residents had been locked in an upstairs room, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the fire, which was reported at 10:12 p.m. Thursday and was 
put out in 12 minutes, Fire Department spokeswoman Julie Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not determined, she said. Two insect defoggers were 
being used in the kitchen when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found that the house at 456 Summit Ave. was being used as a 
board-and-care facility for 20 mentally handicapped adults. Six of them were 
rescued from a locked second-story room, she said. The Red Cross was called in 
to help the residents find shelter, and several dogs and cats were picked up by 
county animal workers.

Worthington, 53, a native of Marathon, Tex., died Monday, his daughter told the

"He was taken hostage in Kuwait and moved to Basra where he died of a heart

Earlier this week, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the body of an American who 
died in the city of Basra would be turned over to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington had been working as a consultant for the Alahi Bank of Kuwait and 
lived in the Hilton Hotel in Kuwait city, family members said. The State

Air travelers frustrated by delays seized control of a jetliner and demanded to 
be flown home, but the plane could not land because of bad weather, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The group was stranded for several days at an airport in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in 
the Soviet Far East, and passengers became angry when the plane's flight crew 
went home, Pravda reported. 
</P>
<P>
The travelers, led by a local official, forced a pilot to make the 300-mile 
flight to the Kuril island of Iturup. 
</P>
<P>
But when the AN-24 plane approached the Iturup runway, it was unable to land 
because of the weather and returned to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Pravda said. The 
newspaper also noted that runways in the region are generally in poor 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The article did not say if the passengers were arrested.

There is no evidence that radiation emissions during the 1979 nuclear accident 
at Three Mile Island affected the health of area residents, an independent 
study released today concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Columbia University scientists said there was no sign that the 
radiation caused leukemia or childhood cancer among people living within 10 
miles of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Those illnesses are more sensitive to low-level radiation than other diseases 
and are the first to appear after exposure, the scientists said in a briefing 
several miles from the nuclear plant near Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were published today in the American Journal of Epidemiology. They 
match the conclusions of a 1985 report, released by the state Health 
Department, that found no evidence of increased cancer in a 20-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest study, Columbia epidemiologists Mervyn Susser and Maureen Hatch 
studied the health records of 160,000 residents of 69 areas within the 10-mile 
radius. They also compared cancer rates between 1975 and 1985.

AAA SEES 2% DROP IN LABOR DAY WEEKEND TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Labor Day weekend travelers will be taking the summer's last fling on the most 
expensive fuel in years, and travel experts say some may just decide to stay 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The American Automobile Assn. expects a 2% decline in air, train, bus and car 
travel from last year -- partly because of rising gasoline prices after Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait and partly because of an economic downturn that predates the 
Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla., says an estimated 25.5 million Americans are 
expected to travel 100 million miles by all modes of transportation during the 
three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Its survey of gas prices showed a plentiful supply, with unleaded regular 
averaging $1.30 a gallon. It also indicated that motorists are paying $2 to $4 
more to fill up an average car's tank. 
</P>
<P>
That should not be enough to affect long-planned trips, said AAA spokesman 
Jerry Cheske, but he said some people who travel on impulse may have second 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Air travel is not expected to be significantly affected by the increase in jet 
fuel prices, because most travelers purchased tickets before the Kuwait 
invasion, said Philip Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of 
Travel Agents. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines have announced some fare increases, but many rolled them back to keep 
planes filled.

A grand jury today indicted Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and two former 
employees on securities fraud charges stemming from millions of dollars in 
customer losses in the stock market crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the corporation, the 42 indictments handed up by a Cuyahoga 
County grand jury named Sheldon Strauss, a former account executive at 
Shearson's Cleveland office, and Stephen Weinberg, the former office manager. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss was charged with fraud and false representations in the sale of 
securities, and Weinberg and the corporation were charged with complicity in 
Strauss's actions. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ohio Division of Securities, which investigated the case, 
said Shearson Lehman has already settled more than $4.9-million worth of claims 
from Strauss's former clients, many of whom suffered extensive losses on "Black 
Monday," Oct. 19, 1987.

OIL PRICES RISE SHARPLY AMID UNCERTAINTY

Oil prices rose sharply for the second straight day today as traders, uncertain 
over what may happen next in the Persian Gulf, bought up supplies in advance of 
the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for October delivery was up 84 cents at $27.61 a barrel after rising 
85 cents Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline rose 
4.43 cents to 93.50 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas was up from $1.537 to $1.548 per 1,000 cubic feet on October 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised at the market's strength," said Chris McCormick, a broker at 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
He and others said they had expected price gains to be limited by an apparent 
easing of tensions in the gulf and OPEC's decision this week to sanction an 
increase in production. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have seesawed this week as traders have alternately looked to the gulf 
and to Vienna, where the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, oil prices fell as tensions seemed to cool in the Middle 
East. After OPEC's decision on production, oil prices dropped to their lowest 
levels since shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But since then prices 
have again crept upward. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC's statement Wednesday freed nations such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and 
the United Arab Emirates to pump more oil to replace most of the 4 million 
barrels lost daily because of the U.N. embargo on Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Although the increases had been widely anticipated, even without an OPEC 
agreement, prices tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
But once the selling was out of the way, traders refocused on the tensions in 
the gulf, and prices began to climb again. 
</P>
<P>
"Four weeks after Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait the future 
developments in the region are as uncertain as ever," according to a report 
from oil brokers E. D. and F. Man International. 
</P>
<P>
October Brent crude, a world benchmark, was quoted at $26.50 a barrel, up 55 
cents from Thursday's New York close. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was thin both in New York and London. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Friday, the gulf is still in crisis, and no one wants to leave their 
(trading) positions open," one London-based broker said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. traders have been making sure they have sufficient supplies for the 
three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger risk is that prices will go up if anything happens in the gulf over 
the weekend," one trader said.

A judge released Chicago Bears rookie running back Johnny Bailey from the final 
10 months of his probation today in a brief courtroom appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, the Bears' ninth-round draft pick from Texas A&amp;I, was placed on 
probation in 1986 after an arrest for possession of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
He faced possible arrest earlier this month for failure to pay about $1,400 in 
probation fines until his attorney paid the fines Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
His probation was supposed to extend through June.

Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr used cocaine for about seven years, but 
says has been drug free since spending two weeks in a substance-abuse center 
last summer, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Journal reported in a copyrighted story today that Fuhr at first 
had lied to Oilers General Manager Glen Sather, who had confronted him several 
times about possible substance abuse, because "it's not something you tell your 
boss." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Sather confirmed that Fuhr, 28, was treated for cocaine 
abuse at the Straight Center in St. Petersburg, Fla., and that he tested 
positive in a private test that his former agent, Rich Winter, pressed him to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
Fuhr said he expected to be suspended for his admissions. Sather said he had 
already contacted National Hockey League President John Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, in a statement this morning, said the league had begun an 
investigation after receiving information indicating that Fuhr "had admitted 
using an illegal drug." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing was set for Sept. 26 in Toronto, site of the NHL Board of Governors' 
meeting.

STEINLEN SEEKS SECOND MILLION WIN IN A ROW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Arlington Million tops a weekend of racing at Arlington International that 
includes Saturday's $500,000 Beverly D. and Monday's $250,000 Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, the 7-year-old English-bred owned by Daniel Wildenstein, is aiming to 
become the first to win the Million in successive years Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry is the only two-time winner of the 1 1/4-mile grass event. The famed 
gelding won the inaugural Million in 1981 with Bill Shoemaker aboard, nosing 
out The Bart in the final jump. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry skipped the 1982 running won by Perrault because of an injury, came 
back to finish second to Tolomeo in 1983 and won again in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion, Steinlen is expected to go off as a 5-2 favorite, 
although in his last race, the 1 1/8-mile Bernard Baruch at Saratoga, he 
finished second to Who's To Pay. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, however, is not disheartened. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been training well, and off his best he can win the Million again," said 
Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, trained by Charlie Whittingham, is among those expected to 
challenge Steinlen. Whittingham has won the Million twice, with Perrault and 
Estrapade in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly D. is the richest turf race in the world for fillies and mares. 
Among the field of 12 are three stakes winners from Europe, including Magic 
Gleam and Alcando from England and Lady Winner from France. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the field for the 1 3/16-mile race are Adira, Capades, Coolawin, 
Reluctant Guest, Double Wedge, Royal Touch, Gaily Gaily, Good Example and Lady 
In Silver. All will carry 123 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Capades, ridden by Angel Cordero, could be a slight favorite to take down the 
winner's share of $300,000 in the wide-open race. The 4-year-old daughter of 
Overskate, a one-time champion in Canada, has earned more than $1 million while 
racing against the best. 
</P>
<P>
In her most recent start, Capades raced against the males in the Caesars 
International Handicap and finished second to Steinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the European invaders, other threats included Adira, Coolawin and 
Reluctant Guest in the third running of the event named in honor of the late 
wife of Arlington owner Richard L. Duchossois. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled is scheduled to make his grass debut Monday in 
the Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled's trainer, Carl Nafzger, said he got more than he expected from 
Unbridled in his first-ever workout on the grass earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"He adapted well to the turf," said Nafzger. "He got hold of it and ran like 
he's been on it before." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger said Unbridled would not run Monday if turf conditions are mushy. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite for the Secretariat, however, could be Warner L. Jones' filly, 
Super Fan. She has been campaigning with success against the males and won the 
recent 1 3/16-mile Round Table at Arlington.

BAYAKOA ASSIGNED HIGH WEIGHT OF 127 IN CHULA VISTA HANDICAP

<P>
Bayakoa, who was scratched once this year because her connections did not like 
the weight assignment, has been assigned high weight of 127 for the $158,000 
Chula Vista Handicap at Del Mar on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
That means the 6-year-old, which was the 1989 Eclipse Award-winning mare, will 
concede from 13 to 17 pounds to her six rivals in the Grade II race for fillies 
and mares ages 3 and up. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine-bred horse was scratched from the $200,000 Vanity Handicap at 
Hollywood Park on July 15 because owner Frank Whitham and trainer Ron McAnally 
did not like the fact that she was assigned four pounds more than a rival who 
had beaten her in an earlier race. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay Jr., who has ridden Bayakoa in most of her races, will be aboard 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa has won four of seven races this year, with a pair of seconds. Two of 
her losses have come when she's taken on colts, most recently in the San Diego 
Handicap here on Aug. 4 when she finished second to Quiet American. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa has won more than $2 million, which is far more than her six rivals 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa ran in the Chula Vista last year, but could not handle a furious speed 
duel and finished well behind Goodbye Halo.

Alex Haley says he may not have become a writer if his parents and grandparents 
had not given him a foot-thick slice from a California redwood as a gift 60 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The tree slice had small white markers illustrating the tree's growth, Haley 
says in the Sept. 2 issue of Parade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that, if I read all I could, whenever I found something notably 
historic, then that could become another marker in my slice of tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on, I read every book I could handle, along with my grandpa's 
newspapers for black people," he said. "Today, I absolutely believe that the 
reading inspired by the tree slice greatly influenced my becoming an author. It 
is also why I like most of all to write about historical subjects."

INDIAN GROUP SLAMS CASTING OF LOU PHILLIPS IN NAVAJO ROLE

A Hollywood watchdog group for American Indians has questioned Robert Redford's 
decision not to cast an Indian actor in the leading role of a Navajo policeman 
in Redford's new film. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Diamond Phillips has been selected to play Jim Chee in a film based on New 
Mexico author Tony Hillerman's novel, "The Dark Wind." Redford plans to begin 
filming on the Navajo and Hopi reservations Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"That's true Hollywood," said Ray Baldwin Louis, a high school drama teacher in 
Crystal, N.M.. "They've been coming out here for years promising to cast 
Navajos in leading roles. But they always end up with an Italian or a 
foreign-born." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Paradise, director of the watchdog group the American Indian Registry 
for the Performing Arts in Hollywood said she will meet with Redford and 
Phillips within the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Redford has bought the (rights to several) books from Mr. Hillerman and 
knowing there are other films down the line that follow the same story line, we 
are concerned," she said. Chee appears in many of Hillerman's mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Paradise said Phillips claims that he is part Indian but has not given the 
registry any documentation as requested. 
</P>
<P>
A publicity packet for "Young Guns II," in which Phillips played a Mexican 
Indian, said he is part Cherokee, Filipino, Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and 
Hispanic. Phillips also played an American Indian in the 1989 movie 
"Renegades." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Actors' Equity voted to bar white actor Jonathan Pryce from 
playing the part of a Eurasian pimp in the U.S. production of "Miss Saigon," 
now on the London stage. But after the producer canceled the production, which 
has the largest advance ticket sales in Broadway history, the union's executive 
council reversed itself. 
</P>
<P>
Sammye Meadows, the Native American liaison for Dark Wind Productions, said 
Phillips was offered the contract two weeks ago. His agent said contract 
negotiations remained incomplete Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have really liked to have a Navajo actor play Jim Chee," Meadows 
said. "We spent enormous amounts of money traveling to powwows. . . . We didn't 
find the actor."

The curtain drops on the summer movie season this weekend with the spectral 
romance of "Ghost" winning the most moviegoers' hearts, surpassing such 
big-budget thrillers as "Total Recall" and "Die Hard 2." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cruise's "Days of Thunder" faded early. The much-hyped "Dick Tracy" failed 
to fire up the box office for long. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Willis' "Die Hard 2" did well, but wasn't tops. And "RoboCop 2" quickly 
ran out of power. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the industry's most prescient prognosticators picked "Ghost" to scare 
up the most business. 
</P>
<P>
A modest supernatural thriller starring Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi 
Goldberg, "Ghost" today should pass Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall" to 
reach the box-office's top spot with more than $115 million at the gate, 
Paramount Pictures says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so far away from what's out there this summer," "Ghost" producer Howard 
W. Koch said. "The audience said, 'No more four-letter words. I don't want to 
see anybody blown up.' It's about time people can be in love with one another 
and not feel embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bruce Corwin, president of Southern California's Metropolitan movie 
theater chain: "This summer had an abundance of action-oriented films and they 
just fought each other. . . . 'Ghost' was huge, a pleasant surprise to 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
In a season loaded with several overblown sequels and richly budgeted action 
films, most performed only moderately well. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's "Days of Thunder," for instance, has made $79 million, just a few 
million more than Cruise's 1988 "Cocktail." The studio's "Another 48 HRS.," 
with Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, grossed $78.7 million. Universal's "Back to 
the Future Part III" made $83.6 million, compared to the $110 million collected 
by "Back to the Future Part II." 
</P>
<P>
As is certain in a season as crowded as this summer, there were a number of 
bombs. They included Jack Nicholson's "The Two Jakes," the Middle East drama 
"Navy SEALs," Bill Cosby in "Ghost Dad" and "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

The first collection of 19th-Century Russian paintings to be exhibited outside 
the Soviet Union will be displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art starting in 
October, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition will forever change our idea of Russia and our idea of 
19th-Century art," said Richard Brettel, museum director. "These are sweeping 
masterpieces, some better than anything done by the American or French 
Impressionists." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will be displayed in Dallas through December and then in 
Omaha, includes 98 paintings culled from several museums across the Soviet 
Union. Gordon Dee Smith, president of a Texas-based nonprofit group called 
Inter Cultura, which fosters international cultural dialogue, said the 
exhibition "will stun art experts."

SUMMER SQUALL IS 'VERY SHARP' FOR $300,000 DERBY

Preakness winner Summer Squall rested this summer and is rated by trainers as 
"very sharp now" for Monday's $300,000 Pennsylvania Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall is the pre-race favorite against 12 3-year-old challengers and is 
eager to add to his $1.3 million earnings with his ninth victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a win," said W. Cothran Campbell, who manages the bay colt for 
a 28-person partnership. "He'll be ready to go a mile and an eighth first time 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the race are Blackhawk's Ghost, Challenge My Duty, Chas' Whim, Dr. 
Bobby A., It's Always You, Mr. Nasty, My Other Brother, Runaway Stream, Senator 
To Be, Sports View, Tees Prospect and Zalipour. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky-bred Summer Squall was shipped here from Saratoga, N.Y., on Monday and 
has been tuning up for the Pennsylvania Derby on Labor Day since then. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse has had the summer off, but he's very sharp now," Campbell said. "He 
has grown some and gained weight. We couldn't be more pleased with the colt. He 
has trained beautifully at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer Squall is an exciting horse to watch, and we're anxious to run him in 
Pennsylvania after being off since mid-May." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Neil Howard also said the horse is ready and eager after overcoming a 
hairline fracture to his cannon bone, which he suffered last year. At one 
point, there was concern that Summer Squall's career was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
This year, after winning the Jim Beam and Blue Grass Stakes, he finished second 
to Unbridled in the Kentucky Derby, running what Howard called "a good race." 
</P>
<P>
"He got a head in front at the quarter pole, but as he turned into the stretch, 
the roar of the Derby crowd started him," Howard said. "He lost his 
concentration, and it took him until the wire to start running again. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Derby he trained like he was on a mission. We couldn't hold him on 
the ground at Pimlico. He was sitting perfect in the Preakness until the 
quarter pole. Then, it got tight at the head of the stretch, and the tighter it 
got the better he liked it."

ZENO PUTS HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When last season ended, UCLA guard Lance Zeno knew that he would be the only 
returning offensive lineman with any appreciable experience. 
</P>
<P>
So he went to Coach Terry Donahue with a proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him if you need me to move to center in the best interest of the team, 
I'll do it," Zeno said. "I knew we had a young line, and the center here has 
always been a team leader. I thought it would help our team the most if I moved 
to center." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue agreed, so the 6-foot-4, 273-pound Zeno, a senior, is the acknowledged 
leader at a position where he has limited experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't pull as much at center as you do at guard," Zeno said, "but the 
hardest part is snapping the ball and then getting out to make a block." 
</P>
<P>
Zeno's leadership was evident last season when he was the only junior named by 
his teammates to represent them as one of the four Bruin captains. 
</P>
<P>
It was Zeno's legacy to play for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Joe, played fullback and linebacker for UCLA from 1960 to '62. His 
uncle, Larry, was UCLA's quarterback from 1962 to '64. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his sister, Lori, was an outstanding Bruin volleyball player and 
competes on the women's pro circuit. 
</P>
<P>
His twin brother, Eric, was a UCLA tight end for a while and is a professional 
volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
And, his grandfather, Joe Zeno Sr., played guard for Holy Cross and later for 
the Washington Redskins from 1942 to '44, during the Sammy Baugh era. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA connection almost became the USC connection, though. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was committed to USC, but when he didn't hear from them, he went to 
UCLA -- and the rest is history," Lance Zeno said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Zeno has maintained a USC tie through former Trojan center Brad 
Leggett, who was drafted by the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
They played together at Fountain Valley High School, and Leggett has monitored 
Zeno's progress as a UCLA center. 
</P>
<P>
"This past spring, he watched me and gave me some tips," Zeno said. "Now he's a 
pro and he knows what the pros are looking for, and passes it on to me. That 
shows our friendship." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA struggled in 1989 with a 3-7-1 record, and to make matters worse, Zeno 
recalls coming to practice near the end of the season feeling listless and 
fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember coming out to practice during our agility drills and feeling so 
tired," Zeno said. "I had no legs. I knew something was wrong, and it got worse 
and worse." 
</P>
<P>
One morning, Zeno awakened with a severe stomachache at his apartment on 
campus. He was barely able to get to the UCLA Medical Center, stopping to rest 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take doctors long to diagnose his condition -- appendicitis, and an 
emergency appendectomy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the Oregon game and I couldn't play against USC, but no matter what, 
I wanted to be at the USC game," Zeno said. "I was one of the captains, and it 
was important to the guys that I be there. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, I felt terrible and I didn't know what it was. Perhaps, I 
thought it was because we tied USC (10-10). 
</P>
<P>
"When I woke up the next morning, I had chills and I was shaking so much that 
the bed was moving." 
</P>
<P>
It was back to the emergency room, where it was determined Zeno had an 
infection. He said he was given antibiotics to clear up his blood. He was also 
told to take it easy and not exert himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I go crazy if I can't train," Zeno said, "and it was four months before I 
could. However, I was fine by spring ball." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zeno was a member of a relatively experienced offensive line. Yet, 
that line has since been identified by Donahue as not performing to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Zeno agreed, saying, "We didn't play as well as we should have. Our whole 
offensive unit didn't perform successfully. You can't single out any one 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Zeno isn't dwelling on last season, but he said the team can learn from it. 
"What happened has made our team closer and more anxious to practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Zeno figures to be in the center of it all, leading by example. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue has closed practices until after the Sept. 8 opening game 
with Oklahoma at the Rose Bowl. . . . Three starting-type players -- flanker 
Scott Miller, outside linebacker Rocen Keeton and tight end Corwin Anthony -- 
are sidelined with injuries. As a result, Donahue is doing some adjusting, 
perhaps changing personnel and defenses.
