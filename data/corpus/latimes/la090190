FEINSTEIN, WILSON CAMPAIGNS FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why don't our two gubernatorial candidates realize that the one who will get 
the winning vote will be the one who expresses concern for California and 
outlines plans and goals to make our state a better place. 
</P>
<P>
For far too long now, both parties have been concentrating their efforts on 
digging up skeletons from their opponent's closet, rather than preparing a 
campaign that will educate the California public on their priorities for the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
I think I can speak for the majority of Californians when I say that I am not 
interested in what candidates do with their personal lives and finances, as 
opposed to what they plan to do with mine. 
</P>
<P>
I urge our two well-qualified candidates to stop running a race on what their 
opponent has done wrong, and to start running the race on what they've done 
right.

ONLY WAY OUT FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Johannesburg City Council held out promise of further progress last week by 
voting to open legally segregated residential areas to all races and ethnic 
groups. Although the local resolution carries no official weight -- only the 
president and national government can desegregate living areas -- the action 
symbolizes the widening acceptance in South Africa that apartheid is dying. 
</P>
<P>
After four hours of rigorous debate, the white City Council, emboldened perhaps 
by the prospect of reform, has called for making the divided nation's biggest 
city and financial center a "free settlement" area, a city without legal 
restrictions on residents. 
</P>
<P>
The progressive resolution specifically calls for a city "in which all people, 
irrespective of race, color or creed, can own property and live in the 
residential areas of their choice." That ideal should be the rule not the 
exception throughout South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Residential segregation is a pillar of apartheid. The Group Areas Act, which 
was passed more than 30 years ago, requires whites, blacks and other racial and 
ethnic groups to live separately in areas designated solely for a single group. 
That law reserves most of the cities for the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
South African President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised the repeal of the 
Group Areas Act in the next session of Parliament, which is scheduled for 
February. What remains unclear, however, is what measures will replace the 
restrictions to protect what De Klerk is calling "community life." Nothing less 
than the total abolition of legal segregation is equitable. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who on Friday called on his National Party to accept all South 
Africans, can also encourage residential change. The national government, with 
the president's approval, can exempt an area from the restrictive law. 
</P>
<P>
Progress is coming to South Africa -- but not smoothly. Steps forward include 
the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the legalizing of the African National 
Congress. Steps backward include the tribal and political fighting that has 
killed so many and the hardening of the pro-apartheid right wing. In that 
charged atmosphere, the Johannesburg City Council offered a timely new step 
forward, a reminder of the ultimate goal.

HOW HOT THE GREENHOUSE?; 
</P>
<P>
A HOT ENOUGH QUESTION TO REQUIRE SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The industrial nations may be approaching a confrontation in which troops, 
bombast or peace negotiations would be of little use. If it comes, the 
confrontation would be with their own planet over matters of physics, chemistry 
and the atmosphere -- items that are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown involves the so-called greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide that 
result from burning fossil fuels to produce energy. Not many scientists any 
longer dismiss out of hand the theory that CO2 and other gases rise to the 
stratosphere to form an envelope around the Earth that holds in warm air that 
otherwise should escape to icy outer space. 
</P>
<P>
One way to deal with the problem is both elementary and the most complicated 
task humans have ever faced: Stop burning so much fossil fuel -- from oil to 
logs. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States, the largest producer of carbon dioxide, is balking at 
rushing into mitigation measures. President Bush was so agitated recently by 
demands from environmentalists to move faster that he blasted the Sierra Club 
and other mainstream groups as extremists. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, American insistence on irrefutable proof of risk before it takes 
the greenhouse problem seriously enough to do something about it is isolating 
the country from other, mostly European, countries. Still, the White House 
argues that there are too many uncertainties to justify spending money to curb 
emissions. It warns that trying to put caps on the gases that any country's 
plants could let escape into the atmosphere could disrupt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent demonstration of the gap occurred in Sweden at a meeting of 
scientists from 75 countries. These were not men with long beards wearing 
grubby robes and carrying signs that said: "Repent. The End Is Near." They are 
students of the Earth's climate and, as Times writer Rudy Abramson reported 
this week, this is generally what they said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thinks the atmosphere will be 
on average 5.4 degrees warmer by the end of the next century, an estimate the 
panel also thinks probably is low. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If humans take no steps to curb the greenhouse gases, oceans could rise 3 
feet by the beginning of the 22nd Century. This could "displace tens of 
millions of people, flood productive land and contaminate fresh water 
supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Against that background, capping emissions is precisely the direction in which 
the United Nations is moving. The U.N. called for the assessment of the risks 
of global warming that were discussed in Sweden. The final report is due in a 
few months, and the tentative timetable calls for negotiating an international 
pact to limit emissions by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the White House has its hands full in the Middle East, but part of 
what that crisis is about -- or should be -- is teaching Americans how to live 
well on less fuel. That is all that the U.N.'s panel of scientists is talking 
about when they urge reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Facing down a 
daylight robber like Iraq's Saddam Hussein is one thing. Facing down the planet 
itself is quite another matter.

The debate over who did what in the S&amp;L debacle is a subordinate issue in

Years of promoting and provoking anti-women, anti-minority, anti-civil rights

CONTROVERSIAL BEHAVIORIST B.F. SKINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' obituary of Skinner (Aug. 20) was remarkably well-done. It provided 
a good sense of the life of this dramatically influential psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
There was neither confusion of the baby tender with the Skinner box nor of 
Palov's classical conditioning with operant conditioning, a distinction that 
eluded a national news magazine and a scientific journal. 
</P>
<P>
It tells us something about ourselves that even such fine journalism is no 
protection against a major distortion of one of Skinner's fundamental beliefs: 
that behavior uncaused by heredity and environment, sometimes called free will, 
is a fuzzy mirage. The article informs us that Skinner "argued to the end . . . 
(that) there is little or no free will." "Argued to the end" is a phrase you'd 
expect to find applied to an earlier century to an atheist who died without the 
expected death-bed recantation. In fact, Skinner explained, as have many before 
him, that so-called free will is a misconception. Therefore, he could not 
believe that people might have just a little of it, except in the sense that 
they might have just a little of the misconception. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner did not propose "forsaking individual freedom . . . in favor of 
controlling human behavior to achieve a world free of war," etc. There is 
nothing to forsake but a muddled concept, which is held to because it is 
confused with a meaningful freedom: the freedom to do what one wishes uncoerced 
by others. A clearer understanding will reduce resistance to needed social 
engineering and also sensitize us to the dangers of being subtly manipulated to 
our disadvantage by those using rewards rather than threats.

MAHONY'S LETTERS TO SHEINKMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write in response to the John Dart/Bob Baker article ("Mahony's Religious 
Suggestion to Jewish Unionist Stirs Anger," Religion, Aug. 25), and to express 
my puzzlement and my dismay. 
</P>
<P>
My exchange of correspondence with Jack Sheinkman (president of the Amalgamated 
Clothing and Textile Workers Union in New York) began in February when I and 
other Catholic leaders across the country wrote to all the members of the 
Executive Council of the AFL-CIO urging them to take a neutral stance on the 
abortion question. These letters had nothing to do with the past cemetery 
workers dispute in the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
I am puzzled why your reporters could not simply state these facts. Rather, 
they attempt to create division between me and Sheinkman, a man whom I respect 
greatly. 
</P>
<P>
I was pleased that the result of these letters from many of us to the AFL-CIO 
actually resulted in the union taking a neutral stance on the abortion matter. 
</P>
<P>
What shocks me is the obvious attempt by your reporters to inject a 
Jewish-Catholic rivalry in this entire matter. In Sheinkman's June 5 response 
to my May 21 letter, he makes absolutely no mention of interpreting that letter 
in the negative fashion described in the article. In two meetings with 
Sheinkman's general counsel later in June, his chief attorney also made no such 
inferences. In fact, it was only then in late June that I learned that 
Sheinkman was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of my letters written during the Easter season (April 15 to June 
3) end with similar Christian expressions of joy and blessing. For a religious 
leader to extend blessings upon others does not reflect a disregard for their 
own religious faith or practices. 
</P>
<P>
But your reporters have inferred a religious rift and apparently concocted this 
story to create a division between the Catholic and Jewish communities. I 
reject their assertion out of hand, and I am offended by their lack of 
knowledge concerning the outstanding relationship which has long existed, and 
continues to exist, between the Catholic community and the Jewish community in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Your reporters cannot seem to state the facts clearly with respect to the past 
dispute between the archdiocese and ACTWU. The second election among our 
employees was held because they did not want anything to do with the union. The 
one-year election agreement had expired. But the purpose of the election was to 
give the employees their voice. And all evidence continues to show that our 
cemetery employees have absolutely no interest in belonging to ACTWU or any 
other union.

"I sing that body electric," proclaimed a youthful Walt Whitman. "That of the 
male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect." Writing his sublimely 
optimistic poem just before the Civil War put everything in doubt, Whitman 
asserted that the great new country of the United States required healthy 
bodies to safeguard its Constitution. The elimination of disease and infirmity 
must be a free people's first obligation, he suggested. And not just white 
bodies; at a slave auction, Whitman sees and celebrates with egalitarian fervor 
black bodies that are "the start of populous states and rich republics." Here, 
we feel, is the true American Dream, this liberation of the body from degrading 
social taboos and from the bigotry of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In this country we like to think that declaring something to be true makes it 
true ("We hold these truths to be self-evident . . ."). Looking back on Whitman 
from our decade, when the care and feeding of a healthy body has become one of 
our most sacred virtues, we credit him with announcing a triumphant new civil 
religion. He inherited the outworn Puritanism that condemned the body as a 
cesspool of sinful appetites and re-imagined it as a glorious temple pure in 
every part. Yes, he deserves credit, but as his choice of metaphor implies, 
technology was on his side. Everything "electric" had a bright future after 
1855. 
</P>
<P>
What Whitman foresaw when he read about the experiments of Volta, Davy, Ampere 
and Faraday was that electromagnetism would become the means for defining what 
human beings essentially were. The processes of sexuality and digestion, the 
brain's creative impulses, the flow of the blood, the amazing maneuverability 
of the skeleton -- all of these and more were to be understood as conductors of 
the dynamic electrical current passing through and animating all natural 
things. The result was a democratic vision of harmony dependent on 
technological progress. When Edison and his followers transformed the world by 
their inventions, they re-invented human nature as well, in ways that we have 
been trying to comprehend since the American Century began. 
</P>
<P>
The body electric was gradually reconceived as a machine, like the automobile 
and the radio. Keeping the human machine in repair became a high value of the 
new society, not just for economic reasons but because the body had become -- 
as Whitman prophesied -- the only version of the soul that most people could 
understand. As the notion of an afterlife receded from view, driven to the 
margins of consciousness by the wonders of science and technology, the 
obsession with repairing bodily dysfunction and forestalling death became one 
of the chief forces in modern culture. 
</P>
<P>
As the clergy of this new religion, physicians became the central figures of 
our secular society. Their miracles have sustained our belief in progress even 
as other fields of technology have brought disillusionment and threats of 
catastrophe. The doctor is so honored because he can keep the machine running; 
and run it does, incessantly. High school students pump themselves up with 
steroids or starve themselves until they resemble the media imagery of robust 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies enforce increasingly tougher health standards which 
frighten some, or many, into neurotic anxiety about looking good and feeling 
better. Carlyle commented that the healthy know nothing of their health; only 
the sick know of their sickness. He was wrong; the healthy in a 
health-conscious society can never stop thinking and talking about their diets 
and exercise regimens. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal encounter of Alzheimer's disease victim Janet Adkins and suicide 
doctor Jack Kevorkian was the inevitable culmination of such a cultural 
mentality. This woman who, a week before her death, had beaten her grown son at 
tennis, who was happy in her marriage, happy in general, could not tolerate the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's. She apparently suffered from the devastating illusion 
that a life not enjoyed with perfect consciousness and perfect physical 
robustness was not a life worth having, not for another minute if she could 
help it. Armed with this dangerous notion of corporal perfection, she located 
an angel of death who could administer the corrective fix. 
</P>
<P>
Medical students learn very early the classical myth of Asclepius, the god of 
healing, who was killed by Zeus because he could bring the dead back to life. 
Death is God's province, not man's, is the point of this myth. But what of the 
inverted form of the story, as Dr. Kevorkian embodies it? Should a doctor 
succumb to his patient's arbitrary misgivings about the body's weakening 
current of life? "The preserver of life has often been exempted from normal 
limits of behavior," notes Dr. Willard Gaylin. "Whether he is called priest or 
physician . . . both have literally gotten away with murder." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Janet Adkins' death is murder or suicide will be decided in the proper 
forum, but her recourse to the good doctor's "suicide machine" must be seen as 
the result of a social pathology that defines the body electric too narrowly, 
too exclusively. The relentless biological fate that overtakes us all has 
always seemed terrible, but people who have made the adjustment to waning power 
and increasing pain have sustained happiness in ways that need to be publicized 
widely and continuously. If the National Endowment for the Arts is looking for 
uplifting art to subsidize, it could do worse than to broadcast the 
affirmations of those whose experiences stand apposed to Janet Adkins and Dr. 
Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we should remove the Olympic champions and movie stars from posters for 
a while, and put there Whitman's inspiring poems of old age. "The body wreck'd, 
old, poor and paralyzed . . . The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not 
yet extinct, The undiminish'd faith," he wrote, and later, "Thanks in old age . 
. . for the midday sun, the impalpable air -- for life, mere life."

DODGERS MISS A CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CINCINNATI LOSES, BUT MONTREAL HELPS THE REDS BY BEATING LOS ANGELES, 
5-2.

<P>
The Dodgers' hopes Friday night revolved around the number 4 1/2, but there was 
nothing magical about it. 
</P>
<P>
They entered the night with a chance to move to within 4 1/2 games of the 
National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds, who had lost to the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers lost to the Montreal Expos, partially because of a ground ball 
that bounced off the chest of a second baseman who later said he is glad there 
are only 4 1/2 weeks left in his miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was 5-2, the second baseman was Juan Samuel and the Dodgers 
could kick themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"To have the Reds already lose, that made this that much tougher for us -- this 
would have been a big win," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the sixth time since the All-Star break that the Dodgers did not 
take advantage of a Reds' loss with a game-gaining victory. Each wasted chance 
is magnified because, as Juan Samuel can now tell you, the Dodgers have only 31 
games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we have left in this season?" asked a weary Samuel, who will probably 
leave the Dodgers as a free agent this winter. 
</P>
<P>
When informed, he sighed in resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I've only got 4 1/2 weeks left to deal with this stuff," he said. "All I 
can do now is take it one day at a time, one day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his obvious effort and intensity, Samuel will leave the Dodgers with 
memories like those of Friday's fourth inning, when Delino DeShields bounced a 
ball off him for a two-out, two-run single that gave the Expos the lead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan, the Dodger starter who was given a 1-0 lead after a wild first 
inning by Expo rookie pitcher Chris Nabholz, started the Expos' fourth-inning 
attack by issuing a one-out walk to rookie Jerry Goff. Spike Owen singled and 
Nabholz advanced the runners with a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Then DeShields knocked a hard shot barely to the right of second base. Samuel 
took one step and attempted to backhand it, but the ball bounced up and hit him 
in the chest, ricocheting into shallow center field. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan suddenly trailed, 2-1, and was headed for his sixth consecutive winless 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get guys to hit the ball right at guys, in the long run, you should 
come out ahead," said Morgan, who fell to 10-12 despite a 3.35 earned-run 
average. "If I get ground balls and the plays aren't made, there is nothing I 
can do about it. I mean, I just throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Samuel: "I knew I would have a hard time with the ball as soon as he 
hit it. I don't think I have a shot at nobody even if I do catch it. It was 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Before 14,514 at Olympic Stadium, the Expos added two runs in the seventh 
inning against Morgan and reliever Dave Walsh. That offset a Dodger run in an 
eighth inning, which ended when a bases-loaded fly ball by Rick Dempsey fell 
short of the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
DeShields, a leading candidate for National League rookie of the year, added 
his third homer in the eighth inning against Don Aase. It ensured a third 
victory for Nabholz, who allowed one hit in seven innings; and a seventh save 
for Steve Frey, who finished with a 1 2/3 hitless innings. The Dodgers had only 
just three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel was also part of the offensive story, going hitless in four at-bats to 
lower his latest slump to two hits in 27 at-bats while dropping his average to 
.214, which would be the lowest of his career by 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
This is the reason he is now playing only against left-handers. And that was 
one reason he was able to find some humor in Friday's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired -- I played two days in a row," Samuel said with a smile, later 
adding, "I am not going to complain about the lineup. That is not an excuse. I 
just keep trying and, who knows, I get lucky I get a couple of hits. And if 
not. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Finally admitting to being unlucky was Morgan, who winless streak has made him 
0-for-August. He has not won since a two-hit victory over Cincinnati July 30. 
</P>
<P>
His earned-run average during these six starts has dropped from 3.47 to 3.35, 
but it has done the Dodgers little good. He has been supported with just 2.2 
runs per game during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to feel unlucky -- I've got my health and a good contract and all 
of that -- but I guess pitching-wise, I have been unlucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also his own worst enemy Friday, allowing a season-high 11 hits. He 
remained in the game for six innings only because the Expos stranded seven 
runners in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' other worst enemy was fatigue. They appeared tired and sluggish 
after not arriving in their Montreal hotel Friday following a flight from 
Philadelphia until 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think we were tired, you could just tell," said Lasorda, who had only 
three hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels missed his third consecutive start with a pulled muscle in his 
back. The Dodgers hope he can return today against right-hander Oil Can Boyd 
and break out of his 0-for-13 slump. . . . Boyd will be making his first start 
against the Dodgers today. 
</P>
<P>
While the Reds were acquiring second baseman Bill Doran from Houston just 
before to the deadline for postseason eligibility, the Dodgers were standing 
pat. As promised, Dodger Vice President Fred Claire has decided to challenge 
the Reds with his current lineup. "Some of these trades are a matter of teams 
adding depth -- but our depth has played a key role in our success, when you 
look at the (Chris) Gwynns and (Jose) Gonzalezes," Claire said. The biggest 
reason the Dodgers did not make a deal is the effectiveness of Jim Neidlinger 
and Mike Hartley. Since they joined the rotation beginning with Neidlinger's 
recall from triple-A Albuquerque July 30, they have combined to go 5-1 in nine 
starts.

They hung a bra on the Mountaineer statue at the University of West Virginia 
this week. They made buttons and bumper stickers saying: "We don't want a 
Mountaindear. Give us back our Mountaineer." 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Tennant won a "cheer-off" last spring and was named West Virginia's 
first female mascot. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant will make her debut today when West Virginia opens its football season 
at home against Kent State. 
</P>
<P>
She told the Associated Press that she expects to be booed. After she won the 
cheer-off, she said, students began chanting: "Go back to the kitchen!" 
</P>
<P>
Said Tennant: "They didn't know that I can't cook." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who is the only major league player to hit a home run in each of 
the first four games of a season? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Science: At 74, Jerry Barber, golf pro at Griffith Park, is the oldest 
regular player on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent tournament, Barber approached the green after hitting a good 
approach shot. When the applause faded, he turned to the gallery and said, 
"That shot comes from 50 years of research." 
</P>
<P>
Back door blues: England's Peter Elliott reached today's final of the 
1,500-meter run in the European Track and Field Championships at Split, 
Yugoslavia, by way of a jury decision. Officials ruled that Elliott's fall 600 
meters from the finish of his semifinal heat Thursday was caused by East 
Germany's Hauke Fuhlbruegge, who was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands, who 
among them have seven finalists, filed a joint protest, asking for Elliott's 
removal, citing a rule that requires a finalist to finish the semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott told John Rodda of the Guardian: "In my heart of hearts, I don't really 
think it is right that I'm in the race. I didn't run right through to the 
finishing post." 
</P>
<P>
Add Elliott: His left arm, strained in the fall, is heavily bandaged down to 
his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
He told Rodda: "The problem is I can't do up my shoelaces, but Crammie 
(England's Steve Cram) has promised to tie them for me when we get on the 
track." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Rodda: "Separately, one hopes." 
</P>
<P>
Brain trust: In the closing seconds of Tulane's football game against Memphis 
State in 1989, Tulane Coach Greg Davis told quarterback Deron Smith to call the 
next play at the line of scrimmage -- either a pass against an eight-man front 
or a run against a seven-man front. 
</P>
<P>
Smith threw a touchdown pass for a 38-34 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Davis recently recalled his conversation with Smith after the quarterback came 
off the field: 
</P>
<P>
"How many down linemen did they have?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Three," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"How many outside linebackers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Two." 
</P>
<P>
"How many inside linebackers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Two." 
</P>
<P>
"Deron, that's seven," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're right, coach," Smith said. "If I was as smart as you, we'd have lost 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Feat of Clay?: Cleveland Brown linebacker Clay Matthews, who ended his 
five-week holdout Thursday and will report to practice Monday, was unconcerned 
when asked whether he would be ready for the Browns' season opener against 
Pittsburgh Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Said Matthews: "Anybody can play with five warm-up games. It takes a man to 
play in one week." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants, April 6, 7, 8 and 10, 
1971.

MELVIN DURSLAG: THEY HAVE FANS UNDER THE GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who follow the adventures of Nolan Ryan these days appear to be puzzled 
by the speed of his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the onfusion eased by television, which enlists the help of the radar 
gun to measure the velocity of Nolan's hummers, now dispensed by an arm that is 
43. 
</P>
<P>
An arm that is 43 is not to be dismantled and sold for parts. But it isn't 
supposed to cause trouble, either, getting folks quarreling over whether the 
pitches it turns loose are traveling 90, 93, 95 or even 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Society would be relieved of a major burden today if speed guns had not been 
invented. Jim Palmer, your friendly neighborhood Hall of Famer, never has 
trusted the gun, pointing out that Pennsylvania highway police using the 
instrument one day got no reading on a motorist but clocked a tree going 85. 
</P>
<P>
Then a discrepancy exists between the two principal speed guns employed in 
baseball, one brand measuring pitches at roughly 4 m.p.h. faster than the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
And some scouts will submit that low pitches register faster on the gun than 
high pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan wishes that arguments over the speed of his pitches would desist. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean anything, because how fast you throw the ball isn't as 
important as where you throw it," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show, besides, that Ryan today is throwing only 60% fastballs. He 
goes to the curve 25% of the time and to the changeup 15%. 
</P>
<P>
If Ryan never took speed guns seriously as a rosy-jawed lad, he isn't taking 
them seriously at 43. With a knowing smile, he has allowed a promotional circus 
to be built around his speed for years. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1974, when Ryan served the Angels, a marketing genius came up with the 
idea of offering a trip to Hawaii to the fan coming closest to predicting how 
fast he would throw the ball in a game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
To give substance to this cerebral explosion, the Angels invited a team of four 
scientists from Rockwell International to deploy a new infrared radar device 
used previously for determining the speed of missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up this instrument, the scientists went to work. They clocked Ryan's 
fastball at 100.9 m.p.h. -- and it was aloha for a customer hitting that figure 
on the button. 
</P>
<P>
It was explained that the same equipment could measure the speed of a 
baserunner, but, blessedly, it hasn't been called upon for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, you might be hearing on TV, "On that last steal, Vince Coleman 
reached a maximum speed of 28 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Do speed guns serve any useful purpose, or, producing more numbers, do they 
clutter further the minds of viewers? 
</P>
<P>
"The guns are probably most useful in the scouting of young talent," says Ben 
Wade, director of scouting for the Dodgers. "Speed is the basic item for 
beginning your assessment. You put a gun on a kid. If it it measures, say, 90, 
you know this is someone worth your attention. 
</P>
<P>
"But clocking speed also is dangerous because, finding someone who lacks it, 
you could walk away from a good pitcher. We have a fine prospect named Jim 
Neidlinger. He throws only 85. But he has finesse, which is just as important 
as speed." 
</P>
<P>
Once a giant of the bullpen, a big velocity man, Goose Gossage contended that 
speed guns made his job easier. 
</P>
<P>
"Batters hear about these gun ratings," Gossage said. "They psych out. They 
grow tense at the plate, worried whether they will be able to get around on the 
pitch. If I were a hitter, I would step into the box pretending no one throws 
faster than 82." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of the batter increases when word reaches him that the pitcher's 
fastball rises, as it is supposed to do for such as Ryan, Roger Clemens and Rob 
Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
Many scholars will debate you on the issue of the rising fastball, claiming 
that it is an optical illusion. The eye is so trained to seeing pitches that 
drop that when they maintain their plane, they give the impression of rising, 
goes that argument. 
</P>
<P>
It reminds you of the testimony offered by Yogi Berra on a tape-measure homer 
by Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
"When that ball hit the third tier 400 feet away, it was still rising!" Yogi 
exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Well, an object following a reasonably parabolic course must travel as great a 
distance on the fall as it does on the rise, meaning that Mantle, to Berra's 
discerning eye, had an 800-foot jewel in the works.

CRITICISM OF PUBLISHER BY KAHN IS CRITICIZED BY BOOK PUBLISHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was astonished that the Los Angeles Times published and syndicated, without 
any attempt to obtain verification from me, an article as distorted as the one 
written by Roger Kahn about his experience writing Pete Rose's biography. At 
the very least, I'd like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
I am not the greedy monster Roger Kahn portrays me as being. Roger and Pete 
Rose had until spring, 1987, to finish the book (on Rose), but when Roger's son 
died and he asked me for additional time, I most definitely agreed to give it 
to him. Roger and I agreed on a delay of several months; I did NOT respond by 
starting a lawsuit as Roger indicates. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Roger still hadn't finished the Pete Rose book by the end of 1987 
(far past the new deadline), my company did begin to balk. After all, Roger and 
Pete had made a commitment to give us this book, and they had accepted $225,000 
for it. It did not seem unreasonable to expect them to honor the commitment, 
but it turned out that we had to hire lawyers to get the point across. Roger 
said he settled the suit at a "great loss." Well, he fails to mention that we 
agreed to accept repayment of far less than the amount Roger and Pete had 
received from us, so who suffered a greater loss? 
</P>
<P>
Roger curiously complains that the press was misled, but I think if anyone was 
misled, it was Warner (Books, Inc.) in expecting to receive a finished book 
from Roger for the money it paid. Roger says, "The book for Warner never 
worked. Books that begin with naked hype never do." Roger forgets to mention 
that the sole reason it didn't work was that he wrote only a small portion of 
the biography -- barely past Pete's high school days. Roger admits that when 
"the publisher was gone," he sat down with Pete to complete the book. By then, 
he found another publisher willing to gamble that he and Pete would finish the 
book.

TROJANS SEND MESSAGE BY REINSTATING PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news of the assault on a woman graduate student at USC was indeed shocking 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
However, I was outraged when I read that the students (allegedly) involved 
continue to practice with the football team. 
</P>
<P>
I am well aware that the legal aspects of this case have yet to be resolved. It 
seems to me that the issue here is not one of legality but of morality. 
</P>
<P>
The message sent by allowing these students continued participation in the USC 
athletic program is clear: violence and sexual abuse of women is permitted at 
USC.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
RIVERA JOINS GROWING CAST OF RED SOX STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a month ago, the Boston Red Sox were struggling. Except for Roger 
Clemens, they didn't seem to have much pitching. They had lost bullpen ace Jeff 
Reardon for the season. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have much power, either. They had to scratch for runs and they were 
battling to stay close in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
But as the season heads into its final month, the Red Sox are the one team that 
seems to have everything. 
</P>
<P>
Backup shortstop Luis Rivera, who hit only five home runs in his first 268 
at-bats, hit his second in two games Friday night at Boston. It was a grand 
slam, the first for Boston this season, and it carried the Red Sox to 7-3 
victory over the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Red Sox's eighth in a row. Winner Greg Harris (12-5) is 
merely one of a number of pitchers who have taken some of the pressure off 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Harris gave up two hits in eight innings before tiring in the ninth. He wound 
up with a 4-1 record in August. 
</P>
<P>
Both Harris, who has thrived as a starter after a long career in the bullpen, 
and Rivera were merely hoping to make the club in the spring. Now they are key 
players in the pennant drive. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera's grand slam on a 2-and-0 pitch broke open a tight game in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the best feeling I've had in all my career," said Rivera, a 
26-year-old utility infielder. "When I hit the ball I didn't think it was a 
home run. I thought it was a long fly that would bring in a run. It's a very 
exciting time." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, who has been subbing for the injured Jody Reed, is six for 12, has 
scored five runs, hit two home runs and driven in eight runs in his last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, Texas 2 -- Willie McGee went 0 for 4 in his debut for the Athletics 
at Oakland, but still made a big contribution. 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat in the American League, McGee, who left St. Louis as the 
No. 2 hitter in the National League, drove in a run with an infield out. 
</P>
<P>
His speed accounted for another run in the eighth. He reached first on a 
fielder's choice. Pitcher Kenny Rogers made a wild pickoff attempt and when the 
ball sailed down the right field line, McGee scored. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Welch gave up one earned run in 7 1/3 innings to improve to 22-5. 
</P>
<P>
After left-hander Rick Honeycutt retired the last two batters on three pitches 
in the eighth, Dennis Eckersley retired the Rangers in the ninth for his 40th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 12, Cleveland 8 -- Rookie Luis Sojo had to take over at shortstop for 
the Blue Jays when Tony Fernandez developed a shoulder problem. 
</P>
<P>
Sojo made three errors in the game at Cleveland, but he drove in five runs with 
his first home run and a double. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays remained 6 1/2 games behind the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians took a 4-0 lead and Sojo's first two errors contributed to runs. 
</P>
<P>
Sojo's two-run double helped the Blue Jays pull even in the fifth and his 
three-run homer highlighted a six-run sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 12, Minnesota 6 -- There were 13 extra-base hits in this game at 
Minneapolis, with the Tigers building a 9-1 lead in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cecil Fielder didn't get one of the four home runs, the home run 
leader hit one of three triples, driving in two runs, and now has 111 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Whitaker and Lloyd Moseby hit home runs for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Baltimore 1 -- Ron Robinson (8-3) pitched an eight-hitter at 
Milwaukee for his third complete game in his last six starts. In those six 
starts, he is 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Brock drove in two runs for the Brewers with a sacrifice fly and his sixth 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who have won only three of their last 11, trail Boston in the East 
by 13 1/2 games. DAN HAFNER

Going into the ninth inning Friday night, it appeared the Pittsburgh Pirates 
would expand their lead in the National League East to 2 1/2 games.

Mets at New York, 3-1.

But when the evening was over, the Mets had moved to within half a game of 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the Mets have disappointed their fans, who expected them to 
win the East handily. 
</P>
<P>
There has been one phase of their game that has definitely lived up to 
expectations -- their ability to pull out games in their last at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the ninth inning at New York, veteran Don Robinson appeared to 
be toying with the Mets. He had a six-hitter and had thrown only 87 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Magadan singled and Gregg Jefferies doubled him home. Manager Roger 
Craig brought in Steve Bedrosian. It was decided to give an intentional walk to 
Darryl Strawberry, putting the potential winning run on base. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds foiled the strategy with a single up the middle, tying the 
score and sending Strawberry to third. Howard Johnson dropped a pop fly barely 
inside the right-field line and the Mets had their fourth consecutive victory, 
4-3. It was the 17th time the Mets won in their last chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, about to fall out of the race in the West, built their lead on home 
runs by Matt Williams (his 27th) and Kevin Mitchell (31st). 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- It was an almost identical situation at Houston as 
the Pirates replaced Zane Smith, who had a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Belinda retired the first two Astros. There followed five consecutive 
hits, two against Belinda, two more against Bob Patterson (8-5) and the 
game-winning single by Glenn Wilson off Bill Landrum. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Biggio kept the Astros' hopes alive with a single. He scored on Casey 
Candaele's pinch-double. Franklin Stubbs and Dave Rhode then singled to set the 
stage for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Although he missed a shot at his fourth consecutive victory since joining the 
Pirates, Smith continued his mastery over the Astros. He is 2-0 with an 
earned-run average of 0.82 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Cincinnati 3 -- The last of the ninth was a big one in Chicago, too. 
Paul O'Neill had given the Reds a 3-2 lead with a two-run homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
But the Reds' right fielder lost Andre Dawson's flyball in the sun and it went 
for a double to open the Cubs' ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Three singles later, the Cubs had the victory, with Luis Salazar and Joe 
Girardi hitting run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how tough it is out there," said Dawson, the Cubs' right fielder. "It's 
tougher in center around one, but at this time, the problem's in right." 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Neill: "All I could do was stick my glove out and hope the ball sticks 
in it. I saw the ball at the start, but it was hooking. I feel worse than 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers losing, the Reds remained 5 1/2 games in front in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Randy Myers have a rare poor outing, but the Reds wasted a fine 
effort by Norm Charlton. The left-hander gave up two hits in six innings but 
was deprived of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Already hurting for pitching, the Reds put Jack Armstrong, a 12-game winner, on 
the disabled list because of a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, St. Louis 1 -- John Smoltz (12-9) gave up seven hits in 8 1/3 
innings at Atlanta for his third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon (7-14) gave up only three hits, but lost for the eighth time in 
nine decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, San Diego 2 -- John Kruk hit a two-run double in the eighth 
inning at Philadelphia to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Murphy had a double to extend his hitting streak for the Phillies to 10 
games. DAN HAFNER

A HEAVIER CHAVEZ-TAYLOR REMATCH BEING DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations are under way for another Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor bout, 
at 144 pounds, possibly as soon as November or December. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's New Jersey promotion team, the Duva family, has apparently convinced 
Chavez's camp and HBO that Taylor can no longer make 140 pounds. Under 
discussion is a non-title fight for which both boxers would make several 
million dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and Taylor fought for two 140-pound titles at the Las Vegas Hilton March 
17. It was a classic, one that will be remembered as much for the referee's 
performance as for the fighters'. 
</P>
<P>
With Taylor well ahead on points but fading badly in the 12th and final round, 
Richard Steele stopped the fight with two seconds left, giving Chavez the 
victory after Taylor wouldn't or couldn't respond to his "Are you OK?" query 
after a knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor had great difficulty making 140 for that one, and it's said that he goes 
up to 180 between fights. 
</P>
<P>
If Taylor-Chavez II doesn't come off, Taylor probably will go on to fight new 
welterweight champion Aaron Davis. Chavez, who was to fight lightly regarded 
South Korean Ahn Kyung-Duk on the undercard of the postponed Mike Tyson-Alex 
Stewart fight Sept. 22, probably would move on to a rich junior-welterweight 
fight with Hector Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
There is a major unknown factor in the Chavez-Taylor talks: Tyson. HBO and Don 
King are still talking about a renewal of Tyson's HBO deal, which was to expire 
with the Stewart fight. If Tyson and HBO renew their deal -- talks have been 
going on for nearly a year -- it might complicate Chavez-Taylor II. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new Tyson-HBO deal is said to be for 10 fights over four years. 
The present contract, signed shortly before the 1988 Larry Holmes-Tyson fight, 
is for $26.5 million for seven fights. This one would be for considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
The hang-up in the talks is said to be escape clauses both sides are insisting 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Banke, the super-bantamweight champion from Quail Valley who survived a 
brutal first defense of his World Boxing Council title against Lee Seung-Hoon 
Aug. 18 in South Korea, looked like a mugging victim afterward. His right eye 
was completely closed, he had a cut lip and a deep brow cut. 
</P>
<P>
No way, Banke's manager, Bob Richardson figured, could he keep a September date 
at the Forum against nemesis Daniel Zaragoza. And when Banke told Richardson on 
the flight home from Seoul: "I'm beat, Bob -- I want to take some time off," 
that clinched it. Postponement. 
</P>
<P>
But Banke loves tough fights. Prefers them, in fact, over vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"Five days after he told me he wanted a couple of months off, he came up to me 
and said: 'I'm fine. I want to fight Zaragoza in September after all.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Forum's September date was gone by then but the fight has been rescheduled 
for Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn will get about $650,000 for his match in Paris Oct. 18 against 
Donald Curry, which means his purses have dropped below $1 million for the 
first time in four fights. Curry lately has been portrayed as a desperate 
fighter, teetering on the edge of a sliding career. There's a grain of truth to 
that, but what about Nunn? 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guy who's 35-0, a middleweight champion who should be at or near Sugar 
Ray Leonard-class purses. Instead, his marketability is slipping. Nevada 
Athletic Commission figures show that when Nunn was booed for his lack of 
intensity in his easy decision victory over Marlon Starling at the Mirage in 
March, about half the tickets were giveaways. If he showboats his way to 
another uninteresting decision against Curry, Nunn's next defense could be at 
the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of ticket giveaways, turns out there was a lot of paper in that 
Aug. 11 announced crowd of 5,000-plus at Caesars Tahoe. Actual paid attendance, 
according to the Nevada commission, was 2,520. . . . Junior Olympic 
championships and open division semifinals begin at 7 tonight and open 
championships will be at 1 p.m. Sunday at the National Blue &amp; Gold 
Invitational Boxing Tournament at the Baldwin Park Community Center. . . . 
Promoter Don Chargin says the ticket sale count exceeds 9,000 for his Tony 
Lopez-Jorge Paez bout Sept. 22 in Sacramento and that he's hoping for a crowd 
of 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Feuds: Forum boxing staffers are upset with Mexican promoter Rafael Mendoza 
because they can't find him. The Forum wanted his light-flyweight champion, 
Humberto Gonzalez, to fight on the undercard of the Sept. 22 Sacramento Tony 
Lopez-Jorge Paez bout. Mendoza was nowhere to be found. Another Gonzalez 
aide-de-camp told the Forum that Gonzalez couldn't make it because "Humberto 
has to attend a wedding that day." Attend a wedding? And this is a guy who 
wants to be better known to U.S. audiences? 
</P>
<P>
John Jackson says the Forum pays about $250,000 a year for state-required 
neurological exams for boxers and suggests that managers and the fighters 
should pay for the $75 tests, not promoters. . . . The California Athletic 
Commission is in a six-month trial program to reduce the frequency of boxing 
draws by telling judges not to score even rounds. None did during the Country 
Club card in Reseda Tuesday, but there were two four-round draws on the 
undercard anyway. Simple solution: Make them five-round bouts. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Southland fight manager Nori Takatani has a good one in 
super-featherweight Genaro Hernandez, who improved to 20-0 at the Forum Monday. 
Problem is, despite his high rankings -- second in the WBA and third in the WBC 
-- champions of both organizations are booked for the next several months and 
it will be another six months before a title opportunity comes his way. The 
tall, well-schooled Hernandez will fight either Ben Lopez or Tyrone Jackson at 
the Forum on Sept. 24. Hernandez is the younger brother of former 
junior-welterweight Rudy Hernandez, who won the Forum's first boxing tournament 
in 1983.

NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP;

<P>
ANDRE WARE GETS RUDE WELCOME TO PRO FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware's professional debut, but Bob Gagliano 
stole the spotlight, throwing for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Detroit 
Lions (4-0) beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 26-24, at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals (1-3) led, 24-10, late in the third quarter after Boomer Esiason 
threw his second touchdown pass, this set up by Ware's first pro interception. 
</P>
<P>
After Ware -- who signed Monday and made his debut in the second half -- was 
ineffective in his two series, completing two of seven for 15 yards, Gagliano 
relieved and completed eight of 10 passes for 129 yards to give the Lions their 
first unbeaten preseason since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Campbell, a three-yarder to 
Willie Green, then hit Campbell with a 26-yarder to set up Wilson Hoyle's 
winning 19-yard field goal with 3:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions opened the game with incumbent starting quarterback Rodney Peete, the 
man on the spot with Ware's signing. He had an erratic first half, completing 
13 of 24 with one interception and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 30, San Francisco 10 -- Derrick Fenner ran for two touchdowns and the 
Seahawks took advantage of San Francisco turnovers for their fourth consecutive 
exhibition victory. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (4-1) converted a Steve Young interception and a Roger Craig fumble 
into Fenner's two touchdowns in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (1-3) struggled, playing without quarterback Joe Montana, who sat out 
the team's final exhibition game because of a deep bruise on his right forearm, 
an injury he suffered in a game against San Diego last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 45, New England 14 -- At Foxboro, Mass., Chris Miller and Hugh Millen 
each passed for two touchdowns, the defense ran back two second-half fumbles 
and the Falcons (4-0) completed their first unbeaten exhibition season over New 
England (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 27, Green Bay 14 -- Derrick Thomas, Chris Martin and Leonard 
Griffin scored second-quarter touchdowns off Anthony Dilweg's turnovers at 
Kansas City, as the Chiefs (1-3) beat the Packers (1-3) and their shellshocked 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 20, Miami 17 -- Wade Wilson threw two early touchdown passes, and the 
Vikings (3-1) won at Miami by repeatedly turning back Dolphin scoring threats 
in the final preseason game for both teams. Miami finished 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans 17, Indianapolis 14 -- At New Orleans, the Saints scored all 17 
points off turnovers. Dalton Hilliard and Gill Fennerty both ran for touchdowns 
as Indianapolis ended the exhibition season 0-4. The Saints were 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 25, Phoenix 14 -- Bobby Humphrey ran for two first-quarter touchdowns, 
leading the Broncos (3-2) at home in an exhibition finale interrupted for 26 
minutes by lightning. Phoenix fininished 0-4.

DUFFY HALTS SHERIFF CANDIDATES' VISITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy, responding to what he says are 
"appearances of political pressure or solicitation" by sheriff's candidates 
Jack Drown and Jim Roache, has banned both men from "pop-in" visits to areas of 
the department in which they don't normally work. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sent a warning letter to both men, Duffy said in an interview 
Friday that he had received complaints only about Roache. About half a dozen 
people complained to him directly, Duffy said, and several other protests came 
through the Deputy Sheriff's Assn., the organized law enforcement group to 
which most deputies and officers belong. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have directed my letter just to Roache," Duffy said. "He was bothering 
deputies on duty on his day off. He had no reason to be where he was. That's 
against county regulations. There's no reason for those men on duty to know Jim 
Roache." 
</P>
<P>
Drown, an assistant sheriff, has been on leave since late July and Roache, a 
sheriff's captain, goes on leave next week. Both won't return before November's 
election. Therefore, Duffy said, neither man should have any reason to show up 
to any jail, department or substation unless it's where they work. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has vocally supported Drown in the race. During the June primary, 
however, Roache gathered 32% of the vote and Drown 28%. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Duffy said he objects to any surprise visits that don't have to 
do with a candidate's job duties. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am prohibiting is on-duty or off-duty 'pop-in' visits at sheriff's 
facilities where employees can even perceive that the purpose of such a visit 
is in connection with your political campaign," the Aug. 28 letter says. "Your 
campaigns should be no more of a daily distraction to our employees than is 
already necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said Friday he has appeared at three jail locations in the past two 
months, including a visit to the County Jail downtown three Saturdays ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was downtown anyway and had an hour to kill, so I went in and said hello," 
he said. "I was not campaigning. I have to be conversant on the jail situation 
during the campaign, so that's why I'm making visits. It's not to get votes." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he does not object to Duffy's letter, which has been posted in many 
department locations, but had hoped to visit a new jail location in Otay Mesa. 
He said he probably would ask for a tour. 
</P>
<P>
Since he announced himself a candidate, Roache said he has been "cut out of the 
official loop" of correspondence that others see on the jail situation. "I'm a 
member of this department, and the jails are a crucial issue," he said. "How am 
I supposed to know what's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy said he will see to it that Roache and Drown are cut off from outside 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both on leave," he said. "Neither has business in any facility." 
</P>
<P>
Drown agrees. He said he has not visited any area of the department except his 
office three or four times. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Drown said, he already has nearly everyone's support in the Sheriff's 
Department and does not need to campaign there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to go out there and shake hands," he said. "But Jim's been 
showing up at places where he hasn't been seen in years." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Drown released a survey of 474 members of the Deputy 
Sheriff's Assn. that showed 414 votes for Drown and 11 for Roache. The 
remaining votes were split among other candidates at the time or had no 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said in the letter that he is distributing copies of the letter to a 
number of Sheriff's Department locations. 
</P>
<P>
The department has not had to grapple with the issue of two department 
employees running against each other since 1970, when Duffy, then the captain 
of the County Jail downtown, defeated Chief Deputy Sheriff Warren Kanagy to 
replace a retiring sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has retained his office for 20 years, a period in which it was illegal 
for any staff members to run against an incumbent sheriff. Roache won a court 
battle earlier this year that overturned that policy.

PANEL REJECTS ALL 3 CHOICES FOR COUNTY LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
GARBAGE: FEARS OF CONTAMINATING UNDERGROUND WATER PROMPT THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION TO DISMISS THE NORTH COUNTY AREAS RECOMMENDED BY COUNTY'S STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major setback to a five-year effort to develop new landfills for North 
County, the San Diego County Planning Commission on Friday summarily rejected 
all three sites proposed by the county staff. 
</P>
<P>
Although commissioners voiced specific objections to each of the three 
nominated sites -- one in Fallbrook, one in the Pauma Valley and the third near 
Warner Springs -- they said they were most concerned that all three sites might 
eventually contaminate underground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live in a trash pile with water, but I can't live without water," 
commission chairwoman Lynn Leichtfuss said of her concern that the landfills 
might eventually leak toxics into the ground water. "I won't be pressured just 
because we're running out of trash space." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the county's Department of Public Works, some of whom have been 
searching for a new landfill site in North County since 1985, warned the 
Planning Commission that all of the county's existing landfills will be full in 
10 years, and that, even after a new site is adopted by the county, it might 
take a decade to make it operational. 
</P>
<P>
But, by a series of 4-0 votes, the commissioners said they wanted nothing to do 
with any of the three sites that had been recommended by the staff. The sites 
were whittled down from an original list of 168 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like deciding whether you'd prefer to get mugged by Frankenstein, 
Godzilla, Werewolf or Dracula," Commissioner Richard Wright said in discussing 
the liabilities of each of the three sites. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also rejected the county's own Environmental Impact Report, 
which examined the pros and cons of each site, as inadequate and unacceptable. 
A parade of speakers, some with professional backgrounds, harshly criticized 
the EIR for its flaws and shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission's recommendation that all three sites be rejected will 
now go to the County Board of Supervisors, which will make the final decision. 
It is tentatively scheduled to take up the matter Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The commission did not give direction to the staff to begin considering 
alternative sites, although there was general discussion among them that sites 
along Interstate 15 closer to Escondido should be given greater consideration 
because of their proximity to greater population centers that generate the bulk 
of the garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Unsaid among the commissioners, but recommended by various speakers who 
addressed the commission on Friday, was a previously rejected site known as 
Merriam Mountain, just west of I-15 near the Lawrence Welk Resort and the 
adjoining Champagne Village mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
The stage is now set for the Board of Supervisors, which is hard pressed to 
find a landfill site in North County, to either reject the Planning 
Commission's recommendations and adopt one, two or all three of the proposed 
sites anyway, or to order the county staff to resume the search and brace for a 
debate over an all-new site. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of all three sites said they were delighted by the commission's votes 
but expressed concern that they still had to do final battle with the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the sites, two planning commissioners said they felt uneasy that 
one of the sites -- Gregory Canyon, alongside California 76 in the Pauma 
Valley, just east of I-15 -- is already owned by a partnership of two local 
landowners and Waste Management of California, a subsidiary of Waste Management 
Inc., which promotes itself as the world's largest and most experienced company 
specializing in urban waste-management problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company bought a share of the Gregory Canyon site last year with the hope 
of having it selected by the county, then winning permission from the Board of 
Supervisors to privately operate it. All landfills in the county are now owned 
by the county, which maintains control of the landfills but subcontracts for 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not in the public's interest to have a dump site privately owned and 
operated," said Commissioner Richard Wright. "I feel very uneasy with that." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Clarence P. Wilson said he shared the concern. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Daniels, manager of special projects for Waste Management of California, 
said the company would "absolutely" still pursue the site when the issue goes 
to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the ground-water issue, the planning commission members said they were 
opposed to the Gregory Canyon site because it is considered sacred by the Pala 
band of the Mission Indians who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns focused on the necessary relocation of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric Co. power lines that now cross the property, the proximity of the site 
to underground water lines bringing California Aqueduct water to San Diego 
County and geological fractures under the site that could undermine its 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The commission rejected the Aspen Road site in Fallbrook because of the weight 
of testimony -- including from the U.S. Marine Corps -- that, if the landfill's 
polyethelene-and-clay liners were to fracture, the garbage toxics would 
contaminate the Santa Margarita River basin, which provides Camp Pendleton with 
70% of its water. 
</P>
<P>
The third site -- Blue Canyon, near Warner Springs -- was summarily dismissed 
by the commission because of the danger of ground-water contamination and also 
because of its distance from North County's population centers and fear that it 
would prove too expensive for trash haulers and, ultimately, North County 
residents who would have to pick up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Dave Kreitzer also faulted that site because it is the most 
pristine natural habitat of the three sites under consideration.

PEACE ERUPTS IN CAPITOL CORRIDOR;

Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego) on Friday verbally confronted -- 
some witnesses say even slapped -- an Orange County colleague who accused him 
in a public letter of voting to "keep pornography available to your children." 
</P>
<P>
The shouting match erupted early Friday in a Capitol corridor when Peace ran up 
to Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and began shouting about 
Ferguson's letter, published in that morning's San Diego Union. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in an almost incoherent, wild condition of rage," Ferguson said. "And 
he was screaming and whaling his arms. He had a piece of paper, a news clip, 
and was screaming something that he wasn't a pornographer." 
</P>
<P>
One witness who asked not to be identified said he saw Peace slap the elder 
Ferguson, using an open right hand to deliver a glancing blow to the shoulder. 
But both Peace and Ferguson denied there was any contact. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said one of his aides was so rattled by Peace's outburst that she went 
into a nearby legislative office and called for help. A young man ran out into 
the hallway and pinned Peace, still yelling, against the wall, Ferguson said. 
Also helping to separate the men was Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
"We were both exchanging our opinion," Peace said. "I think what happened is 
that people came out of the offices and totally misinterpreted the situation. 
It was weird, totally weird." 
</P>
<P>
Both men decided to continue their discussion in Peace's legislative office, 
but the San Diego legislator was still irate, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get in the elevator and he's still yelling and scared some people," 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a letter Ferguson sent to newspapers in Peace's district accusing 
the San Diego County lawmaker of following the lead of Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) in tying up a bill that would effectively ban sales of 
pornographic tabloids from sidewalk newspaper racks. In a procedural move, 
Peace and other Democrats voted against the measure July 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers and fathers, you can rest easy," Ferguson wrote. "Be assured that your 
State Representative, Assemblyman Steve Peace, has voted to keep pornography 
available to your children." 
</P>
<P>
The letter then urged readers to call Peace's Sacramento office and ask him 
personally about his vote. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said Peace was concerned about how the letter might affect his wife 
and children. At one point Friday, Ferguson said he would consider apologizing 
to Peace's wife, but later in the day said he would not. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also said Peace threw his fork during a noon luncheon for legislators 
when Burton made a joke about the incident after tempers had cooled. The fork 
nearly hit Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) in the head, Ferguson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the last day of the 1990 legislative session. Lawmakers and 
legislative staff members had been working long hours for the past week to pass 
hundreds of bills by midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Frayed nerves were blamed for short tempers that erupted Tuesday night, also 
over a San Diego-related incident, as one lobbyist took a swipe at Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward). 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer confronted the lobbyist, former San Diego Sen. Bob Wilson, and accused 
him of working for San Diego County judges who hoped to hold on to an 
arrangement for enhanced pension benefits. During the last week of the session, 
Lockyer has called the pension benefits a "backdoor" raise and has worked to 
undo the arrangement, which passed the Legislature last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Beard Jr., the Senate's chief sergeant-at-arms, said this week that he 
stepped between the men when Wilson tried to hit Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I intervened when Mr. Wilson took a swipe at the member," Beard said. "His arm 
came back, and it was more in a punch motion, but I don't know if it (Wilson's 
hand) was in a fist. It could have been a strong shove."

LANDFILL STUDY RAISES FEARS OF WESTSIDE CLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AFFLUENT AND POWERFUL NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH MAY STEER DUMP SITES 
TO THE CANYONS IN THE SAN FERNANDO AND SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS, GROUPS SAY AFTER 
REPORT DETAILS WASTE-DISPOSAL OPTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
A report classing certain mountain canyons as suitable for future landfills 
increases pressure to put more dumps in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys because Westside interests have the power to keep them out of their 
affluent neighborhoods, Valley politicians and environmentalists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Their skeptical analysis was just one of many reactions to the release Friday 
of a draft environmental impact report on possible dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that Blind, Towsley and Elsmere canyons above the Santa Clarita 
and San Fernando valleys, along with a Westside site encompassing Mission, 
Rustic and Sullivan canyons, could be used as landfills without polluting 
ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and environmentalists spent part of Friday ordering or picking up 
copies of the thick report and promised to scrutinize its data and conclusions, 
looking for flaws which could be used to block landfills from operating in 
their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, whose city would be flanked by dumps in 
Elsmere Canyon on the east and Towsley Canyon on the west, said of sanitation 
officials, "They're asking for a full-fledged battle out here." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy recalled the successful fight Santa Clarita Valley residents waged 
against plans for a toxic waste dump in Towsley Canyon in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought that viciously and won," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that new landfills would destroy wildlife habitat and 
that rumbling garbage trucks would create noise and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, the report says, environmental problems could be corrected or at 
least minimized through efficient design and operation of the landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The report also calls for expanding existing dumps, increased recycling and a 
reduction in waste. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared under the direction of the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts and county Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
The public has until Nov. 1 to comment on the report before a final version is 
prepared for the governing board of the sanitation districts and the County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The districts have long considered the four sites for landfills and the 
report's conclusion did not come as a surprise, Hunt Braly, an aide to state 
Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, along with the Santa Clarita City Council and Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, opposes a dump in Towsley Canyon, touted by wildlife enthusiasts as 
prime land for a state park. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the report's conclusions on three Westside canyons, it is clear 
that influential supervisors and Los Angeles City Council members will never 
permit a dump in that neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three scenic canyons -- Mission, Rustic and Sullivan -- are in the Santa 
Monica Mountains above Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know those are even less politically feasible than Towsley and 
Elsmere," Braly said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Board of Supervisors and Los Angeles City Council have already 
said that if a dump is opened in Elsmere Canyon, Mission, Rustic and Sullivan 
canyons will be declared off-limits for use as a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Zapple, who has long fought expansion of the Lopez Canyon Landfill above 
Lake View Terrace, said the environmental analysis of Mission-Rustic-Sullivan 
was merely a public relations ploy designed to give the impression that the 
county is considering dump sites outside the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Observers differed on the significance of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Braly said it shows the sanitation districts want to locate all new landfills 
in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"They want both Elsmere and Towsley, plus Sunshine Canyon," he said, referring 
to the proposed expansion of the dump above Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of so many dumps in one area would make the region the 
"armpit of Los Angeles," Braly said. 
</P>
<P>
But Marsha McLean of the Santa Clarita Valley Canyons Preservation Committee 
doubted the county is committed to opening a dump in Towsley Canyon, saying it 
was a political smoke screen meant to divert attention away from plans for a 
landfill in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The reliance on landfills could reduce efforts to recycle and reduce the amount 
of solid waste in general, said Jill Ratner, Venice-based director of Citizens 
for a Better Environment, a statewide group. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial reaction concern is that . . . it sounds like the county sanitation 
districts are still moving ahead on landfill development without having a good 
source reduction and recycling plan in place, and that still is putting the 
cart before the horse," Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
Observers were taken by surprise by the report's revelation that a private 
developer, Dale Poe Development Corp., had proposed building a dump in El Toro 
Canyon, a mile north of Blind Canyon, above Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Canyon is not a suitable site now because of its remote location, but 
might be considered a possible landfill site once Blind Canyon is filled, the 
report says.

BILL TO REGULATE TOXIC DUMPS ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS HEADS FOR ASSEMBLY PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate on Friday approved a bill to allow state regulation of toxic waste 
dumps and landfills built on sovereign Indian lands such as the one proposed 
for Campo Reservation in southeast San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego), was passed 
22 to 11 by the Senate and appeared headed for perfunctory approval in the 
Assembly late Friday before the end of the 1990 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's measure was inspired by fears that a Campo Indian plan to build a 
600-acre landfill on their reservation would be exempt from state control, 
although neighbors claimed it could leak into their ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians maintained that treaties and legal precedent leave them accountable 
to only the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs in building the private dump. 
</P>
<P>
But Peace persuaded his colleagues in the Assembly and Senate that the notion 
of Indian sovereignty is only being used as a smoke screen for out-of-state 
waste disposal companies to get around stricter California environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
He and supporters of the bill argued that federal officials are lax at best in 
regulating the dumps, and that the state should impose its rules because Indian 
landfills could pose an environmental hazard to water and soil outside of 
reservation boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Peace continued to predict that his bill will be challenged in court 
by Indian tribes. "The point of the bill is to get ourselves in the best 
position to win the litigation," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's bill originally applied to all 117 Indian reservations and rancherias 
in California, but he changed that to win the support of Northern California 
legislators representing remote Indian lands. As passed Friday, it exempts 
Indian lands in 28 of the state's 59 counties. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires state regulation of a proposed landfill only if there is a 
finding that an Indian landfill could affect the environment or public health 
of those living outside of reservation boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to work out the opposition with everybody in California, 
including San Diego-based operators competing for the Campo site," Peace said. 
"That's got to tell you something about why these other operators have resisted 
it. They have different intentions than the local guys have." 
</P>
<P>
He added that opposition from Indians on his bill was "extorted" by out-of-town 
waste disposal companies who said they would withdraw their offers to build 
private landfills on the reservations if the bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Campo case, the landfill represents a concerted effort by the small 
tribe to lift itself out of poverty, tribal representatives have said.

CSI HONORED BY U.S. CUSTOMS FOR ROLE IN BLOCKING NUCLEAR PARTS TO IRAQI FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In retrospect, Jerry Kowalsky says his good deed is all the more important, now 
that Saddam Hussein's army has conquered Kuwait and lurks only a few miles from 
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we helped put a dent in Saddam Hussein's development of nuclear 
weapons," said Kowalsky, the 57-year-old president of CSI Technologies of San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, Kowalsky received the Yorktown Certificate, which can only be 
bestowed by the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, for his part in 
cracking an Iraqi plan to illegally export nuclear weapon detonation devices 
made by his firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it was a privilege to have been put in a position to have slowed down 
Saddam Hussein's development program for nuclear weapons," he said. But "sooner 
or later," he added, the Iraqi leader is bound to obtain nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, Kowalsky received a transmission from a London exporter 
inquiring about the purchase of high-voltage capacitors, which, aside from 
detonators, have a wide range of uses -- depending on their power -- including 
flashcubes and heart defibrillators. 
</P>
<P>
But the specifications that came with the request made it clear to Kowalsky 
that a hospital was not the final destination. 
</P>
<P>
So he called federal officials and soon was teamed with San Diego Customs agent 
Daniel Supnick, who also received the award, but privately, as he is still 
undercover. 
</P>
<P>
The work of those two resulted in seven indictments in March. 
</P>
<P>
The episode started when Euromac Ltd., a London firm headed by Ali Ashour 
Daghir, sent CSI a query about a possible purchase of 40 capacitors. 
</P>
<P>
After Kowalsky notified authorities, customs officials said they identified 
Euromac as having done millions of dollars of business with Iraq during its war 
with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, after a year of correspondence and undercover work, 
Kowalsky and Supnick, posing as a CSI executive, traveled to London, where they 
met with Daghir and other Iraqi representatives at the Cavendish Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There the Iraqi agents specified that the capacitors were to be built to 
military standards, customs officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-month case culminated in late March with indictments for five 
individuals -- including Daghir -- and two British companies, including 
Euromac. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Iraqi representatives thought CSI was going along with their request, 
customs let the company handle all the paper work in the transaction, in effect 
running the operation entirely through them. 
</P>
<P>
As a detonator, the capacitor -- a gray cylinder about the size of a small soup 
can attached to a black plastic stem about 14 inches long -- is used to ignite 
conventional explosives, which implode the nuclear fuel, bringing it to 
critical mass, Kowalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
CSI, which has 35 employees, makes capacitors primarily for medical use, 
including defibrillators and lasers.

DR. ARTHUR CARLAN; CHIROPRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Carlan, a longtime Northridge chiropractor and Canoga Park resident, 
has died in North Hollywood. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Carlan died Aug. 24 from complications of lymphoma, said his son, Robert 
Carlan. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Oct. 29, 1918, Carlan attended the Pratt Institute 
in Brooklyn for a year following high school, studying graphic arts and pen and 
ink drawing. He served for five years in the U.S. Army during World War II, 
achieving the rank of first lieutenant. After he was discharged, he graduated 
from the Logan College of Chiropractic in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to California in 1951 and received his chiropractor's license, but 
instead went to work in the computer field. He held positions as a programmer 
and a systems analyst at Lockheed Corp. in Burbank and the Marquardt Co. in Van 
Nuys. In the late 1960s he was appointed director of education at the 
now-defunct Computer Training Institute in Encino. He later worked in a systems 
analyst at Litton Industries in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, he opened a chiropractic office in Northridge, where he worked 
full-time until two years ago when he cut back his hours to part-time. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said Carlan will be remembered for his humor, and his knack of 
having a joke for every situation. He wrote humorous rhymes that he complied 
into a 1983 book titled "If the Shoe Fits." 
</P>
<P>
He had a variety of interests including table tennis, bowling and billiards and 
helped start a Toastmasters Club in Northridge in the mid-1970s. He also 
enjoyed swing and ballroom dancing and was a member of the Tuesday Senior Dance 
Club, based in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Etta Carlan; a son, Robert Carlan of 
Beverly Hills; a daughter, Marlene Carlan of Los Angeles; and a sister, Lynn 
Ribakove of Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service was held Wednesday with burial at Eden Memorial Park in 
Mission Hills. Groman-Eden Mortuary in Mission Hills handled the arrangements. 
Donations can be made in Carlan's name to the Jewish National Fund in Los 
Angeles, which plants trees in Israel, or to the General Israel Orphans Home 
for Girls, 132 Nassau St., N.Y., N.Y. 10038.

SUSPECT FACES SMUGGLING CHARGES STEMMING FROM BOY'S DEATH ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A citizen of Mexico was charged Friday in federal court in San Diego with 
felony alien-smuggling linked to the death of an 8-year-old Mexican boy who was 
struck by a car and killed last month while dashing across Interstate 5 near 
the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Marin-Colon, 24, who was arrested Thursday by Border Patrol agents, may 
also face federal and state prosecution, possibly even an involuntary 
manslaughter charge, in the Aug. 8 death in northern San Diego County of 
Constantino Loreto Marin, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A manslaughter charge, which would be filed in state court, would mark an 
aggressive and novel turn in the prosecution of alien smuggling that results in 
highway deaths. The boy's death already has renewed calls for bolstered safety 
measures to reduce the hazard to the undocumented pedestrians who regularly 
cross busy San Diego-area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the count of illegal aliens negotiating the area's 
freeways on foot has increased dramatically, reflecting the rising volume of 
illegal immigration, U.S. officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said Friday that they are still deciding whether the 
manslaughter charge can be legally brought, but said initial indications are 
that it would be proper. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to satisfy the requirement of finding that (Marin-Colon) put (the 
boy) in deadly peril through a very negligent act," said John A. Hewicker, a 
deputy district attorney and chief of the office's complaints department. 
</P>
<P>
"But, geez, crossing eight lanes of high-speed traffic in the commission of a 
(purported) federal felony, it just seems like, and I haven't looked at the 
statutes or looked at the laws, it seems, common sense-wise, that it ought to 
be a punishable act," Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
Hewicker said deputies did not have an immediate deadline for reaching the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Marin-Colon, a native of the southern Mexican state of Guerrero who has listed 
his residence as Tijuana since last year, was arrested at 5 p.m. Thursday in 
San Ysidro, Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as Amado Marcial-Hernandez, he was identified in a photo lineup by 
other people who alleged he had smuggled them across the border, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Marin-Colon was charged Friday in federal court in San Diego with a single 
count of alien smuggling, Assistant U.S. Atty. Pat O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Barry Ted Moskowitz set a bail hearing for next Friday, O'Toole 
said. Marin-Colon is awaiting that hearing at the federal Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in downtown San Diego, O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Marin-Colon has been arrested twice on felony alien smuggling charges, once in 
September, 1989, and again last July, Swofford said. His record shows one 
misdemeanor conviction -- for illegal entry -- from the two cases, Swofford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, are studying additional charges against 
Marin-Colon, most likely conspiracy to smuggle aliens, O'Toole said. Charges 
directly stemming from the boy's death would have to be brought in state court, 
O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Constantino Loreto Marin, accompanied by his mother and five other brothers and 
sisters, was en route to Orange County from Mexico when he was hit and killed 
along I-5 shortly after midnight Aug. 8 by a southbound car. The driver of the 
car was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was last in line among a group that was crossing the freeway about 1 
1/2 miles north of the U.S. immigration checkpoint in northern San Diego 
County. He died at the scene.

* HomeFed Bank said it is cutting 104 more jobs from its payroll over the next 
60 days, bringing total reductions over the last month to 287 jobs, or 6% of 
the savings and loan's total. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based S&amp;L also said that more layoffs could be in store at 
the end of this month, after department heads at the S&amp;L file plans to 
further reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed has made the layoffs in response to a $108-million second-quarter loss 
and to counteract continued deterioration in its loan portfolio over the past 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Those being terminated are "corporate administrative" employees who work in 
four areas: retail banking, information services, real estate services and bank 
operations, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The employees are getting 60 days' notice, two weeks of base severance pay plus 
an additional week of severance pay for each year worked at HomeFed, a 
spokeswoman said.

CALIFORNIA RESERVISTS FLY EAST -- EXCITED AND WORRIED

<P>
It was just a little memento, something to get Steve Toberman through the 
lonely times while he's away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a letter from my 8-year-old daughter in my flight bag," said 
Toberman, 35, of Simi Valley. The message reads: "I love you, Daddy. Hurry up 
back." He said, "It's my good-luck charm." 
</P>
<P>
With a few lucky tokens tucked away, duffel bags neatly packed and Army boots 
shined to a slick black, 14 members of the 146th Aeromedical Evacuation 
Squadron at the Channel Islands Air National Guard boarded a C-130 Hercules 
cargo plane early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before noon, the group stopped first in Cheyenne, Wyo., to pick up 13 
more nurses and medical technicians. Next stop: Minneapolis, to pick up 18 
guardsmen. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the plane left there for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, there 
was barely any elbow room. Bags filled with chemical warfare gear and sleeping 
bags were stacked in piles in the back of the plane and in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands reservists have been through many missions together. 
They've been to Korea for training, they've spent weekends in Hawaii, they've 
gone on assignments in the West. But nothing compares to this, they said. 
</P>
<P>
And they're worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I look around this plane and I see the faces, and I wonder how many of these 
people will still be around when it's all over," Tech. Sgt. Dave Winger, 25, of 
Granada Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
He paused, his eyes a little misty. "Sometimes I dream about it, the war. 
That's when I worry about it the most." 
</P>
<P>
The reservists did not know whether they were actually going to Saudi Arabia, 
although some suspected that was the next step. All they had been told is that 
they were going to Germany. They spent much of Friday night waiting for a 
flight out. 
</P>
<P>
Some say they're more than concerned; they're scared. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it hit me when I packed the chemical warfare gear," said one woman, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands crew of seven men and seven women has been specially 
trained to evacuate the wounded from battlefields by air, to stabilize them and 
transport them to a hospital. It is especially dangerous, they say, because 
they may be forced to fly through war zones. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the fears and the dangers, the guardsmen say they are ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"After training for the past seven years, I'm happy to put my knowledge to 
work," Toberman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member crew -- all nurses or medical technicians -- volunteered for duty 
when President Bush decided to activate more than 49,000 reservists. The 
Channel Islands group is not the first from the 146th Squadron to join 
"Operation Desert Shield," the military name for the U.S. mobilization brought 
on by Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait. Two weeks ago, five other 
guardsmen were sent. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron has 165 members, most of them part-time reservists who normally 
serve one weekend a month and two weeks during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Air Force asked the Channel Islands base for 40 volunteers. But 
on Wednesday, the Pentagon said only 14 were needed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 guardsmen have various professions ranging from prison medic to college 
Spanish instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Friday, Chuck Collier, 46, of San Bernardino cuddled his son at 
the Channel Islands base. He said he's packed a pocket full of pictures of the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably have a few more teeth by the time I get back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He paused, then added: "We all have families we're leaving behind." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 11-hour trip across the country, the atmosphere was jovial. 
Some members of the group read books on politics and warfare, others slept. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, laughter would cut through the loud droning of airplane engines. 
And sometimes sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Elsa Rosales, 30, of Irvine touched the small diamond charm on the gold 
necklace around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
"My boyfriend gave this to me before I left," she said. "He said, 'Don't forget 
about me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Donato, 38, of Long Beach thumbed through a stack of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss my friends already," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then her mood lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the kind of person who is always looking for something new to do," she 
said. "I just think this is the chance of a lifetime."

Humberto Flores, 22, was headed north about 6 p.m. when he veered across the 
southbound lane and over a small embankment, authorities said. His vehicle 
wedged between rocks halfway down the 40-foot cliff and Flores was ejected, 
Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said.

LEGISLATURE APPROVES TRAFFIC SIGNAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state law aimed at improving traffic signal efficiency in Ventura has been 
passed by the Legislature and sent to the governor for approval, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation gives Ventura $200,000 to help it connect 40 of 95 traffic 
signals to a central Traffic Signal Surveillance System computer within the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The connection synchronizes the signals, allows them to adjust to traffic flow, 
detects malfunctions, reduces vehicle delay and improves air quality, said 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
The governor has until Sept. 30 to approve the legislation. SCOTT LAWRENCE

OWNER OF 2 HOTELS FIGHTS FEE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A company that owns two hotels in Oxnard is opposing a city proposal to charge 
hotels and motels a fee on room rentals to help finance the city's Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, said Friday that he is 
concerned about the opposition of the 140-room Casa Sirena and the 273-room 
Financial Plaza Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Martin V. Smith and Associates, which owns a controlling interest in the two 
hotels, said in a written statement that it opposes the assessment because 
hotels and motels are "already paying a substantial fee, and the industry 
cannot pass on more costs." 
</P>
<P>
Hotels and motels in Oxnard now pay a 9% bed tax. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the city considered eliminating the bureau to save $398,000 
and help reduce the city's projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the City Council voted to contribute $199,000 to keep the bureau open 
until December to give staff members time to identify a new source of funding 
for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Under the assessment, which was proposed in July, the city would charge a 2% 
fee on room rents for all hotels, motels and apartments for transients in the 
city and generate about $360,000 a year for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the city receives written protests from hotel and motel owners who 
would generate 50% or more of the fees, the city cannot legally form the 
district, city officials said. HUGO MARTIN

3 PLEAD INNOCENT IN DRINKING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers from Thousand Oaks pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of 
involuntary manslaughter in the April death of a 14-year-old boy whom they 
allegedly goaded into chugging whiskey, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, were arraigned in Santa Monica 
Superior Court in the alcohol poisoning death of Leland Scovis, the youngest of 
a group of five teen-age boys the brothers were chaperoning on a camping trip 
at Leo Carrillo State Beach, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott M. 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells are each charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter, four 
counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of contributing to the 
delinquency of a minor. They remain free on $5,000 bail each, which they posted 
when they were arrested in May. 
</P>
<P>
Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park pleaded not guilty to 
being an accessory to involuntary manslaughter and to five counts of 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Vernon, who is free on her own 
recognizance, is the sister of one of the boys on the trip and is engaged to 
David Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
They were ordered to stand trial by Malibu Municipal Judge Lawrence J. Mira 
during a preliminary hearing last month. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been scheduled for the trial, but pretrial motions in the case will 
be heard Oct. 12, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Leland Scovis was invited on the April 14 camping trip by Vernon's brother, a 
friend of his, according to testimony given during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the trip, David Campbell told a park ranger he would take 
responsibility for the boys and then supplied them with alcohol, witnesses 
said. Patrick Campbell allegedly bet Leland that he could not drink the two to 
three inches of alcohol left in a half-gallon jug of whiskey without getting 
sick, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Leland drank the whiskey and collapsed shortly afterward, witnesses said. He 
vomited and over the next one or two hours, and Patrick Campbell cleared his 
airway to help him breath. 
</P>
<P>
He and the boys also tried to revive Leland by dragging him to the ocean's edge 
and letting cold water wash over him. 
</P>
<P>
After Leland's breathing problems worsened and he stopped breathing, David 
Campbell administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the boy was taken to 
Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village. He died two days later. CAROL

FIRE IN HOUSE PROMPTS PROBE BY THE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State investigators on Friday were trying to determine whether a Pasadena house 
involved in a fire had been used to illegally house as many as 20 
developmentally disabled people. But Tina Castillo, 28, a resident of the 
two-story Summit Avenue house, said the only other occupants are nine members 
of her family. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the Thursday fire, which investigators say started when a 
pesticide room-fogger ignited after being placed too close to the kitchen 
stove. Firefighters evacuated up to 20 people, described in a Fire Department 
report as developmentally disabled, Battalion Chief Joe Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Thurston of the Pasadena Police Department said Friday that, "in the 
heat of what happened," calling them developmentally disabled was probably just 
"a bad choice of words." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, investigators with the state Department of Social Services say 
they are following up on a complaint that Castillo and others housed disabled 
adults at the house.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN COMPASSION SHOULD RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano city officials did the right thing this week when they 
granted cancer patient Linda Fisher permission to live in a recreational 
vehicle parked in the driveway of her cousin's home in the Alto Capistrano 
area. 
</P>
<P>
A neighboring couple complained that the presence of an RV doesn't meet city 
standards for a residential neighborhood. While that's true, this is that 
occasional instance where the letter of the rule should be waived in favor of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 41, is suffering from ovarian cancer. She's lost 140 pounds in the last 
18 months and is constantly connected to an intravenous pump. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she underwent several operations, including an ileostomy to allow her 
body wastes to be discharged into a plastic bag. Adding to her physical 
problems is the loss of her leg as a child in a hay-mowing accident. As if that 
weren't enough, her mother died in July from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Life is pretty tough for Fisher. Her RV, however, allows her to remain fairly 
independent because she doesn't have to go far to perform her daily tasks. She 
is also near her cousin when she needs help. 
</P>
<P>
While city officials at first expressed sympathy for Fisher, they said she 
would have to move her RV off her cousin's property by Aug. 27. But many people 
spoke up for Fisher, including some who formed "Friends of Linda Fisher." At 
their urging and that of Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents the 
area, the city granted a three-month reprieve, which could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
The city said Fisher must move her RV to the side of her cousin's house, out of 
sight of the offended neighbors. That's going to cost an estimated $20,000, 
because a retaining wall will have to be moved. Friends and family are coming 
to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, in announcing the extension, urged neighbors to be 
"supportive and sensitive." It's good that compassion has finally ruled in this 
neighborhood dispute.

A BIKER'S PLEA TO MOTORISTS: HELP END THE CYCLE OF DEATH;

Charles Bright recently died in the heat of the afternoon, not far from his 
home, riding a bicycle at the age of 51. They said he started as a Jungle 
Cruise guide and rose to a top corporate position at Disney. A friend called 
Bright "a dreamer, a doer." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Lundie was 66 when he died. Someone slammed into him and his bike on 
Santa Ana Canyon Road, and whoever it was didn't even bother to stop. Lundie's 
wife said he rode because "he loved it." 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of these men, and others like them, were reported in the pages of 
this newspaper. Men and women, of all ages, out on a bike for fun or exercise, 
enjoying the weather that has drawn us all here, killed in an instant of sheer 
negligence or recklessness or just plain bad luck. The statistics speak for 
themselves: During the past decade, bicycle fatalities in Orange County have 
doubled. Injuries have climbed sharply too. 
</P>
<P>
If you ride bicycles at all, and I do -- four, five times a week -- it's not 
really surprising. People are in a rush, always in a hurry to go somewhere, 
anywhere, and sometimes bikers just get in their way. 
</P>
<P>
Ride your bike sometime and see what I mean. It doesn't take long before you 
get the look: the icy glare of a motorist who resents having to share the road. 
Sometimes they'll flip you the finger, or honk, or if they're bold or reckless 
enough, veer into the bike lane just to give you a little scare. Just to show 
you who's boss. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly it's just the look, one of impatience, of having to slow for a group 
of cyclists. Certainly there are considerate, drivers out there who give bikers 
a little space, who recognize the inherent dangers. But all it takes is one, 
late for work, in a rush to pick up the kids, and we here at the newspaper will 
be writing another obituary -- and updating the grim statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is there is a lot of blame to go around. It's not always the 
motorist at fault. Some bikers run lights like the law doesn't apply to them, 
ride three abreast in the road, ride too fast for traffic, weave in and out of 
traffic, neglect their responsibility to let motorists know their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
These cyclists should know better, and no one can be held at fault if a hot-rod 
biker decides not to stop for the light because it will slow his momentum. 
</P>
<P>
But most serious bikers I know recognize the dangers and wisely ride in a way 
to cut the odds of the unthinkable. We ride 21-pound bicycles with a 6- to 
8-ounce piece of pressed Styrofoam on our heads. We take the risk because we 
love to ride, but we do what we can to reduce the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists ride because we love the sport, the freedom it offers, the sheer fun 
of it, the release from the stress of work. We enjoy the camaraderie of the 
pack, the physical demands. 
</P>
<P>
We ride on the road because that's what the law says we must do. And if we're 
not riding next to the curb, but near the bike-lane stripe, it's because it is 
the safest place to be. A lot of motorists don't seem to understand this. But 
slow down sometime and take a look at the debris littering the bike lane -- 
rocks, broken glass -- not to mention the drainage gates. Ride in the gutter 
and you won't be riding for long. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that many accidents are caused not by the anger of a motorist trying 
to get even, but by negligence, and ignorance. It's easy to misjudge the speed 
of cyclists. Many drivers pass you and then veer into the bike lane to make a 
right turn. By the time they slow for the turn, you're often closing in on 
their rear bumper, and the only way to avoid impact is to slide by on the left 
-- in the lane of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists have a responsibility to watch out for us, to signal us their 
intentions, to let us pass, just as we have a responsibility to make our 
intentions known. Bikers are taught to ride in straight lines, but excuse us if 
we do veer to avoid a broken bottle in the roadway. The typical road bike tire 
is about as wide as your thumb, and even a small rock can send us spilling into 
the road. So if we weave a bit, forgive us. 
</P>
<P>
And we should always use hand signals, make eye contact with drivers and make 
sure it is clear before cutting across lanes to make a left. And motorists must 
grant us equal rights. They shouldn't drive too close when there is room in 
another lane. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is home to thousands of avid recreational cyclists. We have 
families and children and jobs. We just also happen to have bikes. It also is 
home to some of the world's worst traffic. But we're going to have to learn to 
share the road. 
</P>
<P>
If not, we'll be writing more obituaries about people who simply "loved to 
ride."

WARM WEATHER PREDICTED -- FOR 'DEADLIEST' WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Southern Californians took to the highways for the last 
long weekend of summer, with prospects of mostly clear skies and warm weather 
through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be real pleasant," said meteorologist Stephen Burback of WeatherData 
Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures should reach the 70s at the beaches, the high 70s and low 80s in 
the mountains and 105 to 110 degrees at the Colorado River resorts in eastern 
deserts, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the good weather news. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the Labor Day holiday, from 6 p.m. Friday to midnight 
Monday, is generally the deadliest long weekend of the year, said California 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Alice Huffaker in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
She said 63 people died in traffic accidents on California's streets and 
highways over the Labor Day weekend last year. Most were not wearing seat 
belts, Huffaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Day weekend is what the CHP calls a maximum enforcement period. That 
means every available officer and patrol unit will be on the roads along with 
seven helicopters and 11 aircraft," Huffaker said. Last year, the CHP arrested 
almost 2,500 drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At the CHP's Southern Division headquarters, Officer Lydia Martinez urged 
motorists to check their cars for sufficient water and tire pressure before 
setting out on trips. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of people who try to get away for the summer one last time, and 
we find that a lot of them end up with disabled cars that could have been 
avoided if they had safety-checked their auto," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone to buckle their seat belts," Martinez said. It is especially 
important to have children in restraining seats, she said.

CAPSIZED YACHT STILL FLOATING TOWARD HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pandemonium might be the first boat to finish the 1991 Transpacific Yacht Race. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year after capsizing while returning from the '89 Transpac from Los 
Angeles to Honolulu, the 66-foot ultralight has been sighted once again, still 
floating upside down -- this time 800 miles northeast of Hawaii on a slow drift 
toward the islands. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified oceanographic vessel reported to attorneys for the insurers 
that they saw the boat -- distinctive because of a white hull and naked keel 
bolts -- Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Desmond McCallum, who had chartered the boat to another sailor for the 
race, received $335,000 in compensation for the loss. The San Francisco law 
firm of Derby, Cook, Quinby and Tweedt has filed a civil suit in San Diego 
seeking $360,053 in damages against six defendants, including the designers, 
Nelson-Marek. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sued everybody having to do with the keel," a spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
The requested damages include $22,553 in personal property of the crew and 
$2,500 for a flyover after a first sighting in early February. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also plans to attempt to salvage the boat, which, at its current rate 
of drift, could beach itself in Hawaii late next spring, shortly before the 
start of the '91 Transpac. 
</P>
<P>
Pandemonium flipped 300 miles off San Francisco on Aug. 3, 1989, when its keel 
fell off. A crew of five clambered onto the overturned hull and was picked up 
by a freighter late that night. 
</P>
<P>
It was next seen early in February by a Matson Navigation Co. vessel about 700 
miles southwest of that location, but a plan for a salvage operation was 
delayed when a seagoing tug was unable to leave Newport Harbor because of the 
Huntington Beach oil spill. By the time they could have left, salvagers 
figured, the boat would have drifted too far to be located again.

CSUN'S DEBUT IN DIVISION I A MIXED SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All things considered, Cal State Northridge's initial foray into NCAA Division 
I competition this season turned out rather well. 
</P>
<P>
The women's volleyball team, the first Northridge team to open play this season 
after the school moved to Division I in all sports except football and men's 
volleyball (the latter is already in Division I), split two matches Friday in 
the Arizona State tournament in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge lost its opener to Texas Tech, 15-13, 15-7, 15-12. However, CSUN 
defeated Arizona State, 15-13, 15-3, 16-14, in the afternoon match of the 
five-team, round-robin event. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Dixon had a team-high 14 kills for Northridge in the opening match, 
and teammate Patricia Fitzsimmons added seven. Kathleen Dixon had six kills, 
Nancy Nicholls and Michelle Swalec each had five and setter Beth Welch had 34 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity level was not high enough in the first match," Northridge 
assistant Mora Kanim said. "We got it together in the second match." 
</P>
<P>
Against Arizona State, Kathleen Dixon had a team-high 11 kills and Welch had 
five kills and 29 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will play Northern Arizona at 11 a.m. today and will face UC Irvine 
in the afternoon.

ESCOTO OUT, CRIDER IN AS COACH AT CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of the school year just two weeks away, Bort Escoto took the 
Cleveland High basketball team to Magic Mountain on Tuesday, an excursion he 
expected would promote team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Everything went as planned and Escoto, named Cleveland's coach in June, was 
fully prepared for the ride of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had a great time," Escoto said. "Everybody was fired up and ready to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he went from fired up to fired upon after Cleveland announced 
that it had hired Los Angeles High Coach Kevin Crider to replace Escoto. 
</P>
<P>
Crider, who could not be reached Friday, led Los Angeles to the City Section 
3-A Division final in 1989. He becomes Cleveland's fourth coach in 15 months. 
Escoto replaced Marc Paez, who led the Cavaliers to the City 4-A semifinals 
last winter but resigned in June after one season. Paez replaced Bob Braswell, 
who left after the 1989 school year to become an assistant at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Escoto, 24, was hired on a walk-on basis two months ago and coached the team 
through its summer-league schedule. He said he had been led to believe that the 
position was his for the 1990-91 season, however, and expressed resentment over 
the way Crider's hiring was conducted by Cleveland Principal Ida Mae Windham. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I think she used me," said Escoto, who coached the B and C teams 
at Cleveland for the past two seasons and has served as an assistant for six. 
"When Marc left, it was a mess. I came in and cleaned up Dodge, and now I'm 
being ridden off into the sunset." 
</P>
<P>
Windham could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Kindseth, Cleveland's administrator in charge of athletics, 
Crider's hiring was the culmination of a series of events, beginning with an L. 
A. Unified School District ruling last week that granted Cleveland status as a 
minority school. Kindseth said the ruling, which certifies that more than 50% 
of the Cleveland student body is of minority composition, gave administrators 
latitude in shuffling teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
Escoto, who is employed at Cleveland as a noon aide, was handed the job after 
no replacement could be found for Paez, an English teacher and a member of a 
minority. At the time of Escoto's hiring, no teaching positions were available 
in Cleveland's physical education department, eliminating most coaches from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland sought a full-time, credentialed coach all along, Kindseth said, but 
had trouble locating one who satisfied the dual requirement of being a minority 
and an English teacher. Crider, who is black, teaches P. E., Kindseth said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this is a reflection on Bort," Kindseth said. "He's equally as 
talented as Kevin. But Bort is a walk-on and is not credentialed." 
</P>
<P>
Kindseth said that even though administrators were uncertain whether the 
district would grant Cleveland minority status, he and Windham continued to 
interview credentialed coaches, speaking with "at least seven to 10." 
</P>
<P>
Kindseth said Escoto was welcome to return as the B and C coach, but Escoto 
said Friday he was uncertain about accepting. He said he received notification 
of Crider's hiring Thursday from Windham's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"She called and said Kindseth needed to talk to me," Escoto said. "But she said 
he couldn't come to the phone right then because he was showing the new coach 
around school." 
</P>
<P>
Escoto had promised a return to the take-no-prisoners style that had made 
Cleveland the Valley's biggest winner in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really starting to adjust to what Coach Escoto wanted from me," forward 
Brandon Martin said.

CANYON ENFORCES 55 LIMIT;

FOOTBALL: COWBOYS WIPE OUT ST. LOUIS, 40-0, END HONOLULU SCHOOL'S LONG WIN 
STREAK.

Former streak makers became streak breakers on a memorable night at Aloha 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Before a stunned crowd estimated at 15,000, Canyon High clobbered St. Louis, 
40-0, Thursday night in the feature game of the Shawn Akina Memorial Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the game was played after midnight Pacific Daylight Time and Canyon 
gave St. Louis a rude awakening, severing the Crusaders' win streak at 55. It 
was the nation's longest current streak by a large school and second longest 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
In becoming the first team to defeat the Crusaders since 1985, Canyon was never 
more grand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely one of the best games the Cowboys have ever played," said 
Coach Harry Welch, who in eight seasons has led Canyon to three Southern 
Section championships and a 46-game winning streak that ended in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys enforced a streak limit of 55 on the Crusaders, the four-time 
defending Hawaii state champions. 
</P>
<P>
Leading only 7-0 after a penalty-marred first half, Canyon began the third 
quarter by driving 70 yards in eight plays for a touchdown. After St. Louis ran 
three plays and punted, the Cowboys marched 56 yards in eight plays for another 
score and a 20-0 lead with 2 minutes 52 seconds to play in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
As they say in Hawaiian, St. Louis was pau -- finished. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon scored three more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including an 81-yard 
interception return by Joey McKeon with 7:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
David McDivitt (207 yards) and Mike Torres (85) led an unstoppable Canyon 
ground game that rolled up 337 yards -- more than St. Louis allowed all last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, our offense got stronger and stronger," Welch said. "I 
don't know of many teams in America that are better conditioned than us." 
</P>
<P>
Or that gang tackle any better. Or that control the line of scrimmage any 
better. Canyon beat St. Louis at its own game, outhitting a group that 
intimidates every other team in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders had 102 total yards, only 38 rushing. Returning all-state 
quarterback John Hao completed nine of 17 for 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon rushed for more yards in the first quarter (87) than St. Louis allowed 
in any game last year. Two first-half touchdowns by McDivitt were nullified by 
penalties or the blowout would have begun sooner. The Cowboys had 95 yards in 
penalties, 80 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
A one-yard plunge by quarterback Kevin Bialas with 1:15 to play in the half 
finally broke the scoreless tie. The run capped a 55-yard, 11-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
If not for the large crowd and synthetic turf, the second half would have 
looked like just another Golden League Canyon rout. The offensive line of John 
Doherty, Sean Gloeckner, Chris Fellows, John Artimovich and Steve Conley 
created openings that grew larger as the game progressed. 
</P>
<P>
McDivitt and Torres, no-frills runners who know the shortest distance to the 
goal line, romped through the holes virtually at will. All but seven 
second-half Canyon plays were runs by the duo. 
</P>
<P>
Four others were quarterback sneaks by Bialas, who hit Jim Zopelis with a 
nine-yard touchdown pass to begin the second-half scoring and rushed for his 
second touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas, a senior making his first varsity start, completed only four of 12 and 
threw two interceptions. He mostly kept matters simple by handing the ball to 
Torres and McDivitt. 
</P>
<P>
McDivitt's season was in doubt only a month ago after he suffered a concussion 
during a passing league game. After 23 bruising carries with an 8.8-yard 
average, it is clear that his head has recovered -- now it's his running style 
that's concussive. 
</P>
<P>
"Our line was incredible, blowing those guys back like a knife through butter," 
McDivitt said while dancing a giddy hula in front of the Canyon stands after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon contingent, more than 300 strong, poured onto the field, and not 
until the stadium lights were shut off did everyone leave. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, St. Louis Coach Cal Lee stood with Welch, shaking his head as if he 
had just witnessed Diamond Head erupt. 
</P>
<P>
"You have an awesome football team, coach," Lee told Welch. "I thank you for 
showing my kids a lesson. You did me a great favor. You really did."

Crespi High carved up a more physical Kahuku team when it counted, defeating 
the Oahu public-school champion, 21-14, Thursday night before 7,500 at Aloha 
Stadium in the third game of four in the Shawn Akina Memorial Classic.

<P>
Crespi quarterback Cody Smith, a junior, completed 14 of 25 passes for 195 
yards, including a game-winning 45-yard strike to sophomore running back Torie 
Lee with 7 minutes 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also hit wide receiver Ryan Kieling on identical 19-yard fade patterns 
for scores in the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Kahuku's ground attack led to two first-half touchdowns and Crespi trailed, 
14-7, at halftime. STEVE HENSON

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE VS. NORTHERN ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Northern Arizona's Walkup Skydome: 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors appear to have an arsenal of offensive weapons. The question is: 
Can the offensive line protect quarterback Sherdrick Bonner and tailback Albert 
Fann long enough to allow them to launch an attack? Bonner, a senior, passed 
for 1,817 yards last season and he has a plethora of fast and experienced 
receivers as targets. Then there is Fann (6-foot-2, 215 pounds), a senior who 
is considered a top candidate for the Harlon Hill Trophy, which annually is 
presented to the top player in NCAA Division II. Fann has accounted for 5,446 
yards in rushing, receiving and kick returns in his Northridge career, and, 
with 3,172 rushing yards, he is only 400 shy of Mike Kane's school record. 
Rodney Menzel (6-3, 250), CSUN's left guard, is the only starter returning on 
the offensive line, which Coach Bob Burt describes as "talented but as yet 
untested." On defense, Mario Hull (6-4, 225), Ken Wallace (6-3, 240), Ken 
Vaughn (6-2, 238) and Terrell Taylor (6-2, 220) form what should be the best 
crew of linebackers in many years. Tackle Tom Berry (6-4, 255) and free safety 
Clayton Bamberg (6-2, 205) also are defensive standouts back from last season's 
6-5 team. Northern Arizona, 3-8 last season, has a new coach -- former UCLA 
assistant Steve Axman. Axman was the quarterback coach at Maryland last season, 
so look for John Bonds (6-4, 200), a transfer from Arizona State, to throw.

And look for Julian Howard (5-11, 170), a sophomore, to catch -- he grabbed 31 
passes for 615 yards and three touchdowns last season. Tailback Anthony 
Simmons, who gained 95 yards in 31 carries in a reserve role last year, could 
lead the ground attack. The Lumberjacks' starting fullback is Quinn Fauria 
(6-0, 205), a former Crespi High standout. A crowd of more than 8,000 is 
expected at Walkup Skydome. The game will be broadcast locally on KGIL 
(1260-AM), beginning with a 15-minute pregame show at 2:45 p.m.

ASS'AD, CS NORTHRIDGE PLAYING FOR KEEPS IN DIVISION I SOCCER DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marwan Ass'ad is an excitable person. When he talks about soccer, his eyes get 
big, his face takes on a youthful glow and his optimism is almost contagious. 
</P>
<P>
Which explains why Ass'ad, the Cal State Northridge soccer coach, sounds 
believable when he predicts that his team can win in its first year in Division 
I. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a team like this," Ass'ad said. "There was so much commitment 
and participation in the spring and the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the desire of the players, the motivation of the players and the 
way they prepared themselves, I anticipate us being very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Ass'ad takes pride in a Division II legacy that included two national runner-up 
finishes and six consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles. But, 
not being one to live in the past, he is ready to get on with the new challenge 
of qualifying for the Far West regional in his squad's first year of Division I 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN will take the first step toward that goal tonight at 7:30 in its Division 
I opener at North Campus Stadium. The opponent is UC Irvine, which went 3-15-1 
last season but has seven starters returning. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors also welcomed back seven players: defenders Ed Burns, Teddy Davila 
and Don Imamura; midfielders Terry Davila, John Alevras, and Bobby Reyes; and 
halfback Scott Piri, the leading returning scorer (six goals, four assists). 
</P>
<P>
Transfers Joel Entreken, a goalkeeper from Point Loma Nazarene College in San 
Diego, and Gustavo Cardenas, an All-American forward from Cosumnes River 
College in San Francisco, bolster the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
So do freshmen Dominic Zapata of Agoura High, Ronnie Simpson of L. A. Baptist 
and Armando Valdivia of Ridgecrest Burroughs. Jason Cherry, a transfer from Cal 
State Fullerton, will backup Entreken. 
</P>
<P>
Ass'ad's optimism is not based purely on expectation. The coach cherishes his 
team's previous encounters with Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last seven years we've beaten top Division I teams," Ass'ad said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference now, according to Ass'ad, whose teams were 109-29-15 in Division 
II, is that every game counts. 
</P>
<P>
"In Division II for the last seven years, when we lost a nonconference game -- 
and we didn't lose many -- I took it as 'well, we learned from it,' but there 
was no damage," Ass'ad said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, if you lose Sept. 1 and finish well, it can come back to haunt you. 
The players have known that since last spring. We made the point that it is 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't come to training camp out of shape. In Division II, teams are ready 
to play great by October. In Division I, they are ready to play great Sept. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Another difference is the style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"In Division II, we'd say, 'we play our game, let them adapt', " Ass'ad said. 
"In Division I, we're going to have to mark some guys. We might have to use 
four defenders one time and three another. Sometimes we might use five 
midfielders. Sometimes we'll only use one forward. 
</P>
<P>
"We will scout the teams. We will adjust and we will adapt." 
</P>
<P>
Record and strength of schedule will be used to determine who gets the five 
berths awarded to Division I independents for the Far West regional playoffs. 
An automatic berth goes to the Big West Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State, Portland, and Washington, three of the teams who advanced to 
the Far West regional last season, are on the Matadors' schedule. But so are 
Westmont and The Masters' College, lower-division teams that Northridge 
struggled against last season in going 10-5-4. 
</P>
<P>
"The schedule is not the strongest on the West Coast in Division I, but we have 
a very good chance of proving if we belong in the playoffs or not," Ass'ad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes victories over UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, St. Mary's and UC San 
Diego -- teams he describes as "on the outside looking in" -- are critical. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, they are plausible, in Ass'ad's mind.

GO EAST, YOUNG WOMAN, RACING ESTABLISHMENT SAID; 
</P>
<P>
RACING: BUT APPRENTICE JOCKEY CHRISTINE DAVENPORT INSISTS ON MAKING HER MARK AT 
DEL MAR, AMONG THE BIG BOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainers, agents and even fellow jockeys tell her to go elsewhere. They explain 
that some of the best jockeys have problems getting mounts at Del Mar, let 
alone winning races. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cauthen once went through a zero-for-120 streak on the Southern 
California circuit. Ron Hansen came to Del Mar this year as a highly touted 
jockey from the Northern California racing circuit, but he left after winning 
just three of 73 races. Apprentice Vann Belvoir, 16, made a name for himself in 
Seattle and thus landed a prominent agent in Scotty McClellan, but he left Del 
Mar shaking his head after winning just two of his 89 races. 
</P>
<P>
So why does Christine Davenport, who has won just three times in almost two 
full meetings at Del Mar, insist on getting rid of her bug -- race track 
shorthand for her apprentice label -- against perhaps the best collection of 
jockeys in the world? 
</P>
<P>
Why does she put up with dressing with the other women in a barber shop, where 
there's no TV monitor or toilet? 
</P>
<P>
"Why go where it doesn't count?" she asks. "So you're winning races and riding 
horses that are about ready to break your neck. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to it than competing with the big boys or looking out for her 
own safety. To Davenport, the issue is much bigger. 
</P>
<P>
It's about blazing a trail for her gender on a circuit that has always been 
dominated by males. Sure, female jockeys have shown they can ride. Julie Krone, 
27, has won nearly 2,000 races on the "Jersey Circuit," and other women have 
been successful on the East Coast and in Europe. But never at Hollywood Park, 
Santa Anita or Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to stay here for a while and make these people open their eyes," 
said Davenport, 25, with a touch of self-determination in her voice. "If don't 
do it, I don't see anybody else coming up behind me. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's kind of silly we're even talking about this in the 1990s. 
And I can see why people would not me to ride their horses, because women have 
never been successful here. I guess you're not going to change people's mind 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
But most say people's minds will never be changed. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Brian Mayberry said Davenport's cause is noble but probably futile. 
</P>
<P>
"Julie Krone is an outstanding talent, but she would have a tough time out 
here," said Mayberry. "It's just an awfully tough place to get started for 
anyone, but for a woman, it's even tougher. Historically, it's just been 
difficult for women here." 
</P>
<P>
McClellan said it will continue to be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to ride a guy before a girl," he said. "Not that I would, but 
other people would. Right now, it's as tough as I've ever seen it out here. And 
that's for anybody. There's only about 27 horses (three a race) with a 
legitimate chance of winning, and there's 10 to 12 jockeys that are vying for 
those horses. I'd love to see her do well, but she's fighting a tough battle." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye said he'd like to see things change for women jockeys, but 
he doesn't know if they ever will. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they don't feel (a woman) is as strong as a man," he said. "Back East, 
they give a woman a better chance of running. Over the years here, I've seen 
some good lady riders, but they've never stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye, who was the leading rider at Del Mar in 1989, said he gives 
Davenport the best shot of anybody he's seen. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows where she's at on a horse," he said. "I don't think she's very 
strong on a horse, but I think people make too big a deal of that sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye's advice to Davenport? 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, if I was her and I wasn't riding or winning much, I'd ride 
somewhere else. I'd go where I'd get some more experience." 
</P>
<P>
But Davenport, who's been riding for six years, feels she already has enough 
experience. After beginning her career as an exercise rider at Thistledown, 
outside of Cleveland, Davenport worked at tracks in Minnesota and Florida 
before coming out to Caliente in 1988. Then in December, 1988, Davenport won 
nine races and qualified to begin her apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Davenport would ride at Caliente on the weekends, where she 
received $150 per victory, then drive up to Fairplex in Pomona or Los Alamitos 
during the week. Finally, in 1989 she broke through at Hollywood Park's fall 
meeting and won six races in six weeks. But at Del Mar, last summer, she won 
just twice in 16 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Overall in 1989, Davenport won on 21 of her 283 mounts, with 14 seconds and 27 
thirds -- not bad for a debut season. But this year, except for winning her 
first stakes on On The Menu at Golden Gate Park in Berkeley, has been 
disappointing. She was suspended for five days for a racing infraction at Santa 
Anita and won just twice there. At Hollywood Park, she won only once in 19 
mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Although she won Friday on Mats Dolly, a 5-1 third favorite, Davenport's Del 
Mar meeting has not been a banner one either -- she is two for 15 with no 
seconds or thirds. Female jockeys Joy Scott, Vicky Frontiere and Kim Davis have 
not fared much better -- they are 0 for 11 with one second, by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport's winning mount two weeks ago perfectly illustrates the plight of the 
female jockey at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was originally supposed to ride Masai Chief, an 87-1 shot, but he left 
to ride at Bay Meadows. Jockey after jockey turned down the ride on Masai Chief 
until Davenport spoke up and took the mount. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff on Masai Chief of $177.40 was the biggest at Del Mar in 16 years -- 
for her part, she earned a little over $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I won the Derby," she said. "It was the first live horse I've had 
this meeting. I feel like whenever I'm on a horse that's running, I usually 
know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
But those opportunities have been rare for Davenport. Usually, she's on a 
longshot. 
</P>
<P>
But then, it's hard to get decent mounts when you don't have an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"Agents and I have never really gotten along," said Davenport, who has 
nonetheless agreed to take on a part-time agent for now. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow though, Davenport plods on, believing that she will be the first female 
jockey to strike it rich in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only going to get better," she said. "I figure I've already gone through 
the hard part."

In the years that I have had the distinct pleasure of seeing my work being 
performed in Los Angeles, I have always had the greatest respect for Sylvie 
Drake's perceptive and, in my case, supportive reviews. So it was the more 
surprising to suffer the indignity of my play, "Acapulco," casually dismissed 
as sex, sex, sex, when it is about anything but sex. 
</P>
<P>
It is a comedy about human behavior, as witness the audience who, on the night 
Drake was in, laughed from beginning to end, although this was omitted from the 
review. 
</P>
<P>
Not to actually arrive until nearly 17 minutes late in this play of one hour 
and 15 minutes means that the references that are actually sowed in the 
beginning of the play have no corresponding note in the latecomers' minds -- 
and in my plays the beginning moments are crucial to the tone, stance and 
climate of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is set at the top of the play, when not only is a climactic scene 
missed -- which does a lot to explain the protagonist's character -- but a tour 
de force of acting in a cameo by the redoubtable Chandra Lee. To then review 
the play is to have lost the animus of the play and to witness only its 
aftereffect. I have no doubt that, had Drake seen the whole play, her 
dismissive review would have been written in an entirely different manner.

Wilmington's review of "The Witches" leads parents to believe that this movie 
is appropriate for children. I think he is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
I'm well into my 30s and I had trouble dealing with the graphic images and 
primal terrors the film presents. I read the book when I was 9 years old. It 
sent thrilling shivers up my spine, but a child's own imagination will conjure 
up images only as frightening as those to which they've been exposed. Someone 
else's larger-than-life conception, solidified on celluloid, influenced by the 
benefit of however many hardships Nicolas Roeg has endured (warts, scabs and 
all), is more than most kids can swallow. 
</P>
<P>
I saw a large 10-year-old boy climb onto his father's lap in the theater. Six- 
and 7-year-olds were dragging their parents into the lobby saying "Get me out 
of here!" as Anjelica Huston rotated her pelvis in anticipation of a young 
boy's transformation from Homo sapiens to rodent. 
</P>
<P>
This is strong psychological material for a child to assimilate. As a parent, 
my rating on a scale of "Thoughtful" to "Junk Food" would be "Nightmares for a 
Year."

I was horrified, but not surprised, at Michael Wilmington's review of "The 
Witches" (Aug. 24). The movie revolves around a plot by an organization of 
witches to turn the children of the world into mice. 
</P>
<P>
All the witches in the film are portrayed as ugly and evil old women. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are witches, and we celebrate and worship the Goddess 
(otherwise known as Mother Earth). The golden rule of witchcraft is "An it harm 
none, love, and do as you will." Witches believe that whatever you do, comes 
back to you threefold. Therefore we don't use magic at the expense of others. 
We have been slandered, tortured and burned down the centuries because we do 
not believe in the same God as the church (though we recognize other people's 
right to believe in whatever they like). 
</P>
<P>
"The Witches" is intended to be lighthearted fantasy. But what would 
Wilmington's reaction have been to a lighthearted fantasy called "The Jews" in 
which the Jews of the world were revealed to be ugly, evil people who plot "the 
destruction of every last child in England?"

<TEXT>
<P>
When that preserve of old-time Americana, Knott's Berry Farm, turns to rap 
music to pull in a big weeknight crowd, it's obvious that rap itself has come 
in from the fringes and turned into its own slice of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
Young MC, a product of the Los Angeles rap scene's Wild West, packed Calico 
Square, in the heart of the theme park's replica of an Old West ghost town. The 
first of his two shows Thursday night drew several thousand people -- among 
them plenty of moms and dads with rap-enthusiast offspring. 
</P>
<P>
For Knott's, as for the many youth-oriented advertisers whose commercials move 
to the thump of a beat box, it's good business to be associated with rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Live entertainment is something that can separate us from any of the other 
amusement parks. We know the importance of (booking) talent that is 
contemporary and popular," Knott's publicity director, Stuart Zanville said 
Thursday afternoon, before Young MC's scheduled evening shows. And these days, 
"contemporary and popular" defines rap, which has figured twice in the summer 
dance-pop series at Knott's (To lure an older contingent, the park also 
continues to present the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash, who plays at 
Knott's tonight and Monday). 
</P>
<P>
In July, Knott's presented a bill headlined by the Los Angeles rapper Mellow 
Man Ace, whose act includes a fair amount of salty sexual braggadocio. "We 
didn't get any complaints," Zanville said. Still, Knott's takes an act's 
reputation into account. It's not a likely venue for any of rap's political 
controversialists, or its X-rated sex exploiters. 
</P>
<P>
Young MC, a former USC economics major whose real name is Marvin Young, is an 
uncontroversial, good-time rapper who fits right into the show biz mainstream. 
Young co-wrote Tone Loc's sexy mega-hits, "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina." 
Despite some suggestive, PG-rated notions, neither of those songs, nor anything 
on Young's 1989 debut album, "Stone Cold Rhymin,"' is as sexually extreme as 
that convincingly salacious Jerry Lee blazing through "Breathless." 
</P>
<P>
As for Young's politics, they don't get any more controversial than "Just Say 
No," the imaginative title of an anti-drug rap on his album. For that matter, 
few of the rappers who specialize in tales of street violence have uttered a 
line as chilling as the one in Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues": "I shot a man in 
Reno, just to watch him die." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody objects to such sentiments coming from a well-loved entertainer who 
wears a cowboy hat. But don't bet on Knott's booking any rapper who tells a 
parallel story of crime and consequences set on ghetto streets. It's not the 
violence itself that keeps these rappers out of the entertainment mainstream 
represented by a place like Knott's -- shoot-'em-up entertainment is, after 
all, as American as the establishment's fruit pies. But rap's depictions of 
violence are a bit too real: They dredge up facts of underclass life that the 
safer, more comfortable majority would rather not confront. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Young MC's raps don't deal in such messy realities. His show was 
dominated by familiar conventions of pop shtick and, at the same time, suffered 
from many of the cliches and drawbacks unique to live rap. That combination of 
deficiencies both old and new made for a ho-hum performance. 
</P>
<P>
Rap, as has often been pointed out, is technological music that comes alive in 
the studio, but leaves little for a performer to add in the flesh. It takes a 
vibrant presence and a knack for storytelling to inject personality into a rap 
show and focus attention on the substance of the narratives strung among the 
beats. Only a few rappers can pull that off, and Young didn't indicate in his 
early show that he was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the 35-minute performance (short by any standard but rap's, where 
mini-sets are the norm) came right out of the can of old show-biz tricks. The 
show started and ended with taped sound effects depicting helicopter clatter on 
Young's arrival, and a jet's takeoff rumble on his departure. The show also 
included an orchestrated noisemaking contest between the boys and the girls 
(The rappers have picked up on this gimmick, formerly popular among the 
heavy-metal arena set). Like a confirmed trouper, Young also made sure to 
flatter the crowd at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
When rap becomes shtick (a Yiddish word coined by an earlier generation of 
minority entertainers), all gaps have been bridged. It may be new music, but 
it's show biz in the old tradition.

Austere yet beautiful, detached yet compassionate, Taiwanese filmmaker Hou 
Hsiao-hsien's superb 1987 "Dust in the Wind" tells a classically simple story 
of two rural young people who are in love and seek a better life in Taipei. Not 
surprisingly, the struggle for survival is harder than they anticipated. In 
fact, nothing is really surprising in the entire film, yet thanks to its 
director's masterly talents, it is deeply compelling. Throughout, Hou's 
discretion is palpable, manifested in his middle-distance, deep-focus shots; 
it's as if he did not wish to intrude upon his vulnerable couple. At the same 
time Hou's vision is unwavering, and we come away with both a sense of 
timelessness and a sense of immediacy -- of how the un- and semi-skilled are 
losing in an increasingly technological society. Wang Chien-wen is the young 
man, Hsin Shu-feng is the young woman, and they are perfect. KEVIN THOMAS

</P>
<P>
The first Taiwanese film ever to take a major festival award -- Grand Prize at 
the Venice Film Festival -- Hou Hsiao-hsien's "City of Sadness," is remarkable 
in many other ways. It has the density of a good novel, compressing years of 
frenzied social history, from the end of World War II to the end of the 
mainland Chinese revolution, into the experiences of one family. 
</P>
<P>
That family, touched by the local underworld, slides dizzily to disaster; 
meanwhile, their country careens through one social convulsion after another. 
The movie keeps a calm, ironic view, even during the most horrendous events: 
the street fights, disorder, repression and the escalating series of vendettas 
that drive the story's events. Hou's brilliant staging of fight scenes -- which 
explode seemingly out of nowhere and then surge right and left past the frame's 
edge -- is utterly distinctive and unnervingly realistic. His eye for 
significant detail is unerring, his images restrained and lovely -- and he is 
capable of suggesting deep, painful emotions without ever tumbling over into 
bathos. "City of Sadness," a masterpiece, is so packed with life, incident and 
rich detail, it can barely be assimilated on a single viewing. MICHAEL 
WILMINGTON

<P>
 Sunday, 8 p.m., Warner Grand, 478 W. 6th St., San Pedro; Tuesday, 8 p.m., 
Melnitz Theater, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
In this fascinating documentary, two filmmakers and a Maori princess 
collaborate across half a century on a poetic celebration of Zealand tribal 
culture. The subject is the waka taua building project: the 1938 construction, 
by Princess Te Puea Herangi's tribe, of a sacred boat. 
</P>
<P>
The footage of this painstaking job, the felling of huge trees, the laborious 
shoreward trek, intricate ceremonial carvings and final glorious launch -- was 
shot by Jim Manley in 1938; ever since, it has rested in the New Zealand Film 
Archive. Director Merata Mita has expertly edited Manley's work, sweetening it 
with an evocative soundtrack. The result has a bit of the monochrome lyricism 
of "Tabu" or "White Shadows in the South Seas," and a unique historical 
perspective. It's a one-of-a-kind experience. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Tracey Moffat's piercing vignette of an aboriginal woman coping in a desert 
cul-de-sac with the nerve-fraying illness of her mother. A mood piece in which 
the Outback is recreated mostly on the soundstage -- in shockingly vivid 
primary colors and images that suggest a Douanier Rousseau painting. 
Cobalt-blue skies, painted backdrops, a purringly ingratiating gospel singer, 
flashbacks to the ocean and a present full of sweat and misery -- Moffat weaves 
it all together with erratic but sometimes genuine power. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

COMPUTAINMENT: BATTLES, BOOTY AND BARBARIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All computer gaming is divided into three parts: arcade games, adventure games 
and simulations. Of these, simulations generally offer the greatest diversity 
of play and require the greatest degree of creativity. Arcade games tax your 
hand-eye coordination, and adventure games promise to stretch your imagination 
while mostly testing your vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, variations of those three types, such as Electronic Arts' 
"Centurion: Defender of Rome." The strategy game combines a rather involving 
simulation of the conquest of the Roman Empire with some silly arcade-type 
diversions. The tactical elements of the former make "Centurion" worth playing; 
the latter make it less worthy than a night with a couple of badly dubbed 
gladiator videos. 
</P>
<P>
In "Centurion," you play the role of an ambitious military officer subduing 
barbarians from the Pillars of Hercules to the sands of Arabia (no, this isn't 
what you would call topical) and moving up the Roman power structure to the 
rank of Caesar. You must pacify the hometown crowd with spectacles at the 
Colosseum and Circus Maximus as you win the hearts and minds of the colonials. 
And you do all of this on the meager wages of a career warrior and the 
occasionally generous booty of conquest. 
</P>
<P>
The best parts of "Centurion" are the combat scenes between the Roman legions 
and the various enemies. Sea battles are slightly less successful. 
</P>
<P>
Land battles are true tactical exercises that require you, as field general, to 
command a legion's individual units (called cohorts) of soldiers and cavalry in 
animated contests against usually worthy computerized opponents. The battles, 
which grow more complex as the game's level of difficulty is increased, involve 
the use of some simplified but standard Roman military maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
But "Centurion" rises above a conventional war game in the designers' noble 
effort to simulate the unexpected, irrational and frustrating elements of 
combat. War, even from an armchair general's point of view, is never as neat as 
the '40s movie scenes of Admiralty officers positioning their toy battleships 
and lead soldiers on huge maps would have had us believe. Even when everything 
looks to be in your favor, the wrong things just sometimes happen on the field 
of battle. It can be disheartening -- and deadly -- to watch the same soldiers 
who fought so fiercely and bravely in Gaul and Germania routed in Armenia or 
turn tail in panic in Mesopotamia. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the combat sequences, however, there is little subtlety in "Centurion." 
Although you occasionally get to use diplomatic rather than military skills to 
achieve your short-term goals of taking over a particular region, the game has 
no real strategy beyond world conquest. 
</P>
<P>
The politics of "Centurion" is absurd, cynical at best. Local populations grow 
restless or angry under the Roman yoke, but they can be mollified with an 
arcade-style gladiator contest or a chariot race. Big deal. Where is the 
palatine intrigue? Where are the Senate allies and enemies? Where are the 
rivals for the job of ruler of the world? 
</P>
<P>
"Centurion" would be a far better game if the designers had spent as much time 
learning the Rome of "I, Claudius" as they did "Spartacus." 
</P>
<P>
One final note: The documentation that comes with "Centurion" is quite poor and 
includes at least one glaring omission -- it does not tell you how to move a 
legion off ships. (It took a call to the publishers to find out that we had to 
click the right mouse button.) The organization of the manual and the 
accompanying command summary card also leave much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
"Centurion," published by Electronic Arts of San Mateo, Calif., requires 640K 
RAM for EGA, VGA or MCGA graphics cards, or 384K for Tandy 16 color systems. 
The game comes in either 3 1/2-inch or 5 1/4-inch disk versions, and play is 
best with a mouse. An off-disk copy protection method is used. List price: 
$49.95.

DIRTY ROTTEN IMBECILES THRASH THE PALACE WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As surely as Chubby Checker blows into town to play the twist or Frankie 
Yankovic to play the polka, the thrash band Dirty Rotten Imbeciles sweeps in 
from the Bay Area to propel a dance-floor scene of its very own. D.R.I. is the 
Myron Floren of the slam pit, and at the Palace on Thursday, things were 
slamming indeed. 
</P>
<P>
When D.R.I. plays, the floor looks from above like those speeded-up studies of 
Grand Central Station in "Koyaanisqatsi," constant jiggling, exaggerated flows 
of motion, more frenzied roiling than the eye can comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, a half-naked body would launch from the midst of the Palace 
crowd, twisting in the air like a Sea World porpoise. D.R.I. is sort of a 
speeded-up version of reality too: very fast, very tight, highly professional, 
sort of catchy; the sort of hyper-speed guitar drone every hard-core punk band 
aspired to. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good dance band, D.R.I. leaves the spectacle to its audience. Halfway 
through the set, singer Kurt Brecht apologized for the onstage security, who 
shrugged and retired to the wings. "OK, let's see what you can do," Brecht 
said. "Just don't thrash the equipment." And an incredible hail of bodies began 
from the Palace stage, sometimes half a dozen at a time, doing back-flips, 
belly-flops, cannonballs, springing like fleas or settling into the crowd like 
Grandpa into his rocker. A great D.R.I. show, which this was, is one of the 
great spectacles of rock. JONATHAN GOLD

POP BEAT / SOUL: OLETA ADAMS, TRACIE SPENCER SOAR IN ORBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oleta Adams and Tracie Spencer are making some of the most glorious music in 
the soul genre, their new releases topping the current crop from the women of 
R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, 29, was the featured vocalist on Tears for Fears' "Seeds of Love" album 
and tour, and she emerges as a special talent on her own recording debut. She 
has the kind of stunning, powerful voice that creates great musical 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer is only 15, but she displays a freshness and substance that 
better-known singers twice her age can't match. Albums are rated on a scale of 
one star (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
**** Oleta Adams, "Circle of One," PolyGram. It's hard to resist hyperbole when 
describing a recording artist such as Adams. Some of her debut LP may be 
plodding and self-consciously tasteful, but the first half is virtually 
flawless, particularly Adams' gorgeous handling of Brenda Russell's "Get Here." 
It's easy to liken her to everyone from Chaka Khan to Anita Baker to Roberta 
Flack, but Adams can knock your socks off in a way that defies comparison. If 
this record is any indication of what listeners can expect in the future, Adams 
herself may soon become the yardstick by which other contemporary female 
singers are measured. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Tracie Spencer, "Make the Difference," Capitol. Spencer is right on 
target with most of what she attempts here, and while she's obviously aiming at 
her own peer group, there's nothing teeny-bopperish about her approach. Clearly 
influenced by Janet Jackson, Spencer has recorded several tracks that rival 
some of Jackson's recent singles -- and she's also a stronger, more confident 
singer. "Make It Funky" is one of the showcase dance cuts here, and Spencer 
performs it with a boldness and conviction that James Brown would no doubt 
endorse. From ballads ("Love Me") to message songs ("This House"), Spencer has 
a sound you don't have to be a teen-ager to love. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Brenda Russell, "Kiss Me With the Wind," A&amp;M. Intelligent and 
insightful, Russell writes songs that make her sound like someone you'd want as 
a confidante. She approaches life with a healthy compassion ("On Your Side") 
and handles loved ones with a sense of fair play ("Justice for Truth"). She can 
kick her imagination into high gear, ruminating on life in Moscow during the 
'30s ("Night Train to Leningrad") and hanging out with Earhart, Curie and 
Picasso ("Dinner With Gershwin"). In her quest for greater commercial impact, 
Russell sounds at moments like Donna Summer (who had a mini-hit in 1987 with 
"Gershwin"). Being that Summer should wish that she could come up with new 
music as unique as this, Russell's lapse into clone-country is her only misstep 
on an otherwise fine album. 
</P>
<P>
*** Lalah Hathaway, "Lalah Hathaway," Virgin. She's the daughter of the late 
Donny Hathaway, a singer-songwriter whose style was so nakedly emotional that 
he could make you feel like a voyeur to someone's private pain. There's nothing 
that searing or confessional about his 21-year-old offspring's music. She 
doesn't write, and the songs on her debut album are the kind of coolly 
sophisticated "quiet storm" fare that manages to woo you while keeping you at 
arm's distance. It's too soon to tell whether Hathaway has the distinctive 
scope and passion to make her the soul-music leader that her father was, but 
this record does serve as a solid introduction to a noteworthy young singer. 
</P>
<P>
** Five Star, "Five Star," Epic. While you can sense ambitious effort all over 
this album, it still doesn't feel like the hit that Five Star is clearly hoping 
will jump-start its career. "Hot Love" is a Prince-ly attempt at eroti-rock. 
"What About Me Baby?" is a decent attempt at power rock that would be at home 
in Joan Jett's or Lita Ford's repertoire. "Tienes Mi Amour" is appealing, 
though the vocals are so high-pitched that it sounds as if the group recorded 
it after a few hits of helium. None of this adds up to an album with much of a 
focus. When this black British pop group debuted with the hit single "All Fall 
Down" in 1986, it looked and sounded like one of the freshest, most promising 
young outfits around. Today, Five Star sounds like just another act that could 
use a few hits of inspiration.

SIDNEY WEISS PLAYS CONUS CONCERTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The musical bill of fare Thursday at Hollywood Bowl, where Lawrence Foster 
conducted the second of two programs this week, included two orchestral works 
of household-name familiarity -- as one expects during the summer -- and one 
obscure concerto. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian romanticist Julius Conus is remembered -- if at all -- for a single 
work: his Violin Concerto, first performed by the composer in 1898. The 
archives of the Los Angeles Philharmonic indicate but one previous local 
performance of the work; this took place 47 years ago. The artist/archeologist 
who excavated and performed the work on Thursday evening was the Philharmonic's 
own principal concertmaster, Sidney Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
The single-movement composition is a soloist's concerto -- the orchestra is 
truly subsidiary -- and it can sound much like a 21-minute technical exercise. 
One listened in vain for a memorable tune -- much less inventive orchestration 
or interesting counterpoint. If it is another half-century before the piece has 
another hearing in Cahuenga Pass, that will probably be fine with most of the 
8,015 who were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the work served as a suitable vehicle for Weiss to demonstrate his 
warm, radiant tone and technical prowess. His playing remained intense, urgent, 
and insofar as the limited score allowed, expressive. Foster and the 
Philharmonic provided consistent and effective support. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, the conductor turned to Dvorak's popular "New World" 
Symphony. Here the rapport between our orchestra and its erstwhile (1965-68) 
assistant conductor and frequent podium guest was much in evidence, as the 
musicians responded to the native Angeleno's ministrations with spirit and 
precision. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, as always, kept his gestures straightforward and economical, but shaped 
phrases with individuality and character, projected freshness and spontaneity, 
and elicited from the ensemble propulsive, energized playing. Technical 
problems were few and insignificant, and the woodwinds seemed to be in 
particularly fine form; Carolyn Hove's exquisite English horn solo in the Largo 
is but one example. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening work, Liszt's familiar "Les Preludes," the players gave Foster 
the same degree of alertness, and brought to their playing both vitality and 
sensitivity. The Philharmonic almost made the tiresome symphonic poem sound 
like a first-rate composition. TERRY McQUILKIN

HOME TECH / VIDEO: FIRMS PUTTING LOCAL ADS ON MOVIES FALTER; 
</P>
<P>
CASSETTES: A STRUGGLING COMPANY SAYS A LAWSUIT BY PARAMOUNT HAD ITS EFFECT, 
EVEN THOUGH A JUDGE RULED AGAINST THE STUDIO. ANOTHER FIRM COUNTERSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
What appeared to the a booming business last fall -- putting local ads on 
videotapes of hit movies -- apparently has gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
Two companies, Video Broadcasting Systems of Wichita, Kan., and Video Air Time, 
of Midland, Tex., were at the forefront of this local-ad movement. Both, 
though, are virtually out of business. 
</P>
<P>
What these video-ad sales firms did was make deals with video store owners to 
put commercials for local businesses on the blank tape at the beginning of 
rental movies. Since video companies like Paramount sell rental copies to video 
retailers, in theory the retailers are free to do what they want with the tapes 
-- including selling commercial space on them. Video retailers and the video-ad 
sales firms split the money paid by advertisers, while companies like Paramount 
and CBS-Fox got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Paramount filed a suit in a Kansas federal court against Video 
Broadcasting, mainly charging trademark infringement and the false creation of 
the image that Paramount approved these ads. Paramount wanted a ban on the 
local ads but the judge denied it. That should have meant clear sailing for 
companies like Video Broadcasting and Video Air Time to sell their local ads. 
</P>
<P>
But, Allen Frasier of Video Air Time explained, Paramount's intimidation 
tactics frightened away both advertisers and video retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Without any advertisers, said William Fry, attorney for VBS and also a former 
co-owner, VBS is just "limping along." Last week VBS filed a countersuit 
against Paramount, charging violation of antitrust laws and malicious 
interference with the company's contracts with advertisers, seeking $105 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's responded to all this with a prepared statement made through a 
spokesperson: "Except for VBS, the other original defendants have agreed to 
stop these practices. As we said all along, we choose what is placed on 
videocassettes very carefully. We brought this action originally to protect the 
quality and integrity of our product as it is sold or rented to consumers. We 
don't want them confused. We believe the court will dismiss VBS' frivolous 
claim." 
</P>
<P>
Putting ads on cassettes released by other companies is now almost impossible 
too, Fry said. These other companies have used tactics like cutting down on the 
amount of blank tape space at the beginning of movies and imprinting the 
company logo on all the tape preceding a movie -- so that adding a commercial 
would constitute trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount particularly objected to the tone and inferior quality of the ads and 
the fact that commercials were inappropriately matched to its movies, like a 
bar ad preceding the teen movie, "Pretty in Pink." Ads have been placed on 
Paramount videos such as "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Flashdance," 
"Crocodile Dundee II" and "Star Trek IV." 
</P>
<P>
All video manufacturers deplore the local video-ad business but only Paramount 
took legal action. Video companies weren't that concerned about lost revenues 
from local advertising but they feared renters might think they approved such 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
Also, these local ads conflict with the national ads that video manufacturers 
have already added to certain titles. But video companies, afraid of alienating 
renters, have put very few ads on movies. Paramount, for instance, has only put 
ads on six of its titles. The companies were afraid that rampant local 
commercials would ultimately turn off renters and damage the whole rental 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas has been the battleground for the video-ad conflict. But Texas' Video 
Air Time has indirectly suffered too. Video Air Time's president Allen Frasier, 
who said he once considered merging with Video Broadcasting, admitted that his 
company is largely out of the video-ad business. Though he blamed Paramount for 
Video Broadcasting's decline, Frasier said Paramount didn't do as much damage 
to his business as the depressed Texas economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertisers don't have much money in this part of the country," Frasier 
said. "We had to compete with cheap radio ads and cheap TV spots. Even if we 
could put all the local ads on videotapes we wanted to, we wouldn't have much 
business."

RAPE, REALITY EXAMINED IN 'TELLING TIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH

<TEXT>
<P>
Annie works at a library, and once a week she's the story lady. She weaves 
fantasies for the boys and girls. Then one day, she's raped. In Laura Shamas' 
"Telling Time" at West Coast Ensemble, that's only the beginning of the story. 
Annie's problems double. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, Annie can't face the reality. She sinks into her 
own fantasy world to blot out the awful truth of what's happened to her. Her 
gynecologist Monica becomes Glinda, the good witch of Oz, her mother Mrs. 
Nesbitt turns into a devilish Roman Catholic demon swathed in scarlet, with a 
mitered hat, and her best friend Cheryl appears to her as a giddy Snow White. 
Even her fiance Zach becomes a swashbuckling pirate. 
</P>
<P>
Well and good -- Annie is buffering herself and slowly weaving her way through 
her own emotional reconstruction. But Annie has yet to find out about the 
fantasy worlds of those closest to her, the fairy tales they all carry as 
emotional baggage when Annie finds out she's pregnant by her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
This, and not the rape, is the core of Shamas' play. Suddenly Annie is the only 
one facing her reality -- alone. An overbearingly solicitous Jeanette Miller, 
as the mother, believes the church and having the baby can solve all Annie's 
problems; her doctor, sensible but oh-so businesslike in Christy Barrett's 
reading, opts for abortion and backs it up with a $5,000 estimate for the 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Scott Allen, warm and sensitive as Zach, doesn't want his marriage plans 
upset, and Barbara Milan's best friend is honest but unfeeling. Annie's 
choices, after all, are Annie's choices, and the real-life fantasies of her 
circle no longer compute with the growing solidity of her own new reality. 
</P>
<P>
Under Allison Liddi's lucid direction, Kim Taylor as Annie reaches into both 
the storybook and real facets of Annie's trauma and evolves an honest, 
thoughtful portrait of a young woman coming of age. Liddi's staging, which uses 
the space to the fullest, is as fluid and natural as the performances. 
</P>
<P>
Approached here with insight and more than a little humor, a difficult subject 
becomes as simple as a children's story, but don't be fooled; though the author 
might have gone deeper, she provides some wisdom and maybe even a couple of 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
Sundays, 7 p.m.; indefinitely. $12.50; (213) 871-1052.

'SUPERSTAR' AT STARLIGHT BOWL RETAINS MEMORABLE QUALITY 
</P>

When "Jesus Christ Superstar" was first produced on Broadway 19 years ago, it 
caused picketing and protests by religious groups. A rock opera about the final 
days of Christ? A sympathetic portrait of Judas? A question about whether Jesus 
was a man or a god? 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine the stirring and beautifully sung production, in its 
Starlight Musical Theatre premiere at the Starlight Bowl, causing protests now. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is the inevitable softening effects of time. And an 
appreciation of Andrew Lloyd Webber, who made his first indelible imprint on 
the American consciousness with this score. 
</P>
<P>
And the very tone of the production has changed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The show was conceived by Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice as a portrayal of 
Christ as seen through the eyes of Judas and as a man, not a god. 
</P>
<P>
The original production used modern dress and a cross-cultural cast; it shocked 
some audiences with the raw edges it brought to one of the most famous stories 
ever told. An Asian played Mary Magdalene. A black played Judas in both the 
original Broadway and movie versions of the play. At Starlight, in a more 
seemingly self-conscious choice, the cast is cross-cultural, but Jesus, Judas 
and Mary are white. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest change in "Jesus Christ Superstar" here is one in emphasis -- 
one that will please some and disappoint others. Judas' point of view is muted. 
It is easy here to reject him out of hand as a non-believer rather than to 
sympathize with him as the one man in a band of dreamers who anticipated and 
feared the disaster that would follow when a Jewish leader -- Jesus -- became a 
superstar ripe for the crushing in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Still what cannot help to please all is the powerful, pulsating and majestic 
music, performed operatically with no dialogue between songs, except for a 
handful of lines at the crucifixion scene. For most in the packed house, the 
music even overpowered the frequent planes that roar over the Starlight Bowl on 
their way to Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Amick Byram is compelling and sweet-voiced as Jesus and soars in the song, 
"Gethsemane," in which he questions his destiny. As Judas, Jesse Corti lacks 
force in his early soul-searching scenes of indecision, but seems to grow in 
power after Judas decides to make his betrayal; his final song, "I Don't Know 
How to Love Him," is wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Saffran's Mary Magdalene sings like an angel. There is no toughness 
of the one-time prostitute here, but you get a rich, full, sensuous voice and a 
face that you hate to see step out of the spotlight for even a moment. 
</P>
<P>
P. L. Brown brings dramatic fury to the role of Caiaphas, the leader determined 
to bring Jesus to trial. Jae Ross captures the torment of Pontius Pilate, who 
doesn't want to be the one with blood on his hands but, in the end, gives into 
the rising hysteria of the crowd that demands the crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Machray is the much-needed comic relief as King Herod, the king who 
mocks Jesus. When Reggie Phoenix sings the part of Simon Zealotes, you can hear 
the restlessness of a land of have-nots looking for a leader to liberate them. 
</P>
<P>
The current production favors biblical costumes (by Ray Delle Robbins), and the 
tone is distinctly reverential. The direction by James Rocco, who also 
choreographed the piece, moves from religious tableau to tableau. 
</P>
<P>
In all the attention given to Lloyd Webber, people often forget that in the 
absence of a book, it is Tim Rice's intelligent, sometimes sardonic and often 
passionate lyrics that bring the story unforgettably up to date. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in retrospect, it was "Jesus Christ Superstar" that catapulted Lloyd 
Webber to stardom. Not only did it spur a revival of his earlier effort "Joseph 
and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," but it precipitated how pop opera was 
to take over Broadway in the form of "Evita," "Cats," "Starlight Express" and 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
But never mind Broadway. If anybody doubts that Lloyd Webber's music taps into 
something irresistible in the local common consciousness, take a look at the 
box office for tonight's SummerPops performance of the music of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sellout. 
</P>
<P>

ABCS OF CHILD-PROOFING KITCHEN, BATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Home safety doesn't happen by accident. 
</P>
<P>
While no one can foresee a child being injured in the kitchen or bathroom -- 
two of a home's more hazard-fraught rooms -- everyone can take steps to lessen 
potential perils. Most of these measures are common sense, but Kitchen and Bath 
Ideas magazine says it pays to review. 
</P>
<P>
These safety guidelines apply to both the kitchen and bathroom: 
</P>
<P>
Store liquor, chemicals, cleaners and medicines in upper cabinets out of 
children's sight. And lock the cabinets -- children can climb. Buy potentially 
lethal products in child-resistant packaging only. 
</P>
<P>
Latch cabinets where garbage and plastic garbage bags are kept. 
</P>
<P>
All cabinet doors and drawers should have safety stops. Knobs should be too 
large for a child to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Provide safe storage for sharp objects, such as knives and fingernail files. 
</P>
<P>
Install slip-resistant flooring and make sure that scatter rugs have non-slip 
backings. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminate or cover sharp corners, such as on counters and tables. 
</P>
<P>
Place all electric outlets, or at least those near water sources, on a ground 
fault circuit interrupter. 
</P>
<P>
Cover electric outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Stay away from water sources when using small appliances. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid burns, set the water temperature no higher than 120 degrees. Water 
heated to 156 degrees can cause a third-degree burn in only one second. 
</P>
<P>
Install smoke detectors and place a fire extinguisher near the exit. If 
building or remodeling, consider installing a sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
Install windows and mirrors with protective film that prevents shards from 
flying when broken. 
</P>
<P>
Windows, especially those on upper floors, should feature hardware that limits 
how far they open. 
</P>
<P>
Keep cords for draperies and mini blinds out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure interiors are well lighted. 
</P>
<P>
Keep lamp cords hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Until children are older, put away knickknacks that are small enough to pose a 
choking hazard. 
</P>
<P>
To spot potential dangers to small children in the kitchen, or any room, 
consider the space from their point of view. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Buy a stove with controls on top, not on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Turn handles of pots away from the edge of the stove when cooking. And, install 
a pot guardrail on the front edge of the stove. 
</P>
<P>
Keep small appliances stored and latched in upper cabinets or in an appliance 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let appliance cords dangle from countertops when in use. Unplug 
appliances not in use. 
</P>
<P>
Always install a latch on a deep freezer. Latches are also available for 
refrigerator doors. 
</P>
<P>
Children love to play in and around water, but child's play can lead to mishaps 
without the following precautions: 
</P>
<P>
Never leave a child unattended in the bathroom, not even for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Because children can drown in very small amounts of water, install latches on 
all toilet lids. 
</P>
<P>
Install grab bars in the tub and shower. Faucet parts should be shatter 
resistant and have no sharp edges. 
</P>
<P>
Provide a sturdy step stool to raise children high enough to easily reach 
faucets and countertops. 
</P>
<P>
Install hardware on the bathroom door that can be unlocked from either side of 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent children from entering the bathroom unsupervised, keep the door 
closed. Also, cover the knob with a safety sleeve that requires an adult grip 
to open.

LIGHT, TASTEFUL SATELLITE DISHES ON THE HORIZON FOR TV VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally, satellite dishes have been something of a blight on homeowners' 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-foot dishes that come to mind are expensive, cumbersome and can't easily 
be set up for someone who lives in an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
But that situation may be on the verge of changing. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium called Sky Cable -- which includes NBC, Cablevision Systems and 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., to name a few -- is studying new technology that, 
perhaps by 1993, might enable people to clip satellite dishes the size of 
laptop computers outside their windows. In fact, these dishes that won't even 
look like dishes offer better reception and more programming choices than 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
Called squarials, these flat antennas, 12 inches on a side, may be possible 
because the satellites that send the signals will be more powerful. Satellites 
proposed for the future will carry 200-watt transmitters. With this kind of 
power, the receiving dish need not be as large as in the past. Traditional 
dishes require large reflective surfaces that can capture enough of today's 
low-powered signals to produce adequately strong images. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Cable, tentatively boasting 108 channels, would offer perfect reception 
without any troublesome cables. This is all due to new transmission techniques 
the company is working on. 
</P>
<P>
The antenna and receiver are expected to cost about $300 when the system is 
introduced in the United States. No date has been set for when this will 
happen. The system is touted as a supplement to both cable and regular 
broadcast TV. The major networks have no intention of putting their programs on 
the satellite.

BASIC CARE KEEPS POOL IN THE SWIM; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: ROUTINE MAINTENANCE CAN ENSURE SAFETY AND CLEANLINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An over-ground pool can provide hours of fun and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a checklist of basic maintenance steps to help keep your pool safe and 
clean: 
</P>
<P>
The first time you fill your pool, take a quart of water from about 18 inches 
below the surface and have a pool dealer analyze it. The dealer will recommend 
an initial stabilizing treatment and the correct long-range treatment to keep 
the pool chemically stabilized. Have the water analyzed again at the start of 
each swimming season and whenever water problems occur. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a chlorine and pH (acidity/alkalinity balance) test kit. Test the water 
daily for the first two weeks of the season; twice a week thereafter is 
probably enough. Maintain a chlorine residual level of 1 to 2 parts per million 
(p.p.m.) and a pH of 7.4 to 7.6. An incorrect pH reduces the chlorine's 
efficiency and can damage the pool liner. Follow label directions when adding 
pH adjusters or any chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Use stabilized organic chlorine to sanitize the pool water. The most effective 
form of chlorine is solid pellets fed continuously into the water from a 
dispenser; powdered chlorine must be added by hand every day or two. 
</P>
<P>
To neutralize organic wastes, super-chlorinate the pool every two weeks, 
preferably in the evening. Add a commercial oxidizer or five to 10 times the 
normal daily dose of powdered chlorine (the residual level should be 10 
p.p.m.), then run the pump overnight. Stay out of the pool for 12 hours. Add an 
algae inhibitor to the pool every two weeks, preferably the morning after the 
oxidizing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
To filter out sand, dirt and other solids, run the pump as often and as long as 
it takes to clarify the water (experience and your pool dealer will help you 
determine how long is necessary). Check the pressure gauge daily. If the 
pressure in the sand filter exceeds the level recommended by the filter 
manufacturer, back-flush the filter according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, clean the pool surface with a leaf net, brush down the liner and 
vacuum as needed. Periodically clean the skimmer's catch basket. With the pump 
off, remove and clean the hair and lint filter. Repair chipped paint or rust 
spots on frames or steel walls. Fix liner leaks with a pool-patching kit. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to close the pool at the end of the season, treat the water with a 
winterizing kit. Clean the pool and back-flush the filter. Drain the pool to 
about four inches below the skimmer. Drain the water from the pump and filter 
and store them indoors. Cover the pool with a mesh or solid cover.

CLEVER TOUCHES CAN TRANSFORM HOME; 
</P>
<P>
REDESIGN: THE RIGHT FURNISHINGS AND CLEVER USE OF COLOR AND ARTWORK CAN DO MORE 
TO REDECORATE AN INTERIOR THAN ANY ARCHITECT -- AND FOR FAR LESS THE COST.

It's amazing what paint, floor coverings and some lively furniture can do for a 
house. As legions of energetic people are proving all over the country, redoing 
a handyman's special is still the fastest -- and often the only affordable -- 
route to satisfying home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Take Richard Marencic, 31, and Sarah Vogt, 29, of Philadelphia. This married 
couple bought a modest row house slightly outside the city center for $64,000. 
Without spending a lot more -- only about $20,000 over five years -- they won a 
contest sponsored by Philadelphia Magazine for their imaginative furnishings 
and setting. 
</P>
<P>
Marencic, a 1981 graduate of the University of Michigan's design school, and 
Vogt, a fine arts graduate of Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, chose the 
small three-bedroom row house in a working class neighborhood near the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art because it was convenient and they could afford it, 
with a little financial help from his father. 
</P>
<P>
Though the house contains only about 1,200 square feet, excluding the basement, 
it has room for a studio for each. The location is convenient to Vogt's job as 
assistant manager of the Philadelphia museum store and Marencic's job as an 
interior designer with Daroff Design Inc. What it needed most was a large 
helping of style. 
</P>
<P>
As a designer, Marencic was able to come up with a number of inexpensive but 
stylish stratagems. The couple hired a contractor to handle technical matters, 
then did some of the work themselves to save money. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they have replaced virtually all surfaces on the first floor, fixed a 
leaky roof, removed partitions, old flooring and wall coverings, redone 
ceilings and upgraded plumbing and electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea is to use furnishings rather than architecture to create interest in 
the house. As designers we enjoy being able to change the looks of our rooms," 
says Marencic, who is a co-founder of Tabula Rasa, a local group of architects 
and artists who exhibit their artwork and are interested in interrelationships 
among various media. 
</P>
<P>
Marencic designed and built the dining room table, two etageres, two dining 
chairs and a number of art constructions. Virtually all the art objects and 
framed art in the house was made by the couple or their friends. 
</P>
<P>
As designers, they enjoy combining many different styles. They updated old 
things with new colors or fabrics. For example, some boxy, blond, sun-porch 
furniture from the 1950s has been given a new twist with a jazzy new fabric 
that looks a bit like a Jackson Pollock canvas with its abstract mix of purple, 
magenta, green, black and white blotches. 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, their house is almost identical to the others in the row. It 
has an indoor porch, living room, separate dining room, kitchen and small back 
deck on the first floor. The deck was rotten and had to be replaced -- a 
project they planned jointly with their next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Marencic provided the design: wooden planks laid on the diagonal and a privacy 
screen made of strips of wood to create the illusion of more space. A small 
round table with two chairs, a barbecue grill, and several small containers 
filled with flowering annuals make it a pleasant spot for Sunday breakfast or 
an afternoon snack. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the floor plan no longer resembles those of neighboring houses. There 
is a clear view from kitchen to sun porch, with most obstructing walls taken 
down. Those that are left have been painted white. A black and white scheme 
predominates. 
</P>
<P>
For the kitchen, the couple purchased self-assembly furniture -- inexpensive 
white cabinetry with simple U-shaped hardware. Black laminate countertops have 
been installed. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen layout has been slightly rearranged to make room for a large 
peninsula that surrounds the sink. Perched on a stool at this counter, used for 
quick meals and as a buffet surface for parties, one can see through to the sun 
porch. The floor has been covered with a rosy terra cotta tile. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the house the basic black and white background has been enlivened 
with a range of Memphis-inspired colors such as aqua, rose and purple. 
</P>
<P>
Marencic's furniture designs, too, are inspired by the funky Memphis look with 
its odd angles and curves. His enjoyment of the offbeat also is evident in the 
window coverings -- translucent plexiglass screens that he sanded for privacy. 
Small triangular cutouts create a peekaboo effect that amuses him. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had a pleasant surprise when they removed existing shag carpeting: 
oak flooring. They finished it by buffing.

Children of the Night, known nationally for helping youthful runaways and 
streetwalkers escape Hollywood's seedy boulevards, is closing its Hollywood 
office and moving to the suburbs, a move that reflects the district's decline 
as a center of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's move to Van Nuys in a week follows the migration of 
prostitution to the suburbs as well as the institutionalization of Children of 
the Night, started by chance in 1979 by Lois Lee. Then a graduate student in 
sociology, Lee is now a favorite of talk show hosts plumbing the sensational 
stories of teen-age prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Lee began her effort to help wayward youths in Hollywood by giving brief refuge 
in her apartment to some of the teen-age prostitutes she met while conducting 
her research. By the start of next year, she will preside over an organization 
that will have grown to include a 24-bed shelter in a refurbished Van Nuys post 
office, a $1-million annual budget and a full-time staff of 22 devoted to the 
shelter, street counseling, administrative duties and a 24-hour telephone hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lee began documenting prostitution for her dissertation more than a 
decade ago, police and community crackdowns have forced many pimps and 
prostitutes to move on -- to escort services, massage services and to other 
arenas, including suburban communities in Orange County and the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the Sunset Boulevard of 400 to 500 prostitutes (a decade ago)," said 
Los Angeles Police Lt. Pete Durham of the Hollywood Division's vice squad. "Now 
I'll buy you a steak dinner if I can find 20 prostitutes on the boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
With the opportunity in Van Nuys to set up its first shelter, and fewer youths 
in need of counseling services in Hollywood, "it makes so little sense to stay 
here," Lee said. "In the last two years we haven't pulled a lot of kids out of 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, when Children of the Night started leasing space in an office 
high-rise at Highland and Franklin avenues, it helped 500 youths. Last year, 
143 new youngsters went to the Hollywood center, out of the 801 children the 
program dealt with altogether. The rest were either callers to the hot line or 
youngsters associated with the program from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"The pimps are skipping Hollywood altogether," said Lee, a fast-talking, 
media-wise 39-year-old whose experiences with Children of the Night were turned 
into a TV movie five years ago. "They're going to Orange County, San Diego, 
Hawaii, Alaska." And, no, Lee laughs, her staff counselors are not going to 
Hawaii, but they do hit streets in Orange and San Diego counties and next year 
plan to branch out to the Bay Area and Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Children of the Night will also continue to send counselors to Hollywood, which 
for all its tawdriness remains something of a magnet for young runaways with 
stars in their eyes. This week Lee's staff put a 13-year-old girl on a flight 
home to Spokane, Wash., from which she had run away last year with friends, 
escaping, she said, a sexually abusive stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had arrived in Hollywood at the age of 12 "because she wanted to be a 
star," as another youngster in Lee's office explained, and wound up living with 
a man in exchange for sex. Apparently tired of her, the man called Children of 
the Night. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics trace a dramatic drop in prostitution during the 1980s as 
officers, responding to community complaints, stepped up patrols and arrests in 
Hollywood. In the first seven months of this year, Los Angeles police say the 
Hollywood Division made 1,033 prostitution arrests of both males and females, 
compared to slightly more than double that during the same period in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some of the offenders have turned up in suburban areas where 
they had been rarely seen before. "We had a big prostitution problem last 
summer for the first time ever in this city," said Sgt. Tom Boylan of the Costa 
Mesa Police Department. "One reason is there's a lot of money to be made out 
here and police in Hollywood are cracking down, so girls found it easier to 
come out here for a while. They move around a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, police say prostitutes started showing up in strength on 
Harbor Boulevard, a commercial strip that runs from Costa Mesa to La Habra, 
after the push to clean up Los Angeles for the 1984 Olympics. A few years 
later, the problem had become so pronounced that the FBI was investigating it, 
and today police say the stepped-up enforcement has driven streetwalkers from 
many Orange County communities. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to a suburban migration of prostitution, Lee suggested, is 
urban violence. "With the gangs moving into Hollywood, it makes it very 
difficult. You don't want to put girls on the street where they're going to be 
beaten up and raped and robbed." 
</P>
<P>
Children of the Night's Van Nuys shelter, scheduled to open around Christmas in 
a renovated post office purchased for $899,000 in cash, realizes Lee's 
long-held dream that the program have a shelter of its own. Finding bed space 
is not easy, especially for young hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Lee called around looking for a place to send the 13-year-old for 
the night, she found no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Lee insists the move to Van Nuys is not an abandonment of Hollywood but an 
expansion to a building where 11- to 17-year-old boys and girls who are 
sexually abused, in prostitution or pornography can return to normal lives in a 
quieter, less tempting setting. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys, a community with its own prostitution problem, seems to have no 
qualms about the arrival of Children of the Night, which is renting a house 
there for its operation until the shelter is ready. "People have really 
welcomed us in the area. I've been invited to join the Chamber of Commerce," 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
In the new facility, the staff will not only house and feed up to 24 
youngsters, it will also provide counseling and a classroom, where high school 
equivalency instruction will be offered, and the staff will man its 24-hour hot 
line and do administrative work. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the organization in October will operate a new toll-free number in 
California and is expanding its emergency transportation program for youngsters 
in need of immediate help. 
</P>
<P>
"We were poor for so long," says Lee. She eschews government funding -- "I want 
flexibility" -- and instead operates on private donations from sources ranging 
from heavy metal groups to the Lawrence Welk Foundation.

U.S. ACTS ON NATIONWIDE FEE SCHEDULE FOR MEDICARE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PROPOSAL IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A SCALE FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. THE 
FINAL PLAN IS TO TAKE EFFECT IN 1992.

<P>
In a historic move, the Bush Administration on Friday sent Congress a proposed 
drastic revision in Medicare fees -- the first step toward establishing a 
nationwide fee scale covering more than 7,000 physician services from X-rays to 
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The model price schedule would pay internists more and surgeons somewhat less 
than they currently receive for certain procedures, and would narrow the income 
gap between rural doctors and their big-city colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, the precise and detailed fee schedule would take effect in 
January, 1992, establishing unprecedented government control over the bills 
that are charged by the 500,000 physicians who treat Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would apply only to cases involving Medicare patients, the 
government fee schedule would be almost certain to have an influence on fees 
charged by physicians for other patients as well. 
</P>
<P>
Louis H. Sullivan, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
said the move to a nationwide fee scale for Medicare would mark "the most 
wide-ranging and fundamental changes in Medicare's physician payment system" 
since the program began in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the Medicare 
program, predicted the move would produce major shifts in income among various 
groups of doctors and that some would find their incomes reduced as much as 15% 
to 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the new system will give surgeons less than they currently receive, 
while internists will get more. And the government will pay more for office 
visits, but less than it does now for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Wilensky, the Health Care Financing Administration's chief, said that 
whenever practical, the new system will shift patients to primary-care 
services, such as office visits and consultations, and away from expensive 
procedures such as surgery. 
</P>
<P>
It also is expected to provide the federal government with a powerful tool to 
help hold down medical costs, which have been skyrocketing in recent years with 
the onset of new technology and more sweeping health-insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
After 1992, the new law also will enable the secretary of Health and Human 
Services to squeeze medical payments, in an effort to control Medicare 
spending, by establishing an overall national target for total Medicare outlays 
for doctor bills. 
</P>
<P>
If actual outlays exceed that target, the secretary can reduce reimbursements 
for particular procedures the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Wilensky said the new system also would reduce the wide variation in fees 
between urban and rural areas, increasing payments for many physicians in rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Medicare payments are determined by a confusing and complex system 
in which the amount the government agrees to pay is linked to the fees that a 
particular physician has charged in the past and to the fees that seem to 
prevail in his community. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare generally pays 80% of the so-called local reasonable and customary fee 
for the particular service, but a physician may charge more than that, and the 
patient is responsible for paying the difference. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the current system produces wide differences in fees, both among 
medical specialties and among individual localities. 
</P>
<P>
Congress last year approved legislation requiring the creation of a single fee 
schedule that would provide the same payment to all doctors for performing the 
same procedure -- with some minor adjustments for local variations in office 
costs and malpractice insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the federal government will -- for the first time in history 
-- be able to direct precisely how much a doctor can charge for each specific 
treatment given to Medicare beneficiaries, that is, people over age 65 and the 
disabled of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Among the various fees proposed under the model schedule disclosed on Friday 
are $61.80 for a comprehensive office visit for a new patient; $263.30 for 
removal of a breast lesion and $2,264.20 for total replacement of a hip. 
</P>
<P>
The listing sets a fee of $266.90 for catheterization of the right side of the 
heart. In all, the schedule covers some 1,400 services that make up two-thirds 
of all Medicare procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Congress made public on Friday, Sullivan cautioned that, for 
now, the fees "are very preliminary and should be used as illustrative only." 
</P>
<P>
"We are inviting physicians and other interested parties to evaluate and 
comment on the model fee schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the preliminary fees in Friday's listing will be refined 
during the coming year, and the Health and Human Services Department will 
develop standard charges for other Medicare services that have not been covered 
in the new fee schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"This approach underlines our earnest desire to solicit the views and build on 
the experience of physicians, beneficiary groups and others in the public to 
produce a Medicare fee schedule that is workable and fair," Sullivan said.

TWO GERMANYS SIGN TREATY ON UNIFICATION

<P>
With broad smiles and repeated references to the historical significance of the 
moment, representatives of the two Germanys on Friday signed the treaty that 
provides the legal basis for political unification on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations as tough and protracted as any in diplomatic memory were required 
to produce the 1,000-page document, and the result was regarded on both sides 
as a remarkable achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"This treaty is without question one of the most meaningful documents in 
postwar German history," East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere declared 
at the signing ceremony in the 17th-Century Unter den Linden Palace. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who in 32 days will become the first leader 
of all the Germans since Adolf Hitler, hailed the treaty as "a document of the 
highest historical importance." 
</P>
<P>
Its acceptance, after agreement in July on a treaty dealing with economic 
matters, completes the major diplomatic work on the internal aspects of 
unification. Ratification by the two German parliaments is expected to be 
routine and to take place in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the international elements of German unification is expected to be 
achieved on Sept. 12 at a meeting in Moscow of the two Germanys and the four 
principal World War II Allies, the United States, Britain, France and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty signed Friday spells the end of the East German state that was 
created in October, 1949, out of the Soviet zone of occupied Germany. Two weeks 
short of its 41st birthday, and just under 11 months after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, the East Berlin government and the state it rules ceases to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Until elections for an all-German Parliament, scheduled for Dec. 2, 144 of the 
400 members of the East German Volkskammer will sit in the West German 
Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere took note of the hardships and uncertainties facing many in East 
Germany as the first steps are taken to overhaul its obsolete, centrally 
planned economy, and he warned his people not to look for any immediate relief 
from Friday's treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with this unity treaty, all our budding dreams won't come true 
immediately," he said. "But we are now on the right path. The prospects for the 
future are realistic and more favorable than at any time since the end of the 
war. We shouldn't forget that." 
</P>
<P>
The treaty covers a broad range of affairs, from education, finance and 
international sports to postal regulations and the rights of civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
Reconciling the two countries' laws on abortion -- East Germany's is liberal, 
West Germany's very strict -- had held up the treaty talks for nearly a week, 
until a compromise was struck that permits both laws to remain in force in 
their respective regions while new, all-German legislation is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty covers the following also: 
</P>
<P>
Berlin will be the capital of united Germany, but the question of where the new 
Parliament and government are to function is left open. The wording reflects 
the position, held in West Germany throughout the postwar era, that unification 
would return the capital to Berlin. Yet it also accommodates growing pressure 
from powerful, populous West German states to keep the capital in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
States such as Bavaria and North-Rhine Westphalia, where Bonn is situated and 
which has a population equal to that of East Germany, fear an erosion of their 
power if the capital moves so far east. This question of the site of the 
government is expected to produce one of the first major debates in the unified 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 3, the day of unification, is designated as Germany's national day, 
settling a question that had persisted for months, reflecting the uncertainty 
of national identity and tortured memories of the Nazi past. 
</P>
<P>
Some had argued for Nov. 9, the day the Berlin Wall fell, but that was rejected 
because Nov. 3 is the date of Kristallnacht, in 1938, when Nazi toughs 
ransacked Jewish property throughout the country in an ominous prelude to the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Others, mainly on the political left, had proposed May 8, the anniversary of 
the Nazi collapse in 1945, but that too received only limited support. 
</P>
<P>
Priorities are established for what is expected to be an avalanche of legal 
disputes over property in East Germany that had been owned by families now 
living in the West but was confiscated by the Communists and handed over to 
East German families, many of whom have been in residence for the better part 
of two generations. 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, the treaty provides for reparations to be paid by the state, 
rather than restoration of ownership. By using this formula, the negotiators 
hoped to remove the financial uncertainty that has slowed Western business 
investment in the East. 
</P>
<P>
A legal framework is outlined for merging the military and diplomatic services. 
Senior East German military officers and diplomats are likely to lose their 
posts and be retrained for non-government employment. The East German civil 
service, 2 million strong, is likely to be reduced by 600,000. 
</P>
<P>
A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said it is likely that "fewer than a 
hundred" East German diplomats will be retained in the diplomatic corps. At 
present, the two countries have roughly 6,500 diplomats each. 
</P>
<P>
An official at the West German Defense Ministry in Bonn said plans are already 
being formulated for the dismissal of most senior East Germany military 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,500 officers of the West German Bundeswehr are expected to be 
integrated into the East German Volksarmee, taking over most assignments above 
the level of battalion commander. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the East German officers "will be demobilized and retrained for jobs in 
civilian life," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials said that the level of political commitment required of 
senior military officers and diplomats by the former Communist government left 
them too tainted to serve a democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Heinz Galinski, criticized the 
negotiators and condemned Kohl for failing to follow through on a commitment to 
include a treaty provision recognizing the moral debt of united Germany to the 
victims of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our failure to convince those in political power of the need for a reference 
acknowledging the criminal past fills me with pain and worry," Galinski said in 
a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
But there were few other expressions of dissent. The West German interior 
minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who negotiated and signed the treaty for the Bonn 
government, captured the jubilant mood at the signing ceremony when he said: 
"This treaty is a victory for all Germans. Perhaps our neighbors see it better 
from a distance than we do here, but the future will prove this."

U.S. TO VOID EGYPT DEBT; WEIGHS BIG ARMS SALE TO ISRAEL; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: CANCELLATION OF $7.1 BILLION THAT CAIRO OWES WOULD REWARD IT FOR 
SUPPORT IN THE GULF. AN EARLY BUSH-GORBACHEV SUMMIT IS BEING CONSIDERED.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a flurry of diplomatic maneuvers surrounding the confrontation with Iraq, 
President Bush has agreed to cancel $7.1 billion in debts Egypt owes the United 
States for military equipment, is considering a massive new sale of weapons to 
Israel and may meet within the week with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
Administration officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. officials said Bush has decided to warn Jordan, gently 
but firmly, that it may jeopardize some of the aid it receives from the United 
States and other Western industrialized countries unless it takes a firmer 
stand against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to send the message to Jordan's King Hussein through a high-level 
delegation, probably headed by Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M. 
Gates, which will visit Amman, Jordan's capital. 
</P>
<P>
The moves come as Bush continues to try to tighten the economic noose on Iraq 
and persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to negotiate an end to the standoff 
in the Persian Gulf on Washington's terms. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the latest moves serves a different part of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Forgiveness of Egypt's massive military debt to the United States would be a 
major reward for Cairo's support for the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq and 
the huge U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As the largest of the Arab nations and the one that has put the largest group 
of troops alongside American forces in Saudi Arabia, Egypt's support for the 
U.S.-led campaign against Iraq is crucial, U.S. officials say. At the same 
time, Egypt has borne a heavy burden from the embargo because hundreds of 
thousands of its citizens have been employed in Iraq and Kuwait. Many of them 
are now refugees, and the country will both lose the earnings it had expected 
they would send home and pick up the burden of supporting a large additional 
group of unemployed workers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to forgive Egypt's military debt will substantially help Egypt's 
budget problems. Bush made the decision at his vacation home here after talking 
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak by telephone Thursday afternoon. The move 
is expected to be the first of several such gestures that Washington is 
considering for Middle East countries that have supported the U.S. effort. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt receives about $2.3 billion in U.S. aid each year, of which approximately 
$1.3 billion is in military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, meanwhile, receives roughly $3 billion in U.S. aid each year, of which 
roughly $1.8 billion is military aid and $1.2 billion is economic assistance. 
According to Administration sources, Israeli leaders over the last several days 
have asked for a major increase in the military part of that aid. Heading 
Israel's shopping list are new anti-missile defense systems that could add to 
the country's protection against possible Iraqi chemical attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Israel also has asked for new tanks and planes that would offset the additional 
weapons the United States has now promised to send to Saudi Arabia. At least 
some Administration officials are known to be skeptical of that idea, fearing 
that it would merely set off a major new arms race in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The possible Soviet summit is seen as a strong signal to Iraq of superpower 
unity. Early Friday, White House officials flatly denied rumors, emanating from 
Moscow, that a summit was in the works and could be held as early as next 
Saturday. By the end of the day, however, officials had backed away from those 
denials and were telling reporters to prepare for possible announcements of 
news today. 
</P>
<P>
As for the mission to Jordan, Washington wants King Hussein to cut off the 
traffic still going to Iraq through his own country and to halt food shipments 
to Baghdad from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the king has said he would honor the U.N.-imposed embargo, he has been 
highly critical of the U.S. troop deployment in the region, and trucks carrying 
supplies have continued to cross the nation's border into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, one of the poorest nations in the Middle East, has suffered severe 
economic losses from restricted trade with Iraq since the U.N. sanctions were 
approved early last month. The nation also has had to shoulder the burden of 
tens of thousands of refugees who have fled there from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush phoned a series of foreign leaders Friday, including British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and 
Saudi Arabian King Fahd, as he sought to shore up support for his plan to share 
the mounting costs of the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In public, Administration officials continued to praise the efforts made to 
date by other governments, such as Japan, to help support the American-led 
efforts to roll back Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. U.S. officials are eager to 
avoid public disputes that could shatter the international consensus so 
carefully nurtured over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
But privately, U.S. officials made it plain that they intend to ask for more 
help from abroad than has been offered so far. The Administration's appeals are 
aimed at Japan, West Germany, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates and the exiled government of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, shortly after a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry ruled 
out any increase in the $1 billion Japan has already promised for the 
multinational forces in the Mideast, a State Department official bluntly 
predicted that the Japanese spokesman will be proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, we still need more (aid from Japan)," this official said. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, both Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady will be traveling overseas to talk with foreign officials 
about the mounting expenses of the Persian Gulf operations. Baker will make 
several stops in Europe and the Mideast, while Brady will visit Japan and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, Bush, according to aides, has spoken with eight foreign 
heads of state to try to coordinate financial aid plans and the international 
effort to impose economic sanctions on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
White House and State Department officials leave no doubt that the 
Administration is happier with some countries' response than with others. 
Administration officials were particularly effusive in their praise for 
Mitterrand, telling reporters about the "positive tone" in relations between 
France and the United States.

The French have sent the second-most-powerful naval contingent to Middle 
Eastern waters after the American flotilla. And despite early suggestions that 
the French thought Bush was moving too quickly toward a military confrontation 
with Iraq, officials now say France is "strongly on board" in support of the 
international anti-Iraq effort. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, officials here offered few comments about West Germany's efforts. 
Before the current crisis began, U.S. officials were making much of the new 
strategic cooperation between Washington and Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
But White House officials now take a less optimistic view, reflecting the 
recognition on both sides of the Atlantic that the political and economic costs 
of German unification will severely constrain the merged nation's ability to 
contribute to allied efforts outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Friday, two congressional delegations left Washington for the Middle 
East, where they planned to talk with Mubarak, Saudi and Kuwaiti officials and 
U.S. troops and military commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will return to regular session next week, and several committees are 
planning hearings on the Administration's policies in the gulf. Baker will 
testify Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Wednesday before 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed that the 
United States is keeping a war crimes file on violations of international law 
by Saddam Hussein, as was reported Friday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of course very concerned about Iraq's violations of international law, 
including the taking of hostages and the use of civilians as a shield against 
military operations," Tutwiler said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the normal policy of the United States government to maintain files on 
possible violations of the law of war involving American citizens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the American who died this week in Iraq was identified by his 
family as banker James L. Worthington Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington, 53, a native of Marathon, Tex., died Monday, his daughter told the 
Daily Freeman of Kingston, N.Y. "He was taken hostage in Kuwait and moved to 
Basra where he died of a heart attack," said Maggie Jean Neilson, 27, of 
Woodstock, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington had been working as a consultant for the Alahi Bank of Kuwait.

GROUP HAS FACED UNPRECEDENTED THREATS TO ITS LONG HOLD OVER THE GOVERNMENT.

<P>
Over the next three days, the party that has ruled Mexico for 61 years will 
attempt to re-invent itself, at least enough to present a new face to voters in 
next year's congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,500 delegates to the 14th National Convention of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI from its initials in Spanish, are charged 
with restoring the party's slipping fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the PRI has faced unprecedented challenges to its 
authority, winning a presidential election by the narrowest margin in its 
history and losing its first gubernatorial race. State and local elections have 
resulted in violence as opponents angrily charged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an economic reform program based on austerity has continued to erode 
the spending power of Mexicans. Union members, the foot soldiers of the PRI, 
have been among the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
"The party has become an albatross around the government's neck," said Adrian 
LaJous, a political observer and former government official. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials do not go that far but do acknowledge the need for change. 
</P>
<P>
"We need far-reaching reforms," Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI executive committee 
president, told reporters earlier this week. "We need a new PRI for the new 
Mexican society." 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether those reforms can come from the convention that starts 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a show to make cosmetic changes," said LaJous. "I don't think it's 
possible to have an official party and have it be independent of the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the PRI has been the government's vote-gathering machine, a 
broad coalition of labor unions, farm organizations and the so-called popular 
sector, anyone who did not fit into the other two categories. Party members 
channeled their complaints and their requests through their sector, or interest 
group, to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the PRI is trying to distinguish itself from the government. In Colosio's 
words, "We want to give the party its own voice and initiative." 
</P>
<P>
One tactic being proposed is to orient the party more toward geographical 
regions, encouraging members to work in their region as well as their interest 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"The party cannot stop being a party (made up) of organizations," Colosio said. 
However, it can recognize regional differences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Colosio has also tried to broaden the appeal of the party, inviting 
entrepreneurs to join and issuing invitations to dissident party members to 
attend the convention. 
</P>
<P>
That effort largely backfired as Fidel Velasquez, the 90-year-old leader of the 
labor movement and a party stalwart, made it clear that he did not welcome 
those groups. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez's comments were an important factor in one dissident group's decision 
not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We all remember what happened at the last convention, when dissenting members 
were not allowed to speak," said Ramiro De la Rosa, a member of the 
coordinating committee of the dissident group, called the Critical Current. 
</P>
<P>
The last convention's dissidents were eventually forced out of the party and 
went on to form the core of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), which has 
presented major electoral challenges to the PRI over the last two years. Many 
Mexicans believe that the dissidents, led by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, actually won 
the 1988 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining dissidents do not want to be forced out of the PRI, especially at 
a convention that they do not believe will produce any real reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to come out of this convention looking as if they have made the 
party more democratic," said De la Rosa. "But their worry is not democracy, it 
is winning the next election."

COLD WAR LINGERS IN FEUD OVER ISLANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
As tumultuous political and economic change swept through the Soviet Union over 
the last year, there was one notable Cold War holdover in Moscow's foreign 
policy: a 45-year-old diplomatic stand-off with its neighbor to the east, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has been similarly reluctant to revise its thinking about the Soviet 
Union, insisting that a protracted territorial dispute over a group of islands 
off Hokkaido must be the focal point of chilly relations. 
</P>
<P>
But with the deadline fast approaching for a visit by Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev -- as early as next spring -- pressure is mounting to make some 
tangible progress on the issue soon. That opportunity may arrive Tuesday, when 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze comes here for three days of 
talks aimed at improving the atmosphere and, presumably, laying the groundwork 
for the first visit by a top Soviet leader since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It appears doubtful, however, that Shevardnadze will bring any major 
concessions that would break the stalemate over a bilateral peace treaty, which 
is still under negotiation 38 years after Japan settled for peace with the 
United States and the other Pacific War victors. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the watchword for Japan-Soviet relations is incremental change. The 
Soviet side agreed only recently to discuss the four islands that Japan calls 
the Northern Territories in periodic working-level meetings. Japan is only now 
modifying the language in its annual Defense White Paper, due out later this 
month, to tone down references to the "Soviet military threat" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any grounds to be optimistic on the Northern Territories issue," 
said a senior Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified by 
name. Although some Soviet think-tanks have recommended a more liberal response 
to Japan's territorial claim, he said, "we have not detected any concrete signs 
that these views have penetrated the Soviet leadership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
Animosity dates to the late 19th Century, when the two expansionist empires 
contested for influence in Manchuria and Korea and for territory -- the islands 
of Sakhalin and the Kurils. Japan came out on top with a victory in the 1904-05 
Russo-Japanese war. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union got revenge in 1945, however, when it violated a 
non-aggression pact in the final days of the war and advanced troops into 
Sakhalin and the southern Kurils. Japan abandoned claim to everything but four 
small islands in the Kuril chain closest to Hokkaido, which it says had never 
belonged to Russia and were never inhabited by anyone but Japanese or Ainu 
aborigines. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to work out a formula for the return of the islands has put economic as 
well as political relations on hold. The Soviet Union has in recent years 
appealed for Japanese help in its perestroika restructuring program. But Japan 
has steadfastly refused to budge on that front until Moscow shows signs of 
relenting on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlook 
</P>
<P>
There are no such signs. Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev said earlier 
this year: "The Soviet Union has no land to spare." And the president of the 
Russian Republic, Boris Yeltsin, visited the disputed islands last month and 
declared that more Soviet citizens should settle there. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a potential for warmer relations. Then-Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno 
suggested room for compromise when in May, 1989, he proposed what he called 
"expanded equilibrium" in "other areas" of the relationship, including 
economic, scientific and humanitarian exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have made some gestures. Japanese exiles from one of the disputed 
islands were allowed last month to visit graves they had not seen for 45 years. 
And the Yomiuri newspaper reported this week that Shevardnadze had "hinted" in 
an interview that the Kremlin may withdraw the division of ground troops it 
deploys on that island "to promote detente in the Asia-Pacific region." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's talks with Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama are expected to yield 
a bilateral agreement to cooperate on environmental protection, which may 
include research related to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
But attention will be focused on whether Shevardnadze and Nakayama cannot only 
set the stage for Gorbachev's visit next year but also put the peace treaty 
negotiations on track so that the summit meeting will be more than ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like Mr. Gorbachev's visit to Japan to be a substantial occasion to make 
a real breakthrough in Japan-Soviet relations, in a drastic and fundamental 
manner," said the Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo. "We're prepared to find 
common areas where we can make progress."

200 FOREIGNERS REPORTED KILLED IN LIBERIA

Liberian rebels have killed 200 foreign civilians from the five nations that 
make up a West African task force in Liberia, the Ghana News Agency said 
Friday. The killings were in retaliation for the force's presence there, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
A Ghana News Agency correspondent with the West African force said that rebels 
loyal to Charles Taylor began attacking the civilians shortly after the peace 
force arrived in Monrovia last Saturday to try to end the eight-month-old civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor opposes any intervention in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment Friday from Taylor, who confirmed on Thursday that he was 
holding thousands of foreign citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The task force fought its way to the eastern edge of Monrovia and took control 
of the capital's airport Friday, diplomatic sources in Freetown said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The airstrip is big enough to handle military transport planes. Controlling it 
will make resupplying the task force much easier. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia are 
under orders to end the conflict, which has turned into a tribal war. 
</P>
<P>
The Spriggs Payne Airfield had been in the hands of President Samuel K. Doe's 
troops but was under fire almost daily from Taylor's rebels, camped less than a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. said a spokesman for Prince Johnson, who broke 
with Taylor and leads a rival rebel group, called Friday to report that Doe's 
troops broke an informal truce and attacked Johnson's forces, killing 21 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Doe and Johnson had both welcomed intervention by the West African force and 
declared a truce more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the peacekeeping force pushed eastward toward the embassies of 
three member states -- Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria -- which lay just behind rebel 
lines. Taylor's rebels had rounded up thousands of Guineans, Ghanaians and 
Nigerians who had taken refuge at their embassies, saying they were being held 
for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghana News Agency quoted Ghanaian teacher Kwasi Kwateng, 36, as saying that 
rebels attacked a community of 2,500 Ghanaians living in Barnesville, about 3 
1/2 miles from Monrovia's port. 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave no specifics about this or other alleged attacks, however, and 
there was no confirmation from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Kweku Egyir, 52, a Ghanaian who has lived in Liberia since 1963, said Taylor's 
men were looking for Ghanaians and Nigerians in particular because their 
members of the African force had inflicted many casualties on the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Egyir said the rebels could identify Ghanaians and Nigerians by their accents 
and tribal scars. "The marks on our faces are called identity cards in this 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, calling Doe's government 
corrupt and pledging to overthrow it. His fighters quickly overran most of the 
West African country of about 2.5 million people, but they have been unable to 
dislodge troops loyal to Doe. Johnson's rebels, who split with Taylor, have 
taken control of much of the capital.

A bomb sank a Spanish naval patrol boat anchored in San Sebastian harbor Friday 
in the second bombing incident in the city in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Police said no one was injured in the blast on the 30-foot boat, which had been 
evacuated after Red Cross officials received an anonymous early morning warning 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Explosives experts rushed to the scene, but the bomb went off before they 
arrived. Police did not know the size of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Police Thursday defused a powerful parcel bomb sent to the head of the Civil 
Guard in Spain's northern province of Guipuzcoa. 
</P>
<P>
They said the bomb, containing 2.4 pounds of explosives, was hidden among 
geography books sent to Lt. Col. Enrique Rodriguez Galindo from Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for either of the bombs, which follow a wave of 
letter and parcel bomb attacks on judicial and government officials this year 
by ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatists.

BUSH TO FORGIVE EGYPT ARMS DEBT;

MILITARY: CANCELING THE $7.1 BILLION WOULD REWARD CAIRO FOR SUPPORTING THE 
EMBARGO, BUILDUP AGAINST IRAQ.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has agreed to forgive Egypt's $7.1-billion military debt to the 
United States as a reward for Cairo's support for the U.N. economic embargo 
against Iraq and the huge U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia, U.S. 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which Bush made at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., is 
expected to be the first of several such gestures that Washington is 
considering for Middle East countries that have supported the U.S. effort. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt receives about $2.3 billion in U.S. aid each year, of which approximately 
$1.3 billion is in military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. officials said Bush has decided to warn Jordan, gently 
but firmly, that it may jeopardize some of the aid it receives from the United 
States and other Western industrialized countries unless it takes a firmer 
stand against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Jordan's King Hussein to cut off the traffic still going to 
Iraq through his own country and to halt food shipments to Baghdad from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to send the message to King Hussein through a high-level delegation, 
probably headed by Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates, which will 
visit Amman, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the king has said he would honor the U.N.-imposed embargo, he has been 
highly critical of the U.S. troop deployment in the region, and trucks carrying 
supplies have continued to cross the nation's border into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, one of the poorest nations in the Middle East, has suffered severe 
economic losses from restricted trade with Iraq since the U.N. sanctions were 
approved early last month. The nation also has had to shoulder the burden of 
tens of thousands of refugees who have fled there from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the debt forgiveness for Egypt was specifically 
requested by President Hosni Mubarak, who talked with Bush by phone Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush phoned a series of foreign leaders Friday, including British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and 
Saudi Arabian King Fahd, as he sought to shore up support for his plan to share 
the mounting costs of the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In public, Administration officials continued to praise the efforts made to 
date by other governments, such as Japan, to help support the American-led 
efforts to roll back Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's annexation of Kuwait. 
U.S. officials are eager to avoid public disputes that could shatter the 
international consensus so carefully nurtured over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
But privately, U.S. officials made it plain that they intend to ask for more 
help from abroad than has been offered so far. The Administration's appeals are 
aimed at Japan, West Germany, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates and the exiled government of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, shortly after a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry ruled 
out any increase in the $1 billion Japan has already promised for the 
multinational forces in the Mideast, a State Department official bluntly 
predicted that the Japanese spokesman will be proven wrong. "All I can say is, 
we still need more (aid from Japan)," this official said. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, both Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady will be traveling overseas to talk with foreign officials 
about the mounting expenses of the Persian Gulf operations. Baker will make 
several stops in Europe and the Mideast, while Brady will visit Japan and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, Bush, according to aides, has spoken with eight foreign 
heads of state to try to coordinate financial aid plans and the international 
effort to impose economic sanctions on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
White House and State Department officials leave no doubt that the 
Administration is happier with some countries' response than with others. 
Administration officials were particularly effusive in their praise for 
Mitterrand, telling reporters about the "positive tone" in relations between 
France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The French have sent the second-most-powerful naval contingent to Middle 
Eastern waters after the American flotilla. And despite early suggestions that 
the French thought Bush was moving too quickly toward a military confrontation 
with Iraq, officials now say France is "strongly on board" in support of the 
international anti-Iraq effort. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, officials here offered few comments about West Germany's efforts. 
Before the current crisis began, U.S. officials were making much of the new 
strategic cooperation between Washington and Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed that the 
United States is keeping a war crimes file on violations of international law 
by Hussein, as was reported Friday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of course very concerned about Iraq's violations of international law, 
including the taking of hostages and the use of civilians as a shield against 
military operations," Tutwiler said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the American who died this week in Iraq was identified by his 
family as banker James L. Worthington Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington, 53, a native of Marathon, Tex., died Monday, his daughter told the 
Daily Freeman of Kingston, N.Y. "He was taken hostage in Kuwait and moved to 
Basra where he died of a heart attack," said Maggie Jean Neilson, 27, of 
Woodstock, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington had been working as a consultant for the Alahi Bank of Kuwait.

President Chaim Herzog sought Friday to restore a measure of calm to Israel, 
declaring in a broadcast "special commentary" that Iraq "has no interest in 
carrying out hostile operations." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog described Iraq's President Saddam Hussein as "a man who has erred and is 
trying to contain the damage." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Herzog had spoken out at length on the Persian Gulf 
crisis, which has caused much public consternation in Israel, particularly in 
light of repeated Iraqi threats to take military action against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
His views are regarded as not just those of a political figure; he was a major 
general in the Israeli army and chief of military intelligence before going 
into politics, and he is a noted military historian. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks appeared to reflect current military thinking. Military sources 
said Friday at a press briefing that Iraq's Hussein seems to be "trying to buy 
time." 
</P>
<P>
They said Iraq does not want a military confrontation with the United States 
and will try to wait out the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog said he realizes that "an atmosphere of an Iraqi threat against Israel 
has been created" and added that "it is correct that (Hussein) is dangerous and 
uncontrollable." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that Hussein "makes rational decisions, despite reaching mistaken 
conclusions, as we have seen." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the prompt intervention by President Bush and other Western leaders, 
Herzog said, Hussein "not only will not initiate the operation of missiles, he 
will not even initiate the operation of a machine gun." 
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to undertake military operations in the gulf region "is in 
my opinion limited solely to President Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog brushed aside warnings by some Iraqi military sources that Iraq will 
send missiles against Israel if the United States attacks Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not logical," he said, "that Saddam Hussein would desire to launch his 
missiles specifically against Israel, thereby opening another front. The number 
of missiles at his disposal is limited, and from the moment of being launched, 
the missiles turn the launching bases into targets, not only for the Israeli 
air force but for the entire force deployed against him. 
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, these missiles have not been tested at 
such long range. It is unclear whether they are equipped with chemical 
warheads. Until now, the Iraqis have used chemical weapons through bombs or 
artillery." 
</P>
<P>
The military officers made this same point, saying they have no firm evidence 
that Iraq has the capability of mounting a chemical attack with missiles. They 
said Iraq may be capable of fitting a chemical warhead on a missile but they 
doubt that it would be militarily effective. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they charged that the Jordanian air force has been flying 
reconnaissance missions along the Saudi Arabian border, presumably gathering 
intelligence for Iraq on allied troop positions. 
</P>
<P>
This, they said, puts Jordan's King Hussein even more firmly in the Iraqi camp, 
despite his protestations that he trying to find a peaceful solution to the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
President Herzog said he did not wish to give the impression that he regards 
the Iraqi army as a "paper tiger." But he recalled that the Iraqi army had not 
fought particularly well against Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the eight-year 
Iran-Iraq War. He said he agrees with the assessment that the Iran-Iraq War was 
"a delicate balance of incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog predicted that in the event of hostilities on the Arabian peninsula, the 
United States will achieve air superiority "very quickly" and that U.S. and 
allied ground forces will "overcome the Iraqi forces without difficulty."

GORBACHEV ENDORSES U.S. ROLE IN GULF;

CONTRADICTS THE OBJECTIONS OF OTHER KREMLIN OFFICIALS.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, contradicting objections raised by other Soviet 
officials to the U.S. troop buildup in the Persian Gulf region, said Friday 
that the superpowers are cooperating well in the region and that he does not 
fear the United States is seeking a permanent military presence there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very responsible, all of us, so as to prevent a large-scale 
military conflict," Gorbachev told a rare news conference. "I believe this is 
our common concern and we are promoting it." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president's statements came a day after two high-ranking officials 
expressed concern at the U.S. buildup in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander M. Belonogov had complained that there are no 
guarantees that American troops will leave after the present crisis ends, and 
Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, commander of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, had 
warned that the deployment of so many American troops in Saudi Arabia could 
alter the strategic balance. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, although he pressed once again for a political solution, said 
the United States is acting within its rights by moving into Saudi Arabia and 
that both superpowers are seeking to avoid a military clash. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the American leadership, after political solutions to this 
conflict have been found, will preserve" the military presence in the gulf, he 
said. And he predicted that limits on troops would be part of any resolution 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gorbachev warned that the buildup of forces "makes the 
situation very explosive, very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union voted for a U.N. resolution allowing the use of force to 
enforce economic sanctions against Iraq but has refused to take part in the 
U.S.-led naval blockade, saying that other countries are better equipped for 
the task. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been noncommittal about whether it would contribute troops to a 
multinational force if the United Nations should create such a force, neither 
ruling out the idea nor showing any enthusiasm for it. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said Soviet officials are making an energetic diplomatic effort to 
prevent war, using "telephone calls, conversations, work within the Security 
Council, our envoy's visit to the region, discussions with President (Saddam) 
Hussein -- everything possible." 
</P>
<P>
But he got in an undiplomatic dig at the Iraqi leader, saying that "only those 
who think illogically" could reject proposals for a peaceful resolution of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev rejected complaints that the Soviet Union is losing its prestige by 
not taking a forceful military role in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not so," he said. "I think everything will depend on whether we are 
successful using political measures." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, Iraq's longtime friend and arms supplier, is uniquely placed 
to serve as intermediary between Iraq and the West, but Foreign Ministry 
spokesmen have said repeatedly that Moscow does not relish the role and sees no 
need for it as long as Western diplomatic relations with Iraq are intact.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL SCENE SHIFTS LIKE SANDS OF DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON VIEW: RESPONSE TO MILITARY INTERVENTION NO LONGER IS REFLEXIVELY 
DIVIDING ALONG TRADITIONAL LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The bright glare of the Persian Gulf crisis is illuminating not only the 
glimmers of a post-Cold War international order, but also a potentially 
dramatic change in the domestic political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Both the general surge of support for President Bush's decision to confront 
Iraq with American forces and the isolated notes of objection may signal 
shifting alignments in the foreign policy debate. This first crisis after the 
end of the ideological struggle with the Soviet Union suggests that the 
domestic response to foreign military intervention no longer reflexively 
divides between liberal dissent and conservative zeal, the pattern that has 
existed since the Vietnam War turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush has faced only a handful of critics on the left -- and, just as 
surprisingly, almost as many on the right. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Democratic Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Terry 
Sanford of North Carolina have raised cautions about how much the United States 
should risk in the confrontation with Saddam Hussein. But no Democrat has been 
nearly as critical of Bush as conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, one 
of the country's most ardent Cold Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we send thousands of American soldiers to their deaths," Buchanan wrote 
earlier this week, "let's make damn sure America's vital interests are 
threatened." Though they are unlikely to inhibit Bush in the short run, these 
objections point to possible new alliances on foreign policy issues as the 
United States moves out of the Cold War that has dominated its politics for the 
past 40 years. With the Soviet threat effectively eliminated, some leading 
conservative thinkers are beginning to join the common liberal call of the past 
two decades for the United States to reduce its overseas military commitments 
and focus its resources on securing its economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of foreign policy and defense issues, you're seeing a bit of a 
realignment in the U.S.," said Ted Galen Carpenter, director of foreign policy 
studies at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington. "In a sense, it goes 
back to the pre-World War II period, when you had the isolationist -- or 
noninterventionist -- movement that drew from liberals and conservatives. . . . 
I think you are likely to see some of that in the future." 
</P>
<P>
But there are conflicting forces at work, too, that complicate Carpenter's 
equation and point toward a more complex and fluid realignment. That could 
result in liberals and conservatives arraying in shifting coalitions on each 
potential conflict, depending on their analyses of its impact on American 
national interest, not its transcendent ideological implications. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, with oil supplies at risk, the overwhelming fact of the crisis' 
first month is not the depth of opposition, but the breadth of support across 
the political spectrum for the President. 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, there is as broad a bipartisan support for what the President has 
done . . . as I have seen for a presidential action that involves the potential 
use of military power," said California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Most dramatic has been the paucity of Democratic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
At one level, this reflects the historic tendency of Americans to rally 'round 
the flag when soldiers are at risk. But the enormous Democratic assent for 
Bush's aggressive response, following the relative silence over the invasion of 
Panama, hints that the end of the Cold War may also encourage some liberals to 
revert to the interventionist traditions that dominated the party until 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the widespread Democratic support suggests to many a form of 
ideological vertigo similar to that affecting Buchanan and other conservative 
critics of the engagement. If conservatives routinely supported intervention 
abroad against pro-Communist Third World guerrilla movements, many liberals 
just as instinctively resisted it. But this conflict, notes Richard J. Barnet, 
co-director of the leftist Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, "is a 
much different situation than the classic counterinsurgency intervention of the 
post-war era. This does look more like the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, during the Cold War, liberals increasingly worried that foreign 
military engagements might escalate into a planet-threatening confrontation 
with the Soviet Union. But with the Soviets generally supporting the 
condemnation of Iraq, that concern has been erased. At the same time, the 
Soviets' cooperation in sanctions against Iraq has allowed President Bush to 
work through the United Nations -- exactly the course that the left has 
traditionally urged on Presidents in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats also privately concede that the congressional support for Bush 
reflects the Democrats' eagerness to deflect longstanding Republican charges 
that they lack the fortitude to fight for American interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
And the interest of Israel in the region may also be buttressing Democratic 
consent for the buildup. Levine insists that concern about Israel has not been 
"a triggering mechanism" for support of Bush's policy on the left. But many of 
the liberals traditionally most skeptical of U.S. military intervention abroad 
are also passionate supporters of Israel and may see the American confrontation 
with Iraq as a chance to eliminate a mortal threat to the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
"There are those people with an interest in Israel who feel . . . a war would 
work in their favor because it would wipe out a perceived hostile leader," said 
Stanley K. Sheinbaum, a veteran activist in liberal and Jewish causes in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, such as Alan Tonelson, the author of an upcoming book on 
redefining American foreign policy interests, say that potential critics have 
been muted primarily by the lack of good alternatives to the course Bush has 
pursued in the crisis' first weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kerrey -- though concerned that the United States is assuming too great "a 
preponderance of the (military) commitment" and convinced that "part of the 
problem is of our own making" for failing to pursue energy independence or 
earlier measures to contain Hussein -- nonetheless agrees that Iraqi 
"withdrawal from Kuwait does need to be our hard, non-negotiable point. Saddam 
Hussein cannot be permitted to escape as an Arab hero." 
</P>
<P>
Support for Bush on the left is far from universal, and those who are 
intrinsically skeptical of U.S. military intervention are beginning to raise 
their voices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being deluged with phone calls," said Gavrielle Gemma, a coordinator of 
the Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East, a group launched 
last week by former Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark. "There is a tremendous 
undercurrent of resentment and fear and antagonism about what the Bush 
Administration is doing." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, whose members include a diverse assortment of smaller leftist 
organizations, has called for immediate U.S. withdrawal from the region, 
arguing that the U.S. presence "was designed . . . to usurp Arab, and 
international, peaceful and diplomatic solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Other, more centrist liberal activists are urging that the United States reduce 
its military presence, replace its forces with troops from other nations, 
particularly Arab states, and step up efforts to negotiate a solution with 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as Barnet and former Democratic presidential candidate George S. 
McGovern, believe that the crisis opens a window for wider negotiations on the 
entire range of Mideast flash points -- including the development of chemical 
and nuclear weapons by Iraq and Israel and, as Hussein has suggested, Israeli 
control of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Still others on the left want to press Bush to ensure that Saudi Arabia and 
other allies pick up a substantial share of the operation's cost -- a notion 
seconded by Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president at the conservative 
Heritage Foundation. Pines, like many liberals, also supports an eventual 
replacement of many U.S. forces with troops from other Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure where the dispute between liberals and conservatives will come," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Revealingly, conservatives have spent more time arguing among themselves than 
with the left. One camp -- led by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, 
columnist William Safire and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard N. 
Perle -- have called for decisive military action against Iraq. Their views 
dominated the public debate in the early stages of the crisis, though they have 
faded this week as both sides have backed away from immediate confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
With less fanfare, a number of other conservatives -- including Buchanan, 
National Review senior editor Joseph Sobran and former National Security Agency 
Director William E. Odom -- have questioned whether a military victory could be 
won quickly, or would be worth the price. Buchanan has taken the most extreme 
position, arguing in a column this week that a Persian Gulf war would be a 
"quagmire" and that the United States should not escalate beyond the economic 
embargo -- even if that fails to drive Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"If it works, it works; if it fails, it fails," he wrote. "Kuwait is not worth 
the loss of the 82nd and 101st Airborne, and that's pretty much the asking 
price." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Carpenter of the Cato Institute is urging that the United States 
reduce its military presence in the gulf and give Arab states "the greatest 
latitude to work out a settlement" with Iraq that might not include a return to 
the status quo in Kuwait. To avoid war, he said, "there may have to be a 
compromise on Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
These arguments against intervention emerge from a deeper debate roiling the 
right. While many conservatives maintain that the end of the Cold War offers no 
excuse for reducing U.S. commitments, other conservative thinkers -- reviving 
views common in that camp through the early 1950s -- say that the United States 
can turn its attention inward now that the threat from the Soviet Union has 
essentially collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
This conviction can lead to sentiments virtually indistinguishable from those 
at a gathering of Americans for Democratic Action. 
</P>
<P>
"The time when Americans should bear such unusual burdens is past," former U.N. 
Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick writes in the upcoming issue of The National 
Interest, a conservative foreign policy journal. "With a return to 'normal' 
times, we can again become a normal nation -- and take care of pressing 
problems of education, family, industry and technology." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate danger of conflict in the gulf has at once accelerated and 
clouded this larger reassessment on the right. On the one hand, it has 
highlighted the doubts some prominent conservatives hold about the U.S. role as 
the world's global policeman. But the desire to back the President, and the 
belief that the United States must demonstrate resolve now that Bush has drawn 
a line in the sand, are also strong. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, while these intellectual currents eventually could unsettle the 
GOP coalition on foreign policy, they are unlikely to threaten Bush in the near 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick, for example, though questioning whether the invasion of Kuwait 
truly threatened vital American interests, has offered reluctant support for 
the mission -- while remaining critical of any move toward war. 
</P>
<P>
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) maintains that the Buchanan line 
has no support among conservatives in Congress. "There is an overwhelming sense 
among conservative elected officials that our pro-freedom stand around the 
world has worked . . . and that in the practical world of real power the U.S. 
has to remain involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how heavily involved, though, is a question that conservatives seem 
certain to debate with increasing intensity long beyond this crisis. That 
question "does represent something very profound about the debate that is going 
on in the conservative community about America's role in the post Cold-War 
world," Pines said. 
</P>
<P>
Events in the gulf may make these debates over how great a burden the United 
States should bear in this new era more than abstractions and ultimately fray 
the domestic coalition Bush has stitched together. 
</P>
<P>
But, for now, Bush stands in an enviable position. In the midst of ideological 
instability, he appears to have found a solid center on which to stand. "What's 
remarkable here is this President and the country now have a chance to do 
something together," said one senior House Democratic aide who deals with 
political and military matters. "And, so far, he has not squandered that 
opportunity."

Former defense consultant Mark Saunders was sentenced to 21 months in prison 
and fined $5,000 Friday for his role in funneling military procurement data to 
a defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. for his role 
in the Pentagon procurement scandal that is the subject of a long-running 
Justice Department investigation dubbed Operation Ill Wind. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has resulted in nearly 40 convictions of Pentagon officials, 
consultants and executives of defense firms as well as several corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, 56, was convicted on June 5 of conspiracy to defraud the government, 
wire fraud and conversion of government property. The former Navy procurement 
official who became a defense consultant was convicted of participating in a 
scheme to funnel secret Pentagon bid information to another defense consultant, 
who sold it to Norden Systems Inc., according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Three Norden executives already have pleaded guilty to taking part in the 
operation.

<P>
The key figures in Solidarity observed the 10th anniversary Friday of the 
movement's founding -- not so much a celebration of unity as a parting of the 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
Union leader Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who seem set to 
oppose each other in the campaign for the Polish presidency, both paid homage 
to the spirit of 1980 in the Gdansk shipyard where Solidarity was born. It was 
here that the two men sat side by side and signed the historic Gdansk accords 
in which the Communist government recognized the East Bloc's first independent 
trade union. 
</P>
<P>
But Walesa delivered what could be interpreted as the opening shot of his 
presidential campaign, still not officially declared despite many strong 
suggestions that he is preparing to run. 
</P>
<P>
"The revolution," he declared, "is not yet over." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki, who is milder by nature, countered, "Let us be political opponents, 
but never enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, taking up a theme sounded by his supporters, that the Mazowiecki 
government has been too deliberate in initiating changes, said, "We have done a 
great job, but many things have gone too slowly." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Thursday to shipyard workers, Mazowiecki had attempted to deflect 
the criticism of the Walesa camp. 
</P>
<P>
"This government has not been hindering, is not hindering and will not hinder 
political changes," he said. "We have been speeding up, not by arguing but by 
acting." 
</P>
<P>
As many Polish political commentators noted in the days preceding the 
anniversary, the deep split in Solidarity may be a sign of growing political 
maturity after a period in which the normal divisions in society were papered 
over by the Communist monolith. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, the division in Solidarity represents a return to a "civil 
society," where issues of public policy are openly and sometimes bitterly 
debated. 
</P>
<P>
There is nostalgia in some quarters for the fierce unity that characterized 
Solidarity's decade-long fight against the Communists, a period when 
Solidarity's voice was largely Walesa's. But there are philosophical divisions 
in the movement, principally among those who advocate a slower and less painful 
transition to a market system, accompanied by strong social welfare supports, 
and those who advocate a faster and harder course. 
</P>
<P>
The split has been exacerbated by the role of Walesa, who clearly wants the 
Polish presidency. Although his goal of winning the office seems more 
compelling to him than any particular difference with the Mazowiecki 
government, his complaint that things are moving too slowly in the new Poland 
is shared by many who complain about the archaic banking system and the 
government's seeming inability to deal with telecommunications problems.

Walesa has said he would be the "accelerator" for Poland or would serve as "the 
ax." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki's supporters say Walesa is unpredictable, inconsistent and 
impetuous, and the government's spokeswoman, Malgorzata Niezabitowska, has 
taken to referring to Walesa as "the accelerator with an ax." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Solidarity activists complain that Walesa has always had a dictatorial 
streak as the head of the union, a trait they say they would not want to see in 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
And while some Poles say they resent the idea that Walesa somehow deserves the 
presidency for his long years at the forefront of the fight against the 
Communists, others say his determination, impatience and ability to arouse the 
nation would indeed speed things up. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki and Walesa met privately for nearly an hour Friday at the shipyards 
in Gdansk, their first session together since early July, and emerged smiling 
but with little to say. 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief impasse as the two prepared to get into a car to depart. 
After a moment, Walesa got in at the front. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the front of this fight," he said, "so I will take the front 
seat."

Security forces charged opposition party marchers, clubbing the crowd with 
batons and firing tear gas to break up a rally near the residence of President 
Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Abidjan. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred demonstrators briefly sought refuge in the courtyard of the 
French Embassy, climbing its walls to escape police. Some of the marchers 
shouted for the resignation of Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled this West 
African nation since its independence from France in 1960. Defense Minister 
Jean Konan Banny had issued a warning that security forces would "use all 
necessary measures" to prevent the opposition parties from threatening public 
order.

El Pais reported the accounts, at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco de Santander, 
had been opened under a false name by the late Gustavo Gaviria, former No. 2

STUDENT QUESTIONED IN FLORIDA SLAYINGS

<P>
An 18-year-old University of Florida freshman charged with beating his 
grandmother was held on $1-million bond Friday, and police investigating the 
deaths of five students sealed his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Task force investigators refused to say whether he is considered to be among 
the potential suspects in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"At this particular time, we continue to have a pool of suspects," said Alachua 
County sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann. "To say that we have a prime suspect or 
prime two suspects or three suspects is very premature." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Lewis Humphrey was arrested Thursday at his grandmother's house in 
Indialantic, 180 miles to the southeast, and charged with aggravated battery, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents spent 12 hours at the jail in 
Sharpes where Humphrey was held, and Brevard Circuit Judge Dean Moxley 
increased Humphrey's bond to $1 million from $10,250 about an hour before the 
agents departed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for the killer, who 
investigators have called a "methodical maniac" with a sick grudge against 
petite brunettes with shoulder-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said that they are interested in an Ohio fugitive wanted in a 
mutilation slaying there. Mann said police were also looking for a man wearing 
camouflage pants who ran away when a state trooper tried to question him in 
Gainesville early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are interviewing or watching three or four other potential 
suspects, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- students at either the University of Florida or Santa Fe 
Community College in Gainesville -- were stabbed to death in off-campus 
apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday. Police said three of the 
four women were mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
Gainesville police sealed off Humphrey's apartment Thursday and questioned 
anyone attempting to enter the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We have investigators interested in that location. We have task force members 
who are interested in the area," said Lt. Sadie Darnell, a police spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Six detectives wearing rubber gloves and green smocks combed through six 
garbage bins at Humphrey's apartment complex and removed some undisclosed 
items. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of investigation, it's important not to overlook any possible 
kind of trace evidence," police investigator Gary Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey had been under surveillance since Tuesday, when the latest two victims 
were found at the Gatorwood apartment complex. He had lived in Gainesville over 
the summer but was evicted from Gatorwood, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Outraged over the Aug. 6 attack on an Orange County cheerleader that they 
believe was racially motivated, black activists Friday condemned the handling 
of the case by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Amber Jefferson, a 15-year-old Garden Grove freshman who should have been at 
her first cheerleading performance Friday, instead sat silently, her jaw wired 
shut and the side of her face stitched together, as black leaders promised 
candlelight vigils, church meetings and a possible appeal for state 
intervention on her case. 
</P>
<P>
While no charges have been filed as a result of a brawl that left Jefferson 
seriously injured, investigators and prosecutors said the case is among their 
highest priorities and promised a full investigation of any and all racial 
motives. But black leaders remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Orange County) sheriff's handling of this case is tantamount to 
tolerating racial violence, which could very well lead to even worse 
incidents," Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, declared at a press conference 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California does not need, nor should it invite, a situation that 
would be branded nothing less than 'Bensonhurst West,' " Ridley-Thomas said, 
flanked by top local and state officials from the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union 
and other black activists. 
</P>
<P>
Bensonhurst, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, became a symbol of racial violence 
last year after a black teen-ager, visiting the area with two black friends to 
look for a used car, was attacked and killed by a white mob. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County case, the racial elements in the attack on Jefferson are 
still in dispute, with no criminal charges filed. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that Jefferson was badly beaten and slashed during a midnight 
brawl outside a Stanton apartment complex that involved more than a dozen 
people. On one side there were mostly white teen-agers and a 42-year-old man, 
and on the other, several black, white and Latino youths -- Amber's friends. 
</P>
<P>
Some among the white group under investigation in the attack have maintained 
that the fight was not about race, but about jealous girlfriends. Jefferson -- 
who by all accounts was not involved in the argument that triggered the fight 
-- made the mistake of being caught in the middle of it, they have said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department initially said it was not investigating 
the incident as a racial attack. But under intense criticism from local 
activists, the department this week recommended the district attorney's office 
consider using a state "hate crime" law, for racially motivated attacks, 
against three of Jefferson's alleged attackers. 
</P>
<P>
The department also recommended a host of other assault and criminal charges 
against up to a dozen participants -- including some among Jefferson's group. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that (the activists) would prejudge this case," Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi said Friday. "What happened to Amber is obviously 
tragic, but it's our responsibility to deal with it in a professional manner, 
not an emotional one, and this case has got our attention at our highest 
levels."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON TRIES TO STEER TO MIDDLE OF ROAD WITH POSITIVE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Wilson dramatically changed the tone of his television advertising Friday 
with the announcement that next week he will begin airing a positive 
commercial, a marketing approach nearly extinct this political season. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial touts Wilson's general plans for programs to help coming 
generations of Californians -- more science teachers, early childhood 
education, prenatal health care -- and does not mention Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein, with whom Wilson is engaged in a tight battle for the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
"When we invest in our schools, when we invest in our children, we invest in 
our future," the Republican senator tells voters. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial will air across the state. On Monday, Wilson and Feinstein will 
quicken their campaigning pace with traditional Labor Day appearances that mark 
the beginning of the sprint to Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
In the ad, Wilson talks with a schoolteacher, sits with students, walks through 
a computer lab and visits a neonatal nursery. Spliced into the mix are pictures 
of favorable newspaper accounts of Wilson proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial presents a broad outline of Wilson's priorities, without delving 
into how much money he will commit to the programs he mentions or where he 
would get the funds. 
</P>
<P>
The first Wilson commercial since June that does not seek to tar his Democratic 
adversary, it comes as the two candidates find themselves running dead even, 
according to a Los Angeles Times Poll released last week. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to earlier days, when Feinstein found high approval among women and 
Wilson among men, the race seems to have settled into a more partisan division, 
with Democrats favoring Feinstein and Republicans attracted to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
To win, either candidate will have to attract moderates of both parties, and 
the commercial underscores Wilson's effort to set himself apart from the more 
socially conservative Republicans who have held past governorships. 
</P>
<P>
As comparisons go, Wilson's ad presents a candidate closer in feel to moderate 
George Bush than conservative Gov. George Deukmejian and his ideological soul 
mate, Ronald Reagan. Indeed, just as Bush campaigned as the "education 
President," a press release issued by Wilson's campaign Friday said he wishes 
to be the "education governor." 
</P>
<P>
On issues such as drug abuse, prenatal care, education and social welfare, 
Wilson tends to inhabit very moderate turf. There, he is meeting Feinstein, who 
is trying to one-up the senator with her own pleas for an increased emphasis on 
early childhood education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Each has proposed increasing the availability of preschool for 4-year-olds in 
the state, citing education experts who say that children who attend preschools 
are less likely to drop out and more likely to get a job after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has pledged to restore $462 million in cuts to education slashed from 
the state budget by Deukmejian in this year's dicey round of budget cutting. 
Wilson has yet to take a position on the specific programs cut by the governor, 
his press aide Bill Livingstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has won considerable acclaim from educators by calling for the 
systematic integration of social welfare services into the state's school 
system. The senator said that placement of mental health counselors and social 
workers in schools would help protect endangered children before their problems 
lead them to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
While his commercial advocates an activist role -- "What happens here in the 
classrooms of California is too important for the governor to be on the 
sidelines," it says -- Wilson has refused to attach specific financial sources 
for some of his programs, including the social integration plan. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the commercial said Wilson advocates "more teachers from the 
fields of science, math and computers." His campaign's research director, Loren 
Kaye, said Wilson has not determined how to pay for that. The funding, Kaye 
said, hinges on whether Wilson opts to encourage corporations to loan employees 
to schools to serve as teachers -- and assume the financial burden -- or 
whether school districts would have to foot some or all of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The funding sources Wilson is considering are likely to provoke some argument 
from advocates of other cash-strapped programs. The senator has stipulated that 
his early childhood education program for the state's 4-year-olds would be 
phased in with increments from Proposition 98, which provides money to 
education. Legislators and Deukmejian have had longstanding battles over how to 
spend that money, with each side opting for different programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also plans to finance a prenatal care program for women without medical 
coverage by taking money from the state's tobacco tax. That money already goes 
to education and health programs that would need to be cut back if Wilson's 
program skims off some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us an opportunity to put our priorities into the mix," research 
director Kaye said.

KUWAIT ESCAPE -- A PORTRAIT OF TERROR; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM: SOUTHLAND BANKER WAS CONFRONTED BY IRAQI SOLDIERS ON HIS DESERT GAMBLE 
BUT BLUFFED HIS WAY PAST THEM. HE IS REUNITED WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN AT

<P>
Three weeks and one aborted escape after Iraqi soldiers seized his neighborhood 
in Kuwait, Southern California banker Abdalla (Tony) Touny thought his gamble 
for freedom would explode, literally, in his face. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after 3 a.m. on Aug. 21 and Touny, a friend and two men he 
described as Bedouin "guides" were driving northwest through the desert, bound 
for the safety of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped us," Touny said, referring to the Iraqi soldiers. "They almost 
killed us. They surrounded us with machine guns. They were checking for 
Americans and Kuwaitis. I told them (in Arabic), 'I'm a bookkeeper, I'm a 
clerk.' I told them I was Egyptian." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more harrowing minutes the Iraqis relented -- and Touny was headed 
toward becoming one of only a few Americans in Kuwait to flee the grip of 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of me," Touny said Friday during an interview in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by goodwill cigarettes he passed to Jordanian border guards, along with 
the savvy and cachet of the Bedouins, to whom Touny said he paid a $750 fee, he 
made it into the capital city of Amman, Jordan, at about 10 that same morning. 
</P>
<P>
In the wee minutes of Friday morning, Touny was reunited at Los Angeles 
International Airport with his wife, 13-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son. 
A few hours later Touny recounted his odyssey to freedom at the family's 
temporary apartment in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Touny, 46, provided a uniquely informed perspective on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
An Egyptian by birth but an American citizen since 1974, Touny earned his 
master's degree at New York University and for the last three years has been 
the chief manager of operations for the Bank of Kuwait and the Bank of the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Touny said he has supervised the accounts of members of the Kuwaiti royal 
family. The palace of the monarch of Kuwait, he said, was on grounds behind the 
rented villa where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his relationship with members of the royal family, Touny said he 
thinks the Kuwaitis would be willing to pay Hussein "whatever money he wants" 
to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Touny's brush as a captive of the Iraqis was tinged with no small amount of 
irony. The Touny family had been spending the summer in Newport Beach, as they 
try to do every year, when he returned by himself to the tiny Middle Eastern 
nation on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was exhausted," Touny recalled, "I had not slept for about 24 hours. So, 
when I got to my villa (at about 2 a.m.), I went to bed." 
</P>
<P>
But two hours later, the phone rang. It was his wife, Abla, watching television 
half the world away in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me there was a war," Touny said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
By daybreak, Touny had no doubt. He could hear the explosions and see the 
flashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran to the ATM machines (at the bank), and they were closed," Touny said, 
adding that he had flown to Kuwait the night before with only the equivalent of 
$36 American dollars in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
After borrowing money from friends, Touny said he was part of a surge of 
immediate panic buying. He said he stood in line two hours that first day to 
buy canned goods, rice, bread, powdered milk and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the proximity of the Kuwaiti emir's royal palace, the Iraqi troops 
were quickly a presence in his neighborhood, looting homes and controlling 
access in and out at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of Iraqi actions in my neighborhood," he said. "I tried to be 
low-key and stay out of their sight." 
</P>
<P>
About one week later, when he and friends tried to escape by car to Saudi 
Arabia, Iraqi troops stopped and ordered them back to Kuwait city. By that 
point, he had long since lost phone contact with the United States and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept calling the State Department every single day," said Abla Touny, a 
chemist who had hoped to return to her job at Kuwait University. "I was really 
going crazy. I mean, it was just a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tony Touny said he and other Americans kept in daily contact with 
the American Embassy in Kuwait, whose officials warned them not to try another 
escape through Saudi Arabia. Until the time he fled Kuwait, Touny said he saw 
the results of car bombing and other anti-Iraqi, guerrilla-type activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of Kuwaiti resistance, even right before I left," Touny said. 
</P>
<P>
From his perspective, Touny said, Hussein's motive for invading and occupying 
Kuwait is simple. Iraq, he said, is "a bankrupt country. They're looking for 
someone to bail them out. They want the money. And they want access to the 
(Persian) Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Touny said he will begin seeking a safe, stateside job. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't risk my life anymore," he said.

TURNABOUT BOOSTS WALLACH'S HOPES FOR REVERSAL OF WEDTECH CONVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
SCANDAL: GOVERNMENT CHARGES OWN WITNESS WITH PERJURY. INDICTMENT SEEMS TO BACK 
CALIFORNIAN'S CLAIM THAT HE WAS FOUND GUILTY ON THE BASIS OF A LIE. 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When California lawyer E. Robert Wallach was convicted of fraud and 
racketeering in the Wedtech defense-contracting scandal last year, he cried 
foul: A key government witness had committed perjury, he contended. But federal 
prosecutors turned a deaf ear. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, even the prosecutors concede that they believe Wallach's 
allegations, and -- in a bizarre turn of events -- the witness, Anthony 
Guariglia, former president of Wedtech, has been indicted, providing Wallach 
with new hope that his own conviction may be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, defense lawyers say that Wallach has a good chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
To convict Guariglia of perjury, prosecutors ironically now must argue that his 
testimony at Wallach's trial was "significant" -- implying that Wallach may 
have been convicted at least partly on the basis of a lie. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal lawyers say it may be the first case of its type in which the 
government has prosecuted one of its key witnesses for perjury and illustrates 
the fragile relationships -- and the problems -- that can arise from the 
prosecution's use of witnesses who are tainted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare for the government to charge one of its own witnesses with perjury, 
especially a witness who has helped you win a conviction," admits a government 
lawyer who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, in an organized crime case, you will bring charges against a 
prosecution witness who has double-crossed you by changing his story on the 
witness stand and backing away from what he told a federal grand jury," he 
said. "But this case is different." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if Wallach's conviction is overturned, it would mark the third such 
reversal in the Wedtech scandal. The convictions of Lyn Nofziger, Ronald 
Reagan's White House communications director, and former Rep. Robert Garcia 
(R-N.Y.) also have been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The ironic turnabout has resulted primarily from Wallach's own persistence in 
pursuing the allegations and from an unexpected telephone call to federal 
prosecutors from a businessman who had known Guariglia and was willing to 
provide a tip. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach has also had help from an unlikely legal pair -- Dennis Riordan, a 
liberal lawyer from San Francisco, and former U.S. Judge Robert H. Bork, the 
brainy conservative law professor whom Reagan nominated -- and then saw 
defeated -- for a seat on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, 56, got into trouble for attempting to influence his longtime friend, 
then-White House aide (and later Atty. Gen.) Edwin Meese III, on Wedtech's 
behalf -- channeling almost 200 notes, memos and phone calls to Meese in return 
for more than $400,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
In federal district court in Manhattan last year, he was convicted on fraud and 
racketeering charges and given a six-year prison sentence, which he has yet to 
serve pending his appeal. He was also assessed $675,000 in fines and 
forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
Guariglia, 39, an accountant by training, and Mario Moreno, 48, who had been 
Wedtech's executive vice president, were the prosecution's two key witnesses, 
testifying at length about Wallach's allegedly corrupt dealings with Wedtech. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, both men had been tainted themselves. Before agreeing to 
cooperate with federal prosecutors, each had pleaded guilty to bribery 
conspiracy charges in connection with payoffs to prominent political figures. 
</P>
<P>
At Wallach's trial, Guariglia acknowledged that he once had used company money 
for personal gambling, but he insisted that he had reformed -- on orders from a 
federal bankruptcy court. Guariglia swore repeatedly he had been following the 
court's edict to a tee. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach's lawyers uncovered records from casino pit bosses showing that 
Guariglia had gambled heavily on a recent trip to Puerto Rico -- implying that 
he had lied to the jury and therefore was not a credible witness. 
</P>
<P>
But Guariglia denied the charges, and Judge Richard Owen refused to allow the 
defense to call the casino pit bosses to cast further doubt on Guariglia's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutors themselves had begun to suspect that Guariglia had 
lied, but they argued after the trial that any perjury that he may have 
committed was insignificant and "tangential." Owen agreed, ruling that the 
verdict would have gone against Wallach anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But last February, Assistant U.S. Atty. Baruch Weiss, the lead prosecutor of 
Wallach, received an unexpected phone call from a businessman who said 
Guariglia had told him he was skimming substantial sums from a separate 
stationery business that he owned. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman's tip led to new evidence that Guariglia had lied to federal 
prosecutors about how large that firm's profits were. That, and Guariglia's 
questionable court testimony, prompted prosecutors to seek a perjury indictment 
against him, Weiss said in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
In Wallach's appeal, the Californian's lawyers contend that Guariglia's alleged 
perjury no longer can be considered insignificant. Under the law, a person may 
be charged with perjury only if his lies under oath were "substantial, relevant 
and material." 
</P>
<P>
Some independent legal scholars agree. "It seems to me the government cannot 
have it both ways," says one legal expert not connected with the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Either Guariglia's testimony was material or not. If his perjury was not 
significant, as the government first claimed, then how can the government 
indict and prosecute him?" 
</P>
<P>
Weiss refused to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Bork, who says he began helping Wallach several months ago after mutual friends 
approached him about the case, calls Wallach's conviction "an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Bork and Riordan contend that traditionally, in cases where prosecutors 
knowingly offer perjured testimony in prosecuting a defendant, the overturning 
of such convictions is "virtually automatic." 
</P>
<P>
And although they concede there is no evidence here that prosecutors were aware 
of Guariglia's apparent misstatements before the trial, they argue that Weiss' 
rejection of Wallach's initial allegations amounted to "reckless or negligent 
disregard of the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, who was suspended from legal practice after his conviction, said he is 
confident that he will be granted a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Developments are certainly promising," he wrote in a letter to friends. "I 
remain convinced that the system will work and that the outrage will become a 
victory." 
</P>

TORTOISES GET CHANCE TO WIN LIFE-OR-DEATH SHELL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike their heavily armored parents, baby desert tortoises are saddled with 
soft, fingernail-thin shells that make them "walking ravioli" for predators and 
reduce the chances that the imperiled species can be saved from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
A key to improving the odds of survival for the tortoise may lie in the 
basement of a Cal State Dominguez Hills laboratory where biologists have 
established a special hatchery and nursery for the benign herbivores. 
</P>
<P>
There, David Morafka, a professor of biology and an authority on the reptiles, 
and graduate student Michelle Joyner are pampering more than 60 "babies in the 
basement" with a goal of reviving and managing wild tortoise populations 
decimated by off-road vehicles, military maneuvers, housing developments, 
disease, poaching, drought and hungry ravens. 
</P>
<P>
The tortoises under study in the laboratory were donated by collectors and 
breeders and eventually will be set free in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Once abundant in the deserts of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, there are 
only an estimated 60,000 desert tortoises left in the wilds, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills hatchery, which began operating earlier this 
month, is one of six being established at laboratories and protected lands 
throughout the Southwest in an effort to save the slow-moving tortoises, whose 
numbers have declined dramatically in the deserts around Southern California, 
Morafka said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to add the desert 
tortoise to the nation's list of threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
"We know very little about what goes on in the first year of a desert 
tortoise's life," Morafka said. "In fact, if we treated them as a separate 
species, they would be one of the least-understood animals in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
What little is known about infant tortoises, however, suggests that they are 
voracious, and ambitious, little critters. 
</P>
<P>
"They eat like little wolves to grow like crazy and get out of the 'ravioli' 
stage as quickly as possible," Morafka said. "They are also very ambitious -- 
about two-thirds of them start digging burrows from day one." 
</P>
<P>
Even such impressive natural talents, however, are no match for developer's 
bulldozers or for ravens, which regard baby tortoises as a favorite meal. 
</P>
<P>
The tortoise hatchery at Cal State Dominguez Hills was funded entirely with a 
$27,000 grant from the Southern California Edison Co., which operates power 
lines and stations throughout the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems we run into are land-use conflicts with critical species, 
and the desert tortoise is one of the most widely distributed endangered 
species in the desert," said John Palmer, a research scientist with the 
utility. "The general commercial and residential growth in the region will 
increasingly impinge on tortoise habitat." 
</P>
<P>
A similar tortoise hatchery has been built outdoors with predator-proof brick 
and chicken wire in the Mojave Desert on land owned by the U.S. Army at Ft. 
Irwin, near Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 60 eggs in two enclosures that should be hatching pretty 
soon," said Tom Clark, a civilian ecologist at the Army base, otherwise 
reserved for desert training exercises. "The knowledge we gain here will be 
helpful to everybody, including the Army, because we need basic information to 
manage the impact of our maneuvers." 
</P>
<P>
Morafka suggested that saving tortoises has become a cause celebre, in part 
because they symbolize a "wholesome connection" with otherwise harsh and arid 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"When people think of the desert they think of tarantulas, rattlesnakes, 
scorpions and cactus," Morafka said. "But the tortoise is a benign vegetarian, 
something that brings back good memories of growing up."

BOB BAKER: THE SACRIFICE BEHIND THE SPEECHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ana Veliz will rest Monday with a sober appreciation of the cliches of 
sacrifice and sweat and dignity that the rest of us hear dimly on Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation obituaries will be read, as they are each September, for 
organized labor. Grave pundits will note that fewer than one in six American 
workers now belong to a union. Defenders of labor will blame an unfair economic 
landscape, a society in which workers with enough grievances and guts to strike 
often find themselves permanently replaced by non-union substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Veliz will not notice most of this debate because she does not speak 
English. But she knows. Ana Veliz was a striker who lost something more 
precious than a job. 
</P>
<P>
She lost her unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
She is 30 years old. Two years ago she came to Los Angeles from El Salvador, 
leaving her six children, ages 2 to 12, at home with her mother. Her common-law 
husband, Leonidas Ramirez, had come here seven years before. He had worked with 
cattle at home but could not feed the family. Here he would work as a gardener 
and send money back. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually Ramirez needed help. His wife would have to join him. Together 
they would scrape by, feed those back home and somehow begin saving to bring 
the children here with the help of the coyotes who smuggle illegal immigrants 
at $1,000 to $2,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
They found a one-room apartment at Pico Boulevard and Western Avenue where the 
traffic noise rushes into the third-floor window and the rent is $425 a month. 
There is room for two small beds and two small couches. They take in a boarder, 
sometimes two, to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Veliz found a typical immigrant job, cleaning Century City office buildings at 
$4.25 an hour, the minimum wage. She and Ramirez sent much of their income -- 
$400 -- home each month. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall organizers from Service Employees International Union, whose 
president, John Sweeney, was once a janitor, began an organizing drive in 
Century City, targeting a Denmark-based cleaning corporation that employed 
Veliz and about 200 others. 
</P>
<P>
The union demanded that the cleaning corporation recognize it as the janitors' 
bargaining agent. It demanded that wages be raised a dollar an hour more. It 
demanded health insurance. It got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
In March Veliz became pregnant. This baby would not need a coyote. It would be 
an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later the union called a strike. Veliz and more than half of her 
colleagues walked off the job. Several noisy demonstrations were held in 
Century City. Banners -- "Luxury by Day, Sweatshop by Night," and "Justice for 
Janitors" -- were unfurled. The employer did not budge. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later Veliz joined a union march of 400 janitors and friends from a 
park in Beverly Hills to Century City. About 100 officers of the Los Angeles 
Police Department blocked their path, herded them into the intersection of 
Olympic Boulevard and Century Park East and demanded that they disperse. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators refused. Veliz, like many, sat down in the middle of the 
street. This was planned. Union organizers expected that their members would be 
peacefully arrested. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. Police began to club them back down Olympic. Veliz ran. A club 
smacked her in the back -- three times, she thinks. She and many others were 
eventually herded into a parking garage and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In jail, she said, she complained of pain and was given what she was told were 
vitamins. Twenty minutes later she began throwing up. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later a physician at a county hospital informed her that she had 
miscarried. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, the janitorial corporation, reacting to public revulsion at 
television broadcasts of the police violence in Century City, gave in. It 
signed a contract with the union raising minimum wages to $5.20 an hour, with 
health benefits. Another $152 a month. In union circles desperate for success, 
the victory won national acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Veliz, sitting on one of her couches in her tiny apartment, is asked if it 
was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I paid a lot," she says in Spanish, stoically. "I never thought 
they would beat us. I would never have been near the front if I thought so. 
</P>
<P>
"But to earn $4.25 an hour is not fair. What I did, I didn't do without 
thought. I'm proud to have a union. I've seen the strength you have." 
</P>
<P>
Will she always be a cleaning lady? How long will it take to bring her children 
here? 
</P>
<P>
"For now I don't have anything else. As long as God allows me I will keep doing 
my job." 
</P>
<P>
This is what new arrivals have always said. You work. For a living. 
Transcendent concerns are for others. Too much rides on each day. If only there 
were a moment to stop and think. 
</P>
<P>
Let Monday be that moment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : DANA DEPUTY GRAY TO RUN AGAINST GALANTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a prelude to a showdown next spring, Mary Lee Gray, senior deputy to Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, announced Friday in Playa del Rey that 
she is running against Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on the Ballona Creek bicycle trail, Gray accused Galanter 
of "a lack of leadership" in failing to solve the council district's critical 
problems, including crime, traffic, overdevelopment, gang violence, air 
pollution and airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
"Herunresponsiveness to community problems has greatly concerned me," Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The early announcement and decision to formally establish a campaign committee 
next week will allow Gray to start raising money for what could become an 
expensive and partisan race against the first-term councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Galanter said she will defend her record during the campaign, 
which ends next April. "I intend to win reelection by doing my job and doing it 
well," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter served notice that her new opponent's association with Dana will 
likely become an issue in the heavily Democratic district, which includes 
Venice, Playa Del Rey, Westchester, Mar Vista and the Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
Gray insisted she is running an independent campaign and warned against "guilt 
by association" and negative campaigning in the contest. JEFFREY L. RABIN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : BRADLEY SEEKS EXTENSION OF RESERVISTS' 
BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley asked the Los Angeles City Council Friday to extend the 
health and dental care benefits of city employees who are reservists called to 
duty during the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Many city employees who are currently reservists will likely be called upon to 
assist our armed forces in the coming months," Bradley wrote in a letter to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent upon us to extend our commitment to providing health care to 
the families of those employees who are called to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, city policy only provides benefits for 30 days from the last day the 
reservist reports to work, but the proposed ordinance would extend them 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
There are 996 reservists working for the city, 541 of them considered active. 
About 15% to 20% of the active reserves are expected to be called into duty.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : APPRAISER PLEADS GUILTY IN S&amp;L FRAUD 
SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harlan Wolfe, a Glendale real estate appraiser, has pleaded guilty to one count 
of conspiracy and four counts of failing to file income tax returns in Los 
Angeles federal court. The crimes occurred while Wolfe was doing appraisals for 
now-defunct Consolidated Savings Bank, which was based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy charge involved a scheme in which Wolfe and other individuals 
prepared and placed on Consolidated's books a fraudulent appraisal used to 
create the false impression for federal regulators that a $500,000 loan to two 
straw borrowers was an adequately secured real estate loan. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. Atty. Gregory D. Schetina said Wolfe, 61, faces a maximum of nine 
years in custody and a $650,000 fine when he is sentenced later this year. 
Consolidated has been designated as one of the Justice Department's top 100 
priority savings and loan cases nationwide and remains under investigation.

SOUTHLAND IS WARMING UP TO LABOR DAY WEEKEND; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: WEATHERMEN PREDICT 'REAL PLEASANT' DAYS. BUT THE CHP FORECASTS A 
DANGEROUS TIME ON THE ROADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Southern Californians took to the highways for the last 
long weekend of summer, with prospects of mostly clear skies and warm weather 
through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be real pleasant," said meteorologist Stephen Burback of WeatherData 
Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures should reach the 70s at the beaches, the high 70s and low 80s in 
the mountains and 105 to 110 degrees at the Colorado River resorts in eastern 
deserts, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the good weather news. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the Labor Day holiday, from 6 p.m. Friday to midnight 
Monday, is generally the deadliest long weekend of the year, said California 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Alice Huffaker in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
She said 63 people died in traffic accidents on California's streets and 
highways over the Labor Day weekend last year. Most were not wearing seat 
belts, Huffaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Day weekend is what the CHP calls a maximum enforcement period. That 
means every available officer and patrol unit will be on the roads along with 
seven helicopters and 11 aircraft," Huffaker said. Last year, the CHP arrested 
almost 2,500 drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At the CHP's Southern Division headquarters, Officer Lydia Martinez urged 
motorists to check their cars for sufficient water and tire pressure before 
setting out on trips. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of people who try to get away for the summer one last time, and 
we find that a lot of them end up with disabled cars that could have been 
avoided if they had safety-checked their auto," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone to buckle their seat belts," Martinez said. It is especially 
important to have children in restraining seats, she said.

GOVERNOR RECEIVES LEGISLATION ON COUNTY TAXES FOR TRANSIT, JAILS 
</P>

<P>
Calling it a "Solomon-like" solution, lawmakers passed and sent to the governor 
Friday a measure that would allow Los Angeles County voters to approve local 
sales tax increases for transit and jails without violating state law. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation corrects a conflict on the November ballot where Los Angeles 
County voters will be asked to endorse two local sales tax increases, each 
calling for a half-cent tax on each dollar of sales. If both pass, the sales 
tax rate charged in the county would reach 7 1/2% -- exceeding the 7% maximum 
set by state law . 
</P>
<P>
But the legislation approved by the Legislature allows the county to avoid the 
violation by providing that if both measures pass, the tax amount of each would 
be reduced from 0.5% to 0.25%. 
</P>
<P>
The bill glided through the Senate without opposition but in the Assembly 
objections were raised by Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) and it won approval 43 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said it would be misleading to ask voters to back a half-cent sales tax 
hike that may end up being a quarter of a cent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of the fact that local elected officials in Los Angeles 
couldn't figure out what they wanted to do so they put both (measures) on the 
ballot," Katz said. "I wish local officials had solved this problem 
(themselves)." Revenue from the two measures would be used for transportation 
and jail improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) responded by suggesting that if lawmakers 
passed the bill, they would keep the issue out of the courts where "the only 
winners are the lawyers who file lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Solomon-like way to deal with the question of what to do if two 
measures pass that cause you to exceed the sales tax limit," he said. "It's 
fair. It's good."

RISE IN ROLEX WATCH THEFTS PROMPTS POLICE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police reported Friday that wearers of pricey Rolex watches fell 
victim to robbery at the rate of one each day during August and warned that the 
thieves may be carefully studying the daily routines of their intended victims. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the crimes follow a familiar pattern in which thieves target those 
who wear the most expensive Rolex timepieces -- preferably top-of-the-line 
models such as the President, which sells for $10,000 and more. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several cases in which, clearly, the robbers knew a lot about their 
victims," Wilshire Division Police Detective Aaron Martin said. "Victims who 
wear Rolex Presidents have been approached on days when they happened to have 
left their watches at home. They were asked to give up watches they weren't 
wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Police on Friday also released composite sketches of two suspects in a recent 
killing in West Los Angeles that occurred during a Rolex robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are looking for two men who went to a popular nursery on La Cienega 
Boulevard and shot owner Donald McKinsey after he fended off the would-be 
robbers' attempts to wrest away his $13,000 Rolex President. 
</P>
<P>
According to the detectives, the men had gone to the nursery the day before the 
Aug. 3 shooting and told employees that they had an appointment with the owner. 
Employees told the men that they were not scheduled to meet McKinsey and that 
the owner was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen returned on Aug. 3 and met McKinsey in a secluded part of the 
nursery, police said. While discussing a floral wedding arrangement, the men 
attempted to take McKinsey's Rolex, then fired on the owner. Fatally wounded, 
McKinsey reportedly staggered toward his office and collapsed, still clutching 
his watch. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, police also announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to 
the capture of the killers, who fled the shooting scene in a yellow Lincoln 
Town Car. 
</P>
<P>
Five other Rolex robberies were reported in the Wilshire Division area this 
month. Authorities in Hollywood, West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly 
Hills also reported multiple watch thefts in August. This year, there have been 
three murders connected with the Rolex robberies. 
</P>
<P>
While detectives were careful not to advise against purchasing expensive 
watches, they warned of the violence that the watches can attract. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the position to recommend what kind of jewelry people can wear 
or not wear," Martin said. "The issue that has been raised is that (potential) 
victims need to decide how important it is to wear that watch." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the watches have been a symbol of luxury for years, and it is 
difficult to isolate what has spurred the recent wave of thefts. The relative 
ease with which stolen Rolexes are resold may be one explanation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much demand from legitimate citizens who want to pay half-price 
for used watches," Wilshire Division Detective John McCarley said. "As long as 
there is a demand, there will be a supply." 
</P>
<P>
McCarley said a stolen watch with an original retail price of $10,000 is 
typically resold for about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be honest . . . they are nice watches," Martin said.

STATE JUSTICES BLOCK ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MENENDEZ TAPES; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER CASE: COURT WANTS TIME TO CONSIDER CHALLENGE TO RECORDINGS' RELEASE. 
MEANWHILE, A WOMAN SAYS ON TV THAT SHE OVERHEARD BROTHERS' CONFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the attempts of 
prosecutors to obtain tape recordings in which brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez 
allegedly confess to a psychotherapist that they murdered their wealthy parents 
in the family's Beverly Hills mansion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The justices issued the temporary stay on Thursday to give themselves 
additional time to consider a request by the brothers' defense attorneys, who 
are challenging a Los Angeles Superior Court ruling that would have allowed the 
release of the controversial tapes. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are considered important evidence in the case against Lyle, 22, and 
Erik, 19, who are being held without bail on charges that they killed their 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Mary (Kitty) Menendez, 47, for a $14-million 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
The recordings were made by psychotherapist L. Jerome Oziel, who counseled the 
brothers after the shotgun slayings of their parents on Aug. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers maintain their innocence, and defense lawyers say the tapes of 
their conversations with Oziel were privileged doctor-patient communications 
and are therefore inadmissible as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
But three weeks ago, Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht ruled that the 
prosecutors may use the tapes, saying that the normal privacy rights were 
abrogated because the brothers threatened to harm Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
While the contents of the tapes have not been made public, another recent 
development may have shed some light on what they contain. In a televised 
interview on ABC's "Primetime Live" aired Thursday, a key witness claimed to 
have overheard the brothers' confessions to Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
Judalon Rose Smyth, a former patient of Oziel who contacted police after 
learning of the alleged confessions, said in the interview that the 
psychotherapist instructed her to sit in a nearby room and eavesdrop on 
discussions he had with Lyle and Erik Menendez last Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik said that Lyle made him take the first shot," Smyth said. "I suppose 
that's because Lyle thought that if he didn't make Erik shoot the first shot 
then he might not be strong enough to do that. They didn't talk about shooting 
the father a whole lot. They did talk that they had to keep shooting the mother 
and they kept shooting her because she didn't move and they thought she might 
have lived." 
</P>
<P>
Smyth has declined to discuss her interview with other reporters, and 
prosecutors and defense lawyers would not confirm her account. Moreover, Smyth 
is suing Oziel, alleging physical and sexual assault and fraud. Neither Oziel 
nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the television interview, Smith said Oziel wanted her to listen in so that 
she could call police in case the conversation turned "violent or dangerous." 
She said the brothers indicated that the crime was directed at their father. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that I heard Lyle say that was really disturbing to me," 
said Smyth, "was . . . 'For once, my father would have to congratulate me and 
give me credit that I planned the perfect murder. I carried out the perfect 
murder.' "

TYSON'S FIGHT PUT OFF BECAUSE OF BAD CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tyson suffered a cut in a sparring accident Friday afternoon at Atlantic 
City, N.J., that required 48 stitches to close, forcing a postponement of the 
former heavyweight champion's bout with Alex Stewart Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, according to his promoter, Don King, had just hit sparring partner Greg 
Page with two punches in a spirited exchange when Page fell forward, his head 
striking Tyson's head and cutting his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Both boxers were wearing headgear, and no one seemed sure how Tyson was cut, 
whether by the edge of Page's headgear or his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was partly Greg's head coming forward and Mike bobbing and weaving . . . 
and their heads just came together," King said. 
</P>
<P>
An Atlantic City plastic surgeon, Ira Trocki, treated Tyson at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Tyson suffered a laceration over his right eye, which extended down to 
his upper eyelid and went through to the bone," Trocki said. 
</P>
<P>
Trocki said the healing period would be a few weeks. King said he would meet 
with Donald Trump and HBO executives to decide on an October or November date 
to reschedule Tyson-Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very unfortunate that the fight has to be postponed," Tyson told the 
Associated Press. "I'm in the best shape of my life and have been training very 
hard for this fight. I have been waiting for the chance to fight Alex Stewart, 
but this is a temporary setback. I'm not going anywhere, neither is Alex. I'm 
sure when the time comes, we'll be ready to get it on." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-round fight had been scheduled for the Trump Plaza hotel on the same 
night Julio Cesar Chavez and Ahn Kyung-Duk were to meet with the World Boxing 
Council and International Boxing Federation junior-welterweight titles at 
stake.

Stewart said he was "terribly disappointed" when told of the postponement at 
his camp at Monticello, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working hard. I was ready to fight," Stewart told AP. "This is 
frustrating, but it's out of my hands. I'm going to win the fight sooner or 
later anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is 26-1, his only loss last November to Evander Holyfield. Stewart will 
return to his native Brooklyn, N.Y., until he resumes training.

<P>
Friday's mishap forced the second postponement of a Tyson fight in less than a 
year. He was to have fought Razor Ruddock in Edmonton, Canada, in November, 
1989, but became ill. That fight never was rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be Tyson's second fight since losing his title to Buster Douglas at 
Tokyo on Feb. 11. Tyson improved his record to 38-1 with a first-round knockout 
of Henry Tillman on June 16.

MARINOVICH, USC PASS THE FIRST TEST OF SEASON, 34-16;

<P>
Opening his sophomore season with the most productive game of his 13-game 
college football career, Todd Marinovich dazzled a crowd of 57,293 Friday night 
in his off-Broadway debut. 
</P>
<P>
Completing 25 of 35 passes for a career-best 337 yards and three touchdowns, 
Marinovich led USC to a 34-16 season-opening victory over Syracuse in Giants 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And his coach, Larry Smith, said afterward that Marinovich had been so bad in 
practice this week that Smith considered using an understudy. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when the Trojan running game produced only 100 net yards, Marinovich 
sliced up the Orangemen with his pinpoint passing, helping the Trojans win for 
only the second time in four openers under Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great performance by Todd," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Less impressive, but no less encouraging, was the play of the Trojan defense, 
which, save for a two-minute drill at the end of the first half, kept Syracuse 
out of the end zone and finally wore out the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of tools and they just kept beating up on us," Syracuse Coach 
Dick MacPherson said of the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
But three plays into the fourth quarter, the underdog Orangemen trailed by only 
24-13 and had the ball at USC's two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on second and goal, quarterback Marvin Graves, a redshirt freshman who 
had bedeviled the Trojans most of the game with his quickness, made a false 
move, bobbling the snap from center John Flannery. 
</P>
<P>
On third down from the four, with linebacker Matt Gee bearing down on him, 
Graves threw incomplete into the flat. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen had to settle for a field goal, the third of the night by kicker 
John Biskup, and the Trojans, helped along by three Syracuse penalties, scored 
in each of their last two possessions to win easily in their first appearance 
in the New York metropolitan area since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite honestly, I was mentally prepared for that," MacPherson said of the 
Trojans' defense. "It's awfully hard to get into the end zone against USC. 
People get down there, but they're so good and so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside the 25-yard line, their defense is one of the best in the country 
because of their athletes and how they play down there." 
</P>
<P>
It was its offense, though, that was expected to carry USC. 
</P>
<P>
But except for an 80-yard drive midway through the second quarter, the Trojans 
mostly sputtered in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans scored first, though, driving 19 yards after linebacker Craig 
Hartsuyker recovered a fumble by Syracuse running back Duane Kinnon, who lost 
control of the ball after taking a hit from Gee. 
</P>
<P>
USC scored on a 12-yard pass play from Marinovich to tailback Scott Lockwood on 
the first play of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a 25-yard field goal by Biskup cut the Syracuse deficit to 7-3, the 
Trojan offense came to life. 
</P>
<P>
A 22-yard pass from Marinovich to flanker Larry Wallace put the Trojans into 
Syracuse territory and Ricky Ervins, who would finish with 96 rushing yards in 
26 carries but to that point had been held to 10 yards in seven carries, 
followed with a 23-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins scored on a 22-yard pass play, taking a flare from Marinovich, who was 
in the sights of a pair of blitzing linebackers as he threw, and carrying the 
ball down the right sideline into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a 14-3 lead and seemingly in command, the Trojans then watched 
helplessly as Graves carved up their young secondary, driving the Orangemen 78 
yards in 71 seconds to a touchdown that cut the Trojans' lead to 14-10 with 59 
seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Running back David Walker scored the touchdown, taking a screen pass from 
Graves and carrying it 33 yards down the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, they were very confused," Smith said of his young players, 
including two redshirt freshmen starters, in the secondary. "We had quite a few 
missed checks. We were hanging by a thread. 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought in the second half, they played pretty well because we didn't 
have many breakdowns." 
</P>
<P>
And the Orange never made it into the end zone again. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded field goals to start the second half, putting the Trojans' 
lead at 17-13, but Marinovich was only warming up. 
</P>
<P>
He hooked up with flanker Gary Wellman on a 46-yard touchdown pass play. 
Wellman, who had seven receptions for 109 yards, easily beat cornerback Greg 
Walker on the play, making an over-the-shoulder catch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just waiting for that post (pattern) all game," Marinovich said. "It 
was there. I saw it and Gary saw it. All I had to do was get it to him. He did 
the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich feathered the pass and USC led, 24-13. 
</P>
<P>
USC scored its final touchdown with 36 seconds left, Ervins going two yards at 
the end of a 70-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Big difference from last year, that's for sure," Marinovich said, referring to 
a 14-13 loss to Illinois in last season's opener. "I was a lot more confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, it's good to have a good game. I thought I would. But you never know."

MIKE DOWNEY: HE HAS LEARNED SECRET OF THE CONFIDENCE GAME

The rallying cry of USC football this season -- In Todd We Trust -- is going to 
ring out louder and louder, week by week, coast to coast, if this is the way 
sophomore Todd Marinovich intends to play the position of quarterback, putting 
helpless defenses into a perpetual backpedal, penalizing hopeless opponents 
with an extremely legal use of the hands. 
</P>
<P>
The southpaw from the Southland threw for three touchdowns and 337 yards in 
USC's season opener Friday night, a 34-16 success against Syracuse in a Kickoff 
Classic that was a classic way to kick off a season. 
</P>
<P>
"How much?" Marinovich asked. 
</P>
<P>
Three-thirty-seven. 
</P>
<P>
"Geez, I didn't even know," he said. "Hey, that's all right." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, that's better than all right. This was a display that showed why there's 
definitely "Marino" to be found in Marinovich. Dan Marino was rarely better in 
his college days. The way Marinovich played before 57,293 at Giants Stadium 
brought about everybody, with the exception of stadium regular Jimmy Hoffa, who 
is supposedly buried around here someplace, to his or her feet. 
</P>
<P>
This was hardly the Marinovich who called the shots -- and took them -- in last 
season's opener, the loss to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"Different person completely," said Gary Wellman, who caught seven of his 
passes. "Totally different person. This is a Todd people didn't see in last 
year's opener. He's cool. He's under control. He's laughing out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time he was nervous, shaky, a little uneasy. Not anymore. Now he goes out 
there just to, you know, have a good time and play some football." 
</P>
<P>
That he did. The 46-yard touchdown pass play to Wellman was a thing of beauty 
and a joy to behold, for pitcher and catcher both. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was the quarterback's night. 
</P>
<P>
And we will be returning to Todd Marinovich in just a minute, because anybody 
who completes 25 of 35 passes in a season opener deserves to be talked about. 
</P>
<P>
But first, a few words about the rest of the gang, since this team looks to be 
a whole lot more than the Todd Squad. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. Todd always gets the credit," senior linebacker Scott Ross said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
A reasonable point. 
</P>
<P>
After all, since Ross and the rest of USC's hitters did their fair share 
against Orangemen, every guy in a red helmet had a perfect right to think of 
this successful season opener as a team-wide effort. 
</P>
<P>
Let's run that team highlight film, shall we? 
</P>
<P>
OK, here's linebacker Matt Gee stripping a ballcarrier and causing a fumble, 
and here he is again, planting the Syracuse quarterback near the USC goal. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's Marcus Hopkins making a last-man, score-saving tackle on Qadry (the 
Missile) Ismail on a Syracuse kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and here's a super play. This is Calvin Holmes, the kid who almost quit 
football a couple of years back, busting in on the punter, smothering the kick 
and returning it for a touchdown, although a penalty brought the ball back to 
where he blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
All right, look at this pass-blocking by All-American guard Mark Tucker and the 
rest of USC's relatively inexperienced offensive line, also known as the New 
Kids on the Blocks. 
</P>
<P>
And look at Scott Lockwood fight off those tackles on the way to paydirt with 
that 12-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Any more? 
</P>
<P>
Sure. Gold stars to Quin Rodriguez for his expert field-goal kicking, and how 
about one for Grant Runnerstrum, who kept the Missile on the pad by booming 
those kickoffs so deep into the end zone that they were unreturnable? 
</P>
<P>
"Good team game," headliner Marinovich had to agree. "We're tough. We've got a 
shot at it all." 
</P>
<P>
He knows there is Penn State ahead, and Washington, and Ohio State, etc. But 
it's a nice first step. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our passing game is ahead of last year already," said Marinovich, who 
meant it of his receivers as well as an honest appraisal of himself. "Tonight 
our running game wasn't so hot at first, but once we got our passing game 
working, our running game got going. It goes hand in hand." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich worked hard on his play-fakes, something he hadn't done much of 
before. Once he saw Syracuse bite, he and Wellman hooked up in the huddle and 
called the shot on their touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd said, 'Gary, this has got to go for a touchdown,' " Wellman said. "He 
said, 'The corner's playing wide and they're sucking up in the middle. We can 
make this work.' Then he laid it in perfect for me, right on the shoulder. He 
was cool all night that way. Put it right on the money." 
</P>
<P>
Sure did. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't last year, that's for sure," Marinovich said. "I couldn't wait to 
get on the field this time. I had a feeling it was all going to work." 
</P>
<P>
That's the best news of all at USC this season. 
</P>
<P>
Even Todd trusts in Todd.

SUIT AGAINST GOODWILL GAMES OFFICIALS SETTLED OUT OF COURT

Goodwill Games organizers are in imminent danger of going broke, a Carlsbad, 
Calif., company contended in documents filed shortly before settling a lawsuit 
seeking $800,000 for work at the Olympic-style event. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached Thursday night, hours after lawyers for 
International Events Management Ltd. released documents that contended the 
Seattle Organizing Committee had underestimated its debt by more than $1.18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Greenfield, a lawyer for the organizing committee, would not say whether 
the settlement left the group in a stronger financial position than when the 
suit was pending. 
</P>
<P>
In financial records released with Thursday's filing in King County Superior 
Court, organizers said the committee was $66,000 in the black and had the rest 
of the year to raise any additional funds needed. 
</P>
<P>
IEM said the committee's figures were "highly speculative and misleading" and 
accused organizers of minimizing outstanding debts and overstating potential 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is "in imminent danger of insolvency," IEM documents said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement preempted an IEM move to place the committee in receivership to 
ensure that any remaining funds go to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
IEM's Thursday filing said the company had no guarantee of collecting 
commissions it claimed for lining up corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the IEM documents: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Seattle Organizing Committee had to borrow $1 million last spring to 
keep the games afloat. The loan from Turner Broadcasting Systems of Atlanta, 
the games' corporate parent, remains unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee's claim of solvency depends on Turner waiving a debt of 
$300,000, a third of the royalties from souvenir sales. Organizers conceded 
they had yet to ask for a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tickets sales were $2 million less than the estimated $17.2 million needed 
to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee's finance director did not know if organizers could pay all 
bills now due, and the games' board of directors was advised that more 
fund-raising efforts would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Games officials contend they will end up in the black on their $68.5-million 
operating budget. A statement of the committee's finances showed remaining 
debts of $4.59 million with revenues of $4.66 million.

REDS GET DORAN, METS GET HERR IN TRADES; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: RED SOX ACQUIRE LARRY ANDERSEN AS CLUBS SCRAMBLE TO BEAT DEADLINE FOR 
POSTSEASON ELIGIBILITY.

<P>
Pennant contenders went on their annual shopping sprees Friday, making 
last-minute deals to beat the deadline for eligibility for postseason play, 
while non-contenders swapped veterans for prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Astros were a major dealer, sending reliever Larry Andersen to 
Boston for minor league third baseman Jeff Bagwell, 22, who is leading the 
double-A Eastern League in hitting. The Astros also sent veteran second baseman 
Bill Doran to their National League West rivals, the division-leading 
Cincinnati Reds, for three players to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for eligibility for postseason play was Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Doran deal came after he turned down a trade to the New York Mets, who then 
acquired another veteran second baseman, Tommy Herr, from the Philadelphia 
Phillies for two minor league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, 37, appeared in 50 games with Houston this season, compiling a 5-2 
record with six saves. 
</P>
<P>
Doran, 32, rejected the deal to the Mets, saying he didn't have enough time to 
consider the implications. The deal was conditional on the Mets being able to 
sign Doran, who can become a free agent after this season. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't do things at the last minute like (the clubs have) done, and then 
ask somebody to make a decision within a few hours (that determines) what your 
life is going to be like the next three or four years," Doran said. "That's no 
way to do business." 
</P>
<P>
Doran has played all 1,165 games of his major league career with the Astros 
since he came up to the majors in 1982. He was hitting .288 with six homers and 
32 RBIs for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who acquired veteran first baseman Pat Tabler from Kansas City late 
Thursday night, also got catcher Charlie O'Brien and a player to be named from 
Milwaukee for two players to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Herr, 34, is a lifetime .275 hitter over 12 seasons with St. Louis, Minnesota 
and the Phillies. He is hitting .264 this season with four homers and 50 RBIs 
and can become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little puzzled by the whole thing, but I've been traded before," Herr 
said. "I don't want to go to New York with a bad attitude like I did with 
Minnesota. I know all the players in New York and that will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was batting .186 in 145 at-bats with Milwaukee with no homers and 11 
RBIs. The Mets made room for him by releasing catcher Alex Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh sent right-handed pitcher Randy Kramer to Chicago for minor league 
right-hander Greg Kallevig.

Kevin Mitchell agreed to a four-year, $15-million contract with the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, voted the National League's most valuable player last season, will 
get a $1-million signing bonus and $3.5 million from 1991-1994, an average of 
$3.75 million per season plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
His deal matches that of teammate Will Clark, who signed for $3.75 million for 
each of four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' Jose Canseco is the highest-paid player at $23.5 million 
over five years, followed by the New York Yankees' Don Mattingly at $19.3 
million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, 28, is batting .303 with 30 home runs and 79 runs batted in. Last 
season, he batted .291 and led the league with 47 homers and 125 RBIs in 
helping the Giants win their first pennant since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"My performance is just going to get better," Mitchell said Friday. "I'm still 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I was good. I hope it just gets better. This is a happy moment."

GENENTECH, ROCHE CLEAR GOVERNMENT HURDLE TO MERGER

Genentech and Roche Holding have agreed to three conditions placed on their 
merger by the Federal Trade Commission and will complete the $2.1-billion deal 
by next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions are laid out in a consent decree that the companies and the FTC 
agreed to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech, the South San Francisco-based biotechnology company, said it must 
divest its interest in GLC Associates, a partnership it had formed to develop a 
recombinant process for making vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, must sell off technology it has been 
developing related to human growth hormone releasing factor. It also must 
license to third parties its patent rights to CD4, an AIDS drug also under 
development.

<P>
Friday's agreement with the FTC covered three technologies or products still in 
development stages, making it difficult to assess the order's financial impact 
on the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech hopes that the merger -- in which Roche will acquire 60% of the 
company initially and rights to purchase the remainder within five years -- 
will give it the deep pockets and global presence it needs to become the first 
entrepreneurial biotechnology company to enter the big leagues of 
pharmaceutical marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech said it was too early to predict what would happen to its 50% share 
of GLC, its joint venture with Lubrizol of Cleveland. GLC has no employees or 
revenue, and its only asset is its technology. The FTC apparently imposed the 
divestiture because Roche, through its subsidiaries, is a leader in the 
worldwide market for vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to the two Roche projects, the consent decree also addresses 
potential antitrust concerns, rather than current competitive conditions. Roche 
is still developing its growth hormone releasing factor, and it isn't expected 
that it would compete with Genentech's current growth hormone product in the 
one small market for which it is approved. There could be overlap in the 
future, however, because Genentech is exploring several different applications 
for its growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC also was concerned that each company was developing its own 
therapeutics for the CD4 portion of the AIDS virus. Genentech's CD4 product 
already is in clinical human trials. Roche's project -- which it now must 
license to others for marketing -- is a variant CD4 product that is still in 
early development. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agency began reviewing the antitrust implications of the merger 
after it was announced last February. The FTC extended the review in March when 
it asked for additional information on the three areas covered in the consent 
decree. Negotiations between the agency and the companies continued until 
Friday, when trade commissioners voted to accept the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered it to be well worth it to enter into the consent decree and 
complete the deal now," said Jack Murphy, a Genentech spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The infusion of capital from Roche will leave Genentech with a cash balance of 
$600 million, and allow it to simultaneously fund several projects in 
development, said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
This gives Genentech an edge over other independent biotech companies that 
often must shortchange promising technologies to afford the high cost of 
getting another through the development and regulatory review process. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech currently markets two genetically engineered products. Activase, its 
brand of tissue plasminogen activator, is used in treating heart attack 
patients. Protropin is used in treating children who suffer from growth hormone 
deficiency. The two products accounted for nearly 80% of the company's $400 
million in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
Roche Holding is the parent of a large group of research-based health care 
companies. In 1989, it had sales of about $6.4 billion.

OIL PRICES CLIMB AS TRADERS PLAY IT SAFE OVER WEEKEND

<P>
Oil prices rose for the second straight day Friday as traders, uncertain over 
what may happen next in the Persian Gulf, bought up supplies in advance of the 
Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for October delivery closed up 55 cents at $27.32 a barrel after 
rising 85 cents Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said buying picked up as the stalemate in the Middle East dragged on. 
Early waves of selling this week had been inspired by hopes for a quick 
negotiated settlement to the crisis, which has threatened the world's oil 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of war has eased but it's still lurking out there in case 
diplomatic overtures fail," one oil trader said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jonke with Cargill Investor Services Inc. estimated that up to 60% of 
the current strength in oil markets is directly related to fears of military 
action in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Tensions are still there, nervousness is still there. People expect some type 
of conclusion to this," Jonke said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's strongest move was in unleaded regular gasoline, which rose 7.25 cents 
to 96.32 cents per gallon for September contracts in their last day of trading 
on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil was up 0.35 cent to 75.89 cents per gallon, also on the last 
day of trading for September delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have seesawed this week as traders alternately looked to the Persian 
Gulf and to Vienna, where the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
met. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, oil prices fell as tensions seemed to cool in the Middle 
East. After OPEC's decision Wednesday to boost oil production, prices fell 
sharply but have since crept upward. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC allowed nations such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab 
Emirates to pump more oil to replace the 4 million barrels daily lost because 
of the U.N. embargo on Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Although the increases had been widely anticipated, even without an OPEC 
agreement, prices tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
But once the selling was out of the way traders again focused on tensions in 
the gulf, and prices began to climb again. 
</P>
<P>
"Four weeks after Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait, the future 
developments in the region are as uncertain as ever," said a report from oil 
brokers E .D. &amp; F. Man International. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the October Brent crude, a world benchmark, was quoted at $26.50 a 
barrel, up 55 cents from Thursday's New York close. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was thin on both the New York and London oil markets. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some traders were keeping prices up as they bought futures Friday 
to avoid getting caught short over the long weekend. New York financial markets 
are closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts are predicting a tight market for gasoline and heating oil 
next month due to supply disruptions in the Middle East and strong military 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a shortage of refining capacity in the world, and the situation in 
the Middle East has really affected those refineries," said Bernard Picchi, an 
analyst with Salomon Bros. A daily refining capacity of 1.3 million barrels has 
been taken off the world market because of the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East is not just a big crude oil exporting region. It's also a big 
products exporting region," Picchi said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are distinct concerns that product availability will be limited by the 
loss of exports from Iraq and Kuwait and a possible strike in Brazil," said 
Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian oil workers have set a strike date of Sept. 4 unless state-owned 
Petrobras improves its offer of an 83% wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Energy Department, Brazil accounted for just under 10% of all 
gasoline imports to the United States, or about 50,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The lastest oil industry stock report puts U.S. gasoline inventories at 210.9 
million barrels, the lowest level since July 29, 1988. And refinery utilization 
rates are considered to be almost at maximum levels, 92.4% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the United States does not suffer from a refinery capacity 
crunch.

BUSINESS WORRIES THAT CONSUMERS, FRETTING OVER GULF, WILL DELAY BUYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
As retailers prepare their Labor Day sales, fears are growing that consumers -- 
worried about higher oil prices and the volatile Persian Gulf -- may hold back 
on buying, dealing a blow to the already fragile U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Hard data on the public's purchasing behavior since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait is not yet available. In interviews, some retailers and lenders reported 
little change from the lackluster pace of June and July. 
</P>
<P>
Yet other signs suggest concern in corporate America. Consumer confidence in 
August took its largest drop in more than seven years, the Conference Board 
reported earlier this week. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and other retailers are 
scaling down plans to order fall and winter items. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, retailers have been quick to discount fall goods, a clear signal 
that they are worried about business. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the economic uncertainties generated by the Middle East crisis, a loss 
in the consumer's sense of security is inevitable," declared Fabian Linden, 
executive director of the Consumer Research Center at the Conference Board, a 
New York business research organization. 
</P>
<P>
Any cutback in consumer purchases would be highly significant, because the 
economy has barely grown at all in recent months. In what would be a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, such a spending cutback could trigger the feared 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a great sense of nervousness about what's going to happen next, 
which should make them more cautious about their spending -- and could tip the 
economy into a recession," warns David Hale, an economist with Kemper Financial 
Services in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
A key difference between now and the oil shocks of the 1970s is that women have 
largely completed their move into the work force, said James E. Newton, 
president of Economic Perspectives, a retail consulting firm in Delaware, Ohio. 
As a result, the huge market for women's career apparel is no longer growing as 
fast and consumer cutbacks "will hit everybody" this time. 
</P>
<P>
The worries appear widespread: In a survey of 450 U.S. households shortly after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Chicago market research firm found that 62% think this 
isn't a good time for major purchases, up from 51% in July. The number 
expecting prices to rise in the next few months almost doubled to 50% from 26% 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are telling themselves, "I want to hold back. I want to be cautious," 
said George Rosenbaum, president of Chicago-based Leo J. Shapiro &amp; 
Associates, which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is difficult to separate the concerns arising from the 
Middle East crisis from earlier signs of a faltering economy. "Like other 
retailers in the current environment, we're just being prudent in our buying 
plans," said Mary Jean Houde, a spokeswoman for Sears. 
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of pre-Labor Day sales promotions for fall attire appears to be 
a sign of weak consumer interest, observed Alan G. Millstein, publisher of 
Fashion Network Report, a trade publication in New York. He also noted a lack 
of major fashion trends as another clue to a lackluster buying climate. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was going to be a poor Christmas, this can make it a worse than poor 
Christmas," Millstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile dealers nationwide reported sluggish sales of domestic cars and 
trucks during August, but attributed the decline to an overall industry 
sluggishness rather than Persian Gulf tension. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, surprisingly, so far we've seen few signs of it having an impact 
on sales," said Tom Webb, chief economist with the National Assn. of Automobile 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic auto sales of 247,000 units reflected a decline of 18% during the 
first 10 days of August compared to the same period last year, and volume for 
the second 10 days fell 5% to 261,000 units, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
At Ted Jones Ford in Buena Park, sales manager Mel Marquec said the dealership 
sold about 280 cars in August compared to 300 in July, but he hesitated to 
attribute the decline to the Middle East. "If sales were off 50 to 75 cars, 
then I'd say it had a noticable effect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms may actually be benefiting from the jittery climate. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Crawford, president of the Breuners Furniture Rental chain, said some 
of his 40 stores in California and Nevada picked up rental orders last month 
from customers who originally planned to buy new office furniture. 
</P>
<P>
These customers, Crawford said, changed plans apparently because they were 
"concerned about obligating themselves" to a big investment in new furniture. 
In August, Breuners' office furniture rentals were up 11% from the year-ago 
month. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Marshalls, a big off-price clothing chain based in Andover, 
Mass., said her store managers haven't noticed any drop in business since the 
Aug. 2 invasion. Still, she noted, business has been miserable for many 
retailers ever since late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Around New England, stores are now slashing prices right and left, competing 
for the back-to-school dollar," said the spokeswoman, Karin Whiting. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect is uneven. At Beverly Hills-based Great Western Bank, "our loan 
volume has remained very good in August, as strong as it was in May, June or 
July," said Ian Campbell, a spokesman for the Beverly Hills-based thrift. He 
said a sustained increase in interest rates could take a toll on loan volume. 
</P>
<P>
With a little imagination, however, some can envision world events acting as a 
plus for the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis can serve as a powerful symbol, with its outcome affecting overall 
confidence for better or worse, said Bernard Codner, director of the Institute 
of Retail Management at California State University, Los Angeles. "If America 
comes out of this a clear winner, it could pump people up psychologically so 
much that it could give a real spurt to the economy," he said.

SAV-ON DRUG SETTLES FALSE-ADVERTISING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE CHAIN WILL PAY FINES AND EXPENSES OF $110,000. IT SAYS EMPLOYEE 
ERRORS LED TO THE OVERCHARGES IN QUESTION. 
</P>

<P>
Sav-on Drug's owner agreed Friday to pay $110,000 in fines and expenses to 
settle charges that the chain overcharged customers on merchandise advertised 
at special sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office follows 
similar false-advertising cases brought in recent years against K mart and 
Thrifty Corp., the state's biggest drugstore chain. 
</P>
<P>
Sav-on blamed the overcharges on employee errors, and said it is installing 
computerized cash registers as part of its effort to eliminate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Healey said the investigation of Sav-on was launched 
in July, 1989, when county agents checked 14 of the chain's drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators, responding to a consumer complaint, bought items at random 
to determine whether the prices paid at the cash register matched advertised 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Investigators were charged higher-than-advertised prices at 13 of 
the 14 stores. They were overcharged on 81 of the 230 items they bought, paying 
$1,074 on goods advertised at $944. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Miller, the Sav-on spokesman, said the case involved "lack of 
communication" among store employees. "We've taken substantial steps to make 
sure it doesn't happen again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Healey said, "was genuinely apologetic and seemed anxious to clear 
up the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Along with accepting the fines and negotiated penalties, Sav-on agreed to a 
five-year injunction against false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Healey said the company could be subject to huge penalties if it is ever found 
to deliberately violate the injunction, with fines of as much as $2,500 for 
every customer who is overcharged. 
</P>
<P>
Sav-on, with 163 locations in California, is the state's third-largest 
drugstore chain and is second in Southern California only to Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
Sav-on is operated by American Drug Stores, which in turn is owned by Salt Lake 
City-based American Stores. Other American Stores holdings include Lucky and 
Alpha Beta supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar false advertising case settled in 1987, Thrifty agreed to pay 
penalties of $117,940 after a year of negotiations with the Los Angeles County 
District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, K mart agreed to pay Los Angeles, Kern and Kings counties $450,457 
in connection with an overcharging case.

Coors Being Investigated by Colorado: State prosecutors have begun a criminal 
investigation into alleged ground-water pollution by the Adolph Coors Co., 
according to a news report. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocky Mountain News carried the state's confirmation in Friday editions. It 
said investigators were reviewing allegations that plant officials knowingly 
concealed leaking pipes at a Golden can plant that tainted at least two and as 
many as five underground springs with the toxic chemical solvent TCA in the 
1970s and early 1980s. The brewery released details of the pollution in 
February, along with a five-year, $1 million clean-up program.

Army Delays Decision: The Army said it will delay for two years a decision on 
whether to proceed with a $6.1-billion anti-aircraft missile system made by 
Martin Marietta Corp. to let the company fix problems with the system. The 
military wants to purchase 378 of the vehicles armed with anti-aircraft 
missiles and guns, but said the vehicle itself, not the weapons, had been 
suffering mechanical problems.

SAUDI ARAMCO DENIES ANY EXODUS OF FOREIGN WORKERS

<P>
Saudi Arabia's main oil production company denied Friday that nearly 600 of its 
foreign workers resigned because of fears of war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi press agency quoted an official source at Saudi Aramco as 
saying the report, carried by Reuters from Dhahran Thursday, was "completely 
baseless." 
</P>
<P>
A Saudi executive at Aramco told Reuters on Thursday that about 600 foreign 
workers, fearing the imminent outbreak of war in the Gulf, had resigned and 
many more were expected to go. 
</P>
<P>
The executive, who asked not to be named, said he believed that the number may 
double or triple in the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi press agency quoted an unnamed official as saying there was no rush 
by foreigners to leave the company: 
</P>
<P>
"The average departure (of foreign workers) at the end of their contracts . . . 
is normal. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of workers who are arriving in the kingdom to participate in the 
new expansion process are more than those who are departing," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. denied Thursday that any of its employees working for Saudi 
Aramco were leaving after tens of thousands of U.S. and mainly Arab troops 
arrived in eastern Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the workers) are staying . . . We have 61 workers there on a contract 
basis. About 40 of them are there now and the rest are on vacation and will 
return," Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives said Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, issued 
orders last week to pump more oil to help fill a gap caused by shortages from 
Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Aramco, which employs about 32,000 Saudis, has 3,000 American workers, 
compared to about 6,000 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Many foreigners working for the company sent their families home during the 
early days of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

GRADCO SYSTEMS DELAYS MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Gradco Systems Inc., a maker of copier and printer products, postponed its 
annual shareholders meeting Friday and said it will fight an attempt by a tiny 
New York publisher to seek representation on the Irvine firm's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Plenum Publishing Corp., which owns 8.9% of Gradco, said in a 
filing last week that it plans to nominate at least one outside director to 
Gradco's board. Gradco currently has no outside directors. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash filed a civil lawsuit on Aug. 24 against Keith 
B. Stewart, Gradco's chairman, and the company's directors for allegedly 
granting themselves warrants to buy a 17% stake in the company's valuable new 
Japanese subsidiary at below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We will solicit proxies to replace the board of directors of Gradco," said 
Bernard Bressler, Plenum's corporate counsel and secretary. He said, however, 
that the New York firm has no plans to acquire a controlling interest in 
Gradco. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said it would seek to nominate its own outside director at the annual 
meeting, which was abruptly rescheduled for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, Plenum alleges 
that Stewart and company directors conspired to misappropriate for their own 
benefit one of the company's most valuable assets -- its Japanese subsidiary, 
worth an estimated $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Gradco spokesman declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Stewart, the suit names Gradco officers Joseph Sanchez, president and 
chief operating officer, and Mark M. Takeuchi, president and chief executive of 
Gradco Japan. It also names two company directors, Thomas J. O'Keefe and Horst 
O. Sieben. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the scheme arose from Gradco's reorganization this 
spring, in which it divided itself into two operating subsidiaries, Gradco 
Printer Systems Inc., a money-losing printer products unit, and Gradco Japan 
Ltd., which consisted of the company's lucrative copier products sales and was 
96%-owned by the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the restructuring, Gradco discontinued manufacturing in Santa Ana 
and shifted its production to Japan and South Korea.

NEW TESTS CONFIRM IT: AIR BAGS REALLY HELP; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION NOTED A SHARP 
REDUCTION IN HEAD AND CHEST INJURIES WHEN THE DEVICES ARE USED.

<P>
Drivers protected by air bags are significantly less vulnerable to head and 
chest injury in accidents, new tests indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Results released Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
indicated that a front-seat passenger in the Chrysler LeBaron two-door 
convertible is nearly seven times as likely to sustain head injury as the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chrysler Imperial, a four-door sedan, the passenger is four times as 
vulnerable as the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Both cars have air bags on the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
The agency tested 34 vehicles ranging from subcompacts to luxury sedans and 
light trucks, releasing its final round of crash test results for 1990 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said it was difficult to draw conclusions from 
the tests because they were based on crashes under conditions that exceed 
government safety standards, but he said air bags have a major impact on safety 
and are needed for passengers as well as drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (in the auto industry) has indicated that's the direction they're 
going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The government tested the vehicles by driving them head-on into a fixed 
barrier, creating the same conditions as a frontal collision between two 
identical vehicles driving at 35 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions also are equivalent to a car moving at 70 m.p.h. striking an 
identical parked car. 
</P>
<P>
Test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and, in certain cars, air 
bags. Tests are conducted using dummies that represent an average-size adult 
male. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NHTSA index, a score of 750 or lower means head injury is 
unlikely; 750 to 1,250 means head injury is possible, and anything higher means 
head injury is likely. 
</P>
<P>
A separate scale records the possibility of chest injury, which is considered 
likely when the score tops 60. 
</P>
<P>
The lower the numbers, the lower the potential for injury. But for purposes of 
comparison, vehicles have to be of the same type and weigh within 500 pounds of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler LeBaron's score for driver head injury was 298, well below the 
threshold for likely injury. But the front-seat passenger score was 2,043. 
Chest injury scores were 40 for the driver and 46 for the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
In the Imperial, the driver head injury score was 517 while the passenger head 
injury score was 2,132. 
</P>
<P>
Rated highest of all vehicles tested for potential driver head injury was the 
Ford Club Wagon van, with a score of 2,613. Its passenger score was 1,896. 
</P>
<P>
The Isuzu Trooper II had the highest potential injury score for the front-seat 
passenger -- 1,952. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevrolet S-10 Blazer had the highest driver chest injury score -- 74. The 
highest passenger injury score was the Trooper II's 64. 
</P>
<P>
The agency released eight crash test results Friday, including those of the 
Imperial and LeBaron. Others included: 
</P>
<P>
* Chevrolet Cavalier four-door sedan. Head injury: 770 driver, 485 passenger. 
Chest injury: 49 driver, 37 passenger. 
</P>
<P>
* Subaru Legacy four-door sedan. Head: 1,007 driver, 675 passenger. Chest: 52 
driver, 44 passenger. 
</P>
<P>
* Cadillac Deville four-door sedan. Head: 423 driver, no data available for 
passenger. Chest: 39 driver, 46 passenger. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeep Cherokee four-door. Head: 943 driver, 841 passenger. Chest: 58 driver, 
52 passenger. 
</P>
<P>
* Dodge Dakota two-door pickup. Head: 1,169 driver, 558 passenger. Chest: 57 
driver, 56 passenger. 
</P>
<P>
* Pontiac Trans Sport van. Head: 761 driver, 595 passenger. Chest: 42 driver, 
37 passenger.

JAPAN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS SHRINKS 63% IN JULY 
</P>

Surprisingly robust imports helped shrink Japan's current account balance of 
payments surplus, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, by more 
than half in July, and economists say the trend could continue if oil prices 
rise further. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry reported Friday that the current account, the widest 
measure of a nation's trade in goods and services, shrank 63.27% to an 
unadjusted $2.02-billion surplus in July, from $5.50 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Finance official told reporters that Friday's figures support the 
view that Japan's current account surplus is in a declining trend, although 
there have been monthly variations. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said robust imports and a surprisingly large deficit in invisible 
trade were responsible for the month's sharp decline. 
</P>
<P>
Within the overall current account, the merchandise trade surplus narrowed 
22.9% to $5.42 billion from $7.03 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Imports rose 12% to $17.92 billion from $16 billion a year earlier. Economists 
attributed part of the gain to higher oil prices but said Japan's insatiable 
appetite for foreign art also boosted the imports figure. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the official said the ratio of imported manufactured goods to overall 
imports was 54.4% in July, a record after a former high of 52.4% in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Exports were $23.33 billion, against $23.03 billion a year ago, easing concern 
that Japanese industry was about to pour more products into nations already 
sensitive to trade imbalances.

RICK DU BROW: END OF THE OLD BOY NETWORKS?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A LATINO AND A WOMAN NOW HEAD NEWS OPERATIONS AT CHANNELS 2 AND 4. 
BUT WILL THEIR STATIONS' COVERAGE CHANGE?

Winds of change. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a woman and a Latino are news directors of two of Los Angeles' three 
major network TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
When Jose Rios was named news director of KCBS Channel 2 this week, he became 
the only Latino to hold that post at one of the town's seven top 
English-language TV outlets. 
</P>
<P>
When Nancy Valenta was named news director of KNBC Channel 4 six months ago, 
she became the first woman to get that job at a network station in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Winds of change. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, also, a black executive, Johnathan Rodgers, is the new president of 
CBS' stations division. 
</P>
<P>
When Rodgers was appointed boss this week of CBS-owned-and-operated stations in 
Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Miami, he became the first 
black to head up a major division at one of the Big Three networks. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, meanwhile, another black, Jennifer Lawson, was put in charge of 
PBS programming as executive vice president of national production. 
</P>
<P>
While it's hardly time to send up the balloons and declare that TV's long 
history of inequality is over -- because it isn't -- a new world is clearly 
dawning. 
</P>
<P>
True, the number of women and minorities in top TV management still is 
piddling. 
</P>
<P>
But for women, for instance, the determination of such pioneers as Stephanie 
Brady, former news director of independent station KHJ Channel 9 (before it 
became KCAL), is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
There's a danger, however. 
</P>
<P>
With growing pressure to crack open and democratize TV's executive suites, 
there are always touchy and nasty suggestions that people may be getting key 
jobs because they are women or minorities. 
</P>
<P>
This nerve-end issue apparently was on the mind of KCBS General Manager Robert 
Hyland when he appointed Rios. The station's license had been threatened by 
Latino critics of KCBS hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Esther Renteria, chair of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, 
Hyland not only defended KCBS' hiring record but -- because of strained 
relations with the group -- felt compelled to add: 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I find it necessary to stress what would otherwise go 
without saying: Jose has earned this job entirely on his own merits, and in 
fairness to him, I hope it will not be suggested otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for TV stations to hire on-air talent of various backgrounds 
to appeal to specific audiences in specific cities. Asian American anchors, for 
instance, are considered good TV business in such Pacific Rim cities as Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But understandably, both on-air personnel and executives who may be women or 
minorities have a right to be infuriated at having to undergo scrutiny the old 
boys never had to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, for instance, is a solid 12-year veteran at KCBS whose professionalism 
needs no defense from Hyland. 
</P>
<P>
The facts about Rios speak for themselves -- assistant news director at KCBS 
since 1987, assignment editor and winner of a number of awards. 
</P>
<P>
But while KCBS defends its record on minorities, it has seemed to react to 
Latino criticism over the last few years. Perhaps it was good intentions. 
Perhaps it was fear of having its license jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, press releases from KCBS seemed, more than ever before, to 
emphasize the Latino appointments, tie-ins with Latino doings around town and 
good deeds for Latino causes. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland's letter to Renteria on Tuesday, responding to a letter from her, was 
angry, but the depth of his concern on the Latino issue was indicated by the 
following passage: 
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginnings of my tenure (as general manager) in 1987, KCBS-TV has 
taken numerous steps and achieved specific results in terms of addressing 
employment and other Hispanic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, among other things, we have: increased the presence of Hispanics 
both in front of and behind the camera in our news department; achieved greater 
outreach to the Hispanic community, including close involvement with a number 
of Hispanic organizations and activities; strengthened our regular and special 
programming coverage of issues of interest and concern to Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
It would be fair to say that, by whatever motivation, KCBS' consciousness was 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
And it was not the only station in town to feel the sting of threats -- or 
realize the enormous financial clout wielded by Los Angeles' vast, 
television-watching Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Rios and Valenta -- who is not a Latina -- are news directors at two 
of L.A.'s three biggest stations, what will they do over the long run? Will TV 
look any different, make any new priorities? Will Rios bring even more KCBS 
attention to Latino life here? Why shouldn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Or will nothing change in local TV except for the fact that there is a female 
news director at KNBC and a Latino news director at KCBS? On taking over at 
KNBC, Valenta said she felt the two top local news stories of the 1990s would 
be crime and the environment. She never mentioned women's issues. The station's 
news doesn't look much different now than it did six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Valenta's boss is a highly successful, iron-fisted general manager named John 
Rohrbeck, who wields major power in the NBC structure. It is not likely that 
she can do more than he allows. As for Rios, we will see shortly just how much 
leeway he has under Hyland, and what direction the station's news will take. 
</P>
<P>
There is one story that no TV station covers enough -- the new Los Angeles 
emerging as a Third World city. There is a new, emerging audience waiting to 
see this story properly presented. That is the big story.

L.A. FEST OPENS TODAY: IT'S A HAPPENING; 
</P>
<P>
GUIDE: MORE THAN 2,000 ARTISTS FROM 21 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE 
17-DAY FESTIVAL, WHICH EXPLORES THE ART AND CULTURE OF PACIFIC RIM NATIONS. 
EVENTS WILL BE HELD AT 230 SITES. ABOUT 70% OF THE PERFORMANCES ARE FREE.

<P>
First, there was the name: "The Los Angeles Festival." This begged the 
question: "The Los Angeles Festival of what?" 
</P>
<P>
Then was born The Program That No One Could Read. The festival's hip, exotic, 
provocative and bright-hued program/ticket guide features cosmic essays on art, 
life and culture in dark letters over dark backgrounds, while little details 
like times, dates and places are cleverly disguised. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the festival banners, which recently appeared around the Los Angeles 
area and look like giant postage stamps from Mars. In fact, they look just like 
the program -- only bigger. 
</P>
<P>
But today, after months of financial struggling, the Los Angeles Festival is 
officially opening. Beginning at 10 a.m. with an all-day seaside celebration at 
San Pedro's Point Fermin/Angel's Gate Park, for the next 16 days the L.A. area 
will be engulfed in a huge artistic and cultural experiment. About 100,000 
visitors are expected at the parks over the three-day Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, say festival planners, is to simply let the Los Angeles Festival 
happen to you -- to become an eager cultural sponge soaking up the sights and 
sounds of 21 countries, representing 1,400 artists from the Pacific Rim plus 
800 more from Los Angeles. The approach, they suggest, is spontaneity, 
receptivity, experimentation and participation. 
</P>
<P>
But for those to whom the phrase letting it happen conjures up images of 
freeway accidents, the following is a guide to unraveling the mystery of Los 
Angeles Festival 1990. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IS IT? Sept.1-17. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT IS IT?: A celebration of the arts of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE'S THIS PACIFIC?: Commonly called the Pacific Rim (those countries which 
rim the Pacific Ocean), the Pacific includes all our neighbors along the ocean 
-- and beyond. The Pacific Rim phrase has become something of a buzzword for 
Los Angeles in the 1990s, because that's the area from which most of the city's 
immigrants hail, as well as the cultures experts predict will explode onto the 
American scene in upcoming decades. The festival celebrates Asian, Pacific, and 
Latino art and culture. Some of the areas include: Mexico, El Salvador, Peru, 
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Colombia, the Philippines, Canada, Cambodia, Hawaii, 
Indonesia, Korea, China, Tonga, Japan, India, Samoa, Vietnam, New Zealand, 
Polynesia, Thailand, Australia and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT IS ITS HISTORY?: The Los Angeles Festival is an offshoot of the 1984 
Olympic Arts Festival. The first Los Angeles Festival was held in 1987, 
celebrating the arts of Europe; this is Los Angeles' first attempt to explore 
the other half of the world. Festival director Peter Sellars sees the Los 
Angeles Festival as a 10-year project, focusing on a different area of the 
world each year. Next year, he has said the festival will focus on Africa and 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
IS THIS FESTIVAL DANCE OR MUSIC OR WHAT?: A little of everything. Dance, 
ancient rituals, American Indian powwows, theater, performance art, video, 
visual arts, processions, puppets (giant, miniature, shadow), musicians, 
children's entertainment and food from 80 countries. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE IS IT?: Everywhere. festival events take place at 230 different 
locations. Theaters, galleries, temples, lofts, storefronts, parks, streets, 
piers, gardens, college campuses and even a Santa Monica Air Center hangar will 
be host to events. 
</P>
<P>
However, the main events take place on weekends at three locations: Point 
Fermin/Angel's Gate Park for the Labor Day weekend; Griffith Park Sept. 8-9 and 
Santa Monica Pier Sept. 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
DO I HAVE TO PAY TO GET IN?: About 70% of festival events are free. Thirty 
percent are ticketed performances. For information on festival events, call 
(213) 688-ARTS; for ticket information call (213) 623-7400. 
</P>
<P>
HOW DO I GET THERE?: Besides your car, special city bus routes have been added 
for weekends (call 1-800-2LA-RIDE for information). At Point Fermin/Angel's 
Gate Park, signs from the freeway will direct you to parking sites, and shuttle 
buses -- complete with live entertainers aboard -- will take you to festival 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
CAN I WATCH IT ON TV?: Sort of. On weekdays, public broadcasting station KCET 
Channel 28 has a special series of late-night festival-related programming. 
KCET also just added repeats of "Los Angeles Festival: An Explorer's Guide," a 
half-hour featuring Sellars explaining the event, at 6 p.m. tonight, 10:30 a.m. 
Sunday and midnight Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND?: The festival officially begins at 10 a.m. with 
a Native American blessing and gift ceremony involving 186 performers from 
around the world -- but this is not open to the public. Festival officials says 
the public need not arrive earlier than 11 a.m., when the Vendors Village, 
featuring crafts and food booths representing 80 countries, open. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the public events officially begin with the ringing of the park's 
Korean Peace Bell. After that ceremony, a 45-minute artists procession takes 
place to Point Fermin Park's Pacific Stage. Taking part are the Woomera 
Mornington Islanders of Australia; the Wallis &amp; Futuna Music and Dance 
Group; New Mexico's Jemez Pueblo Matachines; Korea's Chindo Shamans; 
California's Cahuilla Bird Singers and the King Island Inupiat Singers and 
Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
From 1-6 p.m., the parks will host a "spiritual jam session" featuring 25 
groups which also offer individual performances throughout the park. Open 
Festival events begin at nearby Wilder Park at 12:30 p.m. The parks close at 
dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the Labor Day weekend include Sunday's Moon Festival in 
Chinatown (free); various performances Saturday and Sunday at the African 
Marketplace at Rancho Cienega Park and various performances Sunday on Olvera 
Street. And the Korean shamans, ritual healers from Korea's Chindo Islands, 
have added a performance at Pacific Asia Museum Monday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 
2 p.m. at Koreatown Plaza.

newspapers don't exist and only three hotels are in business. 
</P>
<P>
Isolation has allowed much of the beauty and grace of Wallis and Futuna islands 
to remain out in the middle of Polynesia for decades. 
</P>
<P>
A French Overseas Territory since 1961, three islands make up the three 
kingdoms ruled by three tribal chiefs who speak different languages -- 
Wallisian/East Uvean, East Futunan and French. Separated by 150 miles, Wallis 
and Futuna are geographically Polynesian, but culturally and linguistically 
related to Samoa and Tonga. The island of Alofi is uninhabited. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, 30,000 Americans were stationed on Wallis, then known as 
Uvea. With no written language in their culture, the islanders regard 
storytelling and oratory as important parts of life and when tales are set to 
music and accompanied by dance, they play a significant role in social, 
political and religious interaction. 
</P>
<P>
Some 28 singers and dancers from Wallis and Futuna make their U.S. debut today 
at the free opening festival ceremonies at Angel's Gate. 
</P>
<P>
As they would in previous festivals, whether a celebration of South Pacific 
arts or a village celebration, the group will greet their hosts with a to'o 
kava, a religious ritual in which gifts are traditionally offered first to the 
gods, then respectfully to their hosts, then to other L.A. Festival performers. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the troupe will share its culture in a kava ceremony that is 
traditionally a part of all gatherings and ceremonies of importance in 
Polynesia. Kava is a root which, when prepared and drunk, has a mildly 
intoxicating effect. The origins of this ceremony come either from Samoa or 
Tonga, symbolizing a link to their ancestral past. Audiences will be invited to 
sample the kava, thus becoming a part of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Songs composed for the festival will accompany the preparation of the drink. 
The laulausiva is a song of greeting to the audience from the performers as 
well as those left behind in Wallis and Futuna. The lyrics express their joy of 
participating in the festival and acknowledging the audience and its importance 
to the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, performances will focus on warrior and action dances, 
which are performed only by the men. Wearing skirts, shoulder coverings and 
headbands of red and white pandanus fiber, they are accompanied by drums as 
they hold paddles and clubs to embody strength and energy. The kailao 
originated in the village of Vailala on the island of Wallis and was executed 
before going into combat as a kind of pep talk before battle. The tu'upaki 
focuses on the warrior's club and the eke demonstrates various movements and 
postures seen in warfare. 
</P>
<P>
But the women also dance. In the soamako, their bodies, heads and eyes move 
with grace to a softer, lilting drum beat. Men and women dance together in the 
sasa, which mimics combat, fishing, canoeing, gardening and household chores.

DANCE: THE KING ISLANDERS FROM ALASKA RESCUED A WAY OF LIFE THAT ALMOST 
VANISHED IN THE '60S, PERFORMING SONGS THAT ORIGINATED WITH THEIR ANCESTORS 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Tiulana was sitting at his kitchen table in the city, reaching into the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Back there on King Island," he said, recalling the tiny Bering Sea settlement 
on which he was born, "back there, you need some kind of entertainment. Long 
winters. We danced." 
</P>
<P>
It's been 24 years now since the government moved Tiulana, his family and their 
neighbors off King Island -- 24 years since they scattered to Anchorage and 
Nome and other points south, places with better schools, better housing, less 
dangerous weather. 
</P>
<P>
One thing has kept the community alive in the years since -- Eskimo song and 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana, 68, is the founder and leader of the King Island Inupiat Singers and 
Dancers, one of Alaska's better-known native performance troupes. In a state 
where traditional song and dance remain an important, living part of culture in 
many Eskimo and Indian settlements, the King Island group has become one of the 
most traveled, performing in Washington, London, Siberia and throughout their 
home state. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the King Islanders arrive in Southern California for the Los Angeles 
Festival, which officially opens Saturday at Angel's Gate and Point Fermin 
Park. They will be among native performers from throughout the Pacific who are 
scheduled to participate in opening ceremonies at a variety of venues through 
Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
With pulsing rhythms from walrus-skin drums, the 20-member King Island group 
performs songs that originated with their ancestors thousands of years ago. 
Songs celebrate successful hunts, relate myths, pass on information. In the 
Inupiat world, without a written language, songs and dance were how history and 
values were passed on from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
For the King Islanders, especially Tiulana, his wife and the two other older 
couples that form the group's core, the leap from aboriginal villagers to 
performers sometimes seems like a journey across millennia. 
</P>
<P>
King Island is a mountaintop poking out of the icy waters 35 miles off the 
western Alaska coast. The 200-or-so residents lived off the land and the sea 
with little contact with the white world until earlier this century. They lived 
in tiny, ramshackle houses on stilts clinging to a steep hillside above the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The dances evolved within the limits of the cramped environment -- crouches 
with intense hand and arm movement that became more frenetic as the intensity 
of the music grew, but which needed almost no floor space. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana was raised to be a polar-bear hunter. He used some of the Stone Age 
tools of his ancestors. He stored his game in a cave. He grew to be a man on a 
King Island diet of walrus, bearded seal, puffin soup and wild greens. 
</P>
<P>
Then World War II came along and Tiulana was drafted into the Army and 
simultaneously catapulted into 20th-Century American society. He visited the 
mainland for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he returned to the island, married and raised seven children. But 
by the 1960s, King Island was becoming a ghost town. People began drifting away 
to easier lives elsewhere. A tuberculosis epidemic hit. The Department of the 
Interior finally closed the school and the Tiulanas were relocated in Nome, 90 
miles away. Paul went to work as a janitor in a bank. The Inupiat culture began 
to slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost lost it," Tiulana said recently. But then, a few years ago, he had 
an idea: Why not get the King Islanders together and dance, like the old days? 
They rented a community hall and everyone had a blast. They started getting 
together regularly until the dance group became a sort of government-in-exile 
for the villagers without a village, a way to remember who they were in a 
changing world. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana and other islanders traveled to Anchorage, performing their dances and 
selling ivory carvings. Business was good. The family decided to stay and the 
King Island troupe was born. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like starting a new life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on King Island prepared the Tiulanas for their new life in the city. 
Paul learned to drive a truck in Nome, but recalls the terror of pulling his 
car into city traffic in those days. His wife, Clara, always sat next to him 
with a big road map unfolded, navigating their course through town. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many more rules and regulations living in the city," he said. "Out 
at King Island, we were more independent." 
</P>
<P>
But the Tiulanas adapted. Paul made a living as an artist. Eventually the 
National Endowment for the Arts honored him with a Heritage Award, and two 
years ago he published his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulanas are a study in cultural contrasts. Clara sits in the living room 
of their modest Anchorage home watching a game show on television while sewing 
a pair of boots out of the hide of a bearded seal, hunted by a son earlier this 
year. The rich, fishy aroma of seal oil, a staple of the Eskimo diet, fills the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Clara occasionally break into Inupiat, one of three major Eskimo 
dialects still spoken here. Their children speak the language, too, although 
the grandchildren understand little of what they say. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulana grandchildren have recently become more involved with the dance 
group to learn about their roots, he said. His daughter, Lillian, a computer 
programmer for an oil company, points out that they have done so with the help 
of videocassettes and a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulana daughters are all college graduates who have gone on to 
professional careers. The sons became ivory carvers and followed their father's 
path. Each spring, some of them return to Alaska's western coast to purchase 
ivory and join the hunts for walrus and seal. Sometimes, on a rare calm day, 
they take a skiff out into the sea to visit the island they were born. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the grandchildren, who never lived on the island, the songs and dances 
are threads connecting them to a past they otherwise have trouble 
comprehending. It's a thread more native people in Alaska are looking to as a 
way to make sense of dizzying cultural change. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tiulana is particularly proud of his 14-year-old grandson, Edward, an 
up-and-coming star of the King Island group. During the performances, he dons a 
hand-carved wooden masks of a walrus and the raven and breaks into urgent, 
confident dances. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he asked me, 'How am I going to dance? I can't dance,' " Tiulana 
said. "But he never resisted. He learned and he graduated into the Eskimo 
world."

MAHONY ASKS REVIEW OF ABORTION FOES' SENTENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has asked prosecutors and 
the courts to review what he believes are "unusually harsh" sentences imposed 
on abortion foes convicted of trespassing in protests outside women's clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In letters mailed earlier this week to Los Angeles Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Reiner, City Atty. James K. Hahn, the presiding judge of the Superior 
Court, Richard Byrne, and the presiding Municipal Court judge, Jon Mayeda, 
Mahony asked that they gather the arrest and sentencing records of 
demonstrators convicted of trespassing and other misdemeanor offenses during 
clinic protests in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
"By analyzing this data, you and I will be able to compare the arrest records 
and sentences imposed in connection with pro-life activities to arrest records 
and sentences imposed in other cases," the archbishop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was not available for comment, and there was no immediate response from 
the two judges. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hahn, whose office prosecutes misdemeanor cases, denied that 
anti-abortion demonstrators are being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"They are being treated the same as any comparable type offender in 
demonstration cases," spokesman Mike Qualls said.

EPISCOPAL DIOCESE WON'T TAKE ACTION AGAINST PRIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Episcopal Diocese of Newark, N.J., plans to take no action against a 
controversial gay priest who says he will perform "gay marriages" even though 
his bishop has ordered him not to function as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert Williams of Jersey City, who gained nationwide attention early 
this year when he made widely publicized comments disparaging monogamy and 
celibacy, announced that he would be available to perform "blessing ceremonies 
for same-sex couples." 
</P>
<P>
Archdeacon Leslie Smith, spokesman for the Diocese of Newark, said Tuesday that 
the diocese would not respond to Williams' announcement -- continuing a policy 
the diocese has taken ever since Williams was forced to resign his position as 
director of The Oasis, a diocesan ministry to homosexuals based in Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Williams' announcement was "non-news" and called his actions "just a 
continuation of a pattern Robert has been in since February of this year." 
</P>
<P>
Because neither the Episcopal Church nor the state recognizes the blessing of 
same-sex couples as a legal marriage, there is some question as to whether 
Williams is fulfilling a priestly function in performing such ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if a policy of ignoring Williams' actions could lead to a breakdown of 
ecclesiastical authority, Smith said, "I am not worried about that. We don't 
have a problem with authority in this diocese. . . . It is not a diocese that 
is awash with disobedience or uncooperative priests." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Williams said he was making himself available to bless 
same-sex unions because The Oasis has decided not to bless gay unions as a 
result of pressure from church conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important ministry that many gay and lesbian couples want and 
need," Williams' statement says. "Since the most liberal diocese of the most 
liberal mainstream Christian denomination has refused to respond (to) this 
need, I want it to be known that I, as an individual Christian priest, will 
continue to respond as I have been all along." 
</P>
<P>
Smith disagreed that The Oasis has decided against same-sex union ceremonies. 
He said the The Oasis is exploring the possibility "very carefully" with a view 
to setting up appropriate guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop John Spong ordained Williams in a highly publicized ceremony in December 
-- despite a resolution by the church's General Convention that calls 
ordination of practicing homosexuals "inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Angered by Spong's actions, laity, clergy and bishops have called for 
disciplining the Newark prelate. The House of Bishops is expected to address at 
least some of those calls when it meets Sept. 15-20 in Washington.

BEATING OF O.C. GIRL COMPARED TO BENSONHURST 
</P>

<P>
Outraged over the Aug. 6 attack on a Garden Grove cheerleader that they believe 
was racially motivated, black activists Friday condemned the handling of the 
case by local auhorities and warned that it could become a "Bensonhurst West." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Amber Jefferson, who is black, should have been at her first 
cheerleading performance Friday. Instead, with her jaw wired shut and the side 
of her face stitched together, she sat silently in a Yorba Linda church, 
surrounded by black activists and the growing racial storm that her attack has 
ignited. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the criticism premature, authorities on Friday repeated pledges to 
fully explore allegations that the girl was badly beaten by several whites 
wielding bats and shouting racial slurs. But the black activists nonetheless 
promised candlelight vigils, church meetings and a possible appeal to the state 
for an independent investigation in coming weeks to vent their frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff's handling of this case is tantamount to tolerating racial 
violence, which could very well lead to even worse incidents," said Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference of Greater Los Angeles at a press conference at Friendship Baptist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California does not need, nor should it invite, a situation that 
would be branded nothing less than 'Bensonhurst West,' " Ridley-Thomas said, 
flanked by local and state officials from the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union 
and other groups involved in black civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood, became a symbol of racial violence last 
year after a black teen-ager, shopping for a used car, was attacked and killed 
there by a white gang. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County case, the racial elements in the attack are still in 
dispute, with criminal charges recommended but not yet filed against anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that (the critics) would prejudge this case," Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi said Friday. "What happened to Amber is obviously tragic, 
but it's our responsibility to deal with it in a professional manner, not an 
emotional one, and this case has got our attention at our highest levels." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Dennis LaDucer said of the critics: "We would hope that as 
the facts of this case become known in the appropriate setting -- the courtroom 
-- they will develop confidence in the intensity and thoroughness of our 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
What is known so far is that Amber was badly beaten and slashed with a piece of 
broken glass outside a Stanton apartment complex during a midnight brawl that 
involved more than a dozen people -- on one side, mostly white teen-agers and a 
42-year-old man; on the other, Amber and several black, white and Latino 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Some among the white group under investigation maintain that the fight was not 
about race but was prompted by a jilted girl. Amber, by all accounts, was not 
involved in the argument that triggered the fight. But somehow, in the end, she 
was slashed with a piece of glass that left a deep gash on the side of her 
face, and her jaw was broken, allegedly by a bat-wielding participant. 
</P>
<P>
One 19-year-old woman at the center of the dispute acknowledged in an interview 
this week that she shouted "nigger" in the midst of the fighting. But she said 
her words were directed not at Jefferson, whose father is black and mother is 
white, but at a white teen-ager whom she considered "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Wimberly of Stanton, a 42-year-old construction worker whose role in the 
attack is under investigation, watched television news reports of the 
coalition's press conference and declared afterward, "Those people lie." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's right," he said. "Why are they pushing this so far to 
make it a racial thing?" 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department said initially that it was not 
investigating the incident as a racial attack. 
</P>
<P>
But under intense criticism from local activists, the department on Tuesday 
recommended to the district attorney's office that it use a three-year old 
state "hate-crime" law, for racially motivated attacks, against three of 
Amber's alleged assailants. It also recommended a host of other assault and 
criminal charges against up to a dozen participants on both sides of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
But the activists, responding specifically to the Sheriff's Department's 
recommendations, said they were not satisfied. At the press conference, they 
questioned why some "victims" among Jefferson's group are under investigation, 
and charged that authorities have effectively set up a "smoke screen" because 
of the victim's race. Several also said they feared that the district 
attorney's office would "dump" the case on a grand jury in order to further 
stall prosecution, a prospect that Capizzi would not discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"What I can't understand is how a 15-year-old girl could have her face slashed 
so bad by someone so vicious," Amber's father, William, said as he fought back 
tears. "If this is not a crime or an attack on a minority race, why did she 
have to get hurt so bad?" 
</P>
<P>
The father also suggested that if the victim in the attack had been white and 
her attackers black, "someone would be in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Declared Jose DeSosa, state president of the NAACP: "Racial hatred was there." 
</P>
<P>
Press conference organizers declined a request from among the more than two 
dozen media representatives to talk with Amber, who leaned occasionally on her 
mother for support as she watched the speakers in silence. 
</P>
<P>
Even with surgery, it could be months before Amber returns to school and years 
before she regains full movement on the left side of her face, her family says. 
For now, said her mother, Cody Donnelly, she takes food through a straw and 
tries to cope with the emotional trauma of an attack that she does not fully 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
"The nightmares are the worst," her mother said Friday. "But we hope what these 
people were doing for us today will do some good."

It was shortly after 3 a.m. on Aug. 21 and Touny, a friend and two men he 
described as Bedouin "guides" were driving northwest through the desert, bound 
for the safety of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped us," Touny said, referring to a unit of Iraqi soldiers. "They 
almost killed us. They surrounded us with machine guns. They were checking for 
Americans and Kuwaitis. I told them (in Arabic), 'I'm a bookkeeper, I'm a 
clerk.' I told them I was Egyptian." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more harrowing minutes, the Iraqis relented -- and Touny was headed 
toward becoming one of only a few Americans in Kuwait to escape the grip of 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of me," Touny said Friday during an interview in his 
temporary Newport Beach apartment. 
</P>
<P>
His race to freedom almost ended at another point when one of the Bedouins fell 
asleep at the wheel, and the group's Chevrolet sedan careened off the road, 
sideswiping a fence. Touny said the two right-hand doors were crushed, but no 
one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
At about 10 that same morning -- aided by goodwill cigarettes he passed to 
Jordanian border guards and the savvy and cachet of the Bedouins, whom Touny 
said he paid a $750 fee -- the group at last made it into Jordan's capital, 
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next week, he obtained a new U.S. passport and flew to Cairo, where he 
was debriefed by a military attache to the U.S. embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
Touny said the Bedouins who are spiriting Westerners out of Kuwait are the new 
entrepreneurs of the Mideast, "taking advantage of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Touny said, his $750 was well spent: "I felt I wanted to get the hell 
out of there at any cost. . . . There were a lot of other people I know who 
tried to cross, and none of them made it." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the first minutes of Friday morning, Touny was reunited at Los 
Angeles International Airport with his wife, 13-year-old daughter and 
18-year-old son. The family owns a home in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, Touny recounted his odyssey to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Touny, 46, provided a uniquely informed perspective on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
An Egyptian by birth but a U.S. citizen since 1974, Touny earned his master's 
degree at New York University and for the last three years has been the chief 
manager of operations for the Bank of Kuwait and the Bank of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Touny said he has personally supervised the accounts of members of the Kuwaiti 
royal family. The palace of the emir of Kuwait, he said, was on grounds 
directly behind the rented villa where Touny lived. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his relationship with members of the royal family, Touny said, he 
thinks the Kuwaitis would be willing to pay Hussein "whatever money he wants" 
to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Touny's brush as a captive was tinged with no small amount of irony. The Touny 
family had been spending the summer in Newport Beach, as they try to do every 
year, when he returned by himself to the tiny Middle Eastern nation Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I was exhausted," Touny recalled. "I had not slept for about 24 hours. So, 
when I got to my villa (at about 2 a.m.), I went to bed." 
</P>
<P>
But two hours later, the phone rang. It was his wife, Abla, watching TV half 
the world away in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me there was a war," Touny said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
By daybreak, Touny had no doubt. He could hear explosions and see flashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran to the ATM machines (at the bank), and they were closed," Touny said, 
adding that he had flown to Kuwait the night before with the equivalent of just 
$36 U.S. dollars in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
After borrowing money from friends, Touny said, he was part of a surge of 
immediate panic buying. He said he stood in line two hours that first day to 
buy canned goods, rice, bread, powdered milk and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the proximity of the emir's palace, Iraqi troops were quickly a 
presence in his neighborhood, looting homes and controlling access in and out 
at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of Iraqi actions in my neighborhood," he said. "I tried to be 
low-key and stay out of their sight." 
</P>
<P>
About a week later, when he and friends tried to escape by car to Saudi Arabia, 
Iraqi troops stopped and ordered them back to Kuwait city. By that point, he 
had long since lost phone contact with the United States and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept calling the State Department every single day," said Abla Touny, a 
chemist who had hoped to return to her job at Kuwait University. "I was really 
going crazy. I mean, it was just a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tony Touny said he and other Americans kept in daily contact with 
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, whose officials warned them not to try another 
escape through Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the time he fled Kuwait, Touny said, he saw the results of car bombings 
and other anti-Iraqi, guerrilla-type activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of Kuwaiti resistance, even right before I left," Touny said. 
</P>
<P>
From his perspective, Touny said, Hussein's motive for invading and occupying 
Kuwait is "simple": Iraq is "a bankrupt country. They're looking for someone to 
bail them out. They want the money. And they want access to the (Persian) 
Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
By Friday afternoon, Touny was still trying to put his life back in order. With 
all of his identification behind in Kuwait -- he could not risk being 
identified as an American during his escape -- Touny headed to the Department 
of Motor Vehicles. Then it was off to a shopping mall, because the only clothes 
he brought home were those he wore. 
</P>
<P>
And, with summer almost over, Touny, his wife and children were moving back to 
their permanent residence in San Bernardino County, from where Tony Touny said 
he would seek a safe, stateside job. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't risk my life any more," he said. "I'm glad it's over. I just pray and 
hope everybody else gets out OK."

A Korean Air Boeing 747 cargo plane this week became the first foreign air 
carrier to land at the Marine Corps Air Station here to take on supplies 
destined for the Persian Gulf, a base spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Gene Brown said, however, that the KAL flight was not the first 
foreign-based airline to be used in the Mideast crisis by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi airliners have been used at other U.S. military airfields, under 
contract to the Military Airlift Command. 
</P>
<P>
Korean Air's role in ferrying supplies was disclosed Friday in Seoul by the 
Korea Times, although Korean government officials had declined to confirm the 
report.

CYPRESS POLICE REGRETFULLY 'FIRE' CANINE OFFICER

Saying that he was "just a little soft for police work," officials have 
reluctantly booted Sam the police dog from the force. 
</P>
<P>
When Sam joined the Cypress Police Department three years ago, he showed great 
promise. He seemed like a natural, scoring well above average on his 
performance tests and easily making friends with fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
But it became apparent to his superiors that Sam didn't have enough bite behind 
his bark. In fact, he was too friendly. 
</P>
<P>
So this month, the 6-year-old Belgian Malinois was fired after less than three 
years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't feel good about giving Sam up," said Lt. Jim Weuve, coordinator of 
the department's canine program. "But he did not consistently perform to the 
standard that we require." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the confidentiality of personnel files, police officials declined to 
provide details concerning Sam's early retirement. However, a staff report to 
the City Council said Sam was not able to translate what he learned in canine 
training to street situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough," said Officer Danny Forniss, Sam's handler and former partner. "It 
is hard to turn your back on someone who has been loyal." But one thing he did 
do on a regular basis was win the hearts of people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great when he had to go to (elementary) schools. He was definitively a 
people dog," Forniss said. "Maybe just a little soft for police work." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week agreed to purchase another dog to replace Sam. 
Forniss is now training with his new partner, Brutus, who, like Sam, is a 
Belgian Malinois. The cost of training the dog and officer is more than $4,000. 
However, a trade-in allowance of $2,000 was given for Sam. 
</P>
<P>
Forniss said they are going to do everything possible to make sure that the new 
dog is better suited for police work. The Police Department has had three dogs 
since starting its canine unit, and the average length of duty is five to seven 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Sam, he was returned to the kennel and quickly purchased by another 
police officer. Forniss said he would have liked to kept Sam, but was unable to 
because it might create competition between him and his new partner.

The Orange International Street Fair opened Friday night with an 
around-the-world cultural repertoire -- from belly dancing to bluegrass -- that 
attracted more than 70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 groups are sponsoring food stands at the 18th annual street fair, 
which runs through Sunday night in downtown Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The cuisine includes German, Turkish, Italian, Irish, Mexican, Japanese, Greek 
and other international fare. 
</P>
<P>
The fair's eight stages are featuring bands playing all varieties of ethnic 
music, including mariachi bands, jazz, oompah bands and Greek music. 
</P>
<P>
Artisans at 80 stands are selling handmade items. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 70,000 people there now, and they're still pouring in like the 
flood," Orange Police Sgt. Jim Anderson said at 7 p.m. Friday. "It's a good 
time, and it's just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Fair hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters who attend can be photographed with members of the Orange Fire 
Department at Children's Village in Plaza Circle, and Police Department 
officials will take children's fingerprints free of charge. MARLA CONE

SKATERS FOR CHRIST ROLL OUT RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have pasts as varied as their hairstyles. Former beatniks in black and 
Rastafarians in tie-dye, these skateboarders have arms layered with tattoos, 
scratched and bruised from skidding across concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at the end of the night, they gather in a circle and bow their heads in 
prayer to give thanks to the Lord -- for the skateboard ramps, for their safety 
and for being Christians. 
</P>
<P>
They're the Skaters for Christ. Not your typical bunch of curb-riding 
skateboard rats, these former troubled youths in Anaheim have found Jesus, and 
they're spreading the word. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people go, 'Oh, they're a bunch of hippies and ex-convicts and drug 
addicts," said Lloyd Chase, 20, a member of Skaters for Christ. "And that's the 
thing with a lot of churches and a lot of Christian people, they put a big, big 
emphasis on personal appearance. You know, it's not what's outside you, it's 
what's inside you." 
</P>
<P>
The group is sponsored by the Set Free Christian Fellowship in Anaheim, an 
independent, nondenominational church known for Christ's Sons, the 
Harley-riding Christian motorcyclists. 
</P>
<P>
The skating group numbers near 60, mostly young men and boys. They skateboard 
from house to house, knocking on doors, spreading the word. They care for the 
needy -- the poor, the sick, the aged and the shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
One resident the boys have helped is Carl Anderson, 62, of Anaheim. Neck 
injuries left him unable to work on his 75-year-old redwood-frame home, so he 
asked the skaters to help him scrape off layers of paint so he could repaint. 
</P>
<P>
"You know where these people come from," he said, "they're recovering 
alcoholics, drug addicts. . . . I got to know a number of them, and like all 
human beings, they're some good, some bad." 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, former professional skater Mike Folmer, 28, started 
Skaters for Christ. Folmer, who became a Christian four years ago, saw a need 
for Christian skaters to have a place to skate where they would not backslide 
to their old habits. For four months, the group lugged skateboard ramps back 
and forth from the main church complex on Anaheim Boulevard to the church's 
other building next to the Civic Center. Two months ago, they leased the 
property at the second site. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of kids who have been saved out of this," Folmer said. Twice a 
week the ramps are busy. Skaters -- clad in punk-style Skaters for Christ 
T-shirts, toting boards with Jesus decals -- wait for their turn. It's one of 
the few free skate parks in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
They dodge jabs about their Christianity and try to stay celibate. They still 
love their old punk albums but sing different lyrics now. Despite the 
challenges, they all say they prefer their lives now. 
</P>
<P>
What would they be doing, if it were not for Skaters for Christ? Alberto 
Sarabia, 25, said: "Skating. Drinking beer. Maybe in prison. Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Another skater, who gave his name only as Bobo, 24, tells his story more 
bluntly. "I smoked pot when I was 8. I smoked PCP when I was 13. Started 
slamming heroin and crack when I was 14. Got into pimping and prostitution when 
I was 17. Ended up at Folsom State Prison when I was 19. I accepted the Lord 
when I was 22." 
</P>
<P>
And still David Marshall, 20, told a different version. "I've never done drugs 
before in my life. Never smoked a cigarette. I've been drunk four times. . . . 
But I needed Jesus. I had the weird thoughts, couldn't get to sleep -- suicide 
-- stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Between rounds of backside grinds, frontside "nosebones," a few no-hands 
"ollies" (aerial moves) and other maneuvers on the mini-spiral ramp, the 
"bros," as they call each other, give high-fives, talk about skater gear and 
praise the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
"We call this place the church that nobody wanted, for people nobody likes," 
said Matt Fountain, 19, who lives in one of the church's homes for people who 
have recently gone through drug and alcohol detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm smiling more in the five months I've been here. . . . This is the highest 
I've ever been. The best trip I ever had was Jesus. Take some doses of Jesus, 
forget the LSD." LISA MASCARO

POLICE GET $15,000 FOR COMPUTERIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new computerized office management program will allow city police to spend 
many more hours in the field each year instead of staying at the station to 
fill out paper work. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the police, the City Council approved a plan this week to 
install a $15,000 computer networking project by 1992, one year ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Report writing now takes each officer up to two hours a day. Police hope to cut 
that time in half with the new program, Capt. John Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
Reports will be entered into computers, making revisions and filing easier. "We 
want to get as close to paperless as possible," Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
The department's 41 computers will also be linked through a central system with 
crime databases in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The project, and a concurrent program to install computers in squad cars, will 
also be completed within 18 months, Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
The projects will cost $50,000, to be paid for with money seized in drug cases.

SCHOOLS TO BEEF UP BILINGUAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an effort to better address the needs of Latino and Asian students, the 
Ocean View School District plans to spend more money on bilingual programs and 
desegregate a school with a predominantly Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
The district is spending an additional $138,000 to increase the number of 
bilingual teachers and expand programs aimed at helping students with a limited 
knowledge of English. The extra spending boosts the district's bilingual 
education budget from $255,000 to $393,000. 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this month, the school board appointed a 42-member committee to 
devise a plan for desegregating Oak View School, which is about 75% Latino. The 
committee of parents, teachers, community representatives, administrators and 
other school officials, will propose a plan to the board in December that could 
include busing and boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
The two-pronged approach aims to ease pressure from state education agencies 
and local activists who say the district needs to do more to meet the needs of 
limited-English students. By the end of the 1989-90 school year, Ocean View was 
the only district in Orange County that had not satisfied state requirements to 
recruit and train more bilingual teachers. The district has since devised a 
plan that complies with state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, which last year had only nine instructors qualified to teach more 
than 1,100 limited-English students, has doubled its bilingual teaching staff 
for 1990-91, Assistant Supt. Joseph Condon said. In November, four more 
teachers will attempt to become certified. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the additional spending will be used to add five 
bilingual teacher's aides to classrooms. The rest of the new money will be used 
to expand bilingual programs, buy about $20,000 in materials for 
limited-English speaking students, and train more bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly appointed Oak View Integration Advisory Committee will 
begin meeting this month to study the racial imbalance among the school's 
student population. At the beginning of last school year, Oak View Elementary, 
near Beach Boulevard and Slater Avenue, had 618 students. The population was 
70% Latino, 14% Asian, 14% white and 2% black, according to district figures.

CONSTRUCTION: COUNTY TAKES POSSESSION AFTER CONTRACTOR GETS SYSTEM OF FIRE

More than five months late and millions of dollars over budget, the new 
$62-million Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne Airport finally passed a 
series of fire control tests Friday, allowing an embattled airport contractor 
to turn the cavernous structure over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
As more than two years of problem-plagued construction ended Friday, airport 
officials jubilantly prepared for next week's series of celebratory galas, 
including an open house on Sept. 8 and first use by the airlines on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"We're worn out but yes, we're very happy," said Assistant Airport Manager Jan 
Mittermeier. 
</P>
<P>
Added Airport Manager George Rebella: "We are extremely pleased. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, for whom the terminal is named, had predicted early 
Friday the building would pass muster by the end of the day, after weeks of 
agonizing glitches in the building's computer-controlled fire suppression 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," Riley said. "Everywhere I go, other people tell me they 
think it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier said Friday's test results mean that airport contractor Taylor 
Woodrow California Construction Ltd. has met its contract requirements for 
"substantial completion," even though minor cleanup work remains. She said the 
county's Environmental Management Agency won't issue a much-needed certificate 
of occupancy for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been testing the complex life safety and operational systems for the 
past few weeks in the terminal," said William Ostfeld, Taylor Woodrow's senior 
vice president. "We've had to make some modifications and will continue to work 
with the county on all final issues. But we are very proud of the work that we 
have accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors awarded the terminal contract to Taylor Woodrow in 
July, 1988. The firm's low bid came in more than $17 million over the $42.5 
million originally budgeted by the county. A cost-cutting frenzy ensued, 
reducing steel tonnage, marble, skylights and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the county and Taylor Woodrow were tense at best. Forced to 
postpone the original April 1 opening day and citing missed construction 
milestones, the Board of Supervisors fired Taylor Woodrow from a $25-million 
contract to build a garage and elevated roadway.

OFFICER KILLS PIT BULL AFTER ATTACKS ON PETS;

<P>
A Newport Beach police officer shot and killed a pit bull Thursday night after 
the dog killed a neighborhood cat, attacked another pet and then tried to come 
after the officer, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the dog broke through the fence at the residence where he was being 
kept while his owner was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
About 6:45 p.m., a resident of the 1200 block of Devon Lane called police to 
report that a loose pit bull had attacked and killed his 14-year-old cat, 
police department spokesman Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the officer realizes that this is a very violent animal," Gonis 
said. He added that an animal control officer was called to the scene as well. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was trying to contain the dog in one of the yards when it attacked 
another pet. 
</P>
<P>
"Two people were walking on the public sidewalk, walking with a smaller 
Airedale terrier," Gonis said. "Then the pit bull bolts across the street and 
starts attacking the terrier." 
</P>
<P>
To break up the dog fight, the officer hit the dog on its head with his baton, 
momentarily stunning the animal. 
</P>
<P>
But as the officer backed away, the dog came toward him, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
With about 2 feet between him and the dog, the officer fired two rounds at the 
animal, fatally wounding the dog with the second shot, he said. The terrier 
survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in the incident, and there were no injuries to the 
people involved. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said the owner of the pit bull, a Costa Mesa resident, was out of town at 
the time of the incident.

BEAR BRAND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS MAY FIGHT COMMERCIAL CENTER

Residents in the Bear Brand community will probably appeal the Planning 
Commission's approval of plans for a 17-acre commercial center there, a 
community spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which calls for restaurants, office buildings and a six-screen 
theater on the northeast corner of Camino del Avion and Street of the Golden 
Lantern, was approved by the Planning Commission earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote was cast only after 34 conditions were attached to the project, 
senior planner Micki Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Brian Fisk and Marc Winer voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Community spokesman Paul Konapelsky said Thursday that homeowners are still 
unhappy about the project, which will block ocean views in the upscale 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Residents' main concerns revolve around the density of the center and the 
people and cars it will attract, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to generate an additional 14,060 automobile trips each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the project is the main issue, along with the types of uses within 
the project," Konapelsky said. "The biggest issue is the movie theater." 
</P>
<P>
A proposed service station has been deleted from the project and a 65-foot 
monument has been replaced with a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
The overall size of the project has been reduced by about 3,800 square feet, 
according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission has final authority to approve the plans unless they 
are successfully appealed to the City Council.

VALENCIA COACH MARRUJO UNDERPLAYS TEAM'S CHANCES, AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Marrujo leaned back in his chair and answered the question almost before 
it was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take them one game at a time," Marrujo said. 
</P>
<P>
Whoa, slow down coach. You don't want to provide any bulletin board material 
for opposing teams. Those brash statements and wild predictions can only get 
you in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine years, Marrujo has coached the Valencia High School football 
team with caution. 
</P>
<P>
Marrujo never looks too far down the road and he definitely keeps his quotes 
bland, especially when talking to reporters. It's safe to say that any comments 
from him will be something that's safe to say. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's getting harder and harder to find anyone, especially an Orange 
League coach, who believes Marrujo's soft-sell. And you can't really blame 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia has won or shared the league title for seven consecutive years. The 
Tigers reached the Southern Section Division VI championship game three of the 
past four seasons and won the title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Things like that get noticed, especially by other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"You can talk all you want about who's going to win the league title, but in 
the end you always have to go with Valencia," Anaheim Coach Raul Victores said. 
</P>
<P>
Things should be no different this season. Valencia is a unanimous choice to 
again win the league title, with one abstention -- Marrujo. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some experienced players back, but we have some holes to fill too," 
Marrujo said. "I really think the only reason we're picked to win it is 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are a few other reasons too. Like the fact that the Tigers have won 
32 of their past 35 league games or that the only league team to beat them in 
the past seven years is Western. 
</P>
<P>
Even Western Coach Jim Howell says no one -- not even the Pioneers -- will beat 
Valencia this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us will be playing for second place," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Marrujo has spent nine years refining his program, one that is all substance 
and no flash. The Tigers are always well-drilled, consistent and conservative, 
much like their coach. 
</P>
<P>
No player is greater than the team. If anyone thinks so, he doesn't play for 
Marrujo. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other schools, Valencia awards helmet decals for great plays. 
However, decals are doled out only if the team wins. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are the occasional stars. During his three years at Valencia, 
running back Ray Pallares gained 5,396 yards, which was a state record until 
Russell White broke it in 1988. Dorian Estes and Keef Leasure also excelled as 
Tiger running backs. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, the Valencia players are the blue-collar variety. They go quietly 
about their business and their business is winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of good kids here," Marrujo said. "I think that's one reason 
we've been able to sustain the program." 
</P>
<P>
The players mirror their coach, talking in generalities and cliches, always 
careful not to offend. Their practices are workmanlike, almost serene. No chest 
pounding or finger pointing. 
</P>
<P>
Marrujo doesn't even like it when the Tiger fans become too boisterous. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Valencia was leading Western, 15-7, with less than two minutes 
left. The Pioneers had the ball inside their 10-yard line and had no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Valencia crowd began chanting, "Na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodby." Marrujo 
turned to an assistant coach and said., "Great, that's just what we need. Now 
they'll drive 90 yards and tie the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: Just win, baby . . . anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
However, success brings attention and few schools were more successful in the 
'80s. In fact, Valencia won more league championships than any other Orange 
County team during the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"They are always a well-coached team," Savanna Coach Fred DiPalma said. "Mike 
does a really good job at keeping the kids' minds on the game. And once you get 
a winning tradition, you get more kids out for the team and the winning becomes 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
Before Marrujo was hired in 1981, Valencia had little winning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Tigers finished third in the Orange League and qualified for the 
playoffs. However, before that season they had lost 30 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, they were happy with just being a third-place team and getting 
into the playoffs," Marrujo said. 
</P>
<P>
Marrujo has experience with reviving programs. In 1977, he was hired at Pius X, 
which had been the doormat of the tough Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
In the four years under Marrujo, the Warriors were 21-17-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That may not sound like much, but remember that was the Angelus League," 
Marrujo said. "We had to play teams like St. Paul, Bishop Amat, Mater Dei and 
Servite." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia qualified for the playoffs the first two seasons under Marrujo and, in 
1983, the Tigers won their first league title. No one has been able to unseat 
them since. 
</P>
<P>
"They got it rolling over there," Howell said. "Mike has developed the lower 
programs and the kids develop. By the time they get to the varsity, they are 
ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Whether this 1990 Valencia team is ready to go is open for debate, at least by 
Marrujo. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be lucky to win two games," Marrujo said. Then he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
At times, even he has trouble buying that Mike Marrujo soft-sell.

<P>
Coach: Raul Victores (second year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 4-6, 2-3 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 25 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Six offense, seven defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Chad Campbell, QB, 6-3, 178, Sr.; Carlos Flores, LB, 6-0, 215, 
Sr.; Say Iemsisanith, RB/LB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Robert Jones, RB, 5-9, 200, Sr.; 
Ismael Lopez, DG, 5-10, 215, Sr.; James Parson DT, 6-3, 220, Sr.; Robert Serna, 
OG, 5-9, 180, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Giulian Buzila, DB/WR, 5-11, 170, So.; Phil Covarruvias, QB, 
5-10, 147; Brian Diaz, RB/DB 5-8, 175, So. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Colonists will be strong on the defensive front, where they return 
two linemen and two linebackers. Lopez was a first-team all-league selection 
last season. Jones could be a quality runner. He gained more than 400 yards 
last season, splitting time at running back and quarterback. Jones will play 
only running back this season, which was his position as a sophomore and 
freshman. Campbell and Covarruvias will compete at quarterback, but neither has 
much experience. The offensive line has good size, but lacks experience. Serna 
is the only returning starter. The Colonists have good depth with 65 players on 
the roster, 35 of who are seniors.

Parrack, DT, 6-4, 225, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Wildcats lost nine three-year starters from the 1989 team that 
reached the second round of the Division VI playoffs. The most glaring loss was 
quarterback Chad Marlow, who passed for more than 1,400 yards last season. The 
defense is led by Ryan and Gasporra; both were first-team all-league selections 
in 1989. Morales moves from defensive back to tailback. He'll have plenty of 
support from an offensive line that returns three starters. 
</P>
<P>

Coach: Bill Friedrich 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 1-9, 1-4 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 17 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One on offense, six on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Josh Acosta, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Ariel Courvetier, TB, 6-2, 195, 
Sr.; Don Darby, FB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Andy DiMarco, DT, 5-10, 195, Sr.; John 
Garcia, DB, 5-9, 165, Sr.; Chad Irwin, LB, 6-2, 195, Sr.; Jernique Mitchell, 
DT, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Grantt Rowan, LB, 6-3, 215, Sr.; Norm Tuazon, DB, 5-6, 145, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: J.R. Garrett, WR, 5-10, 160, Jr.; Doug Isaacs, QB, 6-0, 170, 
Jr.; A.J. McCowan, QB, 5-8, 155, Sr.; Anthony Requejo, OL, 6-2, 290, Jr.; Randy 
Sparks, OL, 6-2, 270, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Sentinels have good size on the offensive line and some experience 
on defense. However, there are many question marks at the skill positions, 
especially at quarterback where Acosta, Isaacs and McCowan are competing for 
the starting spot. Courvetier was the anchor on the Magnolia 440 relay team 
last spring. Friedrich is the team's third head coach in as many years. He was 
the head coach at Millikan High School last season and before that was the 
coach at St. John Bosco for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Fred DiPalma (second year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 0-10, 0-5 (Savanna forfeited six victories and a tie because of an 
ineligible player) 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 18 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four on offense, four on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Brook Bell, LB/RB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Vince Flores, WR/DB, 6-1, 
165, Sr.; Marty Garcia, OT, 6-2, 275; Leon Landry RB/DB, 6-1, 170, Sr.; Joe 
Nava, OL/DL, 210, Sr.; Hien Nguyen, DB/WR, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Hoan Nguyen, DB/WR, 
6-2, 170. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Brad Belanger, QB/DB, 5-7, 150, Jr.; Glenn Grabhorn, OL/DL, 5-9, 
175, Sr.; Hieu Nguyen, RB/DB, 5-7, 155, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Rebels were league co-champions with Valencia last season, but had 
to forfeit the title because of an ineligible player. "I think the kids have 
been very positive about what happened," DiPalma said. "And they are very 
determined." Whether that will mean continued success depends on how well the 
Rebels fill the holes. Landry, a starting defensive back last season, has the 
toughest assignment as he moves to running back to replace Kenison PoChing (900 
yards). The secondary is sound with Hien and Hoan Nguyen, who are brothers, and 
Hieu Nguyen, who is not related. 
</P>
<P>
Western 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Howell (12th year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 8-3, 4-1 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 19 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three on offense, one on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Gil Brito, QB, 5-10, 185, Sr.; Francel Esquivel, C/LB, 5-7, 175, 
Sr.; Shane Foss, FB, 5-10, 185, Sr.; Mike Hikes, LB, 5-11, 175, Sr.; Jesse 
McReynolds, OT, 6-2, 210, Sr.; Al Quinto, LB, 5-10, 190, Sr.; John Roady, OT, 
6-4, 230, Sr.; Derrick Taylor, TE/DE, 6-1, 200, Sr.; Jason Vaughn, TE, 5-11, 
170, Sr.; Alfredo Villages, LB/WB, 5-6, 160, Jr.; John Walder, RB/DB, 5-7, 145, 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jeff Bates, OG, 5-10, 190, So.; Jason Christensen, WR/DB, 5-10, 
150, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Pioneers always have a big offensive line, but this season their 
strength should be at the skill positions. Brito has been a starter since his 
sophomore season and is dangerous on the field because of his quickness. He 
passed for more than 1,000 yards and rushed for more than 500 yards in 1989. 
Foss was a first-team all-league selection last season. The offensive line is 
much smaller than in previous seasons, but Roady and McReynolds give it 
experience. The Pioneers also have a good corps of linebackers, but overall, 
they lack experience on the defensive side. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Marrujo (10th season) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 10-1, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 23 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four on offense, three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Kevin Alexander, DB/WR, 5-9, 160, Jr.; Korey Alexander, DB/WR, 
5-9, 160, Jr.; Sorin Cabuta, DT/OT, 6-1, 215, Sr.; Mike Ehli, LB, 6-1, 195; 
John Fewell, RB/DE, 5-10, 175, Sr. Dave Fenstermaker, C, 5-10, 180, Sr.; Ken 
Lee, LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Mark O'Brien, 6-2, 185, Jr., Jr.; Ryan Roskelly, 5-10, 
170, Jr.; Dave Wallace, DT, 5-11, 208, Sr.; Josiah Williams, WR, 6-0, 165, Sr.; 
Scott Williams, DT/G, 6-1, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Raul Padilla, DE/RB, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Tigers are favored to win the league championship. Although they 
have only seven starters returning, they are an experienced squad. Most of this 
year's starters played last season. As always, the running game will be strong. 
Roskelly gained 750 yards rushing last season and Fewell gained 513. The 
defense is led by Ehli, who has been a starter since the 1988 playoffs. O'Brien 
will be the first junior to start at quarterback for Valencia since Ron Kreiger 
in 1982. O'Brien played little last season, but has a strong arm, according to 
Marrujo.

<P>
Lara Carlsen of Corona del Mar High School has made an oral commitment to play 
volleyball next year at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsen, a 6-foot middle blocker, chose USC over UCLA, Hawaii and the 
University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
She was an all-Southern Section selection last year and helped the Sea Kings 
reach the finals of the state tournament. Carlsen is the top returning player 
for the Sea Kings, ranked second in Volleyball Monthly's preseason national 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Edison boys' volleyball Coach Brian Rofer, who guided the Chargers to the 
Southern Section 4-A final this past spring, has resigned to accept an 
assistant coaching job at UCLA, his alma mater. Edison officials are seeking a 
replacement. MIKE REILLEY

ALTHOUGH BIG FAVORITES, TITANS WON'T LOOK PAST SONOMA STATE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: AFTER A SCARE FROM DIVISION II CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE LAST YEAR, THE 
FULLERTON CAN'T AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT IN OPENER. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not often the Cal State Fullerton football team gets the role of heavy 
favorite, the big bully whipping a helpless foe. 
</P>
<P>
But in Sonoma State, the Titans' opponent for the season opener at 1 p.m. today 
in Santa Ana Stadium, the Titans will face an even lower life form in college 
football's food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Think the Division I Titans, who allocate the equivalent of 60 scholarships, 35 
fewer than the maximum allowed by the NCAA, have it rough? The Division II 
Cossacks don't give any football scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Think the Big West Conference doesn't get any respect? Can you name another 
team besides Sonoma State and UC Davis in the Northern California Athletic 
Conference? 
</P>
<P>
Just listen to Cossacks Coach Tim Walsh, assessing his chances today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything we can to compete with them," he said. "We just want to 
play hard and make a good showing." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like Cal State Fullerton's motto when the Titans play the Auburns and 
Louisiana States of the world. But for one rare day, Fullerton Coach Gene 
Murphy gets to preach to his players the perils of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them don't ever look down your nose at anyone," Murphy said. "People 
say we should walk all over Sonoma State. Don't talk to me like that -- never. 
We should win, but I don't have any idea what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has vivid memories of the last time Fullerton played a Division II team 
it was supposed to defeat easily. The Titans needed a second-half comeback, in 
which they scored 20 consecutive points, to defeat Cal State Northridge, 27-20, 
in the second game of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky to win that game," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy wouldn't tab his team a huge favorite today. Not when he'll be relying 
on so many inexperienced players, many of whom will be making their first 
starts for a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton returned only two offensive starters and four defensive starters from 
last season's team, and all of Murphy's offensive skilled-position players, 
with the exception of receiver J.J. Celestine, are new. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma State also is inexperienced, with only six returning starters from 1989. 
The Cossacks will start a freshman quarterback, Les Vanderpool, and five of six 
offensive linemen are new. However, Sonoma State's center, two guards and two 
tackles average 269 pounds per man. 
</P>
<P>
The Cossacks have a solid running game with Glenn Campbell, former Saddleback 
High and Rancho Santiago College standout, and Shelton Trosclair, who combined 
for 1,050 yards and 10 touchdowns last season. Walsh says both could play in 
the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Four other former Orange County community college players, linebackers Lenny 
Wagner (Fullerton) and James Solley (Golden West), safety Kurt Szuba (Golden 
West) and offensive guard Todd Little (Golden West), will start for Sonoma 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a homecoming for them, and I know they're excited about playing in 
Orange County," Walsh said. "We just want to compete with Fullerton, but the 
players really want to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans and Cossacks are also similar in that two of their best players are 
kickers. Fullerton's Phil Nevin made 15 of 21 field-goal attempts with a long 
of 54 yards, and Sonoma State's Ed Beaulac, formerly of Long Beach City 
College, kicked a 60-yard field goal against St. Mary's in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have a legitimate chance to get drafted," Walsh said. "If he's feeling 
good, he may try a 65-yarder in a game."

<P>
Gradco Systems Inc., a maker of copier and printer products, postponed its 
annual shareholders meeting Friday and said it will fight an attempt by a tiny 
New York publisher to seek representation on Gradco's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Plenum Publishing Corp., which owns 8.9% of Gradco, said in a 
filing last week that it plans to nominate at least one outside director to 
Gradco's board. The company currently has no outside directors. 
</P>
<P>
It was also disclosed Friday that Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash filed a civil 
lawsuit on Aug. 24 against Keith B. Stewart, Gradco's chairman, and the 
company's directors for allegedly granting themselves warrants to buy a 17% 
stake in the company's valuable new Japanese subsidiary at below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We will solicit proxies to replace the board of directors of Gradco," said 
Bernard Bressler, Plenum's corporate counsel and secretary. He said, however, 
that the New York firm has no plans to acquire a controlling interest in 
Gradco. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said it would seek to nominate its own outside director at the annual 
meeting, which was abruptly rescheduled for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, Plenum alleges 
that Stewart and company directors conspired to misappropriate for their own 
benefit one of the company's most valuable assets -- its Japanese subsidiary, 
worth an estimated $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Stewart, the suits names Gradco officers Joseph Sanchez, president and 
chief operating officer, and Mark M. Takeuchi, president and chief executive of 
Gradco Japan. It also names two company directors, Thomas J. O'Keefe and Horst 
O. Sieben. 
</P>
<P>
A Gradco spokesman declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the scheme arose from Gradco's reorganization this spring 
in which it divided itself into two operating subsidiaries, Gradco Printer 
Systems Inc., a money-losing printer-products unit, and Gradco Japan Ltd., 
which consisted of the company's lucrative copier-products sales owned almost 
wholly by the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the restructuring, Gradco discontinued manufacturing in Santa Ana 
and shifted its production to Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the board approved a plan in April to give top officers 
warrants -- or stock-purchase rights -- to buy 2.5 million shares, or 17%, of 
Gradco Japan, for $4.6 million, or $1.86 per share. That "inordinately low" 
price contrasted with the company's sale in June of 27% of Gradco Japan for 
$26.5 million, or $6.70 a share, to a group of Japanese investors led by Japan 
Associated Finance Co. Ltd., the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was given warrants to buy 64% of the 17% stake in Gradco Japan, the 
suit alleged. Gradco officers, according to the suit, stood to pocket a 
windfall of more than $12 million, including $7.7 million for Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the company engaged in a complex transaction to 
"window dress" the "misappropriation of corporate assets." The suit seeks 
unspecified damages and asks the court to bar Gradco's officers from exercising 
their warrants.

LAWSUIT CLAIMS ALLERGAN CHIEFS INFLATED STOCK; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTOR: SHAREHOLDERS FILE ON COMPANY'S BEHALF, SEEKING RETURN OF SALARIES FOR 
MISLEADING PROJECTIONS.

<P>
In an unusual lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, three Allergan 
shareholders are seeking on behalf of the company to force 11 officers and 
directors to return their salaries for alleged acts to inflate the company's 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The derivative shareholders' lawsuit was filed by Peter Stuyvesant Lt. and 
Joanne Gollomp. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders -- including a Pennsylvania corporation -- are also seeking 
unspecified damages from Irvine-based Allergan's former parent, Smith-Kline 
Beecham PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Other than legal costs, the shareholders are not asking for any money for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit -- filed Wednesday -- accuses the officers and directors of making 
inflated projections for its fiscal second quarter in 1989 and causing a 15% 
drop in the company's stock price when results were far below those forecasted. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the plaintiffs claim Allergan failed to disclose that its 
financial future depended on the timely introduction of a new retinal analyzer, 
and on a strong rate of new contact lens wearers. 
</P>
<P>
The eye-care and skin-care company was hit by a flurry of shareholder lawsuits 
last year, claiming it gave an overly optimistic portrayal of its prospects 
before being spun off by Smith-Kline as a separate publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
Those suits seek damages which would be paid out to individual shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan said it had no comment on the suit filed Wednesday.

New Home Sales Fall 5th Time This Year: New home sales in July declined for the 
fifth time in seven months, the government said Wednesday, and industry 
observers said rising mortgage rates linked to the Mideast crisis will compound 
the decline in months ahead. The Commerce Department said new homes sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 548,000 units, down from 561,000 units in 
June and 741,000 in July, 1989. For the first seven months of the year, sales 
have fallen 12.4% below the pace of 1989.

KITCHEN WHERE?; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: MORE AND MORE HOMEOWNERS ARE PUTTING THEIR KITCHENWARE, ALONG WITH 
FULLY EQUIPPED KITCHENS, IN THEIR BACK YARDS, FOR EASY CLEANUP AND STEP-SAVING. 
</P>

<P>
Tom Price always thought it would be nice to have a kitchen designed with a 
drain in the middle of the floor. That way, he could just "hose it down" 
because "sometimes cooking can be so darn messy." 
</P>
<P>
He now has a kitchen where he can do just that because his kitchen is outside. 
</P>
<P>
Price, a plumbing contractor, designed the outdoor kitchen for his North Tustin 
home so he can use it at least three times a week, usually year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The L-shaped kitchen has a barbecue with a rotisserie, a commercial griddle, 
two gas burners, a sink with a garbage disposal, plenty of counter space, 
storage areas and electrical outlets. It cost about $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when Price prepares fried chicken or tacos, cleanup is easy. He just 
closes the barbecue cover and places a custom-made cover of galvanized sheet 
metal over the grill and burners. Then he squirts a little cleaner on the 
counter, wipes it lightly and hoses everything down. 
</P>
<P>
Price isn't the only back-yard chef. 
</P>
<P>
He's just one of a growing number of people who are taking the traditional 
Southern California back-yard barbecue to a whole new level. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside barbecue units and kitchens are becoming a lot stronger," says Dale 
Waldo of D.W.L.A., a Tustin landscape architect firm. "I think once people 
understand how to barbecue and cook outside, they really use it quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
There's no set rule about what an outdoor kitchen has to include. The idea is 
to enhance a barbecue area to include whatever will make it more convenient to 
prepare and serve a meal outside. 
</P>
<P>
Some people want a counter area where guests can sit around in chairs or bar 
stools, talk with the chef and consume the results of his or her efforts. 
Others also want a refrigerator to save trips back into the house. Or maybe 
they need a sink for washing vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Earthstone Ovens in Studio City is even beginning to interest people in outdoor 
wood-fire ovens that can cook pizza, chicken, roasts and other items. The ovens 
cost about $1,000 and installation is $600 to $3,000. Most people with outdoor 
kitchens want electrical outlets so they can use hot plates, electric skillets, 
blenders or crock pots outside. 
</P>
<P>
Sam and Kathy Perricone of San Juan Capistrano told their landscape architect 
they wanted a barbecue. Originally they had something small in mind, according 
to Carl Vella, a landscape architect in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
What Vella designed was a U-shaped counter near a pool area. The counter has an 
eating area, a large barbecue, an under-the-counter refrigerator, a sink, 
electrical outlets and storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
"When we finished the preliminary designs and explained how it would function 
and the ease with which they could carry out their entertaining, why, they 
absolutely had to have it," Vella says. 
</P>
<P>
The Perricones' outdoor kitchen has two 10-foot-long counters covered in 
2-inch-square aqua-colored ceramic tile. Part of the wall of the outdoor 
kitchen is Slumpstone with a bull-nose brick cap on it. The rest is brick. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the six-acre estate that interior designer RoxAnn Johnson of 
Spatial Expressions in Orange worked on. The Los Angeles home has two pools -- 
a volleyball pool and a diving pool. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor refreshment center became part of an entertainment area that was 100 
feet away from a home. 
</P>
<P>
A barbecue, tables with chairs and patio umbrellas are on one side of the 
volleyball pool, and a sunken refreshment center is on the other side. The 
refreshment center's countertop is level with the pool and bar stools are 
inside the pool so people can swim up, take a stool and socialize with the 
chef. 
</P>
<P>
The counter has dark blue ceramic tile to match the pool tile. The refreshment 
center includes a deep stainless steel sink with lab-style faucets, storage for 
glasses and bottles, an ice maker and a small stainless steel refrigerator 
under the counter, according to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Price says he uses his outdoor kitchen so often that "we've got a fairly virgin 
(indoor) kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
His favorite element is the 30-inch-wide commercial grill. "I do a lot of 
Oriental cooking," he says. "It's really nice for making fried rice on. You get 
the grill nice and hot and fry the rice and the vegetables, the stir-fry type 
of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have a place with a couple of burners," he adds. "If you want to 
put the beans or the vegetables out here, one person can watch the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
He's also pleased with his outdoor sink, which is made out of a granite-colored 
synthetic. He had a gray cast-iron sink at first, but didn't like the water 
spots. The sink has a vegetable scrubber, a pullout German faucet and a soap 
dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
"When you bring home things like corn on the cob you won't have all that mess 
inside," he says. "You just bring it outside." 
</P>
<P>
He uses the barbecue to cook steaks, chicken, pork chops, fish and even corn 
and baked potatoes. When the light begins to fade outside, he just snaps on his 
outdoor lighting, including a 100-watt floodlight directed at the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The long part of the L is about 9 feet and contains the barbecue, the grill, 
open counter area and storage underneath. The short part of the L is about 7 
feet with a 3-foot addition for the sink. 
</P>
<P>
The walls are made of concrete block, faced with river rock to match the nearby 
retaining walls, and the counter is a rough-textured, 8-inch tile in a granite 
color. 
</P>
<P>
Price drew the plans and had a mason do most of the construction on the outdoor 
kitchen, which is near the back of the house, where there are outlets for gas, 
electricity and water. That made installation much easier. 
</P>
<P>
The stonework cost about $3,000. The counter tile was $1,000. Electrical work 
cost $300 and plumbing equipment was $400. The commercial grill and the 
barbecue each cost $500. 
</P>
<P>
Price and his wife Jill have left room for an outdoor refrigerator but the one 
inside the house and the two in the nearby garage (including a 17-case bottle 
cooler) seem to accommodate their cooling needs. 
</P>
<P>
Once dinner is prepared, the Prices carry the food to a patio table next to a 
pool edged with man-made rock. The sound of water trickling from a spa into the 
pool, a cool breeze and the soft sound of wind chimes make it an ideal place to 
unwind. 
</P>
<P>
The Perricones also enjoy being outside. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not sitting there sweltering in the house," Sam Perricone says of the 
benefits of an outdoor kitchen. "You're outside cooking. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer we use it quite a bit. I would say, minimum, three times a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
They also find the outdoor kitchen a boon to entertaining, even when they've 
hired caterers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great because they're set up out there," he says. "They don't really have 
to use the inside of the house and they pretty much have what they need." 
</P>

ARTISANS: SPOTLIGHTING MAKERS OF HAND-CRAFTED GOODS; 
</P>
<P>
BANANA FISH PRODUCTIONS: A NEW LOOK AT CUSTOM-MADE GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Banana Fish Productions is either: 
</P>
<P>
A) A Hollywood-based avant-garde film company. 
</P>
<P>
B) A trendy Newport Beach sushi restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
C) Or a Santa Ana glazing contractor specializing in decorative glass. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer, surprisingly enough, is C. Those who guessed correctly are 
excused from viewing a self-indulgent art film or eating a meal of raw octopus. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual name, taken from the title of a J.D. Salinger story, was chosen by 
partners Dan Iman and Jerry Smith when they went into business together a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to completely separate ourselves from the competition," Iman, 41, 
recalls. "Too many companies had generic names, like 'Tiffany this' or 'Stained 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And secondly," he continues, "we wanted a name that was difficult to forget. 
Many of our clients in the residential sector may only deal with us once every 
couple of years. We didn't want them to forget our name in case they lost our 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
Forgetful clients are not as critical today as they were when the company 
opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, up to 40% of the company's business was for homeowners. Now, 
only 10% is devoted to high-end residential customers, with the balance going 
to commercial enterprises such as restaurants, hotels and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
In Las Vegas, Banana Fish-designed glass can be seen in two new hotel-casinos, 
the Excalibur and the Rio. Closer to home, the company has supplied decorative 
glass to the Sauces eatery in Mission Viejo, the Good Earth in Irvine and 
numerous Baker's Square, Norm's and Denny's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the Santa Ana-based firm's most intricate design has been for the 
Island's restaurant chain. The etched glass features a jungle scene replete 
with lily pond, cockatoos, toucans and other exotic creatures. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is in the residential area that the company does some of its most 
interesting work. Interior designers and commercial contractors bring in Banana 
Fish to make custom shower enclosures. 
</P>
<P>
The process can take six weeks or longer to complete and cost anywhere between 
$2,500 and $6,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
The price is determined by the complexity of the carving or etching, the type 
of metal used for the fittings and whether bent glass is used. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the home is still in the framing stage, the partners go over the 
blueprints at the job site to ascertain special needs. For instance, if the 
shower walls are made of marble and the client doesn't want any of the hardware 
to show, grooves or slots have to be added in the marble to support the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Drawings of the etching are made, and a template, or mock-up, of the finished 
product is produced on paper, cardboard or wood. This allows the customer to 
see what the completed enclosure will look like. 
</P>
<P>
Once everyone is satisfied and the price is agreed upon, Iman contacts a custom 
metal supplier in Gardena who provides the chrome, brass or stainless steel 
fittings. A full-size template is then sent to another vendor in Pennsylvania 
that bends and laminates glass. The glass is a half-inch thick to give it a 
greater presence and enable more pronounced etchings. 
</P>
<P>
A full-size drawing, or cartoon, of the carving or etching that is to be 
reproduced on the glass is drawn. The cartoon is either approved or modified by 
the customer. 
</P>
<P>
"The client may have changed what he had in mind by the time he sees the 
full-sized cartoon," Iman says. "This is the first time he's bought a $6,000 
shower enclosure, so it's important he's satisfied with it." 
</P>
<P>
The full-size cartoon is glued in place. Then the design is hand cut using an 
X-acto knife -- the company goes through thousands of blades a week -- through 
the paper drawing. The glass is then taken to the sandblasting booth. 
</P>
<P>
There, aluminum oxide is used instead of sand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more consistent, even though it's more expensive," Iman says. "One 
hundred pounds of sand may cost $2, where the same amount of aluminum oxide 
will run $50. But the aluminum oxide is smooth and uniform in appearance, and 
the sand isn't. Aluminum oxide is made, rather than picked up." 
</P>
<P>
The glass can be cut at multiple depths, creating a desirable effect. A bird, 
for example, can have each feather sandblasted at different depths, making it 
look three dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
When the contractor is ready, the entire enclosure is installed. 
</P>
<P>
If everything was handled perfectly, the entire project would have taken about 
six weeks. After a stint in the armed services, Iman graduated from Cal State 
Long Beach with a degree in business administration. His first job after 
graduation was as an assistant controller of a company that specialized in 
restaurant and hotel interiors. He eventually became general manager of the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the vendors he used was a decorative glass company. Its owner was more 
of an artisan than a businessman, and he persuaded Iman to become his general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The two eventually had a falling out, and Iman -- together with the company's 
top artist, Jerry Smith -- formed Banana Fish Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, neither Iman nor Smith has much custom glasswork in his own home. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have a window in the kitchen, but that's it," says Iman, who lives in 
Irvine. "We're so busy, neither of us have time to do anything for ourselves. 
My little window took my artisan 40 hours to do, and I'm sure that anything 
we'd want would be even more intricate and time-consuming."

SINGLE-FAMILY HOME GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1980s the county's stock of single-family detached homes grew by 
13%. Eight cities had higher rates, led by the 93% increase in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Four cities actually have fewer of these homes now than they did at the outset 
of the '80s. And the county's total unincorporated areas, of course, also have 
far fewer as more areas have incorporated themselves into city status. Here's a 
city-by-city breakdown:
