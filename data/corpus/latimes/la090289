Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles will celebrate the 43rd annual 
Catholic observance of Labor Day in a Mass Sunday at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, 
but he will skip the annual Southern California Labor Institute breakfast 
co-sponsored by the archdiocese the next day at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The two events were separated this year in the midst of a bitter fight between 
organized labor and the archdiocese as Mahony challenged union organizing of 
workers at the church's 10 cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, in a recent statement, asserted that he wants to maintain "a close 
relationship . . . with organized labor" but added that recent breakfasts have 
put him in difficult positions. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1986 breakfast, Mahony said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) spoke "most 
favorably" for the right to abortion. "I was stunned," Mahony said. Last year's 
breakfast "could accurately be described as a 'pro-Dukakis, anti-Bush' 
political event," he said. While the archbishop said he understood that labor 
leaders support candidates with similar views, Mahony said his presence could 
have wrongly signaled that he backed particular candidates. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Mahony privately blasted the 1988 Labor Day event 
as "a travesty" and the sponsoring institute as "hostile" and "anti-Catholic" 
in a letter to Patrick W. Henning, the institute's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Labor Day Mass once was the highlight of the yearly observance, 
followed by informal coffee and doughnuts, according to a church spokesman. But 
in recent years the breakfast has attracted as many as 1,500 people while the 
Mass preceding it drew no more than 50 people. Mahony said not only labor 
leaders but also union members and their families have been invited to the 
10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass.

Not long before she died on June 26, Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, founder of the 
53-year-old Jewish Spectator magazine, turned over the editorship to Robert 
Bleiweiss and his Calabasas-based American Friends of the Center for Jewish 
Living and Values. "He is a remarkably knowledgeable trans-sectarian Jew 
totally committed to the sustenance of Jewish values for this and subsequent 
generations," wrote Weiss-Rosmarin in the recent combined Spring-Summer issue. 
The eclectic, intellectual quarterly has a national circulation of fewer than 
1,500, but its contributors include well-known figures. Deborah Lipstadt, 
professor of modern Jewish history at Occidental College, chairs the new 
editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Television Network, carried by five Los Angeles cable systems, has 
"struggled and suffered from a lack of funds" for the eight years of its 
existence, according to Jay Sanderson, executive director. But now, with newly 
developed financial support, Sanderson said, the Los Angeles-based, nonprofit 
network will launch a new format on Sept. 17. The added programs will include a 
19-part documentary from Israel Broadcasting on the founding of the Jewish 
state. JOHN DART

700 GUESTS DON'T ADD UP TO FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS PHILIPSON, Morris Philipson, director of the University of Chicago 
Press, and a novelist, wrote What's the Sense of Your Parties? a study of 
Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, for the inaugural issue of Critical Inquiry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to the seasonal warmth of late summer, a great deal of hot air has 
circulated in our atmosphere, polluting otherwise sane and sensible minds with 
the thought that the party that Malcolm Forbes threw for himself was, in fact, 
the party of the century. 
</P>
<P>
By what criteria can one justify calling a party the greatest of the 20th 
Century? By the amount of money spent to transport, entertain, lodge, feed and 
quench the thirst of the guests? By the quantity of the guests? The qualities 
of the guests? For example, can we measure the qualities of that unique 
relationship called friendship against the qualities of professional skill or 
accomplishment, political power, artistic greatness, social standing? Can, as a 
matter of "fact," anyone actually have 600 to 700 friends? 
</P>
<P>
St. Thomas Aquinas says that the chief end of true friendship is much good 
conversation. Is there any confirmation that there was more good conversation 
among friends at Malcolm Forbes' 70th birthday celebration than at any other 
party in the 20th Century? Or were they content, silently, simply to mirror 
each other's reflected glory? 
</P>
<P>
If social status were the primary criterion, certainly no party has surpassed 
the grandeur of the funeral party for England's King Edward VII in 1910. The 
monarchs of Europe -- most of whom were descendants of Queen Victoria, related 
to each other like offshoots from a genealogical spider plant -- and their 
titled lessers gathered at Buckingham Palace for what was to be the last good 
time for the Old World. The czar of Russia, the kaiser of Germany, the king of 
Spain -- so many would lose their heads or their thrones in the next decade or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate for the party that defined its age took place on May 18, 
1922, in Paris. It was meant to bring together the greatest artists of the 20th 
Century. According to George D. Painter, who wrote the biography of Marcel 
Proust, the formal supper was given by Violet and Sydney Schiff, a "wealthy, 
and highly intelligent English couple, patrons of art, literature, and music." 
To celebrate the first performance of Igor Stravinsky's "Renard," danced by 
Diaghilev's Ballet Russe, the Schiffs wished to honor "the four men of genius 
whom they most admired, Picasso (who did not show up), Stravinsky, Proust and 
James Joyce." 
</P>
<P>
Proust is known to have approached Stravinsky with the question, "Do you like 
Beethoven?" 
</P>
<P>
The most original composer of his time was suffering anxiety in anticipation of 
the first-night reviews and responded curtly, "I detest him!" 
</P>
<P>
Proust persisted. "But surely," he continued, "the late quartets?" 
</P>
<P>
"Worst things he ever wrote!" snarled Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
As for James Joyce, he arrived at midnight, "already the worse for wear, and 
improperly dressed because he did not possess a suit of tails," according to 
Painter's account. "He settled morosely down, head buried in hands, to drink 
champagne." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the evening, Proust invited the Schiffs and Joyce into his car, 
having arranged that his chauffeur drive them each home. During the ride, Joyce 
complained of his eyes. Proust complained of his stomach. Joyce opened a window 
and lit a cigarette; Sydney Schiff quickly shut the window and asked Joyce to 
put out the cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that I do not know M. Joyce's work," remarked Proust. "I have never 
read M. Proust," replied Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
Painter concluded that "the failure of writers of genius to appreciate one 
another's works is a common and unregrettable phenomenon of instinctive 
self-protection; for if one allowed himself to be seized by another's 
greatness, he would risk contaminating his own." 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, how can one have a great party at all, let alone the 
greatest party of the century? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps "greatness" in its various aspects cannot be introduced into the 
question of how to determine the party of the century. Where the entertainment 
consists of gawking at VIPs while presenting oneself as a VIP to be gawked at, 
enjoying the experience has no personal or social character at all -- unless 
one mirror can be said to dazzle another. Where people hardly know one another 
and, even if they do, have nothing to say to one another, then they are not 
participating in a party but merely performing for the benefit of an impersonal 
audience. Such performances are more like silent walk-on parts satisfying the 
need for a crowd in certain operas. 
</P>
<P>
No, no, the only kind of greatness that can possibly contribute to making a 
party great -- and, in the long run, making the party of the century -- is 
great-heartedness. Where everyone at the gathering knows everyone else, 
respects them and appreciates them, all will have something worthwhile to say 
to each other; where they are themselves personable and in their relationships 
sociable, there will be harmony, charm, humor. And, although it may be hoped 
that the moment lasts for a few hours at least, there will be a pause in the 
disappointments and drawbacks, the pains and sorrows of outrageous fortune in 
ordinary life during which no party is going on. The great-hearted can lose 
themselves in a group that is bigger and better than themselves. Celebrities 
can't, and therefore don't get together for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, no public event can ever be judged the party of the century -- 
such an event is not public. It is private and it is subjective; it can be 
known and shared and cherished only by those who truly participate, and it will 
have different values for different guests. How many should there be? There 
would have to be more than two, because they alone would not constitute a party 
but a friendship. It would have to be more than a few of one generation along 
with some of the generations older and younger, for that would be a family, or 
a family substitute. So the ideal group would require more than two people of 
different ages -- but a good deal fewer than 600 to 700 -- who have enough 
genuine interest in each other not to worry about their own greatness being 
contaminated.

TIMELY MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council have approved an ordinance 
to shield scarce and inexpensive Skid Row hotel rooms from being demolished to 
make way for more profitable development. A single room with a bathroom down 
the hall might not sound like much, but it is all that thousands of poor, 
elderly and disabled renters can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row's single-room-occupancy hotels house an estimated 8,000 of the city's 
poorest renters for as little as $8 per person per night. For most, the option 
is sleeping in a park or on a sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,300 cheap rooms have been demolished or converted to other uses 
since 1969, years during which the housing crisis has grown to crisis 
proportions. The ordinance's moratorium on demolition will protect the city's 
poorest renters for five years, during which time a new emphasis at City Hall 
on housing may provide more long-term solutions. The new emphasis will require 
creation of a strong, independent housing commission and substantial new 
funding, some of which could be generated by fees on commercial development to 
be used for affordable housing near the central city. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure allows owners who can make a case for extreme financial 
hardship to tear down their buildings, but they still would be required to find 
housing to substitute for each unit they destroy. The replacement provision is 
intended to guarantee that the limited supply of low-rent housing on Skid Row 
will shrink no further. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium adds no new housing, but it does buy time to expand the supply. 
Nonprofit developers, for example, can take advantage of new state housing 
funds that will be available in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year period was chosen because old hotels are being renovated and 
brought into compliance with earthquake standards at the rate of about 10 per 
year, a rate that could reach the 75 Skid Row hotels in five years. 
</P>
<P>
An accompanying moratorium will protect single-room-occupancy housing in the 
rest of the city for one year with a possibility of renewal for three years. 
The city's housing emergency makes the moratorium necessary until better ways 
can be found to preserve the most inexpensive rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
The new moratorium, an extension of shorter and less stringent demolition bans, 
required the cooperation of the mayor, the council, the city attorney, the 
Planning Department, the Community Development Department and the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. Councilman Mike Woo, the prime mover behind the 
tough five-year prohibition, deserves much credit for forging the important 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Salvaging Skid Row's limited housing supply is a tough but necessary task. A 
tiny room in an old hotel may not be much but it provides better shelter than a 
doorway or a sidewalk.

'HEROIC' VOYAGER, ITS HUMAN GUIDES

I was thrilled to read about the accomplishments of Voyager II. What 
particularly struck me was how unique our planet is. There are no other planets 
in our solar system which can support and generate life as here on Earth. 
Therefore, it is even more evident how important it is that we manage and take 
care of the scarce resources on our planet by recycling, car pooling, taking 
shorter showers, and so on. The inconvenience of these actions seems small in 
view of the potential environmental obstacles we face at the time Voyager II 
crosses the heliopause and moves into the interstellar medium.

PARKS, HOMES, BIKES, TRAINS? DEBATING RR RIGHTS OF WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, we have seen a number of proposals to alleviate the horrific traffic 
problems in Los Angeles, including a lunkheaded notion to use the L.A. River as 
an adjunct freeway, and a (facetious) proposal to create the world's most 
expensive bike path. But is the idea of a city bike path really so 
off-the-wall? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, opening the L.A. River to automobile traffic would be 
environmentally disastrous as well as counterproductive: it would only 
encourage more commuters to drive, worsening the problems of smog without 
lessening congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Why not convert the existing banks of the L.A. River to a two-way bicycle path? 
The idea is hardly farfetched. In Europe, many freeways have bicycle paths 
along them. Converting the river banks to bicycle paths would encourage people 
to bike rather than drive. The cost would be minimal indeed, and planting trees 
along the banks of the river would both beautify the area and help clear the 
air of pollutants.

Lake's article is typical of academic attitudes. The freeway system, as 
expensive as it is, is a failure. To build out of our congestion would cost 
$110 billion with no guarantee that the traffic problem would be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
It is guaranteed that it would make the smog, acid rain, global warming problem 
much worse, not better. And, of course, it would perpetuate our utter 
dependence on automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that Lake find her freshman economic textbook; look up the law of 
supply and demand; reflect on the fact that our freeways are plagued with too 
much demand, our transit systems with too little (she did get that right). Then 
write a 500-word paper to explain why these conditions exist. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that we have congestion, air pollution and even more serious ills, 
such as global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and a number of economic and 
social problems, because Americans are heavily bribed to drive their cars and 
trucks. Our transit systems have been bankrupted because the playing field is 
severely tilted economically in favor of automobile and truck use.

If we would track the reason some of our politicians are mixed up in ethical 
problems today, we'd find it all stems from one problem: too long in office. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for limiting the number of terms in office that a 
politician can serve: 
</P>
<P>
1. The longer they stay, the more temptation for graft and dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
2. Political positions were never meant for the person to become wealthy, but 
the fact is that they do. Ask yourself, how come? I thought they were supposed 
to be public servants. 
</P>
<P>
3. Low voter turnout is the result of long incumbency and is exactly what the 
incumbent wants. 
</P>
<P>
4. Politicians have one primary objective, to perpetuate themselves in office. 
To act in the best interests of their constituency is secondary.

Laura Lake expresses her dissatisfaction with a light-rail system as a solution 
to traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
She claims that light rail is an "eyesore." The stream made by a ten-lane 
highway is by no means beautiful, and the consequential pollution is ugly, 
unhealthy, and damaging to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
If $70 million seems like a lot for the right of way on Exposition Boulevard, 
how appealing is $100 million per mile of highway? Light rail is an investment 
in the future and serves to reduce pollution and traffic, something no amount 
of freeway will ever do. 
</P>
<P>
If developing these already existing rights of way into housing is any 
solution, are the new homeowners going to travel on the already congested 
roads?

Privately, Voyager project scientists have a better name for it.

THE PUSH TO RECYCLE OUR MOUNTAINS OF TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have always recycled our newspapers to save the trees. Now, for the first 
time, I can't recycle. At $5 a ton, it is not worth it to the recycler and his 
receiver. They are refusing to accept newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
I have canceled my daily paper and kept it Sunday, only because I can't stand 
to give up The Times completely. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of recycling has struggled so hard to survive and catch on. We can't 
lose that momentum, if only because the dumps are filling up so fast.

PARKS, HOMES, BIKES, TRAINS? DEBATING RR RIGHTS OF WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Lake's concern about the purchase of railroad rights-of-way, what may 
be viewed as a "hunch" by some can be fairly academic to others. For example, 
an experienced urban planner knows with the confidence of an eagle spotting its 
prey that a straight and continuous railroad right-of-way traversing an 
increasingly congested city landscape is an invaluable asset as a 
transportation corridor. He also knows that it would be a fundamental mistake 
not to acquire the right of way at the earliest opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside-to-downtown Los Angeles corridor would serve some of the fastest 
high-rise development currently under way in downtown Los Angeles. There is no 
question about its commuter potential. The alternative bus lanes suggested by 
Lake are definitely an idea worth considering. But where? Double-decking the 
Santa Monica Freeway would significantly increase noise pollution in sensitive 
areas such as Rancho Park and other neighborhoods. Make Olympic Blvd. a 
transit-only affair? I seriously doubt that the nearby streets could absorb the 
displaced traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Why not use the Exposition right-of-way? Make it a busway, light rail, 
monorail, you name it. But let's preserve the one remaining open corridor from 
the Westside to downtown.

FINLEY'S REPLACEMENTS FAIL AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
YANKEES DROP ANGELS INTO THIRD PLACE WITH AN 11-5 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Chuck Finley wrenched his left foot on that bullpen mound in Kansas City 
12 days ago, the pain was so bad he could barely walk away. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Angels really expect they could do any better? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brave words and the we'll-get-the-job-done rhetoric, the Angels, 
plainly, have failed to respond to Finley's loss. In the game he left after 
making just 17 pitches, they lost. In the first start Finley missed, they lost. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday night at Yankee Stadium -- Round 2 without Finley -- the Angels did 
more than lose. They were shelled, 11-5, by a Columbus Clippers team posing as 
the New York Yankees, allowing rookie Manager Bucky Dent to win for only the 
fourth time in his embattled 15-game tenure. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-run second inning for the Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
A home run, a double, a single and three RBIs from Randy Velarde? 
</P>
<P>
Key hits from the likes of Bob Geren and Alvaro Espinoza and two New York runs 
scoring on wild pitches in the same inning? 
</P>
<P>
Who says the Angels don't miss Finley? 
</P>
<P>
Not Angel Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"We've said all along that we've been thin since Day 1," Rader said. "We put 
great emphasis on (maintaining) the relative health of the ballclub. We were 
very concerned all along that the wrong injury at the wrong time would hurt us 
-- and that has come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck Finley is one of our best pitchers. We haven't had him for three starts 
now, and we've lost all three. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, it's hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Clark, who lasted just 4 2/3 innings in his first turn as Finley's 
replacement, didn't get out of the second inning Friday. He managed to record 
four outs -- and give up four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Clark (0-2) was one of three Angel pitchers required to complete a disastrous 
seven-run, 11-batter second inning. He merely laid the foundation, yielding a 
walk and three hits, leaving with one out and two Yankee runs in. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Rich Monteleone, who exited four batters -- and four hits -- later. He 
was followed by Edmonton recall Mike Fetters, who made his major league debut 
at Yankee Stadium and did all right for two batters, recording the necessary 
outs to close the inning, mercifully. 
</P>
<P>
But in the third, he served up a home run to Velarde, the first of the season 
for the New York utilityman. 
</P>
<P>
And in the fourth, he gave up three more runs -- two coming home on wild 
forkballs in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Before the night was through, Sherman Corbett and Willie Fraser would also 
trudge to the mound, the fourth and fifth Angel pitchers of the game. They 
served to mop up a defeat, the Angels' fourth in their last five games, that 
dropped the club into third place in the American League West behind Oakland 
and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Rader might have been able to shrug it off as one of those nights, if the same 
thing hadn't happened twice three nights earlier. Tuesday evening in Boston, 
the Angels lost a doubleheader by scores of 8-4 and 13-5, nearly wiping out 
their bullpen in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Phew," Rader said. "That's three times in five ballgames. It's kind of 
inexplicable. That hadn't really happened to us all year, and now, three times 
in four days. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know how to address it." 
</P>
<P>
Rader will have to start soon, however. With Finley expected to miss at least 
another 10 days, the Angels will have to find a way to replace him in the 
rotation at least one more time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of names to consider," Rader said before ticking them off. 
"Dan Petry, Willie (Fraser), Clark and Fetters." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they'll end up drawing straws. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Fetters hardly acquitted themselves well Friday. After surrendering 
three hits but no runs in the first inning, Clark opened the second by walking 
Steve Balboni, then yielded a single to Geren, a two-run double to Velarde and 
a one-run single to Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
After Monteleone let the game slip away -- he gave up a run-scoring double to 
Espinoza, a run-scoring single to Don Mattingly and a two-run homer to Mel Hall 
-- Fetters was ushered in, just hours after his arrival from Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by Velarde's home run in the third inning, Fetters seemed unnerved in the 
fourth, allowing successive singles to Mattingly, Hall and Jesse Barfield for 
one run before wild-pitching home two more. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know how to evaluate him," Rader said. "The kid was pitching in 
the majors for the first time and he was pitching in Yankee Stadium. He 
certainly was erratic. He did some good things, but he also threw away a couple 
forkballs that cost us runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to reserve judgement until he gets his feet on the ground. To pass 
judgement after he'd pitched for the first time at Yankee Stadium is a little 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's game was the 12th in a 15-game trip for the Angels and their 15th in 
the last 15 days. Rader was asked if his team was playing tired. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, a little bit," he replied. "I think fatigue has been a factor, which is 
very understandable. But that's not the explanation for giving up seven runs in 
the second inning. Fatigue had nothing to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
Just bad pitching. 
</P>
<P>
And this, remember, was the series Rader said the Angels had to win -- in his 
words, "winning three out of four in New York is imperative." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Angels are 0-1 in New York. Three games remain. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Neither Terry Clark nor Mike Fetters stuck around long enough after the game to 
answer questions, so Willie Fraser was designated spokesman for the beleaguered 
Angel pitching staff. Fraser said Fetters was "nervous" before getting the call 
from the bullpen in the second inning. "He was nervous when he came in to 
change (clothes) before the game," Fraser said. "I know what that's all about. 
The first one is always tough. You're trying to do so good and you're trying to 
impress so many people, you can lose track of what you're doing. And Yankee 
Stadium is a tough place to play in. He did all right." 
</P>
<P>
Fetters wasn't alone Friday night. Despite a 7-1 lead after two innings, New 
York Manager Bucky Dent said he sweated out every inning until the final out. 
"I never relax," Dent said. "Even in triple-A when I had big leads, I never 
relaxed." With the Yankees these days, you can never be sure. Before Friday, 
New York hadn't won consecutive games since July 29-30. "I wasn't even thinking 
of that," said Dent, now 4-11 as Yankee manager. "I was just worried about 
getting a couple wins here." 
</P>
<P>
Call It a Promotion: On the day every other major league team expanded its 
roster, the Yankees reduced theirs, sending rookie infielder Hensley Muelens 
back to double-A Albany-Colonie. Unlike the Yankees, Albany-Colonie is in the 
playoffs, taking a 1-0 lead over Reading with a 16-3 win Friday night in the 
Eastern League's championship series. So Muelens, who played 104 games and had 
11 home runs and 45 runs batted in with Albany, will rejoin his old teammates 
to bolster their pennant run.

MCMAHON RESCUES CHARGERS AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
BUT TOLLIVER MAY HAVE BROKEN BONE, ANDERSON TALKS IN TROUBLE 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago, the Chargers were a team in search of quarterbacks. For most of 
Friday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, they were two quarterbacks in 
search of a team. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, they found themselves. Charger starter Jim McMahon completed nine 
of 17 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns, including a dramatic four-yard 
scoring flip to Quinn Early with no time remaining to give the Chargers a 
21-20, come-from-behind victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was McMahon's only play of the second half. He had entered the game only 
because rookie Billy Joe Tolliver (13 of 23, 165 yards) injured his left 
collarbone scrambling on the previous play. Charger Coach Dan Henning said he 
expected X-rays to show that the collarbone is broken. If so, Tolliver will 
miss at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the downside was the normally reliable Charger defense. It defended 
the run poorly early on. The Chargers' special teams were mostly horrible all 
night. Nevertheless, the Chargers wound up their exhibition season with two 
victories in their last three games, a near miss against the defending world 
champion 49ers and a landslide of momentum. Phoenix finished 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had begun their comeback when rookie Marion Butts ripped one yard 
for a touchdown with 4:23 remaining to cut the lead to six points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hectic," Henning understated. 
</P>
<P>
Said McMahon: "I react a lot better when I don't have time to think." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's debut in his new home temporarily shifted the attention away from 
rapidly worsening relations between the Chargers and running back Gary 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 28, led the Chargers in rushing last year and is seeking a contract 
estimated in the $1 million-per-year range. The Chargers are offering 
considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, a source close to Anderson said Anderson, his wife and his agent 
-- Peter Johnson -- were considering "options that had nothing to do with the 
Chargers." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed, the source said Johnson and Anderson may inform the Chargers as early 
as this weekend that Anderson is prepared to sit out the year if the Chargers 
don't trade him to another team in time for the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Pending litigation filed by the NFL Players Assn. against the league has 
encouraged Johnson and Anderson to the point that they believe if Anderson sits 
out the year, he will become an unrestricted free agent -- one who could sign 
with another team for 1990 without that team having to compensate the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson works for the International Management Group in Cleveland. IMG 
represents athletes in a variety of sports. But the man who oversees all their 
football contract negotiations is Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Cindrich hasn't directly involved himself in the Anderson talks. But he hasn't 
liked what he has seen or heard. Contacted by phone Friday, he offered no 
encouragement about the Chargers chances of signing Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the best of friends with Steve Ortmayer," Cindrich said of the 
Chargers' director of football operations. "I always thought I had a better 
rapport with him until this year. To me he (Ortmayer) has been derelict in his 
duties. He commits one boner after another." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer is already on record as saying Anderson will either play for the 
Chargers this year or "not play at all." 
</P>
<P>
Cindrich ticked off a long list of Anderson's statistical accomplishments, 
including the 1,119 yards Anderson rushed for last season, third highest in the 
AFC. Cindrich also said Anderson should have a higher public profile around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Anderson really isn't a big name in the NFL," Cindrich said. "He has to 
get the hell out of there (San Diego)." 
</P>
<P>
Cindrich also said IMG recently received a letter from Anderson and his wife, 
Ollie, directing IMG to "exercise patience and expertise" in the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals scored Friday night's first points by exercising patience of 
their own in a 12-play, 62-yard drive that ended on a two-yard, play-action 
touchdown pass from Gary Hogeboom to tight end Walter Reeves. Reeves beat 
strong safety Martin Bayless and inside linebacker Gary Plummer on the 
third-and-goal play. 
</P>
<P>
The drive started on the Cardinal 38 after a 32-yard punt by Lewis Colbert 
dribbled out of bounds. Lusty boos greeted Colbert's effort; earlier this week, 
the Chargers traded former Pro Bowl punter Ralf Mojsiejenko to the Redskins. A 
15-yard face mask penalty against Charger defensive back Lester Lyles kept the 
Phoenix drive alive on third and 11. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon wasted no time bringing the Chargers right back up the field. On the 
very next possession, he found wide receiver Anthony Miller on a post pattern 
at the Phoenix 30. Miller bounced off Cardinal defenders Cedric Mack and Lonnie 
Young, regained his balance and raced into the end zone to complete a 49-yard 
scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
It was McMahon's first touchdown pass as a Charger and wouldn't have been 
possible if rookie Butts hadn't gained two yards two plays earlier on a 
fourth-and-one from the Charger 44. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix took a 14-7 lead into the locker room at halftime when Earl Ferrell cut 
back against the grain for a five-yard touchdown run with 2:39 left in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
The score should have been 14-10 after Lyles intercepted a Hogeboom throw and a 
28-yard McMahon-Miller pass gave the Chargers a first down at the Cardinal 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
But on the last play of the half Chris Bahr's 25-yard field goal attempt hit 
the left upright and bounced away. Later in the game, Bahr missed a 43-yarder, 
also wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week the Chargers cut kicker Steve DeLine, who has a more 
powerful kicking leg. Their explanation: Bahr is more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix advantage grew to 10 points early in the third quarter on Al Del 
Greco's 29-yard field goal. Del Greco added a 31-yarder in the fourth period 
after the Cardinals blocked a Colbert punt. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman, the Chargers' No. 1 draft pick, got credit for 
half a sack in the second period. It was Grossman's first game since signing 
eight days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Charger linebacker Jim Collins, a starter, pulled his left hamstring in the 
first half and didn't return. Offensive lineman Dennis McKnight tore a 
quadriceps muscle and may be out for two months.

ROSE SIMPLY BETTING HE'LL BE REINSTATED; PUBLIC DESERVES MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ross Newhan reminds us that his hands are tied because on baseball's Hall of 
Fame ballot, it says that "character and integrity" must be taken into account 
also. 
</P>
<P>
Another sports reporter from the New York Times indicated that "character and 
integrity" applied to the player on the field and not off the field. I happen 
to agree. All of a sudden, performance takes a back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sit back and condemn Pete Rose, we should truly feel sorry for him. 
He may very well be a victim of circumstances. He needs our sympathy rather 
than our condemnation.

Both Howie Long and Vann McElroy pine for the good old days in Oakland, where 
the stadium "hopped" with enthusiastic fans every week. Long says that the 
small, unenthusiastic crowds in Los Angeles don't send chills down his spine. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the silver and black to stop pointing fingers and face the facts 
-- they don't feel the chills because they seem to have left their spines in 
Oakland.

How refreshing it was to see that Ross Newhan stepped up and emphasized 
"character and integrity" in connection with Hall of Fame consideration for 
Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that there have been others who have reached the Hall of Fame 
although their character and integrity have been suspect. It is time that 
character and integrity are reintroduced to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
And what ever happened to holding people responsible for their actions instead 
of excusing them as a sickness? Pete Rose had choices -- he merely chose the 
wrong way. Seemingly, this represents a sign of weakness and not a disease.

A hearty thank you to Ross Newhan for having the guts to say he will not vote 
for Pete Rose's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped there would be more than one sportswriter who would speak out 
before waiting to see how strong public opinion was swinging. 
</P>
<P>
Newhan is right, Rose could have made it easier on himself by showing a little 
bit of humility. The fans were ready to give him the benefit of a doubt until 
that final inning in front of the TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Pete made his last strikeout.

LYE SHOOTS 66 TO TIE NORMAN, GRADY FOR LEAD

Mark Lye birdied the first three holes Friday en route to a six-under-par 66 
and a share of the second-round lead with Australians Greg Norman and Wayne 
Grady in the $800,000 Greater Milwaukee Open at Franklin, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, the first-round leader with a 64, shot a 69, while Grady had a 68 at 
Tuckaway Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The three were tied at 11-under-par 133 after two rounds on the 7,030-yard 
course that was soggy from heavy rain Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lye, playing the back nine first, birdied the 10th, 11th and 12th holes. He got 
birdies again on the second, seventh and the eighth holes, the last with a 
30-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who had a bogey on the first hole Thursday, bogeyed the second hole 
Friday. He recovered with birdies on the 524-yard sixth hole and the 197-yard 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
On the back nine, Norman birdied the 12th, a par-5, and the 14th, a par-3. He 
missed a 3-foot putt for a birdie on the par-5 16th that could have given him 
sole possession of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to be playing well," Norman said. "It's basically just a 
putting competition." 
</P>
<P>
Grady, who had a first-round 65, put together a four-birdie round Friday, but 
for the second straight day said he didn't play well, especially off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have shot 68 or 72," he said. "I didn't feel good out there; obviously 
I'm doing something right, but I have some things to work out." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Blackmar, with a 69, and David Frost, with a 67, were one shot back of the 
leaders at 134. 
</P>
<P>
Two shots back at 135 were Wayne Levi, Curt Byrum, P.H. Horgan III, Duffy 
Waldorf, Nick Price and Larry Mize. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zembriski and Jim O'Hern overcame a lengthy rain delay and shot 
four-under-par 66s to share the lead in the first round of the $300,000 Senior 
tournament at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Zembriski parred his final four holes after the 2-hour 40-minute delay at 
Marriott's Griffin Gate resort. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hern, of Louisville, Ky., was one under par at No. 8 when the rain came but 
responded with birdie putts from 18 feet on No. 12, five feet on No. 13, seven 
feet on No. 17 and a par-saving eight-footer on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, Lou Graham and Ben Smith were one shot back with 67s, while Bob 
Boldt, Rives McBee, Larry Ziegler and Harold Henning were tied at 68 in the 
field of 72 over the 6,595-yard layout. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rivero of Spain shot an eight-under-par 64 for a 130 total and a 
two-stroke lead after two rounds of the $655,000 European Masters tournament at 
Crans-Sur-Sierre, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Bennett and Barry Lane of Britain were at 132. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Severiano Ballesteros, the favorite, had a 68 and dropped into a share 
of fourth place with Emmanuel Dussart of France at 133. Ballesteros, the 
world's second-ranked player, had shared the lead with a 65 in the opening 
round of Europe's second-richest tournament, behind the British Open.

U.S. OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;

<P>
EVERT AND FOE: 19 YEARS AND WORLDS APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Chris Evert, her final U.S. Open comes to this: she must beat a player 19 
years younger, a rising star and a possible heir to her legacy. 
</P>
<P>
This changing of the guard will be done in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is playing someone old enough that she could be her mother," Martina 
Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, scored her 100th U.S. Open victory Friday, 6-2, 6-4, over Patricia 
Tarabini of Argentina to set up a fourth-round match with 15-year-old Monica 
Seles, the two-fisted slugger from Yugoslavia who grunts like Jimmy Connors and 
chuckles like Woody Woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, women's tennis will find out if she can replace somebody such as Chris 
Evert. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be an easy task. Evert has won 1,302 times with 18 Grand Slam titles 
among them. The U.S. Open, a championship which she has claimed six times, will 
be her final major tournament, and for that reason, Evert is a sentimental 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Evert dines with Donald Trump, favors limousines as her preferred method of 
street travel and wears a diamond ring the size of Manhattan. This is an image 
worthy of Evert, the grand dame of tennis, and one with which she feels most 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Seles enjoys a different image. She wears a blue-jean jacket as she walks 
around the U.S. Open grounds in the early-morning hours before her match. In 
the players' lounge, Seles puts on earphones and listens to her rock music 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
She probably isn't that much different than Evert was in 1971 as a 16-year-old 
playing in her first U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of my first year at Forest Hills . . . It is a great time for 
Monica now," Evert said. "She has no pressure because she will never go down in 
the rankings. She will grow and get better. 
</P>
<P>
"The shoe is on the other foot because I was once in her position, playing 
Billie Jean King and Margaret Court," Evert said. "The roles are reversed now." 
</P>
<P>
Seles hits hard enough to flatten the balls and grunts loudly with nearly every 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"She hits it as hard as she can, and most of the time it goes in," Navratilova 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seles has already played Evert twice, losing once in the Virginia Slims of 
Florida and winning in the final at the Virginia Slims of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But Seles is not eager to be the one playing Evert at such an historic stage. 
</P>
<P>
"It would probably be much easier for me if this wasn't her last tournament," 
Seles said. "I know that she's won so much here, and whoever will beat her here 
will be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
Evert won't really be through if she loses to Seles, though. She is still 
planning on playing on the U.S. team in the Federation Cup in October and 
reserves the right to play in a random tournament or two on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no question that this is Evert's last U.S. Open, where she 
has reached the quarterfinals in each of her 18 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova says Evert is capable of making her 56th Grand Slam event memorable 
for being something else besides her last. 
</P>
<P>
"You can just bet she is going to do everything she can to win, especially 
against someone like Seles," Navratilova said. "She's going to be tough to 
beat." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova scored a 6-4, 6-0, victory over Sabrina Goles of Czechoslovakia and 
enters the fourth round having lost only seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was breezy and mostly overcast, and Navratilova found the playing 
conditions difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just survival time," said Navratilova, who managed to avoid in swirling 
winds the same kind of fate that swept away Hana Mandlikova. 
</P>
<P>
The sixteenth-seeded and No. 15-ranked Mandlikova of Australia, was defeated, 
6-2, 3-6, 6-1, by 18-year-old Donna Faber of Hilton Head, S.C. Faber, ranked 
No. 83, turned pro only 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not that talented, but I think she's a really hard worker and with hard 
work you can come long," Mandlikova said. 
</P>
<P>
Faber will play fifth-seeded Zina Garrison in the fourth round. Navratilova 
will meet Regina Rajchrtova of Czechoslovakia, and the winner will take on 
either Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria or Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union in 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker battled breezes and Miloslav Mecir before blowing into the fourth 
round with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, seeded behind only Ivan Lendl, was baffled briefly by the wind but felt 
better when he remembered how he came from being down two sets to love to win 
his second-round match against Derrick Rostagno. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the worst conditions that I have ever had (at the U.S. Open)," 
Becker said. "It was almost impossible to play normal tennis. That's why it was 
a match with many breaks, many strange shots." 
</P>
<P>
There were 12 service breaks in the windblown match, seven of them by Becker on 
Mecir's shaky serve. 
</P>
<P>
Both 11th-seeded Jay Berger and 14th-seeded Aaron Krickstein came from two sets 
down to win their third-round matches. 
</P>
<P>
Berger defeated Ken Flach, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, and Krickstein beat 
Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, 22, is accustomed to five-set matches in the U.S. Open. This was 
his eighth, his seventh victory and the fourth time he had won after losing the 
first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Krickstein was glad it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dead tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much that could upset Krickstein, not even the fact that he's been 
left out of stories about young American tennis stars that included Andre 
Agassi, Michael Chang, Pete Samparas, Jim Courier and Berger. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein pointed out that he is nine months younger than Berger, who will be 
23 in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody must think I'm 28 or something," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Also joining the winners in the fourth round were Wednesday night's 
giant-killers -- Sampras and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras followed up his second-round upset of Mats Wilander with a 4-6, 6-4, 
6-3, 6-2 victory over Jaime Yzaga of Peru, who had beaten him in last year's 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
After knocking off four-time champion John McEnroe in the second round, 
Haarhuis won his third-round match with Miguel Nido of Puerto Rico, 7-5, 7-6 
(7-5), 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras served nine aces and made only 55% of his first serves, but he was 
opportunistic, cashing in four of his six break chances. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Haarhuis plays Krickstein and Sampras meets Berger. With McEnroe and 
Wilander gone, someone from this group is assured of reaching the semifinals 
and a possible match against Becker.

A HAPPY GRADUATION FOR TRAINER; 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH SEVENTYFIVE ENDS CANNEY'S DEL MAR DROUGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the first cocktail hour of the long Labor Day weekend approached, it was 
fitting that French Seventyfive won the $75,000-added Graduation Stakes Friday 
at the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. 
</P>
<P>
Named after a mix of champagne and brandy, French Seventyfive gave trainer Bill 
Canney his first stakes victory at Del Mar in 15 years by holding off Chime 
Song in the stretch to win the six-furlong race for 2-year-olds bred in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Champion finished third, and favored Solar Launch was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
A 63-1 longshot in his Aug. 2 debut at Del Mar -- a $50,000 maiden claimer -- 
French Seventyfive won impressively by five lengths and paid $128.60, one of 
the largest payoffs of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Canney said the margin of victory in his colt's debut frightened him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought someone might be watching, and maybe he would get claimed," Canney 
said. "I bet $2 across and hoped for the best." 
</P>
<P>
Canney said he will next race French Seventyfive at Santa Anita -- where the 
horse is trained -- and skip the one-mile Del Mar Futurity Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too far for him to go too soon," Canney said. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Martin Pedroza won his second 2-year-old stakes race of the meeting. He 
earlier guided Doyouseewhatisee to victory in the Aug. 9 De Anza Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's race was Pedroza's first aboard French Seventyfive; Rafael Meza rode 
the colt on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice pickup," Pedroza said. "Rafael told me this is a nice horse. 
(Canney) told me the horse has some speed, but I'd be better off sitting behind 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a game little horse. He tries very hard as little as he is. He's got a 
lot of guts. I think the longer he goes, the better." 
</P>
<P>
French Seventyfive is owned by the Hillside Stable of Mrs. Louis Rowan, wife of 
the late director of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, and Wheelock Whitney, who 
ran for governor of Minnesota and lost two years ago. Canney said a French 
Seventyfive was one of Louis Rowan's favorite drinks. 
</P>
<P>
French Seventyfive paid $13.60, $7 and $5.80, Chime Song $9.40 and $8 and Eddie 
Champion $18.80. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye's horse, Kimo's Kid, won the fourth race but was 
disqualified for interference on the far turn. The disqualification interrupted 
a hat trick for Delahoussaye, who won the third and the fifth races. 
Delahoussaye later won the ninth. The interference by Kimo's Kid set off a 
chain reaction that caused Amir Cedeno to be knocked off Daleclavo. Cedeno 
suffered a sprained back and sprained right wrist and will be off all mounts 
until Wednesday. . . . Actor Jack Klugman was in the winner's circle for the 
first time in nine years Thursday after his horse, Akinemod, led all the way to 
win the $32,000 allowance feature for fillies and mares. . . . Trainer Dean 
Greenman was fined $1,000 for administering Butazolidin, an anti-inflammatory 
drug, to his horse Gregg's Command before the 10th race on Aug. 2 at the Orange 
County Fair.

OATES FINALLY GIVEN CHANCE TO CALL SIGNALS AT LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he thunders down the practice field these days with a football tucked under 
his arm, Paul Oates often finds his mind wandering back to baseball. Running in 
football is exactly like running conditioning wind sprints in the outfield, he 
thinks. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly like it. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I always remember is that all the time I ran baseball wind sprints, 
no one ever tried to knock me down or take my head off," said Oates, a former 
Alemany High two-sport star who spent two years in the St. Louis Cardinals' 
baseball organization. 
</P>
<P>
"And I have to remember not to forget that," said Oates, who is now the Cal 
State Long Beach quarterback and will lead his team into Saturday's opener 
against Cal State Northridge. "If your mind wanders and you start running a 
conditioning sprint down a football field, even in a team scrimmage, that might 
be the last thing you remember for a while." 
</P>
<P>
As Oates left Alemany in 1983, the sporting world waited at the doorstep. 
College recruiters begged. He nearly accepted a scholarship that year at Long 
Beach. But pro baseball also begged. The Cardinals had picked him in the second 
round of the amateur draft, making him the 38th player chosen in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days after the draft, Oates sat and thought it all over. What he 
wanted most was, simply, a lifetime of big bucks from professional sports. And 
he decided that baseball offered the quickest and least painful route to that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, he knows now, he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
He threw lightning as a pitcher, but that wasn't good enough. For two seasons 
with the Cardinals' rookie team in St. Petersburg, Fla., and their Class-A team 
in Savannah, Ga., Oates was introduced to five pitching coaches, each of whom 
prodded and berated Oates, forcing him to change his style. Throw more curves, 
one ordered. Throw fewer curves, the next coach demanded. Throw the changeup 
more often, another coach ruled. Throw the heat, the next one said. 
</P>
<P>
And, after two years and a promise of nothing more than another year in Class-A 
ball, Oates decided that, for a change, he had something to say. 
</P>
<P>
I quit. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing just made me sick and tired of baseball," said Oates, 24, a 
senior at Long Beach who is getting his first chance to start at quarterback 
after three seasons on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1985 they brought me to spring training camp and I pitched real well," he 
said. "I got people out. I was ready to make the next logical move, to 
double-A. And then they told me I'd be spending at least another year back in 
Savannah, and I said, 'No, I don't think so.' I decided I'd had enough. Another 
year in the middle of Georgia playing single-A? Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
So he returned to Southern California, his dream of making the big bucks in the 
big leagues having been spiked. But Route No. 2, he remembered, was still a 
possible way to achieve his goal. So he called Long Beach Coach Mike Sheppard, 
who had offered Oates a scholarship two years earlier. That deal, however, was 
not still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I could come out for the team, and if I made it he'd give me the 
scholarship," Oates said. "I didn't have much choice at that point, so I 
agreed." 
</P>
<P>
He proved to Sheppard that two years of throwing a little white ball hadn't 
diminished his skill at throwing the large brown one. Sheppard handed over the 
scholarship and then told Oates that he had plenty of quarterbacks at the 
moment, thank you, and would he please redshirt for his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of him was Doug Gaynor, a marvelous passer who ranked among the top five 
quarterbacks in the nation in passing yardage in 1984 and again in 1985. So 
Oates waited. And practiced. And got knocked around a lot. And then Gaynor 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
And Sheppard departed. 
</P>
<P>
The new coach, Larry Reisbig -- who had coached at College of the Canyons for 
nine years -- welcomed another talented quarterback to Long Beach in 1986, Jeff 
Graham. Graham proceeded to pass for 2,921 yards and 20 touchdowns as a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 And suddenly, the St. Louis Cardinals didn't look to Oates to be nearly as 
nasty as they had been three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating at times," Oates said. "But I don't think of that now. Jeff 
finally graduated, thank God, and now it's my turn. I wish I had started 
playing earlier, but this is my time and I'll make the most out of it." 
</P>
<P>
The most, Oates reckons, is performing well enough to warrant a look by the 
NFL. Even though he is a muscular 205 pounds, he is only 6-feet tall, and he 
also knows the land of giants that is the NFL might well overlook him because 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want a football career," he said. "I have the mobility and the arm 
and the smarts. I know I do. Just not the size. Now I've got to show other 
people. If I was 6-2 or 6-3, I think I'd be guaranteed an honest shot at the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand them thinking 5-6 is short, but I'm a legitimate 6-feet. The 
linemen in the NFL are all 6-5 and 6-6 anyway, so I never quite understood all 
that stuff about needing 6-3 quarterbacks so they can see over the linemen. You 
don't see over them. You see around them and between them." 
</P>
<P>
Before all that, of course, is the minor problem of leading a 49er team that 
has won a total of seven games in the past two seasons into a season of 
unknowns. The test, and Oates' collection of game films he hopes will impress 
some NFL scouts, begins today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'll be nervous, but it won't bother me. As a matter of fact, I'm 
really looking forward to having that feeling and getting it over with," he 
said. "I want to get all the nervousness out of the way and go about my 
business." 
</P>
<P>
The business, of course, is one of chasing dreams.

DAY OF RECKONING FOR ROOKIE PILOT; 
</P>
<P>
BONNER MUST GUIDE CS NORTHRIDGE THROUGH LONG BEACH DEFENSE IN 1ST COLLEGIATE 
START AS QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The statistics show only 77 pass attempts in two seasons as a reserve, which is 
reason enough to be somewhat apprehensive. But there is another factor to 
consider that makes Sherdrick Bonner worthy of a warning label. 
</P>
<P>
When he crouches to take the first snap of Cal State Northridge's football 
season today, it will mark not only his first collegiate start but also only 
the fourth start of his life at the quarterback position. 
</P>
<P>
Caution: This air attack is directed by a pilot-in-training. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner will make his initial attempt to earn his wings against Cal State Long 
Beach at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. Game time is noon, high noon for a 
certain 6-foot-4, 185-pound junior who has been waiting three long years to 
take over at the controls of CSUN's offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I think of Sept. 2 I break out in a cold sweat," Bonner said before 
a practice this week. "It's hard to really say how I feel. My mind is 
completely on Saturday afternoon. I'm kind of speechless." 
</P>
<P>
No matter, others are more than willing to talk for him. It's been that way 
ever since Bonner was a redshirt freshman and was tagged "the franchise" by 
Coach Bob Burt, who compared his athletic ability to that of Randall 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Cunningham was first-team punter and a seldom-used reserve 
quarterback for a perennial National Football League doormat called the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are now playoff contenders and Cunningham is mentioned in the same 
breath as Marino and Montana among NFL quarterbacks. But Burt says the same 
label applies. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gamer," Burt said of Bonner, "and, like Cunningham, he's a big athlete 
who has played a lot of sports, he has good feet and a lot of innate ability." 
</P>
<P>
Among those inborn talents, CSUN coaches say, is a knack for avoiding defenders 
rushing in from his blind side. "It's like he's got a time clock in his head 
and when it goes off he's says, 'OK, time to make something happen,' " said Pat 
Degnan, a Northridge assistant who works with the quarterbacks. "A lot of 
things he's been God-gifted with. He does things you can't coach." 
</P>
<P>
It was Degnan who discovered CSUN's quarterback-in-the-rough while sifting 
through film at Azusa High. 
</P>
<P>
Degnan had been instructed to judge Bonner as a potential wide receiver, but 
Mark Schuster, Azusa's coach, claimed the team's quarterback wasn't good enough 
to make a fair evaluation. So, to sell his player as an athlete, Schuster 
showed film of a game with Bonner doing the signal-calling himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back and reported what I saw to Coach Burt," Degnan said. "I said, 
'Coach, I got a quarterback out there that has only played a couple of games, 
but by the time he leaves here, he could be a great one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Burt's response: Go get him. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured Pat knew what he was doing," Burt said. "I mean, there are lots of 
wide receivers who you can win with, but there aren't a lot of quarterbacks who 
are 6-4 and can do the things Sherdrick does. When you have a chance to recruit 
an athlete like that you do it and worry about where he's going to play later." 
</P>
<P>
How was Burt to know that the position Bonner wanted to play most was guard? 
</P>
<P>
Guard on the CSUN basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his redshirt season of football had ended, Bonner told the 
coaches he was trading in his pads for basketball gear. But his decision was 
short-lived. After some encouragement from Burt and Degnan, a talk with his 
parents and a conversation with Matador basketball Coach Pete Cassidy, Bonner 
decided he would play both sports. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he quit basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Degnan surmises that it just took a little extra time for Bonner to discover 
for himself what the football coaches had seen all along: an abundance of 
untapped potential as a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good basketball player, but I don't know if he would have been a great 
one," Degnan said. "But in football, with his size and rangy speed, he's a 
commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming, of course, that he lives up to his billing. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody once said that potential will get you fired, but I don't think that 
will be the case with Sherdrick," Burt said. "He got some quality playing time 
last year and we've seen him do some wondrous things in practice -- things that 
make you go whew, flashes of brillance -- but I don't think anybody has really 
seen what he can do yet." 
</P>
<P>
Burt says he is not expecting Bonner to "go out and perform miracles." 
</P>
<P>
"All he has to do," Burt said of his quarterback, "is hand the ball off, make 
the right decisions when he throws the ball and have his wits about him as far 
as adjustments and audibles." 
</P>
<P>
Bonner admits that the challenge of making the right moves has been enough to 
cause more than a few sleepless nights. 
</P>
<P>
"People think football is just lining up and running this or running that, but 
there's a lot to learn," Bonner said. "It took me a long time before I felt 
like I was field general smart enough to read defenses and make calls. I just 
wanted to go out there and play, you know, like in high school where no one 
blitzed. Now I've got guys coming at me from all directions." 
</P>
<P>
And as they chase him, he carries the added weight of great expectations -- 
both stated and implied. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner says he often wondered what he had done to deserve compliments such as 
the comparison to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
"I was honored they would say that," Bonner said, "but I haven't done anything 
to deserve that comparison. I'm penciled in to start, and I've worked my tail 
off to get that far, but beyond that I haven't accomplished anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is on. I can feel it. But that's my situation. I'll just have to 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Burt, for one, is confident he will. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Burt pointed out, Bonner "was third in the state in the high 
jump at 6-10. Someplace along the line, he had to get down to a jump-off and 
beat somebody." 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, Bonner was an All-Southern Section selection. "There had to be a 
time when he sunk the winning basket at the end of a big game," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
In football, he helped Azusa to the playoffs. "I saw him against a kid from San 
Dimas who was getting a lot of publicity," Burt said, "and he caught three 
touchdown passes -- just burned the guy." 
</P>
<P>
And the point of these examples? 
</P>
<P>
"He has all the intangibles of a winner," Burt said. "Not only does the guy 
have great athletic ability, but he picks the right time to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, against the heavily favored 49ers, would be such a time.

NEWSWIRE: AOUITA WINS 5,000 METERS, TAKES SEASON TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Said Aouita capped a brilliant season by posting the world's second-fastest 
5,000-meter time Friday to win the the Grand Prix track and field overall men's 
title for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Moroccan's time of 13:06.36 at Monte Carlo, Monaco, was 
overshadowed by an injury to his right calf, which he said might keep him out 
of next week's World Cup at Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can go," Aouita said after earning the $25,000 prize that 
goes to the overall winner of the 17-stop IAAF-Mobil Grand Prix. "I'll be 
seeing a doctor tomorrow and then I'll decide." 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympic gold-medal hurdler Roger Kingdom, who set a world record in 
the 110-meter high hurdles two weeks ago, started the day tied with Aouita for 
the men's overall lead but finished third to Colin Jackson of Britain and 
American Tonie Campbell, who tied for first in 13.22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if Kingdom had won his race and finished in a tie with Aouita, he 
would not have shared the overall title under complicated IAAF rules. 
</P>
<P>
In other events: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Olympic bronze medalist Danny Everett of Los Angeles beat world 
record-holder and Olympic silver medalist Butch Reynolds in an American 
400-meter showdown, 44.59 to 45.06. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union won the pole vault at 18 feet 8 1/4 
inches. World record-holder and Olympic champion Sergei Bubka, who has an 
injured right leg, finished fourth at 18-4 1/2, after his only jump of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Stewart of Jamaica won the 100 meters in 10.13, as two-time Olympic 
gold medalist Carl Lewis finished third in 10.30.

GROSSMONT 3-A FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
MONTE VISTA MIGHT THREATEN BIG THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAZELTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is one thing nobody can say about Ed Carberry, Monte Vista's 
first-year coach, it's that he doesn't have any drive. 
</P>
<P>
Carberry, an assistant at Tustin High School in Orange County last year, 
commuted to Monte Vista three to five times a week after he was hired last 
spring. Fortunately for Carberry, he wasn't alone; he took an entourage of 
eight assistant coaches and helpers. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were long days," said Carberry, who has since moved closer to his work. 
"We'd put 200 miles a day on the car. I knew Camp Pendleton like the back of my 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Although Monte Vista won't knock any of the Big Three -- Helix, Granite Hills 
and Mt. Miguel -- out of the front seat, the Monarchs are causing them to keep 
an eye on the rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three have won or shared every Grossmont League 3-A title since 1984. 
And it doesn't look as if the trend is going to change. 
</P>
<P>
But the Big Three are saying Monte Vista could have an impact this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If Monte Vista comes into league 4-2, 3-3 (after their nonleague games), they 
could be the team to beat," Helix Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "They're working hard, 
and they have good athletes. If he can bring them around, they could have a 
real impact." 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contenders: Helix (8-2-1), Mt. Miguel (7-4), Granite Hills (7-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Monte Vista (1-9) 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: El Capitan (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Helix at Mt. Miguel, Nov. 9. Could be any game involving the 
"Big Three," but this is the last of the year and probably will have the league 
title riding on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The man: Last year, Rob Ippolito was the man with the mono. This year, he is 
the man with the arm. Ippolito was expected to start at quarterback for Helix 
last year but contracted mononucleosis. By the time he was ready to play, Tory 
Winrow had taken over. Every coach in the league said Ippolito (6-3, 180) will 
be the dominant force this year. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Brian Giles' shoes? Giles signed with the Cleveland Indians as a 
17th-round draft pick, but while dallying on the football field last year, he 
led the league in rushing (1,592 yards), scoring (136 points) and yards per 
carry (6.8). But Granite Hills Coach Jim Mann doesn't see a change in the 
school's tradition of producing league-leading running backs. Shane Spencer was 
a top back on the junior varsity two years ago, but with Giles around, he 
played linebacker last year. All he did there was make all-league after never 
before having played the position. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Tackle Chris Donica (6-5, 277) anchors a solid line 
for Granite Hills. The Highlanders return a pair of excellent receivers in 
Frank Nunez (28 reception) and Ale Campos (19). Mt. Miguel has three quality 
running backs, and tackle Jim Hoffman (6-5, 265) will be responsible for giving 
them some room to run. Monte Vista's Deron Claiborne threw for 100 yards a game 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on defense: The league has a tradition of hard-hitting 
defenses. Gary Walton (6-4, 215) is just a junior, but he will continue a line 
of strong linebackers at Helix. Eric Zenor (6-2, 210) returns at outside 
linebacker for Granite Hills. El Capitan nose guard Greg Gutierrez (5-9, 190) 
is a solid lineman. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Buddy, can you spare a quarter: Running backs have been the strength of the 
league the past few years, but this year, three of the five teams returns a 
starting quarterback, and a fourth -- Helix -- probably has the league's best. 
Only El Capitan does not return a quarterback with varsity experience. Besides 
Ippolito, who played a few downs last season, the returners include Mt. 
Miguel's Steve Lindley (6-0, 190), Claiborne and Granite Hills' Bobby Howe. 
Lindley completed just 42 passes, but for 1,009 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Who will be back on top? There has been an all-section caliber running back 
returning the past five years. But new people will run the ball this season. 
Along with Spencer at Granite Hills, Mt. Miguel has three backs to replace Gene 
Ethridge (1,363 yards, 13 TDs). Victor Ware (5-9, 170) saw some playing time 
last season for the Matadors, but he will have to contend with sophomore Earl 
Bryers and senior Corey White, who started at tailback for Glendale last year. 
Arnaiz thinks he has a solid back in junior Jarret Parr (5-11, 170), who played 
in Maryland last year and in Texas as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a banner year: If Carberry needs to be reminded of the job he has 
to do in order to get Monte Vista to the top, all he has to do is look for 
championship banners in the Monarchs' gym. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going on 30 years, and there is only one bullet up there," said Carberry, 
referring to the 1984 league championship Monte Vista shared with Mt. Miguel. 
"There wasn't a lot of pride in the football program." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Carberry is working on is restoring that pride. Since the 1984 
season, Monte Vista has steadily declined and last year had the worst record 
(1-9) since the Monarchs were 1-7 in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody felt they were second-class because they hadn't won," Carberry said.

GROSSMONT 2-A FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO BE SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAZELTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To get an idea of just how bizarre last season was in the Grossmont 2-A League, 
look at Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
The Norsemen went to the playoffs for the first time in school history -- and 
officially finished 0-11. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the regular season, it appeared there was a three-way tie for 
first in the four-team league. But finding someone willing to take the title 
was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont was playing the best of any league team by season's end but forfeited 
two games because of an ineligible player. Then, for the same reason, Valhalla 
forfeited its forfeit victory over Grossmont, giving a loss to both teams. The 
result was that Santana and Valhalla each won its first league title as 
co-champs, and Grossmont was knocked out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't the end. After the playoffs, Valhalla forfeited its entire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"After what happened to Grossmont I asked (the players) not to wear (their 
league champion patches)," Valhalla Coach Carl Iavelli said. "But most of them 
didn't listen. I tried to sell them to (Santana Coach) Doug Coffin, but he 
wouldn't take them. They were the wrong colors." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing on the agenda for the coaches this season was a seminar in 
making sure the paper work was properly filled out. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contenders: Grossmont (5-5, including two forfeits), Santana (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Valhalla (6-5 before forfeiting season). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: El Cajon Valley (1-9), West Hills (first year). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Santana at Grossmont, Nov. 3. With majority of team 
returning, Grossmont wants to prove who the league champion really was. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The man: After being the "Mystery Man" last season, Grossmont quarterback 
Trevor Hanks may get a chance to drop the first part of that this year. Hanks 
was overshadowed by Mr. Everything -- Rick Daynes, who rushed for 792 yards, 
caught 21 passes and played linebacker. Hanks quietly led the league with 975 
yards passing and nearly 17.5% of his completions (80) were for touchdowns 
(14). 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Rick Daynes shoes? All Jack Bewley had to do was take a couple 
steps backward. Bewley (6-3, 210) learned the position last year while blocking 
for Daynes at fullback. He was also an all-league middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will be losing much with Bewley," Grossmont Coach Judd 
Hulbert said. "He's a little bigger than Daynes, and he has better hands." 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Santana quarterback Ferdi Hollis (6-2, 200) 
returns, and Andy Penwarden (5-11, 180) will have to take over for running back 
Steve Cardoza (15 touchdowns and 99 yards per game). Scott Lapinski (5-11, 220) 
returns at running back for Valhalla. He rushed for 386 yards in six games 
while playing hurt most of the season. Quarterback Joey Fitzgerald threw for 
1,400 yards and 13 touchdowns against junior varsity competition for West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on defense: West Hills linebacker Craig Threlfall (6-0, 210) is 
making an impression on league coaches, and he has yet to play a down against 
varsity competition. Strong safety Jason Eatherton (6-0, 176) will lead an 
improved Santana defense. Linebacker Mike Jackson (6-2, 225) and safety Erik 
Weichelp (5-10, 175) are among seven returning starters for Grossmont's 
league-leading defense. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Returners with a vengeance: The theme around the Grossmont locker room this 
season is "It's Hiller Time." With the bitter taste of last year in 18 
returning lettermen's mouths, the Foothillers are ready to prove who was the 
best team last season. Grossmont was knocked out of the playoffs when a rarely 
used player was found to have violated an intra-district transfer rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of seniors, and they want to prove to everybody they should have 
been in the playoffs," Hulbert said 
</P>
<P>
With eight all-league players returning, several coaches said Grossmont could 
be the best team in the conference. And that includes the 3-A league. 
</P>
<P>
Tying up the playoffs: After the league almost wound up with three of its four 
teams tied for the league title and in the playoffs, San Diego Section coaches 
quickly decided to make an amendment to the post-season selection criteria. 
Under normal circumstances, the league would have only been guaranteed one 
playoff spot because there were just four teams. But section rules dictated 
that all co-champions must be given a playoff berth. That would have meant that 
one fourth of the 2-A playoff teams would have come from the Grossmont when 
only one or possibly two normally would have been taken. In the future, 
co-champions will not be guaranteed playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
New kid in town: West Hills will play its first varsity season with no seniors. 
The Wolfpack were 8-2 against junior varsity teams last season, but Coach Steve 
Sutton doesn't expect West Hills to be as successful against varsity 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hard work will pay off when they're seniors," Sutton said. "Some 
of the hard knocks they get will help them next year." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of West Hills gives the league five teams and two guaranteed 
berths in the playoffs.

Solvitur ambulando, the Jesuits used to say -- we'll work it out as we go

"Measure for Measure" at the Old Globe Theatre, and the results are 
surprisingly convincing. 
</P>
<P>
Hall came to the production late, as a substitute for the ill John Hirsch (who 
died Aug. 1 of AIDS). A program note suggests that Hall not only didn't have a 
concept for the show in his pocket, he didn't know the play all that well. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who does know "Measure for Measure"? This is one of Shakespeare's 
iffiest "comedies," a dish whose ingredients strike us as none too wholesome. 
Isn't it comical the way the Duke (Richard Easton) sneaks around Vienna in his 
monk's outfit, checking out everybody's behavior once they think he's gone? 
</P>
<P>
Not when you see what it leads to, no. And not when you consider what the 
Duke's real motives are. The city has become a moral stew, thanks to his own 
negligence. So he will pretend to go off to the country, let things go from bad 
to worse (in fact, assist them) and then magically appear to make everything 
right -- to mete out justice and, of course, mercy. 
</P>
<P>
And, incidentally, to get the girl. Machiavelli would have approved of this 
plot. Shakespeare seems to have his doubts, judging from his description of the 
Duke as "the Duke of dark corners" and from the many heavy-hearted passages 
about lust, poison, guilt and retribution. 
</P>
<P>
Still he's stuck with the comic mechanics of the play. Something feels uneasy 
and the golden note of comic forgiveness isn't struck at the end of the play, 
although the motions are gone through. 
</P>
<P>
How to stage "Measure for Measure"? An inch at a time. At least that is Hall's 
solution. He gives each scene its due, and lets the audience decide where 
Shakespeare is writing to formula and where his heart is in it. 
</P>
<P>
There are hints, of course, as to Hall's opinion. The final scene where the 
Duke plays God is enacted on a floor made not of marble, but of plywood -- and 
second-cut plywood at that. Up to now, set designer Ralph Funicello has made us 
believe in his Vienna, but here he allows us to see that it is a theatrical 
construct, and the implication can be transferred to the scene being played, if 
we wish. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and his designers (Lewis Brown, costume; Peter Maradudin, lighting) don't 
overdo this sort of comment. But we can see them lurking in the shadows, not 
unlike the Duke. Hall's actors, however lack this sort of ironic 
double-mindedness. They go at their characters as if they believed in them. 
</P>
<P>
Easton's Duke absolutely adores hearing people's confessions and getting them 
into trouble. It is almost as good as having a life of one's own. A 
psychoanalyst might say that he is headed for a breakdown but for the moment he 
feels marvelously in touch with himself. For Easton's Duke, "Measure for 
Measure" is definitely a comedy, perhaps even a puppet show. What fun to pull 
the strings! 
</P>
<P>
For Stephen Markle as Angelo -- the Duke's second in command, on whom he gets 
the goods -- it is a tragedy. A 1985 Mark Taper Forum "Measure for Measure" 
made Angelo a bore. Markle makes him fascinating -- a sincere hypocrite. A 
"moral" man, merely because he has never been tempted to be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Flooded suddenly by lust for the innocent Isabella, he finds himself astonished 
by the force of his emotions, including a cruelty more joyous than anything he 
has ever felt. This "angel" turns devil at a shot. Shakespeare's heart is 
absolutely in these scenes, and Markle plays them with the truth of the damned. 
</P>
<P>
Nance Williamson plays Isabella as a wise virgin who refuses to be shaken by 
what she has discovered about the perfidy of men -- not only Angelo, but her 
own brother Claudio (a rather recessive Michael Cerveris). It's a sensible 
performance, but it is hampered by a tendency to hammer out lines rather than 
thinking them through, a problem heard elsewhere in the cast as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tempo is obviously one of Hall's desiderata in this production. It sometimes 
leads to a runtogether text, as if the space bar had broken on a word 
processor. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a problem with Easton, who phrases superbly, even if he does 
sometimes fall into Gielgudisms. And it is not a problem with James Winker 
admirably sleazy as the good-for-nothing boulevardier, Lucio. Winker is very 
much into the time frame of the show (Vienna in Freud's day), as is Jeffrey 
Alan Chandler, whose Pompey suggests a dainty, nasty silent-film comic -- Fatty 
Arbuckle, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 (Lewis Brown's costumes are a great help here and also solve more complicated 
problems.) 
</P>
<P>
The physical and psychological atmosphere is dark and repressive, with a sense 
that the barbarians are at the borders of the city. While the Duke fiddles, 
Vienna is on the point of burning. This "Measure for Measure" has room to make 
such a statement while also allowing the play as much laughter as it deserves 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has said that he didn't want to be a naughty boy in his first directing 
assignment after being fired as the artistic director of the Dallas Theatre 
Center, and he hasn't been. But he has taken the measure of a naughty play.

Robert Koehler's Aug. 18 review of the Colony Studio Theatre's production of 
"Guys and Dolls" was unnecessarily harsh in its reference to the orchestra. 
I'll agree that "there's no substitute for a full-bodied orchestra," but in a 
99-seat house, that's impossible. Any more than two musicians is unusual, and 
11 players is nothing short of remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mr. Koehler should restrict his reviews to the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, where space and budget permit more Wagnerian musical forces.

LOS MARIACHIS UCLATLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It takes nothing away from Richard Vasquez's interesting article on women 
mariachis to note one error ("Women Are Spicing Up the World of Mariachi 
Music," Aug. 26.) 
</P>
<P>
Los Mariachis Uclatlan was not started by Mark Fogelquist. Donald Borcherdt 
founded it in 1961 as a performance study group of the UCLA Institute of 
Ethnomusicology. 
</P>
<P>
The founding members included a Javanese guitarron player who spoke no Spanish 
but sang so convincingly that Mexican listeners frequently mistook him for a 
countryman; a Japanese Imperial Court musician playing violin; an American 
elementary school teacher whose singing could give Lola Beltran a run for the 
money, and several other Anglos, including the undersigned on violin.

FAMILY SPOTS: A WALK IN TREEPEOPLE'S ORGANIC GARDEN OF DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday at 11 a.m., the TreePeople people will offer a free tour of their 
42-acre site. Set in the middle of Coldwater Canyon Park, TreePeople's 
hourlong, weekly tours are geared to appeal to visitors of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be taken on a tour of the organic garden, where volunteers will 
talk about how they keep the bugs and other garden pests away (nets for snails, 
herbs with odors bugs don't cotton to, mulching with wood chips). The penned-up 
chickens and opossum usually are a draw for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
TreePeople is an environmental problem-solving group that works on creating 
solutions to ecological problems in Southern California. The group has 
championed drought- and smog-tolerant gardening as well as emphasizing the 
importance of trees in an overall clean-air policy. 
</P>
<P>
TreePeople hosts tours for 50,000 schoolchildren a year as part of its 
educational program. Whether on a classroom field trip or a Sunday walkabout 
with their parents, children are quick studies when it comes to the importance 
of water conservation and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
After the walk, families may shop in the group's nursery of drought- and 
smog-tolerant plants or continue their outing on the many trails of the 
surrounding park. Picnicking here is pretty much limited to wide spots along 
the trails. 
</P>
<P>
TreePeople is at 12601 Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles. Information: (213) 
273-8733.

DAY HIKE: THIS YEAR, IT TAKES LONGER TO REACH MT. SAN GORGONIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us in the Southland have looked east and marveled at Mt. San Gorgonio, 
the highest peak in Southern California. The 11,499-foot mountain is most 
striking in winter when its snow-covered peak can be seen reaching far above 
the metropolis. In summer, the view from the basin is not so spectacular; the 
dull-gray granite summit is hard to find among the hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
But summer and early autumn are the best seasons in the alpine high country, 
allowing you to look down at what you left behind. From the top, there's a 
360-degree panoramic view from the Mexican border to the southern Sierra, from 
the Pacific Ocean to the far reaches of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely, however, that you'll be able to climb Mt. San Gorgonio and 
return in a single day. The Forest Service has relocated the trailhead, and 
what was once a long (16-mile) day hike is now a very long and very steep 21 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
"But that makes it impossible to reach the peak in a day," you object. 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Forest Service planners figure that foot traffic through fragile alpine 
areas will decrease if the great peak is harder to hike. And to the Forest 
Service, fewer hikers means fewer administrative problems and fewer rangers 
sent out on patrol. The Forest Service also figures that hikers will enjoy the 
new trailhead and that the day hike's increased length will lead to increased 
solitude at South Fork Trail's intermediate destinations: South Fork Meadows 
and Dollar Lake. 
</P>
<P>
And these destinations -- along with Dry Lake and some inviting meadowland -- 
are lovely. Of course, ambitious hikers in top form will want to make the 
21-mile round-trip trek all the way to the top of Old Grayback for the best 
view of Southern California available to a hiker. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From Interstate 10 in Redlands, exit on California 
38. As you head up the highway into the San Bernardino National Forest, 
remember to stop at the Mill Creek Ranger Station just beyond the hamlet of 
Mentone and pick up your wilderness permit. At the station, you can also pick 
up maps and the latest trail information. The ranger station has a self-service 
booth outside that dispenses permits. Permits are limited; alternative routes 
may be offered at the ranger station. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the highway 19 miles past the ranger station to Jenks Lake Road. Turn 
right and proceed 3 miles to the new South Fork trailhead. The Forest Service 
closed the Poopout Hill trailhead and opened this one in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From the parking area, you cross Jenks Lake Road and pick up the 
unsigned trail. The path ascends moderately through a mixed pine forest. Enjoy 
the occasional views of Sugarloaf Peak behind you and San Gorgonio ahead. About 
1 1/2 miles from the trailhead, you'll intersect Poopout Hill Road, now closed 
to vehicle traffic. Continue straight ahead and another three-fourths of a mile 
of travel brings you to an intersection with the old Poopout Hill Trail. Bear 
right here. 
</P>
<P>
Continue ascending through the woods. In a mile, South Fork Creek appears on 
your left, and you parallel it toward South Fork Meadows, also known as Slushy 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of tiny streams, which form the headwaters of the Santa Ana River, roam 
through the ferns and wispy waist-high grasses. Lower South Fork Meadows Trail 
Camp and Middle South Fork Meadows Trail Camp offer places to picnic. 
</P>
<P>
You can also locate an idyllic picnic spot beneath the ponderosa pine and white 
fir. If you're not feeling especially energetic, you could spend a day in South 
Fork Meadows and be quite happy. 
</P>
<P>
The more energetic will continue on the trail as it skirts the west edge of the 
meadow and reaches a junction. The left fork, Whitewater Trail, heads toward 
Dry Lake (another fine day-hike destination) and the summit of Mt. San 
Gorgonio. You take the right fork, South Fork Trail, and begin switchbacking up 
wooded slopes. 
</P>
<P>
After a mile of climbing, first through ponderosa pine and then through 
lodgepole pine, you'll begin a long contour around the wall of the basin that 
holds Dollar Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The trail passes a manzanita-covered slope and reaches a junction 1 3/4 miles 
from South Fork Meadows. Go left. In a few hundred yards you reach another 
junction and turn left again. Follow the easy quarter-mile trail down the basin 
wall to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Lake, so named because it gleams like a silver dollar, is one of the 
most popular back-country spots in the San Gorgonio Wilderness and is another 
ideal place to picnic or laze away a day. Return to the main trail the way you 
came. 
</P>

YOUR STAMPS: LIMITED VALUE OF COVER THAT WAS SIGNED IN 1840S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a letter dated Aug. 3, 1844. It is a sheet of paper that was 
folded and addressed. There is no stamp, just a signature and some initials 
written above the signature. Could it be that the postmaster canceled the 
letter by his initials? Does it have any value? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You have what is known philatelically as a stampless cover. Before the 
use of adhesive postage stamps became widespread in the United States in the 
1850s, stampless covers were the customary way to send letters. 
</P>
<P>
A person of the pre-stamp period merely wrote a letter on a sheet of stationery 
purchased from a local stationer's shop, then folded it, often sealing the edge 
with wax, and writing the destination on the blank side of the sheet. Then a 
handwritten or ink-stamped postal marking was applied with notations usually 
showing the town of origin and the rate of postage in cents. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the letter is old doesn't mean much. Most stampless covers of the 
1840s sell for a few dollars each, especially if from large towns such as New 
York or Philadelphia. If the town is less known, or if inside the cover is an 
exotic written message, such as war information, gold-rush tales or whaling 
descriptions, then a stampless cover can be of value. Likewise, it is of some 
worth if written by a famous person. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it possible to touch a stamp with your hands without damaging it? My 
local stamp dealer says I should always use stamp tongs. 
</P>
<P>
A: Like all rules, the procedures for handling stamps can be altered if you are 
knowledgeable enough to know what you are doing in violating the standard 
techniques. For cheap stamps costing less than a dollar each, it is often 
practical to touch them with your hands. For rare and expensive issues, always 
use tongs to avoid damaging the paper by such things as bending the stamps, 
getting them dirty or transferring oils from your skin. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When President Kennedy was assassinated, a commemorative stamp was issued in 
his honor. I have several sheets of them: a 5-cent gray issue with Kennedy's 
portrait and the eternal flame. Have these stamps increased in value over the 
years? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. With a first-day sale date of May 29, 1964, about half a year after the 
President's assassination, the stamps that you own are 25 years old. But 
because they were printed with a press run of more than 500 million copies, 
they can't possibly be worth more than face value now. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have about a hundred picture post cards from various states, dating from 
about 1935. Are these of value? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably not. Most post-1910 cards are of little value.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: SPATHODEA CAMPANULATA: AFRICAN TULIP TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FRENCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tropical tree with brilliant, showy flowers 
</P>
<P>
The African tulip tree is rare in Southern California, probably because it is 
from tropical Africa (western Kenya and Uganda) and needs special conditions to 
grow here. But it is slowly gaining popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Some horticulturists say that much of the year, Spathodea campanulata is not 
such a good-looking tree; that during the winter, when the leaves have fallen 
off, its structure and twiggy limbs do not make an attractive picture. (In our 
climate it is deciduous; in more tropical areas -- Hawaii, for instance -- it 
is not.) 
</P>
<P>
The big however, the plantsmen say, is that starting in September it bursts 
into bloom with the most brilliant orange-red flowers tipped in yellow. Set in 
clusters, they unfurl what looks like the clutched furry brown fingers of an 
upturned hand. And the blooming keeps up for about two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
The large, multiple, dark-green leaves are about 2 feet long, with four to 
eight pairs of leaflets. There is an even rarer version that has yellow 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the oldest -- about 40 years old and 45 to 50 feet tall with equal 
spread -- is growing at the San Diego Zoo, at Bear Canyon. In the West Los 
Angeles area, there is another large one (about 35 feet) on Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A much smaller one (but just as spectacular) is on the UCLA campus at Circle 
Drive and Tiverton Avenue. At the time the tree is in flower, red-yellow aloe 
spikes bloom at its base, giving the illusion that orange-red paint is dripping 
out of the tree and splashing on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Usually planted as a specimen tree, it must be protected from the wind and cold 
-- it is sensitive to 28 degrees; the limbs are brittle. An older tree will 
recover from frost damage but a younger one might not. It does best in coastal 
areas (but not right on the ocean). It does not like heavy clay soil and needs 
full sun to bloom. In the summer months it likes water. 
</P>
<P>
Available at Coastal Zone Nursery in Malibu (24-inch boxes and up), Rancho 
Soledad Nurseries in Rancho Santa Fe (15- and 35-gallon) and from your local 
nursery if ordered from San Marcos Growers in Santa Barbara. LINDA FRENCH

NO SUSPENSION FROM USD; 
</P>
<P>
PUNISHMENT METED OUT TO CROSS-BURNING FRATERNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A series of punishments short of suspension have been meted out to the 
University of San Diego fraternity whose members burned a cross at Torrey Pines 
State Reserve the night of May 20, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-member Theta Lambda chapter was placed on three years' probation, and 
its members will be required to perform 25 hours of community service, attend 
workshops on racial and cultural biases, and remind new members at initial 
meetings each semester of the incident and "how appalling and offensive the 
cross burning was to the university and the San Diego community." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Burke, USD vice president and dean of students, said Thursday that he 
decided not to suspend the fraternity because "USD is a powerful institution 
and education is a powerful antidote to the kind of ignorance displayed last 
May." 
</P>
<P>
A dozen fraternity members and 17 pledges were caught by a state park ranger as 
they were planting and lighting a wooden cross on an isolated bluff as part of 
an initiation ritual. One student, Jeffrey Schizas, 21, is scheduled to appear 
in Municipal Court on Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge of starting a fire in 
an area of the park where burning is prohibited. The area contains rare Torrey 
Pines trees. 
</P>
<P>
Schizas signed a written statement on the night of the incident describing the 
ritual as based on a vision seen by the Roman emperor Constantine. The 
fraternity's emblem incorporates a cross. 
</P>
<P>
Members told police at the time that the initiates make a list of their faults, 
then burn the list in the fire of the cross as a symbolic way of cleansing 
themselves for membership. The fraternity later apologized for carelessness in 
starting a fire in the nature reserve, but said it did not mean to link the 
cross burning to racial or cult activities. 
</P>
<P>
But Burke said the cross burning "violated the educational mission of the 
university and brought embarrassment, scorn and ridicule to all members of our 
community. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the question, 'How could committed young men participate in an 
activity so offensive to their fellow human beings?' As a Catholic university 
that stands for the dignity of all, we were further appalled," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, by keeping the fraternity members "here on campus, with their 
nose to the grindstone for the next three years, we will be able to expose them 
to sensitivity workshops and other educational vehicles that will combat such 
insensitive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
USD officials said Thursday that the discipline will stand regardless of the 
legal outcome against Schizas. They said the fraternity members have told them 
they will adhere to the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
During probation, "any violation of the student code or illegal activity will 
result in immediate suspension of the chapter," Burke said.

BAIL $300,000 FOR PROF IN POT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bail was set at $300,000 Friday for San Diego State University professor Jack 
David Mooers, who was arrested with two other men on charges of growing 
hundreds of marijuana plants on his 50-acre ranch in Jamul. 
</P>
<P>
Mooers, 57, and the two others appeared before U. S. Magistrate Roger McKee. 
James Wesley Johnson, 44, was ordered held on $200,000 bail. Bail for Bartolo 
Espinoza Mercado, 36, of Mexico, was set at $100,000 cash. Prosecutors argued 
that Espinoza's bail should be set in cash because he is considered a flight 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Howard Frank appeared on behalf of Mooers and Johnson, who is Mooers' 
half brother, and announced that the two men's bail would be secured with 
property owned by Mooers' wife, Betty Mooers, and her former husband, William 
Dervon. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, were 
arrested Thursday when agents from the Narcotics Task Force raided the ranch 
and seized 614 marijuana plants valued at about $750,000 and several vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked on federal charges of conspiracy to cultivate and distribute 
marijuana. Each could be sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in federal prison 
and fined thousands of dollars if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Mooers, a professor of education, has taught at SDSU since 1968. School 
officials said he is a part-time professor and helps prepare classes for future 
teachers.

POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED AFTER CRASH ON I-8 KILLS 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty San Diego police officer was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving 
and vehicular manslaughter after the car he was driving crashed late Thursday 
night on Interstate 8 in Imperial County, killing two other men in the car as 
they headed for a weekend of dove hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested by the California Highway Patrol was Kevin Rausis, 28, a seven-year 
veteran of the San Diego Police Department currently assigned to its traffic 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The one-car accident killed Rausis' brother, Kenneth Rausis, 38, and a 
brother-in-law, John Walker, 27. Another brother-in-law, Michael Walker, 40, 
was flown by Life Flight to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was listed 
Friday night in critical condition with head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
All four men were from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP spokesman said Rausis, who was treated for minor injuries at El Centro 
Regional Medical Center, was released on his own recognizance pending an 
investigation and an analysis of his blood for the presence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
A blood sample was taken from Rausis and was being kept by authorities until it 
could be tested, CHP Officer Dave Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
The four men were eastbound on I-8 about 11:30 p.m. Thursday when Kevin Rausis, 
who was driving the four-wheel-drive station wagon, reportedly got distracted 
while trying to change a tape in his cassette player, Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
Rausis, who was traveling about 65 m.p.h. -- legal for that stretch of highway 
-- looked up and saw a slower-moving car ahead of him, Watts said. Rausis tried 
to swerve to miss the slower vehicle, and his own vehicle skidded and 
overturned, ejecting the Walker brothers, Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators at the scene detected an odor of alcohol and an empty beer 
bottle, Watts said, and arrested Rausis.

LA JOLLA WRITER HAL G. EVARTS JR., 74, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE McGARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal G. Evarts Jr., a 49-year resident of La Jolla whose literary career spanned 
more than 50 years and included stints as a free-lance writer, journalist and 
novelist, died Sunday after a fall at home. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas native collected two Edgar Allan Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers 
of America for his novels "Treasure River" in 1964 and "Smugglers' Road" in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, he started writing adventure and mystery stories for young 
readers, including the popular "Big Foot." 
</P>
<P>
The American West was the theme of many of Evarts' earlier novels, including 
"Colorado Crossing," "Man Without a Gun" and "The Sundown Kid." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1936 from Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor's 
degree in English, Evarts traveled around the world. He incorporated his 
experiences in such remote areas as Tibet and western China into magazine 
articles, short stories and novels. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote 28 novels and more than 100 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts' writing career began in 1935 as a reporter with the San Diego Evening 
Tribune. In 1939, he signed on with the European edition of the New York Herald 
Tribune in Paris. After only a few months as a foreign correspondent, he was 
out of a job when the impending German occupation forced the office to suspend 
operations in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Europe in 1945 as a combat historian before settling in La Jolla 
the same year and resuming his career as a free-lance writer. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts is survived by his wife, Dorothea Abbot Evarts; a daughter, Ginger 
Wadsworth of Orinda; sons John of Santa Ynez and Bill of San Diego and five 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The family requests that friends remember him with gifts to the Anza-Borrego 
Desert Natural History Assn., Hal G. Evarts Memorial Library Fund, P.O. Box 
311, Borrego Springs, CA 92004.

LA JOLLA MAN, 2 OTHERS HELD IN 'BOILER ROOM' FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Jolla man is among three telephone salesmen arrested in connection with a 
clandestine "boiler room" fraud that swindled at least $250,000 from 20 
customers who thought they were investing in silver and platinum futures, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service inspectors and Newport Beach police arrested three 
suspects, all of whom had worked for Eastern Financial Services, an 
unregistered precious-metals telemarketing business that operated out of 
several locations in Newport Beach from late 1987 through January, 1989, 
according to Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of EFS, Eric M. Dickey, was arrested last January on three counts of 
wire fraud. Dickey was convicted and sentenced to four years in federal prison 
while the investigation continued. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said investigators arrested Michael J. Mears, 27, outside his La Jolla 
home early Thursday morning, then took James D. Murdoch, 26, of Newport Beach 
into custody Thursday afternoon at his work in Newport Beach. Robert L. Daigle, 
27, of Garden Grove, was arrested Friday morning at the same Newport Beach firm 
when he arrived to get his paycheck, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
All three were booked on suspicion of telemarketing fraud and were being held 
in the city jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said the three used "classic high-pressure telephone sales" to cheat at 
least 20 clients out of a total of $250,000. They face charges of grand theft, 
conspiracy, and telemarketing fraud and federal charges of mail fraud and wire 
fraud, he said.

LOCKHEED GAS LEAK A FALSE ALARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators inspecting a Lockheed Corp. research facility near Santa Clarita 
found no evidence that it was an escape of toxic materials that caused seven 
workers to be taken to hospitals Thursday night, despite reports of a cloud of 
odorous, blue-colored gas in the building, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials specialists from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, 
the county Department of Health Services and Lockheed checked the three-story 
building at 25100 Rye Canyon Road at about 11 p.m. Thursday but were unable to 
detect the source of a reported vapor cloud inside, officials from the county 
and Lockheed said. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which was evacuated, was reopened at midnight, said James W. 
Ragsdale, spokesman for Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that, as far as we can determine, it was a false alarm," 
Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that because of all the attention that's been given in recent months 
to health and safety matters at Lockheed, there's a high degree of sensitivity 
to that whole subject on the part of virtually everybody who works there." 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Lockheed employees have alleged in lawsuits and workers' 
compensation claims that they were made ill by materials used by the company. 
Lockheed agreed in June to pay $1.49 million in penalties for 440 violations of 
federal workplace safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guards Smelled Odor 
</P>
<P>
Two security guards who entered the building shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday 
complained of skin and throat irritation after noticing an unusual odor and 
what they described as a blue-colored cloud inside, Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
"What the employees may have seen was simply water moisture in the air as seen 
through the light of some mercury vapor lights used in that building," Ragsdale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The guards and another worker were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia for observation, and four others were transported to Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, authorities said. All were released a 
short time later, a hospital spokeswomen said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 employees working in nearby buildings also were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how many of the patients actually reported ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Wanglin, a spokeswoman for the county Health Services Department, said 
all seven workers complained of sore throats. One also experienced itching and 
another reported nasal irritation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Ingram, a spokeswoman for Henry Mayo hospital, said two of the patients 
taken there reported no symptoms and the third complained of skin irritation, 
but said it cleared up before arrival at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Holy Cross hospital would not release information about the 
patients taken there.

TRUCK RAMS SEMITRAILER NEAR CASTAIC; 2 DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were killed Friday and three lanes of the Golden State Freeway near 
Castaic were briefly closed when a flatbed truck rear-ended a semitrailer 
truck, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, a 45-year-old man and his 39-year-old wife from Sacramento, were 
not identified because investigators were unable to notify their family. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Stark said both victims were in the flatbed truck, which ran into 
the rear of the semitrailer truck about 5:30 a.m. in a southbound lane of the 
freeway near the Templin Highway exit. 
</P>
<P>
Stark said the flatbed was carrying a load of barrels filled with small 
electrical engines and car parts. The truck was headed down an incline in the 
freeway and struck the other truck for an unknown reason. The barrels slid 
forward, crushed the truck cab and spilled onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims were dead at the scene. The driver of the trailer-truck, Dennis 
Smith, 28, of Scappoose, Ore., was not injured. Three lanes of the freeway were 
closed for an hour while the debris was cleared.

<TEXT>
<P>
. . . Where the Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where 
man himself is a visitor who does not remain . . . which is protected and 
managed to preserve its natural condition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wilderness, as defined by the federal Wilderness Act of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday is the 25th anniversary of the nation's wilderness preservation system. 
It is cause for celebration, and two events are scheduled this weekend to honor 
the San Gorgonio Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
This wilderness includes 58,969 acres, 100 miles of hiking trails and Southern 
California's highest peak: Mt. San Gorgonio. With the help of dedicated 
conservationists and the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act, the San Gorgonio 
Primitive Area, as it was known in the 1930s, was saved from becoming a giant 
ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Krueper, founding member of the Defenders of the San Gorgonio Wilderness, 
will be the speaker at 8 tonight at the Grayback Amphitheater in the San 
Bernardino National Forest, just off California 38 about 10 miles east of 
Angeles Oaks. She will explain how conservationists succeeded in designating 
the area and getting it included in the national act 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., at the Barton Flats Visitors Center, the 
Forest Service will host a variety of activities designed to celebrate our 
wilderness heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations of "primitive skills" such as horse-packing and woodsmanship are 
scheduled. The San Gorgonio Search and Rescue Team will explain its purpose, 
and REI, a commercial equipment chain, will present the latest in backpacking 
equipment. Nature photographer Roy Murphy will be on hand to sign his San 
Gorgonio Wilderness poster. Several speakers will discuss wilderness ethics and 
describe the intriguing history of the San Gorgonio Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Barton Flats Visitors Center is about six miles east of Angeles Oaks on 
California 38. For further information, call (714) 794-1123 today from 6:30 
a.m. to 3 p.m. or Sunday and Monday from 8 a.m. to noon. JOHN McKINNEY

PARK SERVICE BACKS OFF ON BANNING CARS IN YOSEMITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yosemite Valley, the picturesque gash in the granite walls and domes of 
Yosemite National Park visited by more than 2 million people a year, will not 
be closed off to cars anytime soon, the National Park Service finally conceded 
Friday after nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pledges of a quieter, more peaceful Yosemite made in a 1980 master 
plan, park officials said in a new report that it will not be feasible before 
sometime next century -- if ever -- to ban private cars from the narrow, 
4,000-foot elevation valley. 
</P>
<P>
And besides, the report says, conservation groups may wish for a less motorized 
environment in the valley but most visitors don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people prefer the convenience and scheduling flexibility offered by a 
private automobile," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation groups that poured years of work into the 1980 master plan -- 
which also contained vows to cut overnight accommodations and remove most 
buildings from the valley -- had grown skeptical over the years that the more 
revolutionary changes would ever take place. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the report Friday was called a serious blow. "It appears to me they 
are not dedicated to the goals of the master plan," said Patricia Schifferle, 
regional director in San Francisco of the Wilderness Society, one of the groups 
that hailed the 1980 plan. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1980 plan, the National Park Service proclaimed as its vision making 
Yosemite Valley, the most visited area of the park, "less congested, less 
developed and more attuned to the uncluttered, inspirational natural beauty and 
rhythms that visitors anticipate." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the provisions -- including a drastic cut in auto use -- were to be in 
place by next year, the 100th anniversary of the national park northeast of 
Fresno in a patch of the Sierra Nevada range carved by glaciers into 
splendorous rock formations. 
</P>
<P>
But, said acting Supt. B.J. Griffin Friday, "It was just too ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,500 Workers 
</P>
<P>
At times in summer, Yosemite Valley takes on the look of a small city. Nearly 
1,500 workers live on the valley floor and walk paths with views of the park's 
famous cliffs and waterfalls. The local Lion's Club meets for lunch twice a 
month at the Ahwahnee Hotel, the Rotary every Tuesday at Yosemite Lodge. There 
are regular sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, and a 
dentist who sees patients five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The valley environment has turned somewhat more natural in recent years, the 
report said. There is less dust, litter and smoke; the east end of the valley 
has been closed to cars; about 18% of overnight visitors come in tour buses 
rather than cars, and more people are riding shuttle buses after they arrive, 
the Park Service said. 
</P>
<P>
But requiring visitors to park their cars at distant lots and ride buses or 
some other form of transit into the valley, as suggested by the 1980 plan, is 
not realistic in the foreseeable future, the report said. It would cost too 
much and there are problems of logistics. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the report calculates that buses would have to depart every 
minute from satellite parking lots to accommodate the park's current 3.3 
million annual visitors. The slow-climbing buses would add to congestion on 
Highway 140, the "middle route" into the park from Mariposa. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the narrow road would need to be widened by cantilevering the 
pavement over the Merced River canyon. "The financial cost and environmental 
impact would be major," the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the report said, lessening the impact of traffic may be a long way 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Future technologies may help us reach a more sweeping solution of the private 
automobile dilemma," the report says. "Perhaps a light-rail system, operated by 
21st-Century technologies such as electromagnetic conduction, could make it 
physically and economically feasible" to virtually ban cars from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reducing Overnight Stays 
</P>
<P>
Another major goal of the 1980 plan was to reduce by 17% the number of people 
who could stay overnight in the valley. Some were to be accommodated by new 
lodging in the Wawona and White Wolf sections of the park, though the plan 
foresaw forcing about 10% to leave the park altogether. 
</P>
<P>
But the valley has remained steady at about 1,770 sleeping accommodations, 
ranging in price and comfort from the rustic clubbiness of the Ahwahnee Hotel 
to tent cabins -- pieces of canvas slung over a wood frame under the fir trees. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing demand to sleep in the park has forced park officials to decide not 
to immediately take lodging units out of service, and lack of water has made it 
impossible to build new units at Wawona, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Costs have also gotten in the way of plans to relocate workers -- most of them 
employees of Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., a private firm that runs lodgings 
and restaurants -- and the park's administrative headquarters to the El Portal

<P>
Nine veteran members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics 
bureau were relieved of duty Friday while federal and county investigators 
pursue allegations that the deputies misappropriated tens of thousands of 
dollars confiscated in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block, appearing saddened and subdued at an afternoon press 
conference, said the members of an entire departmental narcotics investigation 
unit -- a sergeant and eight deputies -- had been temporarily relieved of 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Embarrassment' 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret that I have to tell you," the sheriff said, "that corruption 
has apparently touched members of my department and caused great embarrassment 
to all of us who wear a badge." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of how long the investigation is expected to 
take, but one federal law enforcement official said that arrests in the case 
could begin as early as next week. FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents, 
acting with search warrants, removed evidence from the home of at least one of 
the deputies late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement source said that while some details remain sketchy, 
it appears that more than $200,000 might have been taken. There was no 
indication that narcotics were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not nickel and dime," the source said. "We don't know the full amount of 
money at this time. It could run into a couple of hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"The money was not getting to the evidence vault. I think they took a little 
each time rather than a major amount." 
</P>
<P>
Block refused to divulge many details of the allegations against the narcotics 
officers, all of whom worked in a unit that targeted only major narcotics 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff did indicate the possibility that not all of the deputies were 
responsible for the missing cash. But, Block said, "since these people work as 
a team, the entire team has been placed on administrative leave." 
</P>
<P>
The nine officers worked out of the Sheriff Department's narcotics bureau 
headquartered in Whittier and handled investigations throughout the county, 
according to department officials. Block said some of the officers had worked 
together for several years and others for a shorter period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Block said the investigation began last October when an internal audit showed 
what appeared to be a misappropriation of funds handled by the narcotics unit. 
The FBI was brought in on the case in May, and the IRS joined in July. No 
criminal charges have been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The eight deputies and the sergeant were placed on administrative leave, which 
will allow them to keep their guns and badges and receive pay while not 
performing any duties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Major Scandal 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff declined to disclose the amount of money that the accused deputies 
allegedly misappropriated. He acknowledged, though, that narcotics officers in 
major cases "do come in contact with significant amounts of money." 
</P>
<P>
Block expressed concern about the reputation of the county law enforcement 
agency. He said the corruption case "may turn out to be" the biggest scandal of 
his seven-year tenure as chief officer of the 10,700-member department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time anything of this magnitude has been suspected in this 
department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A top sheriff's official, who was not involved in the carefully cloaked 
internal investigation, said the announcement Friday came as a "total shock" 
within the department, which has suffered through a series of image-tarnishing 
incidents this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are devastated," said the official, who asked to remain anonymous. "This is 
a terrible day for us. We are talking about people with excellent reputations. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a 'majors crew' working on major traffickers exclusively. . . . They 
have been around a long time . . . . The question is whether it goes beyond 
this unit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine officers involved were identified as Robert Sobel, a sergeant with 19 
years' service, and Deputies Terrell H. Amers, 22 years; James R. Bauder, nine 
years; Nancy A. Brown, 17 years; Eufrasio G. Cortez, 14 years; Ronald E. Daub, 
16 years; John C. Dickenson, 10 years; Daniel R. Garner, 18 years, and Michael 
J. Kaliterna, 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senior Personnel 
</P>
<P>
Block described the nine as "some of our senior narcotics investigators," 
</P>
<P>
He said: "I wouldn't say the most elite, but certainly as evidenced by their 
years of service, there are some senior members of the department." 
</P>
<P>
All day Friday and after dusk, federal agents were busy inside and outside 
Bauder's home in Palmdale. Neighbors said agents wearing jackets with FBI 
emblems had accompanied other officers inside the home and had removed items. 
One of the agents said they were serving a search warrant at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Standing outside his house at about 7 p.m. after the federal agents had gone, 
Bauder, who said he had served for the last two years with the major narcotics 
team, denied the theft allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no knowledge of any theft," he said. "I have never seen it, and I never 
participated in it. . . . I was confronted with some allegations, but it is all 
news to me." 
</P>
<P>
Bauder, his wife and two children recently moved from a nearby house where they 
had lived for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
"They are real nice people," said one neighbor, Marguerette Surur. "I'm still 
shocked, and I don't believe it. I hope it's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the deputies named Friday, Dickenson, was awarded the Sheriff's 
Department's highest award, the Medal of Valor, in March, 1988, for his 
participation in a drug raid. Dickenson was wounded and a fellow deputy was 
fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Block insisted that narcotics investigations will not be crippled by 
the probe. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "it certainly will be impacted because of the trauma of this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Block was flanked at the press conference by Lawrence Lawler, special agent in 
charge of the Los Angeles FBI office, and Earl J. Acquaviva, chief of the 
criminal investigation division of the Los Angeles IRS office. 
</P>
<P>
The missing money was seized in drug investigations and never reached the 
evidence locker, Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to investigate it hand-in-glove with the Sheriff's Department and 
the Internal Revenue Service," Lawler said. "We're not done with it yet, so we 
don't have a handle on how much money is involved." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess said his office is also involved in the investigation. 
He said the department encouraged the probe by outside law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was brought to us by the Sheriff's Department," Feess said. "From the 
beginning, they've been interested that the case be thoroughly and completely 
investigated." 
</P>
<P>
The suspensions of the deputies came as federal prosecutors are preparing a 
major corruption case against Darnell Garcia, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent based in Los Angeles. Garcia was arrested in Luxembourg 
last July after a seven-month manhunt spearheaded by the DEA. Garcia, along 
with two other former agents, was accused in a 36-count indictment of 
conspiring to set up a drug network and laundering profits from the operation 
through several banks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say that roughly 40% of the cocaine now entering the United 
States is being shipped into the Los Angeles area, putting hundreds of millions 
of illicit dollars into circulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department seized about $34 million in drug money and 6,000 
pounds of cocaine in 1988. The seizures represented sharp increases over 1987, 
sheriff's officials said. During the same period, the Los Angeles Police 
Department seized $35 million in drug-related money and 10,500 pounds of 
cocaine. The figures were slight increases over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Block vowed to eliminate corruption in the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate defections by those entrusted to defend us," he said. "Any 
hint of corruption in this department will be vigorously investigated, and 
those involved in corrupt conduct prosecuted to the full extent of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the Sheriff's Department has been dogged by bad publicity 
involving some of its deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In February, sheriff's narcotics Detective Rickey Ross was arrested by Los 
Angeles police officers after he was found sitting in a parked car with a 
prostitute. Accused of murdering three other women, Ross spent three months in 
jail before being released when prosecutors found that ballistics tests 
performed on his gun had erroneously linked him to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ross was fired because he allegedly had been smoking cocaine with 
the prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a former deputy, Eugene A Harris, filed a suit alleging that the 
department tolerated "neo-Nazi-like" and "Ku-Klux-Klan-style" activities inside 
the Central Men's Jail in a pattern of discrimination against black inmates and 
deputies alike. The FBI has been investigating allegations of racially 
motivated misconduct at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Deputy George Thomas Markel -- a lightning rod for complaints since 
he joined the department in 1978 -- was arrested on suspicion of robbing a 
prominent Miami attorney. In earlier complaints against him, Markel allegedly 
used unnecessary force to subdue a civilian and used "fear and intimidation" to 
get another deputy to help him claim unearned overtime.

RACIAL TENSION HAUNTS A 'NICE NEIGHBORHOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID TREADWELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a neighborhood of small shops, corner delis and tidy houses and apartment 
buildings with statues of saints adorning front-yard gardens. 
</P>
<P>
On summer evenings, families lounge in aluminum lawn chairs and chat merrily 
with their neighbors, many speaking in their native Italian, as kids play 
freely in the quiet streets. 
</P>
<P>
But this is also where a gang of white teen-agers, armed with baseball bats and 
at least one gun, shot to death a black youth who had come to the neighborhood 
with three companions to see about buying a used car, heightening racial 
tensions here to their worst level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Like many ethnic enclaves in northern cities, Bensonhurst, a largely 
Italian-American community of 152,700 residents on Brooklyn's southern shore, 
has rarely, if ever, been noted for being hospitable to "outsiders" -- 
especially blacks and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, as the nation sifted the ashes of successive urban riots, 
academics and many government officials hoped that education and greater 
integration would break down intolerance in such communities. Instead, the 
situation may have worsened. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City , for example, there has been an alarming string of violent 
racial incidents in working class, white ethnic neighborhoods in recent years, 
including the widely publicized death in 1986 of a black man who was hit by a 
car while fleeing a gang of whites in the Howard Beach section of Queens and 
the brutal killing in 1982 of a black man by whites in the Gravesend 
neighborhood of Brooklyn, near Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of a protest march today through Bensonhurst to be led by black 
activists, attitudes are hard. 
</P>
<P>
"The violence to which blacks have been subjected in New York City surpasses 
the violence of the Southern cities of my youth," Herbert Daughtry, pastor of 
Brooklyn's House of the Lord Pentecostal Church, said in a recent opinion piece 
published in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nice Neighborhood' 
</P>
<P>
In Bensonhurst, one 59-year-old resident said Wednesday: "It's a nice 
neighborhood -- just like any other place in the United States -- but we don't 
care for black people." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, residents almost universally reject suggestions by outsiders that 
racism is a problem in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Many argue that last week's slaying of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins was a case of 
jealously and mistaken identity more than racism. According to various 
accounts, the gang of young whites thought Hawkins and his companions were 
friends of a white Bensonhurst girl whose spurned lover had warned her not to 
invite blacks and Latinos into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing never happens," said Frank Adamo, 32, a newsstand owner, 
referring to the killing. "This is a neighborhood where whites get along with 
blacks. We all get along." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, just two years ago on Christmas Day, two blacks were beaten by a gang of 
whites in Bensonhurst who allegedly yelled: "This is our Howard Beach!" And in 
1983, whites assaulted three black men on their way home through the 
neighborhood to their jobs at a Coney Island hospital. None of the injuries in 
either incident was fatal. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, when a group of largely black protesters staged a demonstration 
last weekend at the site where Hawkins was slain, several white 
counterdemonstrators held up watermelons and shouted an epithet. 
</P>
<P>
"They shout (the epithet) and then tell everybody they're not racist," said 
Richard Wade, a professor of urban history at City University of New York's 
Graduate Center. "They don't even know they're racist. That's the trouble. They 
don't know what racism is." 
</P>
<P>
Bensonhurst's latest black victim has even been blamed for precipitating the 
crime. As one young white put it, referring to Hawkins: "Look, he was black. 
What was he doing in a white neighborhood at 9:30 at night?" 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Charles Fermiglia, the 30-year-old associate pastor of St. Dominic's 
Roman Catholic Church in Bensonhurst, said that racial attitudes in the 
community are strongly conditioned by the constant barrage of negative 
portrayals of blacks in the mass media -- newspapers, radio, television and 
movies -- and the relative scarcity of any countervailing images. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Bensonhurst's Italian-American population is made up of 
immigrants from Italy, many from the strongly traditional regions of southern 
Italy and Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italian-American transplanted to this community wants to live in a 
neighborhood with familiars, people who share his values of family and 
community and can give him meaning," Fermiglia said. "The perceptions of blacks 
gained through the media, unfortunately, is that they are socially 
disconnected." 
</P>
<P>
General attitudes in society are magnified in places like Bensonhurst, said 
Charles Willie, a Harvard University professor of education and urban studies. 
</P>
<P>
"These neighborhoods are acting out the values which they have heard 
articulated not just by other working-class people but by middle-class people 
and others" on up the socioeconomic ladder, he said. "The people in Bensonhurst 
hear the more affluent white opinion-molders talk against the encroachment . . 
. that blacks and Hispanics are making, and they feel they are doing the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Recourse 
</P>
<P>
If their actions more often take a violent turn than those by whites in more 
affluent settings -- such as the suburban communities or college campuses that 
also have experienced a rash of racial incidents in recent years -- it usually 
is because blue-collar whites feel that they have less recourse to 
institutional systems to protect their interests, Willie said. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast's sharp decline in manufacturing jobs -- the traditional 
occupational mainstay of urban, white ethnic communities -- together with the 
ever increasing proportions of blacks, Latinos and Asians in city populations, 
has given many of these neighborhoods the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that 
their backs are against the wall, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the simplest terms, what happens in a place like Bensonhurst is the people 
who can make it, leave, while those who can't, stay behind," he said. "Those 
involved in these racial incidents are people with marginal jobs or no jobs at 
all, who haven't finished high school and only occasionally go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"You have these pockets all over where you have left behind a class of whites 
who may have already moved two or three times as a result of the expanding 
ghetto. And now, there's no place to go. As one person in Bensonhurst was 
quoted as saying in the paper: 'They keep pushing so, there's no place to go 
but the water.' " 
</P>
<P>
The association of blacks with high crime rates is another obstacle to greater 
acceptance and tolerance, Fermiglia, the priest, said. 
</P>
<P>
Bensonhurst has one of the lowest crime rates in Brooklyn. For example, only 13 
murders and 15 forcible rapes were reported in the community in 1988. That 
compares to 64 murders and 117 rapes in the predominantly black Brownsville 
neighborhood, which has a population half that of Bensonhurst, and 128 murders 
and 253 rapes in the largely black Bedford-Stuyvesant community, which has a 
population of 133,800 -- 18,900 less than Bensonhurst's. 
</P>
<P>
Fermiglia acknowledged that Bensonhurst's residents look merely at such 
statistics and do not take into account the much greater unemployment and other 
economic and social factors that may be behind the higher crime rates in the 
black sections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old South 
</P>
<P>
He also decries comparisons of Bensonhurst with the South of the Jim Crow era, 
saying that unlike Dixie during that period, the public officials and civic and 
religious leaders of the Brooklyn community do not condone or publicly support 
racism and segregation. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Bensonhurst has become home to a small but growing number of 
Asians and Latinos -- chiefly Puerto Ricans -- who appear to be relatively well 
accepted in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here for two years and I haven't encountered any prejudice. Well, 
just a little bit," said Hae Soo Jeon, proprietor of Yang's Grocery-Deli on one 
of Bensonhurst's bustling commercial strips. "I didn't even know this was 
Bensonhurst until the murder happened. I thought I was in a place called Bay 
Ridge." 
</P>
<P>
A smattering of blacks are said to live in Bensonhurst as well, and many blacks 
work in the local shops and businesses, although usually in menial jobs, and at 
the local post office. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the blacks who work here say they have had their share of bad 
encounters and don't hang around the neighborhood after work, others say their 
experiences have been virtually problem-free. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked here for two years and never had any trouble," said Trevor Fuller, 
32, who lives in Flatbush and is a delivery man for a monthly Bensonhurst 
newspaper. "I don't hang around after work, but if I did, they wouldn't bother 
me. Everybody knows (me). Besides, my brother-in-law is Italian." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as a white political worker familiar with New York's blue-collar, 
white ethnic enclaves says: "Brooklyn and Queens are extremely racist, no 
matter what anybody tells you. I think it comes from the fact that the majority 
of whites grow up in segregated neighborhoods, go to parochial schools and have 
no exposure to minority people of any color, and there's just an incredible 
fear of them. In a large part, it's a fear of the unknown, which seems kind of 
crazy in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
How to overcome these fears and create greater racial tolerance and harmony in 
communities like Bensonhurst remains a big question. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, the working class and the poor are paying the price of the 
unwillingness of the society to solve the economic and social problems" that 
help feed racial hatreds and animosities, said Richard Simpson, a former 
Chicago alderman who is now a political science professor at the University of 
Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that the North Side Chicago ward that he once represented boasted 
a multiethnic and multiracial population that managed to live without the 
strife normally associated with such neighborhoods because "most people were 
moving up in society and weren't threatened by sliding down." 
</P>
<P>
What is more, "we weren't threatened by a Cabrini-Green next door," he said, 
referring to a deteriorating, crime-ridden Chicago high-rise public housing 
project near the downtown Loop business district. 
</P>
<P>
"We could even introduce three public housing projects of our own without only 
a little flak," he said. "They were the low-rise kind with only 18 units in 
each of the three buildings, but if you tried that on the northwest or 
southwest sides, there would be some serious threats or even firebombs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stance by Leaders 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also contends that a lot could be achieved if public officials and 
community leaders took an open stance against racism and encouraged programs 
and policies that promoted greater racial understanding and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
In Bensonhurst, tentative steps have already been made in that direction. The 
Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, and the superintendent of Community 
School District 20 in Bensonhurst, promised at a recent news conference to 
expand the human relations curriculum in the district classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
How much further this kind of activity will go and whether it will help create 
a better racial climate remains to be seen. But as Elizabeth Galarza, the 
32-year-old Bensonhurst mother of four who held the dying Yusuf Hawkins' hand 
after he was shot and murmured words of encouragement to him, said: "There are 
more of us who believe in a positive way and that's the way we should all go in 
this neighborhood."

BASEBALL CZAR GIAMATTI DIES OF HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A. Bartlett Giamatti, the seventh commissioner of professional baseball and a 
former president of Yale University, died of an apparent heart attack Friday. 
He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti was stricken in mid-afternoon at his vacation home in Edgartown, 
Mass., on Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
State police responded to a call from a family member and found Giamatti 
unconscious and in full cardiac arrest, officer Byron Rizos said. 
</P>
<P>
"CPR was initiated but there was no response," Rizos said. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti was taken by ambulance to Martha's Vineyard Hospital where he was 
pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m., "after all-out efforts to resuscitate him 
failed," Matthew Stackpole, the hospital's director of development, said. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, a chain smoker who once said that cigarettes were his primary vice 
and who resisted the efforts of a number of baseball owners who tried to get 
him to quit smoking, had left New York Friday morning to spend the Labor Day 
weekend on the popular vacation island. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped him off at noon on Martha's Vineyard and he seemed fine," deputy 
commissioner Francis T. Vincent Jr., who traveled to New England with Giamatti, 
said. "This is a tremendous shock. He was a uniquely talented man who had great 
friends and admirers. It's a serious loss for the country, the sport and his 
family." Giamatti was an authority on Renaissance literature and a man who 
could discuss Dante and the infield fly rule with equal ease. He spent two 
years as National League president before being elected to a five-year term as 
commissioner in a unanimous vote of the 26 owners Sept. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded Peter V. Ueberroth on April 1 of this year. He is the first 
commissioner to die in office since Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who died 
Nov. 25, 1944.

Like Giamatti, Landis made his mark with a lifetime ban, against Shoeless Joe 
Jackson and seven other members of the infamous Chicago Black Sox who were 
accused of taking money from a gambler to throw the 1919 World Series.

Ueberroth Comments 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finest commissioner in 
history," Ueberroth, vacationing in Paris, said in a statement released through 
his Newport, Calif., office. "Bart Giamatti encompassed everything that is good 
and enduring about America's favorite pastime. For this man of words, courage 
and deeds . . . no words can express the loss." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's five-month tenure was three years shorter than any of his six 
predecessors and was dominated by the investigation into the alleged gambling 
activities of Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose, who received a lifetime 
suspension from Giamatti nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Robert A. Pitcairn Jr., in a statement issued Friday on Rose's behalf, 
said Rose was "deeply saddened" by the news of Giamatti's death. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of their dispute, Pete had great personal respect for the 
commissioner. He extends his deepest sympathy to Commissioner Giamatti's 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, before agreeing to the terms of his suspension, contended that Giamatti 
had pre-judged his case and sought an injunction that would have prevented 
Giamatti from ruling on it. The long dispute was believed to have created 
stress for Giamatti, but he denied that in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"While it's a serious matter, it doesn't take up that much of my time," he 
said. "Most of my time, 80 to 90% of it, is spent on other things. The way it's 
been played (by the media) would make you think that I've been sitting here all 
day worrying about it, but that hasn't been the case for months." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Me., said Giamatti "in a short 
time made a real contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible 
ethical standards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spoke With Giamatti 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had talked with the commissioner, a fellow Yale alumnus, "at great 
length" about the Rose case and just missed a call from him at Kennebunkport a 
few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti was trying to contact the President, Bush said, because "I told him 
I'd like to, just as a baseball fan, know the aftermath, know exactly how this 
matter had been resolved. But all through that I was thinking of the difficulty 
that he had in setting these standards that high and staying with it." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's rules provide for the Executive Council, comprised of the two league 
presidents and eight club owners, to carry out the commissioner's duties until 
a successor is chosen. An owners' meeting, previously scheduled for Milwaukee 
Sept. 13-14, will now focus on that objective, a spokesman for the 
commissioner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those likely to receive consideration, baseball sources said, are 
American League president Bobby Brown, National League president Bill White, 
Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, New York Mets president Frank Cashen and 
deputy commissioner Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's position was created in a reorganization of the commissioner's office 
by Giamatti. He becomes interim commissioner until a successor is named. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, a longtime friend of Giamatti's, is an attorney who formerly was 
chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., as 
well as senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Company and president and chief 
executive officer of Coca-Cola's entertainment business section. He served as a 
liaison to Giamatti on the Rose case and heads the commissioner's corporate, 
licensing and broadcasting divisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Ties to Boston 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Bartlett Giamatti was born in Boston on April 4, 1938. His father, 
Valentine, was a literature professor at Mt. Holyoke College and an avid Red 
Sox fan, Giamatti recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably 7 or 8 years old when my father and uncle took me to my first 
baseball game," he said. "I'd been listening on the radio often enough, but 
going to Fenway Park, I just was astonished at the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The memory and the loyalty stayed with him. He often wore a Red Sox cap and 
carried a transistor to listen to the team's games while serving as Yale 
president. He grew up with the romantic's view that baseball is best played on 
grass in the afternoon, but he lacked the talent to play it himself and 
gravitated to literature like his father. 
</P>
<P>
He received a bachelor of arts degree in English from Yale in 1960 and a Ph.D. 
in comparative literature in 1964. He taught Italian and comparative literature 
at Princeton before returning to Yale in 1966. He became a full professor there 
at 33 and director of the Division of Humanities at 37. 
</P>
<P>
He was elected president of the university in 1978 -- the youngest in two 
centuries -- and served for nine years, providing Yale with its first balanced 
budget in a decade and ultimately healing the wounds of his hardline stance in 
the face of a 1984 strike by clerical and technical workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave of himself magnificently as a teacher, scholar and leader," Benno C. 
Schmidt Jr., Giamatti's successor at Yale, said Friday. "This university will 
be a better place because of his service. He will never be forgotten here." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a number of books, essays and articles on Renaissance literature, but 
he also wrote about baseball, which attracted the attention of the game's 
owners and executives. He became the 12th president of the National League on 
Dec. 11, 1986, and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Dante would have been delighted." 
</P>
<P>
He added at the time that "people of letters have always gravitated to sport" 
and that he had long found baseball to be "the most satisfying and nourishing 
of games -- outside of literature, of course." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Schools of Thought 
</P>
<P>
Asked what his colleagues at Yale thought about his decision to become a 
baseball executive, Giamatti laughed and said: "One group thought it was nifty. 
The other thought it was the ultimate proof of my essential unsoundness." 
</P>
<P>
In a sport that holds the lexicon of the clubhouse sacred, Giamatti displayed 
wit, literacy and a youth's affection for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The prism through which I see things is the prism that understands baseball is 
an enormously important American institution with long and deep roots whose 
purpose is to provide pleasure and fun for the American people, and whose 
integrity and authenticity are essential in order to provide that pleasure," he 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace of the game allows for rumination even at the moment instead of just 
in retrospect," he added. "And it is a game with a history and mythology so 
intimately connected to America that in some idealized and mythological sense 
it is virtually synonymous with America."

DIOXIN DETECTED IN MILK, FDA SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRY ACTING TO REDUCE CARCINOGEN IN PAPER CARTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration confirmed Friday that it has detected low 
levels of dioxin in milk, attributing the presence of the highly toxic 
substance to the process used to manufacture paper milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA and the American Paper Institute, which represents the paper industry, 
said that the nation's major paper mills are changing their manufacturing 
techniques to further reduce dioxin to levels that would be virtually 
undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
"During the short period of time it will take to complete corrective steps, 
milk is safe to drink," FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in a statement. 
"But, because we have the means to virtually eliminate even this low level of 
dioxin, it is prudent to do so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accumulates in Fat 
</P>
<P>
Dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical that can cause cancer and birth defects, 
accumulates in the body's fatty tissues and is not excreted. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the chemical, present in four of 15 half-pint milk samples 
tested, was found at levels ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 of a part per trillion. 
The FDA acknowledged that its testing methods were not sophisticated enough to 
detect lower levels of dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA estimated that the lifetime cancer risk of consuming affected milk over 
the next three to five years would be less than one in a million, "even if the 
paper industry were unable to reduce levels during this period." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists insist that even low levels of dioxin can pose a peril, 
particularly to children. The half-pint paper carton is commonly used to 
provide milk to children in school lunch programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Any level of dioxin is quite dangerous to human health," said Mark Floegel, a 
spokesman for Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
"All summer long, school boards have been making decisions to buy milk in 
bleached paper cartons for children to drink," he said. "It's absolutely 
unacceptable for children, who are growing, to be exposed to a compound such as 
dioxin in their schools." 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace petitioned the Department of Agriculture last February to ban the 
use of such cartons. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
health subcommittee, said that he was "extremely concerned" by the findings and 
would hold a congressional hearing on the subject Friday. Waxman had requested 
the FDA report last December. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, said that 75% of 
current carton production is made with a new process that reduces the amount of 
chlorine used but does not eliminate it. Chlorine is the source of the dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
Cavaney estimated that all of the country's paper mills would be using the new 
procedure within a year. Further, he said, few cartons from the old process 
will remain in the marketing pipeline, because the shelf life of milk is short. 
</P>
<P>
"Dioxin is an unwanted byproduct," he said. "We didn't know it was there. As 
soon as we discovered its potential presence in our products, we set out to see 
if we could reduce, if not eliminate it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Cartons for 2 Weeks 
</P>
<P>
The FDA studied whole milk that had been refrigerated in half-pint containers 
for two weeks before testing. The milk came from cartons containing paperboard 
made by all five companies producing such packaging in the United States, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government is under a court order to produce a plan for dealing 
with dioxin in the environment by next April. 
</P>
<P>
Similar findings of dioxin in milk were found in studies conducted last year in 
Canada and New Zealand.

Medicare will pay for routine mammography tests to detect breast cancer 
beginning Jan. 1, under a regulation the government proposed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized Medicare coverage of mammography examinations last year, 
making an exception to the law that prohibits Medicare payments for routine 
physical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
One of every 10 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetimes, medical 
experts say, and elderly women have the highest risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Early detection of breast cancer is essential for effective treatment, and 
Medicare coverage will encourage more older women to obtain mammography 
screening on a regular basis," said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Health 
and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation, drafted by HHS, was published in Friday's Federal Register. 
After 60 days of public comment, a final regulation will be drafted.

EPA TO PHASE OUT ALAR USE IN APPLES BY JUNE, 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday that it will phase down 
permissible levels of Alar in apple products over the next two years, with a 
ban on the pesticide taking effect in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it wanted to discourage further use of the plant growth regulator 
by farmers, but that it did not want to move so quickly that crops treated with 
Alar earlier this year would have to be removed from the market. 
</P>
<P>
Under the EPA's proposed phase-out schedule, the current 20 parts per million 
federal limit on Alar residues in apples and processed apple products would be 
reduced to five parts per million on Nov. 30, 1989. The limit would be lowered 
to 1 part per million in November, 1990, and any detectable level would be 
illegal after May 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it set its schedule on the assumption that apples harvested 
this fall would be available for another year at most and that apple juice and 
sauce made from apples grown in 1989 would be out of the food system by the 
spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it was not necessary to immediately seize Alar-treated food 
because studies showed that consumers faced no significant short-term health 
risk from the pesticide, which is used on apples and other fruit to enhance 
color, firmness and shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency said it had new scientific data confirming its initial findings 
that Alar poses an unacceptably high risk of cancer if regularly consumed over 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA began a special review of Alar in 1984 due to cancer concerns, but the 
agency took no action until earlier this year when an environmental group 
released a study charging that children were at special risk from the 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials challenged the findings of the Natural Resources Defense Council 
study as overblown, but agreed that Alar posed unacceptable risks. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it also was revoking approval for use of Alar on cherries, 
nectarines, peaches, pears, peanuts, grapes, tomato transplants and ornamental 
plants.

BUSH MEETS NEW JAPANESE PREMIER; TRADE ISSUE SKIRTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With two simple expressions -- "comfortable" and "first name" -- President Bush 
on Friday offered Japan's new prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, a gift of 
legitimacy likely to lift Kaifu's status in the eyes of his countrymen and 
bolster his troubled Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu met Bush at the White House little more than three weeks after taking 
office amid political turmoil caused by scandals and electoral setbacks at 
home, and he got what he appeared to be after. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders largely skirted the thorny matters of trade friction, as 
expected, and Bush welcomed the prime minister by saying he immediately felt 
"comfortable" in his presence and proposed that they get to know each other on 
a "first-name basis." 
</P>
<P>
Such gestures of intimacy are loaded with meaning for Japanese leaders. Former 
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone greatly enhanced his stature as a statesman by 
establishing a "Ron and Yasu" relationship with former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, who appears to be crafting an image patterned after the popular 
Nakasone, rushed to the United States to prepare for the task of leading the 
ruling conservatives through a crucial election in the lower house of 
Parliament. The vote could come as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the warm expressions of support, Kaifu received a warning from Bush and 
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Unless Japan shows significant 
progress by next spring in wide-ranging economic and trade talks slated to 
begin on Monday, Kaifu was told, the Administration will face pressures from 
Congress that it may find difficult to resist. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, conducted as part of a Structural Impediments Initiative between the 
U.S. and Japan, will allow each nation to point out problems in each other's 
economy that contribute to an intractable $55-billion trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has also come for Japan to become an import superpower," Bush told 
Kaifu during a departure ceremony at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that even though Kaifu made no commitments on trade and 
economic issues, he was "verbally cooperative," pledging to take the new talks 
seriously and push for some sort of solution to the problems under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Kaifu declared his opposition to the threat of trade sanctions 
implicit in the so-called Super 301 trade negotiations scheduled to begin later 
this month in Hawaii. . The talks are named after a section of last year's 
Omnibus Trade Act, which allows the President to retaliate against countries 
engaged in unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has cited Japan under Section 301 for trade practices 
involving super-computers, satellites and forest products. Kaifu told Bush that 
sanctions would have an "intense impact" on the Japanese public, according to 
Foreign Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the encounter was far from confrontational. The major theme of 
the summit, which brought Bush back to Washington for a day from his Maine 
vacation, was the pledge to continue close cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu became Japan's prime minister after his two predecessors were forced to 
resign. Noboru Takeshita stepped down in connection with an influence-peddling 
scandal, and Sosuke Uno left office following revelations of a money-for-sex 
scandal and the ruling party's humiliating defeat in the July 23 election for 
the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the Liberal Democratic Party took control of the 
government 34 years ago, it stands a chance of losing power to the Japan 
Socialist Party, which is headed by a charismatic woman, Takako Doi. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic political uncertainty has effectively paralyzed the Liberal Democrats, 
a source close to the prime minister said, making it all but impossible for 
Japan's leadership to make policy decisions about trade or international 
affairs until they regain the public's mandate in the lower house election. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have done little to conceal their hopes that the Liberal 
Democratic Party will be able to win the election. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is known to be worried for two reasons about the possibility 
the Socialists might come to power. 
</P>
<P>
One is that a Socialist-led government under Doi would call into question 
Japan's defense and security ties with the United States and might prove to be 
more protectionist on trade issues than the Liberal Democrats 
</P>
<P>
Another is the Administration's desire for continuity. Although the Socialists 
have indicated they are prepared to move away from their policy of advocating 
unarmed neutrality and immediate abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, 
the Administration would prefer to avoid any unsettling change in the 
relationship between the United States and Japan.

GERMANS ALONE BEAR BLAME FOR WAR: KOHL; 
</P>
<P>
BUT BONN OFFICIALS DIFFER ON HOW TO RECONCILE WITH POLAND; E. BERLIN REJECTS 
REUNITING NATION

<TEXT>
<P>
West German officials Friday marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World 
War II by acknowledging that Germans bear full responsibility for the cataclysm 
that cost more than 50 million lives. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an East German official praised the Soviet Union for 
resisting Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler during the war and warned the Bonn 
government not to attempt to reunite the nation, which was partitioned in the 
war's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
West German leaders paid particular tribute to Poland, Nazi Germany's first 
victim of the war, but appeared to differ over how to reconcile the two 
countries. Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, began World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special nationally televised session of the Parliament, West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared that "Hitler wanted, planned and 
unleashed the war, (which) reached a dimension of horror that had never been 
seen before and must never be seen again." 
</P>
<P>
Seated in the audience were the Polish ambassador to West Germany and a group 
of Polish young people. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl called for reconciliation between West Germans and Poles. He said: 
"Terrible things were done to the Polish people in the name of Germany and by 
German hands. The wounds the Second World War opened have not healed even 
today." 
</P>
<P>
But differences in how to go about healing those wounds surfaced in Friday's 
speech-making by other West German leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boundary Disagreement 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats called on the government to reassure the Poles 
that West Germany has no claims on prewar territory that was given to Poland 
after the war. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing members of Kohl's governing coalition, among them Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel, have insisted that until a permanent peace treaty is signed, 
Germany's legal boundaries are those of 1937. This area includes much of what 
is now western Poland. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kohl skirted the issue by supporting the 1970 Warsaw Treaty that 
recognizes the postwar boundaries. But he did not specifically reject all 
claims to prewar German territory. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Willy Brandt criticized the government on the Polish issue by 
accusing right-wing officials of interfering with anniversary trips that Kohl 
and President Richard von Weizsaecker had planned to take this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The trips were not made, partly because Bonn and Warsaw could not agree on the 
amount and specifics of an economic support package for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, a former leader of the Social Democratic Party, who spent the war in 
exile in Sweden, said: "Unfortunately, the fatal impression arose this summer 
that the road to Warsaw was shorter from London, Paris and even Washington than 
from Bonn." This was a reference to Polish visits by British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kohl took note of the debt to Jews who perished in the 
Holocaust. He said West Germany's improved relations with Israel and with Jews 
around the world indicate that "bridges can be built over an abyss." 
</P>
<P>
"Most countries of Europe suffered heavily at Germany's hand," Kohl said. "Many 
of them are now our partners, even our friends." 
</P>
<P>
In a remark apparently addressed to the political far right, Kohl, who was 9 
years old when the war began, paid tribute to Germans who fought in the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them," he said, "were honestly convinced that they were serving their 
country loyally. There were countless examples of bravery and humanity that 
deserve respect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Crisis 
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the current crisis over East Germans trying to emigrate to 
the West. But in East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer told the East 
German Parliament that the Bonn government "must take leave of its baseless 
presumption of the right to represent all Germans and to exercise guardianship

W. GERMANY INDICTS FORMER GI FOR TREASON AS EAST BLOC SPY

A former U.S. Army sergeant, arrested last year, has been charged with treason 
for allegedly running an international spy ring that sold NATO secrets to East 
Bloc agents, the federal prosecutor's office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The case of former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad marks the first 
time that a foreign citizen living in West Germany has been charged with 
treason, according to Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the federal 
prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Foerster said Conrad could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. A trial 
date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
The American was arrested Aug. 23, 1988, on suspicion of heading a West 
German-based spy ring involving seven other people with contacts in Sweden and 
Austria. It took a year to formally charge him, apparently because of the 
complexity of the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said the Aug. 14 
indictment charges that Conrad provided classified documents, including 
material on "nuclear operations," to Hungarian military intelligence, starting 
in 1975, and the Czechoslovak intelligence service, from 1981 to 1986.. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, 42, a native of Sebring, Ohio, received at least $1.1 million for his 
work as a spy, the statement said. He has lived in West Germany since retiring 
in September, 1985, after 20 years in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the time from 1975 until his retirement, he was stationed with the 
U.S. Army's 8th Infantry Division in Bad Kreuznach, West Germany, as head of 
the classified document center.

The Bush Administration is working on a new strategic arms proposal that could 
help pave the way for the first summit meeting between President Bush and 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev later this year, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which Bush may announce later this month, will be aimed at 
closing the gaps on several issues in the four-year-old talks between the U.S. 
and the Soviet Union on long-range nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Administration officials said they expect to receive a formal response 
from Gorbachev soon to several U.S. proposals offered earlier this year on ways 
to improve the verification of a proposed strategic arms agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Up the Pace 
</P>
<P>
Both developments suggested that Bush, after moving slowly on the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Talks (START) during his first eight months in office, now wants 
to speed up the pace of negotiations to reduce the number of long-range nuclear 
missiles and bombs in U.S. and Soviet arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to provide details of discussions on the new U.S. arms 
proposal. "It's being worked at a very high level," said one. But they said it 
may include revised versions of pending U.S. proposals on verification as well 
as "some movement" on the long-debated issue of limits on cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Tangible progress in the START talks would improve the chances for a 
Bush-Gorbachev summit later this year, Administration officials have said. In 
addition, prospects for a summit are said to have been boosted by the swift 
pace of East-West negotiations over conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, however, Administration spokesmen remain noncommittal. "Our 
position remains that a summit meeting will be appropriate at some point, but 
we are not there yet," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The START talks, which began under President Ronald Reagan in 1985, are aimed 
at reducing the two superpowers' arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons -- the 
roughly 25,000 missile warheads and bombs with which each country could 
annihilate the other. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan Administration, U.S. and Soviet negotiators agreed to the 
framework of a treaty under which those weapons would be reduced by more than 
25%, including cuts of almost 50% in long-range ballistic missile warheads, the 
most dangerous nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But significant differences remain. One involves sea-launched cruise missiles, 
which the Soviet Union wants to ban or limit but the U.S. Navy wants to keep. 
Other issues are how to count and verify the number of air-launched cruise 
missiles in each country's bombers and how each country can verify that the 
other is keeping its word. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, Administration officials say they have been cheered by 
two factors in the Soviet position on START. 
</P>
<P>
First, Soviet officials appear to have eased their opposition to U.S. research 
on defenses against nuclear missiles -- the Strategic Defense Initiative, also 
known as "Star Wars." Although the Soviet Union still objects to the program, 
some officials believe that the Kremlin might accept continued U.S. research 
and testing -- in part, because Soviet experts don't believe a workable 
defensive system can be devised. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Moscow appears to have taken the Administration's proposals on 
verification seriously, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had wanted to, they could have come back and said . . . 'We're totally 
opposed to this,' but they didn't," one official said. Instead, the Soviets 
have been studying the proposals and have promised that Gorbachev will make a 
formal response soon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The verification proposals, offered by U.S. negotiators at the START talks in 
Geneva in June, include allowing each country to inspect the other's missile 
factories even before a treaty is ratified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Surprise Attack 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. proposal that officials said the Soviets have taken seriously is a 
ban on tests of "short time-of-flight missiles." These are high-speed nuclear 
missiles that could hit targets in seven minutes or less after being launched 
from submarines, thus making a surprise attack more possible. 
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. arms control proposal will also be on the agenda of talks later 
this month between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those talks, which will also cover the prospects for a U.S.-Soviet summit, will 
be held Sept. 22-23 at a lodge and at a log cabin in Wyoming's Grand Tetons. 
The meeting is the result of an agreement between Baker and Shevardnadze to 
give each other a chance to see more of their countries than just Washington 
and Moscow.

SWAPO'S GUERRILLAS ARE EXCHANGING THEIR FATIGUES FOR SUITS AND BULLETS FOR 
BALLOTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theo-Ben Gurirab, a young teacher with dreams of black liberation, stuffed some 
carefully falsified identity papers into his pocket 27 years ago and stole onto 
an outbound train just ahead of the South African authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Once outside Namibia's borders, he earned a master's degree at an American 
university, married an American fashion merchandiser -- and helped guide one of 
Africa's bloodiest guerrilla wars. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "Comrade Ben" and most of his fellow, middle-aged guerrilla leaders have 
returned in their silk ties and Italian loafers to the territory where they 
would have been hanged for treason only a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come back to wage an election campaign," Gurirab said the other day in 
the new $1.1-million headquarters of SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's 
Organization. Later, he took a chauffeur-driven car from SWAPO's motor pool to 
catch a plane for consultations in Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Bullets to Ballots 
</P>
<P>
After a war that cost 20,000 lives and a diplomatic struggle that stretched 
over a decade, SWAPO's guerrillas have laid down their arms and returned to 
this vast, dry and sparsely populated territory to fight their final battle at 
the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO is heavily favored to win the U.N.-monitored elections, which will 
formally end 74 years of South African control here. And Theo-Ben Gurirab, 49, 
the rebels' bearded international affairs chief and for 15 years SWAPO's U.N. 
representative, is likely to become foreign minister of the world's newest 
independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
On his first weekend home, Gurirab drove to Usakos, his birthplace, and was 
introduced for the first time to a passel of nieces, nephews and cousins -- and 
heard how his uncles and aunts were harassed by the authorities for months 
after his disappearance in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to my roots, walking around the places I had not seen in so long, . 
. . that's when I realized I was truly back home," Gurirab said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banners and Slogans 
</P>
<P>
The Namibia he has returned to is draped in colorful banners, its airwaves and 
newspapers clogged with sloganizing and mudslinging, and everyone from black 
guerrillas to white farmers has taken to the hustings for a first taste of free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Namibia's march to nationhood was almost halted by an outbreak of fighting in 
April, but now it again is moving toward November elections under the gaze of 
5,000 U.N. troops, 1,500 U.N. police officers and dozens of international 
monitoring commissions. Namibia's independence is a key component of the 
U.S.-brokered peace accord, which has begun a Cuban troop pullout from Angola 
and opened the way to peace in southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But the territory remains tense, with allegations of voter intimidation by both 
former guerrillas and the South Africa-led police force. In recent weeks, a 
grenade attack on a U.N. base left a private security guard dead, a 10-year-old 
SWAPO supporter was struck in the forehead and critically injured by an arrow, 
and a campaign worker for the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, SWAPO's main rival 
party, was gunned down in his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Write New Constitution 
</P>
<P>
In five days of voting beginning Nov. 6, about 700,000 people will select a 
constituent assembly, which will then need a two-thirds majority to write a new 
constitution. The U.N. special representative here will be called upon to 
verify that the South Africa-administered elections are "free and fair." The 
organization that once ambushed South African military patrols and planted 
bombs in butcher shops and hotels has become, virtually overnight, the picture 
of mainstream party politics. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO's modern five-story headquarters in Windhoek's quiet downtown is crammed 
with computers, copiers, fax machines and office workers. At least one 
photograph of SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, and sometimes two or three, hangs on 
every office wall. Behind the desks are men wearing Nujoma-style beards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a madhouse, really," Hidipo Hamutenya, SWAPO's information secretary, 
told one of a dozen callers who interrupted an interview in his office one 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Hamutenya and Gurirab are two of SWAPO's top seven leaders, and they met that 
day with a half-dozen officials, including a U.S. Senate staff delegation. 
Nujoma himself has yet to return to Namibia; SWAPO leaders say they are waiting 
for an appropriate time to bring back "our big gun," as one put it. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO has 10,000 campaign workers, all volunteers working for food and housing, 
in 16 offices. They are trying to get as many voters registered as possible 
before the Sept. 15 deadline, selling SWAPO posters and buttons, typing 
letters, ferrying officials in some of the organization's 300 cars, and lodging 
frequent complaints with the U.N. and the South African administration about 
alleged pre-election irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO complains that South Africa's registrars have been lax in their 
registration efforts in the rural north, the birthplace of SWAPO, where 60% of 
Namibia's 1.3 million population lives. So far, 250,000 voters have registered 
in the northern province of Ovambo, and SWAPO says thousands have been 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16-Hour Journeyu to Polls 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO also thinks South Africa is trying to rig the election by encouraging 
South Africans to travel to Namibia to vote. So far, more than 3,000 white 
South Africans have registered, some making 16-hour journeys in chartered 
buses. Under the registration rules, anyone who lived in Namibia for four years 
or had a parent born in Namibia is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks SWAPO has come under increasing criticism for its wartime 
activities. Some of the 203 Namibian prisoners, most of them black, whom SWAPO 
released, have told of being tortured and incarcerated in dungeons in Angola 
and Zambia, and they say hundreds died in detention. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO was slow to respond to the allegations, which worry some Namibians who 
fear that the elections will install a brutal SWAPO government. 
</P>
<P>
"They were beaten up. . . . I guess that's torture," Hamutenya said. "We did 
not authorize torture. But if it was done, people must recognize the 
conditions. When you've just buried 50 of your comrades and discover that 
someone betrayed you . . . it's lucky these people were not lynched." 
</P>
<P>
Among those detained by SWAPO over the years were leading figures in the 
organization, reportedly including Sam Nujoma's wife, who was later released. 
</P>
<P>
"Some, we are convinced, were hard-core agents," Gurirab said. "Some, we have 
come to conclude, were innocent, and some could have gone either way." He added 
that SWAPO "very much regrets" instances of torture and "if we find those 
responsible we will hold them accountable." 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO waged its 23-year war from exile headquarters in Luanda, the capital of 
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor, fighting a South African force of 50,000 
stationed in northern Namibia with about 10,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Since SWAPO's founding in 1957, the rebels' stated goal has been to establish a 
classless, non-exploitative society in Namibia based on socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of socialism over 
capitalism," SWAPO says in its election manifesto. It says, for example, that 
the territory's land is unfairly distributed -- 60% is owned by whites, who 
account for 6% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
But, seeing the failure of Marxist economies across Africa, SWAPO has adopted a 
more practical stance in the past year. It has promised not to nationalize the 
mining industry, which is responsible for most of Namibia's income, but the 
organization says it wants to renegotiate agreements with private mining 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Room for Whites to Stay' 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO also has pledged to encourage white farmers to stay, although it says 
people owning many large farms may be forced to sell most of them to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"There's room for whites to stay, and we want them to stay," Hamutenya said. 
"They will be making a mistake if they panic and run away. But we will have to 
cut some of their privileges. That cannot go on." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the SWAPO leadership and some of the 41,000 refugees who have 
returned are rediscovering the land of their birth. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks so different," Hamutenya said. "The rapid desertification of 
the north . . . everything was so much greener before. I remembered tall 
buildings in Windhoek, but compared to New York they are just cornerstones." 
</P>
<P>
Gurirab's three children, ages 11 to 16, have never seen Namibia and, Gurirab 
admits, they aren't looking forward to living here. 
</P>
<P>
When Gurirab asked them what they thought about leaving their American schools 
and moving to Namibia, "they said they didn't care to come here," Gurirab 
recalled. "What will happen to their friends? That was their big worry."

TRITIUM SALES RESUMED BY ENERGY DEPT.

The Energy Department announced Friday it has resumed selling tritium to U.S. 
and foreign companies even though it has failed to find missing amounts of the 
radioactive gas that can be used in making nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The department is satisfied that none of the missing material was diverted for 
illicit production of nuclear weapons, said spokesman Phil Keif, although a 
government report released Friday said investigators could not prove there was 
no diversion. 
</P>
<P>
Keif said that of the five grams of tritium that were missing when a team of 
Energy Department and Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials began searching 
in June, only a small fraction of one gram has been accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies were reported by several commercial customers, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The department usually sells about 200 grams a year of tritium to commercial 
users, raising about $5 million annually. Government information about tritium 
supplies is classified, but experts estimate that about four grams are used in 
a single atomic warhead as a means of boosting its explosive power. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial sales were suspended in July because of the discrepancies. After 
revamping handling procedures, the department decided to resume sales to all 
customers except those for which shipment discrepancies remained. 
</P>
<P>
Tritium is produced in nuclear reactors at the government's Savannah River 
complex near Aiken, S.C., mainly for use in nuclear warheads. Smaller amounts 
are sold to private companies for use in biological and energy research, as 
well as in the manufacture of luminous lights, signs and dials. 
</P>
<P>
No U.S. tritium has been produced for more than a year because the Savannah 
River reactors have been shut down for repairs and management improvements. The 
sales that resumed Friday will come from stockpiles.

The genetically altered virus released in a cabbage patch three weeks ago in 
the first test of its kind has been killing off the pest it is supposed to 
fight and then dying off right on schedule, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
The virus killed off all the cabbage looper insects that it was supposed to as 
part of the controlled experiment, said H. Alan Wood, a virologist at the Boyce 
Thompson Institute for Plant Research. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which is conducting the tests at Cornell University's 
Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, had the field sprayed for a second 
time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very gratifying," Wood said. "Our application technology was perfect. 
Everything was working just the way we predicted it would." 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 9 spraying made history as the first field release of a genetically 
altered virus in the United States. The experiment was heralded as a milestone 
in the development of non-chemical methods of pest control. 
</P>
<P>
The virus was genetically altered in the laboratory to be short-lived so that 
it would pose no threat of uncontrolled spreading.

JUDGE ABSOLVES WEATHER SERVICE OF BLAME IN '85 DELTA PLANE CRASH THAT KILLED 
137

<P>
A federal judge, saying the crew was negligent for trying to land during a 
severe thunderstorm, on Friday absolved the National Weather Service and air 
traffic controllers of negligence in the 1985 crash of a Delta Air Lines 
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
In a 72-page opinion, U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr. said Delta "failed 
to prove that the United States of America was guilty of any negligence." 
</P>
<P>
In the longest major aviation trial in U.S. history, attorneys for Delta argued 
that the weather service was to blame for the crash at Dallas-Ft. Worth 
International Airport because crew members did not have sufficient warning 
about the severity of a thunderstorm at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed L-1011, en route from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Dallas, crashed 
while trying to land on Aug. 2, 1985, when it was caught in a downburst of 
wind, killing 137 people. 
</P>
<P>
A National Transportation Safety Board investigation had blamed wind shear for 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
But in his ruling, Belew said the crew of Delta Flight 191 knew, or should have 
known, that there was severe weather on the approach to the airport, and that 
the thunderstorms were likely to cause dangerous wind shear, an abrupt change 
in wind direction and force. 
</P>
<P>
Belew said that "attempting to land the aircraft in a thunderstorm constituted 
negligence on the part of the crew of DL-191, and proximately caused the 
crash." 
</P>
<P>
Although air traffic controllers failed to route the jet to another runway, the 
judge said that failure did not constitute negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of the millions 
of dollars in claims arising from the crash. The Atlanta-based airline said it 
would appeal the decision, noting that it was "in direct conflict with the 
recent jury verdict . . . in Ft. Lauderdale holding Delta blameless in all 
respects for the accident." 
</P>
<P>
Delta "continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case clearly 
establish total government responsibility for the tragic accident." 
</P>
<P>
The trial began in March, 1988, and lasted almost 14 months, although it 
recessed several times so Belew could clear backlogged criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The government argued that the flight crew did not heed FAA tower warnings, did 
not ask for weather information and decided to fly into the storm. The 
government also said the jet's radar should have warned the pilots of weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Delta has paid at least $66 million in death, injury and damage claims from the 
Flight 191 crash, but in those cases survivors waived the issue of liability. 
In the only previous case that considered liability, a U.S. District Court jury 
in Ft. Lauderdale determined that Delta was blameless in the crash.

SLAYING MAY BE CATALYST THAT DECIDES N.Y. MAYOR RACE

<P>
The racial violence that has shaken a Brooklyn neighborhood has magnified the 
battle of constituency politics for the chief contenders in New York's bitterly 
fought Democratic mayoral primary. 
</P>
<P>
Fear and anger, many politicians believe, could drive up turnout, and the 
candidate best able to mobilize his supporters could win what is perceived as a 
very close election on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to mobilize black voters, Manhattan Borough President David N. 
Dinkins, who is seeking to become the city's first black mayor, will campaign 
with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. But the appearances are designed to be muted, in 
the hope of not alienating the white voters, particularly liberal Jews, that 
Dinkins needs to win. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Edward I. Koch is airing a TV commercial featuring paralyzed 
police officer Steven McDonald, who was shot on duty in Central Park on July 
12, 1986. The trauma of McDonald's ordeal is clear in his voice and on his 
face, filling the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Koch is a mayor who is good for our cops and our kids too," the policeman 
tells potential voters. "He is a mayor who knows that the things that unite us 
outweigh the things that divide us. He hurts when we hurt. He smiles when we 
smile. He leads when others won't." 
</P>
<P>
The camera then pans to McDonald's wife, Patti Ann. "Ed Koch has been a good 
mayor and a good friend," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Bensonhurst and its potential backlash have brought new attention to white 
Catholic voters. These voters had supported the mayor in his early years, but 
most recently, because of charges of corruption in the Koch Administration, 
they were dissatisfied with the mayor. In recent Democratic mayoral elections, 
many white Catholics simply stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
The Koch commercial is a clear effort to change that and win over these voters, 
who had been expected to be largely indifferent to the contest between Koch and 
Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
Which appeals will work best in the charged environment are still uncertain. 
New Yorkers arose Friday to television newscasts and the front pages of 
tabloids showing pictures of policemen clashing with black demonstrators at one 
end of the Brooklyn Bridge. Headlines proclaimed "Rage" and "Outrage." 
</P>
<P>
The funeral Wednesday of a black youth who was shot to death 10 days ago in 
Bensonhurst was as much a political event as an exercise in mourning. Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo and Koch faced hecklers outside the church. The Rev. Louis 
Farrakhan, who has disparaged Jews, preached the principal sermon. Jackson, who 
attended the wake the night before, did not come to the funeral. Some sources 
said it was because of Farrakhan's presence. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, black activist Rev. Al Sharpton and others organized a "Day of 
Outrage." Some 7,500 demonstrators seeking to march on City Hall to protest the 
death of Yusuf Hawkins clashed with police at the Brooklyn end of the Brooklyn 
Bridge. Protesters hurled bottles, sticks and bricks at police, injuring 44 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Joseph Fama, the 18-year-old white youth suspected of firing the 
shots that killed Hawkins, was held without bail on charges of 2nd-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Dinkins believe the anger over Bensonhurst will bring greater 
numbers of black voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But the killing has also "reintroduced Al Sharpton and the Rev. Farrakhan into 
the middle of the contest," said Richard Wade, a professor of urban history at 
the City University of New York's Graduate Center. "The two of them have always 
frightened whites of all persuasion -- liberals as well as conservatives -- 
much more than Jesse Jackson. Their prominence may transform the election from 
a contest between Dinkins and Koch to a contest between Sharpton and Koch. In 
that election, the advantage is clearly on Koch's side." 
</P>
<P>
In Democratic mayoral primaries, black voters contribute more than a quarter of 
the total vote, Jewish voters more than one third. Most politicians expect 
Dinkins to do well among liberal Jewish voters, Koch to draw strongly among 
conservative Jews.

GOVERNOR URGED TO ASSUME PROP. 103 RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of California Common Cause, in a lengthy letter to Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Friday, asked the governor to assume personal responsibility for 
the implementation of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Writing that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and her department are 
"clearly floundering" and have lost the confidence of the public, Common Cause 
official Walter Zelman urged the governor to restore public confidence in the 
state's effort to implement the landmark insurance initiative. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor was traveling and there would be 
no immediate comment. A political consultant recently hired by Gillespie, Stu 
Mollrich, noted that Zelman, a Democrat, has been mentioned as considering 
running for insurance commissioner next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Full-Blown Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Zelman said, "The Proposition 103 implementation problem is 
becoming a full-blown crisis in government administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The crisis we perceive is not one of personnel or even insurance," he wrote. 
"It is a crisis of public confidence in the capacity of California government 
to execute state law. We fear that the governmental process is becoming an 
object of public anger, scorn and ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government, and specifically the Department of Insurance, appears adrift 
and unable to cope with its new administrative burden or with the political 
controversy that is part of the 103 implementation process." 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said the public has come to believe that Gillespie and her department 
have been "either biased, ineffective, indecisive or without direction." 
</P>
<P>
He accused Gillespie of allowing months to pass without preparing 
implementation procedures, resisting certain parts of Proposition 103 while 
advocating alternative insurance reform solutions such as no-fault, failing to 
organize well-defined hearings and data collection processes and exempting many 
insurers from rate rollbacks without fully disclosing why. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Zelman told Deukmejian, "The direct involvement of 
your office is now mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
He asked the governor to convene a high-level representative task force of all 
major groups to reach reasonable compromises on implementation procedures, 
insist that Gillespie hold hearings on major issues such as what rate of return 
the insurance companies should be allowed, agree to finance consumer 
representation in the upcoming proceedings and make it clear that the full 
authority of the governor's office is behind implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Barring this, there will be "more public frustration and anger and a further 
decline in public confidence in governmental institutions," Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie consultant Mollrich responded later that "Zelman may as well ask the 
governor to take over the Legislature. They're not doing the job either." 
</P>
<P>
Mollrich, coordinator of the oust-Rose Bird campaign three years ago and the 
campaign for the property-tax cutting Proposition 13 a decade ago, was recently 
retained by Gillespie to assess her chances of keeping her post when it becomes 
an elective office next year. 
</P>
<P>
He said Friday he has just begun his assessment and cannot say when it will be 
completed. But he disagreed with those who have been saying that Gillespie 
ruined her chances when she decided that hundreds of insurance companies should 
be exempted from the Proposition 103 rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no perception of Gillespie that has really impacted the public at 
all," Mollrich said in an interview. "There have been a few stories over a 
one-week period about her exemption decisions, but they won't have a 
tremendously long impact.

MEDFLY FOUND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY; TRAPS SET

A Mediterranean fruit fly has been found in Santa Clara County, the 
battleground of the state's 1980-82 Medfly war, the state Food and Agriculture 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The fly, an adult male, was found Thursday in one of the state's insect traps 
hung on a pear tree in Mountain View, said John Connell, the department's 
supervisor for pesticide projects in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
He said department employees have begun placing 1,700 additional insect traps 
in an 81-square-mile area around the find to see if a breeding population of 
flies is present. They also will examine fruit trees for Medfly larvae. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment there is no reason to call it an infestation," Connell said, 
adding that no aerial or ground spraying programs are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly is a major destroyer of fruit, vegetable and nut crops. At its peak, 
the 1980-82 infestation spread over about 3,900 square miles in Santa Clara, 
San Mateo, Alameda and San Benito counties. 
</P>
<P>
The state already is fighting a Medfly infestation in the region west of Dodger 
Stadium in Los Angeles, where about 40 of the flies have been found since late 
July. There has been one aerial application of malathion in a 16-square-mile 
region around the core of that infestation, Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, the state began a program of releasing sterile flies in the region 
to cut down on Medfly reproduction. It also is sampling backyard fruit in the 
area in a search for eggs of the insect.

VINCENNES TOO AGGRESSIVE IN DOWNING JET, OFFICER WRITES

A Navy commander, engaging in unusually frank public criticism, said the U.S. 
warship Vincennes that shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290 people, had 
been given the derogatory nickname "Robo Cruiser" for its aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. David R. Carlson of the frigate Sides, which was in the Persian Gulf at 
the time of the July 3, 1988, downing, wrote in the September issue of the U.S. 
Naval Institute magazine Proceedings that the aggressiveness of the Vincennes, 
commanded by Capt. Will Rogers III, was well known among naval officers in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the 
incident, my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of restraint was not her 
long suit," Carlson wrote. "Her actions appeared to be consistently aggressive 
and had become a topic of wardroom conversation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unamusing Nickname' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Robo Cruiser' was the unamusing nickname that someone jokingly came up with 
for her, and it stuck," Carlson wrote. "My guess was that the crew of the 
Vincennes felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis (the sophisticated 
anti-aircraft system on the cruiser) in the Persian Gulf and that they hankered 
for the opportunity to show their stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson wrote that the Vincennes started a sea battle with Iranian gunboats 
earlier in the day in response to what may have been nothing more than warning 
shots from the boats feeling threatened by the cruiser's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
When the Iranian airliner came along later, the crew of the Vincennes 
misidentified the plane as an Iranian F-14 fighter jet and shot it down, though 
the Sides' radar showed the craft to be climbing and to be "a non-threat." 
</P>
<P>
"The Vincennes announced her intentions to take TN 4131 (Track No. 4131, the 
Iranian airliner) with missiles at 20 miles. I wondered aloud in disbelief, but 
I did not do the one thing that might have helped. I did not think to push for 
a reevaluation of IFF (identification of friend or foe)," Carlson wrote.

The milk contains beta-lactam, an antibiotic residue of penicillin that could 
cause an allergic reaction in some people but does not pose a general health 
risk, state health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the milk was shipped to 80 7-Eleven stores in Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties and 40 of the convenience stores in San 
Diego County. Officials said they do not know how the penicillin got into the 
milk products.

<P>
The products affected by the recall are one-gallon containers of whole milk 
dated Sept. 10, half-gallons of nonfat milk dated Sept. 9 and pints and quarts 
of Nestle's chocolate milk dated Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
An Adohr spokeswoman said the recall is a "voluntary precaution" and no 
illnesses had been reported.

Mayor Marion Barry asked Friday to meet with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh over 
press reports that federal investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack 
cocaine on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Thornburgh, Barry said disclosures concerning the Justice 
Department's investigation into his links with convicted drug dealer Charles 
Lewis have damaged his ability to govern the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Thornburgh would follow U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens' request 
for a full investigation into the disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fundamental Principles' 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue bigger than Marion Barry Jr. and the politics of the District 
of Columbia," Barry said in the letter. "It is about the fundamental principles 
upon which our system of laws is based." 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, refused Friday to 
comment directly on the mayor's request, but indicated that an inquiry is 
standard in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"You can assume whenever there is an unauthorized disclosure of information, 
there will be an investigation," Runkel said.

VAN DE KAMP ACCUSED OF HIDING DATA ON PLAN'S ALLEGED ABORTION RIGHTS THREAT 
</P>

<P>
Backers of a proposed anti-crime initiative charged Friday that Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp is hiding documents that relate to his conclusion that the 
measure could be used to abolish abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Four legislators said at a Capitol news conference that they suspect that the 
documents Van de Kamp refuses to disclose show he is really playing politics 
and that his assertion that the initiative could be used to repeal California's 
legal protection for women seeking an abortion is not legally sound. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Martland, one of Van de Kamp's top aides, said afterward that the 
attorney general will continue to keep the documents confidential, even though 
the four lawmakers said they will file a lawsuit next week to force their 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was the latest salvo in a political skirmish over the 
proposed crime victims justice reform act, for which signatures are being 
gathered to place it on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is laden with implications for next year's campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
It is backed by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the only Republican candidate, who hopes 
it will boost his campaign. It is endorsed by former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein, who is running against Van de Kamp for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Days after Feinstein announced her support for the initiative, Van de Kamp said 
he feared a provision in it restricting the right of privacy could cause the 
state Supreme Court to repeal abortion rights, which in California are 
protected largely by a 1972 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Wilson, who like Feinstein and Van de Kamp is pro-choice, to pull the 
initiative from circulation and redraft it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and other backers of the measure refused. They contend that its language 
is clear that it applies only to criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The four lawmakers who held the news conference are Republican Sens. John 
Seymour and Ed Royce, both of Anaheim; Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), and 
Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Documents Demanded 
</P>
<P>
Seymour and Royce back Wilson, Boatwright has endorsed Feinstein and Kopp said 
he expects to sit out the governor's race next year. 
</P>
<P>
They said they have demanded that Van de Kamp release documents drafted in his 
office relating to the initiative and showing the process he used to reach his 
conclusion. They contend that the document should be public under the 
California Public Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has given them a list of 70 documents, several relating to the 
abortion issue, but refuses to release them. 
</P>
<P>
Martland said the documents are confidential because lawyers working for Van de 
Kamp are allowed to advise him confidentially. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said they believe that the documents will show that Van de Kamp 
was advised by his aides that the initiative would not affect abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) tried to get a procedural 
waiver in the Senate to allow consideration of a second anti-crime amendment. 
Keene's proposal is similar to the one supported by Wilson and Feinstein, but 
it did not have the controversial language objected to by Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, however, refused to give the amendment the green light, with 
Republicans arguing that the measure was only an attempt to embarrass Wilson 
and subvert the measure.

DOW UP 14.82 ON GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS

Blue chips rose to a record closing high Friday in slow pre-holiday trading, 
bolstered by a rebounding bond market after a report showing weakness in the 
manufacturing sector eased fears of an overheating economy. The Dow Jones index 
of 30 industrials rose 14.82 to a new high of 2,752.09, surpassing the previous 
peak of 2,743.36 reached Monday and bringing its gain for the week to 19.73 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 5 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 133.30 million shares, down from 143.42 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of economic reports was open to varying interpretations but, on 
balance, financial markets reacted favorably to the figures. 
</P>
<P>
A report on the job market, which provided the first glimpse of economic 
conditions last month, suggested that the economy is growing at a moderate 
rate, making the threat of recession seem more remote. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.1% in 
August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a total that was reduced by 
about 108,000 due to strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a Commerce Department report pointed to a rebound in momentum after 
months of sluggish economic activity earlier this year. The index of leading 
economic indicators rose a modest 0.2% in July after registering no gain in 
June and plunging by 1.3% in May, the biggest drop since late 1987 following 
the stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Countering the positive economic news was the August survey of the nation's 
purchasing managers. The National Assn. of Purchasing Management's monthly poll 
showed lingering weakness in the industrial side of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors headed the list of actively traded shares on the Big Board. It 
added 1 to 50 and more than 2 million shares changed hands. Other major auto 
makers also posted gains: Ford rose 3/8 to 54 1/4 and Chrysler gained 3/8 to 
27. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the blue chips contributing to the advance in the Dow Jones industrial 
average included: Exxon, up 1/4 to 44; General Electric, up 5/8 to 58 1/4; 
International Business Machines, up 1/4 to 117 3/8; McDonald's, up 1/4 to 29 
1/8; Merck, up 1/8 to 73 5/8, and Philip Morris, up 3/4 to 164 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover speculation continued to preoccupy traders. Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 
1 1/8 to 53 1/2 amid what were described as vague takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks made a comeback from Thursday's selloff. UAL, parent of United 
Airlines, jumped 7 1/4 to 287 on word that the pilots union was preparing to 
make a bid for the carrier. AMR, owner of American, rose 1 3/4 to 89 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed lower in moderate trading, 
discouraged by the Japanese yen's continued fall against the dollar. The Nikkei 
225-share average fell 82.98 points to end the week at 34,348.22. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, share prices soared to a 1989 high in improved 
volume with the Financial Times 100-share index index closing up 19.6 points at 
2,407.5. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged higher, boosted by the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Management's report that suggested a possible slowdown in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 13/16 point, or about $8.13 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield slumped to 8.12% from 8.19% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was light and ended early ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading after the Labor Department released its 
employment report. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a vigorous economy dashed traders' hopes that the Federal 
Reserve would relax credit, allowing interest rates to fall and bond prices to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
But prices roared back after release of the Purchasing Managers' Index. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.938%, up from 8.875% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against all major foreign currencies following the release of 
the positive economic data. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose domestically after weakening overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $360.60 an ounce, up 70 cents from late Thursday. Republic National Bank of 
New York quoted a late bid for gold of $359.25 an ounce, up 65 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's ascent began after the government released the monthly employment 
report. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.17 yen to a closing 145.45 yen from Thursday's 144.28. It was quoted at 
145.23 yen in London, and at 145.60 yen in New York, up from 145.065.

fiscal 1988. Revenue rose 9.3% to $38.9 million. The firm said 1989 earnings 
included a $318,000 extraordinary credit from tax-loss carry-forwards and

OCTOGENARIAN BARMAID IS NO HANGOVER FROM THE OLD DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Barmaid Carrie Felix uses an old bouncer's technique when she has to kick 
someone out of the El Sereno lounge where she works. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Felix is an old bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
"I just ask them real nice to leave," says Felix, 80. "Usually they do. Being 
older gives me more respect." 
</P>
<P>
Felix has served up drinks and banter for 17 years at the Stop Off, a bar at 
the edge of a working-class neighborhood. She is an anomaly in a job not often 
filled by grandmotherly types in polyester pantsuits; in fact, the California 
Restaurant Assn. reports that the median age of female beverage and food 
workers in the United States is 26. 
</P>
<P>
"My jaw dropped the first time we walked in and saw her," bar patron Linnea 
Petschar said. "I teased my husband Harry that it was too bad she wasn't 
wearing a miniskirt." 
</P>
<P>
Night bartender Frank Sopher admits to being shocked when he first learned he 
would be pouring drinks with an octogenarian. "The first day I came to work 
here and saw her behind the bar, it blew my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot Felix stirs screwdrivers and slings Singapores on a shelf behind the 
bar because she is too short to mix drinks on top. But she has no problem 
trading jibes over the bar with the regulars who line it daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people off if they need it," Felix said. "I tell them in a nice way. If 
that doesn't work, I tell them off in a less-nice way. I don't want to brag, 
but I'm a bouncer, too." 
</P>
<P>
Felix said her age is no handicap in handling a bar crowd, although she 
bristles when some first-time patrons address her as "mom" when ordering up a 
beer. She likes it even less when they call her "grandma." 
</P>
<P>
"I set them straight. I tell them I work here -- that I'm not their mother," 
she said. Privately, however, that's the way Felix is viewed by some of the 
regulars at the Stop Off, a Huntington Drive South fixture since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family-type place, and she adds a motherly mood to it," said Al 
Martinez, a truck driver who has frequented the bar for three years. "The first 
time I came here and saw an elderly lady behind the bar, I figured she had to 
be the owner. Now, I see her like my mom." 
</P>
<P>
Felix began her full-time lounge job after she retired at age 62 as a waitress 
at a downtown Los Angeles cafeteria. "I told the cafeteria I wanted to quit 
then because I might not live to be 65," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Felix quickly grew bored sitting around her El Sereno home, located near 
the Stop Off. When the owner of the bar asked her if she could help out, she 
signed up for what she expected to be a temporary job. 
</P>
<P>
Current bar owner Bob Cadena said he had no qualms about keeping Felix on when 
he took over four years ago. He said she handles everything from cases of empty 
beer bottles to preparation of daily lunch specials served at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not kidding you. She's also a bouncer -- she chases the guys out," Cadena 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unruly customers are rare because of the bar's neighborhood clientele, although 
Felix keeps a lead-weighted stick beneath the bar. "She never uses it, but she 
pulls it out playfully if customers start harassing her," Sopher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Carrie breaks through the generation gap. Kids who have just turned 21 and 
guys who have been coming here 35 years -- she relates to them all." 
</P>
<P>
The regulars relate to her, too. When Felix turned 80 in April, bar patrons 
threw her a party. Some, such as Sally Castaneda and Martha Alexander, invite 
Felix along when they go places, such as Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"Carrie takes advantage of her age," laughed Al Martinet, a retired carpet 
salesman who frequently stops off for a beer. 
</P>

POLICE SEEKING CAR SEEN NEAR SCENE OF MENENDEZ KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Police are investigating whether a vehicle observed near the Beverly Hills home 
of slain entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife was the same as one 
seen near the spot where a San Fernando Valley pornography dealer was murdered 
last month, The Times learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, an informed source said detectives are interested in 
talking to actor Sylvester Stallone as they explore a variety of leads in the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Suspect 
</P>
<P>
Stallone is not a suspect, the source said. The actor is a director of Carolco 
Pictures Inc., a film company that owns almost half the stock in the company of 
which Menendez was chief executive, Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a 
video and music distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were shot to death Aug. 20 in the 
library of their residence on North Elm Drive. Law enforcement sources have 
said that the couple apparently were slain by two men firing 12-gauge shotguns 
at close range. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police have declined to discuss their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But informed law enforcement sources outside the department said a "white 
hatchback" automobile was seen near their home about the time of the slayings. 
It was not known if law enforcement officers know the make and year of the 
vehicle or its license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Observed at Scene 
</P>
<P>
A "white hatchback" was also observed in Northridge on Aug. 1 near the street 
where Theodore Snyder, 47, a producer of X-rated videos, was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Court affidavits show that Snyder's company, Video Cassette Recordings Inc., 
did business with and owed money to a firm allegedly controlled by Martin 
Taccetta, a man linked by federal prosecutors to the Lucchese crime family. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's homicide is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, 
which has not commented on the progress of its inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation by Beverly Hills detectives has taken off in a number of 
directions, apparently reflecting the complexity of the case and the large 
number of transactions in which Menendez's firm was involved. 
</P>
<P>
In this framework, detectives want to talk to Stallone in their search for 
information about some of these business associations. Stallone, a 
knowledgeable source said, has not yet been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone is the star of the macho Rambo movies, which have been huge financial 
successes for the West Hollywood-based Carolco. Carolco owns 49% of Live 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed in Merger 
</P>
<P>
Live Entertainment was formed earlier this year with the merger of 
International Video Entertainment, a video distributor, and Lieberman 
Enterprises, a Minneapolis-based music and video company. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez was also a director and executive vice president of Carolco, where 
Stallone is a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Stallone had about a 10% interest in International Video 
Entertainment until it was merged with the Lieberman firm in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Live Entertainment announced that it had retained the New York law 
firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison to conduct an internal 
inquiry into the Menendez slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm is the same one that represented New York record executive Morris 
Levy, who was convicted in May, 1988, of conspiring to extort payments from a 
record wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Levy, according to law enforcement officials and court records, has been a 
business associate of Vincent (The Chin) Gigante, said by federal authorities 
to be the boss of the Genovese crime family. Levy has denied any association 
with organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Live Entertainment purchased Strawberries Records, Tapes and CDS, 
a New England retail chain, from Levy. 
</P>
<P>
"Given Mr. Levy's previous history, the due diligence process for the purchase 
of Strawberries was unusually careful and exhaustive," Live Entertainment said 
in its statement on the selection of the Paul, Weiss firm. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Borisoff, an attorney for Paul, Weiss, said Friday that the firm no 
longer represents Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Carolco's chief executive, Peter M. Hoffman, who with the loss of Menendez has 
become acting chairman of Live Entertainment, said in a telephone interview 
that "we were, of course, aware that (Paul, Weiss) represented Morris Levy. We 
don't consider it a conflict because that representation has been terminated."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 21, GIVES BIRTH IN HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Antelope Valley woman gave birth to a baby boy Friday while en 
route to a hospital in a Fire Department helicopter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics delivered the healthy baby. 
The mother, Julie Enis, and her son Johnny were in good condition Friday at 
Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual delivery occurred during the 15-minute flight between Enis' home in 
the rural desert community of Lake Los Angeles and the hospital. The baby was 
delivered by paramedics Dan Coffman and Jack Ferme while pilot Bob Dunbar flew 
the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector John Lenihan said the airborne delivery was unusual because when 
birth is imminent, paramedics routinely deliver the baby at the mother's home 
rather than risk having to do so in a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually try to do it so it happens at the hospital or the house, not in the 
air," Lenihan said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Lake Los Angeles is a 20- to 30-minute ambulance drive from the closest 
fire station, Fire Department helicopters from Pacoima are routinely sent to 
emergency calls, Lenihan said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ferme's first delivery -- airborne or otherwise. But Coffman is a 
veteran. "My 23rd," he said proudly.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERY DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two armed-robbery defendants are responsible for the 1988 murder of an 
Inglewood police sergeant even though they are not charged with pulling the 
trigger, the prosecuting attorney argued in Torrance Superior Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joevone Elster, 23, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, face 25 years 
to life for first-degree murder and robbery charges in the March 31, 1988, 
shooting death of Inglewood Police Sgt. George Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer 
to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history -- was 
fired by Leslie Holget, also of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died after 
shooting himself at the end of a 45-mile chase that led police to Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, Aguilar was 
shot while in a high-speed chase of suspects in the armed robbery of a Los 
Angeles gas station money courier. 
</P>
<P>
Four defendants -- including Elster and Wilson -- were charged with robbing 
Masih Modani, the courier, of about $2,000. Because Aguilar was killed while 
investigating the robbery, all four defendants faced murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants, a 15-year-old, has been found guilty of first-degree 
murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Patrick 
Anthony Carr has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify 
in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He is awaiting sentencing.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 8 GANG MEMBERS ARRESTED IN RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In predawn raids that stretched from the Moreno Valley to Compton, federal and 
local law enforcement officials arrested eight gang members who police say had 
virtually taken control of a Compton housing project and made it the center of 
their cocaine distribution network, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Gang Task Force swept through 
the Wilmington Arms housing project in Compton about 6 a.m. Friday, seizing two 
kilograms of cocaine and arresting three members of a Crips faction that 
allegedly used the sprawling complex as their base for distributing rock 
cocaine, said John Martsh of the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Another dealer was arrested at his home in the Moreno Valley, while four other 
gang members were seized Thursday after they tried to sell cocaine to 
undercover drug agents, said DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge. 
</P>
<P>
The eight gang members will be prosecuted under federal rather than state law, 
and those who are repeat offenders could face a mandatory minimum of 20 years 
in federal prison if convicted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FACES MURDER CHARGE IN FATAL FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges that could carry the death penalty have been filed against a 
Glendale contractor accused of setting fire to a boarded-up house in Glassell 
Park, killing a squatter trapped inside and seriously injuring another, the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Paul Piumetti, 53, who owned the house, also was charged Thursday with 
attempted murder, arson and burglary stemming from the Aug. 21 fire, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Savitt. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Ortega Sandoval, 18, died after being overcome by smoke, and Miguel 
Martinez, 22, remains hospitalized with injuries suffered in the blaze, Savitt 
said. Both were illegal aliens who slept in the house without permission, 
Savitt said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of murder and arson, Piumetti could face the death penalty or be 
sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Savitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Piumetti was being held without bail, Savitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Piumetti and his brother bought the property in January and planned to build a 
multi-unit dwelling there, Savitt said. While awaiting a needed zoning change, 
Piumetti tried repeatedly to evict the transients who lived in the house, at 
one point boarding up the windows and doors, Savitt said. But the men returned, 
he said.

<P>
Brother Denys Cormier, a self-styled monk who runs a soup kitchen in the city, 
has gone to bat for the homeless by forming a softball team of street people. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the 35-year-old monk started the softball team, "The Soupers," to 
raise money for the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK). 
</P>
<P>
The team is made up of 22 homeless men, ranging in age from the early 20s to 
early 30s, who regularly eat at DESK. The Soupers play all challengers and, win 
or lose, ask their opponents for a donation. So far they have raised about 
$2,000 for the soup kitchen. DESK is the only soup kitchen in the area which 
serves hot meals at night. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 80 to 175 people to feed every day, and we needed a way to raise 
money," Cormier says. "I like sports and thought it would be easy to play 
softball because there are so many teams in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The Soupers play about once a week and so far have won three and lost three. 
But more important than their record, "the team has given the players a sense 
of self importance," Cormier says. 
</P>
<P>
Team captain Gordon Petteway, 22, agrees. "This team breaks the stereotype of 
the homeless," he said. "They aren't bad people. No one wants to stay homeless. 
We want to get some wins. It makes the other guys feel like they belong to 
something good." 
</P>
<P>
A strong sense of camaraderie has also developed among the players, Cormier 
says. "We've thrown people together who were not necessarily friends and 
they're now starting to gel. It's great to see." 
</P>
<P>
The Soupers softball team has drawn support from the New Haven area and beyond 
and has offers to play at more games before the summer is through.

CATHOLIC MESSAGE PAYS TRIBUTE TO LABOR UNION CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Labor unions, resented by totalitarian states and sometimes by corporate 
managers, are regarded by most historic churches as buttressing the rights and 
dignity of ordinary workers. 
</P>
<P>
Their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standards also have 
become protected by law in democratic countries. 
</P>
<P>
That point was underlined in the 1989 Labor Day message of the U.S. Catholic 
Conference. It cited a particularly dramatic modern example -- the 
union-spawned turn to democracy in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Similar union-backed thrusts for democracy were noted in other long-oppressed 
lands, sometimes meeting countermeasures. Some anti-union moves also were seen 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Americans "can now see how trade unions in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia 
unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom and solidarity of oppressed 
peoples," the message said. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Freedom, Justice and the Role of Unions," the statement pointed up the 
union-energized dawn of fuller rights in Poland, long under communist 
oppression, and said: 
</P>
<P>
"All men and women of good will are heartened by the successful struggle of 
Poland's workers, whose free, democratic trade union, 'Solidarnosc' 
(Solidarity) has become the instrument of progress, and we hope, liberation. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Working people in Hungary, in China, in South Africa and in Siberia and the 
Ukraine are asserting the same social values of human dignity, freedom and 
solidarity . . . as they work . . . to create the democratic trade unions. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Christianity and Judaism have special grounds for concern with the labor 
movement drawn from the Bible and its emphasis on mutual community 
responsibility for all persons in it, including its lowliest workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are members one of another," the apostle Paul wrote, stressing the duty of 
all to share the burdens and needs of fellow toilers, and also to uphold and 
celebrate their well-being. 
</P>
<P>
A tentmaker himself, as well as an evangelist, he saw work as honorable and 
essential, a part of God's unfolding creation. "We are co-workers with God." 
Sloth, termed by the church one of seven deadly sins, also drew Paul's scorn, 
"Let him who won't work not eat." 
</P>
<P>
Major churches in this century have voiced their support for union organization 
and collective bargaining to set standards for workers.

TALKS WITH POLYGRAM CONFIRMED; 
</P>
<P>
CO-FOUNDERS OF A&amp;M RECORDS CONSIDERING SALE OF COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By This story was reported and written by Times staff writer Jube Shiver Jr. 
and free-lance writer Paul Grein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A&amp;M Records founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss confirmed in a memorandum 
distributed to employees Friday that they are "having conversations with 
Polygram regarding future business opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The one-page memo did not disclose the terms under discussion for the company, 
which was founded by the pair in 1962 in trumpet player Alpert's Fairfax 
district garage. However, N. V. Philip's Polygram unit has reportedly offered 
about $500 million for closely held A&amp;M in a deal said not to include the 
company's real estate or music publishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Should these talks materialize into some sort of business transaction, you 
must know that we would only consider such a move if it strengthened our 
position in the industry," the A&amp;M executives, both 54, wrote in their 
memo. "Along with our artists and producers, A&amp;M's management and staff 
continue to remain our biggest asset and our highest priority for now and for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M officials would not comment on the memorandum, and Polygram officials 
could not be reached Friday. However, a spokeswoman for A&amp;M said that, 
although there was "a lot of discussion" about the memo among A&amp;M's staff, 
it was "business as usual" at the company. 
</P>
<P>
An acquisition of A&amp;M would be Polygram's second purchase of a large 
independent record company this summer and would continue a trend of 
consolidation in the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
Polygram, which ranks third in record sales behind Time Warner's labels and 
Sony Corp.'s CBS Records, announced last month that it had bought Island 
Records for a reported $331 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry 'Pretty Consolidated' 
</P>
<P>
Polygram already distributes A&amp;M's records in Europe. RCA Records is the 
U.S. distributor of A&amp;M Records, which has only a 2% market share and has 
long been rumored to be up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
If Polygram completes the purchase, analysts believe that it would help 
position the company for a run at CBS Records' second-place standing in the 
record industry. A purchase would leave only Geffen and Virgin records as 
major, independently owned labels. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry was pretty consolidated even before this rumor surfaced," said 
James C. Goss, an analyst for the Duff &amp; Phelps investment house in 
Chicago. "You already had a near oligopoly." 
</P>
<P>
However, Goss said he didn't believe that the proposed deal would result in 
increased record prices or reduce opportunities for new recording artists. 
</P>
<P>
Finding hot new talent has lately been problematic for A&amp;M. Although the 
Hollywood-based company had been one of the industry's most consistently 
successful labels for more than 25 years, it has performed poorly this year. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M has annual sales of between $220 million and $300 million, according to 
analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M currently has just one album in the top 100: "Surprise Attack" by the 
hard rock group Tora Tora Tora. However, the company has high hopes for a 
forthcoming release by Janet Jackson, whose last album, "Control," sold nearly 
5 million copies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry expected that Alpert and Moss might wait until A&amp;M 
climbed out of its current slump before selling the company. And some sources 
close to the talks said Friday that Alpert and Moss may consider selling only a 
minority stake in their company. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that if Jackson's album is released soon and sells well, Alpert and 
Moss may wait for a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. reportedly has expressed interest in A&amp;M as a music 
operation to compete with entertainment industry rivals MCA Inc. and Time 
Warner. But analysts contacted Friday said the Polygram bid was too far along 
for A&amp;M to be considering other offers.

110,000 NEW JOBS CREATED, UNEMPLOYMENT DIPS 0.1% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's economy posted another sign of continuing vitality Friday as the 
government reported that 110,000 jobs were created in August, despite 
widespread telephone strikes, while unemployment edged downward to 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The August figures were greeted warmly by economists, who said they provide 
fresh evidence that the economy is maintaining a moderate rate of growth rather 
than sliding into recession or accelerating into inflation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the surprising resilience of the economy, which appears 
likely to enter an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth in November, 
makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve Board will cause interest rates to 
fall any further. 
</P>
<P>
August's job growth follows an adjusted increase of 184,000 jobs in July, the 
Labor Department reported. If strikes had not occurred at several regional Bell 
telephone companies, new employment would have been 218,000 last month, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment, which has hovered near 5% all year, ticked downward to 5.1% in 
August from 5.2% in July. A separate unemployment measure excluding members of 
the armed forces living in the United States remained unchanged at 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economists Pleased 
</P>
<P>
In California, civilian unemployment fell steeply to 4.5% last month from 5.3%. 
State employment estimates are considered far more volatile than the nationwide 
surveys conducted by the Census Bureau every month. 
</P>
<P>
Economists were generally upbeat about the employment figures, noting that 
earlier expectations of a possible recession or economic softening later this 
year have all but evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the government's estimate of economic growth in the second 
quarter of 1989 was revised upward to an annual rate of 2.7% from a previous 
report of 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy looks very solid, with faster growth this quarter than last," said 
Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. Economic Advisers. "This is not a signal for a 
boom, but instead a very firm footing for the economy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcome Signal 
</P>
<P>
Sinai noted that the Labor Department report contained evidence that wage 
inflation is moderating: Average hourly wages dipped 1 cent in August, average 
weekly wages fell $2.29, and the average hours worked in the manufacturing 
sector declined 6 minutes a week. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hourly wage decline is a welcome signal that wages appear to be 
growing at about 4.5% a year -- a far slower rate than seemed likely last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems wage inflation has stabilized," he said. "What we are looking to is a 
strong economy in the third quarter, and so far inflation is performing well. 
There is no imminent recession, hardly even a slowdown, so the Fed will 
probably hold steady." 
</P>
<P>
Sinai suggested that if the Federal Reserve had known earlier this summer what 
it knows now, "it wouldn't have eased" interest rates as much as it did when 
recession fears were rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brinner of Data Resources, a Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm, 
said August's employment figures were less a signal of future activity than 
ratification of what was already known -- that the economy was more robust last 
spring than had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
"Jobs are not a leading indicator," Brinner said. "If anything, they lag, 
because people hire only after seeing if customers will buy what they have to 
offer. What this means is that there was no recession in the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Brinner said he expects wage inflation to reach a level of about 4% or 4.5% a 
year and remain steady. "We see no spiral, but rather a balance -- which we can 
sustain only with a moderate slowdown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Numbers Are a Non-Event' 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Assn. of Manufacturers, cited 
the August report as another sign that the economy is chugging ahead 
uneventfully at its own pace. 
</P>
<P>
"The employment numbers are a non-event," Richards said in a statement, noting 
that labor markets traditionally change little between July and August. 
</P>
<P>
Because the August strikes reduced estimated new employment by 108,000 jobs, 
Richards said, "job gains in September should pick up, provided the disputes 
are resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Following the pattern of recent years, most job creation in August was in the 
services sector, where 69,000 new payroll jobs were created. In the 
goods-producing sector, 20,000 jobs were added as striking coal miners returned 
to work. A decision by auto makers to recall about 25,000 workers previously 
laid off during spring and early-summer doldrums helped increase new factory 
employment by 11,000 jobs.

Judge Enters Judgment Against Hilton: A federal judge in Las Vegas entered a 
final judgment against Hilton Hotels Corp. of a jury award of $38.8 million for 
37 dealers and floor men fired from the Las Vegas Hilton in 1983. The jury 
awarded the money March 9 in a case in which the dealers and floor men claimed 
age and sex discrimination. The award, including attorneys fees and interest, 
has now climbed to $44.8 million. Hilton attorneys have 10 working days to file 
motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal. If those motions fail, 
the company could appeal the case to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco.

recreational and competition downhill skis. Anthony already owns the K2 and PRE 
ski brands. Terms were not revealed for the purchase of the Olin ski assets and 
the right to use the Olin name on skis and related products worldwide. Olin 
Ski, based in Middletown, Conn., has annual sales of about $10 million.

NLRB Rules in Favor of Pacific Lumber: Pacific Lumber Co., which has faced 
numerous legal and environmental challenges since it was bought by Maxxam Inc. 
in 1985, has won a key ruling against a group of workers trying to organize a 
buyout of the company. The National Labor Relations Board determined that 
federal labor laws do not protect employees who engage in activity to overthrow 
a company's management. Two employees of Pacific Lumber asked the NLRB to issue 
an unfair labor complaint against Pacific Lumber, which they said had punished 
them for trying to organize an employee stock ownership plan to buy the company 
from Maxxam and its chief executive, Charles Hurwitz.

Lyphomed Accepts Buyout Offer: Lyphomed Inc., the only company in the United 
States allowed to treat a pneumonia that is the leading cause of death in AIDS 
patients, said it accepted a sweetened buyout offer from a Japanese company at 
$31.87 a share. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. proposed Aug. 21 to buy all the 
shares of Lyphomed it does not already own at $31 a share. The sweetened 
proposal values Lyphomed at $956.1 million, up from $930 million previously. 
Fujisawa already owns 30% of the Melrose, Ill.-based drug company. Earlier this 
year, the government allowed the company to sell pentamadine in an aerosol can 
to treat pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

MIKE DOWNEY: ANOTHER MAJOR LOSS FOR BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angels this day weep, and Padres and Cardinals pray, and Braves feel weak, 
Giants small, Reds blue. 
</P>
<P>
Now, both Pete Rose and Bart Giamatti are out of the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
We thought nothing could be sadder than the banishment of Rose. We were wrong. 
The commissioner of baseball is dead, felled Friday by a heart attack. May the 
pennants of 1989 fly at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
Life begins, life ends. Two days before Bart Giamatti oversaw Pete Rose's 
expulsion from baseball, Rose became the father of a baby girl. Ten days later, 
Giamatti passed away. Such are the days of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe any of this. Hard to believe that Giamatti the graybeard, at 
51, was only three years older than the moptop Rose. Hard to believe that one 
moment a man can step up before the crowd and take his cuts, then be seen no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Giamatti was there one day and gone the next. Gone in the snap of a 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
History books ask us to believe that the day before he was assassinated, Julius 
Caesar, dining with friends, was asked: "What is the best kind of death?" 
</P>
<P>
"A sudden one," Caesar was said to have replied. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Perhaps leaders of men should never linger, should die in combat, 
should spare their followers any undue suffering or anxiety. Mere days after 
winning his greatest battle, Bart Giamatti collapsed at his New England summer 
home and, less than two hours later, at a Martha's Vineyard hospital, was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
He had crusaded to keep baseball "from blemish or stain or disgrace," to quote 
the commissioner's words on the day Pete Rose's side was retired. "No 
individual is superior to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Only since April had A. Bartlett Giamatti been baseball's commissioner, its 
seventh. Before that, he was president of the National League, and before that, 
president of Yale, an educator, a man of letters, a "man of principle," as Yale 
football Coach Carmen Cozza remembered him Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Cosell, who taught classes at Yale when he wasn't in a broadcast booth, 
called Giamatti "one of the most learned and remarkable men I have ever known, 
and a great asset for this country." 
</P>
<P>
How robust Bart Giamatti seemed when he spoke in public, when he shouldered the 
weight of having to investigate and castigate one of his favorite players in 
his favorite sport. He never hid, never quaked. Behind billy-goatish Van Dyke 
whiskers that added age to his face was the voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's faithful, ready to endorse Pete Rose no matter what the cause or 
who the foe, did everything from hang the commissioner in effigy to vilify him 
in banner and verse. He became Black Bart to backers of the Reds, a varmint 
instead of a sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, they turned me into the villain," Giamatti said one day. "A 
remarkable act of transference." 
</P>
<P>
He scarcely had time to enjoy his eventual victory, even though it was the kind 
of victory, a Pyrrhic one, as a Yalie might choose to call it, that had proved 
costly to both sides. Kicking Pete Rose out of baseball was not the triumph for 
which Bart Giamatti hoped to be remembered. It was a sad occasion, not a joyful 
one. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't always know what to make of the man. He could be haughty, 
condescending, imperious. In this respect he was much like the original chief 
judge of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who, by coincidence and apropos of 
nothing, was the only other commissioner to have died in office. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball had need of a sturdy figurehead, however. Bowie Kuhn, rightly or 
wrongly, had been perceived as a marshmallow, and Peter Ueberroth as a 
profiteer, a man who did more for baseball's economy than for its integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, in five months, put his personal imprint on the game, as a league 
president does on the baseballs themselves. Everybody knew where he stood. He 
had nothing to gain in the Pete Rose affair, and much to lose. He inherited 
this mess and did so willingly, and knew next that he faced an equally riveting 
challenge, the potential of a 1990 labor strike that could put his sport in an 
even more unfavorable light. 
</P>
<P>
"Let no one think that it did not hurt baseball," Giamatti said of the Rose 
scandal. "That hurt will pass, however, as the great glory of the game asserts 
itself and a resilient institution goes forward." 
</P>
<P>
He was right in every respect but one. 
</P>
<P>
One resilient institution does not go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's losses have begun to outnumber its wins.

<P>
COMMISSIONER PRAISED FOR UNWAVERING DISPLAY OF COURAGE, INTEGRITY

Shock was the obvious reaction in baseball Friday to the sudden death of 
Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ueberroth, Giamatti's predecessor, was vacationing in Paris when informed 
of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finest commissioner in 
history," he said, in a statement released by his Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart Giamatti encompassed everything that is good and enduring about America's 
favorite pastime. For this man of words, courage and deeds . . . no words can 
express the loss." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner Francis T. (Fay) Vincent Jr. had spent Friday morning with 
Giamatti, who died Friday afternoon after collapsing at his summer home in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous shock," Vincent said. "I dropped him off at noon and he 
seemed OK. He had great friends and admirers. Baseball, his family, his 
friends, the country suffered a big loss. This was a uniquely talented man. 
It's a very sad event, a tragedy for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Former commissioner Bowie Kuhn, in a statement released by a spokeswoman from 
his New York law office, described Giamatti as a man of varied talents. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a man of extraordinary character," he said. "He blended together such a 
remarkable combination of virtues -- eloquence, intellectuality, patience, 
fair-mindedness, humor, prudence and courage. He surely would have been one of 
the great commissioners had he served on." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, president of Yale University in 1978-1985 before becoming president 
of the National League in 1986, was remembered by his Yale successor. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave of himself magnificently to Yale as a teacher, a scholar and a 
leader," said Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. "This university will be a better place 
because of his service. . . . He will never be forgotten at this university." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger President Peter O'Malley, in a statement released by the Dodgers, said 
he was "deeply saddened." 
</P>
<P>
"We will always remember his great love for the game of baseball. Our thoughts 
and prayers go with the Giamatti family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley is in the Soviet Union, attending the dedication of a baseball 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great shock to me," said Angel owner Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of respect for him -- I found him to be honorable, very smart and 
very fair. In my opinion, he would have been one of the great commissioners." 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called Giamatti "brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been other men who have wanted to be commissioner because of what 
the office represented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart, however, wanted to be commissioner because of his love for the game. . . 
. When we lose Bart Giamatti, we lose a man this country could never replace. 
He was brilliant and compassionate . . . it left me dumbstruck." 
</P>
<P>
A.B. (Happy) Chandler, 91-year-old former baseball commissioner (1945-1951) and 
two-term U.S. senator, reacted similarly. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I'm shocked," he said, from his Lexington, Ky., home. "I've always 
felt Bowie Kuhn was the best one (commissioner) we ever had, and Ueberroth was 
a good one, too, but Giamatti just wasn't around long enough (to be compared). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
Said National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle: "He was a man of many 
talents, one of which (handling the Rose case) he proved during his few short 
months as commissioner," he said. "I admired the man and the manner in which he 
conducted himself during his all-too brief time in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, remembered Giamatti as serving a 
game he loved. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to know Bart during his time as National League president, and the thing 
I think of is his great love for the game. . . . He was very excited about the 
opportunity that had come his way to serve the game. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was a man who, along with that love, also brought an intelligence to 
the game. Although his term of service proved to be short, he showed all the 
strengths he had in that time." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Port, executive vice-president of the Angels, said Giamatti spelled the 
game with a capital "G." 
</P>
<P>
"Having heard him talk about the Game -- and by 'the Game' I mean with a 
capital G -- I could tell the Game was special to him. He reminded us of the 
grace and beauty and atmosphere this game has. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an incredibly bright individual. But he was a very gentle and 
compassionate man, also. He'll be missed." 
</P>
<P>
John Ziegler, commissioner of the National Hockey League, paid tribute to 
Giamatti's handling of the Pete Rose affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Every commissioner's heaviest responsibility is the occasional but serious 
challenge to the integrity of the sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner Giamatti was called early to exercise this responsibility. He 
stood firm against the challenge, exercised his responsibility, and all of us 
in sports are the better for it." 
</P>

PRINCESS ANNE IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
BUT ANITA DEFRANTZ HAS IOC TALKING ABOUT PROPOSED STEROIDS BAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are only six women among the 93 members of the International Olympic 
Committee, but two of them were at the center of attention on the final day 
Friday of the IOC's annual session. 
</P>
<P>
Every move made by Great Britain's Princess Anne, the president of the 
International Equestrian Federation who became an IOC member last year, was 
duly noted by 80 members of the British press, who descended upon Puerto Rico 
after word surfaced this week of her separation from husband Mark Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Security prevented reporters and photographers from following her onto an 
elevator. But when the elevator door did not close, they shouted questions and 
snapped pictures from afar. 
</P>
<P>
While the princess waited patiently, a hotel engineer was unsuccessful in 
getting the elevator doors to close. But when the princess stepped forward to 
leave the elevator, the door suddenly closed in her face. 
</P>
<P>
The busiest person at the IOC's headquarters hotel Friday was the travel agent, 
who was trying to arrange trips for the reporters to Belize, where the princess 
will go this weekend on behalf of her Save the Children Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles caused a stir that was more closely related to 
IOC business with her proposal to ban athletes who test positive for anabolic 
steroids at the Olympics from competing in future Games. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also called for strict sanctions against administrators, coaches, 
doctors and trainers who assist athletes in using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC referred the proposal to its medical commission for further study but 
not until 23 members had addressed the subject during Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good discussion," DeFrantz said. "I hope some real solid 
proposals come from it. At least, people are talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch echoed the statement earlier in the week 
by the medical commission chairman, Prince Alexander de Merode of Belgium, that 
athletes should not be suspended for life for a first offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree in principle with the proposal by Ms. DeFrantz," Samaranch said. 
"After a very long debate, we decided that we will try to increase the 
sanctions regarding doping. But they will be mainly against the people 
surrounding the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
The IOC now allows the governing bodies for the sports in the Games to 
establish their own eligibility rules. Most federations suspend athletes for 
two years for initial drug offenses but have vague rules regarding 
collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
Two new members elected Friday to the IOC were Walther Troeger of West Germany 
and Fernando Ferreira Lima Bello of Portugal.

CRAWFORD CONVICTED OF THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Crawford, son of the former Dodger of the same name and a highly 
regarded UCLA football player who was dropped from the team this week, was 
convicted of theft Aug. 22 in Beverly Hills Municipal Court, court records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, 19, was sentenced to 24 months' summary probation and ordered to pay 
a fine of $352.50. As part of a plea bargain to the misdemeanor charge, he was 
ordered by the court to pay $1,494.30 to Nordstrom department store and $298 to 
Lisa Papetti, a UCLA student. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UCLA announced Friday that Damion Lyons, a junior cornerback from 
Berkeley, has been suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons and teammate Roman Phifer, a junior linebacker from Pineville, N.C., face 
misdemeanor battery charges in the beating last May of a fellow student. Phifer 
also has been suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the Crawford case, Papetti reported to UCLA police on June 7 that a backpack 
containing her belongings, including a checkbook and several credit cards, had 
been stolen from outside a campus cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
On June 12, Crawford was detained by Beverly Hills police officers, who found 
in his wallet Papetti's driver's license and a credit card issued to her. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that a forged check drawn on Papetti's account was used to pay for 
a pizza that was delivered on June 7 to a dorm room shared by Crawford and 
teammate Kerry Ferrell, a freshman split end from Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Also, said Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox, charges totaling $1,494.30 were 
made on Papetti's account between June 7-12 at a Nordstrom department store in 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who could not be reached for comment, paid Nordstrom that amount on 
the day of his sentencing last month, according to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors explained that under the summary probation agreement, Crawford will 
not be under supervision of a probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
A three-sport star at Beverly Hills High, Crawford came to UCLA as a high 
school football All-American. After red-shirting last season, he threatened 
last spring to overtake Eric Turner, a returning starter, and move into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's father, who retired from baseball in 1977, compiled a .268 lifetime 
batting average in 14 major league seasons, including 12 with the Dodgers.

GIAMATTI'S REORGANIZATION BEING PUT TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bart Giamatti, who died Friday after only five months as baseball's seventh 
commissioner, may have made it easier for the game to select an interim 
successor by his reorganization of the commissioner's office in April. 
</P>
<P>
The key provision of the reorganization was the appointment of a deputy 
commissioner to serve as a Giamatti liason and supervise the corporate, 
licensing and broadcasting divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti selected a longtime friend, Francis T. (Fay) Vincent Jr., an attorney 
and former chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures 
Industries, Inc., as well as the senior vice president of the Coca-Cola 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, an important intermediary in the gambling investigation of former 
Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose and well versed in the daily workings of the 
commissioner's office, would seem to be a logical choice to serve as interim 
commissioner, accelerating the often fractious and lengthy search for a 
fulltime successor. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball rules provide that in the event of a commissioner's death, the 
Executive Council takes over the game's operation. The Executive Council is 
composed of American League President Bobby Brown, National League President 
Bill White and four club owners from each league. 
</P>
<P>
The National League representatives are Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers, Bill 
Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies, John McMullen of the Houston Astros and 
Douglas Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The American League representatives are Jim Campbell of the Detroit Tigers, 
Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Haywood Sullivan of the Boston Red 
Sox. George Argyros was also a member of the council before selling the Seattle 
Mariners last week. A replacement for Argyros has yet to be selected. 
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council's first order of business will be to select an interim 
commissioner. Vincent is not automatic. His position was created by Giamatti 
and is not specificed in the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The rules permit the selection of a commissioner pro tem for a term not to 
exceed three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine we'll be on the phone soon," Reinsdorf said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
An owners' meeting, already scheduled for Sept. 13-14 in Milwaukee, will also 
focus on the question of an interim and fulltime successor, a spokesman for the 
commissioner's office said. The selection of a fulltime successor requires the 
majority approval of the 26 owners. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent is the immediate candidate for both jobs, though his comparative 
anonymity and penchant for behind-the-scenes roles could work against him. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the shock of Giamatti's sudden death, there were only a few names being 
mentioned Friday as potential successors. 
</P>
<P>
League presidents White and Brown are possibilities, with White being a 
minority candidate at a time when baseball is stressing affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, who headed the search committees that 
nominated both Giamatti and predecessor Peter Ueberroth and who was considered 
a candidate himself, may again receive support. 
</P>
<P>
Selig's general manager, Harry Dalton; New York Mets President Frank Cashen, 
and Oakland Athletics Vice President Sandy Alderson were among the first wave 
of baseball names to emerge. The election of Ueberroth and Giamatti, however, 
showed a willingness on the owners' part to go outside the game for 
personalities with strong images and credentials in other areas. Will it happen 
again? On a sad Friday, no one seemed in a mood to weigh that possibility.

DEPUTY COMMISSIONER DISLIKES PUBLICITY

<P>
The man who may run major league baseball after the death of Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti is Deputy Commissioner Francis T. (Fay) Vincent Jr., the shy attorney 
and former head of Columbia Pictures who conducted some of the negotiating that 
resulted in the banning of Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Although baseball owners will choose Giamatti's successor, Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner told a New York TV station that he will press for Vincent's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what Bart would have wanted," Steinbrenner said. "I'm voting for him. 
When we lose Bart Giamatti, we lose a man we can never replace. Even Fay would 
say that." 
</P>
<P>
As did Giamatti, Vincent took office on April 1. Erudite and scholarly like his 
predecessor, Vincent, a history buff, has been known to call prominent people 
to ask them about their roles in history-making situations. But unlike his 
friend, Vincent prefers to stay in the background. Some would even describe him 
as bland. 
</P>
<P>
When he was with Columbia Pictures, Vincent spent more time in New York than in 
Hollywood, and said earlier this year, "I was reasonably invisible, if not 
anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
Said Steve Greenberg, an attorney who specializes in representing athletes and 
is a longtime friend of Vincent: "There's no question that after (Peter) 
Ueberroth and Giamatti, he has a very different media image. But it goes to 
what you want in a commissioner. Do you want flash and dash? Then Fay's not 
your guy. If you want substance and a job done well, Fay's your guy." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent and Giamatti became friends more than a dozen years ago. When Giamatti 
asked Vincent to join him in baseball last fall, Giamatti said, "I was looking 
for someone with the background and skills complementary to my own. It occurred 
to me that I had a friend who fit the bill. Then an owner said to me, 'Have you 
thought of Fay Vincent?' " 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, 51, is heavy-set, wears dark-rimmed glasses and speaks quietly and 
precisely. His nickname, Fay, is short for Francis in Irish communities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent walks with difficulty, aided by a cane. As an 18-year-old freshman at 
Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., he was locked in his room as a prank 
and the only way out, he believed, was through the window and along a ledge to 
another room. But the ledge was icy and he fell four stories, breaking his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The injury did not deter him from the legal path he had set for himself. After 
graduation from Yale Law School, he practiced corporate law for 15 years with 
firms in New York and Washington. For four months in 1978, he served as 
associate director of corporate finance for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in June 1978, he was called by investment banker Herbert Allen, a friend 
who had been two years behind him at Williams. Allen wanted him to join 
Columbia Pictures Industries, which Allen's family investment firm, Allen &amp; 
Co., controlled. Columbia was suffering from the embezzlement scandal 
surrounding then-studio chief David Begelman. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia board of directors was about to oust president Alan Hirschfield 
and Allen wanted Vincent to take over. Vincent's unfamiliarity with the film 
and TV business was deemed a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows him," Allen was quoted as saying in the book, "Indecent 
Exposure." "Nobody can lay a glove on him. We need a Judge Landis." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the challenge was worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 40," he said recently. "Herbert said, 'What do you have to lose? Nobody 
expects you to succeed, and if you fail you go back to being a lawyer. If you 
succeed, you'll have a lot of fun and make a lot of money.' So I had to try 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded by most standards. He helped re-establish Columbia's credibility 
and ended the company's political strife; positioned Columbia for Coca-Cola's 
$750-million acquisition in 1982, and presided over the acquisition of Merv 
Griffin Enterprises for $200 million, Embassy Communications for $267 million 
and Tandem Productions for $178 million. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his most-publicized moves, Vincent hired flamboyant British producer 
David Puttnam to run Columbia in 1986, but Puttnam, an outsider harshly 
critical of the Hollywood Establishment, was gone only a year later, having 
offended top Columbia stars such as Bill Cosby and Bill Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we'd done it over again, we'd have done things differently," said 
Vincent. "But I think it was terrific to break out of the usual mold and hire 
someone different." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent was also on board when Columbia released the Warren Beatty-Dustin 
Hoffman flop, "Ishtar." 
</P>
<P>
In a decade at Columbia and then Coca-Cola, Vincent rose to become executive 
vice president of Coca-Cola and president of its Entertainment Business Sector. 
In late 1987, he was shifted to running Coca-Cola's bottling-company 
investments. He left in July 1988 to return to his old law firm, Caplin &amp; 
Drysdale. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent began working with Giamatti and Ueberroth for several months before 
taking office. His experience was put to use during negotiations for the new 
CBS and ESPN network and cable television agreements, which go into effect next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that the switch to baseball was more in line with his own 
interests, which do not include much of movies or TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying subject matter of television and movies is not something I had 
a passion about," he said. "But all my life, I've been addicted to baseball. 
That makes a difference."

A few days ago, Bart Giamatti telephoned George Bush at the President's retreat 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Bush just missed the call from the baseball commissioner but knew what his 
longtime friend and fellow Yale University graduate wanted to talk about: Pete 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I had not commented on it but I have talked to him at great length about it," 
Bush said Friday, shortly after Giamatti's death. "I told him I'd like to, just 
as a baseball fan, know the aftermath, know exactly how this matter had been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not an easy matter for him. But all through that, I was thinking of 
the difficulty that he had in setting these standards that high and staying 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush called Giamatti's death a tragedy. "A young, certainly by my standards, 
man. And just a wonderful person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart was a close friend of mine for many, many years. I just want to pay my 
respects. He loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a real 
contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible ethical standards."

increased risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the General Accounting Office was based on 15 studies of steroid 
use in the United States. One study found that 6.6% of male high school seniors 
have used steroids, and a different study found that between 15% and 20% of 
college athletes have used steroids.

Nebraska because of allegations made about the school's football program in the 
book, "The Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" by former Sports 
Illustrated writer Armen Keteyian. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen it, and anything is possible," said Berst. "But we looked into 
everything when we were investigating Nebraska in 1986. And those matters -- 
the ticket-selling by players and the question of car ownership by Doug DuBose 
-- are closed and will stay that way."

'BATMAN' RATED NOT-FOR-KIDS IN BELGIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Batman," the Warner Bros. blockbuster that has been breaking box office 
records all over the world, has been rated "Children Not Allowed" in Belgium, 
the Associated Press reported Friday. But Warner Bros. officials said the 
company intends to fight the restrictive rating in court before the movie, 
which was rated PG-13 in the United States, opens in Belgium on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's rating decision bans everybody under 16 from the movie and is 
expected to cut ticket sales by 30% -- meaning a loss of hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, according to Bruno Mertens, general manager of Warner Bros. 
Belgium. Batman has already raked in more than $230 million in the U.S. alone, 
and just this week it broke the record for the largest first-day take of any 
movie in the history of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"A movie like James Bond gets an 'All Ages' tag while Batman is 'Children Not 
Allowed,' " Mertens said. "That is beyond comprehension for any professional 
who saw both movies." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry committee wrote that "Batman," which stars Michael Keaton 
as the caped crusader and Jack Nicholson as the Joker, "exuded a general 
atmosphere of violence," Mertens said. The ministry compared "Batman" with "A 
Clockwork Orange," Stanley Kubrick's 1971 cult classic that contained explicit 
violence, profanity and sex.

ABC UNIT DEVELOPING PAIR OF SHOWS FOR NBC

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's new television production arm is developing two shows for NBC, apparently 
marking the first time one network has agreed to create programming for 
another. 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed programs is a miniseries and the other a series, said 
Brandon Stoddard, the former ABC Entertainment president who now heads the 
fledgling ABC Productions unit. He said no firm deals have been made to produce 
the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The in-house production division has 18 projects in development, Stoddard said 
at a Century City news conference Friday, with a miniseries and two movies in 
the works for HBO, two movies in development for the Lifetime cable network, 
which is partially owned by Capital Cities/ABC, and the rest slated for ABC.

PRACTICING THE ART OF SCIENCE PROGRAMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without the budget of a "National Geographic" special or a "Nature" series, it 
isn't easy to produce science programs interesting enough to engage a national 
audience, even one that normally tunes to public television. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted -- and on a relative shoe string -- the University of California 
system has come with a new series called "An Open Window," showcasing research 
at each of the nine University of California branches in a half-hour magazine 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday at 1 p.m., the first two of five episodes will air on the 
Discovery cable channel. The others will run at various times through Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine contributed two segments. The first, on the effect political 
candidates' appearances have on how people vote, will be shown Sept. 11 at 1 
p.m. and again Sept. 11 at 9 a.m. The second, on laser surgery for pets, will 
be shown Sept. 18 at 1 and again Sept. 20 at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A second series of five episodes is in production and awaiting an air date from 
the commercial cable system, which reaches an estimated 43 million households. 
</P>
<P>
"Open Window" grew out of a weekly cable program of the same name, developed by 
the Television Service of UC Berkeley, aimed at explaining the university's 
research to surrounding communities in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis is on practical applications," Robert Cremer, one of the show's 
founders, said in a telephone interview. "Things that have the potential for 
affecting people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy series of meetings, Cremer said, public affairs people from the 
various UC campuses decided to try to "reach a national audience in a 
cost-effective way" with a single, systemwide program. Since "no one campus can 
produce enough quality programming," Cremer said, each branch -- plus the 
Lawrence Livermore Lab -- would take responsibility for 1-3 segments in the 
pilot series, sometimes collaborating with such outside institutions as NASA 
and Caltech. Each segment would last 3 to 6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Public affairs departments at the UC branches, faced with producing the 
segments on a budget of $2,000-$3,000, had no choice but to make extensive use 
of university resources and to be innovative. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Colleen Bentley-Adler, associate director communications at UC 
Irvine, wanted to do the segment on the use of laser surgery on pets at the 
university's Beckman Laser Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than a straight report explaining the surgery and the institute's plans 
for the world's first laser veterinary hospital, using someone from the 
university as an unseen narrator, Bentley-Adler tried to think in television 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Lassie! 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Palladium Entertainment, which controls rights to the original 
"Lassie" television series, she found an episode in which Lassie was injured 
(not difficult, she said, "Lassie was always getting hurt") and needed 
specialized surgery that could be performed, says Lassie's vet gravely, only by 
"a research veterinarian connected with the state college." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler also contacted the Screen Actors Guild, which put her in touch 
with actress June Lockhart, one of several moms on the series, and hired 
Lockhart to host the segment. Bentley-Adler wrote and directed the 4-minute 
tape, which was shot and edited by UCI's media services department with post 
production done by an outside company. 
</P>
<P>
With the 40-second "Lassie" clip setting things up, and Lockhart narrating, the 
piece neatly segues from Lassie to lasers. The new technology is demonstrated 
on a poodle with a cancerous tumor on its hind leg, severe enough that, without 
the surgery, the dog would have had to be put to sleep. The result: good TV and 
a healthy plug for the university. 
</P>
<P>
At least two more segments from UCI are planned for the second series, 
Bentley-Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical half hour in the first series is made up of five segments, knit 
together by introductions by anchors Teri Bond Michael of UCLA and Paul 
Pfotenhauer of UC Davis, both of whom worked in television before joining their 
schools' public affairs departments. The pair opens each half hour on a 
different campus, offering introductions to each segment from that campus along 
with running descriptions of the UC branch. 
</P>
<P>
Cremer, who produces the series, calls these "the last vestige of the 
university public affairs perspective umbilical" and he hopes they will be 
eliminated once each campus in the system gets a turn. 
</P>
<P>
Cremer's original goal was to place the series on PBS (where most of those 
associated with the project assumed it would end up), but with the exception of 
a few smaller stations in California, he found that officials were wary of 
material put together by public affairs departments. 
</P>
<P>
Cremer said this was a valid concern and he did everything he could to keep the 
puffery to a minimum. Writers from various campuses attended a seminar 
instructing them in how to make their material "informational rather than 
promotional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his efforts, the PBS network turned the series down. Ultimately, Cremer 
turned to the all-documentary Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a look at it and found it a very credible piece of TV," said Greg 
Moyer, Discovery's senior vice president for programming. "It explored a 
worthwhile area of topics in science and technology (and we decided) it would 
probably work for us." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer did say that, in order for the series to break into prime time, "we might 
have slightly tougher editorial standards," as well as even more stringent 
requirements for technical quality. 
</P>
<P>
Cremer's dream is to make the series truly national, with a regular time slot 
and with state university systems around the country contributing enough 
segments to air a new program each week. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Discovery is concerned, that is a viable goal. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer said "there is a lot of demand for science and technology programming 
from a wide variety of advertisers, and not just from those marketing 
scientific products like computers. 
</P>
<P>
"The more ecumenical it becomes, the more attractive it would be to a network 
such as ours, which would not want to become captive of any one institution," 
Moyer said.

If you believe a race track is the only place to see horse and rider combine in 
a spectacular display of speed, strength and beauty, you've been heading down 
the wrong trail, pardner. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably more horse shows featuring more different breeds, riding 
styles and competitions in Southern California than any other place in the 
country," said Corey Walkey, owner of Mill Creek Stables in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of them are free or open to the public for a minimal charge. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, which hosted the equestrian events in 
the 1984 Olympics, can take much of the credit for boosting attendance at the 
horse shows with which it may one day directly compete. (Gov. George Deukmejian 
has signed into law a bill that would allow parimutuel betting on match 
jumping, steeplechase racing and barrel racing, the latter a speed event around 
three barrels on a clover-shaped course.) 
</P>
<P>
"People saw world-class competition and got really excited by what they saw," 
said David Schmutz, manager of the Paddock Riding Club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't just wishful thinking on the part of local riding schools, 
equestrian centers, tack shops and general purveyors of horse flesh, who stand 
to gain most by the surging interest in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Association Membership Grew 
</P>
<P>
According to Kathy Fallon, secretary for the American Horse Shows Assn. (ASHA) 
-- largest multibreed equestrian organization in the United States -- 
membership in the association grew from 34,000 members in 1980 to about 53,000 
members in 1989. Moreover, the group anticipates it will sanction 2,500 shows 
in 1990, up from 1,270 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few sports around where men and women compete equally," Fallon 
said. "Also, I can't think of a sport that attracts people with such a wide 
diversity of backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
Walkey's stable of riders during the recent three-day horse trials at Showpark 
in Del Mar revealed not only a rich variety of competitors in the combined 
dressage, cross-country and stadium jumping events but also a glimpse into why 
many of them risk life and limb to vie for a blue ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
In the first day of the competition, Amy Bittner, a UCLA law student from Mill 
Creek Stables, was equal to the dressage challenge, in which the horse is 
judged on a series of ballet-like movements and gaits that can best be compared 
to the compulsory figures in ice skating. However, on Day 2 in the 
cross-country portion, which tests horse and rider over a series of jumps and 
obstacles in the open field, Bittner booked a much rougher passage. 
</P>
<P>
"For a split second, I thought I was going down," Bittner said after returning 
to the barn. "Then I looked down and saw all the rocks and sort of changed my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bittner had a chance to preview the course with some of the other Mill 
Creek Stable riders, the horse is seeing the trail for the first time. To 
horses with limited reasoning powers but long memories, a 4-inch puddle may 
seem like a 4-foot-deep lake or lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
To successfully execute all the jumps requires a blind obedience on the part of 
the horse that only the rider can convey to his mount after hours of practice 
and training. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it takes 20 falls before you're even considered a rider," said Mark 
Watring, a professional trainer and rider for 17 years who was stabled next to 
the Mill Creek contingent. 
</P>
<P>
Walkey wasn't quite so fatalistic: "For me to be able to send my riders out and 
watch them compete, I have to feel they're going to come back in one piece," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Graham, a Los Angeles architect, also experienced some rocky moments on 
the course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harder Than It Looks' 
</P>
<P>
"The cross-country phase is significantly harder than it looks," she said. 
"I've been a serious swimmer, tennis player, runner and all those other things, 
and I'd say it's more work than all of them put together." 
</P>
<P>
Then why do it? 
</P>
<P>
For Graham's stablemate, Janice Romersa -- who lives in Hidden Hills with her 
husband, a television producer, and two children -- riding is the fulfillment 
of a childhood fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents could never really afford to buy me a horse," she said, "so when I 
had the money, I took the leap. Also, it's good for me. Sometimes I think I 
should stop doing this, but I'm afraid of the alternative -- turning into a 
blimp." 
</P>
<P>
Because of creeping arthritis in her hands, Romersa does allow for a few 
shortcuts. "I pay others to braid my horse; it's real sad, I know, but it keeps 
me going." 
</P>
<P>
For Cindy Wilson of Altadena, riding is almost an obsession. "We're all 
suffering from pre-senile dementia," she said. "We don't remember how scared we 
are when we're actually out there riding." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Don, a pilot, had another explanation. "Before the event, she's 
tongue-tied, but once on the course, the exhilaration propels her and the horse 
forward," he said. "After she comes off, she's so pumped with adrenaline, she's 
ready to go back out again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wilson's oblique view of the sport had several of the other riders 
and even her trainer nodding their heads in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Consider that for every 30% of your time you're on the horse, you're spending 
the other 70% taking care of your tack (equipment such as halter, bridle, 
saddle, etc.) and your animal," Walkey emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to time, there is also the expense to consider. A good show horse 
may run $10,000 and above, be it a "warm blood" (referring to the high-strung 
temperament of the horse) like an Arabian or thoroughbred, or one of the color 
breeds like a pinto, palomino or appaloosa. Another eye-opener is the price of 
a saddle, which can range from $500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are boarding, training, veterinarian, vanning and farrier 
(horseshoer) costs each month, not to mention the outlay for riding attire such 
as boots, chaps, breeches and riding helmet or hat. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to run at least $1,000 a month, and that's if you're just competing 
once a month," Walkey said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an addiction," Bittner said squarely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Plus Side 
</P>
<P>
But there's also a huge upside to this expensive habit, which each day is 
attracting more converts and spectators to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I have parents who come and complain at first about having to buy a horse, 
drive to the barn every day and go through all the hassle and expense," Walkey 
said, "and then about a year later, they are so delighted to see the tremendous 
change that's come over their children." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Braun, chairman of the Orange County Horse Shows Assn. in 1988, believes 
you have a better chance learning about responsibility and discipline at your 
local stable than the neighborhood penny arcade. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids don't have time to get into trouble," said Braun, whose two 
daughters, Heather and Jennifer, ride. "Horses always need something, and the 
people who train them pretty much have to follow the same schedule. The bottom 
line is they're actually caring about another life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Just the Well-Heeled 
</P>
<P>
Participating in horse shows needn't be confined to the well-heeled set. Many 
of the riders earn the money they need to compete by mucking out stalls, 
cleaning tack, serving as hotwalkers or doing one of several other chores 
around the barn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equine Events 
</P>
<P>
While it seems there is a horse show going on virtually every weekend from Coto 
de Caza to Santa Barbara, September happens to be an exceptional month to see 
your favorite breed or equine event. 
</P>
<P>
Next weekend, the historic Empty Saddle Club on the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
hosts the 32nd annual Portuguese Bend National Horse Show, which should please 
both the casual spectator and well-versed equestrian. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 English hunter and jumper classes (hunters are judged on the style 
and manner with which they go over the fences, whereas jumpers compete against 
the clock in their effort to complete the obstacle course) will be featured in 
the top-rated competition. 
</P>
<P>
Held in a distinctive country-fair atmosphere, the show also will offer a "Kids 
Korral," featuring pony rides, colorful crafts, face painting and a wide 
variety of refreshments served from decorated booths. 
</P>
<P>
Next Saturday's special events will include the Medieval Times jousting team, 
re-creating 11th-Century tournament games and battlefield maneuvers in the 
clubhouse arena. Elegant horsemanship will be demonstrated in the dressage 
performance, featuring the Andalusian "Ambassador of Valencia." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Galloping Gossips of the Imperial Valley will perform square 
dancing on horseback, and "Malibu Faunetta," a Morgan horse from Malibu, will 
prance a musical "kur" to the rhythm of "42nd Street." 
</P>
<P>
(To reach the Empty Saddle Club, exit Interstate 110 at Pacific Coast Highway 
and travel north about two miles to Century Boulevard. Make a left and continue 
to Rolling Hills Road. Proceed about a quarter mile to 39 Empty Saddle Road in 
Rolling Hills Estates.) 
</P>
<P>
The following weekend, Sept. 16-17, the Coto de Caza Equestrian Center will be 
center ring for the Orange County Horse Show Assn.'s annual Championship Show. 
There will be at least 60 championships at stake, including a junior/amateur 
hunter classic and several medal equitation events that judge the performance 
of the rider more than the horse itself. 
</P>
<P>
Other hoopla will include a watermelon-eating contest, chili cook-off and the 
IDS Financial Services $10,000 high jump, teaming horse and rider. A contest 
for miniature horses will round out the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children; 5 and younger are free. 
</P>
<P>
(To reach the Center at 1 Coto de Caza Drive, exit El Toro Road from Interstate 
405 -- the San Diego Freeway -- and head east to Santa Marguerita Parkway. Turn 
right and proceed to Live Oak Canyon Road. Make another right and continue to 
the entrance of the gated community. Inform the attendant that you've come to 
see the show.) 
</P>
<P>
Another highly rated horse show will be the Los Angeles International Jumping 
Festival, Sept. 23-24, at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. Scheduled events 
include the $30,000 Hermes Grand Prix, a level of show jumping matched only by 
the Olympics, and the Rolex/United States Equestrian Team Western Regional, 
which tests riders on the flat and through a series of regular and 
gymnastic-style jumps. General admission is $8; reserved seating is $25. 
</P>
<P>
(To reach the center at 4561 Cartwright Ave. in North Hollywood, exit 
Interstate 5 at Alameda Avenue in Burbank and go west to Main Street. Make a 
left and continue one block.) 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, you can attend the Arabian horse exhibition at California State 
Polytechnic University at Pomona, partaking in a tradition begun by cereal 
magnate W. K. Kellogg in the late 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Talented students and staff ride the Arabians, demonstrating the beauty and 
versatility of the breed known as the aristocrat of the desert and the 
progenitor of all modern light horse breeds such as the thoroughbred, American 
Saddlebred and quarter horse. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations include the Arabian as a jumper, driven under harness, vaulting 
(gymnastics on horseback), and working as both an English and Western horse. 
Remember that in English-style events, the horses walk, trot and canter; in 
Western they walk, jog and lope. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators are expected to especially enjoy the trick routines of Beezar, a 
highly animated Arabian that smiles, pushes a baby carriage, sits in a rocking 
horse, picks up a coin out of a water bucket and rings it up in a register. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit the Stables 
</P>
<P>
After each performance, visitors are invited to view the stable area and 
Kellogg Room, where numerous trophies and memorabilia are preserved, including 
the red saddle used by Rudolph Valentino in the "Son of Sheik." Also, be sure 
to check the foal pole for a pink or blue flag, indicating whether a new 
Arabian has been born at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions are held on the first Sunday each month, October through June, at 2 
p.m. Admission is $2 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and $1 for children, 6-17. 
</P>
<P>
(To reach Cal Poly, 3801 W. Temple Ave., Pomona, exit Interstate 10 -- the San 
Bernardino Freeway -- at Kellogg Drive, which will take you directly onto the 
campus.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Arabian lovers can get a sneak preview of their favorite breed Sept. 
18-20 in the Carnation Ring at the Los Angeles County Fair at Fairplex in 
Pomona. For the first time in its history, the W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse 
Center will duplicate its Sunday show as part of its ongoing outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the smaller or less-rated shows listed below may offer as much color 
and appeal as the larger shows. For example, you may comfortably wander through 
the barn area and talk with trainers and riders between events at such shows. 
Or, as in the recent cases of the horse trials at Showpark in San Diego, 
spectators were able to go out on the cross-country course amid the streams, 
oak trees and wild brush and take photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 9-10 -- Passport Series Horse Show. Showpark, 2847 Via de la Valle, Del 
Mar. For younger riders looking to move up. For information call (619)

information call (818) 854-2370. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sept. 16-17 -- Antelope Valley Arabian Horse Show. Antelope Valley Fairgrounds,

L.A. JURIES DON'T MIRROR POPULACE, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Legal Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official in charge of assembling jurors for Los Angeles courts said juries 
here do not adequately reflect community diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing well in terms of (reflecting diversity) in race, gender and 
ethnicity," said Raymond F. Arce, senior director of special operations for the 
Superior Court, "but not well with respect to age and economic status." 
</P>
<P>
Arce said the system is drawing more and more heavily from the ranks of the 
middle-aged and from the ranks of government, public utility and large 
manufacturing firms. He said it is drawing less heavily from the young and old, 
and from those who work in trades, as unskilled laborers, or for small firms. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, however, Jury Commissioner Alan Slater said juries in the 
county do reflect the community, which tends to be on the older side. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be times when one panel of jurors does not meet the cross section of 
the whole community. But that does not mean the whole selection process is 
flawed. We have been extremely fair," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, the trend, the official said, is "a little bit frightening" 
in light of the long-standing public policy that jurors should reflect as many 
different points of view in the community as possible. 
</P>
<P>
It is most evident in the longest trials, lasting half a year or more, where 
panels tend to be dominated by government employees -- particularly, for 
reasons that are not clear, postal workers. In the Night Stalker case, for 
example, Arce said 24 jurors and alternates were selected and of them eight 
worked for the Postal Service, seven worked for other government agencies and 
four worked for utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Arce said he fears that the trend toward loss of different perspectives could 
spread to more routine cases as the number of small employers who do not pay 
their employees for jury service grows. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the skewing in the longest trials is that government agencies 
and some of the largest firms pay employees their salaries for as long as a 
trial lasts. Most private firms won't pay at all, however, and those that do 
typically pay for only up to 10 days -- the traditional minimum length of jury 
service. Prospective jurors who say they cannot afford to serve on the $5 a day 
the county pays are routinely excused. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Arce said, "if it weren't for the fact that . . . government, 
aerospace, insurance companies (and large manufacturers) . . . were . . . 
subsidizing the system, there would be a serious breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
Arce said he fears that workers for these employers could also wind up 
dominating shorter, more routine trials as the percentage of the work force 
employed by large firms declines. The average trial in Los Angeles Municipal 
and Superior Courts lasts eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Arce pointed to a survey completed this year for United Way, which found that 
smaller businesses -- defined as those with less than 50 employees -- now 
account for 95% of all businesses in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule," Arce said, "businesses with less than 50 employees do not provide 
employees with (paid) jury service leave." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Arce said that paid jury service benefits "disappeared long ago 
from many collective bargaining agreements," resulting in financial harships 
for prospective jurors drawn from ranks of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
He said these benefits were generally eliminated in return for wage hikes, and 
that because courts have been widely viewed as "insensitive" in making good use 
of juror time, there has been no rush to try to win them back. 
</P>
<P>
People with menial jobs -- such as washing cars or busing tables -- rarely show 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arce said that "unless we devise some sort of plan for making sure that all 
areas participate . . . it's going to be an exclusive group that is serving." 
</P>
<P>
He said possible solutions include legislation that would require employers to 
pay workers while they serve on juries, or creation of a public fund to pay 
them.

More than 1,800 of South Korea's leading clergymen Friday accused the 
government of human rights abuses and demanded that it make good on promises of 
democratization and other reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean National Council of Churches said the government of President Roh 
Tae Woo is more undemocratic than that of his dictatorial predecessor and is 
"causing people's lives to collapse with the suppression of human rights." In a 
statement issued after an all-night prayer meeting at a downtown Anglican 
church, the council said more than 800 people were arrested as political 
prisoners in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The church council, which represents leading Protestant clergy in a nation 
where one-fourth of the population is Christian, has been a political force for 
years. But Friday's message was its first major political statement since Roh 
came to power, succeeding Chun Doo Hwan.

TAINTED MILK IS RECALLED BY ADOHR

Santa Ana-based Adohr Farms on Friday recalled more than 30,000 gallons of milk 
and other dairy products contaminated with penicillin, but as much as 5,000 
gallons of the tainted product may have been sold, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The milk, which contains beta-lactam, an antibiotic residue of penicillin, 
could cause an allergic reaction in some people, but does not pose a general 
health risk, state health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The tainted milk contained levels of penicillin "slightly above legal levels," 
said Jan Wessell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture. She cautioned that people sensitive to penicillin should avoid the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dairy Cows Suspected 
</P>
<P>
Officials still are trying to determine how the milk was contaminated but have 
speculated that it could have originated with dairy cows treated with 
penicillin for various ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Products affected by the recall are one-gallon containers of whole milk dated 
Sept. 10, half-gallons of nonfat milk dated Sept. 9 and pints and quarts of 
Nestle's chocolate milk dated Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gary San Filippo, vice president and general manager of Adohr Farms, said 
30,230 gallons of milk were found to have traces of the antibiotic. He said all 
but 5,000 gallons had been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 5,000 gallons that we have not been able to account for, I would think 
a good deal has been sold since it had been on the shelves since early 
Wednesday," San Filippo said. 
</P>
<P>
San Filippo said the milk was shipped this week to 80 7-Eleven Food stores in 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and 40 of the convenience stores 
in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
An Adohr spokeswoman said the recall was a "voluntary precaution," adding that 
no illnesses had been reported. 
</P>
<P>
"State (health officials) have said it is not too much to be concerned about 
because levels in individual cartons are too low to pose a risk," Adohr 
spokeswoman Deborah Sarden said. "We are doing this to ensure there are no 
problems and that nothing could happen." 
</P>
<P>
An ice cream mix -- used to make milkshakes and other products -- that was 
shipped to warehouses, was also found to have traces of penicillin, but company 
officials believe all of that mix has been recovered, Sarden said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they have not determined how or where the penicillin was 
introduced into the milk products. The company buys its milk from independent 
dairies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inquiry Opened 
</P>
<P>
The contamination was discovered Thursday, after the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture conducted tests on the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Adohr officials have begun an inquiry into why the company's own tests did not 
reveal the contamination, San Filippo said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strict policy in testing all incoming milk by two different 
tests that should indicate the presence of antibiotics," he said. "It appears 
there was a failure in methodology, either with the people who handled this or 
with the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state health officials said they are investigating the source of the 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
All farmers are supposed to ensure that immunized dairy cows are separated from 
those used for production, Wessell said. The dairy at fault in this instance 
could face suspension, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"This shouldn't have happened. Dairies are supposed to keep this from 
happening," Wessell said. "Our concern would be to stop operations until we 
have assurances that there is an adequate system for segregating cows and that 
there is no possibility of contamination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Karen Minor, a dairy buyer for the San Diego division of Southland Corp., which 
owns the 7-Eleven chain, said her company had received no consumer complaints 
or calls from individual stores about the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Adohr at about 8 a.m., and they indicated they had gone out to 
stores and were reasonably sure the products were all pulled," Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
She said milk sales at their stores were not disrupted because Adohr was able 
to deliver fresh, untainted milk the same day.

FAA WILL DISCOURAGE FUTURE RECORD FLIGHTS BY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration will try to discourage future 
record-breaking flights by children, such as Tony Aliengena's 22,000-mile, 
globe-circling trip earlier this summer, a high-ranking FAA official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"People do it for the publicity," said Gabe Bruno, general manager of the FAA's 
general aviation operations branch in Washington. "It leaves the public with 
the impression that there are a bunch of kids flying around out there, and 
that's simply not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Tony, 11, of San Juan Capistrano, and his father, Gary, an experienced pilot 
who accompanied him on the "Friendship Flight," were vacationing with other 
family members in Utah on Friday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Their trip, which involved stops in seven countries, including the Soviet 
Union, began June 5 and ended July 22 at John Wayne Airport, with Tony becoming 
the youngest person to pilot a plane around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the state Senate unanimously passed a resolution honoring 
Tony for his "courage" in piloting the single-engine Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
But the flight generated considerable controversy, with many commercial and 
general aviation pilots arguing that because Gary Aliengena was aboard, 
coaching his son, the feat was drawing undue attention and was undercutting 
public confidence in air safety. 
</P>
<P>
In June, for example, a Seattle pilot wrote to the FAA to criticize the 
Aliengenas' flight as an unsafe "publicity stunt." FAA Acting General Aviation 
Manager Louis C. Cusimano's written reply stated: 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that these recent flights by youngsters may have served to 
reduce public confidence in the safety of the aviation system. Therefore, we 
will be actively working with general aviation organizations and flight 
instructors to discourage such actions in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence, written in June, was obtained this week by The Times under 
the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Cusimano was unavailable Friday, but Bruno, his deputy, said that the FAA is 
simply encouraging aviation organizations to take a second look at flights by 
children, because federal laws do not currently allow the agency to totally ban 
such flights as long as a licensed pilot, such as Tony's father, is aboard and 
takes responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of flight has not created a problem until the last couple of years," 
Bruno said. "In all the cases that we know of, proper procedures have been 
followed. I wouldn't say that there's a safety issue here -- it's an image type 
of thing. It leaves the public with the wrong impression." 
</P>
<P>
General aviation pilots and their organizations generally supported the FAA's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of educational opportunities for youngsters interested in 
aviation," said Frank White, director of public affairs for the 295,000-member 
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn., the world's largest pilots' group. "We prefer 
to see those opportunities explored through more legitimate channels, such as 
the Aviation Explorer program and the Boy Scouts. These flights by young people 
tend to trivialize the flight instruction process." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Wilcox, 34, a pilot at Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport, said the 
FAA's latest stance is "as it should be." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was made too much of to begin with," said Wilcox, who got his 
pilot's license at 17, the minimum age. "It's a great adventure for Tony. . . . 
But it gives the public the feeling that inexperienced people are playing 
around in the air system, and that's not a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
But not all aviation experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Vi Smith, an aviation author and historian who helped Martin Aviation prepare 
for the Aliengenas' departure from and return to John Wayne Airport, attributed 
the FAA's statements to negative reaction "from an uninformed public." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that some reporters pointed out how Gary Aliengena was 
actually in charge during "Friendship Flight," Smith said such information was 
not repeated strongly or often enough. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said Friday that it is still investigating the July 18 crash of the 
Aliengenas' plane in Golovin, Alaska. The crash occurred with Tony's father at 
the controls during an impromptu fishing trip during a break in the flight 
around the world. Initially, Gary Aliengena said he didn't know what caused the 
crash. But a day later he told FAA investigators that he had mistaken a taxiway 
for the runway and did not have enough room or speed to become airborne. The 
Cessna ended up in a ditch.

CITY WORKER HIT, KILLED BY CAREENING AUTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city maintenance worker was killed Friday after he and a highway inspector 
were struck by a car that had just collided with another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was hit by 
a Ford Escort at about 3 p.m. Friday as he was working with an highway 
inspector on the intersection on Lambert Road and State College Boulevard, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford, which was driven by a 19-year-old Montclair man, was westbound on 
Lambert when it collided with a Honda Accord driven by a 35-year-old Brea 
woman, who was southbound on State College Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was taken to Brea Community Hospital, where he died of severe 
injuries. The highway inspector, whose name was also not released, was taken to 
UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
A Brea police spokeswoman said neither driver was cited or held pending further 
investigation.

CONFERENCE BRINGS TOGETHER 600 OF AREA'S BRIGHTEST YOUNGSTERS

Twelve-year-old Jerry Landers wants to own his own National Football League 
team when he grows up, so attending a workshop that teaches how to create and 
manage a business sounded like a great opportunity to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't just like to play the game," said Landers, a pupil at Harry C. Fulton 
Middle School in Fountain Valley. "It is much more to the game than what the 
players do on the field, and that's the part I am interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry was just one of more than 600 youths invited Friday to participate in 
Kidscon West, a three-day conference with workshops and exhibits especially 
designed for gifted and talented children. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters who attended the conference were either in gifted classes in their 
schools or were recommended as academically talented by their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Gifted children require a certain amount of nurturing and attention for their 
various interests," said Jacqui Jeffery, coordinator of the conference. "This 
is to give students and parents alike ideas on how to work with the curiosity 
and thinking of these children." 
</P>
<P>
Along with advice on entrepreneurship, children in grades four through nine 
were also offered workshops on the language of computers, U.S. consumer safety, 
treasure finding and Wall Street, to name a few. The workshops were taught by 
professionals from each field. 
</P>
<P>
Registration was $60 per child with an extra $25 fee for parents interested in 
attending the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffery said she developed her interest in gifted children after teaching for 
more than 20 years in a Santa Barbara school district. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt there was not enough encouragement given to these children, 
and there were certainly no programs in my teaching district aimed for this 
type of child," Landers said. "Research proves that without encouragement, a 
gifted child stops asking questions." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, she applied for -- and received -- a state grant that allowed her to 
sponsor her first mini-conference with nine workshops in the Santa Barbara 
area. This year's first statewide effort includes more than 80 workshops for 
children and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"As a parent, I am inclined to feel that not enough is being done to reach to 
the gifted child," said Glenn Wallace, whose 12-year-old son is in a gifted 
program in Agoura. "Something that deals with the boredom and lack of challenge 
these kids must feel in a classroom filled with many other kids who really 
don't want to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Drew Wilson, a former teacher and creator of the video "Mr.Edison's Invention 
Factory," a one-man show that encourages students to develop their own 
inventions, feels that more attention on the gifted child is imperative to the 
nation's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, children, particularly gifted ones, have been encouraged to take 
their ideas a step further for years," Wilson said. "But in America, only now 
are we focusing on shaping the kids' minds in this way, and we have a lot of 
catching up to do." 
</P>
<P>
Kidscon will travel to Orlando, Fla., in January and to Washington in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
There also are plans for the program to expand to include all elementary grades 
and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
"We want these kids to realize that there are horizons beyond the classrooms 
and that they are capable of reaching them," Jeffery said.

COURT TO HEAR LEWIS CHALLENGE OF CHARGES

The trial of Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) was delayed Friday by the 3rd 
District Court of Appeal, which will decide whether the state forgery law 
applies to charges that Lewis used former President Ronald Reagan's name 
without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewis trial had been scheduled to begin Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lewis' attorneys argued that the state's 100-year-old forgery statute 
applies only in cases where the intent is to defraud people of money or 
property. Sacramento Superior Court Judge James I. Morris rejected the defense 
argument in April and ordered the trial to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good for Us' 
</P>
<P>
But the appellate court, in an order issued by Presiding Justice Robert K. 
Puglia, agreed to hear arguments on the legal question, in effect postponing 
the trial until the issue is decided. 
</P>
<P>
"From a lawyer's standpoint, this is good for us," said Clyde M. Blackmon, one 
of Lewis' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
If the appeals court rules in Lewis' favor, the lawmaker would not have to 
stand trial on the forgery charge. Blackmon said it is unclear when the court 
will hear the matter and issue an opinion, but it has given the two sides until 
the end of the month to present further written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislative Races 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was indicted in February by the Sacramento County Grand Jury, which 
charged him with one felony count for his role in mailing out hundreds of 
thousands of campaign letters bearing the phony Reagan signature during the 
1986 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to grand jury testimony, letters were sent in six legislative races 
even though the White House had denied permission for the Assembly Republicans 
to use Reagan's signature. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest of the letters was one accusing Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson) of "caving in to the powerful underworld drug industry" -- a charge 
that led to demands by Floyd and others that the Republican leaders responsible 
be prosecuted.

IRVINE SURVEY OKS TOLLWAYS PLAN BY 80% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine residents overwhelmingly support the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway 
and two other proposed county toll roads, according to preliminary results of a 
city survey tallied Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The results show that more than 80% of those surveyed want Irvine to continue 
to participate in the planning of the San Joaquin Hills, Foothill and Eastern 
toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was pleased with the results, saying the survey gives 
Irvine additional clout to promote its scaled-back proposals for the toll 
roads. The plans voted on by Irvine residents include fewer traffic lanes than 
originally proposed, plus fixed-rail mass transit systems, "not the massive 
1950s-style freeways" first put forth by toll-road planners, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The results also appear to end the saga of a residents' challenge to the city's 
involvement in the roadways' planning and financing. The Committee of Seven 
Thousand in 1985 collected 7,000 signatures for a "citizen's-right-to-vote" 
initiative that would have required voter approval of city fees to help pay for 
the proposed San Joaquin Hills, Foothill and Eastern corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative was challenged in court by the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California and other business and transportation groups. The challenge 
ultimately was heard by the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the highway 
project was of statewide importance and thus not subject to local initiative. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling led to the advisory survey, conducted in August. Although the 
results were not binding, Agran had said he planned to abide by the results, 
and the survey was conducted much like an election, but by mail. 
</P>
<P>
The city clerk sent ballots to 56,400 registered voters, accompanied by a 
detailed pamphlet that outlined the corridor plans and included an argument in 
favor of the corridors, signed by the entire City Council. No one filed 
arguments opposing the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the city clerk said 12,852, or about 22%, returned the 
ballots, and all but 1,500 had been counted Friday afternoon. Final results 
will be announced Tuesday, but Friday's tally showed that 10,309 residents, or 
81.7%, favor the San Joaquin Hill toll road, compared to 2,085, or 18.3%, who 
oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the city's support of the agency planning the Eastern and 
Foothill tollways, 10,498 respondents -- or 83.5% -- were in favor, and 2,085 
-- or 16.5% -- voted no. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Committee of Seven Thousand could not be reached Friday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The $560-million San Joaquin Hills Corridor would run from the Costa Mesa 
Freeway southeast to Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Corridor, estimated at $670 million, would run along the county's 
eastern foothills and connect Rancho Santa Margarita with central Orange 
County. The proposed Eastern Corridor, at a cost of $840 million, would be an 
inland north-south toll road linking the Riverside Freeway with the Irvine 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absolutely fantastic and terrific news to start the holiday on," 
said Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, a proponent of the corridors. He said the 
survey results bode well for the county's proposed half-cent sales tax hike, 
which will go before voters in November, because "this shows people are 
interested in solving the transportation problems." 
</P>
<P>
The survey results also were applauded by the director of the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies, which oversees the efforts for the three toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted," said John Meyer, executive director. "We certainly have come 
a long way in accommodating the concerns of the city of Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
He said the "scaled-back" plan for the San Joaquin Hills toll road referred to 
by Mayor Agran is one of two configurations that will be studied in an 
environmental impact report. The original plan calls for four lanes in each 
direction, plus a car-pool lane, while the scaled-back plan calls for a total 
of five lanes, including one reverse-direction lane, plus facilities for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
The scaled-back plans came as a result of agreements between Irvine and Newport 
Beach, in the case of the San Joaquin Hills tollway, and with Orange and Tustin 
for the other corridors, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans include roadways that "can move people in greater numbers without 
necessarily degrading the environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because those plans now have the endorsement of Irvine residents, Irvine city 
officials will have more clout in pressing for the adoption of the scaled-back 
configurations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plans now have enhanced credibility. With the voter ratification, we hope 
we will be able to prevail with our point of view. There are still some out 
there who want to pave over the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the mood of Irvine residents was more opposed to the toll roads five 
years ago, when the petitioning group first formed, the increasing traffic in 
Irvine and the rest of Orange County since then has heightened residents' 
awareness, said Meyer of the transportation corridor agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizens in Irvine are more cognizant of traffic problems now," he said.

JUDGE BLOCKS PRINTING OF TAX MEASURE BALLOT ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Friday blocked the printing of ballot documents both supporting and 
opposing the proposed countywide half-cent sales tax for transportation 
projects, ruling that more time is needed to sort out mutual charges of 
inaccuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore set a hearing for Friday to take up both 
sides' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all registered voters in Orange County must receive a pamphlet 
before the Nov. 7 general election and it must include written arguments for 
and against all measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Reed, the treasurer of Citizens for Measure M, the group supporting the 
tax, filed the lawsuit seeking a court order directing county election 
officials to remove allegedly false statements from the ballot argument against 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Reed targeted a claim that approval of the sales tax would lead to "massive 
indebtedness" of "$18 billion, plus interest" because the county would be able 
to borrow more with the new revenue. He said that a public utilities code 
limits bond indebtedness to $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would raise $3.1 billion for highway and transportation projects over 
the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Russell Burkett, a named defendant in Reed's suit, filed papers 
alleging in turn that endorsements contained in the ballot arguments by 
supporters are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents listed the names of nine persons supporting the proposal. Four are 
identified with the names of organizations with which they have been 
affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett contended that the tactic suggests "that the organizations have 
themselves endorsed Measure M." He said that the law requires a signed consent 
of the organization be included in the ballot statement, and that none had 
filed such a consent. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, the chairman of Citizens for Yes on M, said such listings used 
were meant as descriptions of what the people do, not necessarily an 
endorsement by the groups . 
</P>
<P>
"Under no conditions do we feel that this is misleading at all," he said. "It's 
a description of what these people do in life. It was not meant that these 
organizations endorsed it." 
</P>
<P>
In dispute are the listings of: Randy Goodwin, former executive director, 
Howard Jarvis Tax Reduction Movement; Audrey Redfearn, chair, Democratic 
Foundation of Orange County; Charlotte Mousel, Republican national 
committeewoman; and Bob Balgenorth, executive secretary, Orange County Building 
Trades Council, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Hanna, the executive director of the Democratic Foundation, said her 
organization endorsed the sales tax Aug. 27, but didn't file papers with the 
county's registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Haskin, the executive director of the Republican Party of Orange County, 
said the Republican National Committee had not taken a position on the tax and 
probably would not.

TITANS HOPE TO START WITH CHANGE OF PACE IN FOOTBALL OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KALB, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Wright can point to the spot, and so can Northern Illinois Coach Jerry 
Pettibone. 
</P>
<P>
Right down there in the south end zone. Left sideline. Inside the one-yard 
line. Call it the one-foot line. 
</P>
<P>
That was where Wright gave Cal State Fullerton a victory here two years ago, 
when he forced Keith Hurley out of bounds on a two-point conversion attempt 
after Northern Illinois had scored with no time left. That was how Fullerton 
won, 21-20, en route to a 6-6 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans are back at Huskie Stadium today, this time to open their season. 
Another clean slate, waiting to be marked. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Wright isn't an inexperienced sophomore, but a senior, a starting 
outside linebacker and one of only three returning starters on the Titan 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will be trying to break a couple of trends today. One is a string of 
three years without a winning season. The other is a little problem with 
openers. The Titans haven't won an opening game since 1984, losing their past 
four openers to Montana, Nevada Reno, Hawaii and Southwestern Louisiana, all on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy has been saddled with a difficult nonconference 
schedule in recent years. Grant that much. But the degree of difficulty of 
those openers is not very high. And not only has Fullerton lost to some 
mediocre teams, but the Titans have been beaten badly, losing to Nevada Reno by 
46 points, to Hawaii by 44 and to Southwest Louisiana by 15. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy would rather "just try to play and win," than ponder what troubles the 
Titans in openers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't brought it up," Murphy said. "What are we supposed to do, tell them 
how long it's been since they've been able to win one?" 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the most-recent opening victory was in 1984, 27-25 over Boise 
State. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern Illinois, Fullerton meets a team that Pettibone thinks "turned the 
corner" last season with a 7-4 season that included a victory over Wisconsin, 
the school's first victory over a Big Ten team. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have a large part of that team back, including linebacker Ron 
DeLisi, who had 171 tackles last season, fifth among Division I players. 
</P>
<P>
The major concern has been quarterback, where Stacey Robinson has replaced 
Marshall Taylor as director of the Huskies' wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done real well," Pettibone said, "but he doesn't have a lot of experience 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Playing Northern Illinois has been a sign of good times in the past for 
Fullerton. There was the victory last time, and there was a 20-13 loss in 1983. 
But that loss came in the California Bowl, when the Huskies were members of the 
Mid-American Conference. The Cal Bowl, loss or no loss, is a pleasant memory 
for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
As is the victory here last time. 
</P>
<P>
Not so much so for Pettibone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that," Pettibone said. "We went like 61 yards in I think 49 
seconds for the touchdown. Then we lined up and went for the two. We didn't 
make it. I can see the option play, see Marshall Taylor pitch the ball to Keith 
Hurley, see him go right over the pylon. It was close." 
</P>
<P>
Wright remembers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent the lead back to cut me, take me low. I took him on and stood up to 
him. The only way for (the ballcarrier) to get in was through me, and through 
(safety Mike Schaffel). I got a piece of him, and he didn't get in. It was 
really close." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Tony Dill, who has been bothered by a hamstring injury, made the trip. 
He is not expected to start, but Coach Gene Murphy said he will play. . . . 
Murphy said kicker/punter Phil Nevin is "fine," despite a partially torn tendon 
in his kicking foot that kept him from practicing for about six days.

NEW-LOOK BREA-OLINDA MIGHT PUSH VALENCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valencia High School has won or shared six consecutive Orange League 
championships. And there's no reason to think this season will be any 
different. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers again are favored to win the league title, according to the league's 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition is certainly on their side. In addition to the six consecutive league 
titles, Valencia has been to three consecutive Southern Section championship 
games. The Tigers are 32-4-2 with two of the losses coming in championship 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, they lost to Corona del Mar, 17-7, in the Division VI 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest question in the league is how much Brea-Olinda has improved and 
whether the Wildcats can stop Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Brea has finally escaped its ancient campus on Birch Street and moved to a 
sparkling new campus on, get this, Wildcat Way. That means the Wildcats 
actually have their own stadium, so there will be no more "home" games against 
Western at Western. 
</P>
<P>
There are other changes in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Savanna have new coaches. Raul Victores takes over for Ted Mullen, 
who had led the Colonists to a Southern Section championship game in 1987. Fred 
DiPalma takes over at Savanna for Dana Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia is trying to turn its fortunes around after a 3-6-1 season. And 
Western will have another hard-hitting, aggressive team. 
</P>
<P>
But it figures to be another championship season for Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Valencia because of the tradition," Western Coach Jim Howell said. "And 
the coaching." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at Valencia (as an assistant coach) the last two years and they're 
always going to be good," DiPalma said. "They've got to be picked to be 
somewhere at the top." 
</P>
<P>
The other coaches agree. 
</P>
<P>
Brea appears to be the best of the rest with Anaheim and Western not far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM -- No team has undergone as many significant changes as Anaheim. Mullen 
left to seek semi-retirement as an assistant coach at Palm Desert. Johnny 
Mountain, the Colonists' leading rusher last season, and quarterback Dan 
Pacillas, who passed for more than 1,000 yards, have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Victores has nine starters back from last season's 7-5 
team that reached the quarterfinals of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Jason Gold, a 6-2, 215 senior, returns to anchor the Colonists' 
defense, which Victores said is the team's strength. Gold was second-team 
all-league as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
BREA-OLINDA -- Why is Brea likely to be the most improved team in the league? 
The Wildcats have 15 starters back. Nine have started for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Marlow, a two-time all-league performer, returns at quarterback. Last 
season, Marlow completed 100 of 178 passes for 1,431 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Jon Kobz, offensive lineman Joe Mogarte and defensive end Dean Snyder 
were first-team all-league performers last season. Snyder was the Wildcats' 
leading tackler. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stewart, who was a second team all-league running back in 1988, will counted 
on to lead the rushing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Contending for the league championship and securing a playoff berth are Brea 
Coach Jon Looney's chief goals this season. With the cast he has, neither goal 
is unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
MAGNOLIA -- Tony DiThomas instilled some needed discipline last season. He 
kicked 18 players off the team after they refused to sign a letter 
acknowledging their part in a postgame fight with Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining players and DiThomas have formed a united front to improve upon a 
3-6-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
There are positive signs. The junior varsity had a 7-3 record last season. 
Seniors Elliot Parker, at quarterback, Trent Comer, at receiver/defensive back, 
and Pat McNeil, at tailback/linebacker, are the Sentinels' top players. Grantt 
Rowan, a lineman, and Jernique Mitchell, a running back/linebacker, are juniors 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of experience -- only four starters are back from last season -- and lack 
of size -- only a handful of players weigh more than 200 pounds -- will be the 
team's weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
SAVANNA -- The school has suffered through one agonizing season after another 
recently. The Rebels have won six games in the past five seasons. Last season, 
they were outscored, 334-55, and defeated only Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Into this bleak picture steps DiPalma, a former assistant at league power 
Valencia. Whether he can do anything to change Savanna's fortunes remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to attempt to change the attitude of the players," DiPalma said. 
"They have to believe in themselves, which they're starting to do. They have to 
believe that they can win, that they're not losers." 
</P>
<P>
He does have one of the league's top running backs in senior Kenison PoChing. 
Also a linebacker, PoChing is a bruising runner, who was a second-team 
all-league selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Robledo returns at quarterback, giving the team added experience in the 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Linemen Michael George, 6-4, 285, and Robert Landis, 6-3, 260, have size and 
should open holes for PoChing and give Robledo time to throw. 
</P>
<P>
VALENCIA -- The Tigers have lost the top players in the league last season to 
graduation: Guy Sheppard, the league MVP who caught 34 passes and had eight 
interceptions; Keef Leasure, the back of the year; Steve Rangel, the lineman of 
the year, and Tracy Garrett, an all-league quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Why then are the Tigers favored to win another league title? 
</P>
<P>
Coaching, a solid group of newcomers and tradition. Mike Marrujo is in his 
ninth season as coach. Quarterback Richard Wells leads a run-dominanted 
offense. A 32-4-2 record in the last three seasons ranks as one of the top 
marks in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia is fourth ranked in the the Southern Section Division VI preseason 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Wilson, a receiver/defensive back, Jose Castillo, a nose guard, Paul 
Jaramillo, a defensive lineman, and Kim Young, an offensive lineman, are among 
the Tigers' top veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
WESTERN -- The Pioneers limped through a 4-7 season in 1988, but were able to 
grab third place and qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Howell said he would be disappointed if the Pioneers finished any lower than 
third this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing right now for us is for some of the younger kids to develop," 
Howell said. "We've got to get them to come along to get some depth. We want to 
get our juniors to be a little better looking players." 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers' have a solid group of seniors, including Tommy Cowen, a tackle 
who was a first-team all-league defensive lineman. Robert Southern, at center 
and defensive end, Corey Manlinguis, at linebacker, Gilbert Brito, at receiver, 
and Gabriel Ramirez, at receiver, also were all-league performers. 
</P>
<P>
Brito and Erik Dowell, who was a starting defensive end last season, will 
compete for the quarterback spot.

LIGHTWEIGHT BANGLES DON'T DAZZLE -- OR DISAPPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you adjust your expectations properly, you won't be disappointed by a 
Bangles concert. 
</P>
<P>
Properly means: Don't expect music that's too complex or challenging, don't 
expect much virtuosity (or that the four women will even be playing their 
instruments), don't expect the best songs to be Bangles compositions and don't 
expect the set to be very long. 
</P>
<P>
You can expect a no-frills blast of enormously engaging and buoyant pop-rock, 
four solid lead singers and plenty of lovely four-part harmonies and, overall, 
a dose of lightweight, escapist entertainment ideally suited for a late-summer 
evening or for kicking off a holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with a night so grounded in expectation, the Bangles' concert 
Thursday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa offered few surprises. The 
quartet still opens with a rockin' reworking of Paul Simon's "Hazy Shade of 
Winter" and closes with Liam Sternberg's superbly silly "Walk Like an Egyptian" 
-- just like it did in its shows last April. 
</P>
<P>
Most bands would change their sets over the months; you don't necessarily 
expect the Bangles to. And there's even something oddly comforting about that 
kind of familiarity. It's like watching a "Mr. Ed" rerun: You know how it's 
going to come out, but you still get a goofy kick out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the songs remained the same, there was some verbal business that 
made Thursday's show a little different. For starters, before launching into 
Jules Shear's "If She Knew What She Wants" (another good song not written by 
the group), singer-guitarist Susanna Hoffs recounted the history of the band, 
explaining how it formed in her parents' garage one night in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
(It seemed, though, as if Hoffs was rewriting that history a bit. Original 
bassist Annette Zilinskas would have been surprised to learn that the four 
women "you see up here" were in the garage that night eight years ago. 
Similarly, the earliest fans of the group (from back when it was called the 
Bangs) might have been surprised to learn that on that same night, the women 
"became the Bangles.") 
</P>
<P>
Another verbal wrinkle was bassist Michael Steele's reminder that she was on 
home turf: "I grew up around Balboa Island," said Steele, the sassiest Bangle, 
before announcing she was "president of the Rob Lowe Freedom Fund" and 
dedicating "Complicated Girl" to him. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it was pretty much Bangles business as usual, with the foursome 
(augmented by a keyboardist) in fine form. Are they really as good as they 
sounded, though? Any time two songs are performed with taped accompaniment (in 
this case "Eternal Flame" and "Walk Like an Egyptian"), it raises a troubling 
question: Is the rest of the show live, or is it Memorex? 
</P>
<P>
This issue was probably moot to the audience, especially toward the end, when 
it was whipped into a sock-hop frenzy by a rip-roaring rock block of "In Your 
Room," "Hero Takes a Fall," "Walking Down Your Street" and the truly grand 
finale of "Walk Like an Egyptian," when the band invited some members of the 
crowd on stage to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
The show was over after a scant 75 minutes, and that's pretty much what we 
expected, too. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the performance by the opening act, the Untouchables, wasn't 
what we expected, at least initially. Orange County traditionally has been a 
major stronghold for this ska/reggae/soul/R&amp;B outfit; folks generally flock 
to local U.T. shows and immediately go bonkers to the group's frenetic dance 
music pop-pourri. But neither the band nor the audience seemed to get down to 
business Tuesday until the final moments. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few possible explanations: At the outset, the crowd was quite small 
(hundreds more filed in during the UTs' set) and unusually sedate -- maybe 
because it was still light out, but maybe because most of the first few songs 
were only so-so. In any case, departed singer Chuck Askerneese -- the 
pint-size, remarkably animated front man who used to dart around the stage 
nonstop -- was sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, though, when it was dark and the audience was much larger and 
finally afflicted with dance fever, the band kicked into overdrive with what 
continue to be three of its best tunes: "Wild Child," "Free Yourself" and its 
eminently peppy version of "(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone." That was more like 
it, for all concerned.

COUPLE SING ELIAS' PRAISES

<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I attended Diane Elias' recital at St. Andrew's Presbyterian 
Church, and we were disappointed with Bruce Burroughs' review ("Mezzo Diane 
Elias in Hometown Newport Recital," Calendar, Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
We thoroughly enjoyed the choice of songs and the singing as well as the 
opportunity to hear Miss Elias sing. 
</P>
<P>
We do not agree with Mr. Burroughs' review.

A NEW 'MAGIC FLUTE' TO PLAY FIRST NOTE OF UCI SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither Robert Cohen nor his wife, Lorna, speaks German. Yet they've come up 
with a new English translation of the Mozart opera "The Magic Flute" to launch 
the fall theater season at UC Irvine in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We speak tourist German," said Robert Cohen, who is the chairman of the UCI 
drama department. "But all the German there is is in the dictionary. The 
translation of meaning is not the difficulty; it's setting the words to the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by the fact that he cannot read music either, Cohen said he learned 
the score "note by note" from listening repeatedly to the 18th-Century work on 
his compact disc player. 
</P>
<P>
"The translation is true to the text, down to the rhymes and the syllables," he 
contended. "And we are doing the whole opera -- uncut as far as we know." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen will also direct the production, which he describes as "a very creative 
version." It will begin conventionally, he said, but will "deconstruct in 
performance" and will have "both museum and contemporary elements." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his best-known book, "Acting Power," has been translated into 
Estonian and will be published in the Soviet Union in the spring "if," he said, 
"Estonia is still in the Soviet Union by then." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also has written a new book, entitled "Acting Shakespeare," that will be 
published by the California-based Mayfield Publishing Co. in June. A revised 
edition of another book, "Acting Professionally," was brought out in July. It 
is, according to Stacy Keach, who is quoted on the dust jacket, "the bible for 
young people aspiring to become actors." 
</P>
<P>
WAIT! THERE'S MORE: With "The Magic Flute" (Nov. 9 through 18 at the Fine Arts 
Village Theatre) will be four other productions in the main UCI subscription 
series: 
</P>
<P>
* Racine's "Phaedra," directed by Keith Fowler, Jan. 25 to Feb. 3 at the Fine 
Arts Concert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
* Clifford Odets' "Golden Boy," directed by Eli Simon, March 8 through 17 at 
the Fine Arts Village Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* "Man of La Mancha," directed by Earl Weaver and Dennis Castellano, March 8 
through 17 at the Fine Arts Little Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* Odon von Horvath's "Oktoberfest," directed by Dudley Knight, April 26 through 
May 5 at the Fine Arts Village Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
A new subscription series of Stage 2 productions directed by second- and 
third-year graduate students includes Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," Nov. 29 
through Dec. 2 at the Little Theatre; an ancient Hindu play, "Shakuntala," Feb. 
22 through 24 at the Studio Theatre; and Alfred Jarry's "Ubu Roi," April 6 
through 28 at the Studio Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
And a UCI cabaret will be offered off campus Monday evenings at the Hotel 
Laguna in Laguna Beach, showcasing the musical talent of the drama department. 
The first show will be Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
CHECKING THE TECHIES: In response to a national recruiting campaign, about 50 
candidates have applied for the job of technical director at the Irvine 
Theatre. Whoever gets the job will run the day-to-day operations of the 
$17.6-million facility, according to general manager Douglas Rankin. The 
theater, being built on the UCI campus, is scheduled for completion in August, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin, who will meet the small number of finalists next week, has impaneled a 
three-member committee to help interview them. The three are Cameron Harvey, an 
associate dean at UCI and a drama professor; Dan Trevino, artistic director of 
the Irvine-based South Coast Musical Theatre and chairman of the University 
High School performing arts department, and Ken Lazette, representing the city 
of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten applications from people at universities, from arts centers and a 
number from resident theaters," Rankin said this week. "We will pay 
competitively because we want talent." 
</P>
<P>
Rankin said that he hopes to name a technical director within a month and that 
he expects to have "eight or nine full-time staffers" on board when the doors 
open. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a nine-member committee has been meeting to establish 
programming policy for the theater. Rankin said he expects to announce "in late 
October or early November" the names of the arts groups, winnowed from more 
than 100 applicants, that will be invited to perform at the theater during its 
first year of operation.

NEW YORK PROVIDES FEMALE CHARACTERS, IMAGES FOR 'COOKIE' DIRECTOR'S MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While growing up in Philadelphia, Susan Seidelman didn't think much about 
filmmaking. Chases through Independence Hall never popped into her head. 
Neither did love scenes at the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time she had started film school at New York University, Seidelman 
was an aspiring director on the lookout for material: Manhattan was there for 
the taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think New York is as big a character as the actors in my films," said 
Seidelman, the director of "Smithereens," "Desperately Seeking Susan" and the 
recently released "Cookie," all based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The diversity of people that live here . . . below 14th Street, you have SoHo, 
which is artsy. Nearby is Wall Street, which has lawyers and stockbrokers. 
Nearby you have Chinatown and then Little Italy, where you can still see people 
hanging out in the stoops and talking on folding chairs." 
</P>
<P>
Proudly calling herself a New York filmmaker, Seidelman's first impressions of 
the city came through movies, especially the 1961 adaptation of Truman Capote's 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's." She related to stories of women moving to New York, 
finding small apartments and doing their best to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
In her own films, Seidelman is attracted to characters such as Susan Berman in 
"Smithereens," Madonna in "Desperately Seeking Susan" and Emily Lloyd in 
"Cookie": women struggling to find themselves under layers of hair, makeup and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are looking for independence or individuality. There is something 
about those girls that's incredibly similar. The way they dress, even though 
they're trying to be outrageous, is similar," Seidelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in a time when we're influenced by pop culture and the idols of 
our day. They're rebellious, but in an acceptable form." 
</P>
<P>
"Cookie" stars Peter Falk as mobster Dino Capisco, on parole after serving 13 
years for labor racketeering. Lloyd plays his rebellious, gum-chewing daughter 
and Dianne Wiest, her mother. 
</P>
<P>
The film was not Seidelman's creation -- the script was written by Nora Ephron 
and Alice Arlen -- but the director saw similarities to her earlier films and 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
"You can draw a line from Wren in 'Smithereens' to Madonna in 'Desperately 
Seeking Susan' to 'Cookie.' Those women are cousins," Seidelman said. "I was a 
Cookie when I was growing up. I had different clothes and different hair, but I 
felt the same way." 
</P>
<P>
"Smithereens," was an underground favorite in 1982, appreciated more by critics 
than the general public. "Desperately Seeking Susan," a quirky comedy starring 
Rosanna Arquette as a suburban housewife who gets amnesia and trades identities 
with a bohemian pop singer (Madonna), was a surprise hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous about 'Desperately Seeking Susan,' " Seidelman said. "I knew it 
was going to rely on the tone, whether the audience would go along with her 
running into a pole and getting amnesia." 
</P>
<P>
Next came "Making Mr. Right," Seidelman's only film to take place outside New 
York, starring Ann Magnuson as a woman who falls in love with a robot (John 
Malkovich). Filming went smoothly and the subject seemed right for the box 
office, but "Making Mr. Right" flopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I had much more fun making 'Mr. Right' than 'Desperately Seeking Susan.' It 
was the warmest atmosphere I ever worked on. But I've learned that there's no 
correlation between the mood on the set and the box office. We were all in 
Miami, living in the same hotel together. It was a little like camp." 
</P>
<P>
Directing, Seidelman has learned, can be a full-time job. Three years ago, she 
happened to pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's quirky novel, "The Lives and Loves 
of a She-Devil," the story of an ugly woman who alters her body and her life to 
seek revenge on a philandering husband. A week later, the book was finished and 
her wheels were spinning. The film version, starring Meryl Streep and Roseanne 
Barr, is due for release at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go into a bookstore," Seidelman said, "part of me is looking for 
pleasure and part of me is thinking what would make a good movie. A lot of 
books, before they're published, go out in manuscript forms to the studios. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised how easily I got the rights to 'She-Devil.' It came out in 
1983 and I didn't read it until three years later. Now I see it in the 
best-seller racks." 
</P>
<P>
An excellent British film version of the book was shown over PBS channels two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the streets, too, Seidelman lets nothing get past her, catching moments 
of people's lives and storing them for future films. 
</P>
<P>
"I was walking downtown and this guy and girl were obviously having a fight. 
She has probably locked him out of the apartment. In my mind, I'm assuming they 
live together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was down below and she was up on the third floor, tossing his record 
albums, pulling them out of the covers and throwing them down in the street 
like Frisbees. You had all these shattered record albums on the street -- what 
a great image!"
